    "two - particle intensity interferometry , commonly known as hbt interferometry is one of the efficient ways to know the space - time description of particle emission zone created in high energy nucleus - nucleus collisions  @xcite .",
    "this method was formulated and exploited by hanbury , brown and twiss to measure the angular diameter of astronomical objects  @xcite .",
    "it was first introduced in heavy ion collision ( hic ) through pion interferometry which provided valuable information about the space - time description of the system at the freeze out surface only  @xcite .",
    "it has been argued that in contrast to hadrons , two - particle intensity interferometry of photons and dileptons  @xcite which are produced throughout the space - time evolution of the reaction zone and which suffer almost no interactions with the surrounding medium can provide information on the the history of the evolution of the hot matter created in hic .",
    "however photons appear to be a more restrictive probe since they are characterized only by their transverse momentum ( @xmath1 ) whereas the dileptons have two kinematic variables , @xmath1 and invariant mass(m ) to play with . a soft photon ( low @xmath1 ) in one frame of reference can be hard ( high @xmath1 ) in another frame , whereas @xmath1 integrated invariant mass distribution of dileptons is independent of any frame .",
    "in addition to it , @xmath1 spectra is affected by the flow , however , @xmath1 integrated m spectra remain unaltered by the flow in the system  @xcite .",
    "also in the m spectra of dileptons , above @xmath2 peak , dileptons from qgp dominates over its hadronic counterpart  @xcite .",
    "all these suggests that a judicious choice of @xmath1 and m windows will be very useful to characterize the qgp and hadronic phase separately .",
    "moreover owing to rapid longitudinal expansion at the onset of qgp phase compared to the partonic interaction rate , the anisotropy arises in @xmath3 plane with @xmath4 in the local rest frame . with time , such asymmetry dies out with secondary partonic interactions .",
    "after which the system is considered to be isotropic and thermal at proper time @xmath5 and beyond @xmath6 the system can be treated hydrodynamically . to include such momentum anisotropy in pre - equilibrium stage of qgp , a simple phenomenological model is adopted from refs .",
    "we assumed two time scales here ; ( i ) the initial qgp formation time , @xmath7 , and ( ii ) the isotropization time , @xmath5 , when the isotropy in momentum space is achieved and they should fulfill the criteria @xmath8 . in absence of anisotropy , we have @xmath9 .    in this letter",
    ", we present intensity interferometry with leptonpairs at most central lhc initial conditions at @xmath10=2.76 tev including momentum space anisotropy in pre - equilibrium qgp phase and attempt to study the effect of the anisotropy on the mass dependence of hbt radii extracted from the bose einstein correlation function , @xmath11 for two identical virtual photons which later decay into leptonpairs .",
    "we have discussed the definition and formalism of leptonpair interferometry in sec .",
    "[ sec_defn ] , the results are given in sec .",
    "[ sec_results ] and finally we have summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec_summ ] .",
    "leptonpair interferometry is based on computing the bose - einstein correlation ( bec ) function for two identical virtual photons which later decay in leptonpairs and can be defined as  @xcite ,    @xmath12    where @xmath13 and    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the three momentum of the two identical virtual photons with @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the average transverse momentum , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the four co - ordinates for position and momentum variables respectively and @xmath21 s are the angles made by @xmath22 with the x - axis of each virtual photon .",
    "@xmath23 is the source function related to the thermal emission rate of virtual photons per unit four volume .",
    "the possiblity of dilution of the signal due to random pairs will not affect the hbt radii ( disscussed in ref  @xcite ) , thus we have neglected the leptonpairs with different invariant masses . by ignoring the leptonpair with different inavarant mass , i.e , @xmath24 , we can re write @xmath11 as :    @xmath25 ^ 2 +   \\left[\\int d^{4}x ~dm^2   ~\\omega ( x , k ) \\sin(\\delta\\alpha)\\right]^2 }   { p_{1}(\\vec{k_{1 } } ) p_{1}(\\vec{k_{2 } } ) }    \\label{eq_c2_new}\\ ] ]    where @xmath26 and @xmath27 , @xmath28 the inclusion of the spin of the virtual photon will reduce the value of @xmath29 by 1/3 .",
    "the correlation functions can be evaluated by using eqs .",

    "the decays of the light vector mesons @xmath34 and @xmath2 have been considered including the continuum  @xcite . since the continuum part of the vector meson spectral functions are included , the processes like four pions annihilation  @xcite are excluded to avoid double counting .",

    "the effect of radial flow is neglected in the anisotropic phase as it is not developed in the initial stage of the collision . for @xmath6 ,",
    "the system is described by ( 1 + 2)d ideal hydrodynamics model with cylindrical symmetry  @xcite and boost invariance along the longitudinal direction  @xcite .",
    "the initial temperature ( @xmath36 ) and initial formation time ( @xmath37 ) of the system is constrained by the hadronic multiplicity ( @xmath38 ) as @xmath39 .",
    "the equation of state ( eos ) which controls the rate of expansion / cooling has been taken from the lattice qcd calculations  @xcite .",
    "the chemical ( @xmath40 ) and kinetic ( @xmath41 ) freeze - out temperatures are fixed by the particle ratios and the slope of @xmath1 spectra of hadrons  @xcite .",
    "the values of these parameters are displayed in table  [ initialconditions ] .",
    "with the initial conditions described in table  [ initialconditions ] , we evaluate the correlation function , @xmath11 for different invariant mass windows ( for @xmath420.3 , 0.5 , 0.77 , 1.02 , 1.6 and 2.5 gev ) for pb+pb collisions at @xmath43 = 2.76 tev as a function of @xmath44 and @xmath45 which are related to the transverse momentum of individual pair as follows :  @xcite ; @xmath46 where @xmath22 is the individual transverse momentum and @xmath47 is the rapidity . it may be mentioned that the bec function has values @xmath48 for a chaotic source .",
    "these bounds are from quantum statistics .",
    "these source dimensions can be obtained by parameterizing the calculated correlation function with the empirical gaussian form  @xcite ; @xmath49 where @xmath50 stands for side and out .",
    "thus @xmath51 and @xmath52 appearing in eq .",
    "[ eq_prmt ] , are commonly referred to as `` hbt radii '' , which are measures of gaussian widths of the source size .",
    "the deviation of @xmath53 from 1/3 will indicate the presence of non - thermal sources .",
    "while the radius corresponding to @xmath44 ( @xmath51 ) is closely related to the transverse size of the system .",
    "the radius corresponding to @xmath45 ( @xmath52 ) measures both the transverse size and duration of particle emission  @xcite .",
    "with @xmath30 for different values of @xmath5 .",
    "the solid line corresponds to isotropic scenario ( @xmath54 fm ) and the dotted and dashed line corresponds to @xmath5 = 2,3 fm respectively which is related to anisotropic scenario . ]    in the present work , the corresponding hbt radii are extracted with the help of the parametrization expressed in eq .",
    "[ eq_prmt ] for three different values of @xmath5 .",
    "we choose @xmath5 in such a way that @xmath55 ( 0.08 fm ) corresponds to the isotropic situation and @xmath56 ( 2 , 3 fm ) corresponds to anisotropic scenario .",
    "so basically , we have attempted to examine the sensitivity of momentum anisotropy on spatial and temporal size of the evolving system by controlling the variable , @xmath5 .",
    "again we argue that large m region ( beyond @xmath57 ) corresponds to the partonic phase as it is dominated by lepton pairs from the partonic interactions and @xmath58 region corresponds to the hadronic region as leptonpairs are produced basically from the interaction of light vector mesons .",
    "so the study of invariant mass variations of @xmath51 and @xmath52 in these two m regions characterizes the two different phases of hic  @xcite . in figure .",
    "[ fig1 ] and  [ fig2 ] we display the invariant mass dependence of @xmath51 and @xmath52 for three values of @xmath59 .",
    "@xmath11 as function of @xmath45 is calculated by taking @xmath60=0 , @xmath61=0 and fixing transverse momentum of one photon ( @xmath0 = 2 gev ) and varying the other ( @xmath62 ) for different invariant masses and the values of corresponding @xmath52 is extracted from it using the parametrization given in eq .  [ eq_prmt ] .",
    "@xmath52 probes both the transverse size and the duration of emission . with the development of radial flow , the transverse dimension of the emission zone decreases .",
    "although the effect of flow is small in the initial stage of collision which is dominant in large m region ( corresponds to larger size ) and the duration of emission is small - resulting in a small values of @xmath52 .",
    "whereas @xmath58 region suffers from larger flow effects which should have resulted in a minimum value in @xmath52 in this m region .",
    "however , @xmath52 probes the duration of emission too , which is large for hadronic phase because of the slower expansion due to softer eos used in the present work for the hadronic phase .",
    "the larger duration compensates the reduction of @xmath52 due to flow resulting in a bump in @xmath52 for @xmath63 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . again by increasing @xmath5 , the duration of particle emission shortens and results in smaller value of @xmath52 . +   +     with @xmath30 for different values of @xmath5 .",
    "the solid line corresponds to isotropic scenario ( @xmath54 fm ) and the dotted and dashed line corresponds to @xmath5 = 2,3 fm respectively which is related to anisotropic scenario . ]",
    "@xmath11 as function of @xmath44 is calculated by taking @xmath0 = @xmath64 2 gev , @xmath61=0 and fixing @xmath65=0 and varying @xmath66 for different invariant masses and the values of corresponding @xmath51 is extracted from it using the parametrization given in eq .",
    "[ eq_prmt ] . in fig  [ fig2 ]",
    "we display the variation of @xmath51 with @xmath33 for three different values of @xmath5 and observe quantitative as well as qualitative changes in magnitude .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath51 is related to the collective motion of the system through the relation : @xmath67 .",
    "in large m region , as the flow is not developed fully so the values of @xmath51 is affected only due to initial thermal energy . as @xmath5 is inversely related to the temperature , thus increasing @xmath5 results in decrease in the values of @xmath51 in large m region . in the mass region",
    "corresponds to the hadronic phase , @xmath63 , the flow is fully developed and the thermal energy is reduced . the ratio of collective to thermal energy is large in this m region and hence shows smaller @xmath51 in isotropic scenario .",
    "however , the situation is complex in presence of initial momentum space anisotropy . by increasing @xmath5 ,",
    "the flow is reduced resulting in larger values of @xmath51 in anisotropic scenario .",
    "/@xmath51 as a function of @xmath68 . ]    the hbt radii are proportional to the average size of the system  @xcite .",
    "the average size of the system is related to the hbt radii ( here @xmath52 and @xmath51 )  @xcite extracted from correlation function , @xmath11 using eq .",
    "[ eq_prmt ] .",
    "however , some of the model dependence gets canceled out by taking the ratio of @xmath52 to @xmath51 .",
    "thus the quantity , @xmath69 gives the duration of particle emission  @xcite for various domains of @xmath33 .",

    "both show a non - monotonic dependence on @xmath68 .",
    "the smaller values of both the quantities , particularly at high mass region , reflect the contributions from the early partonic phase of the system .",
    "the peak around @xmath72-meson mass reflects dominance of the contribution from the late hadronic phase in isotropic scenario .",
    "however , increasing values of @xmath5 result in shorter duration of particle emission hence both these quantities have smaller value in anisotropic scenario compared to the isotropic one .",
    "however , by increasing the values of @xmath5 we observe quantitative change in the magnitude of both of these quantities .",
    "this is because the duration of particle emission reduces as the system takes more time to become thermalized ( by increasing @xmath5 ) .",
    "hence both these quantities have smaller value in the anisotropic scenario compared to the isotropic one .     as a function of @xmath68 . ]",
    "in summary , the correlation functions for dilepton pairs have been evaluated for different values of @xmath5 and the hbt radii have been extracted from it for pb+pb collision at 2.76 tev lhc energies for different @xmath73 windows .",
    "we observe both qualitative as well as quantitative change in the variation of hbt radii with m for dilepton pairs in presence of the initial momentum anisotropy .",
    "we argue that the variation of hbt radii with m for dilepton pairs can be used as an efficient tool to follow the change of the spatial and temporal dimensions of the evolving system with time in presence of momentum space anisotropy in the initial stage of collision .",
    "the invariant mass dependence of two experimentally challenging quantities , @xmath74 and @xmath70 also show a quantitative change due to the incorporation of anisotropy in the momentum space in the initial stage of collision .",
