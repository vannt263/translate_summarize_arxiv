    "with the rapid development of advanced data acquisition technology , processing and analyzing data sampled on 3d shapes or even higher dimensional geometric objects becomes ubiquitous tasks such as those used in a 3d camera , medical imaging , protein structuring , social network analysis etc .",
    "partial differential equation ( pde ) and variational pde based methods have made great success to handle problems in signal and image processing which can be viewed as data on euclidean domains .",
    "it is natural to consider pde based methods to analyze and process signals on a general manifold and to understand geometric structures hidden in the data .",
    "besides the classical implicit method  @xcite , finite difference methods  @xcite and finite element methods  @xcite for solving differential equations on surfaces in @xmath0 , there has been increasing interests of solving pdes on general @xmath1-dimensional manifold in @xmath2 and their applications to data analysis .",
    "for instance , a diffusion geometry framework is developed to investigate the geometric structure of data based on solving laplace - beltrami ( lb ) eigenproblem using integral kernel methods  @xcite .",
    "more recently , a moving least square method and a local mesh method are considered to intrinsically solve different types of pdes on manifolds , and then applications to the geometric understanding of ground manifolds have been considered  @xcite .",
    "all the above methods of solving pdes on a general manifold @xmath3 are commonly considered @xmath4 is sampled as a set of points @xmath5 , referred as a _ point cloud _ , and discretization of differential operators or approximation of integral equations are relied on available coordinates information of @xmath6 . however , there are many applications whose input information has no point coordinates but only represents an incomplete inter - point distance @xmath7 .",
    "examples include incomplete distance information from sensor network localization  @xcite , protein structuring from nmr spectroscopy @xcite and global position from local distance configuration of cities  @xcite .",
    "a well - known distance geometry problem  @xcite is to find the global position of data based on the incomplete distance information .",
    "the objective in this paper is different from the canonical distance geometry problem .",
    "we would like to develop numerical methods for solving pdes on manifolds represented as incomplete inter - point distance .",
    "one naive way to approach this problem is first to apply a global reconstruction algorithm to obtain a point cloud representation of the input manifold , then established numerical methods for pdes on point clouds can be directly applied .",
    "however , the global coordinate reconstruction might be very time consuming as it involves with semi - positive definite programming whose problem size depends on the number of points and could be very large in practice  @xcite .    in this paper , we propose a different strategy to solve pdes on manifolds represented as incomplete inter - point distance without conducting global coordinates reconstruction .",
    "our idea is based on two intrinsic properties of differential operators on manifolds .",
    "namely , the definition of a differential operator is only point - wisely depending on local information of the manifold and is invariant under different choices of local coordinates .",
    "this motivates us to only consider to conduct point - wisely local coordinate reconstruction for the associated local neighborhood , then we can point - wisely approximate differential operators based on the reconstructed local coordinates . after that , numerical solver for differential equations can be constructed .",
    "inspired by the classical multi - dimensional scaling  @xcite , the full distance matrix is one - to - one corresponding to the gram matrix which can be further used to determine coordinates by its eigen - decomposition .",
    "more importantly , the gram matrix can be essentially viewed as an inner product matrix after certain coordinates shift .",
    "as long as the matrix size , namely the size of a given local neighborhood , is larger than the embedding dimension of the local neighborhood , then the corresponding gram matrix has to be a low - rank matrix .",
    "this suggests us to use low rank as a prior knowledge to reconstruct the gram matrix based on constraints of available distance information .",
    "adapted from the recent advances of the low - rank matrix completion theory  @xcite , we consider a nuclear norm regularized convex optimization problem to reconstruct local coordinates based on available distance information .",
    "once local coordinates can be obtained , we apply the intrinsic methods of approximating differential operators on point clouds developed in  @xcite to discretize the desired differential equation .",
    "these intrinsic methods can be used discretize different types of pdes including parabolic , elliptic and hyperbolic pdes .",
    "our method can be viewed as natural extensions of these two methods to a new data structure where no coordinate information but only partial inter - point distance information of point clouds is provided .",
    "the outline of our strategy can be as summarized as follows :    step 0 : :    for the @xmath8-th point , chose its k - nearest neighborhood    ( knn ) @xmath9 based on the given incomplete distance or    from the prior information if its available .",
    "step 1 : :    applying the matrix completion method discussed in    section  [ sec : coordinaterecon ] to construct local coordinates for knn    of the @xmath8-th point .",
    "step 2 : :    applying the mls method or the local mesh method in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ;    * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to approximate the desired differential operators at the    @xmath8-th point .",
    "this provides the @xmath8-th row of    the discretized matrix representation of the desired differential    equation .",
    "an immediate advantage of this approach is to save computation time by avoiding the global coordinate reconstruction , which can reduce the complexity quadratically to linearly scaling with the total number of points .",
    "more details about this method will be discussed in section  [ sec : solvepdes ] and will be verified in our numerical experiments .",
    "furthermore , this approach enables us to conduct geometric understanding of data without global coordinates reconstruction .",
    "examples include global pattern extraction , comparison and classification as many existing methods conducted using results of differential equations . as a byproduct of global information from pdes",
    ", we also propose a new method for reconstructing manifolds by stitching its local patches .",
    "this new method is much more efficient than the way of direct global reconstruction using matrix completion method .",
    "moreover , it can also overcome possible reconstruction failure using global matrix completion due to the coherent missing information .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : coordinaterecon ] , we propose a low - rank matrix completion model to reconstruct local coordinates and design an algorithm to solve the proposed convex optimization problem based on operator splitting and the augmented lagrangian method .",
    "after that , section  [ sec : solvepdes ] is devoted to discuss point - wisely approximate differential operators based on the intrinsic methods proposed in  @xcite .",
    "we also discuss our two model pdes , the laplace - beltrami ( lb ) eigenvalue problem and the eiknoal equation for solve geodesic distance on manifolds . as an application of global information using solutions of lb eigenvalue problem",
    ", we propose a new method for reconstructing manifolds by stitching local patches in the lb frequency space in section  [ sec : mfdstitching ] .",
    "all numerical experiments about the effectiveness of our local coordinates reconstruction model , the accuracy and robustness of the pdes solvers , and demonstration of manifold reconstruction are discussed in section  [ sec : experiments ] .",
    "finally , we conclude our work in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in this section , we first review the concept of the classical multidimensional scaling ( mds ) . inspired by the classical mds",
    ", we propose a method of reconstructing local coordinates from the given incomplete inter - point distance matrix using the matrix completion theory  @xcite . a numerical algorithm based on the augmented lagrangian",
    "is also designed to solve the proposed convex optimization problem .",
    "as we described before , our strategy is to conduct local coordinates reconstruction for the knn @xmath9 of the @xmath8-th point . for convenience ,",
    "we write @xmath10 as @xmath11 points for @xmath9 as the following model does not rely on a typical choice of @xmath9 .",
    "the classical mds is to find a configuration of a set of points @xmath10 in @xmath2 from the given distance matrix @xmath12 is specified by the square of distance . ]",
    "such that the euclidean distance matrix @xmath13 among these points is as close as possible to the given distance matrix @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "[ def : eucli ] a distance matrix @xmath15 is called euclidean if there exist some points @xmath16 such that @xmath17 .",
    "let s write @xmath18 as an @xmath19 matrix and denote the centering matrix by @xmath20 .",
    "a gram matrix @xmath21 is defined as @xmath22 , equivalently , @xmath23 .",
    "note that the euclidean distance matrix is translation invariant , thus , the centering matrix @xmath24 essentially translates the point set centering at the origin .",
    "it is well - known that @xmath14 is euclidean if and only if @xmath25 is positive semidefinite .",
    "furthermore , @xmath26 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath27 . in our case",
    ", we consider the number of points is much larger the dimension of points .",
    "this suggests the low - rank property of @xmath28 as its prior knowledge .",
    "if @xmath14 is euclidean , in other words , @xmath28 is positive semidefinite , then the eigen - decomposition of @xmath29 provides the coordinate reconstruction @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is a diagonal matrix formed by the largest @xmath32 eigenvalues of @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the corresponding eigenfunctions .",
    "different from the mds described as the above , one of the major challenges in our assumption is that only a proportion of the distance matrix @xmath14 is available .",
    "generally speaking , it is impossible to recover the whole matrix only from its small portion of information .",
    "we here assume the information @xmath14 is randomly missing .",
    "different models of semi - definite programming have been considered  @xcite in this senario . here , we consider a different model inspired by the low - rank prior information of the gram matrix and the recent advances from matrix completion theory  @xcite .",
    "in other words , we are seeking for a symmetric positive - semidefinite low - rank matrix @xmath28 satisfying @xmath35 for @xmath36 in the available portion .",
    "mathematically , let s write @xmath37 as a random portion of the index set and write @xmath38 .",
    "we further denote the available part of @xmath14 as a vector @xmath39 and define a restriction operator @xmath40 by @xmath41 with @xmath42 .",
    "our problem becomes to find a positive semidefinite matrix @xmath43 satisfying @xmath44 .",
    "it is clear that this problem is underdetermined and there are infinite many solutions , most of which are far from the ground truth of @xmath28 and thus not applicable .",
    "regularization method is most common to handle this type of situation .",
    "based on the prior knowledge of @xmath28 is a low rank matrix , we here consider the following problem to reconstruct @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath45 inspired by the matrix completion theory  @xcite , we relax the above np - hard problem by replacing @xmath46 as the nuclear norm @xmath47 .",
    "in addition , the input distance matrix is invariant under translation of the reconstructed coordinates @xmath48 .",
    "this translation ambiguity can be fixed by requiring @xmath49 .",
    "this condition is equivalent to row sum of @xmath28 is zero , which can also be obtained from the definition of the gram matrix @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , we propose the following matrix completion model : @xmath50 where @xmath51 denotes as the @xmath52-dimensional column vector with all elements constant @xmath53 . once the above gram matrix is obtained , coordinates can be reconstructed by the eigen - decomposition of @xmath28 as the method used in the classical mds described in section  [ subsec : mds ] .",
    "we would like to remark that the constraints and the restriction operator are different from the setting in  @xcite , therefore , theoretical analysis conducted in  @xcite can not be directly applied in our problem . by considering a dual basis method , we can also theoretically show the exact completion under certain coherence condition .",
    "more details about the theoretical analysis of the model will appear in  @xcite .",
    "additionally , in a related work  @xcite , the authors propose a semidefinite embedding ( sde ) model as a kernel learning method for nonlinear dimension reduction , where no random missing but only knn information of @xmath14 is considered , and the rank minimization is not considered but maximization of @xmath54 is proposed for maximizing the variance in feature space .      for convenience of developing a numerical algorithm of model , we first introduce some notations .",
    "note that the essential freedom of the linear space @xmath55 is @xmath56 , which can be viewed as @xmath57 due to a natural isomorphism @xmath58 .",
    "we denote @xmath59 and further merge the two linear constraints together by defining the following linear operator : @xmath60 and extend the vector @xmath61 as @xmath62 .",
    "note that @xmath47 is the same as @xmath63 as @xmath28 is symmetric and positive semi - definite . in summary ,",
    "the proposed model [ eqn : reconmodel_b2 ] can be written as @xmath64 the model is a semi - definite programming ( sdp ) problem .",
    "it is well - known that the sdp problem can be solved by interior - points method @xcite as a canonical choice .",
    "however , when the number of constraint is with the order @xmath65 as in , the computational time can be with the complexity @xmath66 ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , we use the augmented lagrangian method @xcite to save both the time and memory consumption .",
    "we first introduce an auxiliary variable @xmath67 to split the model to a multi - variable optimization .",
    "then , the above problem is equivalent to the following problem : @xmath68 the splitting of variable enables us to alternatingly optimize the @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "note that the model is convex , and therefore convergence can also be guaranteed  @xcite .",
    "then we introduce an augmented lagrangian of model as follows : @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are two dual variables .",
    "as the desired problem is convex , the saddle point of @xmath74 will be the solution which can be obtained by the following iterative procedure : @xmath75    the objective function in the first step is convex and differentiable . from its first order optimality condition , @xmath76 solves the following linear system : @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the adjoint operator of @xmath79 defined as follows .",
    "it is clear that for any given @xmath80 with @xmath81 , the conjugate of @xmath79 is given by @xmath82 .",
    "here we define symmetric matrices @xmath83 and @xmath84 by:@xmath85 and @xmath86 for any @xmath87 . as @xmath88 is a symmetric and positive definite matrix ,",
    "there are numerous numerical solvers to approach the solution of the above problem . here , we typically chose the conjugate gradient method to solve .    the second step of is to find the nearest point of @xmath89 in the positive semi - definite cone .",
    "its closed - form solution can be simply realized by truncating all the information in the negative eigenvalue part .",
    "more precisely , for a symmetric matrix @xmath33 with eigen - decomposition @xmath90 , such eigenvalue hard thresholding ( evht ) operator can be defined as follows : @xmath91 with this definition , the second step of can be calculated as follows : @xmath92    we summarize the above iterative method in algorithm [ alg : reconmodel_b ] . after finding an inner - product matrix by algorithm  [ alg : reconmodel_b ] , eigen - decomposition of @xmath93",
    "can ultimately reconstruct the coordinates of points @xmath10 from the incomplete distance @xmath61 .",
    "set @xmath94 .",
    "set @xmath95 .",
    "solve @xmath96 .    @xmath97 .",
    "@xmath98 .",
    "@xmath99 .",
    "let @xmath100 .    in algorithm [ alg :",
    "reconmodel_b ] , step 2 is usually time consuming because the full eigen - decomposition has time complexity @xmath101 . because ultimately the solution of @xmath28 and @xmath102 should have low rank , it is safe to only carry out the first @xmath103 eigenfunctions by setting @xmath103 is relatively big enough comparing with the rank of @xmath28 but also small in terms of the matrix size .",
    "for instance , in our later numerical experiments for 3d point clouds , we use the matlab function `` eigs '' to find the largest @xmath104 eigenvalues and truncate all the other parts if @xmath105 . in this way",
    ", the time consumption of step 2 can be apparently decreased , and numerical results suggest no difference between this simplification and calculating full eigen - decomposition .    [",
    "rk : lowrankd ] in addition , we would like to remark that the distance matrix is also a low rank matrix provided by @xmath106 due to the relationship between @xmath28 and @xmath14 satisfying @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the linear operator to project diagonal component of @xmath28 to a column vector .",
    "therefore , we can also directly reconstruct @xmath14 based on its available information .",
    "this leads to a low rank minimization model as follows : @xmath109 the above model is exactly the same as the general matrix completion theory discussed in @xcite , which also indicates that the minimum required amount of @xmath14 for successful reconstruction increases is proportion to the matrix rank . not that the rank of @xmath14 is higher than the rank of matrix @xmath28 . plus , the less flexibility of @xmath28 due to the positive semi - definite condition can also help to reduce the requirement of valid distance information for successful reconstruction .",
    "therefore , we would expect that model requires a higher rate of valid distance than the proposed model .",
    "in fact , our numerical experiments in section  [ sec : experiments ] also verify this observation .",
    "in this section , after a brief review of the moving least square ( mls ) method  @xcite and the local mesh ( lm ) method  @xcite for solving pdes on manifolds represented as point clouds , we demonstrate our proposed methods of solving an elliptic eigenvalue problem and a nonlinear hyperbolic equation on manifold represented as incomplete distance information .",
    "different from traditional implicit or triangle mesh representation of surfaces in @xmath110 , which the implicit methods  @xcite , finite difference methods and finite element methods  @xcite have been proposed to solve pdes on surfaces . however , it is not straightforward to use these methods in our case as the incomplete distance data structure has no global mesh structure and the ground manifold could be with dimension higher than 2 in a high co - dimensional ambient space .",
    "as the definitions of differential operators on manifolds are coordinate invariant , we can approximate differential operators point - wisely based on its local coordinate reconstruction obtained from the matrix completion method proposed in section  [ sec : coordinaterecon ] .",
    "namely , each given point , its reconstructed local neighborhood can be viewed as a point cloud , therefore , we apply moving least square ( msl ) method  @xcite or local mesh ( lm ) method  @xcite to approximate the differential operators . these methods can achieve high order accuracy and enjoy more flexibility .",
    "they can be applied to manifolds with arbitrary dimensions and codimensions . to make the paper self - sufficient , we briefly discuss these two methods in this section .",
    "we denote the index set of the knn of the @xmath8-th point as @xmath9 and write @xmath111 as the reconstructed euclidean coordinates of the neighborhood @xmath9 . based on @xmath112 ,",
    "its tangent space and normal space can be determined by standard principle component analysis ( pca )  @xcite , which is provided by eigensystem of the covariance matrix @xmath113 of @xmath9 defined by : @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the centroid of @xmath112 .",
    "if the intrinsic dimension of the manifold is @xmath1 , then the jump of @xmath113 s eigenvalues guides the splitting @xmath116 . here",
    "@xmath117 represents the tangent space spanned by @xmath118 corresponding to the @xmath1 largest eigenvectors of @xmath113 , and @xmath119 represents the normal space spanned by the rest of the eigenvectors of @xmath113 . as @xmath120 form orthogonal axes near the point @xmath121 , a new _ virtual coordinates _ of @xmath122",
    "can be obtained by @xmath123 .",
    "therefore , the manifold structure near @xmath121 can be approximated by a degree 2 polynomial map @xmath124 whose coefficients are given by the following moving least square problem : @xmath125 where the standard multi - index notation is used for @xmath126 and @xmath127 is a weight function whose typical choice can be @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "similarly , any function @xmath130 or vector filed @xmath131 defined @xmath112 can also be interpolated as a degree 2 polynomial @xmath132 or @xmath133 .",
    "overall , we obtain a local polynomial interpolation of @xmath112 as @xmath134 and a local polynomial interpolation of function defined on @xmath112 as @xmath132 .",
    "therefore , the metric tensor @xmath135 near @xmath121 can be otained by @xmath136 .",
    "this enables us to approximate the following three intrinsic differential operators at @xmath121 : @xmath137 where @xmath138 , @xmath139 and the einstein summation is used in the above formulas .",
    "other differential operators can also be approximated using similar method .",
    "once these differential operators can be approximated , then a finite difference type of method can be applied to solve differential equations on the given data .",
    "we refer  @xcite for more details about this approach of approximating differential operators on manifold represented as point clouds .    the local mesh method proposed in @xcite",
    "is another method to approximate the above differential operators from the virtual local coordinates .",
    "namely , at @xmath8-th point , a local connectivity can be constructed for the projection image of @xmath112 on @xmath117 through the standard delaunay triangulation .",
    "thus , this connectivity can be directly inherited on @xmath112 .",
    "if we denote the simplex of the first ring of @xmath121 by @xmath140 , the differential operators at each point can be approximated by weighted average as follows : @xmath141 moreover , a finite element type of method can be applied to estimate the mass matrix and stiffness matrix .",
    "therefore , differential equations like laplace - beltrami eigenvalues problems can be solved .",
    "we refer  @xcite for more detailed discussion about construction of mass matrix and stiffness matrix .",
    "we remark that the above constructions are conducted point - wisely . as long as a differential operator is well - defined on a manifold ,",
    "namely , its definition does not depend on the choice of local coordinate , then the above procedure can consistently approximate the desired differential operators . a different strategy can also be considered is to reconstruct coordinates first using the proposed gram matrix completion algorithm , then approximate differential operators based on the global reconstructed coordinates .",
    "we would like to point out that the proposed methods of approximating differential operators based on local reconstruction enjoys advantages of computation efficiency and memory consumption .",
    "in fact , the most time - consuming part of the coordinate reconstruction algorithm  [ alg : reconmodel_b ] is the eigenvalue hard thresholding .",
    "consider a incomplete distance data with @xmath52 nodes , the complexity of each eigenvalue thresholding step is @xmath142 for global reconstruction if only the largest @xmath103 eigenvalues are computed . in our local reconstruction strategy ,",
    "we only reconstruct coordinates of @xmath143 nearest points near @xmath121 with complexity @xmath144 . when @xmath52 is very large ( such as @xmath145 used in our experiments ) and @xmath143 is small ( @xmath146 30 in our experiments ) , the local reconstruction strategy is apparently much more efficient than global reconstruction strategy .",
    "our numerical experiments discussed in section  [ sec : experiments ] also support this point ( see table  [ tab : timelocalvsglobal ] ) .",
    "moreover , the local reconstruction method supports parallel computation which can further reduce time consumption to @xmath101 . additionally , the memory consumption of global reconstruction is @xmath147 and the matrix is not sparse , which often crashes the program due to insufficient memory for large size data .",
    "however , our local reconstruction strategy only requires the memory @xmath65 which avoids the problem of memory limit exceeding .",
    "the first pde we consider is an elliptic eigenvalue problem of the laplace - beltrami ( lb ) operator @xmath148 .",
    "the lb operator is self - adjoint and elliptic , so its spectrum is discrete .",
    "we denote the eigenvalues of @xmath149 as @xmath150 and the corresponding eigenfunctions as @xmath151 satisfying the following equations  @xcite : @xmath152 the set of lb eigenfunctions @xmath153 forms an orthonormal basis of the space of @xmath154 functions on @xmath4 .",
    "the set @xmath155 is called lb eigensystem of @xmath4 . due to the intrinsic definition of the lb operator @xmath156 , the induced lb",
    "eigensystem @xmath157 is also completely intrinsic to the manifold geometry and provides an intrinsic and systematic characterization of the underlying geometry  @xcite .",
    "recently , there have been increasing interests in using the laplace - beltrami ( lb ) eigensystem for 3d shape analysis as well as point clouds analysis  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it would be also important to consider solve the lb eigensystem for manifolds represented as incomplete inter - point distance , then all existing methods of conducting data analysis using the lb eigensystem can also be adapted to the incomplete distance data structure .",
    "our numerical solvers are based on the numerical solvers for point clouds .",
    "first , we apply the matrix completion model for point - wise local coordinate reconstruction .",
    "either mls or lm can be then applied to obtain the discretized matrix form of the equation , where the only step we need to conduct is to use the reconstructed local coordinates for the lb operator discretization as we discussed in the section  [ subsec : reviewmlslm ] . as",
    "the lb operator is invariant under different choices of the local coordinates , the rigid motion ambiguity from the local coordinate reconstruction will not introduce inconsistency across different coordinate patches , which guarantee our method can provide satisfactory numerical results as we illustrate in the numerical section .",
    "we would like to remark that it is relatively straightforward to have the local consistency of the differential operator as long as the available distance information satisfying certain incoherence condition as we discussed in our theoretical validation work  @xcite .",
    "however , the stability of the discretization is hard to obtain , which will be considered in our future work .",
    "the second equation we consider is the eikonal equation , a special type of nonlinear hyperbolic pde , on manifold which is used to characterize the geodesic distance , an intrinsic measurement between two points on manifold .",
    "the eikonal equation for the distance map @xmath1 to a given set @xmath158 on a manifold @xmath4 can be stated as follows : @xmath159 when @xmath158 only includes a single point @xmath32 , the distance map can be denoted as @xmath160 . in practice , provided points coordinates and mesh structure , model can be solved by fast marching and fast sweeping methods @xcite . for manifolds represented as point clouds ,",
    "a local mesh method based on fast marching is proposed in  @xcite .",
    "as long as the local coordinate reconstruction is obtained using the proposed matrix completion model , then a local delaunay mesh structure can be constructed .",
    "after that , we repeat the local mesh method to conduct the fast marching as this approach only depends on the distance information of the first ring structure of the local mesh , which is again rigid motion invariant and will not be affected due to the rigid motion ambiguity from the local coordinate reconstruction .",
    "as we mentioned before , solutions of differential equations on manifolds can provide global information for understanding data structure .",
    "thus , pdes can be viewed as  bridges \" linking between local information and global information .",
    "this shares the same sprit as  think globally , fit locally \" discussed in  @xcite although no pdes are involved . therefore , without global reconstruction , some global analysis of point clouds such as pattern recognition , comparisons and classification can be further considered for data represented as incomplete distance . in this section",
    ", we illustrate results on applications of manifold reconstruction and dimension reduction based on solutions of the laplace - beltrami eigenvalue problem on incomplete distance data .",
    "the patch stitching problem is to reconstruct the coordinate of a point cloud @xmath161 from coordinates of @xmath162 subsets ( referred as patches ) @xmath163 , where @xmath164 denotes the index set for patch @xmath165 . in practice , for each patch @xmath164 , the local coordinates @xmath166 , which are provided as input information or are reconstructed from distance information , have the same pair - wise distance and geometry as the restricted global coordinate @xmath167 with possible rigid motion difference . in other words , @xmath168 , where @xmath169 is an orthogonal matrix for rotation and reflection",
    ", @xmath170 is a vector with all element equal to 1 , and @xmath171 is the translation vector .",
    "a straightforward approach to solve @xmath172 and @xmath173 is to minimize the quadratic loss : @xmath174 such model is a non - convex problem since @xmath172 are required to optimize over the non - convex domain of orthogonal transforms . in @xcite , the authors proposed a three - stage patch stitching method from the local coordinate by synchronizing the reflection , rotation and translation successively .",
    "however , the quality of synchronization is strongly relies on the proportion of the overlapping index .",
    "more recently , a spectral relaxation method is proposed to solve the above problem in @xcite .",
    "this method essentially relax the set of orthogonality constraints and perform well if neighborhood patches has reasonable enough overlapping points .    here",
    ", we propose an alternative method to reconstruct the global coordinate from local coordinate , or merely incomplete distance information of each patch .",
    "based on solution of lb eigen - problem incomplete distance information discussed in section [ subsec : solvepde ] , we consider the lb eigen - system as a `` bridge '' to connect the information of different patches .",
    "this idea of this new method is essentially align each local patch in the spectral domain instead of the original euclidean coordinate domain . as the global information has been captured from the lb eigen - system ,",
    "the overlapping of different patches is not directly required here .",
