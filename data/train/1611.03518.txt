    "in surface stabilized ferroelectric liquid crystal [ ssflc ] cells smectic layers usually deform into a characteristic chevron pattern [ 1 , 2 ] . the chevron structure ( see fig . [",
    "fig : chevron ] ) is believed to arise due to the mismatch between the natural smectic layer thickness and the periodicity imposed by the layer pinning at the surface in the smectic - a phase , where this surface memory effect has been confirmed experimentally [ 3 ] . in the past",
    ", several theoretical models have been presented to describe the director and layer structure in smectic - c chevron cells .",
    "this work has been motivated by a potential use of [ ssflc ] cells in display devices .",
    "the original model was put forward by clark and co - workers [ 1 , 4 ] .",
    "theirs is a macroscopic description where the molecular alignment varies slowly across each chevron arm , restricted so that the molecules lie on the arm s smectic - c cone .",
    "the chevron tip is idealized to have zero thickness ; the smectic layers form a sharp bend at the tip so that their normal is discontinuous there .",
    "a key assumption in their model is the continuity of the equilibrium director pattern across the cell . assuming the cone angle is larger than the layer tilt , these conditions lead to two out - of - plane states determined by the intersection of the cones from each side of the tip .",
    "this means that chevron cells exhibit two stable director states between which the cell can be switched by the application of an external electric field .",
    "an important reason to model surface stabilized cells is to describe the switching dynamics between these stable director states .",
    "the model of clark et al . has been extended to include continuity of the biaxial ordering at the chevron tip [ 5 ] .",
    "the development of models to describe ferroelectric switching has a number of difficulties .",
    "these are largely due to the contrasting length scales associated with the chevron arms and tip .",
    "the macroscopic models such as the one described above require that the director at the chevron tip leaves the cones from the adjacent arms during the switching process .",
    "the models account for this by allowing the director to be discontinuous at the tip during the transition and an ad hoc energy barrier is included in the free energy penalizing the director s jump across the tip .",
    "( see maclennan et al .",
    "[ 6 , 7 ] , ulrich and elston [ 8 ] , and brown et al .",
    "[ 9 ] ) .",
    "a number of models of the chevron structure have been reported which take into account continuous layer bending at the chevron tip and the director rotation on the cone [ 10 - 15 ] .",
    "these models however , enforce specific couplings between the molecular cone angle from the smectic layer tilt angle that permit a continuous pattern near the tip but are also ad hoc .    in this paper",
    "we use a chen - lubensky model to characterize the director and layer structure of surface stabilized smectic - c cells in an external electric field .",
    "this approach has been developed in the papers kralj and sluckin [ 16 ] , vaupotic et al .",
    "[ 17 , 18 ] , hazelwood and sluckin [ 19 ] , and cheng and phillips [ 20 ] .",
    "we build on these works here .",
    "the advantage of this phenomenological model over others is that the formation of chevrons and the nature of the director pattern near the chevron tip follow from energetic considerations as opposed to features that are directly inserted into the model . in [ 20 ] , the smectic layer thickness is introduced as a small parameter and the static model of clark et al .",
    "described above is captured as a singular limit having smectic layers with a sharp chevron tip and its two out - of - plane equilibrium director patterns . in this work",
    "we consider a more complete chen - lubensky model that allows the smectic layers to melt near the chevron tip under the application of a finite electric field allowing for the switching from one state , tending to the other assuming gradient flow dynamics .",
    "our contribution here is that we establish existence and uniqueness results for the gradient flow problem .",
    "many open questions for this model remain to be explored .",
    "for example once the switching occurs the model allows the smectic layers to reform near the chevron tip .",
    "just how robust this regeneration is remains an open question .",
    "this is an important point since the studies of willis et al .",
    "[ 21 ] showed that there should be no significant change in smectic layer thickness or chevron layer structure under typical director switching conditions .",
    "we consider a cross section of an ssflc cell of width @xmath1 and place the origin of the axes at the midpoint of the lower cell aperture .",
    "the domain is then written as @xmath2 .    to model a smectic phase , we need two types of ordering , orientational and positional .",
    "the former is described by a unit vector @xmath3 that indicates the average local orientation of the rod - shaped molecules , called the nematic director field .",
    "the latter is described by a complex - valued order parameter , @xmath4 , whose amplitude indicates the degree of smectic ordering and whose phase indicates the position of the smectic layer . if @xmath5 , then the phase is completely nematic . for a smectic phase , @xmath6 , with @xmath7 for well - structured smectic layers .",
    "an essential parameter in our analysis is the wave number @xmath8 , which equals @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the layer thickness in the bulk smectic - c phase . in a realistic model",
    ", @xmath10 is very small ( typically @xmath11 is in the range @xmath12 [ 17 ] ) , so one eventually would like to study the limiting problem letting @xmath13 . for the present work , @xmath8 is assumed to be a large number .",
    "let @xmath14 denote the layer thickness at the surface .",
    "this is a spacing inherited from the material initially being cooled from the smectic - a phase .",
    "we use the parameter @xmath15 to measure the mismatch between the different layer thicknesses .",
    "lastly , let @xmath16 denote the bulk tilt angle of the molecules from the layer normal in the smectic - c phase .",
    "we base our model on a covariant form of the landau - de gennes free energy , introduced by chen & lubensky [ 22 ] .",
    "the density for our free energy @xmath17 consists of three parts , nematic , smectic and electrostatic    @xmath18    the nematic density , @xmath19 , measures the uniformity of @xmath3 and we take it to be the one - constant approximation of the oseen - frank energy density , @xmath20 where @xmath21 . the smectic part , @xmath22 , measures the uniformity of the layer structure and is a variation of the chen - lubensky energy density .",
    "we split this energy density into two components , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the first component is the elastic energy density , @xmath25 the second component we call the smectic penalization density , @xmath26 @xmath27 is the covariant derivative , @xmath28 with its parallel component ( to @xmath3 ) @xmath29 and perpendicular component ( to @xmath3 ) @xmath30 .",
    "the parameter constants @xmath31 are positive and determined by the material .",
    "lastly , we write the electrostatic part , @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the spontaneous polarization field and @xmath34 is the applied electric field directed across the cell .    due to the periodicity of @xmath4 , we are able to reduce our model to be one - dimensional . specifically , we write @xmath35 where @xmath36 is complex - valued .",
    "expressing periodicity in this form was used by kralj and sluckin [ 16 ] , wherein to enforce the smectic density wave in the @xmath37 direction , @xmath4 was written in the form @xmath38}{\\sqrt{1+b^2}}}$ ] such that @xmath39 was assumed to be a constant and @xmath40 is the graph of a uniformly smectic layer in their setting .",
    "the same idea was also used in [ 20 ] .",
    "our approach , however , is different in that it aims to explain the whole process through the model without invoking any ad hoc energy terms added later .",
    "particularly , we want the system to allow for phase changes in certain areas if that is less costly in an energetic sense ( by melting , for instance ) .",
    "the tool to do that is to keep the complex - valued order parameter in a general form , allowing @xmath36 to vanish .",
    "we consider the admissible set @xmath41 where @xmath42 such that @xmath43 the boundary conditions enforce uniform smectic layers at the cell surfaces and for simplicity there are no boundary conditions on the director .",
    "we rewrite the smectic energy by integrating by parts and taking into account the boundary conditions to get an integrand that is bounded below .",
    "we then carry out the dimension reduction with our variable denoted by @xmath44 rather than @xmath45 . within the above admissible set , our total free energy ( per unit length with respect to @xmath37 ) becomes    ( , ) = & _ -l^l \\{|-[(n_1+n_2)n_2]-+n_1 ^ 2 . & + & -n_1n_2+|^2 & + & + |(-)(-n_1 + in_2+q ) & + & [ energy]+[(n_1+n_2-i)n_2]|^2 & + & + qc_|n_1 + n_2 -i|^2 & + & + g(||^2 - 1)^2+(||^2)^2+(||^2)^2+(||^2)^2+||^2 & + & .+k [ n_1^2+n_2^2+n_3^2]+ ||^2n_3}dx &    we have added a regularizing factor @xmath46 , with @xmath47 a small positive constant , to aid with the analysis .",
