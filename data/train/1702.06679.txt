    "while the semileptonic decay @xmath4 mediated by the flavor - changing neutral current ( fcnc ) transition @xmath5 has received a lot of attention as a sensitive probe of new physics ( np ) beyond the standard model ( sm ) , much less light has been shed on the analogous process @xmath6 ; either the exclusive channels @xmath7 or the semi - inclusive one @xmath8 .",
    "there are three main reasons for this .",
    "first , the decay is yet to be observed ; there is only an upper limit to the branching ratio ( br ) of such processes @xcite .",
    "this is not unexpected considering that the experimental sensitivity is about one order of magnitude above the sm predictions .",
    "second , the number of observables are less than the processes involving charged leptons , because the neutrinos escape undetected .",
    "third , the theoretical uncertainties like those coming from the form factors are more serious than relatively cleaner channels like @xmath9",
    ".    one can pose counter - arguments too .",
    "for example , the belle upgrade with a much enhanced integrated luminosity ( or any other future @xmath10 @xmath3 factory ) will almost definitely observe this process even if there is no np involved .",
    "the limited number of observables can actually make the analysis cleaner .",
    "as we will show quantitatively , one can successfully use these few observables not only to differentiate some well - motivated np models from the sm but also to have a glimpse of the possible operator structure of those models .",
    "this remains true even when one takes into account all the theoretical uncertainties like the form factors , elements of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix , the running quark masses , or the higher - order corrections .",
    "the conception that whatever may be inferred from the neutrino channels can also be inferred in a much cleaner way involving charged lepton final states , because of the @xmath11 conjugate nature of the corresponding operators , is also not entirely correct .",
    "consider , for example , an @xmath11 singlet current of the form @xmath12 , involving both quark and lepton doublets . that couples to a vector leptoquark .",
    "the charged lepton final states , obviously , come only from the anomalous top decays and not from @xmath3 decays .",
    "thus , the neutrino channels are worthy to be studied on their own right . there may be other light invisible particles in the final state ( we will show an example later ) which have nothing to do with charged leptons .",
    "as neutrinos or other such invisibles go undetected , this channel offers an effective probe for such models .",
    "thus , one must treat the decay channel @xmath2  invisible(s ) as an independent source of information from @xmath1 , although there can be correlations in some beyond - sm models .    as an example of what we have just said , let us note that apart from neutrinos coming from non - sm operators , the fcnc transition @xmath5 can involve light invisible scalars in the final state .",
    "if they are singlet under all the sm gauge groups , they can very well be a candidate for cold dark matter ( dm ) .",
    "although there are strong constraints on such light dm particles from the direct detection experiments like lux , xenon or pandax @xcite , one may avoid them if the dm is nonthermal in origin .",
    "the only limit comes from the invisible decay width of the higgs boson at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , which one can easily keep within the tolerable limit of @xmath13 if the higgs - dm coupling is small .",
    "thus , an analysis of the decay @xmath2 invisibles will also act as a complementary probe to the dm direct search .",
    "we will use the optimal observable ( oo ) technique for the analysis .",
    "the oo technique helps one to identify observables where the np can be differentiated from the sm with highest confidence level .",
    "of course , which observables are to be used depends on which part of the parameter space the np falls .",
    "while this technique has been more widely used for collider studies @xcite , ref .",
    "@xcite shows how this can be applied to semileptonic @xmath3 decays as well .",
    "note that in the absence of any data , one must work only with statistical uncertainties .",
    "the systematic uncertainties will somewhat relax the reaches and the confidence levels .",
    "the oo technique not only shows the regions of the parameter space for np where differentiation from the sm will be easy but also the variables that one should look at to have such a successful differentiation . in other words ,",
    "a simultaneous study of all the relevant observables can effectively pin down the region of the parameter space where any beyond - sm physics may lie . in the next section",
    ", we will provide a sketchy discussion of the oo technique . in section iii",
    ", we discuss two most popular np models ; one with neutrinos in the final state but the effective operator basis augmented by some np operators ; and the second with light scalars in the final state along with sm neutrinos .",
    "sections iv and v discuss our results for these two models respectively .",
    "we summarize and conclude in section vi .",
    "this section is rather sketchy and follows the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite suppose there is an observable @xmath14 which depends on the variable @xmath15 as o ( ) = _ i c_i f_i ( ) , where @xmath16s are model - dependent coefficients , like the wilson coefficients ( wc ) , and @xmath17 are known functions of @xmath15 . for our case , @xmath15 can be identified with the momentum transfer ( to the invisible particles ) squared , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 denotes the four - momentum of the particle @xmath20 . to get @xmath16 , one can fold with weighting functions @xmath21 such that w_i ( ) o ( ) d= c_i .",
    "there happens to be a unique choice of @xmath21 such that the statistical error in @xmath16s are minimized . for this choice , the covariance matrix @xmath22 , defined as v_ij w_i ( ) w_j ( ) o ( ) d is at a stationary point with respect to the variation of @xmath15 : @xmath23",
    "this happens if we choose w_i ( ) = , where x_ij = ( m^-1)_ij ,   m_ij = d. [ mijdef ] in this case , c_i = _ j",
    "x_ij i_j = _ j ( m^-1)_ij i_j ,   i_j = f_j ( ) d.    for only this choice of weighting functions , the covariance matrix is v_ij = c_i c_j= , [ vijdef ] where @xmath24 .",
    "( if @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    ") @xmath27 is the total number of events , given by the integrated cross - section times total luminosity times the efficiencies .",
    "this result holds even if there are applied cuts .",
    "the minimum of statistical uncertainty in the extraction of a parameter gives the maximum significance of that parameter over the others .",
    "therefore , using this technique we can test the significance of a specific np model over the other models , including the sm .",
    "in other words , given the data , one can say with what significance some observable may differentiate a particular type of np from the sm .",
    "this significance , as one should emphasize here , depends on the observable chosen , on the parameters of the np model , and on the integrated luminosity , all of which are intuitively obvious .    as an example , suppose one is looking at the branching fractions of a @xmath3 meson to several final states .",
    "for the final state @xmath28 , the branching fraction can be expressed as ( bf)^exp = dq^2 , where @xmath29 is the total decay width .",
    "the statistical uncertainties in @xmath16s extracted from the branching fractions can be written as @xcite |c_i| = = .",
    "[ eq5 ] as given in eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) , the errors are also related to the total production cross section @xmath30 ( = @xmath31 ) , and the effective luminosity @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the integrated luminosity and reconstruction efficiency respectively .",
    "when the number of nonzero np parameters is small , the analysis can also be done by defining a quantity analogous to @xmath35 , such as @xmath36 the @xmath37s are called the seed values , which can be considered as model inputs .",
    "thus , they are the values of @xmath16s with the parameter values chosen for the reference model .",
    "@xmath38s are defined in eq .",
    "( [ vijdef ] ) .",
    "as mentioned earlier , our goal is to study the decay @xmath2 invisible(s ) , which includes the exclusive modes like @xmath39 . in such decays ,",
    "the major sources of uncertainties are the hadronic form - factors , like @xmath40 .",
    "thus , it is important to differentiate between sm and any possible np taking into account all these uncertainties , and check whether the future experimental statistics will allow a clear separation of the two .",
    "let us now explain briefly how to use a @xmath35 statistic test to pinpoint such a differentiation .",
    "there are a few things one should take note of while interpreting the results of the oo technique .",
    "\\(1 ) a regular @xmath35 statistic is a function of parameters of a model and ` measures ' the deviation of those from observed values of some experimental quantities .",
    "the one we need to concoct , however , should take one specific model ( _ e.g. _ sm ) as reference , in place of experimental results , and should be a function of some parameters , each set of values of which indicates one comparison - worthy model ( e.g. np ) .",
    "for example , if we have a set of new operators @xmath41 with @xmath16 being the corresponding wcs , @xmath42 is the sm and any other set is a np model that may be compared with the sm .",
    "the @xmath35 should also be a measure of ` separation ' ( deviation ) between any np model and the reference one . in the rest of this analysis",
    ", the reference - model will always be sm . by construction",
    ", we ensure that @xmath43 and @xmath44 denotes a separation of @xmath45 from the sm .",
    "\\(2 ) projections of the constant @xmath46 contours on each parameter axis will give us the corresponding @xmath47s .",
    "following the point above , the constructed @xmath35 has no measurements or data points in it and thus the @xmath47s obtained are not statistical uncertainties on the @xmath16s ; it is not even the predictions for them . these are uncertainties of the reference model , or , in other words , a measure of the region in parameter space where the reference model is indistinguishable from models parametrized by surrounding points in the parameter space .",
    "thus , points on the @xmath48 contour parametrize models that can be distinguished from the sm at @xmath48 level only .",
    "\\(3 ) when varying the @xmath35 over the allowed parameter space , @xmath49 also depends on the parameter values through @xmath50 , which comes in the denominator of @xmath51 ( eq .  ( [ mijdef ] ) ) .",
    "this is known as the seed dependence .",
    "\\(4 ) the covariance matrix @xmath52 as well as the @xmath35 are obtained using the central values of all the parameters .",
    "so any separation obtained after the analysis , though qualitatively correct , has to be modified after inclusion of the sm errors .",
    "\\(5 ) if considered , theoretical uncertainties in @xmath50 will in turn introduce an uncertainty in the @xmath35 .",
    "in other words , in presence of the uncertainties , the @xmath45 contours will become bands of nonzero width in the parametric space .    for completeness",
    ", we will also provide the decay rate distributions of the processes under consideration , and test their usefulness in differentiating the np models from the sm .",
    "the first np model treats neutrinos as the only carrier of missing energy in @xmath5 decays .",
    "we will also take , for simplicity , not only no lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) but also lepton flavor universality ( lfu ) .",
    "this means all the three flavors of @xmath53 pairs are produced in equal number even by the np operators , and there are no @xmath54 final states with @xmath55 .",
    "note that both these assumptions can be violated in specific np models .",
    "the effective hamiltonian for @xmath56 can be written as _ eff = v_tb v^*_ts , [ h - eff ] where o_sm = o_v_1 & = & ( |s_l ^b_l)(|_il__il ) , + o_v_2 & = & ( |s_r ^b_r)(|_il__il ) .",
    "[ ops ] note that @xmath57 and @xmath58 are identical only with our assumption of lfu and no lfv .",
    "np with lfu can mean , in an extreme case , that only one flavor of neutrino will be present ; with lfv , the two neutrinos can be of different flavor .",
    "similar considerations apply for @xmath59 . under our simplifying assumptions , one can write eq .",
    "( [ h - eff ] ) as _ eff = v_tb v^*_tsc_sm in terms of the scaled wilson coefficients defined as @xmath60 , with c_sm = x_t(x_t ) .",

    "depending on the data , different observables will have different power to differentiate np effects from the sm .",

    "[ fig : drbsss1.8 ] .",
    "we note that though @xmath166 is much higher for this case , the nature of the @xmath119 distributions , and therefore the np sensitivities , is similar to that obtained for the ls case .    as is defined in eq .",
    "[ flmod ] , the decay @xmath152 has another observable , namely , the longitudinal polarization @xmath167 .",
    "this is because the @xmath82 mesons appearing with scalars are completely longitudinally polarized .",

    "we consider two np models : ( 1 ) only neutrinos as the carrier of missing energy but with a new operator involving right - handed quark current ; and ( 2 ) apart from the sm neutrinos , light invisible scalars as the carrier of missing energy .",
    "the analysis takes into account all the new effective operators and their effects on several observables , namely , the total decay width for inclusive and exclusive modes , the differential decay distributions , and the modified transverse and longitudinal polarization fractions as defined in the text .",
    "we show our results both for the high- and low - luminosity options of belle - ii , namely , @xmath147 ab@xmath109 and @xmath169 ab@xmath109 respectively .",
    "all the observables are sensitive to np effects , and even small np effects might be detectable at future high - luminosity belle - ii .",
    "the differentiation of the np from the sm is obviously not that trivial for the low - luminosity option , apart from the observables like inclusive branching fractions .",
    "the np sensitivities of @xmath136 for exclusive and inclusive channels are different .",
    "as the data on that will possibly come after the branching fraction data , they will serve as an additional check on the operator structure and parameter values of the np .",
    "note that the exclusive distributions are more or less similar for both the np models , but the inclusive distributions are different , so that may serve as a good discriminator .",
