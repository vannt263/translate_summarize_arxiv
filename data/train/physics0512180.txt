    "in contrast , at @xmath68 and @xmath67 ( case  r7e4 ) , the convection pattern comes to have the degree - one pattern ; the one cell structure that consists of a pair of cylindrical downwelling plume and cylindrical upwelling plume ( figure  4c ) .",
    "this indicates that the convecting structure in the sluggish - lid regime is sensible to the rayleigh number .",
    "the convective flow pattern that belongs to the stagnant - lid regime emerges when @xmath69 .",
    "the stagnant - lid prevents the heat flux through the top boundary and leads to a small temperature difference in the mantle below the lid .",
    "the characteristic horizontal thermal structure has short wavelengths comparable to the thickness of the mantle ( figures  4d and 4e ) .",
    "this convective pattern in the stagnant - lid regime is also observed in the previous results in a 3-d spherical shell geometry [ e.g. , _ reese et al .",
    "_ , 1999b ] .",
    "this convective feature would be caused by the secondary downwelling plumes leaving from the base of stagnant - lid . at @xmath70 ( cases  r7e6 ) , the connected network of sheet - like downwelling reaches to the mid depth of convecting layer ( figure 4d ) .",
    "when @xmath64 is further increased to @xmath71 ( cases  r7e8 and r7ea ) , the stagnant - lid become rather thick , and we clearly observe large , mushroom - shaped upwelling plumes ( figure  4e ) .      to investigate the transition in the convective pattern by adding the depth - dependent viscosity ( a viscosity stratification ) , we investigate two kinds of viscosity profiles . first we examine cases in which the viscosity jumps at the phase transition boundary between the upper and lower mantle .",

    "figure  5a shows a snapshot of the residual temperature of case  r7e6v1 with @xmath81 .",
    "compared with the convection in which the viscosity depends only on the temperature ( figure  2b ) , we find that the convective flow pattern obviously has longer length scale .",

    "as the amount of the viscosity jump @xmath84 increases , the temperature drop in the bottom thermal boundary layer grows , which leads to the lower internal temperature of the mantle ( figure  6 ) .    to see this spatial scale change of the convection caused by the depth - dependent viscosity in more detail",
    ", we analyzed the time sequence of the nusselt number , the root - mean - square velocity averaged over the entire mantle , and the peak mode at each depth for the case  r7e6v3 with @xmath89 . at the initial stage of the simulation run ,",
    "the convection is dominated by @xmath90@xmath91 modes throughout the depth which reflects the initial condition ( figure  2b ) .",
    "as time goes on , the convective flow reaches to a saturated state ( figure  7a ) , and the low - degree component develops from the upper part to middle part of mantle ; the peak mode shifts from @xmath92 to @xmath88 there ( figure  7b ) .",
    "this indicates that the stagnant - lid is broken , and then , the convection cells are re - organized into the convection state with the low modes .    to compare with the observation , we have calculated the geoid anomaly for cases  r7e6v1 to r7e6v3 .",
    "we followed the method of the calculation of the geoid anomaly described in _ hager and clayton _ [ 1989 ] .",
    "the physical parameters used in the calculation are set to those possibly relevant to venus ( table 2 ) .",
    "figure  8 shows the distribution of calculated geoid anomaly where @xmath93 is ( a ) 1 ( i.e. , no viscosity stratification ) , ( b ) @xmath73 , ( c ) @xmath94 , and ( d ) @xmath77 .",
    "the results are shown by the spherical harmonics modes up to @xmath95 .",
    "figure  8e shows the power spectrum for each case . the mode amplitude with the viscosity stratification peaks at @xmath82@xmath86 .",
    "when the stratified viscosity is absent ( figure  8a ) , @xmath96@xmath57 modes are strong ( see the arrow in figure  8e ) . on the other hand , as @xmath93 increases ( figures  8c and 8d ) , the power spectrum peaks at @xmath82 and the higher degree components ( @xmath97 ) are remarkably decreased .",
    "this is consistent with the spectrum constructed from the observed geoid anomaly of the venus [ _ konopliv et al .",
    "_ , 1999 ] ( figure  8e ) .",
    "next , we investigate the cases with smoothly increased viscosity with depth rather than the jump . in three cases",
    "( cases  r7e6w1 , r7e6w2 , and r7e6w3 ) shown in figure  9 , the viscosity contrast between the upper / lower mantle boundary and the bottom of mantle is @xmath98 ( a ) @xmath73 , ( b ) @xmath99 , and ( c ) @xmath77 .",
    "the initial condition is again the state shown in figure  2b .",
    "we see from both the residual temperature and the spectrum that the dominant power is concentrated on the smaller degrees in all the cases . at @xmath100@xmath99 ,",
    "the peak is located at @xmath3 , or one - cell convection ( figures  9a and 9b ) . on the other hand , at @xmath101 ,",
    "the peak is located at @xmath82 , or the two - cell convection ( figure  9c ) .",
    "the horizontally averaged temperature and viscosity profile is shown in figure  10 .",
    "note that the viscosity contrast in the lid are almost identical among the three cases ( see the arrow in the right panel of figure  10 ) .",
    "this suggests that the transition between degree - one and degree - two convection is sensitive to the magnitude of the viscosity stratification .",
    "we found that the patterns ( degree - one or degree - two ) are not affected by the increase of @xmath40 up to 8 ( case  r7e8w2 ) or to 10 ( case  r7eaw2 ) .",
    "this pattern is also unchanged when the internal heating is included ( @xmath102 ) ( case  r7e6w2h ) , or the rayleigh number is increased to 10@xmath103 ( case  r8e6w2 ) .",
    "the patterns @xmath3 or @xmath104 are mainly controlled by the viscosity contrast @xmath105 .",
    "the convection with strongly temperature dependent viscosity under the stress - free boundary condition has short wavelength structure when the depth - dependent viscosity is ignored .",
    "this feature is inconsistent with the convection inferred from the geodesic observations on the single - plate planets like venus and mars .",
    "we have found that the combination of temperature- and depth - dependent viscosity produces the convection with the spherical harmonics degree @xmath3@xmath86 .",
    "the geoid anomaly calculated from these simulation data also generates large scale length , which is consistent with the observation .",
    "_ schubert et al . _ [ 1990 ; 1997 ] have shown that convections with rigid boundary condition on the top surface can lead to @xmath3@xmath88 structures . in their model , however , the viscosity of fluid is spatially constant .",
    "our finding is that , by considering more realistic viscosity profiles , the low - degree pattern can be reproduced in the convection model with stress - free boundary condition on the top surface .",
    "the previous convection models without the temperature - dependent viscosity [ e.g. , _ hansen et al . _ , 1993 ; _ zhang and yuen _ , 1995 ; _ bunge et al .",
    "_ , 1996 ] have already produced the large scale flow pattern by considering the viscosity stratification .",
    "this could be explained by the enhanced value of viscosity in the lower mantle . in our model with strongly temperature - dependent viscosity , the large scale convection seems to be realized by the change of convecting regime , from the stagnant - lid regime into the sluggish - lid regime , which is caused by the viscosity stratification .",
    "a major difference between their results and ours is that a highly viscous lid is naturally formed on the top owing to the inclusion of the temperature - dependent viscosity effect in this study .    to date",
    ", several mechanisms have been proposed for the degree - one convection of the martian mantle .",
    "for example , the endothermic phase transition just above core - mantle boundary in martian mantle with the rigid boundary condition [ _ harder and christensen _",
    ", 1996 ; _ breuer et al . _ , 1998 ; _ harder _ , 1998 ] , and a priori high - viscous lid [ _ harder _ , 2000 ] on the top surface boundary without any phase transitions .",
    "the small core , in other words , the thicker convecting shells of the mantle may lead to the degree - one convection in the ancient mars [ _ schubert et al . _ ,",
    "1990 ] and the moon [ _ zhong et al .",
    "_ , 2000a ] .",
    "_ mcnamara and zhong _ [ 2005a ] have recently found that the internal heating plays a role in increasing flow wavelength and forming the degree - one convection in convections in which the viscosity moderately depends on temperature .",
    "one of our findings in this paper is that the degree - one convection can be relatively easily reproduced when both effects of the temperature- and depth - dependence on the viscosity are taken into account .",
    "although the degree - one convection appears even when the depth - dependence is absent ( figure  4c ) , the parameter range for this pattern is rather narrow ; it is sensitive to the rayleigh number . on the other hand , when the viscosity in the lower mantle is continuously increased with depth , the degree - one ( @xmath3 ) convection like the martian mantle",
    "is realized in the wide range of viscosity contrast from 30 to 100 .",
    "it is an interesting possibility that the transition of the convecting patterns between low - degree convective mode and one - degree mode took place in the planets .",
    "we have not directly observed the transition of convecting mode in our simulations .",
    "the physical parameters ( @xmath20 and/or @xmath40 in this study ) to characterize the convective pattern are fixed in our simulations .",
    "however , we would like to point out again a drastic difference of the convection patterns between relatively close conditions : the convection of degree - two at @xmath106 ( figure  4b ) [ _ yoshida and kageyama _ , 2004 ] , and the convection of degree - one at @xmath107 ( figure  4c ) .",
    "this sensitive change has not been reported so far .",
    "our simulation results will not be directly applied to the earth s mantle , because the effects of the plate tectonics would be comparable to the effects of the depth - dependent viscosity , as proposed by _ bunge and richards _ [ 1996 ] and _ bunge et al . _ [ 1996 ; 1998 ] from their model without temperature - dependent viscosity .",

    "<S> it is found that the combination of the strongly temperature- and depth - dependent viscosity causes long - wavelength structures of convection in which the spherical harmonic degree @xmath2 is dominant at 14 . </S>",
