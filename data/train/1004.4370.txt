    "a density operator @xmath5 representable as a convex combination @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the set of all pure product states , is said to be separable .",
    "such description of the set of separable density operators is not constructive as their appropriate representation is _ not unique_. in this paper a uniform representation of separable density operators @xmath5 in the form @xmath8 is suggested .",
    "this representations turns out to be _",
    "unique _ , therefore , it can be treated as coordinatization of the set of separable density operators . along these lines , a criterion to determine the separability of a given density operator @xmath5 is formulated .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ shusimi ]",
    "separable density operators are treated as barycenters of _ continuously _ distributed unit masses on the set @xmath7 of pure product states .",

    "the range turns out to be the interior of the set of separable density operators , and the coordinatization is proved to be a diffeomorphism .",

    "since @xmath7 is the set of extreme points of the set of all separable density operators , choquet theorem makes it possible to write down any such @xmath5 as an integral @xmath11 over certain probability measure @xmath12 on @xmath7 . in other words , we may represent @xmath5 as the _ barycenter _ of certain distribution of unit mass on the set @xmath7 .",
