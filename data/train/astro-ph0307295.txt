    "the infrared sky surveys 2mass , sdss , and denis @xcite yielded a bountiful harvest of very cool low - luminosity dwarf stars , which prompted the extension of the conventional spectral classification sequence to @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xcite . an effort is underway to determine parallaxes for as many @xmath4- and @xmath5-dwarfs as possible .",
    "this is difficult , since these objects can be faint in the optical band where most parallax programs operate .",
    "a modest number of precise parallaxes have been secured in the optical @xcite and with infrared array detectors @xcite , but more parallaxes are needed .",
    "we describe here the chance discovery of a nearby l dwarf , as a field star in a parallax sequence aimed at a different object . because of",
    "its unusual mode of discovery , the object was ` born ' with a parallax .",
    "one of us ( jrt ) is measuring parallaxes for a sample of cataclysmic binaries using the 2.4 m hiltner telescope at mdm observatory on kitt peak , arizona .",
    "technical details of this program will be given elsewhere ; a brief summary follows .",
    "a site ccd is used with a kron - cousins @xmath6-band filter to image an 8-arcminute square field at a scale of 275 mas per pixel . at each epoch a dozen or so short exposures ( 25 s for the field considered here )",
    "are taken to avoid saturating program or comparison stars and to average out the random centering errors .",
    "image centers are measured using the iraf implementation of daophot @xcite .",
    "a large number of stars are measured , not only to constrain the plate solution adequately but also to empirically estimate the scatter in the resulting parallaxes .",
    "the scale and orientation of each field is derived from fits to the usno a2.0 catalog @xcite .",
    "an iterative procedure maps the star centers from each picture onto a standard set of tangent - plane coordinates , and offsets as a function of time are derived , which are then fit for parallax and proper motion .",
    "when conditions are appropriate , standardized photometry in @xmath7 and @xmath6 is obtained using @xcite standards for calibration .    in order to verify the procedures used in the mdm parallax program and to estimate the external accuracy , the fields of five ` parallax standards '",
    "were included .",
    "these were selected from among the lhs stars measured by @xcite .",
    "the agreement is satisfactory , showing that the procedures are essentially correct . during the reductions it was noticed that a star near the edge of the field of lhs 1889 showed a large proper motion and parallax and a very red @xmath8 color .",
    "this proved to be 2mass j07003664 + 3157266 ( hereafter 2mass 0700 + 3157 ) ; table 1 lists its parameters .",
    "1 gives a finding chart , and fig .",
    "2 shows its path across the sky and its parallactic ellipse .",
    "the colors and absolute magnitude in table 1 yielded a preliminary classification of l3 .",
    "because 2mass 0700 + 3157 is much redder than the reference - frame stars , we must be careful with differential color refraction ( dcr ) ; @xcite discuss the problem .",
    "the @xmath6-band filter used here is narrower and redder than that used by @xcite , which ameliorates the problem by a factor of about four .",
    "even so , we did apply a correction , and confined most of the exposures to within @xmath9 hour of meridian passage .",
    "one set of exposures  unfortunately the only set with a large negative @xmath10 parallax factor  was taken at hour angles @xmath11 . excluding these exposures changed @xmath12 from 81 to 79 mas .",
    "for the exposure farthest from the meridian , the full amplitude of the dcr correction relative to the comparison stars ( typically @xmath13 ) was 13 mas ; allowing a generous 30 percent uncertainty in the dcr coefficient would shift the centroid in that image by 4 mas .",
    "this is as bad as it gets , so dcr evidently does not affect the parallax too seriously .      the l dwarf candidate was confirmed spectroscopically on 2003 jan 02 ut using the low resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris ; @xcite ) at the 10 m w.  m.  keck - i observatory on mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "two consecutive 300 s exposures were obtained . a 400 lines / mm grating blazed at 8500   was used with a 1@xmath14 slit and 2048@xmath152048 ccd to produce 7- - resolution spectra covering the range 6300  10100  .",
    "an og570 filter eliminated second - order light .",
    "the data were reduced and calibrated using standard iraf routines .",
    "quartz - lamp flat - field exposures of the dome were used to normalize the response of the detector , and stellar spectra were extracted using _",
    "apextract_. the wavelength calibration is from a near arc lamp exposures taken immediately after the 2mass 0700 + 3157 observations , and the flux calibration is from an observation of hiltner 600 @xcite taken immediately before the observations of the target .",
    "3 shows the reduced spectrum .",
    "the data are not corrected for telluric absorption , so atmospheric o@xmath16 bands at 6867 - 7000 , 7594 - 7685   and h@xmath16o bands at 7186 - 7273 , 8161 - 8282 , @xmath178950 - 9300 , @xmath179300 - 9650   are evident .",
    "the spectral type was assigned following the guidelines established in @xcite .",
    "the resulting values of the classification ratios defined in that paper are crh - a = 1.58(2 ) , rb - b / tio - b = 1.21(3 - 4 ) , and cs - a / vo - b = 1.18(3 - 4 ) , and the fit to the doublet indicates a subtype of ( 3 ) .",
    "this gives a final spectral type of l3.5 .",
    "using the human eye alone to judge the type results in the same spectral type of l3.5 because the spectrum of 2mass 0700 + 3157 is morphologically intermediate between the spectral standards 2massw j1146345 + 223053 ( l3 ) and 2massw j1155009 + 230706 ( l4 ) taken with the same instrumental setup .",
    "the spectral type is almost exactly as predicted on the basis of the colors and absolute magnitude .",
    "the spectrum shows neither li i @xmath186708 absorption , nor h@xmath19 emission , to equivalent width limits of 0.3 and 0.2    respectively .",
    "our spectrum does not provide an accurate radial velocity , but the transverse velocity is well - determined from the proper motion and parallax ( see table 1 ) . the kinematics appear typical of a disk population object",
    ".    there does not appear to be any physical association between the l dwarf and the original target , lhs 1889 .",
    "the two stars proper motions are similar but significantly different , and the parallax of the l dwarf puts it significantly closer than lhs 1889 , for which @xcite obtain @xmath20 mas , and we find @xmath21 mas .    as noted earlier , the number of l - dwarfs with known parallax is still modest .",
    "the unusual channel through which this object was discovered immediately yielded a parallax and placed it well within the 25 pc limit of the @xcite catalog of nearby stars .",
    "this is among the closer and apparently brighter l dwarfs , yet it escaped detection until now , probably because of the relatively crowded field ( @xmath22 degrees ) .",
    "l dwarfs have mostly been selected as 2mass or denis detections without optical counterparts , a criterion which is difficult to apply to fast - moving objects in crowded fields .",
    "sdss , another prolific source of l - dwarf discoveries , is not covering low latitudes .",
    "interestingly , @xcite recently discovered an apparently even closer l dwarf at low latitude in their proper motion survey .",
    "it is very likely that other undiscovered l dwarfs lurk nearby at low latitude .",
