    "it has been long known that fluid motions start from streamlined laminar state , undergo _ laminar - turbulent transition _ and evolve into randomly fluctuating poly - scaled turbulence ( reynolds 1883 ; taylor 1923 ; schubauer & skramstad 1947 ) . in the eulerian description of the motion of an incompressible , homogeneous newtonian fluid , the navier - stokes equations of motion and the continuity read @xmath0 where vector @xmath1 are the velocity having the components @xmath2 , the scalar quantity @xmath3 denotes the pressure , @xmath4 the space variable , and @xmath5 the laplacian .",

    "we are interested in the initial - boundary value problem of ( [ ns ] ) from given data of finite energy @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the no - slip boundary condition applies on the ( smooth ) boundary of the domain @xmath11 @xmath12 taking divergence of ( [ ns ] ) and utilising the continuity , we derive a poisson equation for the pressure @xmath13 whose solution is well - known .",
    "vorticity is a physical ( vector ) quantity , @xmath14 and is related to the angular momentum in flow motions .",
    "the vorticity equation is @xmath15 the vorticity field inherits the solenoidal property of ( [ ns ] ) @xmath16 . at",
    "every given instant of time , we recover the velocity from the di - vorticity from the biot - savart relation @xmath17 where @xmath18 stands for the laplacian inverse in @xmath11 satisfying ( [ bc ] ) .",
    "this is an elliptic relation , just like the solution of ( [ pp ] ) .",

    "each set of the equations defines a _ parabolic - elliptic _ system by the assumption of incompressibility .",
    "the navier - stokes equations describe the mean velocity as well as pressure ( in the sense of ensemble averages ) and do not model the random fluctuations in turbulent motions . for practical purposes , it is precisely the motive underlying the continuum hypothesis where only mean flow quantities , such as skin friction and average energy dissipation increase over transition , really matter .",
    "the study of the transitional dynamics is to address the mechanism of _ en masse _ scale initiation by the term @xmath19 .",
    "consequently , the causality of external disturbances on flow development is of secondary importance ; the effects of extraneous forcing can only be well - quantified once the intrinsic transition has been understood . in the present paper",

    "we shall present our numerical evidence for the intrinsic process in small - viscosity flows . by examining the solutions ,",
    "we anticipate to distinguish the hallmarks of the transition process as identified from experiments .",
    "burgers equation refers to the parabolic equation in one space dimension ( burgers 1948 ) : @xmath20 we seek its solutions subject to initial - boundary conditions , @xmath21 two initial data examined in the present paper are given by @xmath22 which evolves into a boundary layer near @xmath23 for constant intensity @xmath24 , and @xmath25 whose time - wise development resembles the formation of a shear layer or a standing saw - tooth shock in the vicinity of @xmath26 .    in many textbooks on differential equations ,",

    "we may blame the negligence of certain dissipation in our model . in part",
    ", the contradiction is due to our mathematical analysis . consider the motion in time reversal ( or adjoint in a sense ) , @xmath33 .",
    "now the blow - up solution becomes @xmath34 which is globally regular for the identical positive data .",
    "the first law suggests that the blow - up option must be discarded , in the same way as choosing exponentially damped eigen - states .",
    "similar principles hold for equations containing a cubic non - linearity @xmath35 .",
    "the singularity scenarios violating the thermodynamic principles have no justifications in classical physics .    the quadratic non - linearity in ( [ beqn ] ) epitomises a number of natural phenomena in continuum .",
    "its analytical properties have been exploited and elucidated for prototype problems in turbulence , shock formation and aerodynamics ( see , for instance , burgers 1974 ; whitham 1974 ) .",
    "roughly speaking , the non - linear advection - diffusion term has an identical form as those in the navier - stokes equations ; it represents the energy transport per unit mass on macroscopic scale : @xmath36 then the energy integral @xmath37 in view of the boundary conditions .",
    "the flux is determined by the normal gradients on the boundary @xmath38 that is conserved only in flows satisfying @xmath39 ( sometimes known as the second boundary value problems ) .",
    "the shear stress on the ` wall ' @xmath23 per unit density for ( [ bl ] ) is given by @xmath40 similarly , we are interested in the local shear at the ` centre ' of ( [ shear ] ) @xmath41 .    multiplying ( [ beqn ] ) by @xmath32 and integrating the result over space , we obtain the energy conservation law @xmath42 in addition , the energy law ( [ energy ] ) shows that the velocity at any instant must satisfy @xmath43 this bound may serve as a useful criterion to monitor computations . for convenience",

    "an increasing amount of vorticity of smaller scales must be generated by the non - linearity ( @xmath53 ) in order for the law of energy conservation to be fulfilled , thus producing enhanced local shear thanks to the presence of viscosity .",

    "vorticity or scale proliferation_.    evidently , it is a challenge to numerically evaluate all the terms of the series . in practice",
    ", one would prefer to bypass the direct evaluations but to solve the dynamic equation ( [ beqn ] ) by more efficient algorithms .",

    ", we do not identify viscosity as reynolds number @xmath56 in the initial - boundary problem .",
    "this view asserts that any time - independent flow generated in laboratory or in nature , if exists , must be preceded by a time - dependent dynamics which galvanises contiguous shear diversity .",
    "general solutions of burgers equation can be written in a closed analytical form ( cole 1951 ; hopf 1950 ) .",

    "velocity @xmath32 is given by a _ ratio _ of two rapid - changing exponentials , one remedy is that we scale both @xmath63 and @xmath76 by suitably chosen functions so that the numerical difficulty may be avoided .",

    "nevertheless , it is clear that the pair are not unique and depend on the initial data as well as the local flow .",

    ". at least an order of magnitude improvement has been achieved compared to the best known exact solutions ( cole 1951 ; basdevant , _ et al .",

    "results of @xmath83 or @xmath84 at selected time . [ cols=\">,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     figure  [ tevot ] shows that the turbulence quickly ` forgets ' its initial energy content at small viscosity .",
    "the characteristic of the long - time decay is presented in figure  [ tevoblsh ] . for @xmath85 , the local enstrophy attenuates according to @xmath86 in the boundary layer starting from ( [ bl ] ) , and @xmath87 at the location of the maximum viscous dissipation in the turbulent free - shear originated from data ( [ shear ] ) .",
    "the decay graphs in figure  [ tevot ] assert that the initial data ( known as large eddies ) have no influence on the attenuation rate .",
    "hence these decay laws are valid for arbitrary finite @xmath88 .    since the vorticity near the wall or around the centre accounts for over @xmath89 of the total shear strength , the local decays suggest that the law of energy decay is @xmath90",
    "out numerical results may be compared to experiment , particularly to the case of blasius boundary layer on a flat plate .",
    "to relate the calculations to experiments , we may take the length scale @xmath23 m and the initial speed @xmath91 m / s .",
    "the phenomenon of the shear intensification takes place in a time @xmath92 s in fluids with viscosity @xmath93 m@xmath94/s .",
    "it is established in laboratory experiment that there is an abrupt growth in wall shear over transition region , see , for example , schubauer & klebanoff ( 1955 ) . at a free stream turbulence level of @xmath95",
    ", the observed laminar - turbulent transition can not be distorted by the free - stream turbulence intensity ; the test transition is therefore the intrinsic transition embedded in the navier - stokes equations . from figure  3 of schubauer & klebanoff ,",
    "the shear increase occurs over a time interval of @xmath96 s , given a uniform free - stream speed of @xmath97 m / s .",
    "moreover , referring to their figure  4 , the intense vorticity concentrates in a spatial length scale of @xmath98 mm . comparing the measurements ( figure  [ skexpt ] ) and the numerical simulation ( figure  [ rkduc ] ) , the measured abrupt increase in wall shear is in qualitative agreement .",
    "the scale proliferation anticipates the time - wise occurrence of the shear build - up ( the laminar - turbulent transition ) .",
    "the familiar friction jump over the transition ( figure  [ cfexpt ] ) is a consequence of the non - linear growth .",
    "even though burgers equation is merely one - dimensional , its solutions provide convincing evidence on the process of the scale proliferation which is essentially responsible for the abrupt local vorticity intensification .",
    "turbulence is characterised by vortices of multitudinous scales whose topology encompasses a variety of geometry subject to continuous modifications by momentum transfer and diffusion . to describe turbulence in terms of fourier components",
    "requires justification because the flow scales defined by means of the wave components are certainly misguided portrayals of the genuine spatio - temporal structure .",
    "a critical prcis on this fundamental issue is given in  6.6.4 of davidson ( 2004 ) .",
    "on the continuum , the propensity for free deformation characterises fluids and is a precursor to resist instability .",
    "analytically , motions of both laminar and turbulent states are governed by the navier - stokes equations , _ not _ by ginzburg - landau or kuramoto - sivashinsky equation",
    ". solutions of the full equations are globally regular and hence they do not bifurcate in space and in time . specifically",
    ", the solutions can not develop any finite - time singularity for any initial data of bounded energy .",
    "it has been established in careful experiments that the laminar - turbulent transition _ persists _ once the free - stream turbulence or the acoustic noise are below some threshold level ( schubauer & skramstad 1947 ; wells 1967 ) .",
    "the intensive local accumulation of vorticity is not connected to absolute instability engendered by spatially - amplified disturbances at selective frequencies ; the apparent flow breakdown at fixed spatial locations observed in experiments is nothing more than a misreading of the fine - scale dynamic evolution .",
    "although the intrinsic transition is fully instigated by the non - linearity , disturbances may be abundant in varied forms in practice .",
    "frequently , an observed transition is an aberration of the non - linear process .",
    "however , the disturbances can be quantified and specified as part of the initial or boundary conditions ; the modified problem is well - defined and hence computationally tractable .    in application , we may consider the effect of external control by adding a prescribed force , @xmath99 , to burgers equation .",
    "similarly , the no - slip boundary conditions may be suitably modified in design of flow control . since the equation resembles the vorticity equation for 2-dimensional incompressible viscous flow , investigation of the vorticity evolution at high reynolds numbers looks promising .",
    "in fact , our numerical scheme needs minor modifications so as to embrace vorticity stretching @xmath100 in 3 space dimensions .",
    "as expected , the computation cost will be more substantial but would no longer be prohibitively expensive .",
    "the non - local nature of vorticity on velocity has to be taken into account and its effect is expected to reduce overall shear strength .",
    "burgers equation is innocuous but is a well - chosen model for the full navier - stokes equations as they share many of the essential analytic characters . from the present study ,",
    "we are able to advance our understanding in one critical aspect : the governing equations furnish a reliable tool for predicting the laminar - turbulent transition , not only for the onset of the phenomenon but the complete process . in an averaged sense",
    ", the transition is an intrinsic part of the flow evolution driven by the non - linearity and the energy conservation . in reality ,",
    "viscous dissipation occurs at all time and stirs up randomness when the vorticity proliferation is amply operational .",
    "turbulence is the incessant assembly of material subdivision .",
    "it is a fundamental fact that the transitional dynamics is galilean invariant .",
    "real shock waves and viscous wall layers have finite thickness @xmath101 .",
    "viscosity is the key as it determines the spatial scales in the shear layers and irons out any discontinuity .",
    "we summarise the development of shear flows in several generic stages : ( 1 ) the initial shear growth is almost linearly with time at all values of viscosity ; ( 2 ) there exists a time interval in which shear strength in localised region abruptly increases . the surge in vorticity due to the non - linearity marks the birth of turbulence ; ( 3 ) the end stage",
    "is easily identified when the local enstrophy attains a maximum value ; ( 4 ) the flow is fully turbulent and subsequently hibernates in a lengthy decaying period , particularly at small viscosity .",
    "the decay is governed by a power - law of time .",
    "the mathematical form of equation ( [ beqn ] ) is identical to the kpz equation ( kardar _ et al .",
    "_ 1986 ) for material interface growth or erosion due to vapour deposition . in astrophysics ,",
    "suggestion has been put forward to use @xmath102 burgers equation to model long - time self - organisation of the large structure in the universe ( see , for example , woyczyski 1998 ) .",
    "the model is expected to be able to simulate formation of cellular structures in mass distribution .",
    "no claims have ever been made on the validity of the continuum hypothesis at all spatio - temporal scales .",
    "it is well - established , from physics , that diffusion equation and the equations of general relativity have their limitations at atomic scales or are surely invalid at the planck scale of length and time .",
    "ironically , the global regularity of equation ( [ beqn ] ) and of ( [ ns ] ) asserts that these equations of fluid motion hold beyond the planck scales for finite @xmath103 !",
