    "the success of any handwriting recognition system is heavily dependent on the amount and nature of data used in training the system .",
    "arabic handwriting recognition is not an exception . over the past two decades",
    ", numerous datasets for arabic handwriting recognition were collected to keep advancing the state of the art in the challenging task .",
    "techniques for arabic handwritten word recognition can be classified into two main categories : word - based methods and character - based methods . in word - based methods ,",
    "the segmentation of words into their constituting letters is not required .",
    "typically , these methods rely on hidden markov models ( hmms )  @xcite in the open - vocabulary scenario . in the closed vocabulary scenario ,",
    "global features can be used with any classification algorithm , e.g.  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "character - based methods require pre - segmentation of words into characters or parts of characters .",
    "after the segmentation , trained character models are used to classify groups of consecutive segments into characters  @xcite .",
    "coming from a computer vision background , we believe that a new paradigm for word recognition ought to be explored .",
    "this paradigm bases word recognition on individual character detection .",
    "suppose that we can build strong models for recognizing individual characters in all possible shapes .",
    "these models can be deployed to find characters in a given input image without using heuristics for segmenting words into characters . in other words , word segmentation into characters",
    "can be obtained by detecting the presence and locations of the constituting characters of a word . to train such models ,",
    "a very large collection of samples from alphabet characters , in all their possible shapes , has to be available . towards this goal , we started collecting the alexu - word dataset .",
    "the alexu - word dataset is collected with the main goal of having a large number of samples from few and simple words that contain all arabic alphabet characters in all possible shapes .",
    "the current version of the dataset contains @xmath0 samples from @xmath1 unique arabic words .",
    "the future plan is to extend the dataset by adding more words and more samples , and to segment the collected words into their constituting characters in order to form a very large database of segmented characters .",
    "the current version of the dataset is suitable for closed - vocabulary isolated word recognition .",
    "we evaluated a couple of global word descriptors with three different classifiers on this task .",
    "the best accuracy obtained was @xmath3 word recognition rate .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : relwork ] , a summary of related work is presented . in section",
    "[ sec : alexuword ] , details of the dataset collection and characteristics are presented . in section  [ sec : exp ] , our experimental evaluation on the word recognition task is presented .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : conc ] , the paper is concluded .",
    "over the past @xmath4 years , many datasets have been collected for arabic offline handwriting recognition ( aohr ) .",
    "a comprehensive list can be found in a recent survey  @xcite .",
    "by far , the most commonly used and one of the largest publicly available datasets for aohr is the ifn / enit dataset  @xcite .",
    "it contains the names of over @xmath5 tunisian cities , with over @xmath6 samples in total .",
    "the dataset is useful for closed - vocabulary handwriting recognition .",
    "however , there is no effort made to uniformly cover all letters of the alphabet in all shapes , or to make it easy to segment the collected words into letters for segmented - letter training .",
    "perhaps , the closest dataset to ours in the collection philosophy is  @xcite , where a small number of words were chosen to cover all possible shapes of arabic alphabet characters .",
    "however , the number of word samples available is only @xmath7 , which is too far from our target .",
    "the current version of alexu - word dataset contains @xmath0 samples .",
    "the closest dataset to ours in terms of the number of samples is al - isra dataset  @xcite .",
    "it contains @xmath8 word samples .",
    "however , we have not been able to find a way to obtain a copy from the dataset .",
    "there are other more specialized datasets .",
    "for example , @xcite is only for numeral recognition .",
    "the dataset collected in  @xcite focused on the most commonly used @xmath9 words in arabic , which may not have all variations of arabic alphabet characters .",
    "the khatt dataset  @xcite is the most recent and largest dataset collected for handwritten arabic .",
    "it contains close to @xmath10 samples covering a large collection of words from different topic areas in arabic literature .",
    "the dataset may exhibit the natural distribution of characters in typical arabic writing .",
    "however , it is still not designed with the task of character detection in mind .",
    "alexu - word dataset contains @xmath0 samples from @xmath1 different arabic words .",
    "the word samples are collected from @xmath2 different writers . among the writers ,",
    "there were @xmath11 males and @xmath12 females ; and @xmath13 right - handed and @xmath14 left - handed .",
    "details of writer and word distribution are given in table  [ tab : writerworddist ] .",
    "right - handed & @xmath15 & @xmath16 & @xmath17 + left - handed & @xmath18 & @xmath19 & @xmath20 + total & @xmath21 & @xmath22 & @xmath23 +    the @xmath1 arabic words in the dataset were chosen to cover all possible cases for each letter in the alphabet .",
    "an arabic word can be made of one or more connected groups of letters , each group is known as a part of arabic word or a paw .",
    "each letter of the arabic alphabet can have at most four different cases ( hence , shapes ) , depending on its position with respect to the containing paw : beginning of a paw , middle of a paw , end of a paw , or isolated ( i.e. a standalone paw ) .",
    "since the arabic alphabet contains @xmath24 different letters , and each can have up to four different cases , at most @xmath25 words can cover all letters in all cases .",
    "we chose 109 unique words to collect in our dataset .",
    "the words were selected to be short and simple so that future segmentation of the words into letters becomes easy .",
    "in fact , the words were collected from an android application that teaches children about the arabic alphabet and their shapes .",
    "the chosen words are illustrated in the sample form models in fig .",
    "[ fig : sampleforms ] .",
    "alexu - word dataset was collected at the faculty of engineering , alexandria university , alexandria , egypt .",
    "928 different writers originally participated in the collection process ; data from @xmath26 of them were discarded in the verification process to end up with data from @xmath2 writers only .",
    "all writers were in the ages from 18 to 25 years old .",
    "most of the participants were students in the preparatory year of the faculty .",
    "data was collected during the lab instructing times of the introduction to computers course .",
    "each writer was asked to fill out only a one - page form . due to the busy lab time",
    ", the form design was made as simple as possible to minimize the collection time .",
    "each form contained a table of 28 arabic words , where each word appeared printed in one cell of the table , next to it , an empty cell was left for the associated handwritten sample .",
    "four different form models were used to cover all possible cases of arabic letter , as explained above .",
    "a sample from each form appears in fig .",
    "[ fig : sampleforms ] .",
    "writers were provided with blue pens , all of the same kind , to facilitate form processing , as explained in section  [ sec : processing ] .",
    "[ fig : sampleforms_model1 ] [ fig : sampleforms_model2 ] [ fig : sampleforms_model3 ] [ fig : sampleforms_model4 ]    in addition to handwriting the form words , each writer also was asked to specify his / her gender and handedness .",
    "distribution of writers among different form models is shown in table  [ tab : writerdistpermodel ] .",
    "distribution of word counts among different form models is shown in table  [ tab : worddistpermodel ] .",
    "note that although each form contains exactly @xmath24 words , the word counts are not always a multiple of @xmath24 .",
    "this is due to the exclusion of some words in the verification process , as explained in section  [ sec : processing ] .",
    "male / right - handed & @xmath27 & @xmath28 & @xmath29 & @xmath30 + male / left - handed & @xmath26 & @xmath31 & @xmath32 & @xmath33 + female / right - handed & @xmath34 & @xmath35 & @xmath36 & @xmath37 + female / left - handed & @xmath38 & @xmath39 & @xmath40 & @xmath39 + total & @xmath41 & @xmath42 & @xmath43 & @xmath44 +     male / right - handed & @xmath45 & @xmath46 & @xmath47 & @xmath48 + male / left - handed & @xmath49 & @xmath50 & @xmath51 & @xmath52 + female / right - handed & @xmath53 & @xmath54 & @xmath55 & @xmath56 + female / left - handed & @xmath57 & @xmath58 & @xmath59 & @xmath60 + total & @xmath61 & @xmath62 & @xmath63 & @xmath64 +      each collected form was scanned at the resolution of @xmath65 dpi .",
    "this gives us forms similar to the ones shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sampleforms ] .",
    "as can be observed in the figure , scanned forms can be slightly rotated or translated with respect to a perfectly upright position . to automatically extract handwritten samples ,",
    "forms are first transformed to a canonical size and upright position . to achieve this , the rhombus - shaped markers at the four corners of the form",
    "are detected , and the form is transformed according to their positions to the upright canonical pose , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : formalignment ] .",
    "the markers were detected using a version of the form that is scaled @xmath66 times down .",
    "on this version , harris corner detection was applied and the four outermost detected corners were considered corresponding to the four rhombus - shaped markers .    [",
    "fig : sampleforms_model1_scanned ] [ fig : sampleforms_model1_aligned ]    after the form is transformed to the canonical form , the location of writer information fields and handwritten words become known . since writers were asked to use blue pens , only the blue channel of the canonical form",
    "was processed .",
    "the blue channel is binarized to give only the ink areas . by comparing the overall ink - stained areas in writer info s options , we can determine which choice he / she made , regardless of the way the writer used to highlight them , e.g. a check mark or mere filling .",
    "binary images for handwritten words were extracted from each form , empty areas surrounding a word were removed so that the stored binary image contains only the word without any margin .",
    "due to errors in scanning and due to the possibility of imperfect parameter adjustments in the previous steps , some extracted word images either were not tight around the word ( i.e. contained some nearby noise spots ) , contained only a part of the word , contained only a part of the background , or unrecognizable handwriting due to severe scanning errors or writer s scratching .",
    "all extracted images were manually inspected by the authors . in the case of images that are loosely cropped ,",
    "extra margins were removed . in the other cases ,",
    "the images were completely removed from the dataset .",
    "examples of cropping corrections are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wordcorrection ] . examples of removed images are shown in fig .",

    "the ultimate goal after collecting alexu - word dataset is to perform letter segmentation and train classifiers on individual characters .",
    "until the whole dataset is collected and letter segmentation is performed , the dataset can be used for evaluating closed - vocabulary word - recognition methods . in this section ,",
    "we provide base - line comparison among a couple of window - based descriptors , inspired from the computer - vision literature , across a number of classification algorithms . in section  [ sec : feats_cls ] , our window - based descriptors are explained . in section  [ sec : expsetup ] , our experimental setup is explained . in section  [ sec : wordrec ] , the word classification results are presented .      in another study of our group ,",
    "window - based descriptors were introduced and compared on the task of isolated arabic letter recognition  @xcite .",
    "two of the top performing descriptors in this work were based on the histograms of oriented gradients ( hog ) descriptor  @xcite and the scale invariant feature transform ( sift ) descriptor  @xcite , two very popular descriptors in the object detection and recognition literature .    in order to better represent the shape of a letter , torki et al .",
    "@xcite , used a spatial pyramid construction of the hog and sift descriptor with overlapping sub - windows , which they called hog7 and sift7 .",
    "the number @xmath33 at the end of each descriptor s name represents the number of sub - windows of the input image on which the descriptor is constructed .",
    "particularly , the descriptor is computed as follows .",
    "the base descriptor ( hog or sift ) is constructed once for the entire image .",
    "then , it is constructed three times for three overlapping vertical strips from the image , each of which has half the image s width with an equal step between each consecutive two of them . finally ,",
    "similarly , it is constructed three times for three overlapping horizontal strips from the image , each of which has half the image s height with an equal step between each consecutive two of them .",
    "illustration of the overlapping sub - window division is shown in figure  [ fig : overlappingsubwindows ] .",
    "the descriptors from the seven windows are concatenated to make the final descriptor .",
    "the two descriptors , hog7 and sift7 ( section  [ sec : feats_cls ] ) , are experimented with three classification algorithms , k - nearest neighbor ( k - nn ) , artificial neural networks ( ann ) , and support vector machines ( svm ) . to train each classifier ,",
    "the word samples in the dataset are divided into training ( around @xmath67 ) , testing ( around @xmath68 ) , and validation sets ( around @xmath68 ) .",
    "details of division of words over the three sets are given in table  [ tab : evaluationsetup ] .",

    "then , the training and validation sets were combined to train the classifier using the best parameters .",
    "the final reported accuracy is based on applying this classifier on the testing set .",
    "the best parameters for each classifier - descriptor pair are shown in table  [ tab : classifierparams ] .",
    "note that for ann , one hidden layer of @xmath84 nodes was always used .",
    "also , the activation function was the sigmoid function , the number of iterations in this validation phase was fixed at @xmath84 iterations , and the optimization algorithm used was gradient descent . for svm , only the linear kernel was used .",
    "k - nn & @xmath85 & @xmath86 + ann & @xmath87 & @xmath88 + svm & @xmath89 & @xmath90 +      the final classification accuracies for the three classifiers are shown in figure  [ tab : wordrecresults ] .",
    "these results are obtained by training each classifier on the combination of training and validation sets using the best parameters obtained on the validation set , as shown in table  [ tab : classifierparams ] .",
    "the other fixed parameters , as explained in section  [ sec : expsetup ] , remained the same here , except for the number of iterations in ann , which was raised to @xmath91 in this phase .",
    "k - nn & @xmath92 & @xmath93 + ann & @xmath94 & @xmath3 + svm & @xmath95 & @xmath96 +    the superiority of the sift7 descriptor over the hog7 descriptor with all classifiers is clear .",
    "even the naive k - nn classifier performs quite well with sift7 by scoring @xmath97 accuracy , with a big difference from hog7 , which scores @xmath98 accuracy with the same classifier .    in terms of classifiers , k - nn is understandably the least performing , and ann is slightly superior to svm .",
    "superiority of ann can be due to its non - linearity since we only used the linear kernel with svm .",
    "the confusion matrix of the best classifier is shown in figure  [ fig : confmat ] .",
    "the confusion matrix is strongly sparse and diagonal , which indicates that the classifier can easily distinguish between most pairs of classes .",
    "in fact , there are nine word classes that can be classified with @xmath99 accuracy , which are shown in figure  [ fig : leastconfusing ] . inspecting the confusion matrix for the most confusing classes , the most confusing five pairs of words were determined to be the ones shown in figure  [ fig : mostconfusing ] .",
