    "human behavior is hierarchically structured . even simple actions ",
    "checking email , for example  consist of many steps , which span levels of description and complexity : _ moving _ fingers , arms , eyes ; _ choosing _ whether to use the mouse or keyboard ; _ searching _ for the email app among the others that are open , etc .",
    "human behavior is also efficient : we attempt to perform each part of each action as swiftly and successfully as we can , at the least possible cost .",
    "classical models of how humans understand the actions of others ( originating from the plan recognition literature  @xcite ) seek to leverage this hierarchical structure by building in prior knowledge of others high - level actions , tasks , and goals .",
    "behavioral evidence has shown that adults and even infants can learn simple hierarchical action structures from data , segmenting novel sequences along statistical action boundaries  @xcite .",
    "these abilities can be captured with a nonparametric action segmentation model  @xcite , which learns lists of actions that occur in sequence , and potentially cause observable effects .",
    "however , purely statistical learning from data leaves implicit the intrinsic efficiency of intentional actions . for adults and infants ,",
    "the assumption that others actions are rational functions of their beliefs , desires , and goals is fundamental  @xcite . rather than simply memorizing repeated action sequences ,",
    "people infer goals of complexity sufficient to rationalize these actions  @xcite .",
    "a simple formalization of people s theory of rational , goal - directed action can be given in terms of approximately rational planning in markov decision processes ( mdps ) , and human goal inferences can be accurately predicted using bayesian inference over models of mdp planning ( or inverse planning )  @xcite .",
    "this approach is closely related to recent plan recognition algorithms developed in the ai literature  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. ) .    in this paper , we integrate hierarchically structured actions into the inverse planning framework using hierarchical mdps  @xcite .",
    "we consider scenarios in which agents pursue sequences of subgoals enroute to various destinations .",
    "each destination can have multiple subgoal sequences , generated by a nonparametric bayesian model .",
    "together , a destination and subgoal sequence induce a hierarchical mdp , and agents actions are assumed to be generated by approximately rational planning in this mdp .",
    "representing agents subgoal - based plans allows segmentation of behavior into extended chunks , separated by sparse subgoal boundaries , and can achieve greater generalization than purely statistical models by naturally capturing the context - sensitivity of rational action sequences , rather than having to learn new sequences for each context .",
    "further , the model predicts deviations from rationality ( with respect to a single subgoal ) at subgoal boundaries  a strong cue to hierarchical structure .",
    "this inductive bias should enable efficient learning of subgoal structure from small numbers of examples .",
    "we present two experiments to test our model .",
    "the first is a behavioral experiment , in which human participants inferred the subgoal structure underlying series of action sequences .",
    "the second experiment is a simulation to show that the model is useful in an artificial user support task .",
    "the model first learns the subgoal structure of the task from a small number of observations .",
    "then , the model infers a user s destination and subgoals from a partial action sequence , and attempts to assist the user to achieve a subset of the remaining subgoals . for each experiment",
    ", we compare the performance of our model with that of several natural alternatives .",
    "[ fig : pp_str ] represents the structure of our model in terms of separate graphical models for the hierarchical mdp and nonparametric subgoal models .",
    "these graphical models specify the structure of the joint distributions over actions , state sequences , and subgoal sequences .",

    "fig : pp_str](a ) ) .",
    "the remainder of this section will first define the hierarchical mdp induced by a given destination and subgoal sequence , and derive the likelihood of a subgoal sequence , given an observed state sequence .",
    "then we describe the nonparametric model of subgoal sequences , and a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method for jointly inferring the number and composition of the subgoal sequences underlying a series of action sequences .",
    "finally , we show how to use subgoal sequences learned from previous observations to predict the subgoals and destination of a novel partial action sequence .",
    "ll    [ fig : pp_str ]      our hierarchical mdp formulation is closely related to the options framework for hierarchical reinforcement learning  @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", we assume that actions and state transitions are deterministic , that each action incurs a cost of 2 , that the discount factor @xmath13 , and that the destination yields a reward of 100 once all subgoals have been achieved .",

    "[ fig : pp_str](a ) , the variable @xmath14 keeps track of the current subgoal at time @xmath4 . assume the current subgoal is @xmath15 ; if the agent reaches the current subgoal , i.e. , @xmath16 , then @xmath17 should be the next subgoal , otherwise the subgoal should stay the same ( @xmath18 ) .    based on this , an observed sequence @xmath1 can be divided into multiple segments corresponding to @xmath5 .",
    "we define boundary @xmath19 to be the first timestep @xmath4 after @xmath20 is achieved : @xmath21 ; @xmath22 .",
    "we write the boundary vector @xmath23 .",

    "otherwise , @xmath1 does not satisfy @xmath5 , so @xmath27 should be 0 .",

    "@xmath31 is a softmax policy of the local mdp state - action value function for subgoal @xmath32 , based on the assumption that the observed agent plans approximately rationally , stochastically maximizing expected reward and minimizing cost .",
    "a similar likelihood computation was used by  @xcite within an mcmc method for inferring subgoal sequences from user demonstrations . however , this approach focused on learning only one subgoal sequence from one action sequence ; in the next section , we describe a nonparametric bayesian model and mcmc methods for inferring multiple subgoal sequences , given a series of state sequences .",

    "our two experiments presented a `` warehouse '' scenario involving the delivery of various items to destinations in the environment shown in fig .",

    "for example , if the item list for fig .",
    "[ fig : warehouse](b ) is [ 2,8 ] , item 5 is a good add - on item for that delivery , because item 5 is the only additional item that does not require additional steps to obtain , given the start point , item list , and destination .",

    ", the action sequence could reach all subgoals without deviating from the shortest path to the destination .",
    "these cases were difficult in that they did not provide direct evidence for any subgoal . in the other type , the action had to make a detour to reach the subgoal , which provided stronger evidence for that subgoal .      in our mdp representation of the environment , @xmath0 corresponds to the agent location , and @xmath10 is the set of movements ( up , left , and right ) .",
