    "a hot , dense medium called the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) is created in high energy heavy ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "quarks and gluons scattered early in the collision live through the qgp phase and interact strongly with the medium .",
    "this leads to the suppression of hadrons at high transverse momenta relative to expectations from binary scaling in @xmath0+@xmath0collisions  @xcite , a process called jet quenching .",
    "one of the early indications of jet quenching was measurements of di - hadron correlationsat high transverse momenta ( @xmath1 )  @xcite .",
    "a high momentum particle created in an @xmath2+@xmath2collision is used as a proxy for a jet , assuming that a sufficiently high @xmath1particle originated from a jet and that its direction is approximately the direction of the parton .",
    "the distribution of softer particles in the event , called associated particles , can be measured in azimuth ( @xmath3 ) and pseudorapidity ( @xmath4 ) relative to the trigger particle .",
    "the correlation function has two peaks in azimuth , one near the trigger particle ( @xmath5 ) , called the near - side , and one 180@xmath6 away , called the away - side .",
    "the near - sideis roughly comparable to that observed in @xmath7and @xmath0+@xmath0collisions , with slight modifications  @xcite .",
    "numerous studies reported modifications of the away - sideshape , observing a local minimum rather than a peak  @xcite .",
    "this was frequently interpreted as a mach cone from a parton propagating faster than the speed of sound in the qgp  @xcite .",
    "we refer to this as the mach cone below .",
    "this feature indicated a qualitatively different interaction with the medium for the soft jets which dominate di - hadron correlationsand the hard jets observed at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "studies at the lhc indicated that the fragmentation functions were slightly modified  @xcite but studies of fully reconstructed jets have not indicated any severe shape modifications .",
    "the combinatorial background in azimuth in di - hadron correlationshas the form @xmath8 where @xmath9(@xmath10 ) are the fourier coefficients of the trigger ( associated ) particles in the background  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath11may arise due to hydrodynamical flow or jet quenching .",
    "the majority of di - hadron correlationstudies used the zero yield at minimum ( zyam ) method  @xcite , or some variation thereof , to determine the background level @xmath12 , combined with the assumption that independent measurements of the @xmath13were the appropriate @xmath11for these studies .",
    "the odd @xmath13were assumed to be zero until it was proposed that non - zero odd @xmath13could arise from fluctuations in the initial condition  @xcite .",
    "non - zero odd @xmath13were subsequently measured  @xcite .",
    "a majority of the published di - hadron correlationstherefore neglect the odd @xmath13 .",
    "while the observation of odd @xmath13indicated that at least the magnitude of the mach cone signal in the data was overestimated , theoretical studies of the mach cone continue  @xcite .",
    "the few di - hadron correlationstudies since the observation of odd @xmath13are either inconclusive about the presence or absence of shape modifications  @xcite or indicate that the shape modification persists  @xcite .",
    "we reassess the data using improved background subtraction techniques in order to determine the presence or absence of shape modifications and whether or not di - hadron correlationsare consistent with studies using fully reconstructed jets . in  @xcite we presented an alternate method for determining the background which overcomes many of the limitations of zyam , making fewer assumptions about the shape and level of the background .",
    "the reaction plane fit ( rpf ) method uses the correlation functions in the background dominated region on the near - side(@xmath14 , @xmath15 ) and the fact that the @xmath16depend on the reaction plane when the angle of the trigger particle is restricted relative to the event plane  @xcite .",
    "the correlation functions in bins of the angle of the trigger particle relative to the event plane are fit simultaneously to determine the @xmath12 , @xmath17 , and @xmath16 in equation  [ eqtn : jbbbcorrelations ] .",
    "this method makes fewer assumptions about the shape of the background than other methods . in this paper",
    "we apply this method to di - hadron correlationsbefore background subtraction measured by star  @xcite .",
    "we briefly review the relevant details of the measurement and then present di - hadron correlationsusing the rpf method  @xcite for background subtraction .",
    "in  @xcite correlation functions were reported for @xmath7collisions at @xmath18= 200 gev and for 2060% @xmath19collisions at @xmath18= 200 gev in bins of the angle between the trigger particle and the reconstructed reaction plane , @xmath20 in two regions in @xmath4(@xmath21  0.7 and 0.7  @xmath22  2.0 ) .",
    "the correlation functions were normalized by the number of trigger particles rather than by the number of events so all bins in @xmath23 have the same @xmath12 in equation  [ eqtn : jbbbcorrelations ] .",
    "the @xmath16 in a given @xmath23 bin depend on the range of the bin in @xmath23 , the @xmath24 , and the reaction plane resolution  @xcite .",
    "the systematic uncertainties on the reaction plane resolution were 1% for the second order reaction plane and 3% for the fourth and sixth  @xcite .",
    "the background is fit up to n  =  4 in equation  [ eqtn : jbbbcorrelations ] .",
    "the uncertainty due to the reaction plane resolution uncertainty is determined by varying the reaction plane resolution and refitting the background .",
    "the background determined from the background dominated region ( 0.7  @xmath22  2.0 ) must be scaled to determine the appropriate background level in the signal+background region ( @xmath21  0.7 ) .",
    "the correlation functions in  @xcite were not corrected for acceptance effects using mixed events , as in  @xcite .",
    "if the distribution of particles in the event were independent of @xmath25 , the exact scaling factor could be determined analytically , however , the @xmath25-dependent track distribution and tracking efficiency alter the ratio of the number of track pairs in the background - dominated region to the signal - dominated region .",
    "the background is scaled up by 2% more than expectations from an @xmath25-independent track distribution with a systematic error of 1% .",
    "the scale for the background is determined by comparison to the highest momentum associated momentum ( 3.0 @xmath26 4.0  gev/@xmath27 ) and trigger momentum ( 4.0 @xmath28 6.0  gev/@xmath27 ) .",
    "the same scaling is used for all momenta . note that the scale uncertainty is not a feature of the method and",
    "would be avoidable in future studies .",
    "the scale and reaction plane uncertainties are correlated point - to - point and when comparing correlations at different momenta .",
    "the statistical uncertainties on the @xmath19data include uncertainties due to the background determined by the fit in the rpf method and are therefore non - trivially correlated point - to - point .",
    "since the rpf method assumes that the residual signal in the background - dominated region is negligible , we restrict our study to high momenta ( 4.0 @xmath28 6.0  gev/@xmath27 and 1.5 @xmath26 4.0  gev/@xmath27 ) where pythia  @xcite studies indicate that the near- and away - sidepeaks are well separated .",
    "the @xmath7data in  @xcite are background subtracted and are therefore compared to the @xmath19data without modification .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     fit parameters from the rpf method are given in table  [ tab : vn ] .",
    "the @xmath16are within error for all @xmath29and the @xmath30 are consistent with zero .",
    "the @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) determined from the fit are larger ( smaller ) than the @xmath33 from inclusive particles from  @xcite .",
    "there are several possible explanations for differences between the inclusive @xmath13and the @xmath16determined from the rpf method",
    ". the terms equation  [ eqtn : jbbbcorrelations ] should be the weighted average of the product @xmath34 , rather than @xmath35 , and the average should be over background pairs .",
    "the centrality bin is wide and high @xmath1trigger particles are more likely to be in more central events , meaning that the background pair - averaged @xmath16 in  equation  [ eqtn : jbbbcorrelations ] is not necessarily the same as the inclusive @xmath13 .",
    "events which contain high @xmath1particles may not have the same properties as inclusive events , or the presence of a high @xmath1particle may be indicative of a hot spot in the medium .",
    "imperfect correlations between the n  =  2 and higher order reaction planes  @xcite , possibly due to a difference between the reaction plane for flow and jet quenching  @xcite , would reduce the @xmath16and increase @xmath17but the rpf method would still provide a valid description of the background .",
    "the fit parameters in table  [ tab : vn ] therefore should not be considered a measurement of the @xmath13due to flow . while the rpf method assumes that the large @xmath4correlation function on the near - sidecontains no signal , no assumptions are made about the event sample and the background is weighted correctly over background pairs by construction .",
    "the background determined using the rpf method is therefore more robust than that determined using the zyam method .",
    "background subtracted di - hadron correlationswith 4.0 @xmath28 6.0  gev/@xmath27 and 1.5 @xmath26 4.0  gev/@xmath27 in @xmath7and @xmath19collisions at @xmath18= 200 gev are shown in figure  [ fig : correlations ] .",
    "typical uncertainties in figure  [ fig : correlations ] are less than the uncertainty due to the background level alone using the zyam method and the uncertainty in the near - sidein - planepeak region is about one fifth of the uncertainty using zyam  @xcite .",
    "the data are inconsistent with the presence of the mach cone  @xcite , indicating that it was an artifact of the background subtraction .",
    "the yield is reported in order to quantitatively compare correlation functions in @xmath19collisions to @xmath7collisions .",
    "the yield is calculated as @xmath36 where the integration limits @xmath37 and @xmath38 on the near - sideand @xmath39 and @xmath40 on the away - sideare chosen to match the binning in the star data .",
    "the near - sideyield is given in figure  [ fig : yieldandrms](a ) and the away - sideyield in figure  [ fig : yieldandrms](b ) .",
    "these results have substantially smaller uncertainties than results using the zyam method  @xcite .",
    "the yield is highest for the lowest momenta .",
    "the near - sideyields in @xmath19collisions are within error of the yields in @xmath7collisions but the away - sideyields are below those in @xmath7collisions .",
    "@xmath41has been used to quantify the suppression observed in di - hadron correlations  @xcite , analogous to measurements of the nuclear modification factor .",
    "we calculate @xmath41as @xmath42 note that equation  [ eqtn : iaa ] differs from the standard definition of @xmath41 , which has the yield from @xmath0+@xmath0collisions in the denominator .",
    "no differences have been observed between di - hadron correlations in @xmath0+@xmath0and @xmath7  @xcite and only @xmath7data are available in  @xcite .",
    "the near - side@xmath41is given in figure  [ fig : yieldandrms](c ) and the away - side@xmath41 in figure  [ fig : yieldandrms](d ) .",
    "the near - side@xmath41is within error of 1.0 with little reaction plane dependence , although @xmath41is also consistent with the slight enhancement observed at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "the away - side@xmath41is around 0.3 for 3.0 @xmath26 4.0  gev/@xmath27 , increasing with increasing @xmath29 .",
    "the higher @xmath41for lower @xmath29is consistent with the softening of the fragmentation function expected in response to the medium .",
    "@xmath41is highest both in- and out - of - plane for 1.5 @xmath26 2.0  gev/@xmath27 .",
    "a similar trend is indicated for 2.0 @xmath26 3.0  gev/@xmath27 , although with less significance .",
    "correlations with a trigger out - of - planemay be more surface biased than those in - planeand therefore less modified , or they may interact with more medium .",
    "the reaction plane dependence observed may be due to an interplay between these effects .",
    "early results demonstrated a complete suppression of the away - sidein central collisions  @xcite , a highly cited and influential result .",
    "the @xmath41 in  @xcite is consistent within the large uncertainties with figure  [ fig : yieldandrms](a ) and figure  [ fig : yieldandrms](b ) for the same centralities .",
    "however , since we observe qualitatively different results from studies using the same methodology  @xcite , the complete suppression of the away - sidein  @xcite is likely also an artifact of the background subtraction .",
    "we also report the truncated rms @xmath43 where @xmath44 for the near - sideand @xmath45 for the away - siderather than the rms over all @xmath3because integration over a wide range in @xmath3increases the weight of statistical error bars without dramatically changing the result .",
    "the integration limits are the same as for equation  [ eqtn : yield ] .",
    "the near - siderms is given in figure  [ fig : yieldandrms](e ) and the away - siderms in figure  [ fig : yieldandrms](f ) .",
    "the near - siderms is larger than the @xmath7rms for the same @xmath29for all ranges of @xmath29studied .",
    "such broadening is consistent with expectations from energy loss through either bremsstrahlung or collisional energy loss , since the energy would remain spatially correlated with the parent parton but be distributed over a somewhat wider area  @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the near - sideis modified even though the yields are consistent with those in @xmath7collisions , consistent with observations in  @xcite . there is little indication of @xmath23-dependent modifications on the near - side",
    "the away - siderms in @xmath19collisions is mostly consistent with that in @xmath7collisions . since broadening is apparent on the near - side",
    ", this may indicate that the away - siderms is less sensitive to observation of broadening because the away - sideis already broader than the near - side , even in @xmath7collisions , due to the difference between the trigger particle s angle and the angle of the away - sidejet .",
    "these high precision results are consistent with the modification of fragmentation functions in @xmath46collisions observed at the lhc , which indicated broadening and softening of the fragmentation function  @xcite .",
    "this demonstrates the efficacy of the rpf method for precision studies of di - hadron and jet - hadron correlations , particularly at low momenta .",
    "the effects observed in di - hadron correlationsrelative to the reaction plane using the rpf method indicate that medium - induced modifications to jet - like correlations are more subtle than earlier results using the zyam method and neglecting odd @xmath13 .",
    "this indicates that jets do not equilibrate fully with the medium but lost energy remains spatially correlated with the parent parton and that the complete suppression observed in  @xcite was likely also an artifact of the background subtraction .",
    "these results agree better with results from fully reconstructed jets , which do not indicate dramatic shape modifications or complete equilibration but slight broadening and more subtle modifications of the fragmentation function  @xcite , than with earlier results indicating a dip  @xcite , or  mach cone  , on the away - side .",
