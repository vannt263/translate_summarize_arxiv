    "electroweak precision measurements in present particle physics provide a basic issue for the consistency tests of the standard model ( sm ) or its extensions .",
    "new phenomena physics can affect low energy processes through quantum fluctuations ( loop corrections ) .",
    "deviations from the sm predictions can therefore supply indirect information about new undiscovered particles or interactions .",
    "the recent measurement of the muon anomalous magnetic moment @xmath2 at bnl  @xcite reported a new world average showing a discrepancy at the @xmath3 standard deviation level with respect to the theoretical sm evaluation of the same quantity which has been taken as an indication of new physics .",
    "for the correct interpretation of experimental data the appropriate inclusion of higher order effects as well as a very precise knowledge of the sm input parameters is required .",
    "the bnl experiment plans a new measurement with an accuracy three times smaller which will challenge even more the theoretical predictions .",
    "one of the main ingredients of the theoretical prediction for the muon anomalous magnetic moment is the hadronic vacuum polarization contribution which moreover is responsible for the bulk of the theoretical error .",
    "this quantity plays also an important role in the evolution of the electromagnetic coupling @xmath4 from the low energy thompson limit to high energies . in both cases",
    "the precise knowledge of the ratio @xmath5 over a wide range of energies is required .",
    "the measurement of the hadronic cross section in @xmath0 annihilation to an accuracy better than @xmath6 in the energy range below @xmath7  gev is necessary to improve the accuracy of the present predictions for the muon anomalous magnetic moment and the qed coupling .    in this paper , the radiative return method",
    "is motivated and described .",
    "it has the advantage against the conventional energy scan  @xcite , that the systematics of the measurement ( e.g. normalization , beam energy ) have to be taken into account only once but not for each individual energy point independently .",
    "an improved monte carlo generator which simulates the radiative process @xmath8 at the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) accuracy is presented .",
    "finally , the analysis is extended to the description of events with hard photons radiated at very small angle .",
    "the standard model prediction for the muon anomalous magnetic moment consist of three contributions   @xmath9 the qed correction , known ( estimated ) up to five loops  @xcite , gives the main contribution ( see table  [ tab : amu ] for numerical values  ) .",
    "the weak contribution is currently known up to two loops  @xcite . finally , the hadronic contribution consist of three different terms where the leading one comes from the vacuum polarization diagram in figure  [ fig : muon ] which furthermore is responsible for the bulk of the theoretical uncertainty .",
    ".qed , hadronic and weak contributions to the muon anomalous magnetic moment . [ cols=\"<,>,>,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the radiative process @xmath10 , where the photon is radiated from the initial particles ( initial state radiation , isr ) , see figure  [ fig : isrfsr ] , can be used to measure the hadronic cross section @xmath11 at high luminosity electron - positron storage rings , like the @xmath12-factory daphne or at @xmath13-factories , over a wide range of energies .",
    "the radiated photon reduces the effective energy of the collision and thus the invariant mass of the hadronic system .",
    "this possibility has been proposed and studied in detail in  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) . a monte carlo generator called eva  @xcite which simulates the process @xmath14 was built .",
    "the four pion channel was considered in  @xcite .",
    "radiation of photons from the hadronic system ( final state radiation , fsr ) should be considered as the background of the measurement .",
    "one of the main issues of the radiative return method is the suppression of this kind of events by choosing suitable kinematical cuts . from eva studies",
    "this is achieved by selecting events with the tagged photons close to the beam axis and well separated from the hadrons which reduces fsr to a reasonable limit .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : eva ] .",
    "furthermore , the suppression of fsr overcomes the problem of its model dependence which should be taken into account in a completely inclusive measurement  @xcite .",
    "preliminary experimental results using the radiative return method have been presented recently by the kloe collaboration  @xcite .",
    "large event rates were also observed at babar  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical description of the radiative events under consideration to a precision better than @xmath6 requires a precise control of higher order radiative corrections .",
    "the next sections are devoted to the calculation of the nlo corrections to isr and its inclusion in a new improved monte carlo generator  @xcite .",
    "at nlo , the @xmath0 annihilation process @xmath15 where the virtual photon decays into a hadronic final state , @xmath16 hadrons , and the real one is emitted from the initial electron or positron , receives contributions from one - loop corrections and from the emission of a second real photon ( see figure  [ fig : nlo ] for a schematic representation ) .    the calculation of the different contributions proceeds as follows : first the one - loop diagrams are reduced , using the standard passarino - veltman procedure  @xcite , to the calculation of a few one - loop scalar integrals which are calculated in @xmath17 dimensions in order to regularize their divergences .",
    "the interference with the lowest order feynman diagrams is calculated and the ultraviolet ( uv ) divergences are renormalized using the on - shell mass scheme .",
    "the remaining infrared ( ir ) divergences are cancelled by adding the soft contribution of the second photon calculated analytically by integration in phase space up to a soft energy cutoff @xmath18 far below the center of mass energy @xmath19 .    in order to facilitate the extension of the monte carlo simulation to different hadronic exclusive channels the differential rate is cast into the product of a leptonic and a hadronic tensor and the corresponding factorized phase space @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the hadronic @xmath22-body phase - space including all statistical factors and @xmath23 is the invariant mass of the hadronic system .",
    "the physics of the hadronic system , whose description is model dependent , enters only through the hadronic tensor @xmath24 .",
    "the leptonic tensor which describes the next - to - leading order virtual and soft qed corrections to initial state radiation in @xmath0 annihilation has the following general form : @xmath25~ , \\label{generaltensor}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 with @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) the four momentum of the positron ( electron ) .",
    "the scalar coefficients @xmath29 and @xmath30 allow the following expansion @xmath31 where @xmath32 give the lo contribution .",
    "the nlo coefficients @xmath33 and @xmath34 were calculated in  @xcite for the case where the observed photon is far from the collinear region .",
    "the extension of these results to the forward and backward regions is commented in section  [ sec : untagged ] .    finally , the contribution from radiation of two real hard photons , @xmath35 , is calculated numerically using the helicity amplitude method  @xcite .",
    "the sum of the virtual plus soft corrections to one single photon events and the hard contribution of two photon emission gives the final result at nlo which is independent of the soft photon cutoff @xmath36 .",
    "a monte carlo generator has been built which simulates the production of two charged pions together with one or two hard photons and includes virtual and soft photon corrections to the emission of one single real photon .",
    "it supersedes the previous versions of the eva  @xcite monte carlo .",
    "again the program exhibits a modular structure which preserves the factorization of the initial state qed corrections .",
    "the simulation of other exclusive hadronic channels can , therefore , be easily included with the simple replacement of the current(s ) of the existing modes , and the corresponding multi - particle hadronic phase space .",
    "the simulation of the four pion channel  @xcite will be incorporated soon as well as other multi - hadron final states .",
    "our results will be presented in  @xcite .",
    "from the experimental point of view it would be much easier to perform the analysis with no lower photon angular boundary .",
    "the cross section in the forward and backward regions grows very fast and therefore a small deviation in the determination of the photon angle could introduce a large error .",
    "it turns out that further advantages appear if only an upper cut on the photon angle is imposed .",
    "the cross section is thus larger .",
    "for instance , the cross section for radiative events with @xmath37 and @xmath38 is 4 times bigger than the corresponding cross section for @xmath39 .",
    "furthermore , since fsr is isotropic with respect to the beam axis its contribution does not change much and , as a result , its relative importance with respect to isr is much smaller ( see lower line in figure  [ fig : eva ] ) .",
    "all together may provide a better control of the systematics of the measurement and , therefore , a better determination of the hadronic cross section .    it should be point out that in the forward and backward regions some corrections of order @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the electron mass , has to be taken into account even though @xmath40 is a small quantity . at lo ,",
    "the full leptonic tensor is given by : @xmath42~ ,   \\label{lmunu0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "expressing the bilinear products @xmath46 by the photon emission angle in the center of mass frame @xmath47 the electron mass enters twofold . through @xmath46 , @xmath48 , but also quadratically in terms of the type @xmath49 . in the former case",
    ", the electron mass regulates the collinear divergences of the cross section .",
    "the second kind of contributions gives only finite corrections which , nevertheless , can be sizeable . in both cases",
    "the electron mass plays a relevant role only when the photon is emitted at very small angles .",
    "otherwise , the limit @xmath50 can be taken safely .    to illustrate this point the differential cross section for the process @xmath14 at @xmath51  gev is presented in figure  [ fig : less ] .",
    "the pion and photon angles are integrated without applying any angular cut .",
    "the electron mass is kept in the scalar bilinears @xmath46 but the quadratic terms are considered or not to show their effect . both results are compared in the small insert of this figure with the known corresponding analytical differential distribution @xmath52 with the substitution @xmath53 @xmath54 for the two pion exclusive channel , being @xmath55 the pion form factor . in ( [ diff1 ] )",
    "the expansion in the electron mass has been performed after integration .",
    "figure  [ fig : less ] shows thus the good performance of the monte carlo integration also at very small photon angles .",
    "the analytical result agrees with the monte carlo integration when the full electron mass dependence is considered in  eq.([lmunu0 ] ) .",
    "if the quadratic mass terms are not taken into account a deviation of up to @xmath56 is found .",
    "in contrast , at higher energies these corrections are quite suppressed , less than 1 per mil at @xmath57  gev .",
    "figure  [ fig : smallangles ] shows the effect of the electron mass corrections for different angular cuts at @xmath51  gev .",
    "up to @xmath58 deviation with respect to the full result is found which nevertheless decreases quite steeply if the collinear region is excluded : to less than 5 per mil for tagged photon events at @xmath59 degree minimal angle .",
    "these electron mass finite corrections , which are relevant only in the very forward and backward regions , below 1 degree at @xmath51  gev , have been included in the new version of the eva monte carlo . at present , only at lo . at nlo , the corresponding electron mass corrections to the virtual and soft contributions in one photon events",
    "are included in the definition of the @xmath46 s while the quadratic terms will be included soon .",
    "for two photon events the full electron mass dependence is already considered .",
    "the radiative return method is a competitive method to measure the hadronic cross section at high luminosity @xmath0 colliders ( @xmath12 and @xmath13-factories ) giving access to a wide range of energies , from threshold to the center of mass energy of the collider .",
    "a monte carlo generator has been built which simulates the production of two charged pions together with one or two hard photons and includes virtual and soft photon corrections to the emission of one single real photon .",
    "its modular structure is such that the simulation of other exclusive hadronic channels can be easily included .",
    "the description of events with hard photons radiated at very small angle has been also investigated .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank the organizers of this meeting for the stimulating atmosphere created during the school and the katowice group for his kind hospitality .",
