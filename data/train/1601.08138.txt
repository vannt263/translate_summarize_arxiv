    "since 2004 november , the burst alert telescope ( bat , @xcite ) on board the swift observatory @xcite has been scanning the entire sky in the hard x - ray domain ( 15150 kev ) recording timing and spectral information for any detected source ( more than 1700 sources after 100 months of survey ) . thanks to its wide field of view and to the swift pointing strategy , the bat observes daily @xmath5 of the sky , and therefore it is specially fit for source variability studies .",
    "bat has proved to be a valuable tool to detect transient phenomena from known and unknown sources @xcite and , by combining the entire data span , to reveal long periodicities of galactic high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxb , e.g. @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we present a comprehensive temporal and spectral analysis of the swift data collected on igr  j19149 + 1036 .",
    "this source was detected by ibis / isgri at a position consistent with the einstein source 2e  1912.5 + 1031 @xcite , although a firm association was not possible due to large systematic uncertainties related to the presence of grs 1915 + 105 at a distance lower than @xmath6 .",
    "the source was also detected by jem - x with a 3 - 10 kev x - ray flux of @xmath7 .",
    "the field around igr  j19149 + 1036 was observed by swift / xrt several times .",
    "the analysis of the xrt data collected on 2010 dec . 5 and 2011 feb .",
    "17 , reported in @xcite , allowed to estimate a refined source position at ra = 19h14m56.73s and dec = + 10deg 36 38.11  ( j2000 ) , with an associated uncertainty of 3.7 arcsec , that confirmed the association with 2e  1912.5 + 1031 suggested by @xcite .",
    "the xrt spectrum was modeled by an absorbed power - law with a column density n@xmath8 and a photon index @xmath9 , with an observed 1 - 10 kev x - ray flux of @xmath10 .",
    "2mass  j19145680 + 1036387 ( j=14.34 , h=12.41 , k=11.53 ) , within the xrt error circle , is the most likely counterpart to igr  j19149 + 1036 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the bat and xrt data reduction .",
    "section 3 reports on the timing analysis .",
    "section 4 describes the broad band spectral analysis . in section 5",
    "we briefly discuss our results .",
    "the results reported in this paper on igr  j19149 + 1036 derive from the analysis of the bat survey data relevant to the first 103 months of the swift mission .",
    "the data were retrieved from the swift public archive in the form of detector plane histograms ( dph ) : three - dimensional arrays ( two spatial dimensions , one spectral dimension ) that collect count - rate data in 5-min time bins for 80 energy channels .",
    "we use a dedicated software @xcite to process these data , producing all - sky maps in several energy intervals between 15 and 150 kev , detecting sources on these maps and extracting , for each source , standard products such as light curves and spectra .",
    "figure  [ map ] ( top panel ) shows the 15 - 150 kev significance sky map ( exposure time 39.4 ms ) in the direction of igr j19149 + 1036 .",
    "the source is close ( @xmath1120 arcmin ) to the much brighter object grs 1915 + 105 : the positions of these two sources are marked with black crosses . in this map igr j19149",
    "+ 1036 is not immediately detected because it is embedded in the psf signal of the close brighter source . however , if we extract the values of the significance along the line that connects the optical position of the two surces ( magenta line in top panel of figure  [ map ] ) we observe an asymmetric profile ( figure  [ map ] , central panel ) that suggests the presence of a faint source ( igr j19149 + 1036 ) hidden by the psf of the brighter one ( grs 1915 + 105 ) .",
    "indeed , the fit of this profile with a single gaussian shows systematic residuals ; conversely , the profile is well fitted with a double gaussian .",
    "the best fit peaks of the two gaussians correspond to the position of the two sources . in order to make igr j19149 + 1036 emerge in the sky map",
    ", we perform on each dph a subtraction of the expected illumination pattern from all the detected sources ; from the resulting `` residual shadowgrams '' we generate new survey `` residual maps '' where any previously undetected source can emerge .",
    "igr  j19149 + 1036 was detected in the 15150 kev all - sky `` residual map '' ( fig .",
    "1 , bottom panel ) with a signal to noise ratio of 28.6 standard deviations and of 31.7 standard deviations in the 1560 kev all - sky map , where its signal - to - noise is maximized . the 1560 kev energy band was used to extract the light curve with the maximum resolution ( @xmath12 s ) allowed by the swift - bat survey data . for each time",
    "bin the contribution from grs 1915 + 105 is subtracted .",
    "the time tag of each bin , defined as the central time of the bin interval , was corrected to the solar system barycenter ( ssb ) by using the task earth2sun .",
    "the background subtracted spectrum averaged over the entire survey period was extracted in 14 energy channels and analyzed using the bat redistribution matrix available in the swift calibration database .",
    "swift - xrt @xcite observed the field around igr  j19149 + 1036 5 times after the discovery of the source by integral .",
    "the source was always observed in photon counting ( pc ) mode @xcite for a total exposure of @xmath113800 s. the details on the five swift - xrt observations are reported in table  [ log ] .",
    "the xrt data were processed with standard procedures ( xrtpipeline v.0.12.8 ) using the ftools in the heasoft package ( v 6.15 ) and the products were extracted adopting a grade filtering of 0 - 12 .",
    "the source events for timing and spectral analysis were extracted from a circular region of 20 pixel radius ( 1 pixel = 2.36  ) centered on the source position as determined with xrtcentroid ( ra= 19h14m56.8s and dec = + 10deg 36 39.1  , j2000 ) , while the background was extracted from an annular region centered on the source , with an inner radius of 60 pixels and an outer radius of 90 pixels that avoids contamination due to the stray ",
    "light from grs  j1915 + 105 and to the psf tail of igr  j19149 + 1036 .",
    "all source event arrival times were converted to the ssb with the task barycorr .",
    "ancillary response files were generated with xrtmkarf .",
    "we also extracted a single source and a single background spectra from the 5 xrt observations and combined the relevant ancillary files using addarf , that weights them by the exposure times of the corresponding source spectra .",
    "finally , the spectra were re - binned with a minimum of 20 counts per energy channel . this lower limit of counts per bin is enough to ensure that the deviation of the observed number of counts from the expected values approximates quite well a gaussian distribution , that is a requirement to apply the @xmath13 statistics .",
    "we used the spectral redistribution matrix v014 and the spectral analysis was performed using xspec v.12.5 .",
    "errors are at 90% confidence level for a single parameter , if not stated otherwise .",

    "we have analyzed the swift - bat and xrt data relevant to the hmxb igr  j19149 + 1036 .",
    "the source is close ( @xmath1120 arcmin ) to the much brighter source grs 1915 + 105 , and an ad hoc imaging analysis was necessary to reveal it in the bat all sky map , where it emerges at a significance level of @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) standard deviations in the 15150 kev ( 1560 kev ) band after 103 months of the swift mission .",
    "the timing analysis on the long term bat light curve unveils the presence of a periodic modulation in the hard x - ray emission with a period of p@xmath16 days .",
    "we interpret this modulation as the orbital period of the binary system .",
    "the folded light curve is characterized by a single symmetric peak with a roughly sinusoidal shape that shows a minimum consistent with zero intensity , lasting @xmath0 per cent of the orbital period .",
    "such a long minimum intensity phase interval is difficult to explain with a full eclipse of the compact object , unless we speculate that the system has both an extremely eccentric orbit and a high inclination angle .",
    "an alternative explanation is that the modulation is caused by the passage of the compact source through the stellar wind , whose density decreases as the source approaches the orbit apastron . however , no definite conclusion on the geometry of the binary system can be drawn , without knowing the spectral type of the companion star .",
    "the broad band spectrum can not be adequately described by the standard continua used for hmxb , because of the presence of an absorption feature within the bat energy range .",
    "we obtain a good description of the data introducing a cyclotron line in the cutoff power law model .",
    "the energy of the cutoff is @xmath17 kev and the line is centered at e@xmath18 kev .",
    "the presence of absorption cyclotron lines has been revealed in several hmxb .",
    "they are thought to be originated near the magnetic poles of the neutron star due to resonant scattering processes of the x - rays by electrons whose kinetic energies are quantized in discrete landau energy levels perpendicular to the b - field @xcite .",
    "their energy centroid is related to the intensity of the magnetic field of the neutron star : @xmath19    if the cyclotron absorption takes place near the poles of the neutron star the observed resonance energy shall be corrected by the effect of the gravitational redshift : @xmath20 = @xmath21 with    @xmath22    using standard parameters for the neutron star ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 cm ) , the magnetic field at the neutron star surface would be b@xmath25 gauss .",
    "this result is fully consistent with the distribution of the magnetic field values derived for neutron stars in binary systems , that peaks in the range @xmath26 g @xcite .",
