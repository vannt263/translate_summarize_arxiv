    "<S> we study the effect of the transverse degrees of freedom on the velocity of sound in a bose - einstein condensate immersed in a one - dimensional optical lattice and radially confined by a harmonic trap . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the results of full three - dimensional calculations with those of an effective 1d model based on the equation of state of the condensate . </S>",
    "<S> the perfect agreement between the two approaches is demonstrated for several optical lattice depths and throughout the full crossover from the 1d mean - field to the thomas fermi regime in the radial direction .    </S>",
    "<S> ever since the achievement of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) with atomic vapors , an extensive activity in the study of the excitations of these systems has been carried out . </S>",
    "<S> a particular example is the exploration of sound excitations in elongated condensates @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the propagation of sound in one - dimensional ( 1d ) optical lattices has been the subject of recent studies performed both in the linear @xcite and nonlinear regimes @xcite . to capture the main physics , </S>",
    "<S> the system can be conveniently described by means of effective 1d theories , which account for the transverse degrees of freedom through a renormalization of the coupling constant . </S>",
    "<S> still , it is important to check the effect of the transverse degrees of freedom since they are known to play a relevant role in some cases @xcite .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we show that the sound velocity in presence of a 1d lattice and transverse harmonic confinement can be obtained by employing an effective 1d approach , and demonstrate that the effect of the transverse harmonic confinement is completely accounted for by the expression @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the number of atoms per lattice well and @xmath2 is the effective mass . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of lattice and transverse confinement both on the equation of state @xmath3 and @xmath2 is discussed in detail .    </S>",
    "<S> let us consider an axially symmetric condensate , which is radially confined by the potential @xmath4 , and immersed in a 1d periodic potential of the form @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the lattice period , @xmath7 the recoil energy , @xmath8 the bragg - momentum , and @xmath9 the lattice depth in units of the recoil energy . </S>",
    "<S> we consider any additional axial confinement to be negligible , so that the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation takes the form @xmath10\\psi(r , z)= { \\mu } \\psi(r , z)\\ , , \\label{gpe-3d }     \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the number of atoms per lattice well and the condensate wavefunction is normalized according to @xmath11 $ ] , where the functions @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the bogoliubov quasiparticle amplitudes of quasimomentum @xmath14 , and quantum numbers @xmath15 representing the band index and the number of radial nodes respectively . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the lowest energy solutions , with @xmath16 and @xmath17 , are axial phonons that propagate with the sound velocity @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is defined as the slope of the lowest branch in the excitation spectrum @xmath19 , through the relation @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore it can be obtained by numerically solving the spectrum of the full 3d system , as discussed in @xcite .    in the following </S>",
    "<S> we will show that the system can be equivalently described by an effective 1d approach . </S>",
    "<S> the basic assumption we make is that the condensate wavefunction can be factorised into a longitudinal and a radial part @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> the physics underlying this assumption is that interactions mainly affect the radial wavefunction @xmath22 , while the axial wavefunction @xmath23 is that of a single particle in the periodic potential . </S>",
    "<S> this factorization is exact for @xmath24 , where the system is uniform in the longitudinal direction . in the case </S>",
    "<S> @xmath25 , the solution of the gp equation for a transversally uniform system shows that for the densities of many current experiments @xcite the equation of state and the effective mass can be calculated neglecting the density dependence of @xmath23 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining relevant density dependence of these quantities arises from their explicit dependence on the number of particles ( see below ) . </S>",
    "<S> the range of densities for which the factorization ansatz is correct becomes larger as the lattice depth @xmath9 is increased .    under the factorization assumption , and using the normalisation condition for the wavefunction , one can write two effective gp equations @xmath26\\varphi(r)= \\mu_\\perp \\varphi(r ) , \\;\\;\\;\\ ; \\label{gpe - r }   \\\\ & & \\bigg [ - { \\hbar^2 \\over 2 m } \\nabla_z^2 + v_{\\rm lat}(z ) + \\left ( g \\int |\\varphi(r)|^4 d^2 r \\right ) n |\\psi(z)|^2 \\bigg]\\psi(z)= \\mu_z \\psi(z ) , \\;\\;\\;\\ ; \\label{gpe - z } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the number of particles in each well at equilibrium , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , being @xmath29\\varphi(r)$ ] and @xmath30 the single particle ground state energy of the periodic potential .    </S>",
    "<S> the effective mass is calculated from the lowest energy bloch band    @xmath31   \\psi_{k}(z ) dz , \\label{energy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    according to the general relation @xmath32 @xcite . in eq.([energy ] ) the explicit dependence of the energy per particle on density appears through the renormalized number of atoms @xmath33 , where @xmath34 . consistently with the above discussion , the bloch state @xmath35 at quasi - momentum @xmath36 is taken as the single particle solution of ( [ gpe - z ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> then @xmath35 is independent of the radial confinement and the effect of the radial trapping on @xmath2 is captured by its dependence on the renormalized number of atoms @xmath37 .    </S>",
    "<S> equation  ( [ gpe - r ] ) describes a bec uniform along @xmath38 and harmonically confined along @xmath39 ( infinite cylinder ) . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the lattice is included in the effective coupling constant @xmath40 where again @xmath23 is the single particle ground state of ( [ gpe - z ] ) . without radial confinement , in a system with 3d average density @xmath41 , </S>",
    "<S> the equation of state @xmath42 is linear in the density , since @xmath43 depends strongly on the optical lattice depth , but not on density . </S>",
    "<S> as mentioned above , this result is known to be correct in the presence of a lattice for sufficiently small densities @xcite .    in order to discuss the effect of the transverse degrees of freedom , we concentrate now on the radial dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of the lattice is described by the effective coupling constant @xmath43 , so that the crossover from frozen radial dynamics ( 1d mean - field ) to the thomas - fermi ( tf ) regime , can be described in full analogy to the case of the infinite cylinder @xcite . introducing the dimensionless variable @xmath44 and defining @xmath45 , eq.([gpe - r ] ) </S>",
    "<S> can be rewritten in the dimensionless form    @xmath46 f(\\rho ) = { \\mu_\\perp\\over\\hbar\\omega_\\perp}f(\\rho)\\ , , \\label{gpe-1d}\\ ] ]    where @xmath47 is the linear average density , @xmath48 is the effective scattering length obtained from the relation @xmath49 , and @xmath50 is normalized according to @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> notice that the solution of the above equation depends only on the parameter @xmath52 , yielding an exact scaling behavior for the radial wavefunction as a function of the transverse trapping .    </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of the chemical potential @xmath53 on @xmath54 determines the equation of state in the presence of the radial trap . for @xmath55 , </S>",
    "<S> the system is in the tf regime and one finds @xmath56 . in the opposite limit @xmath57 , instead , the radial profile is gaussian and the equation of state is given by @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> given the solution @xmath53 as a function of the universal parameter @xmath54 , the velocity of sound can be calculated according to eq.([sound_vel ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this procedure yields the result @xmath59 both in the tf regime ( @xmath55 ) and in the 1d mean - field limit ( @xmath57 ) @xcite . to find these limiting results </S>",
    "<S> , we have used the fact that @xmath60 in the tf regime and @xmath61 in the 1d mean - field limit .    </S>",
    "<S> the result for the sound velocity in the intermediate regimes can be calculated numerically , just based on the knowledge of the following quantities : ( i ) the renormalized scattering length @xmath48 for any given value of @xmath9 , obtained from a 1d calculation of the single particle ground state solution in presence of the lattice ; ( ii ) the equation of state and @xmath37 for the infinite cylinder at any @xmath52 ; ( iii ) the effective mass @xmath2 at any given value of @xmath9 for the renormalised number of atoms per well @xmath37 , obtained from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ energy ] ) by a 1d calculation of the single particle bloch solutions . </S>",
    "<S> this procedure leads to the results shown in fig.[fig ] , where the theoretical predictions are compared with the results of the full 3d numerical calculations for several values of the lattice depth . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement is perfect in the full crossover .    </S>",
    "<S> , for three values of the lattice depth ( from top to bottom @xmath62 ) . results of full 3d numerical calculations ( points ) are compared with the prediction derived from the 1d equation of state ( lines ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath63 and @xmath64 for @xmath65 and @xmath66 respectively.,height=240 ]    furthermore , it is interesting to note that by relating @xmath67 to the density at the center @xmath68 one can show that the value @xmath69 provides an estimate for the sound velocity which is correct within @xmath70 throughout the whole crossover from tf to 1d .    </S>",
    "<S> we also notice that in the tf regime , @xmath71 , the sound velocity in presence of transverse harmonic confinement corresponds to that of a transversally uniform condensate with the average density @xmath72 , @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , in this regime the radial profile is an inverted parabola , leading to an average density @xmath74 equal to half of the central density @xmath68 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this explanation in terms of @xmath75 works well in the tf regime , and to some extent also in the 1d mean - field regime , where the definition for the average density is replaced by @xmath76 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , since the concept of average density is not well defined in general , it does not provide a general criterion for the determination of the sound velocity in the intermediate regimes .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have demonstrated that the equation of state of an infinite cylinder captures the effect of the transverse degrees of freedom on the sound velocity in a condensate immersed in a 1d optical lattice , upon a suitable renormalization of the mass and of the coupling constant . </S>",
    "<S> this result is obtained by means of a factorization ansatz for the condensate wavefunction . </S>",
    "<S> the predictions of the factorized model yield perfect agreement with full 3d numerical calculations in a wide range of optical lattice depths and in the full crossover from the 1d mean field regime to the tf limit . </S>",
    "<S> the factorization ansatz rely on the assumption that in absence of radial trapping the equation of state is linear in the number of particles . </S>",
    "<S> this condition is always fulfilled at @xmath24 and in the tight binding regime , while for intermediate @xmath9 it is satisfied to a good approximation at experimentally relevant densities . in any case , </S>",
    "<S> eq.([sound_vel ] ) is completely general , and could be easily checked also beyond the limit of validity of the factorization ansatz . in that case </S>",
    "<S> the determination of @xmath3 would require from the beginning a full 3d calculation . instead , </S>",
    "<S> when the factorization assumption holds , the simple model presented in this paper can be used to extract the correct value of the sound velocity . </S>"
