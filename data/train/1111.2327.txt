    "high - precision data from lattice simulations are a key ingredient in our understanding of the low - energy aspects of yang - mills theories associated with color confinement .",
    "in fact , whereas new insight into the confinement mechanism may be gained by investigating the properties of gauge - field configurations produced in the simulations ( see e.g.@xcite ) , specific features of proposed confinement scenarios may be tested by comparison with lattice data . in this case",
    ", one may obtain physical values for a model s parameters by fitting the predicted expression of a given observable to its numerical realization .",
    "one may also hope to over - constrain the proposed analytic forms , if the fits can be done with sufficiently high number and wide range of data points , from which systematic errors have been consistently eliminated .",
    "in particular , this applies to predictions for the infrared behavior of gluon and ghost propagators , formulated in landau gauge for su(@xmath3 ) gauge theory .",
    "here we perform a series of fits to the gluon propagator @xmath0 and test the predictions of the so - called refined gribov - zwanziger ( rgz ) framework , which differs from the scenario originally proposed by gribov @xcite and zwanziger @xcite through the introduction of dimension - two condensates , associated with dynamical mass generation @xcite .",
    "our analysis is done for pure su(2 ) gauge theory .",
    "the data have been produced previously and discussed in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , but they have not been systematically fitted until now .",
    "a companion paper with similar fits for the ghost propagator is under way @xcite .",
    "we note that an alternative comparison of these data to analytic predictions was recently presented in @xcite .",
    "the gribov - zwanziger confinement scenario is based on restricting the functional integration to the first gribov region @xmath4 delimited by the first gribov horizon @xmath5 , where the smallest nonzero ( and positive ) eigenvalue of the faddeev - popov matrix @xmath6 goes to zero @xcite .",
    "let us recall that limiting the gauge configurations to this region was an attempt  made by gribov in ref .",
    "@xcite  to fix the gauge completely , getting rid of spurious gauge copies , known thereafter as gribov copies .",
    "now , @xmath4 is a convex region of very high dimensionality and therefore , as the infinite - volume limit is approached , the increase in entropy should favor @xcite gauge configurations on the surface @xmath5 .",
    "this in turn can cause the infrared enhancement of the ghost propagator ( which is related to the inverse of @xmath6 ) , inducing long - range effects in the theory .",
    "indeed , in coulomb gauge , the restriction to the first gribov region causes the appearance of a confining color - coulomb potential @xcite .",
    "thus , in this scenario , formulated for momentum - space propagators , the long - range features needed to explain the color - confinement mechanism are manifest in the ghost propagator , whereas the momentum - space gluon propagator @xmath0 should be _ suppressed _ in the infrared limit .",
    "such a suppression is associated with violation of spectral positivity , which is commonly interpreted as gluon confinement @xcite . in particular , @xmath7 is originally expected to be zero @xcite , corresponding to maximal violation of spectral positivity .",
    "the parametrization of this behavior as a propagator having a pair of poles with purely imaginary masses has arisen in the gribov - zwanziger approach @xcite , in connection with the study of gauge copies .",
    "lattice studies ( see @xcite for a recent review ) have confirmed the suppression of the gluon propagator in the infrared limit and the enhancement of the ghost propagator at intermediate momenta . however , considering lattice sizes large enough to allow the investigation of the deep infrared regime , it is clear that the results of the simulations are _ not _ compatible with the scenario described above . indeed  in space - time dimension d = 3 , 4  the gluon propagator shows a finite value as the momentum is taken to zero and the enhancement of the ghost propagator is lost in this limit .",
    "we note the very large lattice sizes employed in order to observe such a behavior , @xmath8 fm and larger @xcite . in any case ,",
    "violation of reflection positivity for the real - space gluon propagator ( see e.g.  @xcite ) is clearly observed in the data .",
    "recently , the quantitative description of the massive behavior for the gluon propagator has been studied by several groups @xcite , based on different proposed analytic forms .",
    "earlier attempts of fitting gluon - propagator data can be found for example in refs .",
    "we note that some of these studies ( see e.g.@xcite ) have considered the so - called gribov - stingl form @xcite for modeling the massive behavior of the gluon propagator .",
    "this form is a generalization of the gribov propagator described above , including pairs of complex - conjugate poles with a nonzero real part . as illustrated below",
    ", the behavior predicted for @xmath0 in the rgz framework is also based on general complex - conjugate poles for the ( massive ) propagator .",
    "this proposed form is given for su(@xmath3 ) gauge theory and for four or three space - time dimensions @xcite . on the contrary , in the 2d case , the rgz approach can not be implemented , since the dimension - two condensates would induce severe infrared singularities , precluding the restriction of the functional integration to the first gribov region @xcite . by fitting rational functions of @xmath9 to the _ whole _ range of data for the su(2 ) gluon propagator ,",
    "we are able to obtain estimates for the physical values of the masses in the rgz framework , as well as to gain a better understanding of the pole structure in the proposed expressions . in each case , we look for the best fit to the data , with the smallest number of independent parameters , and relate them to the condensates in the proposed analytic forms only at the end . put differently , the predicted dependence of the fit parameters on the condensates is _ not _ imposed in the fitting form , but is obtained as a result of the fit .",
    "this allows us to use a wide fitting range , considering all data points .",
    "we note that predictions from the rgz framework were already tested in @xcite , showing good fits ( using a somewhat different analytic form and a smaller fitting range ) to 4d lattice data for the su(3 ) case .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the gribov - zwanziger scenario is briefly reviewed in section [ sec : gz ] .",
    "the introduction of condensates as part of the rgz scenario is summarized is section [ sec : rgz ] , where we present the expressions to be fitted to the lattice data .",

    "( [ eq : z ] ) .",
    "this condition is a consequence of the restriction of the path integral to the first gribov region .    as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "one of the main outcomes of the gz theory is the modification of the behavior of gluon and ghost propagators in the infrared ( ir ) limit in comparison with the perturbative behavior @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "indeed , the gluon propagator becomes ir - suppressed with a tree - level behavior given by @xmath41 this result is confirmed by one - loop calculations @xcite .",
    "the above expression for the gluon propagator implies that @xmath0 is null at zero momentum , which in turn indicates maximal violation of reflection positivity for the real - space gluon propagator @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "this violation is usually considered a manifestation of gluon confinement @xcite . at the same time , one finds that the ghost propagator displays an enhanced ir behavior @xmath43 this behavior is indicative of a long - range interaction in the theory and it should be related to quark confinement @xcite .",
    "more recently , the gz action has been `` refined '' by taking into account the possible existence of dimension - two condensates @xcite . in the most general case @xcite , four different condensates are considered , i.e.@xmath44 where we have listed the dynamical mass associated to each condensate .",

    ", there is clear evidence that the original gz theory dynamically transforms into the refined theory , since the minimum of the associated effective potential favors non - vanishing condensates @xcite .",
    "as displayed below , a non - zero value for these condensates has an effect on the ir behavior of gluon propagators .",
    "the effect on the ghost propagator will be discussed in a forthcoming work @xcite .      in the presence of the four condensates considered in eq.([eq : condensates ] ) , the gz gluon propagator ( [ gluonprop2 ] ) is modified @xcite as @xmath49 where the condensates @xmath50 , @xmath47 , @xmath45 are described above and @xmath51 is related to the gribov parameter @xmath23 through @xmath52 . since @xmath45 and @xmath53 are complex - conjugate quantities , we can set @xmath54 and rewrite eq .",

    "( we recall that a gribov propagator would have a null real part . )",
    "note also that the mass and the coefficient associated with the real pole in 3d are very small .    in the 2d case ,",
    "two particular features arise in the analysis of the data .",
    "firstly , as known from previous lattice studies , the description of the infrared behavior of the gluon propagator @xmath0 requires a non - integer power @xmath165 of the momentum @xmath1 .",
    "[ see the fitting form @xmath153 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : f2dgluon ] ) and fit parameters obtained using improved momenta in table [ tab : gluon2d - im ] . ] secondly , the pole structure that best fits the data is similar to the one observed in the 3d and 4d cases  i.e.  complex - conjugate poles with nonzero real part  at all considered ( finite ) lattice volumes . in the infinite - volume limit , one finds @xmath166 , as would be the case for a gribov propagator , with purely imaginary poles .",
    "however , in our case , the real part of the poles does not seem to vanish in this limit .",
    "the null value of @xmath7 comes , instead , from an exact cancellation of the contributions from the two complex - conjugate poles ( see values of pole masses in table [ tab : gluon2d - param ] ) .",
    "our analysis strongly suggests  in d = 2 , 3 , 4  a pole structure with complex - conjugate masses ( with comparable real and imaginary parts ) for the infrared gluon propagator in landau gauge .. ] as stressed at the end of section [ sec : rgzgluon ] , one can interpret this result as describing an unstable particle @xcite .",
    "in particular , by considering the position @xmath167 of the gluon pole , one can evaluate the gluon mass @xmath168 and its width @xmath169 , which are in principle gauge - independent quantities @xcite . in our case , if we take as a reference the pole masses in the 4d case  i.e.  the values @xmath170 with @xmath171 gev@xmath172 and @xmath173 gev@xmath172 from table [ tab : gluon4d - param ]  we obtain @xmath174 note that the value for the gluon mass @xmath168 is in agreement with other determinations @xcite .",
    ", the maximum wavelength of ( confined ) gluons , roughly corresponding to the inverse gluon mass @xmath175 .",
    "] at the same time , the very large value for the width @xmath169 would correspond to a lifetime @xmath176 smaller than 10@xmath177 s , supporting the existence of very short - lived excitations of the gluon field .    in summary",
    ", we have presented fits  inspired by a renormalizable action  allowing a good description of lattice data for the landau - gauge su(2 ) gluon propagator @xmath0 . the data points range from about 4 gev down to 2040 mev , which are the smallest simulated momenta to date .",
    "our results thus provide an accurate modeling of @xmath0 in the whole ir region , which will hopefully be a useful input in general studies of the ir sector of yang - mills theories .",
