    "the cs terms violate the parity symmetry . in previous works ,",
    "electromagnetic and gravitational fields have mainly been investigated.@xcite in this paper , we discuss the effect of the symmetry breaking terms on fluid flow under the cs modified theories .",
    "this paper focuses on conserved quantities of fluid . for its discussion ,",
    "it is useful to adopt the lagrangian description,@xcite in which each fluid particle is assigned a label , i.e. , lagrangian coordinates at the initial time . in the lagrangian coordinates , mass evaluated in a closed region is conserved under time evolution .",
    "similarly , for perfect fluid , circulation is also conserved .",
    "these facts are valid even when we take account of general relativity.@xcite furthermore , we can encounter other conserved quantities , e.g. , fluid helicity,@xcite magnetic helicity and cross helicity.@xcite the last two quantities are considered for fluid interacting with electromagnetic fields . in this paper , we deal with the above - mentioned conserved quantities within a general relativistic framework and take account of the corrections induced by the cs modified theories .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : cs - maxwell ] , we consider fluid flow interacting with electromagnetic fields under the cs modified maxwell theory . utilizing the lagrangian description , we discuss the conservation of mass ( or energy ) , circulation , and fluid helicity .",
