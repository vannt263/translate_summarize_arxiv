    "when @xmath53 is odd , @xmath284 is nonempty and @xmath285 is empty .",
    "furthermore , the sign of the derivatives of @xmath300 and @xmath610 are the same , implying that there is a one - to - one correspondence between the nonflip period-@xmath12 orbits of @xmath610 and of @xmath300 . by theorem  [ thm : main ] part @xmath297",
    "every nonflip orbit of @xmath300 is in a unique unbounded cascade component of stem period @xmath12 .    to complete the proof of this corollary , it only remains to verify the five estimates listed above .    1 .",
    "this follows from corollary  [ cor:1d - quadratic ] .",
    "there exists a parameter value @xmath36 sufficiently negative that for any values of @xmath640 for @xmath641 , there are no orbits for @xmath642 . thus the system @xmath3 has no orbits .",
    "in particular , each coordinate of each trajectory is strictly monotonically decreasing .",
    "( it is sufficient to establish this for one coordinate . )",
    "if both @xmath64 and @xmath643 are in @xmath127 , and @xmath37 is much larger than @xmath644 , then each @xmath645 is close in size to @xmath646 .",
    "hence @xmath647 is large , arbitrarily large as we increase @xmath37 , while the partial derivatives of @xmath50 are bounded .",
    "hence @xmath635 is diagonally dominant for large @xmath37 .",
    "in addition , since the diagonal entries grow arbitrarily large , @xmath3 is expansive on @xmath20 .",
    "3 .   by the assumptions on @xmath50 and the equivalence of norms in finite dimensions",
    ", there is a @xmath648 such that @xmath649 for every @xmath622 , and @xmath650 for every @xmath622 and @xmath200 . for any point in @xmath519",
    ", there is an @xmath622 such that @xmath651 .",
    "therefore , by corollary  [ cor:1d - quadratic ] , for sufficiently large @xmath37 , if @xmath652 , @xmath653 , implying that the image of @xmath64 is outside of @xmath127 .",
    "if @xmath654 , then for some @xmath622 , @xmath655 . by corollary  [ cor:1d - quadratic ] , for sufficiently large @xmath37 , @xmath656 .",
    "thus @xmath55 is not in @xmath127 .",
    "4 .   let @xmath657 @xmath400 is finite , since each @xmath658 is continuous and limits to @xmath659 as @xmath660 .",

    "( if not , set @xmath662 . )",
    "let @xmath663 , where @xmath648 is defined in the proof of ( c ) .",
    "then for all @xmath622 , @xmath664 . for every @xmath665 , there exists @xmath622 such that @xmath666 .",
    ". therefore the @xmath668 component of the orbit is strictly monotonically decreasing by a positive amount , implying that the trajectory is not bounded .",
    "let @xmath518 be a component of @xmath20 . we first show that if @xmath37 is such that for all @xmath622 , @xmath669 , then there is a point @xmath670 which maps into @xmath127 .",
    "specifically , choose @xmath670 such that for all @xmath622 , @xmath671 .",
    "then for each @xmath622 , @xmath672 .",
    "+ fix @xmath518 .",
    "let @xmath37 be large enough for ( b)-(d ) to hold .",
    "let @xmath673 .",
    "we now show that @xmath674 , and @xmath3 maps @xmath518 diffeomorphically on @xmath127 . in ( c ) and",
    "( d ) , we have shown that the image of the boundary of @xmath518 does not intersect @xmath127 .",
    "since @xmath635 is nonsingular on @xmath518 , @xmath3 is a local diffeomorphism on @xmath518 . therefore the interior of @xmath518 maps to an open set .",
    "the set @xmath113 is compact , so each point of the boundary of @xmath113 is the image of a boundary point of @xmath518 . +",
    "as shown above , there exists a point @xmath675 .",
    "let @xmath65 be any point not in the compact set @xmath113 . on the straight line segment from @xmath65 to @xmath676 ,",
    "let @xmath677 be the point closest to @xmath65 that is in @xmath113 .",
    "then @xmath677 is in the image of the boundary of @xmath518 , so @xmath677 is not in @xmath127 . since @xmath676 is in the convex set @xmath127 but @xmath677 is not , @xmath65 is not in @xmath127 .",
    "hence no point outside of @xmath113 is in @xmath127 .",
    "that is , @xmath127 is a subset of @xmath113 .",
