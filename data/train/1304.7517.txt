    "the classical analysis of the uplinks @xmath0 in a cellular network entails a number of questionable assumptions . among the principal ones are the existence of a lattice or regular grid of base stations and the modeling of intercell interference at a base station as a fixed fraction of the total interference .",
    "although conceptually simple and locally tractable , the grid assumption is a poor model for actual base - station deployments , which can not assume a regular grid structure due to a variety of regulatory and physical constraints .",
    "the intercell - interference assumption is untenable because the fractional proportion of intercell interference varies substantially with the mobile and base - station locations , the shadowing , and the fading .",
    "more recent analyses of cellular networks ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) locate the mobiles and/or base stations according to a two - dimensional poisson point process ( ppp ) over a network that extends infinitely on the euclidian plane , thereby allowing the use of analytical tools from stochastic geometry @xcite , @xcite . although the two principal limitations of the classical approach are eliminated , the ppp approach is still unrealistic because it can not model networks of finite area and does not permit a minimum separation between base stations or between mobiles , although both minimum separations are characteristic of actual macro - cellular deployments .",
    "the analysis in this paper is driven by a new closed - form expression tor2 for the  _ conditional _ outage probability of a communication link , where the conditioning is with respect to an arbitrary realization of the network topology .",
    "the approach involves drawing realizations of the network according to the desired spatial and shadowing models , and then computing the outage probability .",
    "because the outage probability is averaged over the fading , it can be found in closed form with no need to simulate the corresponding channels .",
    "a nakagami - m fading model is assumed , which models a wide class of channels , and the fading parameters do not need to be identical for all communication links .",
    "this flexibility allows the modeling of distance - dependent fading , where mobiles close to the base station have a dominant line - of - sight ( los ) path , while the more distant mobiles are non - los .",
    "the analysis can characterize more than just the average performance of a typical uplink .",
    "the outage probability of each uplink can be constrained , and the statistics of the rate provided to each mobile for its uplink can be determined under various power - control and rate - control policies .    although our analysis is applicable for arbitrary topologies , we focus on a constrained random spatial approach to model the direct - sequence code - division multiple access ( ds - cdma ) uplink .",
    "the spatial model places a fixed number of base stations within a region of finite extent .",
    "the model enforces a minimum separation among the base stations for each _ network realization _ , which comprises a base - station placement , a mobile placement , and a shadowing realization .",
    "the model for both mobile and base - station placement is a binomial point process ( bpp ) with repulsion , which we call a _ uniform clustering _ model @xcite .",
    "a ds - cdma uplink differs from a downlink , which has been presented in a separate paper @xcite , in at least four significant ways .",
    "first , the sources of interference are many mobiles for the uplink whereas the sources are a few base stations for the downlink .",
    "second , sectorization is a critical factor in uplink performance whereas it is of minor importance in downlink performance .",
    "third , the uplink signals arriving at a base station are asynchronous and , hence , non - orthogonal .",
    "fourth , base stations are equipped with better transmit high - power amplifiers and receive low - noise amplifiers than the mobiles .",
    "the net result is that the operational signal - to - noise ratio is typically 5 - 10 db lower for the uplink than for the downlink .",
    "cells may be divided into _ sectors _ by using several directional sector antennas or arrays , each covering disjoint angular sectors , at the base stations .",
    "only mobiles in the directions covered by a sector antenna can cause multiple - access interference on the _ uplink _ from a mobile to its associated sector antenna .",
    "thus , the number of interfering signals on an uplink is reduced approximately by a factor equal to the number of sectors .",
    "practical sector antennas have patterns with sidelobes that extend into adjacent sectors , but the performance degradation due to overlapping sectors is significant only for a small percentage of mobile locations .",
    "three ideal sector antennas and sectors per base station , each covering @xmath1 radians , are assumed in the subsequent analysis .",
    "the mobile antennas are assumed to be omnidirectional .",
    "the network comprises @xmath2 base stations and cells , @xmath3 sectors @xmath4 and @xmath5 mobiles @xmath6 .",
    "the base stations and mobiles are confined to a finite area , which is assumed to be a circle of radius @xmath7 and area @xmath8 .",
    "the sector boundary angles are the same for all base stations .",
    "the variable @xmath9 represents both the @xmath10 sector antenna and its location , and @xmath11 represents the @xmath12 mobile and its location .",
    "an _ exclusion zone _ of radius @xmath13 surrounds each base station , and no other base stations or mobiles are allowed within this zone .",
    "similarly , an exclusion zone of radius @xmath14 surrounds each mobile where no other mobiles are allowed .",
    "example network topologies are shown in fig .",
    "[ figure : network ] . the left subfigure shows the locations of actual base stations in a small city with hilly terrain .",
    "the base - station locations are given by the large filled circles , and the voronoi cells are indicated in the figure .",
    "the minimum base - station separation is observed to be about 0.43 km .",

    "both intracell and intercell interference are received from other mobiles within the covered angle of the sector , but interference from mobiles in extraneous sectors is negligible .",
    "duplexing is assumed to prevent interference from other sector antennas .",
    "the varying propagation delays from the interfering mobiles cause their interference signals to be asynchronous with respect to the desired signal .    in a ds - cdma network of asynchronous quadriphase direct - sequence systems ,",
