    "the first observed outburst @xcite of the globular cluster terzan 5 source igr j174802446 in oct / nov , 2010 revealed that it is a neutron star low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) and an 11 hz pulsar @xcite .",
    "an x - ray burst was observed from this source with _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) on oct 13 , 2010 @xcite . while this is not surprising",
    "even for a pulsar , what made this source very interesting is the recurrent bursts observed for next few days @xcite .",
    "as the source intensity increased , the bursts became more frequent , and eventually disappeared , and millihertz ( mhz ) quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) appeared @xcite .",
    "finally , the bursts reappeared , and as the source intensity decreased , they became less frequent @xcite .",
    "the burst recurrence frequencies observed between october 13 and 16 converge asymptotically towards the mhz qpo frequency , which suggests that these qpo is related to bursts @xcite .",
    "if these bursts are type - i or thermonuclear @xcite , then such a relation is expected from a widely accepted mhz qpo model , which interprets this timing feature as a signature of marginally stable nuclear burning @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite reported that , except the oct 13 burst , no other burst up to oct 26 showed a clear cooling trend during burst decay .",
    "this motivated them to suggest that , except the first burst , others are type - ii bursts .",
    "the type - ii bursts are believed to be caused by the accretion instability , and hence powered by the gravitational potential energy .",
    "this would mean that the mhz qpos are related to the accretion dynamics , rather than nuclear burning , and hence plausibly could not be used as a tool to measure the neutron star parameters @xcite .",
    "type - ii bursts have so far been observed from two sources : rapid burster and gro j174428 @xcite .",
    "@xcite have also indicated that igr j174802446 might be a gro j174428 analogue ( since both have relatively wide orbit and slow pulsations ) , further strengthening the gravitational origin argument for the igr j174802446 bursts .",
    "it is therefore extremely important to investigate whether the x - ray bursts from igr j174802446 are powered by the nuclear energy or by the gravitational energy ( 1 ) in order to understand the nature of the unique source igr j174802446 , and its unique bursts , and ( 2 ) to find out the origin of mhz qpos and their usefulness in understanding thermonuclear bursts and in measuring neutron star parameters .",
    "we have performed spectral and timing analysis of the entire rxte proportional counter array ( pca ) data from igr j174802446 , the details of which will be reported elsewhere . in this letter",
    ", we report and discuss the results required to address the single very important question mentioned above .",
    "the neutron star lmxb igr j174802446 was observed almost everyday with _ rxte _ between oct 13 , 2010 and nov 19 , 2010 , i.e. , during its outburst .",
    "the total observation time was @xmath2 ks ( proposal no .",
    "95437 ; 46 obsids : 95437 - 01 - 01 - 00 to 95437 - 01 - 14 - 00 )",
    ". we have found @xmath3 bursts ( including the very weak ones ) in the _ rxte _ data of this source , and analyzed the entire pca data with the aim of understanding the nature of these unique bursts . in order to examine the lightcurves , and to measure the source properties such as burst duration , burst interval ( time gap between two successive bursts ) and spectral evolution during a burst",
    ", we have used the event - mode / good - xenon files .",
    "this is because , this mode has sufficiently good time resolution and spectral resolution . in order to perform the time - resolved spectroscopy of the bursts , which could be comfortably distinguished from the non - burst emissions",
    ", we have divided each burst into segments with sufficient statistics . for each segment , we have created a total energy spectrum with deadtime correction @xcite , and a background spectrum from the pre - burst emission @xcite .",
    "usually a blackbody model is used to describe a burst spectrum , and hence we have fitted each spectrum in @xmath4 kev with an absorbed blackbody ( phabs*bbodyrad in xspec ) for a fixed neutral hydrogen column density @xmath5 @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the blackbody provides acceptable fits ( for the degrees of freedom @xmath7 ) with @xmath8 for @xmath9% segments and @xmath10 for @xmath11% segments , excluding a few segments with @xmath12 .",
    "we have used these fits to infer the total energy ( time - integrated flux or fluence ) , as well as the evolution of temperature , emitting area and flux of each burst .",
    "we have also fitted the deadtime corrected non - burst spectra in @xmath4 kev , using backgrounds created from the _ rxte _ data analysis tool pcabackest .",
    "these spectra were made from standard-2 mode files .",
    "first we have tried the conventionally used thermal models absorbed blackbody ( phabs*bbodyrad in xspec ) and absorbed disk - blackbody ( phabs*diskbb in xspec ) , as well as the non - thermal model absorbed powerlaw ( phabs*powerlaw in xspec ) , in order to fit the non - burst spectra .",
    "similar to the burst spectral fitting , we have fixed @xmath13 at @xmath14 @xmath6 . each of these single component models gave extremely bad fit .",
    "next we have tried three two - component models combining two of bbodyrad , diskbb and powerlaw in rotation .",
    "the phabs*(bbodyrad+powerlaw ) model gave much better fit than phabs*(bbodyrad+diskbb ) , and somewhat better fit than phabs*(diskbb+powerlaw ) .",
    "furthermore , the addition of a gaussian component describing an iron k@xmath15 emission line between @xmath16 kev improves the fit significantly ( e.g. , significance @xmath17 for the oct 26 , 2010 data ) , and gives acceptable fits ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we have fitted each non - burst spectrum with the phabs*(bbodyrad+powerlaw+gaussian ) model in order to infer the flux , fluence and other spectral parameters . we have tried to estimate the contributions of the field sources to this non - burst flux .",
    "the total 26 kev _ chandra _ count rate of all the sources ( except cx25 , which is igr j174802446 ; @xcite ) given in tables 1 and 2 of @xcite is @xmath18 cps , which is about 0.1% of the 26 kev _ chandra _ count rate equivalent to the lowest ( of oct 13 , 2010 ) observed _ rxte _ pca flux .",
    "this shows that the non - burst flux has been overestimated by @xmath19 .",
    "in this letter , we report the evolution of various burst and non - burst properties of igr j174802446 throughout the source outburst . examples of a few days given in table  [ properties ] and fig .  [ lc ] show that the burst properties are well correlated with the non - burst intensity . the oct 13 burst detected with _",
    "rxte _ was likely to be powered by nuclear energy because of the following reasons .",
    "( a ) the burst light curve rises rapidly and decays slowly like a typical thermonuclear burst ( fig .  [ lc ] ) .",
    "( b ) the blackbody temperature decreases during burst decay @xcite .",
    "( c ) intensity variation of this burst at the pulsar frequency was detected @xcite , and this feature is broader in power spectrum during the burst than in the non - burst portions . here we discuss the properties of the bursts following the oct 13 burst , in order to find out whether these bursts are powered by nuclear energy or gravitational energy .",
    "\\(1 ) burst spectrum vs. non - burst spectrum : the burst spectrum of igr j174802446 is typically well described with a blackbody (   [ observationanddataanalysis ] ) , and the addition of a powerlaw does not improve the fit ( note that , for fainter bursts , this might be due to insufficient statistical quality ) .",
    "the non - burst spectrum of igr j174802446 can not be fitted with a blackbody , and a blackbody plus powerlaw model is required ( see   [ observationanddataanalysis ] ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "so these two spectra are plausibly sufficiently different , indicating different origins . however , these two spectra are similar to each other for gro j174428 @xcite .",
    "\\(2 ) temperature evolution during burst decay : most of the bursts from igr j174802446 do not exhibit a clear cooling trend during the burst decay . however , this can not rule out the nuclear origin of the bursts for the following reasons . ( a )",
    "the nov 18 burst shows a cooling trend with a significance of @xmath20 , while the similar bursts of nov 19 do not show such a trend .",
    "( b ) several likely thermonuclear bursts ( e.g. , 18th burst of exo 0748676 in @xcite ) did not show a cooling trend .",
    "( c ) if the color factor @xmath21 increases with the decrease of the effective temperature @xmath22 ( may be possible for high metalicity of burning matter , see table 2 of @xcite ) , the cooling trend may not be visible , as the color temperature @xmath23 .",
    "\\(3 ) ratio of non - burst fluence to burst fluence : for a thermonuclear burst , the ratio of the nuclear energy generated to the gravitational energy released is expected to be @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the ratio of non - burst fluence to burst fluence gives an upper limit of this energy ratio , as stable nuclear burning can happen during the non - burst time .",
    "the ratio of the fluences ( @xmath0 ) inferred for igr j174802446 bursts throughout the outburst is very consistent with the plausible thermonuclear origin of these bursts ( see table  [ properties ] ) .",
    "however , this ratio is significantly smaller than 40 for rapid burster ( @xmath24 ; @xcite ) and gro j174428 ( @xmath1 ; @xcite ) , indicating that the type - ii bursts from these sources are not of thermonuclear origin .",
    "note that , although we have estimated the ratio of the fluences for igr j174802446 in the @xmath4 kev range , the bolometric ratio would also be consistent with the expected value @xmath9 because of the following reasons . ( a )",
    "since the non - burst spectrum has two continuum components ( a blackbody similar to the burst spectrum , plus a powerlaw ) , a larger portion of the non - burst energy is likely to be outside the @xmath4 kev range compared to the burst energy .",
    "( b ) even if the entire non - burst energy is in the @xmath4 kev range ( which is the conservative scenario ) , our estimated ratio will be less by a small factor of @xmath25 for a typical burst blackbody temperature of 2 kev .",
    "\\(4 ) burst shape and duration : the bursts neither show  ringing \" nor  flat top \" like the type - ii bursts of the rapid burster @xcite .",
    "their duration gradually changes ( table  [ properties ] ) unlike the gro j174428 bursts @xcite .",
    "[ shape ] clearly shows that the shapes of the bursts are similar to the that of the oct 13 burst , and any change is gradual throughout the outburst .",
    "this would not happen if the oct 13 burst and the other bursts originated from two independent physical mechanisms .",
    "these points support the nuclear origin of the igr j174802446 bursts .",
    "\\(5 ) intensity dips after bursts : while type - ii bursts from the rapid burster and gro j174428 are followed by intensity dips @xcite , no clear evidence of such dips has been found for igr j174802446 bursts .",
    "only 10% bursts are followed by weak dips , which are plausibly of the non - burst origin .",
    "\\(6 ) burst fluence versus burst interval : burst fluence is positively correlated with burst interval for igr j174802446 ( table  [ properties ] ) , while the fluence of gro j174428 type - ii bursts remained approximately constant when the burst interval changed by factors of @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "\\(7 ) burst peak flux and burst fluence versus non - burst flux : while with the increase of non - burst flux , both burst peak flux and burst fluence of gro j174428 increase @xcite , these parameter values of igr j174802446 decrease ( table  [ properties ] ) .",
    "the gradual ( as opposed to abrupt ) change of all the burst properties throughout the outburst ( table  [ properties ] and fig .",
    "[ lc ] ) strongly indicate that all the bursts from igr j174802446 , including the oct 13 burst , originate from the same physical mechanism .",
    "the points 3 , 4 and 5 of   [ resultsanddiscussion ] suggest that these bursts are of thermonuclear origin , and mhz qpos , plausibly caused by the quasi - stable nuclear burning , can be used as a tool to measure the neutron star parameters .",
    "the point 2 of ",
    "[ resultsanddiscussion ] indicates that a clear cooling may not always be present during a thermonuclear burst decay .",
    "the points 1 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 and 7 of   [ resultsanddiscussion ] show that igr j174802446 is not a gro j174428 analogue (   [ introduction ] ) .",
    "finally , we note that the igr j174802446 bursts are similar to the gs 1826 - 238 bursts in their clock - like recurrence times and in the shortening of the recurrence time with the non - burst flux increase @xcite .",
