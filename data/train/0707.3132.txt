    "since the launch of the _ swift _ satellite @xcite , early long - wavelength observations of @xmath0-ray bursts ( grbs ) have become routine . _ swift _ has provided prompt triggers to events since early 2005 , for which `` prompt '' signifies `` during @xmath0-ray emission '' .",
    "there is a growing number of optical lightcurves that begin during , or within seconds after , the @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "there are also several cases with prompt optical non - detections which constrain the optical brightness during the grb .",
    "prompt and very early broadband emission has been the major advance in _",
    "swift_-era grb studies , opening serious investigations of important physical questions .",
    "one example is the nature of the relativistic outflow , generally thought of as baryonic with energy released by internal shocks .",
    "the proposed alternatives include magnetized flows which release energy via magnetic reconnection @xcite .",
    "the early broadband detections at x - ray and optical wavelengths are now being used to test these models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    from the beginning of the afterglow discovery era",
    ", optical counterparts have been found to have a large range in brightness . despite good observations , a significant fraction ( @xmath150% ) of events",
    "do not have detected optical afterglows .",
    "these `` optically dark '' grbs have produced questions regarding grb physics and environment ( see pre- and post-_swift _ reviews , such as * ? ? ?",
    "* respectively ) .",
    "nondetections during prompt optical observations are not precisely the same as these optically dark grbs . in a few events",
    "deeper post - grb observations detect the optical transient .",
    "this raises the question as to whether prompt limits are `` promptly dark '' ; are the limiting fluxes consistent with the brightness range observed in prompt optical detections , or do prompt nondetections require a separate population of optical properties",
    "? such properties could be due to either intrinsic ( faint events , or faint optical  to@xmath0-ray flux ratios ) or extrinsic ( local dust absorption , or the lyman-@xmath2 forest absorption from high @xmath3 ) causes .",
    "`` excessively '' faint prompt optical emission would therefore have interesting implications for the grb spectral shape or environment . while the peak frequency of the grb has often been constrained ( @xmath4@xmath5 peaking near a few 100 kev , see the review by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the shape of the prompt emission s low - energy tail is not well known , with self - absorption frequency estimates from the optical to x - ray ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as well , indications of high redshift would be important .",
    "while there are suggested redshift indicators from grb @xmath0-ray properties alone , these are not proven , as discussed critically by @xcite .",
    "the rotse - iii project has provided some of the earliest optical observations of grb triggers , with a number of detections . to date , there has been no consistent correlation between prompt optical fluxes and the contemporaneous @xmath0-rays ( e.g. , see the discussions in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . this paper discusses prompt rotse - iii observations under good sky conditions which did not yield detections .",
    "the limits placed upon the ratio of optical emission to the higher energy emission are discussed in comparison with the behavior associated with prompt detections .    in the following discussion ,",
    "the spectral flux density is characterized by the spectral index @xmath6 , with @xmath7 .",
    "this convention relates @xmath6 to the @xmath0-ray photon index @xmath8 by @xmath9 . to designate a spectral region ,",
    "subscripts `` opt '' , `` x '' , and `` @xmath0 '' for @xmath6 indicate an index for the optical , x - ray , and @xmath0-ray bands respectively .",
    "a spectral index spanning two regions is designated with both , e.g. , @xmath10 for the spectral index interpolating between the optical and @xmath0-ray frequencies .",
    "we note briefly that the overall spectral and temporal shape of afterglows typically suggests synchrotron emission from a fireball whose accelerated electrons have a lorentz factor distribution @xmath11 ( this is reviewed , e.g. , by * ? ? ?",
    "the afterglow spectrum has spectral breaks : principally @xmath12 , due to the minimum lorentz factor @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , the cooling frequency .",
    "these provide predictions for the spectral shape of a single synchrotron component .",
    "the index @xmath15 at frequencies below the peak in @xmath5 ( @xmath16 ) , @xmath17 for @xmath18 , and @xmath19 for the case when @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "( when @xmath22 , the spectral shape is @xmath23 for frequencies between them . )",
    "these predictions , with @xmath6 from @xmath24 to @xmath25 for @xmath26  @xmath27 , can be compared to the constraints upon @xmath10 .",
    "figure [ fig : schema ] shows some possible combinations of @xmath10 and @xmath28 .",
    "the @xmath0-ray spectrum may predict the optical flux ( @xmath29 ) , indicating that a single power - law ( synchrotron - like ) component could account for the broadband spectrum .",
    "when @xmath30 , the @xmath0-ray spectrum underpredicts the optical flux , implying a separate low - energy emission component .",
    "when @xmath31 , the @xmath0-ray spectrum overpredicts the optical flux , indicating a spectral rollover between the optical and high frequencies .",
    "when there are only prompt optical upper limits in flux density , one can nevertheless discriminate between cases where @xmath28 either predicts or overpredicts the optical flux limit from those where @xmath28 could underpredict the optical flux .",
    "the rotse - iii array is a worldwide network of 0.45  m robotic , automated telescopes , built for fast ( @xmath32 s ) responses to grb triggers from satellites such as _ swift_. they have a wide ( @xmath33 ) field of view imaged onto a marconi @xmath34 back - illuminated thinned ccd , and operate without filters .",
    "the rotse - iii systems are described in detail in @xcite .",
    "rotse - iii images were reduced and processed using the rphot pipeline , with routines based upon daophot @xcite .",
    "objects were identified via sextractor @xcite and calibrated astrometrically and photometrically with the usnob1.0 catalog .",
    "they are tied to the @xmath35 band , and these unfiltered `` @xmath35-equivalent '' magnitudes are designated as `` @xmath36 '' .",

    "the table is similar to table 5 of @xcite , which is also used for comparison .",
    "most of the prompt optical detections used for this table are from rotse - iii observations .",
    "these include grb060111b @xcite , grb060729 @xcite , grb060904b @xcite and grb061007 @xcite which are discussed in a comprehensive analysis paper ( rykoff _ et al . _ , in prep . ) .",
    "grb061121 was promptly detected by rotse ; these data are presented in @xcite .",
    "grb060927 was a high - redshift event @xcite .",

    "one case of a prompt limit with a later detection is the first rotse observation of grb060729 .",
    "the ot flux was rising , and the second 5-second image was the first to yield a detection ( tables [ tab : optgam1 ] and [ tab : optgam2 ] show that the flux rises from @xmath1 1/2 to 2 mjy over the first few images ) .    in grb060614 ,",
    "the rotse limits at 29 seconds post - trigger were obtained before the subsequent uvot afterglow detection at 100 seconds post - trigger .",
    "this initial uvot v - band detection @xcite had notable flux uncertainty ( 18.4@xmath390.5 mag ) but is significantly ( nearly 3 mag ) fainter than the rotse limits .",
    "the rotse limit values are fully consistent with the later detection , and constrain the flux decay to have been no more rapid than @xmath40 from a half minute to two minutes post - trigger .",
    "optical detections indicate that the grb can not be at high @xmath3 , as the lyman-@xmath2 forest would absorb the optical flux . indeed , grb060729 has @xmath41 @xcite , and the host of grb060614 is at @xmath42 @xcite , ( although there is some controversy , with an estimate of @xmath43 , * ? ? ?",
    "there are further grbs with prompt limits followed by optical detections at @xmath441hr : grb050306 @xcite , grb050713a @xcite , and grb061110 @xcite .",
    "the prompt nondetections of these three events can not be attributed to high @xmath3 .",
    "bat data were used for @xmath0-ray comparisons in these _ swift _ bursts . for the @xmath0-ray data ,",
    "the event files from the public archives were analyzed with the battools and xspec11 software packages .",

    ", these are determined directly along with @xmath28 during the precise time interval of each optical observation . for the remainder of the data where the signal is insufficient , the count rate during the interval is converted to fluxes using the bat spectrum during a longer , overlapping interval .",
    "the analyses are the same as described for the grb051109a and grb051111 events , in @xcite .",
    "in addition , a few events have prompt x - ray data ( in the @xmath46 kev band , with an effective frequency @xmath47hz ) as well .",

    ", the xrtpipeline tool calibrates and performs standard filtering and screening .",
    "this is followed by count extractions from appropriate regions for the source and background , the generation of response files with the ftools task xrtmkarf , and spectral fits to yield fluxes . for grb061121",
    ", the xrt data is taken directly from the flux densities in @xcite ; the reductions were similar and compensate for the significant pileup effects , as discussed there in detail .",
    "there are two cases with optical nondetections and x - ray prompt detections within the sample presented , grb050713a and grb060614 .",
    "a limit upon @xmath48 adds little to the information from the @xmath10 limit ; the events are compatible with an interpretation of the prompt @xmath49  sec x - ray flux as an extension of the contemporaneous @xmath0-rays .",
    "this was seen in a quick analysis of the grb060614 archive data ( as well as the spectral information given in * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , and by the @xcite analysis of grb050713a xrt and bat data .",
    "further detailed comparisons are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the spectral index ( or its limit ) was determined between the optical and higher - energy bands in the same manner as those presented in @xcite . in brief , the optical data was corrected for galactic extinction and converted to flux densities as if the @xmath36 magnitudes were @xmath35 , using the zeropoints of @xcite .",
    "these data are in tables [ tab : optgam1 ] , [ tab : optgam2 ] , along with the flux densities of the @xmath0-ray detections ( and x - ray , where applicable ) . the flux densities and effective frequencies of the bands",

    "11 of these grbs only had prompt optical limits , while 14 were consistently promptly detected in the optical , and a further 2 events had both prompt limits and detections .",
    "the data includes a total of 43 distinct prompt optical detections , and 55 prompt optical limits .",
    "grbs show diversity in their prompt optical and @xmath0-ray brightnesses .",
    "optical flux densities span 100 @xmath51jy to 3 jy while contemporaneous @xmath0-ray flux densities take values from 6 @xmath51jy to 4 mjy .",

    "in addition , observations of some events show both @xmath10 and @xmath28 changing significantly during a burst .",
    "@xmath28 generally evolves from hard to soft .",
    "this is a previously known characteristic of many grbs ( e.g. , as reviewed by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , now considered in models of prompt emission ( such as  jitter  radiation ; * ? ? ?",
    "the changes in @xmath10 indicate that optical prompt fluxes are generally not correlated with the @xmath0-ray emission .    there has been discussion in the literature concerning whether prompt optical emission is an extension of the @xmath0-rays , or is a separate component .",
    "@xcite indicates an optical component correlated to the grb in grb041219a , while @xcite and @xcite discuss the apparent blend of @xmath0-ray  correlated and uncorrelated components in the prompt optical lightcurves of grbs 050820a and 051111 respectively .",

    "for these , @xmath28 overpredicts the optical , requiring a rollover in the spectrum between the @xmath0-ray and optical frequencies , whether or not there are separate emission components at optical and @xmath0-ray energies .",
    "nearly all the limits give @xmath10 versus @xmath28 falling into this category .",

    "its constraints are insufficient and allow either @xmath30 or @xmath31",
    ".      the optical limits are not demonstrably the result of abnormally faint prompt optical flux .",
    "the prompt flux limits are typically 16th or 17th magnitude ( @xmath58  mjy ) .",
    "prompt detections have been recorded from small fractions of a mjy to a few jy .",
    "as well , the @xmath0-ray flux densities of grbs with prompt optical limits are similar to the lower values of @xmath5(@xmath0 ) from grbs with optical detections ; both sets of events have @xmath5(@xmath0 ) ranging from several @xmath51jy to over a mjy .",
    "the prompt limits require neither intrinsically fainter emission nor excess absorption from dust or ( high-@xmath3 ) lyman-@xmath2 .",
    "high redshifts are not a general solution for the prompt optical limits , as some events are detected later (  [ latedet ] ) .    the values of grb @xmath28 contemporaneous with prompt optical limits are similar to the @xmath28 when prompt observations gave optical detections .",
    "the @xmath28 of optical nondetections are on average softer than the @xmath28 of detections , ranging from @xmath59 to 0 , as compared to @xmath56 to @xmath60 .",
    "however , the data are not consistently sampled , leading to no strong conclusions other than that prompt observations of the few grbs with the hardest @xmath28 have yielded detections rather than limits .",
    "similarly , the limits on @xmath10 for nondetections ( @xmath61 ) are in the range of most of the @xmath10 from the prompt detections ( from @xmath54 to @xmath55 ) .",
    "the prompt nondetections are consistent with coming from the harder end of the @xmath10 distribution , as all of the @xmath10 limits are harder than the softest @xmath10 value calculated from prompt detections . however , there is no evidence of bimodality of @xmath10 .",
    "it is only in one event ( grb061007 ) that the @xmath10 of optical detections is softer than the softest allowed @xmath10 from a prompt limit .",
    "this was for epochs at the end of the event , which may be the beginning of the afterglow , as @xmath0-ray , x - ray and optical frequencies lie on a single spectral powerlaw .",
    "there is not one set of @xmath10 for the optically detected and another for the nondetected cases .",
    "these overlaps in @xmath10 and @xmath28 are readily seen in figure [ fig : betas ] .",
    "for grb061121 , the comparisons of @xmath10 and @xmath62 require a peak in the broadband @xmath5 spectrum .",
    "this is discussed in detail by @xcite , where it can be inferred to be near 1 kev initially and to subsequently drop in frequency .",
    "grb060729 also implies a peak between the optical and x - ray during the epoch with optical , x - ray and @xmath0-ray data . in that case",
    ", @xmath28 appears to be harder than @xmath63 , but this may be due to the general softening trend of @xmath28 and the measurement of @xmath28 over the x - ray epoch using data beginning well before the x - ray observations .",
    "a `` convex '' overall x - ray@xmath0-ray spectral shape can not be inferred from the weak @xmath0-ray detection .",
    "in contrast , the grb061007 prompt x - ray epochs do not demonstrate such a peak . from the first grb061007 epoch with x - ray data ,",
    "the spectral indices show that the @xmath0-ray and x - ray bands are in a single spectral segment .",
    "this is not unusual ;  [ sec : hidata ] indicates that in the two prompt optical limit cases , the x - ray and @xmath0-ray data could be from the same spectral segment . in grb061007 , allowing for local extinction corrections , the entire broadband spectrum ( optical , x - ray , @xmath0-ray ) forms a single spectral segment ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 2 , which fits an absorbed @xmath64 spectrum ) .",
    "this would be expected for an early afterglow where the high - energy emission from the forward shock extends above the x - rays .",
    "prompt optical limits fall within the range of optical fluxes and optical  to@xmath0-ray flux ratios observed from prompt optical detections .",
    "the prompt limits yield constraints upon optical ",
    "to@xmath0-ray flux ratios at the faint end of the ratios measured from prompt detections . this does not imply a different set of intrinsic or environmental properties for events with detections and nondetections ; there is wide overlap in fluxes and flux ratios between the limits and detections .",
    "moreover , prompt detections show great variety , and demonstrate diverse connections ( or lack thereof ) with the contemporaneous @xmath0-rays .",
    "the most economical explanation for prompt optical nondetections is that they are events drawn from the faint end of the range of prompt optical emission .",
