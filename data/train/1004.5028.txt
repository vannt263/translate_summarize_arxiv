    "percolation represents a paradigmatic model of a geometric phase transition @xcite .",
    "it has been widely studied and has numerous applications in many areas of physics @xcite .",
    "its importance and practical applications are described in detail elsewhere , see for example @xcite . here",
    ", we will present for the sake of clarity and completeness , some necessary definitions of important quantities that commonly appear in the literature . in the classical site percolation model , the sites of a square lattice",
    "are randomly occupied with particles with probability @xmath0 , or remain empty with probability @xmath1 .",
    "neighboring occupied sites are considered to belong to the same cluster and percolation theory simply deals with the number and properties of these clusters .",
    "when the occupation probability @xmath0 is small , the occupied sites are either isolated or form very small clusters .",
    "on the other hand , for large @xmath0 there are a lot of occupied sites that have formed one large cluster and it is possible to find several paths of occupied sites which a walker can use to move from one side of the lattice to the other . in this latter case , it is said that a giant component of connected sites exists in the lattice .",
    "this component does not appear in a gradual `` linear '' way with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "it appears suddenly at a critical occupation probability @xmath2 .",
    "below @xmath3 there are only small clusters and even if we increase the lattice size considerably , these clusters remain small , i.e. the largest cluster does not depend on the system size . above @xmath3 ,",
    "suddenly , small clusters join together to form a large cluster whose size scales with system size .",
    "hence , the term giant component or infinite cluster which is very common in the literature @xcite .    in percolation",
    ", @xmath0 plays the same role as the temperature in thermal phase transitions , i.e. that of the control parameter , while the order parameter is the probability @xmath4 that a site belongs to the infinite cluster . for @xmath5 ,",
    "@xmath4 increases with @xmath0 by a power law @xmath6 other important quantities are the correlation length @xmath7 which is defined as the mean distance between two sites on the same finite cluster and the mean number of sites @xmath8 of a finite cluster .",
    "when @xmath0 approaches @xmath3 , @xmath7 increases as @xmath9 the mean number of sites @xmath8 of a finite cluster also diverges at @xmath3 @xmath10 the critical exponents @xmath11 and @xmath12 describe the critical behavior associated with the percolation transition and are universal .",
    "they do not depend on the structure of the lattice ( e.g. , square or triangular ) or on the type of percolation ( site , bond or even continuum ) @xcite .",
    "in this paper we study numerically the percolation properties of the growing clusters model @xcite which we describe in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] .",
    "we focus on the intermediate concentration regime and find that the model exhibits a non - trivial percolation transition which belongs in a different universality class from standard percolation .",
    "we determine quite accurately the position of @xmath3 , and the values of the critical exponents associated with this transition .",
    "the growing clusters model is presented in detail in @xcite . here",
    ", we provide a brief description of it . a square lattice of size @xmath13",
    "is randomly populated with `` seeds '' with probability @xmath0 .",
    "these seeds are allowed to grow to clusters isotropically and stop when they touch another growing aggregate , see fig .",
    "[ graph1 ] for a schematic of the system evolution . at every time step ,",
    "i.e. one monte carlo step ( mcs ) all seeds are investigated once for the possibility to grow in size instantaneously in all neighboring sites .",
    "investigation sequence is random in order .",
    "each seed is allowed to grow its periphery by one layer ( increase the radius by one ) provided that there is no overlapping with other growing seeds .",
    "thus , each seed becomes an evolving cluster .",
    "as soon as two , or more , clusters touch each other , the growth of all of the adjoined clusters stop .",
    "neighboring sites are considered to belong in the same stable cluster . to study the model",
    "we perform large scale monte carlo simulations as described in @xcite and we monitor the properties of the clusters that are formed .",
    "monte carlo steps ( mcs ) 6 seeds are randomly placed on a @xmath14 lattice .",
    "top right : after @xmath15 mcs there are 6 evolving clusters .",
    "bottom left : after @xmath16 mcs there are 4 evolving clusters , as 2 clusters have touched each other and stopped growing .",
    "bottom right : final state of the system .",
    "there are no evolving clusters and 3 stable clusters have been formed.,width=321,height=321 ]",
    "equations [ eq1]-[eq3 ] are valid for infinite systems close to the critical threshold . in practice , however , it is not possible to use them to calculate the critical exponents with considerable accuracy due to finite size effects .",
    "thus , one has to resort to finite size scaling @xcite techniques . due to the finite size of the lattices that can be simulated the order parameter",
    "is expected to depend on the system size . assuming that we are close to the critical threshold so that the correlation length @xmath7 is comparable to the system size @xmath13 it can be shown that the probability @xmath17 that a site belongs to the largest cluster follows the scaling relation : @xmath18 \\label{eq4}\\ ] ] where we have deliberately used the notation @xmath17 instead of @xmath4 in order to emphasize the finiteness of the systems . here @xmath19 is a suitable scaling function .",
    "similarly , any other quantity varying as @xmath20 is expected to scale similar to eq . [ eq4 ] with @xmath21 replaced by the appropriate exponent @xmath22 and with a different scaling function @xmath19 . at @xmath23 , these quantities are expected to scale as power law since the scaling function reduces to a simple proportionality constant .",
    "this result gives a way to determine the critical exponents .",
    "one important characteristic of the standard percolation transition is that exactly at the critical point , the largest cluster has a fractal geometry meaning that the mass of the largest cluster @xmath24 scales with the system size as @xmath25 , where the fractal dimension @xmath26 is known to be equal to 91/48 . since @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the dimensionality of the space(@xmath29 in the lattice case ) one",
    "can easily derive a scaling law relating @xmath30 and @xmath31 , namely @xmath32 .",
    "to obtain an indication of the system critical behavior , we start by monitoring the size of the largest cluster @xmath33 as a function of the initial `` seed '' probability @xmath0 , see @xcite and fig . 2 therein .",
    "there , it is evident that the system exhibits two phase transitions : one very sharp transition at @xmath34 and a second , smoother , transition around @xmath35 .",
    "the first transition is discussed in detail at @xcite and characterized by the fact that the size of the largest cluster @xmath24 , which is the order parameter of the system , has a discontinuity for @xmath34 and , thus , the system exhibits a sharp , albeit artificial , first order phase transition .",
    "the second phase transition turns out to be rather interesting .",
    "it is reminiscent of the classical percolation transition and it is important to clarify the extent of this similarity .",
    "thus , we simulate systems of several different sizes and for several different initial seed concentrations . after allowing the growth process to complete and the systems to reach their final states , we study the probability @xmath17 that a randomly chosen site belongs to the largest cluster .",
    "when there are only few initial seeds , after the evolution of the system is completed , the clusters formed are small and isolated .",
    "however , we expect that with increasing @xmath0 when a large number of seeds is introduced , the growth process will lead to the formation of a large spanning cluster .",
    "this is the classic behavior seen in a system which undergoes a continuous phase transition . in such cases",
    ", we can use finite size scaling to determine the position of the critical concentration , @xmath3 , and the critical exponents .",
    ", as a function of the lattice size @xmath13 for three different initial concentrations , @xmath36 and @xmath37(black squares , red dots and green triangles respectively ) .",

    "[ fig1 ] we plot the size of the largest cluster @xmath38 as a function of the lattice size @xmath13 for three different initial concentrations , namely @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( black squares , red dots and green triangles respectively ) . for @xmath39 ( squares )",
    "we observe a downward bending curve which clearly indicates that @xmath39 is below @xmath3 as @xmath24 does not scale with the system size for large @xmath13 . for @xmath40 ( circles )",
    "we observe a straight line implying a power law scaling as expected for @xmath23 .",
    "this value for the critical point agrees reasonably well with our preliminary estimation for the critical point from the position of the maximum of the second largest cluster @xcite . for @xmath41 ( triangles )",
    "we observe a curve which is bending slightly upwards for large @xmath13 , indicating that we are above @xmath3 , although admittedly for the sizes of lattices simulated here is quite difficult to observe the bending for @xmath41 .",
    "we will , however , use another method below to confirm that @xmath42 for the growing clusters model .",
