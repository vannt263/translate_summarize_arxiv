    "many economic time series are non - stationary , and analysts have to take account of that fact .",
    "a time series can be trend - stationary or have a random walk component ( difference - stationarity ) . in the first case shocks are temporary , whereas shocks to a random walk are permanent . for unit root tests we refer to dickey and fuller ( 1979 ) , phillip ( 1979 ) , phillips and perron ( 1988 ) , bierens ( 1997 ) , and breitung ( 2002 ) . often ,",
    "in particular for financial data , the unit root hypothesis can not be rejected , and then we are interested to detect as soon as possible a change - point where the time series is affected by an additional deterministic drift term .",
    "the problem discussed in this article should not be mixed up with the so - called random walk hypothesis which addresses a different issue , namely whether future values are predictable using past values . for that problem",
    "we refer to french and roll ( 1986 ) , fama and french ( 1988 ) , lo and mackinlay ( 1988 ) , poterba and summers ( 1988 ) , and jegadeesh ( 1991 ) .",
    "an important property of a random walk is that there are stochastic trends which can be mixed up with deterministic trends . nevertheless , a random walk , i.e. , a stochastic trend can be overlayed by a deterministic trend component .",
    "hence we study the problem to detect a nonparametric drift component in a random walk .",
    "we assume that the observations @xmath0 arrive sequentially and @xmath1 where @xmath2 are i.i.d .",
    "innovations with @xmath3 and @xmath4 . for the weak distributional limits presented in this paper the i.i.d .",
    "assumption can be relaxed by a weak condition discussed in detail in section  1 , which allows , e.g. , for correlated time series with garch effects . to study asymptotic properties analytically , we will model the deterministic drift @xmath5 more explicitly .",
    "however , the detection procedure will not depend on a specification of the alternative , but decides after each new observation whether to continue with observations or whether to stop and reject the null hypothesis of no drift . in any case",
    "we stop no later than after the @xmath6th observation , where @xmath6 is done in advance .    whereas a posteriori methods aim at estimating consistently the time point where the mean changes and therefore employ data before and after the change point , sequential monitoring methods use only past and current data , aiming at the detection of a change as soon as possible .",
    "the a posteriori approach is well studied .",
    "for example , kim and hart ( 1998 ) propose a nonparametric approach to test for a change in a mean function when the data are dependent .",
    "predictive tests for structural change with unknown changepoint have been studied in ghysels , guay and hall ( 1997 ) .",
    "the analysis of multiple structural changes in linear models has been discussed , e.g. , in bai and perron ( 1998 ) .",
    "yakir , krieger and pollak ( 1990 ) use the data after the change for optimization .",
    "hukov and slab ( 2001 ) studied nonparametric multiple change point detection based on kernel - weighted means similar as studied in this article .",
    "kernel - weighted averages have also been discussed by ferger ( 1994b , 1994c , 1995 , 1996 ) and brodsky and darkhovsky ( 1993 , 2002 ) , where the latter examines a posteori and monitoring procedures .",
    "sequential monitoring procedures to control for the derivative of a process mean have been studied in schmid and steland ( 2000 ) .",
    "results for jump - preserving smoothers can be found in chiu _",

    "we refer to ferger ( 1994a , 1997 ) , gombay and horvth ( 1995 ) , and horvth and hukov ( 2003 ) .",
    "the contribution of the present paper is to study sequential smoothers to monitor random walks to detect deterministic drifts , and to contrast the results to former work about stationary processes ( steland 2004b , 2005b ) . whereas in the stationary case the normed delay of the procedure converges to a deterministic constant , for a random walk the relevant ( kernel - weighted ) partial sums have a different convergence rate .",
    "hence , the statistics have to be scaled appropriately to obtain well - defined limit distributions .",
    "further , depending on the rate of convergence of the local alternative , we obtain a deterministic or stochastic limit under the alternative . as a by - product",
    ", we provide the asymptotic law of the nadaraya - watson estimator .",
    "our approach via kernel - weighted sequential partial sum processes yields asymptotic results for both the _ classic fixed sample design _ and the _ sequential sampling design_. compared to classic nonparametric regression , the monitoring framework as suggested by wald ( 1947 ) , siegmund ( 1985 ) , brodsky and darkhovsky ( 1993 ) , and many others , assumes observations at fixed time points .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ model ] discusses the random walk model with local drift and the proposed monitoring procedure .",
    "section  [ rwar1 ] gives a brief discussion of the asymptotics for a stationary ar(1 ) process .",
    "section  [ asymptotics ] provides the new results about the control statistic under the random walk model for both the null hypothesis and the alternative .",
    "we also discuss general time designs in section  [ rwgeneraltimedesigns ] , which allow to thin a time series with respect to time .",
    "the results are applied in section  [ threshold ] to derive the related results for the sequential stopping procedures .",
    "section  [ optkernel ] studies the question of optimal kernel choice .",
    "finally , in section  [ sims ] we study the accuracy of the asymptotic distributions by simulations .",
    "we aim at detecting a nonparametric trend starting at a so - called change - point ( break - point ) in the presence of a pure random walk without drift . in this section",
    "we explain in detail the model , the proposed method and required assumptions .",

    "consequently , if @xmath23 does not vanish , for each fixed @xmath36 there is a change , but the percentage of pre - change observations tends to @xmath37 , as @xmath36 tends to @xmath38 .",
    "it will turn out that in this case the asymptotic limit depends on the function @xmath29 , but not on the change - point .",

    "the asymptotic limit will depend on the change - point parameter @xmath42 , too .",

    "although in this article we do not discuss the case of dependent innovations in detail , our results work under the following general assumption .",
    "* assumption ( a ) : * the stationary sequence @xmath11 ensures that the partial sum process @xmath53 , @xmath54 $ ] , converges weakly to scaled brownian motion , @xmath55 , for some constant @xmath56 which is determined by @xmath57 .",
    "it is worth to discuss assumption ( a ) .",
    "first , note that it covers weakly dependent innovations as arising in stationary arma or garch models , provided certain additional conditions are fulfilled .",
