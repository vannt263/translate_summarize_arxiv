    "the relativistic beam plasma system occurs in the context of many frontier research areas in both laboratory and space plasmas , such as the fast ignition scheme of inertial confinement fusion @xcite , compact particle accelerators @xcite , solar flares physics @xcite , cosmic magnetic field generation @xcite and magnetic field reconnection @xcite .",
    "therefore , the study of instabilities associated with the relativistic beam - plasma systems is of central importance in understanding issues pertaining to a better transport of beam electrons in the plasma and provide clues to improve upon it .",
    "the manuscript explores this in detail .",
    "when a short , intense laser pulse ( i@xmath2w/@xmath3 ) irradiates a solid target , a relativistic electron beam is generated through the process of wave breaking @xcite .",
    "this relativistic electron beam can propagate inside the plasma target even when the current associated with it exceeds the alfven current limit @xmath4 ka , here @xmath5 is the electron mass , @xmath6 is the electronic charge , @xmath7 is speed of light and @xmath8 is the lorentz factor of the beam .",
    "this is because simultaneously a return current is induced by the electrons of the background plasma which compensates the forward beam electron current .",
    "this combination of forward and return current is , however , highly unstable to two stream and filamentation instabilities .",
    "for the two stream ( longitudinal mode ) @xcite instability , the perturbations propagate parallel to the direction of the beam flow .",
    "when the perturbations propagate normal to the beam propagation direction they are termed as the filamentation instability ( transverse mode ) @xcite .",
    "this is also often known as the weibel instability @xcite .    in the general case",
    "the perturbation would propagate in a direction oblique to the beam and would have both filamentation and two stream characteristics .",
    "the instabilities associated with the obliquely propagating perturbations have been investigated in the cold fluid limit @xcite as well as by kinetic approaches @xcite .",
    "the particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations @xcite have been carried out to validate the results .",
    "it has been shown that when @xmath9 , relativistic effects come in to play and the filamentation instability dominates over the two - stream instability @xcite . a full hierarchical map showing the parameter regions ( ratio of the beam density to the plasma density and @xmath8 ) where these modes dominate has been provided in @xcite .",
    "the maximally growing mode amongst the spectrum of unstable modes determines the beam evolution and sets the stage for the subsequent non - linear evolution .",
    "in fact the magnetic field generation is also closely linked with these modes and occurs due to the current imbalance created by the most dominant modes of the instability .",
    "as the amplitude of the perturbations increase the nonlinear coupling defines the spectral cascade to other scales making the magnetic power spectrum turbulent in many scenarios .",
    "this in turn is detrimental to beam transport .",
    "there are many attempts at avoiding and/or suppressing such instabilities with are responsible for current separation .",
    "for instance , theoretical and experimental work on collimated propagation of electron beam assisted by resistivity gradient have been reported in ref .",
    "a recent experiment @xcite has demonstrated transport of mega amperes of electron currents through nano structured target over distances of the order of millimeter .",
    "the transportation of electron beam over such distances is possible only if the beam plasma associated instabilities are somehow suppressed and the separation between forward and return currents does not take place as rapidly as predicted by the growth rate of these instabilities . in a simplified 1-d treatment , the suppression of weibel / filamentation instability by the equilibrium density inhomogeneity ( due to the nanostructures ) has been shown in some recent studies @xcite . however , for the parameters of experimental system @xcite , typically the oblique mode would be the fastest growing mode @xcite . this necessitates a 2-d treatment wherein the role of plasma inhomogeneity on the growth of oblique mode should be investigated . such a study is the main objective of the work presented in this manuscript .",
    "we have carried out the linear analysis of the beam plasma instability in an inhomogeneous plasma medium by using the coupled maxwell and two - fluid electron equations in the relativistic regime .",
    "the inhomogeneity in the beam - plasma density has been chosen to have a sinusoidal profile orthogonal to the direction of the beam propagation .",
    "this inhomogeneous density mimics the scenario which would arise when a high power laser of intensity ( i@xmath2 w/@xmath3 ) incident on a structured target ionizes it .",
    "the propagation of the accelerated relativistic electron beam ( reb ) occurs at a very fast time scale at which the heavier ions are unable to respond and continue to maintain the inhomogeneous profile of their density .",
    "such a inhomogeneous background ion density constrains the flow of the beam and background plasma electrons .",
    "the linear analysis of the coupled fluid maxwell set of equation shows that when the plasma density ripples have a scale length less than the skin depth , the dominant oblique mode gets suppressed .",
    "we have also carried out a 2d pic simulations which corroborates with the linear results . with the help of pic simulations",
    "one has also been able to explore the nonlinear regime of the system .",
    "it is observed that magnetic field energy is comparatively lower for the inhomogeneous cases in the nonlinear regime .",
    "this further suggests that the current separation is weak when the plasma is inhomogeneous , conducive to the uninhibited propagation of the rebs .",
    "the manuscript has been organized as follows .",
    "the theoretical model ( coupled maxwell and two electron fluid ) and governing equation for linear analysis for the beam -plasma system has been presented in section ii .",
    "the growth rate of the unstable mode has been analyzed in section iii . in section iv ,",
    "the observations from pic simulation have been presented . a comparison between homogeneous and inhomogeneous density plasma is also provided which shows that if the scale length of the inhomogeneity is sharper than the electron skin depth the growth of beam plasma instability gets suppressed . in section",
    "v , we present our conclusions .",

    "the pressure @xmath18 is provided by the equation of state . in the above equations , velocity is normalized by the speed of light @xmath7 , density by @xmath19 ( the spatially average ion density ) , frequency by @xmath20 , length by electron skin depth @xmath21 and electric and magnetic field by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is electron rest mass and @xmath6 is electron charge .",
    "the subscript @xmath24 is @xmath25 for beam and @xmath26 for plasma .    in the equilibrium",
    "there is no electric and magnetic field , so there is complete charge as well as current neutralization .",

    "the background plasma is chosen to be cold ( @xmath28 ) in all our analytical as well simulation studies .",
    "thus , for an inhomogeneous case considered by us in this work we have the following conditions for equilibrium : @xmath29 @xmath30 in equilibrium beam pressure @xmath31 is chosen to be independent of x. this is achieved by choosing the beam temperature @xmath32 to be satisfying the following condition @xmath33 @xmath34 the suffix @xmath35 indicates the equilibrium fields .",
    "we linearize equations ( 1)-(4 ) to obtain linear growth rate of the instability .",

    "these studies , therefore , suggest that specially tailored targets incorporating appropriate forms of plasma density inhomogeneity can in fact be helpful for efficient transport of electron beam through plasmas .",
