    "they found that the presence of anisotropy contributes to the formation of the singularity .",
    "berkin s work shows that a quadratic weyl theory is less stable than a quadratic riemann scalar @xmath3 . in particular , in the very interesting article ref .",
    ", barrow and hervik addressed the anisotropic cases of bianchi @xmath1 and @xmath4 .",
    "the most interesting results of barrow and hervik are the exact solutions for quadratic theories of the same type investigated in this present article . instead of the metric , the field equations in ref .",
    "are written in a different set of variables which by now is a well known procedure used in the context of dynamical systems in cosmology.@xcite .",

    "speculations about the validity of the semi - classical argument can be raised , anyway , in a certain sense the quadratic counterterms which we consider are the most natural ones expected from the renormalization of a quantum field.@xcite    the purpose of this article is to cast the dynamical equations of motion in a 3 + 1 decomposition for the zero vorticity case .",
    "a time like and geodesic vector can be defined and we impose the homogeneity on the 3-space . apparently it is the first time the equations are presented in this form .",

    "we emphasize that the approach of this present work is facing the theory as an effective , and classical theory . while considering it as a candidate for a quantized gravity does introduces ghosts . which together with tachyons and the additional degrees of freedom in contrast to einstein s theory , makes it improbable that the bkl solution will be the generic one in this case .",
