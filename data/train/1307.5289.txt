    "<S> the katrin experiment , presently under construction in karlsruhe , germany , will improve on previous laboratory limits on the neutrino mass by a factor of ten . </S>",
    "<S> katrin will use a high - activity , gaseous t@xmath0 source and a very high - resolution spectrometer to measure the shape of the high - energy tail of the tritium - decay @xmath1 spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the shape measurement will also be sensitive to new physics , including sterile neutrinos and lorentz violation . </S>",
    "<S> this report summarizes recent progress in the experiment .    </S>",
    "<S> neutrino oscillation experiments show that the neutrino - mass eigenstates @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 are distinct from the weak - flavor eigenstates @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in the quasi - degenerate regime , where the mass splittings are small compared to the absolute mass scale , laboratory @xmath1-decay experiments can extract the antineutrino mass through a shape analysis of the high - energy tail of the @xmath1 spectrum , making no model assumptions apart from basic kinematics . </S>",
    "<S> previous efforts to perform such a measurement using tritium have yielded an upper limit of @xmath8 at 90% confidence , where @xmath9 is the mass of the @xmath10th neutrino - mass eigenstate and @xmath11 is an element of the neutrino mixing matrix .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the karlsruhe tritium neutrino ( katrin ) experiment will improve this sensitivity by a factor of 10 .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    figure  [ katrin_beamline ] shows the katrin beamline . </S>",
    "<S> the rear section ( a ) monitors the windowless , gaseous t@xmath0 source ( wgts , b ) , in which gaseous tritium decays in a magnetic field . a two - stage transport section ( c ) </S>",
    "<S> adiabatically guides @xmath1s along magnetic field lines toward a pair of spectrometers ( d , e ) . </S>",
    "<S> each spectrometer is a magnetic adiabatic collimating / electrostatic filter  @xcite . as @xmath1s travel from a region of strong magnetic field to a field minimum , </S>",
    "<S> their magnetic orbital moments remain constant while their momenta are rotated to be nearly longitudinal . </S>",
    "<S> a longitudinal retarding potential thus sets a kinetic - energy threshold for @xmath1s passing through to the detector ( f ) . by adjusting the retarding potential and thus the integration threshold </S>",
    "<S> , katrin will make a precise measurement of the tritium @xmath1 spectrum near the endpoint . </S>",
    "<S> the fit to the spectral shape will have at least four free parameters : the antineutrino mass , the @xmath1 endpoint energy , the signal rate , and the background rate .    here , </S>",
    "<S> we highlight some recent achievements of the katrin collaboration , from research and development to construction and commissioning .    the 10-m source tube , presently under construction , will use components of the wgts demonstrator apparatus , a prototype used to test aspects of the source design . using a cooling system based on neon thermosiphons , </S>",
    "<S> the demonstrator was maintained for a week at the design temperature of 30  k. the demonstrated temperature stability of @xmath12   h@xmath13 is a factor of 20 better than the design specification .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    the molecular composition of the source affects the source activity as well as the molecular final state after decay of a t atom . </S>",
    "<S> the laser raman ( lara ) system uses raman spectroscopy to continuously monitor the composition of the gas to be injected into the source . in a prototype of the circulation system , 0.1% precision was demonstrated in 250  s of acquisition .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    the commissioning of the pre - spectrometer revealed potential pitfalls in the spectrometer design . </S>",
    "<S> for example , ring - shaped background patterns were observed to accumulate over the course of several hours . through analysis , simulation , and dedicated runs , </S>",
    "<S> these were traced to radon atoms that escaped from the getter pumps and decayed inside the spectrometer flux tube . </S>",
    "<S> a shakeoff or internal - conversion electron from such a decay could be stored in the spectrometer for hours , slowly losing energy via collisions with residual gas molecules . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting low - energy secondary electrons were then accelerated by the retarding potential ; their distribution on the detector plane was ring - shaped due to the magnetron motion of the primary .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite with the identification of this new background source , the main - spectrometer design was modified to include liquid - nitrogen - cooled , radon - trapping baffles between the getter pumps and the main volume .    a two - layer wire electrode system containing 23,440  wires lines the 700-m@xmath14 interior surface of the main - spectrometer vessel , which is 23.8  m long with a maximum diameter of 9.8  m.  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this system improves field stability and allows fine shaping of the retarding potential . </S>",
    "<S> since the wire electrodes are held at a slightly more negative potential than the hull of the vessel , they also reduce background by preventing secondary electrons from entering the flux tube . </S>",
    "<S> this system has been installed and baked out to a temperature of 300@xmath15c .    </S>",
    "<S> the 0.93-ev design resolution of the main spectrometer is set by the ratio of the minimum magnetic field , in the central analyzing plane , to the maximum magnetic field at one end . in order to achieve a magnetic - field minimum of precisely 3  g </S>",
    "<S> , two sets of air coils have been installed around the main spectrometer .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the circular low - field - correction coils , which are coaxial with the main spectrometer , compensate for distortions due to residual magnetization and to fringe fields from the superconducting solenoids at either end . </S>",
    "<S> compensation for the earth s magnetic field is achieved by coils in straight sections , describing a cylindrical surface centered on the flux tube and joined by vertical endrings . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting magnetic field is monitored by stationary sensors and by robotic mobile sensor units that travel along the support structures for the low - field - correction coils .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    the focal - plane detector is a monolithic silicon pin diode ; its active area has a diameter of 90  mm . </S>",
    "<S> it is segmented into 148  pixels laid out in a dartboard pattern , allowing the characterization of inhomogeneities in the analyzing plane . </S>",
    "<S> a novel mounting structure  @xcite , in which electrical contacts are made by spring - loaded pogo pins , minimizes radioactivity in the region of the detector . with a built - in calibration source </S>",
    "<S> , we have demonstrated an energy resolution of @xmath16  kev ( full width at half maximum ) for electrons at the tritium @xmath1-spectrum endpoint energy of 18.6  kev .    in may 2013 , </S>",
    "<S> the main spectrometer and detector sections were connected for the first time , beginning an initial commissioning period to study backgrounds and the spectrometer transmission function . </S>",
    "<S> after hardware upgrades , a second commissioning phase will follow in 2014 , along with commissioning of the source and transport sections . </S>",
    "<S> we anticipate the start of katrin data - taking in late 2015 .    </S>",
    "<S> katrin expects to achieve a sensitivity of @xmath17  ev at the 90% confidence level in three full years of running , or approximately five calendar years . </S>",
    "<S> the precise spectral - shape analysis also gives potential access to new physics , including sterile neutrinos in the mass range suggested by the reactor antineutrino anomaly .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite endpoint measurements from previous tritium - based neutrino - mass experiments have recently been used to set limits on the coefficients of two lorentz - violating operators in the standard - model extension , which katrin could improve by two orders of magnitude  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the katrin measurement plan , which involves cycling through all retarding - potential measurements with a period of about 15  minutes  @xcite , will give access to the complex coefficient of an additional lorentz - violating operator that produces oscillations of the endpoint with a period of one sidereal day .  </S>"
