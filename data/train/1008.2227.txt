    "modern yearning for understanding the electronic properties of devices made out of materials in which spins play an important role has rekindled interest in the study of the two - dimensional electron liquid in the presence of rashba or dresselhaus spin - orbit coupling.@xcite to date , the effects of the electron - electron interactions in these system have been studied by means of approximated methods , notably the random - phase - approximation ( rpa ) and the mean - field theory.@xcite quasiparticles parameters were studied in refs .   while refs .   focused on the ground - state properties and mean - field phase diagram .",
    "recent studies of spatially inhomogeneous overhauser s type of instabilities ( chirality , charge and spin ) and of the spin - susceptibility in these systems can be found in refs .   and , respectively ( including non - analytic corrections@xcite ) .",
    "calculations of realistic systems of lower dimensionality in the presence of spin - orbit coupling have also been carried out by means of numerical density functional theory methods.@xcite however , for want of more accurate exchange and correlation functionals , the latter have been implemented by employing formulas for the energy of the electron liquid obtained in the absence of spin - orbit coupling , an approximation that a priori could appear at best rather crude . only recently",
    ", quantum monte - carlo numerical data of the energy were obtained for electrons in two dimensions with rashba spin - orbit coupling.@xcite    in this paper we analyze some formal aspects of the perturbative expansion in the electron - electron interaction , without magnetic field and under the assumption that the system will behave as a fermi liquid . in doing so we will show that certain exact identities lead to the conclusion that , at least in the high density regime or for small spin - orbit coupling strength , the effects of the interactions are only marginally influenced by the spin - orbit coupling . in particular we will show that , to all order in the electron - electron interaction , the corrections to the total energy and the fermi liquid properties formally vanish to lowest order in the spin - orbit coupling . as consequence ,",
    "our results lend some degree of justification and theoretical underpinning for many of the numerical studies carried out by neglecting such effects .    in ref .",
    "a canonical transformation was proposed for the case of small dots that allows one to renormalize the hamiltonian into one in which a generic combination of rashba and dresselhaus spin - orbit coupling terms only appears in second order .",
    "the vanishing of such spin - orbit interaction effects at small coupling was later verified within the rpa in ref .   for the self - energy .",
    "our analysis not only extends these results to the fully interacting case but also explicitly shows how the repopulation of momentum space with respect to the non interacting situation@xcite is responsible for the renormalization of the rashba and dresselhaus coupling .",
    "our formalism also sets the stage for a systematic analysis of the perturbation theory to all order for regimes in which the series is expected to converge .",
    "the specific application to the case of coulomb interaction in the high - density regime and a comparison of analytic formulas for the exchange and correlation energy to the numerical monte - carlo results of ref .   can be found in ref .  .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ basic_formalism ] we provide the definition of the model and the necessary notation ; in section [ energy_expansion ] we prove an exact identity concerning the dependence of the total interacting energy on the suitably defined density dependent bare spin - orbit coupling and the chirality , the relevant fermi surface repopulation parameter ; in section [ self_energy ] a similar relationship is obtained for the self - energy perturbative series ; finally , section [ discussion ] provides a discussion of our results .",
