    "good experimental and theoretical controls of the leptonic decay constants @xmath17 ( analogue to @xmath18 ) of charmed @xmath0 and beautiful @xmath19 ( pseudo)scalar mesons are of prime importance for understanding the dynamics of the heavy light quark systems ( overlap of the wavefunctions , heavy quark mass - behaviour , ... ) in qcd .",
    "many efforts have been devoted to this study both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "the leptonic partial width of the @xmath20 is normalized as : ( d_q^+l^+_l)=g_f^28|v_cq|^2 f^2_d_q m_l^2 m_d_q1-m_l^2m_d_q^2 ^ 2 where @xmath21 ; @xmath22 and @xmath23 are respectively the masses of the @xmath20 meson and of the @xmath24 charged lepton .",
    "@xmath25 is the fermi constant and @xmath26 is the ckm matrix element controlling the weak coupling of the @xmath27 and @xmath28 quarks .",
    "@xmath29 is the leptonic decay constant normalized like @xmath30 mev as : ( m_q+m_c)0||q_5 c    ( @xmath31 ) and the last factor in parenthesis is the familiar phase space factor . while the electron mode is tiny due to strong helicity suppression , the measurement of the @xmath32 mode involves the detection of additionnal neutrinos , such that , the muon mode is experimentally the cleanest and most accessible one",
    "therefore , we shall mainly consider the @xmath33 data which ( in principle ) provide the most precise measurements , and show for a comparison the one from @xmath34 decay .",
    "for determining @xmath3 from @xmath36 decay , it has become usual to assume that @xmath37 , which is an extra input in the analysis .",
    "in addition , the extraction of @xmath38 from @xmath39 is affected by the uncertainties on the value of the k - form factor , while @xmath32-decay data give a slightly different ( though consistent ) value @xcite .",
    "the good agreeement between the measured and theoretical values of @xmath3 @xcite , allows us to perform ( with a good confidence ) an opposite , though natural , procedure , by relying on the theoretical value of @xmath3 for extracting more accurately @xmath35 . by combining the most recent measured @xmath36 branching ratio from cleo @xcite : br(d^+^+_)= ( 3.820.320.09)10 ^ -4  , with the averaged value from lqcd and qssr  la svz @xcite given in table [ tab : fd ] , and using the @xmath40 lifetime of @xmath41 ps @xcite ,",
    "we deduce : |v_cd|= 0.2300.010_exp 0.009_th  , [ eq : vcd ] to be compared with :",
    "semileptonic decays of the light @xmath43 and heavy @xmath44 mesons have given most of the ckm mixing parameters . in the case of the process @xmath45 , ( @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) and ( @xmath48 ) , where one can neglect the ratio @xmath49 ,",
    "the differential rate can be expressed as : _ d^0p_q^- l^+_l = g_f^224 ^ 3p_q^3|v_cq|^2|f^dp_+(q^2)|^2  , where @xmath50 is the invariant mass squared of the @xmath51 system ; @xmath52 is the form factor and @xmath53 is the momentum of the light meson .",
    "cleo data lead to the result @xcite : = 0.188  ( 8)  ( 2 )  , where the errors are respectively statistical and systematical . in order to use this data",
    ", we update the value of the ratio of form factors from qssr @xcite by using the recent value @xmath54 mev @xcite instead of the one @xmath55 mev used in the original paper .",
    "we have also used the value of @xmath56 in @xcite  .",
    "then , we obtain : r_d = 1.110.07  , which has almost the same value as the previous one .",

    "some remarks are in order here : + the determinations of the ratio compared to the absolute values are always more accurate in the qssr calculations due to the cancellations of different systematics .",
    "the sensitivity to the higher state contributions ( continuum threshold - dependence ) , to pt radiative corrections ( which tend to cancel in the ratio ) , to the exact value of the charm quark mass ( absent to leading order ) , ... are less pronounced in the direct evaluation of the ratio than in each individual form factor .",
    "the dependence on the sum rule variable of the prediction is also weaker as shown in the figure of @xcite . +",
    "this value does not come from a numerical fit but from a semi - analytic expression where all different sources of corrections can be easily controlled .",
    "+ the sum rule used here has successfully predicted ( though with a modest accuracy ) the absolute value of the form factor @xmath63 for @xmath64 and of other semileptonic decays @xcite and the decay rate @xmath65  @xcite . + as a good illustration of this property , the lqcd recent most precise prediction of the ratio @xcite : f_d_s / f_d= 1.1620.009  , [ eq : fdsfdlatt ] agrees within a digit with the central value from qssr prediction obtained one decade earlier @xcite : . ] f_d_s / f_d= 1.150.04  , [ eq : fdsfd ] which is a strong indication on the reliability of the qssr approach despite its modest accuracy , for a crude estimate of the unknown @xmath66 corrections , which i wish will be available in the near future .",
    "however , after inspection of the analytic expression of the spectral function this crude estimate can give an overestimate of the true error . ] and a compatibility of the lqcd and qssr results as often encountered in different channels .",

    "+ comparing the experimental value of @xmath69 with the theoretical averaged lqcd and qssr determinations in eq .
