    "as an example we consider the case of free molecular regime of growth of embryos in a three dimensional space",
    ". then the rate of growth of the embryo with @xmath0 molecules inside in time @xmath1 is given by a standard relation @xmath2 here @xmath3 is some characteristic time and we extract the dependence on the density of the vapor phase via supersaturation @xmath4 which is @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the vapor molecules density , @xmath7 is the same characteristic for the saturated vapor .",
    "the value of supersaturation @xmath4 characterizes the power of metastability in the system .",
    "the analogous value which would be attained in the system without embryos formation will be denoted by @xmath8 .",
    "this value is completely determined by external conditions and , thus , is supposed to be known .",
    "the distribution of the embryos @xmath9 over their sizes can be taken as the stationary one and the following approximation for @xmath9 dependence on @xmath4 can be written @xcite @xmath10 here and later index @xmath11 marks values at some characteristic moment @xmath12 which can be chosen as the moment when the half of the total number of droplets is formed .",
    "the value @xmath13 is the derivative of the critical embryo free energy over the supersaturation multiplied by @xmath14 .    during the nucleation period one",
    "can use linearization of the ideal supersaturation and after the appropriate choice of scale @xmath15    here @xmath16 is rescaled time ( see @xcite ) .",
    "one can introduce @xmath17 ( @xmath18 is a constant @xcite ) and establish correspondence between @xmath16 and @xmath19 . under the collective regime of vapor consumption which takes place under the free molecular regime",
    "the conservation law for a substance can be written as @xcite @xmath20 with the appropriate value of the constant @xmath21 .",
    "then the curve @xmath22 has maximum at @xmath23 ( this can be regarded as a choice of @xmath24 ) .",
    "now we shall construct approximations for solution @xmath25 of ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "it is shown in figure 1 .",
    "precise solution for the size spectrum    this curve has a universal form which has been noticed in @xcite .",
    "the iteration solution of eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) was given in @xcite .",
    "the recurrent procedure is defined as @xmath26 with zero approximation @xmath27 .",
    "the first iteration for @xmath28 has the following form @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31    one can see that the first iteration is very close to the real precise solution which can be seen from figure 2",
    ".         precise solution and the first iteration for the size spectrum    the upper curve is the precise solution , the lower one is the first iteration .",
    "one can see that the first iteration is already a good approximation .",
    "now we shall formulate some new approximations with more simple physical sense .",
    "under the conditions of the metastable phase decay one can see in @xcite the similarity of conditions under which the embryos are appearing in the system .",
    "it was the consequence of the scale transformation of time .",
    "here the situation seems to be another .",
    "the time explicitly stands in the term @xmath32 for @xmath33 which characterizes the action of external forces .",
    "let us consider the subintegral expression in the integral calculated for the first iteration .",
    "the size @xmath34 of the embryo can be expressed as @xmath35 to observe the similarity we need to see the subintegral equation in the variable @xmath36 .",
    "the subintegral function @xmath37 in the expression for @xmath38 is the following @xmath39 factor @xmath40 is not more than a scaling factor and we have the universal expression @xmath41 for subintegral function in the first iteration . because the first iteration resembles the precise solution we see that the last relation means that conditions for appearance of the droplets in different moments of time are similar , only the scaling factors change .",
    "here it is nt clear how to use this property , but in the direct investigation of stochastic effects this property will be very useful .",
    "the universal form of @xmath42 is drawn in figure 3 .",
    "the universal form of subintegral expression for the first iteration for the size spectrum    we see that the maximum of subintegral expression is at @xmath43 and at @xmath44 the half of the maximal height is attained .",
    "this value can be regarded as some characteristic boundary .",
    "the other boundary is @xmath45 .",
    "the value @xmath21 corresponding to the maximum at @xmath23 was established after explicit numerical solution of ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "one can pose a question what value of @xmath24 corresponds to the maximum of the first iteration at @xmath23 . certainly , this procedure will lead to @xmath46 and to a shifted first iteration @xmath47 this iteration coincides with precise solution even better than the previous first iteration .",
    "it can be seen from figure 4 .",
    "the form of precise solution and the shifted first iteration    there are two curves : the curve with sharp slope corresponds to the shifted first iteration and the curve with smooth slope corresponds to the precise solution .",
    "let us calculate expression for @xmath48 according to ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "we shall use a monodisperse approximation .",
    "we get @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the coordinate of a monodisperse peak and @xmath51 is the number of droplets . for @xmath51",
    "one can propose @xmath52 for @xmath50 since the maximum occurs at @xmath53 one can get @xmath54    this forms the first variant of monodisperse approximation .",
    "it is not very precise because we have attributed the value @xmath55 to small droplets which are in a big quantity when we are near maximum of supersaturation .",
    "so , we have to correct our approximation .",
    "the region of integration to calculate @xmath51 can be cut off at @xmath56 . then the renormalized number of droplets formed until maximum of supersaturation is @xmath57 for @xmath58 one can assume that @xmath48 is negligible .",
    "this leads to the possibility to use the ideal supersaturation instead of the real one .",
    "then one can come to @xmath59 so , at every moment the number of droplets is @xmath60 and the coordinate of monodisperse spectrum is @xmath61 .",
    "then for @xmath62 one can get @xmath63 figure 5 illustrates this approximation , here the upper curve is the precise solution and the lower curve is the current approximation .",
    "the form of monodisperse approximation @xmath64 .",
    "the precision of approximation is satisfactory .",
    "this was only one variant of monodisperse approximation .",
    "now we shall present another variant . note that at every moment one can say that the droplet corresponding to the maximum of subintegral equation ( in the first iteration ) has a size @xmath65 three units greater than a current size .",
    "this leads to @xmath66    the form of spectrum is drawn in figure 6 .",
    "the smooth hill corresponds to the approximation , the sharp hill corresponds to the precise numerical solution .",
    "the form of monodisperse approximation @xmath67    the precision of the last approximation is satisfactory .",
    "earlier we constructed monodisperse approximations for every moment of time .",
    "now we shall take into account that the main quantity of droplets will be formed near the maximum of supersaturation , i.e. near @xmath68 .",
    "so , here we can put the position of monodisperse spectrum as @xmath53 .",
    "then one can state that the maximum of the model spectrum @xmath69 with parameter @xmath70 has maximum at @xmath68 .",
    "this gives @xmath71 .",
    "moreover one can move back from the shifted spectrum to the unshifted one by the substitution of @xmath72 instead of @xmath73 .",
    "then one can come to @xmath74 this spectrum together with the precise solution is drawn in figure 7 . here",
    "the sharp curve corresponds to the precise solution and the smooth curve corresponds to the approximation .",
    "it is seen that they are practically similar .",
    "the form of monodisperse approximation @xmath75    when @xmath76 one can come to @xmath77 this spectrum together with the precise solution is drawn in figure 8 . here",
    "the lower curve corresponds to precise solution and the upper curve - to approximation .",
    "it is seen that they are also practically similar , especially their forms .         the form of monodisperse approximation @xmath78    instead of @xmath79 we put @xmath80 or @xmath81 and conserve the fixed coordinate @xmath61 .",
    "the same can be done with approximations of the type @xmath64 and @xmath67 then we come to @xmath82 and @xmath83 we see that they coincide with @xmath75 and @xmath84 .",
    "they are drawn in figure 7 and figure 8 .",
    "so , we see that we can do the mentioned substitution at different steps of derivation .",
    "the next approach to construct some approximations will be based on the property which results in applicability of the first iteration .",
    "what is the physical reason of applicability of the first iteration instead of the precise solution ?",
    "the physical reason is the following : the embryos which are the main consumers of vapor were formed at initial moments of nucleation period when the supersaturation was near the ideal value .",
    "this allows us to extract the initial stage of nucleation period @xmath85 and the second stage which is the whole nucleation period except the initial stage .",
    "the second stage is the stage when the main quantity of embryos was formed .",
    "really @xmath86 is small in comparison with characteristic value of @xmath48 during the second stage @xmath87 .",
    "so at @xmath88 the supersaturation @xmath4 is close to @xmath8 .",
    "the influence of embryos appeared at initial stage on the evolution at the second stage is given through @xmath89    direct calculation on a base of the first iteration leads to @xmath90 @xmath91 @xmath92 @xmath93 then @xmath94 and the spectrum @xmath95 is drawn in figure 9 together with the precise solution which has more sharp form .",
    "the form of approximation of two stages together with precise solution .    here",
    "we forget that this expression takes place only for @xmath96 .",
    "we spread it for @xmath97 because here the spectrum is nt too high",
    ".    however , the asymptotic behaviour at @xmath98 will be qualitatively wrong .",
    "but as for the form of spectrum in a really significant region we see that the coincidence of two curves is practically ideal .",
    "the model forms of the size spectrum obtained above have to be self consistent .",
    "the self consistency can be treated at least in two senses .",
    "the first is the weak dependence of the total number of droplets on the number of droplets in the monodisperse peak .",
    "this question is separately analyzed directly in investigation of stochastic effects .",
    "here we shall see the weak dependence of the total number of droplets on the position of the monodisperse peak or on the position of the boundary between two stages of the nucleation period .",
    "we shall start with the model of the monodisperse peak .",
    "at first we shall generalize it .",
    "let the monodisperse peak be formed at @xmath99 .",
    "then instead of @xmath76 we have @xmath100 . for the size spectrum",
    "we get @xmath101 the total number of droplets we get the following expression @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the number of droplets appeared after @xmath99 .",
    "the last value can be calculated as @xmath104    in the renormalization adopted here the total number calculated on the base of precise solution is precisely equal to @xmath105 .",
    "the numbers @xmath103 and @xmath106 are drawn in figure 10 as functions of @xmath107 .",
    "it is clear that the dependence of @xmath106 on @xmath107 is very weak one .",
    "the same we shall do for the model of the two stage approach .",
    "we shall state that before the boundary @xmath99 the spectrum is the ideal one @xmath108 fot @xmath16 greater than @xmath109 the evolution is governed only by the substance accumulated in the droplets appeared before @xmath99 .",
    "this gives @xmath110 where universal momentums are given by @xmath111 @xmath112 @xmath113 @xmath114      the numbers @xmath103 and @xmath106 are drawn in figure 11 as functions of parameter @xmath107 of the boundary @xmath99 .",
    "one can see that the dependence of @xmath106 on @xmath107 is very weak one . moreover the number of droplets ( which is always greater than the precise value @xmath105 ) has minimum at @xmath117 .",
    "namely this value is the optimal one .",
    "we see that the value @xmath118 used in @xcite is very far from the optimal one ."
