    "spherical symmetric collapse of a scalar field was studied analytically by christodoulou @xcite who concluded that for near trivial initial data , the field disperses to future null infinity leaving an empty space - time , and for `` stronger '' initial data , the field implosion forms a black - hole .",
    "this result was verified numerically by goldwirth & piran @xcite .",
    "if we now characterize the `` strength '' of the initial data by some well defined parameter @xmath0 which is monotonously growing with the `` strength '' ( e.g. the initial amplitude of the field ) , we can expect that there will exist a critical value @xmath1 so that data with @xmath2 disperses while data with @xmath3 creates a black - hole .",
    "an intriguing question is what happens at @xmath4 .",
    "this question was investigated numerically by choptuik @xcite .",
    "his findings were    * in the limit @xmath5 the asymptotic behavior of the scalar field and the metric is _ universal _ - independent of the initial profile of the field .",
    "the field and metric also posses a symmetry - discrete self similarity ( dss ) in the neighborhood of the critical solution s horizon . *",
    "the dss is a periodical behavior at the origin with exponentially smaller periods in proper time : @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 being the time of formation of the critical black - hole , @xmath9 . * the mass of the black hole formed by marginally _",
    "super_critical data has a scaling law @xmath10 with @xmath11 .",
    "perhaps one of the striking conclusions from these findings is that it is possible to produce a black - hole with an infinitesimal mass .",
    "the limiting case zero mass black - hole , the `` choptuon '' can be viewed as a collapsing ball of field energy for which the rate of collapse is exactly balanced by the energy loss by radiation , so that when the ball shrinks to zero radius all of its energy is radiated away @xcite .",
    "the choptuon is actually a naked singularity , visible from null infinity @xcite although it is not generic and it is destroyed by an arbitrarily small perturbation .    hawking @xcite has shown that within the semi - classical approximation black holes evaporate thermally .",
    "the rate of evaporation depends on the black hole s mass via the relation @xcite : @xmath12 with the proportionality constant depending on the number of particle species that can be emitted by the black - hole at a given temperature .",
    "integration of this relation yields a black - hole lifetime which is proportional to @xmath13 .",
    "this suggests that quantum effects will change the choptuik effect since infinitesimally small black holes evaporate almost instantly .",
    "the semi - classical approach to gravitation stipulates that we can write the semi - classical einstein equation @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the expectation value of the effective quantum energy - momentum tensor .",
    "this approach has been tested to give rise to evaporation of the black hole satisfying eq .",

    "we explore the evaporation of a black hole formed by collapse of a scalar field and the effect of the evaporation on the choptuik phenomena . to this end , we investigate , numerically , the spherical collapse of a scalar field with the addition of an appropriate @xmath15 .",
    "we use @xmath15 adapted from a 2d expectation value that reproduces the hawking radiation @xcite .",
    "this in turn forces us to solve the evolution equations .",
    "this is significantly harder in our coordinates then the usual method of solving the constraint equations used in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in fact , this is the first time that a numerical solution using the evolution equations has been presented .",
    "another problem with the above @xmath15 is that the tensor is divergent at the origin .",
    "we renormalize the tensor to bypass this problem .",
    "this renormalization violates the bianchi identity near the origin however the semi classical approximation is not valid there anyway .",
    "the code is tested with the classical problem to reproduce the choptuik effect . after this",
    "we check black hole evaporation .",
    "finally we examine the effect of evaporation on the choptuik phenomena .",
    "the introduction of quantum effects via @xmath15 immediately introduces the planck length scale denoted here by @xmath16 .",
    "the addition of a length scale to the previously scale - less problem of the massless scalar field suggests that the critical phenomena present there will disappear @xcite .",

    "<S> the introduction of the planck length by the quantum theory suggests that the classical critical phenomena , which is based on a self similar structure , will disappear . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that when quantum effects are not strong enough , critical behavior is observed . in the intermediate regime , evaporation is equivalent to a decrease of the initial amplitude . it does nt change the echoing structure of near critical solutions . in the regime where black hole masses are low and the quantum effects are large , the semi classical approximation breaks down and has no physical meaning . </S>"
