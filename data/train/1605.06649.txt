    "in quantum information processing , quantum interfaces ( qis ) play a fundamental role in distributing quantum states between individual nodes of large quantum networks , which also offers potential applications for scalable and distributed quantum computation @xcite .",

    "qubits are stored in hyperfine states of atoms and then transformed into the number states of a photon wavepacket and vice versa @xcite .",

    "analogous magnetic cantilevers to which the spin qubit couples could be utilized for coherent sensing of mechanical resonators @xcite . in the two interfaces above ,",
    "laser pulses are used as the controlling tool , which requires bulky setups and makes them somewhat inconsistent in large - scale quantum information processing . here",
    "we propose an electrically tunable interface based on a suspended carbon nanotube quantum dot ( cntqd ) for implementation .",
    "+ cntqds are currently being investigated in a variety of systems , such as vibrational state control @xcite , ciruit qed @xcite , and coupling to cavity photons @xcite .",
    "the potential for carbon - based systems to be used in quantum information processing has been widely explored by exploiting different degrees of freedom in cnts and cntqds as quantum bits .",
    "for example , quantum information can be stored in the motional degrees of freedom of nanomechanical devices @xcite by creating single quantum excitations ( phonons ) in a resonator @xcite .",
    "it is also reliable to utilize the spin - orbit interaction with the valley degrees of freedom in cntqds @xcite . + we describe in this paper a quantum interface to realize the all - electrical control of coherent interconversion between optical qubits and the single electron spins in cntqds . in our work",

    "+ in addittion , the outstanding mechanical properties of cnt -low mass and noise @xcite , high quality factor , and widely tunable resonance frequencies @xcite , make it attractive to be used as a resonator in a qi .",
    "meanwhile , long spin life time of electrons in cntqds can be abtained off - resonance @xcite . in the resonant case",
    "though , the setup can accomplish qubit control and tranfer while gaining high operation fidelities , with the reduced charge noise - induced dephasing from the suspended cnt @xcite and further elemination of the hyperfine contributions to qubit decoherence .",

    "the heating of the nanotube resonator from the thermal bath reservoir is negligible and we find the effective interaction hamiltonian to be @xmath69 .",
    "meanwhile , the mechanical damping rate can be derived from @xmath70 with @xmath71 being the quality factor of the mechanical resonator . here , we take the resonance frequency @xmath72 as 360mhz and the quality factor @xmath73 with the resulting decay rate @xmath63khz @xcite in our simulations . with high quality factors of both cavity and cnt achievable today @xcite , we assume both the mechanical decay rate @xmath66 and the cavity leakage @xmath74 are small . the long spin life time in the qd",
    "is also expected off - resonance due to the low density of states at the spin energy splitting for the phonon spectrum of a suspended cnt .",
    "therefore , taking into account the intrinsic spin qubit dephasing @xmath75 and the cavity decoherence , the system dynamics can then be described by the effective non - unitary hamiltonian ^eff&=&h_0+_i^eff , + _ i^eff&=&_i - ib^b - ic^c - i .",

    "significantly , the pulse duration is rather short , about @xmath78 , due to the strong coupling @xmath79 .",
