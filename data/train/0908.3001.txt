    "the time is ripe to develop a comprehensive theoretical framework for substructure lensing that consolidates the various observables and reveals how they depend on physical properties of the clump population .",
    "the relevant framework is that of stochastic lensing , in which we treat the positions and masses of the clumps as random variables and compute statistical properties of lensing observables . while the application to dark matter substructure is new , there has been considerable formal work on stochastic lensing in the context of stellar microlensing .",
    "@xcite computed the variance of brightness fluctuations . @xcite and @xcite derived the probability distribution for the lensing shear , which @xcite used to find the probability distribution for the magnification .",
    "several studies considered the probability distribution for lensing deflections especially as they relate to the statistics of microlensing light curves @xcite .",
    "@xcite recently began a rigorous program to derive probability distributions for many different lensing quantities for an arbitrary number of stars ( i.e. , not necessarily in the limit of @xmath2 ) .",
    "all of those studies assumed the mass clumps have a probability distribution that is spatially uniform . while that approximation is reasonable on the scales that are relevant for stellar microlensing",
    ", it may not be appropriate for applications related to dark matter substructure .",
    "our goal in this paper is to generalise aspects of the theory of stochastic lensing to allow arbitrary spatial distributions of mass clumps .",
    "we also consider arbitrary mass functions , which have been explicitly examined in only some of the microlensing work ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "regardless of the spatial distribution and mass function , the lensing effects from a collection of mass clumps can be written as a superposition of effects from individual clumps .",
    "since the resulting sums contain many random terms , it is natural to wonder whether we can invoke the central limit theorem to argue that stochastic lensing can be described in terms of ( multivariate ) gaussian distributions .",
    "the answer , unfortunately , is no , because in some of the sums the individual terms have divergent variances .",
    "previous studies typically sidestepped this issue by using the characteristic function method to compute probability distributions .",
    "that method requires direct and inverse fourier transforms whose calculations are challenging but feasible in the context of a uniform spatial distribution .",
    "it is not yet clear how easily the characteristic function method can be generalised to arbitrary spatial distributions , so in this paper we adopt an approach that is simpler but still very instructive . the trouble for the central limit theorem can be ascribed to strong perturbations produced by clumps close ( in projection ) to an image .",
    "we treat these clumps explicitly by deriving full probability distributions for the _ most extreme _ perturbations produced by individual clumps .",
    "once we have isolated the troublemakers in this way , we can apply the central limit theorem to some subset of the remaining clumps ; we specifically consider clumps that are projected far from an image .",
    "we develop formal methods to treat these `` local '' and `` long - range '' regimes , which allow us ( 1 ) to draw general conclusions about how substructure lensing depends on the mass function and spatial distribution of clumps , and ( 2 ) to obtain analytic results that will serve as useful limits for an eventual complete theory of substructure lensing .",
    "let us be clear from the outset that we make certain simplifying assumptions in the analysis presented here .",
    "as in all previous formal work on stochastic lensing , we approximate the clumps as point masses , and we assume the clumps are independent and identically distributed .",
    "we gear the discussion toward applications that involve compact ( essentially point - like ) sources .",
    "we compute probability distributions for lensing quantities at fixed points in the image plane ( rather than for a fixed source position ) , because this is conceptually straightforward and also relevant for interpreting observed lenses in which the image positions are known .",
    "we address the utility and validity of these assumptions as they arise in the analysis , and mention possible extensions to the current work at the end of the paper .",
    "all key lensing quantities can be derived from the lensing potential , @xmath3 , which is a scaled version of the two - dimensional newtonian gravitational potential and is given by the poisson equation @xmath4 .",
    "( see @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for general reviews of strong lens theory . ) here @xmath5 is the projected surface mass density in units of the critical density for lensing , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 are angular diameter distances to the lens , to the source , and from the lens to the source , respectively .",
    "the lensing potential can be used to determine the time delay , defined to be the excess travel time compared with a light ray that travels directly from the source to the lens : @xmath10\\ ] ] where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the angular positions of the image and source , respectively , and @xmath13 is the redshift of the lens . by fermat s principle , images form at stationary points of the time delay surface ; the condition @xmath14 immediately yields the familiar lens equation , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the deflection vector .",
    "the distortion of a ( small ) image is governed by the magnification tensor , @xmath17^{-1 }    = \\left[\\begin{array}{cc }      1 - \\kappa - \\gamma_c & - \\gamma_s \\\\      - \\gamma_s & 1 - \\kappa + \\gamma_c      \\end{array}\\right]^{-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where subscripts on @xmath18 denote partial derivatives , e.g. , @xmath19 . in the second expression",
    "we have identified @xmath20 from the poisson equation ; this quantity is referred to as convergence because it describes the focusing of light rays .",
    "we have also defined @xmath21 these quantities are referred to as shear because they describe how an image is stretched by lensing .",
    "the potential ( @xmath18 ) , deflection components ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) , convergence ( @xmath24 ) , and shear components ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) are all linear quantities , meaning that each one can be written as a sum of contributions from different components of the mass model . in substructure lensing we write the full lens potential as @xmath27 the term @xmath28 represents the contribution from a smooth component that contains the majority of the mass of the galaxy .",
    "the term @xmath29 represents the potential from the substructure ( which is itself a sum of contributions from many individual clumps ; see ",
    "[ sec : complex ] ) .",
    "since the deflection components , convergence , and shear components are linear in @xmath18 , they can also be written as sums of smooth and lumpy terms : for example , we can write the full deflection vector as @xmath30 , and likewise for the convergence and shear .    any lensing observable",
    "that is based on image positions or time delays formally involves the time delay and lens equations ( eqs .",
    "[ eq : tdel ] and [ eq : lens ] ) , which in turn depend on the substructure potential and deflection .",
    "thus , for position and time delay observables it is sufficient to focus the theory on understanding probability distributions for @xmath29 and @xmath31 .",
    "lensing observables that involve the shapes and brightnesses of images , by contrast , involve the magnification tensor and the scalar magnification , which are nonlinear . to discuss the magnification , it is convenient to define second derivative matrices : @xmath32    = \\left[\\begin{array}{cc }      \\kappa{^{0}}+ \\gamma{^{0}}_c & \\gamma{^{0}}_s \\\\",

    "\\gamma{^{s}}_s & \\kappa{^{s}}- \\gamma{^{s}}_c      \\end{array}\\right]\\ ] ] the magnification tensor associated with the smooth component alone is ( cf .",
    "eq .  [ eq : mmat ] ) @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the @xmath35 identity matrix .",
    "the scalar magnification associated with the smooth component is @xmath36 the magnification tensor for the full model is @xmath37\\right\\}^{-1 }    = \\left({{\\bf i}}-{{\\bf m}}{^{0}}{{\\bf \\gamma}}{^{s}}\\right)^{-1 } { { \\bf m}}{^{0}}\\ ] ] here we have used matrix identities to simplify the expression , and recognised the factor @xmath38 .",
    "the simplified expression is useful when we write the scalar magnification associated with the full model : @xmath39 it is interesting now to consider the case when the convergence and shear from the substructure are small : @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 are all @xmath43 where @xmath44 .",
    "while this may not be true in general , the perturbative analysis can still offer useful insight .",
    "if we define the magnification perturbation relative to the smooth model , @xmath45 , we can write the fractional magnification perturbation as @xmath46 + { { \\cal o}\\left({\\epsilon}^{3}\\right)}\\ ] ] the final expression represents a taylor series expansion in @xmath47 , using the fact that each component of @xmath48 is @xmath43 so @xmath49 , while @xmath50 since the matrices are @xmath35 .",
    "( the series expansion would have a different form if the matrices had a different dimensionality . ) in the case of point mass clumps , @xmath51 so we can write the fractional magnification perturbation as @xmath52    + { { \\cal o}\\left({\\epsilon}^{3}\\right)}\\ ] ] we can take one more step by defining pseudo - polar coordinates for the shear : @xmath53 here @xmath54 and @xmath55 represent the amplitude and direction of the shear from the smooth component ; the factor of 2 enters the trig functions because shear is symmetric through a @xmath56 rotation ( and this is why we call these `` pseudo - polar '' coordinates ) .",
    "we can likewise define @xmath57 and @xmath58 to be the amplitude and direction of the shear from substructure .",
    "we can then use the identity @xmath59 to write the fractional magnification perturbation as @xmath60    + { { \\cal o}\\left({\\epsilon}^{3}\\right)}\\ ] ] there are several interesting conclusions to draw from this analysis .",
    "first , even the _ fractional _ magnification perturbation is proportional to @xmath61 ; and one of the second - order terms is actually quadratic in @xmath61 .",
    "a given substructure shear will therefore cause a stronger flux ratio anomaly in a more magnified image .",
    "the factor of @xmath61 means the sign of the fractional magnification perturbation depends on the parity of the image ( at lowest order ) .",
    "the sign is also affected , though , by the @xmath62 factor . to the extent that the direction of the substructure shear is correlated with the direction of the smooth shear",
    ", the @xmath63 factor will be more likely to have a positive sign , and so positive - parity images ( @xmath64 ) will tend to be brightened by substructure ( @xmath65 ) whereas negative - parity images ( @xmath66 ) will tend to be dimmed ( @xmath67 ) . if the directions of the smooth and substructure shears are uncorrelated , however , the fractional magnification perturbation will be equally likely to have either sign and so the parity dependence will be masked .",
    "another consequence of the cosine factor is that the fractional magnification perturbation is only sensitive to the component of the substructure shear that is `` aligned '' with the smooth shear ( for shear , `` aligned '' means either parallel or perpendicular ) .",
    "the `` cross '' component of the substructure shear ( i.e. , the component oriented at @xmath68 with respect to the smooth shear ) does not affect the magnification perturbation . all of these conclusions apply only at lowest order in the substructure shear , so they are not fully general , but they are interesting nonetheless .    even for arbitrarily large substructure effects ,",
    "( [ eq : dmusub ] ) shows that the magnification perturbation can be written in terms of the convergence and shear from substructure .",
    "more generally , we see from the discussion in this subsection that all of the key lensing observables can be written in terms of the substructure quantities @xmath69 ; thus , if we can determine the probability density for @xmath70 ( actually , the joint probability density for @xmath70 at all image positions ) we will have all the information we need to describe lensing observables . because of the linearity , @xmath71 does not depend on the smooth component , which means that we do not need to discuss the smooth component further . in the remainder of this paper",
    ", @xmath72 always refer to substructure quantities , and we drop the superscript `` s '' to simplify the notation",
    ".      lens theory naturally operates in two dimensions , and it is customary to treat positions and deflections as real vectors in a two - dimensional plane .",
    "however , it is also possible to think of that plane as the complex plane by combining coordinates @xmath73 and @xmath74 into the complex number @xmath75 we can also define the complex deflection and shear , @xmath76 note that we use tildes to identify these as complex quantities which are distinct from their scalar amplitudes , @xmath77 and @xmath78 . in various circumstances the complex notation can simplify lens theory ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , and we shall find it to be useful . in complex variables , the potential , deflection , shear , and convergence at position @xmath79 created by a point mass clump @xmath80 at position @xmath81 have the form : @xmath82 where the asterisk denotes complex conjugation , and @xmath83 is the dirac delta function .",
    "also , @xmath84 is the physical mass of the clump scaled by the critical surface density for lensing , so it is a quantity with dimensions of area . in the potential",
    ", @xmath85 is an arbitrary length scale that can be used to set the zeropoint of the potential .",
    "we discuss the zeropoint as needed below .",
    "the total substructure potential at position @xmath79 due to all clumps can then be written as @xmath86 and there are similar expressions for the total deflection , shear , and convergence .",
    "at times it is useful to convert from the complex notation into conventional polar coordinates . if we write @xmath87 then @xmath88 and @xmath89 have their usual relation to @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "we also consider polar coordinates centred on the position of an image by writing @xmath90 .",
    "if the image itself has polar coordinates @xmath91 , the two polar coordinate systems are related by @xmath92      in this paper we use point mass clumps , so each clump has a position , @xmath81 , and scaled mass , @xmath80 .",
    "the point mass approximation is valid for any spherical clump that does not overlap the line of sight , because the gravitational field outside such a clump equivalent to that of a point mass clump .",
    "there will be some correction for clumps that overlap the line of sight , but we leave for future work the development of a general theory that includes spatially extended clumps .",
    "( see @xcite for an analysis of magnification perturbations that can handle extended clumps . )",
    "the statistical properties of the clump population are specified by the joint probability density @xmath93 .",
    "we assume the clumps are independent and identically distributed , so the joint probability density can be written as a product of probabilities densities for individual clumps : @xmath94 this approach neglects possible correlations among clumps , but even if such correlations exist in three dimensions they will be suppressed to some extent by projection effects in lensing .",
    "correlations among clumps would further complicate the theory and so we defer them to future work .",
    "we also assume the positions and masses are separable , so we can write @xmath95 here @xmath96 is the spatial probability density , defined such that @xmath97 is the probability that a given clump is found within some area element @xmath98 around position @xmath79 ( in the complex plane ) . also , @xmath99 is the mass probability density such that @xmath100 is the probability that a given clump has mass between @xmath101 and @xmath102 ; the equivalent clump mass function is @xmath103 .",
    "numerical simulations suggest that mass and position may not be fully separable ; clumps in different mass ranges tend to have somewhat different spatial distributions due to effects such as tidal stripping and disruption ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such an effect could be accounted for in our formalism by dividing the clump population into several sub - populations by mass and using a different spatial distribution for each .    to gain a more intuitive understanding of the spatial probability density ,",
    "consider the mean surface mass density in substructure : @xmath104 here `` mean '' refers to averaging over many realizations of the substructure , in a sense that is formalised in appendix  [ app : stats ] ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : genavg ] , with @xmath105 from eq .",
    "[ eq : kapi ] ) .",
    "later in the paper we use this relation to replace the abstract quantity @xmath96 with the more physical quantity @xmath106 in spatial integrals .      even as we attempt to build a general theory of lensing with stochastic substructure , there are times when it is helpful to consider specific sample clump populations . for the spatial distribution ,",
    "one simple model we consider is a uniform distribution , @xmath107 defined over some large but finite area such that @xmath108 . the total number of clumps @xmath109 is basically interchangeable with the area over which @xmath110 is defined .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , the spatially uniform case allows us to connect with previous work on stochastic lensing .",
    "a second spatial model we consider is a power law distribution , @xmath111 the power law index is chosen such that the total mass in substructure within projected radius @xmath88 scales as @xmath112 . in terms of image - centred polar",
    "coordinates we can write @xmath113^{(\\eta-2)/2}\\ ] ] while the uniform and power law models do not necessarily match simulated cdm substructure populations in detail , they are useful pedagogical examples and sufficient for our purposes in this paper .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to understand how substructure lensing depends on clump mass , it is instructive to consider a finite mass range @xmath116 .",
    "the mean clump mass is then @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the dynamic range of the mass function . more generally ,",
    "other moments of the mass function have the form @xmath119 as we shall see , there is one combination of mass moments that arises repeatedly : @xmath120 this quantity has dimensions of mass , and has been referred to in microlensing as the `` effective mass '' ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we define a fiducial model whose spatial distribution is a power law with @xmath121 ( corresponding to an isothermal profile ) , and whose mass function has mean mass @xmath122 and dynamic range @xmath123 .",
    "we then construct variants with a steeper or shallower radial profile ( @xmath124 or 1.5 , respectively ) ; all models are normalised to have @xmath125 in the vicinity of the lensed images .",
    "we also construct other mass functions that have different dynamic ranges but are all normalised to have the same effective mass ( see table  [ tab : massfunc ] ) .",

    "column 3 gives the mean mass .",

    "all masses are given in units of @xmath129 .",

    "first , as in previous work on stochastic microlensing , we have explicitly assumed point mass clumps and neglected any correlations between clumps .",
    "while the point mass approximation is fine for clumps projected far from the lensed images , it will break down for clumps that overlap the line of sight ; this will have the greatest effect on the substructure shear , since that is mainly associated with clumps near an image ( see * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and allow correlations between clumps .",
    "second , this paper has implicitly focused on lensing of a point - like source .",
    "there are ways to treat an extended source in the context of microlensing ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , although the issues may be somewhat different in substructure lensing since the optical depth is generally lower and there can be complicated  and interesting``resonances '' that appear when the source size is comparable to the einstein radius of a clump ( see * ? ? ?",
    "once finite source effects are incorporated , this formalism could be applied to other problems in stochastic lensing such as planetesimal disk microlensing @xcite .",
    "there are several attractive opportunities to extend this work .",
    "we have already noted that there can be correlations among the various lensing quantities ( see   [ sec : long ] ) , and it would be interesting to see whether such two - point statistics contain additional information about the clump population . such an analysis could even be extended to higher - order statistics , although it is not clear when the data might be available to examine those .",
    "another goal would be to develop a more complete description of how the spatial distribution of clumps affects the various lensing quantities .",
    "we can think of this in terms of a spatial kernel that gives different weights to clumps at different distances from an image .",
    "we have identified the behavior of this kernel in the `` near '' and `` far '' regimes , but it would be nice to understand the full spatial kernel or at least identify the spatial moments that are most important for the total potential , deflection , and shear .",
    "in this appendix we specify how to compute averages over many realizations of the clump population .",
    "consider any quantity @xmath130 that is a sum of contributions from individual clumps , @xmath131 , where @xmath132 is the clump index .",
    "the general average over clump realizations has the form : @xmath133 the first step is the formal definition of the average over clump populations . in the second step we use the fact that @xmath134 and @xmath135 are normalised",
    "so they integrate to unity for @xmath136 . in the third step recognise that all terms in the sum are the same ,",
    "so we can replace the sum with multiplication by @xmath109 ; and we use eq .",

    "[ eq : poti][eq : shri ] ) , we can define @xmath138 to be a quantity that is independent of mass .",

    "there are @xmath148 elements in the second term ( sum over @xmath147 ) , and @xmath149 elements in the third term ( full sums over both @xmath132 and @xmath150 ) , yielding a total of @xmath109 elements with an overall minus sign .",

    "<S> mass clumps in gravitational lens galaxies can perturb lensed images in characteristic ways . </S>",
    "<S> strong lens flux ratios have been used to constrain the amount of dark matter substructure in lens galaxies , and various other observables have been considered as additional probes of substructure . </S>",
    "<S> we study the general theory of lensing with stochastic substructure in order to understand how lensing observables depend on the mass function and spatial distribution of clumps . </S>",
    "<S> we find that magnification perturbations are mainly sensitive to the total mass in substructure projected near the lensed images ; when the source is small , flux ratios are not very sensitive to the shape of the clump mass function . </S>",
    "<S> position perturbations are mainly sensitive to a characteristic clump mass scale , namely @xmath0 , with some mild dependence on other mass moments when the spatial distribution is not uniform . </S>",
    "<S> they have contributions from both `` local '' and `` global '' populations of clumps ( i.e. , those projected near the images , and those farther away ) . </S>",
    "<S> time delay perturbations are sensitive to the same characteristic mass , @xmath1 , and mainly driven by the global population of clumps . while there is significant scatter in all lensing quantities , there are some non - trivial correlations that may contain further information about the clump population . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that a joint analysis of multiple lens observables will offer qualitatively new constraints on the mass function and spatial distribution of dark matter substructure in distant galaxies . </S>"
