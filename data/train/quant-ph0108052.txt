    "finding the energy spectrum of a given hamiltonian is an important task in physics since it determines the dynamical and thermodynamical behavior of a quantum system . in solid - states physics , for instance , the spectrum , in particular its gaps , are relevant for the transport properties and in the famous bcs - theory @xcite the energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state is decisive for understanding super - conductivity .",
    "therefore a lot of efforts has been done on calculating the spectrum of many - particle hamiltonians .",
    "some models are known , where the hamiltonian can explicitly be diagonalized @xcite and advanced mathematical tools like non - commutative geometry could be shown to be useful for finding energy gaps in perfect crystals or those with defects and quasi - periodicity @xcite . nevertheless , the diagonalization of generic many - particle hamiltonians is computationally hard and even restricted information about its spectrum is difficult to obtain , since the dimension of the hilbert space grows exponentially with the number of particles .",
    "here we discuss how to obtain information about the spectrum of a hamiltonian by a quantum computer . apart from the fact that the algorithm is able to find energy gaps in many - particle systems efficiently ,",
    "it has a property which is impossible in principle without processing quantum information : we can gain information about the spectrum of a physical system with an _ unknown _ hamiltonian provided that there is an interface between the quantum register and the considered system for exchanging quantum information . if such an interface does not exist the algorithm can be used if the hamiltonian is known and the quantum computer is able to _ simulate _ the corresponding unitary evolution , i.e. , if efficient implementations of @xmath1 for each @xmath2 exist .",
    "then the algorithm can use those implementations as black - box subroutines .",
    "we restrict our attention to an unknown hamiltonian @xmath3 of the following form .",
    "let @xmath3 act on the hilbert space @xmath4 , which we shall refer to as the _ target register_. we assume @xmath3 to consist of 1-qubit terms and pair - interactions between the @xmath0 two - level systems , i.e. @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the pauli matrix @xmath8 acting on qubit @xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath10-matrix @xmath11 and the @xmath12-vector @xmath13 specify the interaction uniquely .",
    "first we should discuss why the problem can not be solved by a simple application of the well - known quantum algorithm for phase estimation @xcite .",
    "the reason is that the algorithm for estimating eigenvalues of a unitary @xmath14 does _ not _ work with black - box queries of @xmath14 , it relies on the _ quantum _ transformation @xmath15 implementing @xmath14 if and only if an ancilla qubit is in the state @xmath16 , i.e. , the ancilla qubit controls the implementation of @xmath14 .",
    "this causes severe problems if @xmath17 is the natural time evolution , since phase estimation would require a system with hamiltonian @xmath18 i.e. , the time evolution should be switched on and off by the ancilla s state .",
    "first of all it is not clear how to ` switch off ' the natural dynamics of a system , for example the interaction between nuclear spins in a real molecule .",
    "however , this problem can be solved if certain approximations are allowed as it is the case in standard decoupling techniques in nuclear magnetic resonance @xcite .",
    "assume that local transformations of the form @xmath19 can be applied arbitrarily fast ( ` fast control limit ' ) .",
    "if @xmath20 is applied before the system evolves according to its hamiltonian @xmath3 and @xmath21 is applied afterwards , then the system evolves as if it was subjected to the conjugated hamiltonian @xmath22 .",
    "concatenations of such ` conjugated evolutions ' for small time intervals make the system approximatively evolving as if it was subjected to the ` average hamiltonian ' which is given by the convex combination of the different conjugated hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "this technique can be applied for ` switching off ' hamiltonians @xcite . at first sight",
    "it might seem as if this technique could be applied to control @xmath3 by the ancilla s state .",
    "but this would require to substitute the sequence of decoupling local transformations by conditional transformations of the form @xmath23 with @xmath20 as eq .",
    "( [ vau ] ) .",
    "the assumption that @xmath24 could be implemented arbitrarily fast is much less justified than the usual fast control limit , since such a transformation refers to an interaction between ancilla and the target qubits and we have no reason to assume that this interaction is considerably stronger than the interaction which we want to switch off .",
    "in other words , there is _ no obvious _ way to convert @xmath3 into @xmath25 .",
    "below we present a scheme converting @xmath3 into @xmath26 , which has essentially the same effect .",
    "our assumptions are the following .    1 .",
    "the target register @xmath27 can be brought into interaction with a quantum computers register @xmath28 .",
    "this interaction acts on the same time scale as @xmath3 .",
    "the interaction between @xmath27 and @xmath28 can be switched off without disturbing @xmath3 .",
    "2 .   during that time period where @xmath27 interacts with @xmath28",
    "the hamiltonian evolution @xmath3 can be switched off .",
    "this decoupling is controlled by classical signals and not by a state of a quantum register .    in order to illustrate this assumptions we consider a molecule with @xmath29 nuclear spins .",
    "assume that the interactions between the spin pairs @xmath30 for @xmath31 are unknown and the interactions between all the other pairs are known .",
    "given an arbitrary subset @xmath32 , the following procedure can be applied for switching off all those terms in the hamiltonians concerning qubits in the set @xmath33 . for",
    "each qubit in @xmath33 choose vectors @xmath34 of equal dimension @xmath35 with the following property : the entries are @xmath36 and for each pair @xmath37 of vectors each pair @xmath38 with @xmath39 appear equally often in the list @xmath40 if @xmath41 is the @xmath42 entry of the vector @xmath43 . the vectors @xmath44 are said to form an _ orthogonal array _",
    "if @xmath45 than the time evolution of spin @xmath46 is conjugated by the unitary transformation @xmath8 during the @xmath42 time period , where we have used the convention that @xmath47 is the identity map . if the time periods are small , the resulting time evolution is approximatively the identity for all the spins in @xmath33 and those terms of @xmath3 which do not involve spins in @xmath33 are unchanged .",
    "then we consider the first @xmath0 spins as the target register with the unknown hamiltonian @xmath3 and the other spins form the quantum computer s register @xmath28 .",
    "the total hamiltonian will be of the same form as eq .",
    "( [ jform ] ) characterized by a @xmath48vector @xmath13 and a @xmath49matrix @xmath11 .    in order to switch off the interaction between @xmath27 and @xmath28",
    "we choose @xmath50 .",
    "then the unknown hamiltonian @xmath3 on the spins @xmath51 is remaining .",
    "if the hamiltonian on the target register should be switched off in such a way that the interaction between one specific qubit @xmath52 in the target register and one specific qubit @xmath53 in the ancilla register remains , one has to take @xmath33 as the complement of the set @xmath54 .",
    "note that this does not remove the 1-qubit terms @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "this is important since @xmath56 is unknown and is therefore disturbing if we want to implement a definite 2-qubit transformation on the qubit pair @xmath57 .",
    "therefore we have to switch it off .",
    "this can be done as follow .",
    "the interaction between @xmath46 and @xmath53 is given as @xmath58 choose a specific pair @xmath59 such that @xmath60 .",
    "cancel all the terms @xmath61 with @xmath62 by conjugation of the evolution with the 4 unitaries @xmath63 on @xmath64 time periods of equal length .",
    "the result is that the term @xmath65 is remaining .",
    "the 1-qubit terms can be cancelled by conjugating the evolution with @xmath66 for half of the time period with @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "since this changes the sign of the operators @xmath56 ( by the anti - commutation property of the pauli - matrices ) and @xmath69 , the bilinear term @xmath70 is unchanged .",
    "this shows that the assumptions 1 .   and 2 .",
    "above are justified .",
    "note that it is not relevant which interaction between ancilla qubits and register is available .",
    "if the true physical interaction is @xmath71 then it can be converted into each other hamiltonian with coefficients @xmath72 ( see @xcite ) in the sense of the ` average hamiltonian ' method .",
    "hence , if we write ` switch on the interaction @xmath73 ' we do not assume the real physical hamiltonian to be of this form , we assume only that the true hamiltonian of the system can be used for simulating the required term .",
    "this is the continuous analogue of the usual way of describing algorithms by basic gates as ` controlled not ' operations : it does not matter whether the quantum computer really has the ` controlled not ' as a basic operation but it should be capable of ` simulating ' it by those transformations which are really available . our way of describing the algorithm by ` switching on and off interactions ' should therefore only be considered as a convenient _ language _ for continuous quantum algorithms .",
    "first we consider only one ancilla qubit and describe how to convert the hamiltonian @xmath74 into the conditional hamiltonian @xmath75 controlled by the ancilla s state .",
    "we can switch off all the coupling except of those on one specific qubit pair @xmath76 by so - called selective decoupling @xcite .",
    "furthermore we can select those terms in the remaining hamiltonian which contain only @xmath56 and @xmath77 for specific @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the remaining term is given by @xmath80 first we convert @xmath81 into the term @xmath82 this can be done by dividing the considered small time interval @xmath83 $ ] into two intervals @xmath84 $ ] and @xmath85 $ ] . during the first interval the evolution according to @xmath81",
    "is conjugated by @xmath70 .",
    "this reverses the sign of the 1-qubit terms whereas the 2-qubit term is unchanged . during the second interval the evolution according to @xmath81",
    "is applied .",
    "now we can describe the conversion into a controlled hamiltonian . by identifying @xmath86",
    "with the additive group @xmath87 it can be explained as follows .    1 .",
    "apply the unitary transformation @xmath88 defined by the equation @xmath89 2 .",
    "apply time evolution corresponding to @xmath90 for a small time period @xmath91 .",
    "3 .   switch on the interaction between target and ancilla qubit given by @xmath92 for the time @xmath91 .",
    "4 .   simulate evolution according to @xmath93 for the time @xmath91 .",
    "inverting unknown hamiltonians is described in @xcite . in our case",
    "the inversion subroutine can be reduced as follows .",
    "choose a large number @xmath94 .",
    "divide the time interval @xmath95 $ ] into @xmath96 intervals of equal length . during the interval @xmath97",
    "conjugate the evolution according to @xmath90 by the unitary transformations @xmath98 if @xmath97 is @xmath99 or @xmath100 mod 2 , respectively . in the limit @xmath101",
    ", we obtain a perfect simulation of the evolution according to @xmath102 .",
    "switch on the interaction @xmath103 for the time @xmath91",
    "apply @xmath104 .",
    "repeat steps 1 to 6 with qubit @xmath9 .",
    "up to an error of order @xmath105 this simulates the time evolution corresponding to @xmath106   u^\\dagger_j + i u_k [ h'_{j , k , \\alpha,\\beta }   , h_j ]    u^\\dagger_k   = 2 h''_{j , k,\\alpha , \\beta } \\otimes \\sigma_z\\ ] ] for the time @xmath107 with the definition @xmath108    due to the equation @xmath109 the concatenation of the above procedure for all unordered pairs @xmath76 and all @xmath110 simulates time evolution according to @xmath111    note that the time required for obtaining the unitary transformation @xmath112 goes to zero for @xmath113 but the time _ overhead _ required for this simulation depends on the desired accuracy since the resulting evolution is only of second order a non - trivial one . note that @xmath114 can also be converted into @xmath115 by a conjugation of the evolution with an appropriate 2-qubit gate acting on qubit @xmath9 and the ancilla qubit , since @xmath116 and @xmath117 have the same spectrum as operators on 2 qubits . but this kind of converting the hamiltonian into a conditional one does not have the property that an infinitesimal time step of the algorithm requires only infinitesimal time . whether this is a true disadvantage for the desired accuracies has to be checked by thorough numerics .",
    "now we can apply usual phase estimation procedure to the conditional hamiltonian evolution .",
    "now we initialize the ancilla register by a hadamard transformation on each qubit .",
    "we implement the transformation @xmath118 for each ancilla qubit @xmath119 .",
    "the total running time of this implementation is @xmath120 times the time overhead for simulating @xmath121 with appropriate accuracy .",
    "we choose @xmath122 in such a way that @xmath123 if @xmath124 is an upper bound for the difference between greatest and smallest eigenvalue of @xmath3 given by prior knowledge .",
    "for every known systems in many - particle physics , @xmath124 is always of the order of @xmath0 , since energy per particle is a well - defined quantity in the thermodynamic limit @xmath125 .",
    "the size @xmath126 of the ancilla register has to be chosen in such a way that @xmath127 is smaller than the desired accuracy of the energy measurement .",
    "it is convenient to consider the ancilla qubit @xmath46 as the @xmath128 number of a binary digit .",
    "then the initial state of @xmath28 can be written as @xmath129 if the target register is in an eigenstate of @xmath3 with eigenvalue @xmath130 we obtain ( up to an irrelevant global phase ) the ancilla state @xmath131 since @xmath132 produces a relative phase difference @xmath133 between the ancilla states @xmath134 and @xmath16 .    by inverse fourier transformation ,",
    "one obtains the state latexmath:[\\[\\frac{1}{2^m } \\sum_{k , l } e^{-i 2\\pi kl/(2^m)}e^{i2e\\tau }     provides good estimations for @xmath130 since the probability that the measured result @xmath136 differs more than @xmath137 from @xmath138 is less than @xmath139@xcite . if @xmath140 is much smaller than the energy gaps of @xmath3 , the algorithm projects onto the eigenstates of @xmath3 @xcite . for large @xmath0",
    ", we can not expect this to be achievable since the gaps decrease exponentially with @xmath0 in the generic case .",
    "however , in this case the algorithm can be used for estimating the _ density of energy states _ , since the measured results will mostly be around those energy values where the density is high , provided that the target register has been initialized in the maximally mixed state . estimating the density of states is an important task in solid - state physics @xcite and spectral gaps can be detected by this method .",
    "most interesting energy gaps in solid states physics do not depend on the number of particles @xcite .",
    "they could be detected without increasing the size of the ancilla register .",
    "but one should emphasize that only those gaps can be detected which are localized around _ typical _ energy values according to the initial density matrix",
    ". therefore it might be more useful to start with thermal equilibrium states in the target register in order to find gaps around values which are typical for the desired temperature .",
    "we should mention a difficulty which appears for large @xmath0 and how it could be overcome .",
    "we assumed that each qubit in the target register can be brought into interaction with each qubit of the ancilla register . keeping in mind the example with nuclear spins in a molecule",
    ", one should take into account that the strength of the interactions is strongly decreasing with the distance between the spins .",
    "accordingly , the interaction time between ancilla and target spin has to be increased for large distances and the resulting running time might become unacceptable . therefore we emphasize that the algorithm can be rewritten in such a way , that it is not necessary to have an interaction between each qubit in @xmath27 and each qubit in @xmath28 .",
    "instead , one can transfer the information qubit by qubit into a quantum register . to speak",
    "more precisely , one can realize the algorithm within the following setting _",
    "instead _ of assumptions 1 ) and 2 ) above :    1 .   apart from @xmath28",
    ", there is a quantum register @xmath141 with @xmath0 qubits such that the ` information exchange ' @xmath142 can be implemented at definite times in such a way that @xmath1 can be implemented on @xmath141 by the following subroutine : * implement @xmath143 .",
    "* wait the time @xmath144 .",
    "* implement @xmath143 .",
    "the system @xmath145 has full capabilities of quantum computation",
    ".    then @xmath27 can be substituted by @xmath141 if the instruction ` wait the time @xmath144 ' is substituted by the subroutine above . due to the quantum computation capabilities on @xmath145",
    "we can clearly implement any desired transformation of the form @xmath146 for all @xmath147 between any arbitrary qubit pair .",
    "this shows once more that instructions of the form ` switch on the interaction @xmath148 ' as above should not be taken to literally .",
    "having full capabilities of quantum computation , we can clearly implement unitary evolutions corresponding to the interaction @xmath148 .",
    "the best way of ` simulating ' this interaction is hardware - dependent .    in order to estimate the running time of the algorithm one should keep in mind that @xmath149 interaction terms have to be coupled to the ancilla register ( the selection of specific coupling does not produce any time overhead @xcite ) .",
    "the time for converting one interaction term into a conditional one seems to be independent of @xmath0 at first sight . but here might come in a subtle @xmath0-dependence as well : it is possible that the simulation of one term @xmath150 has to be more exact if one wants to find spectral gaps for large @xmath0 .",
    "estimating the error in the eigenvalues of the total hamiltonian resulting from an error in the simulation of each coupling might be a difficult task of perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "but the error of the total hamiltonian is only @xmath151 times the error of the single coupling terms .",
    "since we are interested in of gaps of the order 1 , it should be possible to reproduce them with polynomial time overhead .",
    "the algorithm shows a nice application of ` simulations of hamiltonians ' @xcite : the algorithm can used to find eigenvalues of hamiltonians by simulating the corresponding unitary evolution on a quantum computer .",
    "apart from its possible application in many - particle physics , the algorithm shows a new aspect for understanding the double - role of self - adjoint operators as observables and generators of transformations , since we have constructed a measurement procedure for @xmath3 by using the evolutions @xmath1 as black - box procedures .",
    "this gives a new scheme for measuring non - trivial joint observables .",
    "the reader might get confused about one little paradox : we claimed to measure the actual energy value of the system despite the fact that only energy _",
    "differences _ have physical relevance ( as long as general relativity is not involved ) .",
    "this paradox is resolved by specifying more precisely what the algorithm does .",
    "we assumed the hamiltonian @xmath3 to be traceless .",
    "in case we start with a non - traceless one , only the traceless part will survive the conversion procedure @xmath152 . hence the algorithm measures the difference between the actual energy and the trace of @xmath3 , i.e. , the average of the energy values over all the states .",
    "this seems again to be paradox : in case the system is in a definite eigenstate , why can the ancilla register ` feel ' the average energy over all the other states despite the fact that the system never deviates from its actual eigenstate ?",
    "this paradox is only pretended by the ` infinitesimal language ' .",
    "of course the system _ does _ deviate a little bit from the actual eigenstate _ during _ the algorithm .",
    "note that the procedure simulating @xmath153 consists of a long sequence of transformations ( close to the identity ) which do not leave the eigenstates of @xmath3 invariant .",
    "thanks to p. wocjan for useful corrections .",
    "part of this work has been supported by the european project q - acta and the dfg - project ` verlustarme informationsverarbeitung ' ."
