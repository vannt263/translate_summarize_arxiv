    "the study of chaotic behaviour in classical dynamical systems is dating back to lobachevsky and hadamard who have been studied the exponential instability property of geodesics on manifolds of negative curvature and to poincare , who initiated the inquiry into the stability of the solar system .",
    "one believes now that the main features of chaotic behaviour in the classical dynamical systems are rather well understood , see for example @xcite .",
    "however the status of `` quantum chaos '' is much less clear although the significant progress has been made on this front .",
    "sometimes one says that an approach to quantum chaos , which attempts to generalize the classical notion of sensitivity to initial conditions , fails for two reasons : first there is no quantum analogue of the classical phase space trajectories and , second , the unitarity of linear schrodinger equation precludes sensitivity to initial conditions in the quantum dynamics of state vector .",
    "let us remind , however , that in fact there exists a quantum analogue of the classical phase space trajectories .",
    "it is quantum evolution of expectation values of appropriate observables in suitable states .",
    "also let us remind that the dynamics of a classical system can be described either by the hamilton equations or by the liner liouville equations . in quantum theory",
    "the linear schrodinger equation is the counterpart of the liouville equation while the quantum counterpart of the classical hamilton s equation is the heisenberg equation .",
    "therefore the study of quantum expectation values should reveal the chaotic behaviour of quantum systems . in this paper",
    "we demonstrate this fact for the quantum baker s map .",
    "if one has the classical hamilton s equations    @xmath0    then the corresponding quantum heisenberg equations have the same form    @xmath1    where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are quantum canonical operators of position and momentum . for the expectation",
    "values one gets the ehrenfest equations    @xmath4    note that the ehrenfest equations are classical equations but for nonlinear @xmath5 they are neither hamiltonian s equations nor even differential equations because one can not write @xmath6 as a function of @xmath7 and @xmath8 however these equations are very convenient for the consideration of the semiclassical properties of quantum system .",
    "the expectation values @xmath7 and @xmath9 are functions of time and initial data .",
    "they also depend on the quantum states .",
    "one of important problems is to study the dependence of expectation values from the initial data . in this paper",
    "we will study this problem for the quantum baker s map .",
    "the main objective of `` quantum chaos '' is to study the correspondence between classical chaotic systems and their quantum counterparts in the semiclassical limit @xcite@xmath10 the quantum - classical correspondence for dynamical systems has been studied for many years , see for example@xcite and reference therein .",
    "a significant progress in understanding of this correspondence has been achieved in the wkb approach when one considers the planck constant @xmath11 as a small variable parameter .",
    "then it is well known that in the limit @xmath12 quantum theory is reduced to the classical one @xcite .",
    "however in physics the planck constant is a fixed constant although it is very small .",
    "therefore it is important to study the relation between classical and quantum evolutions when the planck constant is fixed .",
    "there is a conjecture @xcite that a characteristic timescale @xmath13 appears in the quantal evolution of chaotic dynamical systems . for time",
    "less then @xmath13 there is a correspondence between quantum and classical expectation values , while for times greater that @xmath13 the predictions of the classical and quantum dynamics no longer coincide .",
    "the important problem is to estimate the dependence @xmath13 on the planck constant @xmath14 probably a universal formula expressing @xmath13 in terms of @xmath11 does not exist and every model should be studied case by case .",
    "it is expected that certain quantum and classical expectation values diverge on a timescale inversely proportional to some power of @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "other authors suggest that a breakdown may be anticipated on a much smaller logarithmic timescale @xcite .",
    "the characteristic time @xmath13 associated with the hyperbolic fixed points of the classical motion is expected to be of the logarithmic form @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the lyapunov exponent and @xmath17 is a constant which can be taken to be the classical action . such the logarithmic timescale has been found in the numerical simulations of some dynamical models.@xcite . it was shown also that the discrepancy between quantum and classical evolutions is decreased by even a small coupling with the environment , which in the quantum case leads to decoherence @xcite",
    ".    the chaotic behaviour of the classical dynamical systems is often investigated by computing the lyapunov exponents .",
    "an alternative quantity measuring chaos in dynamical systems which is called the chaos degree has been suggested in @xcite in the general framework of information dynamics @xcite .",
    "the chaos degree was applied to various models in @xcite .",
    "an advantage of the chaos degree is that it can be applied not only to classical systems but also to quantum systems as well .    in this work we study the chaotic behaviour and the quantum - classical correspondence for the baker s",
    "map @xcite .",
    "the quantum baker s map is a simple model invented for the theoretical study of quantum chaos .",
    "its mathematical properties have been studied in numerical works . in particular its semiclassical properties",
    "have been considered @xcite , quantum computing and optical realizations have been proposed @xcite , various quantization procedures have been discussed @xcite , a symbolic dynamics representation has been given @xcite .",
    "it is well known that for the consideration of the semiclassical limit in quantum mechanics it is very useful to use coherent states .",
    "we define an analogue of the coherent states for the quantum baker s map .",
    "we study the quantum baker s map by using the correlation functions of the special form which corresponds to the expectation values of weyl operators , translated in time by the unitary evolution operator and taken in the coherent states .    to explain our formalism we first discuss the classical limit for correlation functions in ordinary quantum mechanics .",
    "correspondence between quantum and classical expectation values for the baker s map is investigated and it is numerically shown that it is lost at the logarithmic timescale . the chaos degree for the quantum baker s map",
    "is computed and it is demonstrated that it describes the chaotic features of the model . the dependence of the chaos degree on the planck constant is studied and the correspondence between classical and quantum chaos degrees is established .",
    "in this section we discuss an approach to the semiclassical limit in quantum mechanics by using the coherent states , see @xcite .",
    "then in the next section an extension of this approach to the quantum baker s map will be given .",

    "let us notice that for time @xmath51 the quantum expectation value @xmath52 is equal to the classical one :    @xmath53    for any @xmath14 we are going to compare the time dependence of two real functions @xmath54 and @xmath50 these functions are approximately equal .",
    "the important problem is to estimate for which @xmath55 the large difference between them will appear .",
    "it is expected that certain quantum and classical expectation values diverge on a timescale inversely proportional to some power of @xmath11 @xcite .",

    "one of very interesting examples @xcite of classical systems with chaotic behaviour is described by the hamiltonian function    @xmath56 the consideration of this classical and quantum model within the described framework will be presented in another publication .",
    "the classical baker s transformation maps the unit square @xmath57 @xmath58 onto itself according to    @xmath59 this corresponds to compressing the unit square in the @xmath60 direction and stretching it in the @xmath61 direction , while preserving the area , then cutting it vertically and stacking the right part on top of the left part .",
