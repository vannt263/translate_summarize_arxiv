    ", we define a system of coordinates linked to the cloud in which @xmath29 is along the cloud axis ( with @xmath30 ) .",

    "since the speed of an mc is nearly in the sun - earth direction and it is much larger than the spacecraft speed ( which can be supposed to be at rest during the cloud observing time ) , we assume a rectilinear spacecraft trajectory in the cloud frame . the trajectory defines a direction @xmath34 ( pointing toward the sun ) ; then , we define @xmath35 in the direction @xmath36 and @xmath37 completes the right - handed orthonormal base ( @xmath38 ) .",

    "however , when the cloud presents a strong expansion , as in the event studied here , the directions derived by the mv method will mix two different effects in the variance of @xmath12 : ( 1 ) the effect of the coherent rotation of @xmath12 ( which provides the cloud orientation ) , and ( 2 ) the effect of the cloud aging ( the decrease of the field strength with time due to magnetic flux conservation combined with cloud expansion ) .",
    "this latter effect is not associated with the cloud orientation ; thus , we apply the mv technique to @xmath51 to decrease the cloud aging consequences .",

    "an axial expansion is characterized by @xmath63 in the front , changing to @xmath64 in the back .",
    "this is just what is observed in our case when the mean value of @xmath60 is removed within the cloud .",
    "this gives us the clue that @xmath32 is larger than 270@xmath33 .",
    "when the spacecraft crosses a cylindrical mc ( or an elliptical one with one of the main axis parallel to the sun - earth direction ) and @xmath44 , @xmath65 .",
    "the first panel in figure  [ fig_bv_cloud ] shows that the observed @xmath66 has a slightly negative mean value .",
    "the sign of @xmath66 , together with the evolution of @xmath57 , implies that the flux rope axis is above the ecliptic plane .",
    "in this section we summarize and extend the direct method presented by .",
    "this method lets us find the rear boundary of a flux rope for a given axis orientation , or the reverse , the mc orientation for a given position of the rear boundary .",
    "the front boundary of a flux rope is usually well defined by a discontinuity of the magnetic field ( changing abruptly from a fluctuating field in the mc sheath to a strong and coherent field within the mc ) .",
    "the corresponding current sheet is expected to be present all around the flux rope as the limit between magnetic regions with different magnetic connectivities ; so , with different magnetic stresses . a corresponding magnetic discontinuity , labeled `` out '' ,",
    "is then expected at the rear of the mc .",
    "the flux rope is present in between these two discontinuities and the same amount of azimuthal flux is traversed twice by the spacecraft .",
    "let us consider a flux rope at a given time .",
    "the conservation of the magnetic flux ( @xmath67 ) across a plane formed by the spacecraft trajectory and @xmath68 ( @xmath69 constant ) gives @xcite : @xmath70 with @xmath71 being the spatial coordinates in the @xmath72 and @xmath68 directions , respectively .",
    "the observations provide only @xmath41 as a function of time along the trajectory .",
    "so , we need two hypothesis : an invariance of @xmath41 along the flux rope axis and the conservation of the magnetic flux with time",
    ". the first hypothesis is justified by a low ratio of the mc radius over the expected curvature radius of the axis and the balance of magnetic torques , which is expected to homogenize the field along the axial direction @xcite .",
    "the second hypothesis is valid as far as the amount of magnetic flux reconnected during the spacecraft crossing is low .",
    "indeed , we have found that magnetic flux is reconnected in the front of the mc ( see section  [ direct_method_icme_structure ] ) .",
    "an estimation of the amount of flux reconnected during the spacecraft crossing gives @xmath73 5% of the initial azimuthal flux ( see section  [ direct_method_reconnection ] ) ; so , unless the reconnection rate is much higher during the observing time than it was during the travel from the sun , the amount of reconnected flux is small during the crossing .",
    "we neglect below such reconnected flux .",
    "the elementary flux crossed during @xmath74 is @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the axial length of the portion of the flux rope which had a length @xmath77 when the spacecraft entered the mc .",
    "then , equation  ( [ byflux ] ) becomes : @xmath78    if the axis orientation and the position of one boundary of an mc are known , the above flux balance property can be used to find the mc center and the other boundary as follows .",
    "we define the accumulative flux per unit length : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the time of the mc front boundary ( located at @xmath81 ) and @xmath82 .",
    "the position where @xmath83 has its absolute extreme gives an estimation of the position where the spacecraft reaches the closest distance to the mc axis .",
    "this indicates the @xmath84 position of the mc center , being this estimation more precise as the impact parameter is lower .",
    "then , when @xmath85 goes back to zero at @xmath86 , we have the other boundary .",
    "the region from @xmath81 to @xmath86 defines the mc flux rope .    since the ratio of the mc radius to the sun distance is small ( typically @xmath87 or lower ) , @xmath88 .",
    "below we derive a correction to this estimation . if the mc axis does not change drastically its shape , and if it does not disconnect from the sun during the crossing time , its length is evolving proportionally to its distance to the sun , @xmath89 , so @xmath90 ( where @xmath91  au for the present observations ) .",
    "moreover , the cloud global velocity , which is the velocity of its center @xmath92 , is not expected to change significantly during the crossing time ; then , we have : @xmath93 all terms in the right hand side of equation  ( [ byaccumul ] ) can be derived from observations .",

    "dot at cc indicates the location of the cloud center .",
    "numbers 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 are reference points of the observed field lines . ]    there is a clearly distinguishable sub - structure in the cloud center seen as reversed peaks in @xmath41 and as a valley in @xmath94 ( figure  [ fig_fy ] ) .",
    "it has a small extension , @xmath106  au , and is globally anti - symmetric . a less evident sub - structure was also present in the previously analyzed mc ( 18 oct . 1995 , ) .",
    "if @xmath44 , the central sub - structure would imply the presence of a small twisted flux tube with opposite magnetic helicity in the center of the flux rope .",
    "the formation of such a structure is not possible in the corona . after analyzing several possibilities , the simplest interpretation is the following .",
    "close to the minimum approach , the spacecraft trajectory is nearly tangent to the magnetic flux surfaces of the flux rope ( @xmath107 ) .",
    "any warping of the flux surfaces gives a clear signal in the @xmath41 component .",
    "for geometrical reasons , such warping is more difficult to detect outside the center ( where @xmath41 is important ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that such structure will be evident only if the magnetic data are rotated to the correct mc frame to have no mixing with the strong @xmath50 component .",
    "for the 18 oct .",
    "mc , the warping was moderate and @xmath41 kept its sign inside both the in- and the out - bound regions .",
    "for the nov .",
    "9 - 10 mc , the warping is more marked as sketched in figure  [ fig_center ] .",
    "this figure shows ( to the right ) a scheme of the spacecraft trajectory ( vertical dashed line ) across the mc core field lines ( solid warped lines ) .",
    "the core crossing starts at field line 1 and ends at 5. the large dot called cc marks the cloud center position .",
    "it is located towards positive values of @xmath69 since the cloud axis is above the ecliptic plane ( see last paragraph of section  [ mcframe_data ] ) .",
    "considering the cloud as a flux rope , which is compatible with the observations , the same accumulated flux @xmath108 implies that the in- and out - bound field lines are connected ( i.e. , they are in fact the same field line observed twice ) .",
    "thus , for example 1 is connected to 5. the flux @xmath108 has a local maximum at 2 and 4 and a local minimum at 3 when the spacecraft trajectory is tangent to the field lines .      the total azimuthal flux @xmath109 is estimated taking @xmath110 , assuming that @xmath44 .",
    "the largest source of uncertainty is the length of the flux rope , @xmath111 , and in a more general way the assumed invariance by translation .",
    "since this cloud presents signatures of being detached at one of its legs @xcite , we assume an initial length @xmath112  au , so intermediate between values used in previous papers .",
    "the uncertainty in the mc boundary of the out - bound branch has a lower effect since the difference of @xmath109 found with the boundary `` out@xmath98 '' and `` out@xmath97 '' is only about 10% ( see table  [ tab_flux ] ) .",
    "the axial flux @xmath113 , across a surface perpendicular to the cloud axis , can be estimated directly from the observations assuming a circular mc cross section , @xmath44 and neglecting the expansion to compute @xmath114 . here , we neglect the axial flux in the core since it is a correction of the order of @xmath115 , see .",
    "then , for the out - bound branch we compute @xmath116 as ( idem for @xmath117 , but with the integration between @xmath118 and @xmath119 ) : @xmath120 as in previously studied mcs ( e.g. @xcite @xcite , @xcite ; ) @xmath113 is one order of magnitude lower than @xmath109 ( see table  [ tab_flux ] ) .",
    "the analysis of @xmath94 in section  [ direct_method_structure ] indicates that this mc is not formed only by a flux rope .",
    "some of the mc characteristics ( see figure  [ fig_bv_gse ] ) , such as a very unusually high magnetic field with a low variance , a low @xmath14 , and a strong expansion , continue well after the rear boundary of the flux rope ( `` out@xmath15 '' , `` out@xmath17 '' , and `` out@xmath16 '' ) .",
    "we discuss below the most plausible physical scenario to create such magnetic structure .",
    "there is an extended region where @xmath41 has still a negative and coherent behavior from position `` out@xmath16 '' to `` back '' , so the accumulated flux keeps increasing monotonously ( figure  [ fig_fy ] ) .",
    "this behavior was also found in the 18  oct .",
    "1995 mc and it was interpreted as the trace of an original larger magnetic flux rope whose front was partially reconnected with the overtaken magnetic flux , as shown in figure  6 of . in the example analyzed here , this interpretation has even more support from the data , since part of the overtaken flux is still present in front of the mc and we can estimate when reconnection started .",
    "there is a coherent negative @xmath41 field just in front of the mc ( from @xmath8  18:00  ut to 20:30  ut , figure  [ fig_bv_cloud ] ) .",
    "we interpret this as the remnant of the magnetic flux which reconnected with the original flux rope . at the time of observations , the mc overtakes this structure with a velocity difference of @xmath121  km / s ; so reconnection is driven .",
    "such velocity difference is crucial for reconnection efficiency since its rate increases with a larger velocity difference @xcite .",
    "furthermore , and have found that magnetic holes , such as the one preceding the mc analyzed here ( top panel of figure  [ fig_bv_gse ] ) , are associated with magnetic reconnection .    taking into account the previous reconnection scenario , the back region , where @xmath122 has still a coherent negative value , is simply the magnetic flux at the periphery of the original flux rope .",
    "this back region keeps the properties of typical mcs without fitting in the standard flux rope models .",
    "if the front reconnected , this back region is connected to the solar wind field ; so , the magnetic field direction can change because of the propagation of alfven waves , as observed here with the reversal of @xmath123 ( figure  [ fig_bv_cloud ] ) . however ,",
    "if there is no other reconnection process , the flux of @xmath41 can not be removed from the back of the mc ; in fact , we find no other field to allow such reconnection .",
    "thus , the closed ( flux balanced ) flux rope observed at 1 au is embedded in a larger structure which includes an extended back region .",
    "this flux rope was part of a larger one that was partially pealed at its front because it reconnected with its environment .      the high velocity of the mc ( @xmath124  800  km / s ) , compared to its surroundings ( @xmath8  600  km / s ) implies a progressive extension of the back region ( between boundaries `` out@xmath16 '' and `` back '' in figure  [ fig_bv_cloud ] ) . assuming that the relative velocity , @xmath125 , was similar at earlier times and that the @xmath41 component ( in the back region ) had initially a value similar to that in the rear of the mc ( because of pressure balance )",
    ", we can estimate the period of time @xmath126 between the start of reconnection and the mc observations .",
    "the range of time between the observation of the two extremes of the expanding region ( between `` out@xmath16 '' and `` back '' ) is @xmath127  18  h. this corresponds to a spatial extension of @xmath128 when the region was observed .",
    "so , the back region expands in size by @xmath129 since the start of reconnection at the mc front .",
    "this extension has its origin in the relative velocity between the mc and the back region ( which becomes lower because of its magnetic connection to the solar wind ) . from the beginning of the reconnection at the mc front ,",
    "starting a lapse of time @xmath126 earlier than the observations , the `` back '' boundary progressively separates from the mc with a relative velocity @xmath130 . assuming that this relative velocity was not changing drastically during the mc transit , the back region expanded by @xmath131 . equating the previous estimations of the back region extension , we find : @xmath132    the solar event that is the most probable source for the mc studied here occurred in ar 10696 .",
    "it is a multiple event that starts with a steep rise in goes light curve at @xmath73 15:50 ut on nov . 7 , and has two clear peaks , one at @xmath73 16:00 ut and the other at @xmath73 16:35 ut .",
    "at the time of the second peak a large two - ribbon flare was observed within ar 10696 , but also two h@xmath133 ribbons were seen at both sides of an erupting trans - equatorial filament extending from ar 10696 to ar 10695 at the southwest ( see ) . during this intense event that reached class x2.0 in soft x - rays the full neutral line , which formed a switch - back , erupted .",
    "the cme observed in the large angle and spectroscopic coronagraph ( soho / lasco ) c2 on the nov . 7 at 16:54 ut",
    "is associated with this multiple flare involving ar 10696 and the erupting trans - equatorial filament to the southwest .",
    "have proposed that the source of the mc is the ar eruption , while have considered both possibilities either the ar or the trans - equatorial filament eruption .",
    "we discuss below these scenarios in view of our ip analysis .",
    "taking @xmath73  15:50  ut on nov .",
    "7 , as the start time of the solar event , and an arrival time for the mc front at @xmath73 20:30  ut on nov .  9",
    ", we obtain a transit time of @xmath73  52  h , comparable to the transit time ( @xmath73  47  h ) computed assuming a constant mc velocity of -800  km / s and the spacecraft located at l1 .",
    "both estimations are comparable to @xmath126 ( equation [ t - reconnection ] ) ; this implies that reconnection started when the flux rope was close to the sun .    what could be the magnetic structure present in front of the flux rope , probably already from its origin in the corona ?",
    "the field in front of the mc is oriented mostly southward with an average field intensity of @xmath73 -30 nt , though there is a structure of northward oriented field with a temporal length between 19:54 ut and 20:01 ut on nov .",
    "9 , an average field strength of @xmath73 -15 nt , and a spatial extension of @xmath73 0.002 au ( taking an average velocity of @xmath73 -800 km / s ) . analyzing the mdi magnetogram on nov .  7 , the most probable origin of the southward oriented structure is the large scale , nearly potential field of ar 10696 .",
    "if the source of the mc is the ar eruption ; then , the core of the ar should become kink unstable ( as it was observed in an eruption which occurred in the same ar three days later @xcite ) . in the kink instability ,",
    "part of the twist is transformed into writhe implying a strong rotation of the flux rope .",
    "taking into account the mc orientation found in section  [ direct_method_orientation ] , this rotation should be @xmath73 160@xmath33 .",
    "the mhd simulation of gives a writhing of the flux tube of @xmath73 120@xmath33 ( before it reconnects with the overlying field ) .",
    "numerical simulations by confirm this using a different approach and , indeed , the writhing could be as large as a rotation of 160@xmath33 depending on the properties of the overlying field ( trk , private communication ) .",
    "so the amount of rotation and its direction ( for a left - handed flux rope ) , if the mc flux rope comes from the ar , is coherent with recent mhd simulations of kink unstable flux ropes .",
    "interplanetary scintillation observations suggest that the material from the core of the ar was ejected primarily northward and , thus , it could remain unobserved at 1 au ( see ) . in this scenario , and if the source of the mc is the trans - equatorial filament eruption , the direction of the trans - equatorial filament and the cloud axis differ by 67@xmath134 ( see figure 12 in ) .",
    "moreover , the sense of rotation from the filament to the cloud axis is opposite to the one expected from the development of a kink instability in a region of left - handed magnetic helicity . as discussed by",
    ", it may happen that the kink instability has not played a role far away from the strong fields of the ar .",
    "the northward oriented structure observed between 19:54 ut and 20:01 ut on nov .",
    "9 could be related to the northward oriented trans - equatorial loops observed above the filament . however , in both scenarios reconnection should be forced between the ejected flux rope and the above ar arcade field from the beginning of the eruption .",
    "this explains the origin of a nearly antiparallel field ( neglecting the short period of northward directed field ) in front of the flux rope from the beginning of the launch , as indicated by a value of @xmath126 similar to the transit time .",
    "our previous discussion has implications for the reconnection rate in a collisionless plasma .",
    "while the erupting flux rope pushed against an overlying nearly anti - parallel magnetic field , we still observe part of this overlying flux in front of the mc at 1  au !",
    "of course we have no way to determine how strong was the forcing , nor the time dependence of the reconnection rate during the flux rope transit .",
    "still this observation is a clue that magnetic reconnection is not efficient in a collisionless plasma , as expected from classical theory .",
    "some recent observations show direct evidence of magnetic reconnection in a collisionless plasma as the solar wind @xcite .",
    "some numerical simulations show that the hall effect can increase the reconnection rate above the classical rate ( e.g. , ) .",
    "our observations set a constrain on the reconnection rate , which can be quantified only after a numerical modeling of the flux rope ejection and transit to 1  au .    from the computed accumulated flux ( figure  [ fig_fy ] )",
    "we can estimate the relative amount of reconnected flux from the original flux rope ejected from the sun as @xmath135% , assuming @xmath101 ( left panel ) . with the expansion length given by equation  ( [ length_evol ] ) , the flux present in the back part , which is the fraction of reconnected flux ,",
    "is @xmath136% ( however it is not obvious that we can use equation  ( [ length_evol ] ) for the back part where the field is connected to the solar wind ) .",
    "the relative amount of flux present in front of the mc is @xmath137% .",
    "this implies that the relative amount of stable ( not kinked ) magnetic flux , arch - like , above the erupting flux rope is in the interval @xmath138$]% of the azimuthal flux in the mc .    finally , a fraction of the @xmath41 magnetic flux observed after the boundary `` in '' is expected to be reconnected when the spacecraft exits the flux rope .",
    "to estimate an order of magnitude for this flux , let us suppose that the reconnection rate was comparable to its mean value during the transit from the sun .",
    "the amount of reconnected flux during the mc observing time is the ratio of the crossing time ( @xmath139  h ) over the transit time from the sun ( @xmath140  h ) times the flux reconnected from the sun .",
    "then , @xmath73 5% of the original flux was reconnected during the mc crossing time .",
    "so , the fraction of flux reconnected between @xmath141 and @xmath142 is expected to be an amount much lower than the uncertainties in the flux estimations ( see table  [ tab_flux ] ) .",
    "this cloud presents a large velocity difference between its front and rear parts ( fourth panel in figure  [ fig_bv_gse ] ) .",
    "this velocity difference is the consequence of a large mc size and a significant expansion .",
    "both conditions imply that the magnetic field is observed at significantly different times during the mc crossing , so at times when the mc has significant different sizes . as a consequence of magnetic flux conservation , this implies the observed decay of @xmath143 with time ( upper panel of figure  [ fig_bv_gse ] ) .",
    "then , @xmath144 , and even more @xmath57 ( since it is stronger close to the flux rope borders ) presents a remarkable asymmetry between the in- and out - bound branches .",
    "moreover , the center of the cloud is observed before the central observing time for the full structure , as expected for an spatially symmetric expanding object .    in this section",
    "we compare the observations to fitted models describing the evolution of the magnetic field assuming an isotropic self - similar expansion .",
    "the observed velocity is used to derive the expansion rate , which is then used in the expansion magnetic model .",
    "we also quantify the magnetic fluxes from the fitted models , and compare them with the results obtained from a classical static model and the direct method .",
    "we assume an isotropic self - similar expansion of the mc , where all distances are multiplied by a factor @xmath145 : @xmath146 where @xmath147 and @xmath148 is the position of a given element of fluid at some reference time @xmath149 .",
    "since the mc front boundary , called `` in '' , is well defined , we select this as the reference time , @xmath150 .",
    "each element of fluid is labeled by its @xmath148 value , then the @xmath148 coordinate is a marker of each element of fluid ( lagrangian coordinates ) .",
    "we assume below that the flux rope size increases linearly with time .",
    "then , @xmath145 can be written as : @xmath151 where @xmath152 is the time of expansion .",
    "if equation  ( [ f_linear ] ) would be valid for all the transit time from the sun , then the flux rope size would vanish at time @xmath153 , so @xmath152 would also be approximately the transit time from the sun to the position observed at @xmath80 . in practice ,",
    "we use equation  ( [ f_linear ] ) only during the mc crossing ; so , we are only assuming a local linear increase of the size with time .",
    "depending on the evolution during the transit from the sun , @xmath152 could be different from the transit time .",
    "the time evolution for the plasma velocity @xmath154 in the cloud frame comes from equation  ( [ r_self_similar ] ) doing the temporal derivative and keeping @xmath148 fixed ( so following a plasma element ) : @xmath155 the first equality gives the velocity at a given time @xmath156 , so it is proportional to the distance .",
    "the velocity decays with time , but this decay is only apparent since when one follows a given plasma element , defined by @xmath148 , the velocity is in fact constant ( second equality ) .",
    "then , equation  ( [ f_linear ] ) implies that there are no forces acting on any plasma element ( free expansion ) .",
    "this is an `` a posteriori '' justification of equation  ( [ r_self_similar ] ) ; for an isotropic expansion , an initial force - free field stays force - free .",
    "the observed speed is the sum of the expansion speed and of the global speed of the mc . during the time of observation",
    ", we can assume that the mc is globally moving at a constant speed @xmath157 ( velocity of the mc center ) along @xmath56 because the aerodynamic drag significantly affects @xmath158 only in a time scale comparable or larger than the transit time to 1  au .",
    "we also assume that the spacecraft is at rest .",
    "then , the velocity component along @xmath56 is : @xmath159 this equation is fitted to the data to derive @xmath158 , @xmath160 ( the time when the spacecraft crosses the cloud center ) , and @xmath152 .",
    "it is noteworthy that the nearly linear observed @xmath161 is a consequence of the constant speed @xmath158 , and not of the linear expansion with time assumed in equation  ( [ f_linear ] ) .",
    "the assumed expansion introduces only a non linear correction in @xmath162 because the crossing time , @xmath163 , of the mc is small compared to the time of expansion , @xmath152 ( a further correction would come from the non - linear development of a general @xmath145 ) .",
    "this justifies the use of equation ( [ f_linear ] )    ) .",

    "to better show its variation , we subtract the mean value of the velocity computed inside the range of positions `` in '' to `` out@xmath16 '' , @xmath165  km / s .",
    "when the impact parameter ( @xmath166 ) is small , as it is in this mc , this speed represents the radial velocity with respect to the cloud axis , such that for a cloud in expansion , @xmath167 is negative before the spacecraft reaches the cloud axis and positive after that .    from a least square fitting of equation  ( [ v_x ] ) to the velocity data inside the `` in '' to `` out@xmath16 '' boundaries , we obtain @xmath168  h ( @xmath169  days ) .",
    "we find a slightly longer time of expansion @xmath170  h ( @xmath171 days ) when the fit is restricted to the interval between the `` in '' and `` out@xmath15 '' boundaries , and we get @xmath172  h ( @xmath173 days ) for boundaries `` in '' to `` out@xmath17 '' . considering the self - similar expansion given by equation  ( [ f_linear ] ) , this implies that the mc has expanded from the time @xmath80 by a factor @xmath174 and @xmath175 when the spacecraft crossed `` out@xmath16 '' and `` out@xmath15 '' , respectively .",

    "this central reversal can not be taken into account by the model ( see section  [ direct_method_structure ] for an analysis of this feature ) .",
    "close to the boundaries , the asymmetry of the model is not as large as the observed one ; the isotropic expansion model gives @xmath216 , while the observations give @xmath217 .",
    "due to the crossing geometry , the data mainly reflect the radial expansion velocity .",
    "let us now consider a refinement of the above model , the radial expansion is still given by @xmath145 , while the axial expansion is rather given by @xmath218 ( equation  ( [ length_evol ] ) ) .",
    "@xmath57 is affected both by the radial and the axial expansion .",
    "the conservation of the azimuthal flux gives : @xmath219 $ ] . in the fitting of the models ,",
    "we have assumed @xmath220 , but in fact @xmath221 so that @xmath222 is slightly larger than @xmath223 . with @xmath224  h and @xmath225  h , we find @xmath226 and @xmath227 , which gives @xmath228 ( rather than @xmath229 with an isotropic expansion ) , a value closer to the observed value ( @xmath217 ) but still larger .",
    "a spatial asymmetry between the in- and out - bound branches , which can not be attributed to the expansion , is present in the observations ( figure  [ fig_b_fitting ] ) .",
    "indeed , the observed @xmath57 does not have the expected decrease towards the front boundary ( which is present in the model and also in the observations towards `` out@xmath15 '' , figure  [ fig_b_fitting ] ) . at the mc front the magnetic field",
    "is expected to be compressed ( then , it is enhanced ) by the dynamic pressure of the overtaken plasma .",

    "( @xmath113 is not affected by including axial expansion ) .",
    "the fluxes are not corrected for the flux lost by magnetic reconnection during the mc travel from the sun ( since only the direct method permits an estimation of the reconnected flux ) .",
    "the three models are described by the same equations but differ by the constraint set on the free parameters , so the physics involved ( equations  [ b_r]-[b_z ] ) .",
    "an initial length for the cloud @xmath112  au is assumed .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ , > , > , > , > \" , ]     from the fitted parameters and expressions given in equations  ( [ fz_ra])-  ( [ fphi_ra ] ) , we obtain the values for the magnetic fluxes using the different models ( table  [ tab_flux ] ) .",
    "we assume an initial length @xmath112  au as in section  [ direct_method_flux ] . from table",
    "[ tab_flux ] , @xmath113 is estimated in the range [ 2.1 - 7.7]@xmath231  mx , and @xmath109 in the range [ 60 - 102 ] @xmath231  mx . fixing the end boundary at nov 10 , 10:00 ut ( only 20 minutes earlier than boundary `` out@xmath16 '' ) , and using the static classical lundquist s model , reported @xmath232  mx and @xmath233  mx / au ( thus @xmath234  mx , for a cloud length of @xmath235  au , as assumed here ) .",
    "these values , as expected , are very close to our present results with the static model and boundary `` out@xmath16 '' .",
    "our present results show that the expansion affects slightly the computed fluxes ( more @xmath109 ) , while decoupling the fits of @xmath41 and @xmath123 has the largest effect . for rear boundaries `` out@xmath15 '' and `` out@xmath17 '' , the estimations of both fluxes using the modified lundquist s model are in close agreement with the results of the direct method that consider an axial expansion , in particular this agreement is much better for @xmath109 . considering the rear boundary `` out@xmath16 '' ,",
    "the value of @xmath236 obtained from the direct method is lower than the one from the modified lundquist s model due to the significantly negative value of @xmath144 beyond `` out@xmath17 '' ( see figure  [ fig_bv_cloud ] ) ; this contributes to decrease @xmath236 when integrating the circular cloud section between `` out@xmath17 '' to `` out@xmath16 '' .",
    "as discussed in section  [ direct_method_orientation ] , we believe that the rear boundary of the cloud should be between `` out@xmath15 '' and `` out@xmath17 '' .",
    "the icme of nov 9 - 10 , 2004 , was a complex event with a large expansion and a strong magnetic field in the front decreasing monotonously ( almost linearly ) with time .",
    "earlier analysis considered that two magnetic clouds ( mcs ) were located inside this icme .",
    "latter studies concluded that only one mc was present .",
    "we confirm this and precise the orientation and boundaries of the flux rope using several methods .",
    "we also find clues about the interaction of this mc with its surroundings .    to facilitate the understanding of the physics involved in the mc it is useful to transform the data to the local mc frame where the axial and azimuthal components of the magnetic field are decoupled . a classical method to determine the mc axis is the minimum variance ( mv ) method , which takes into account the different spatial behavior of the magnetic field components to find the flux rope orientation .",
    "we minimize the effect of the strong expansion , which implies a decreasing field magnitude with time , normalizing the field at each data point .",
    "this gives a range of possible orientations ( typically with a precision of the order of @xmath237 ) .",
    "the determination of the orientation of the flux rope axis is improved using the direct method .",
    "this method is based on two main points : first , the flux rope is topologically distinct from the surroundings , so it should generically be bounded by a discontinuity of the magnetic field components ( presence of a current sheet ) , and second , the same amount of azimuthal magnetic flux should be present in the in- and out - bound branches of the cloud . for the cloud of nov .",
    "9 - 10 , 2004 , the frontal discontinuity is well defined , while three rear discontinuities are present , called `` out@xmath15 '' , `` out@xmath17 '' , and `` out@xmath16 '' .",
    "they are separated by about 2  h compared to a mc duration of about 14  h. the azimuthal flux relates the frontal discontinuity to two discontinuities at the rear using two different hypotheses for the axial evolution : an expansion comparable to the radial one gives a rear discontinuity at `` out@xmath17 '' , and a negligible axial expansion gives a rear discontinuity at `` out@xmath16 '' . however , since the second case implies a reversal of the axial field at the rear of the mc , we conclude that the first discontinuity ( `` out@xmath17 '' ) is associated to the frontal discontinuity .",
    "this defines precisely the extension , as well as the orientation angle @xmath238 ( within @xmath239 , @xmath240 ) of the flux rope .",
    "fitting a model to the data is another approach to understand the observed magnetic structure .",
    "we have used three models that are based on the lundquist s solution .",
    "the first one is the classical static solution .",
    "the second one includes a self - similar expansion with the same rate in the axial and radial directions .",
    "finally , the third one also includes an isotropic expansion and decouples the fit of the azimuthal and axial field components to take into account the observed stronger azimuthal component ( a possible signature of a flat cross section ) .",
    "the expansion rate is obtained fitting the model to the observed plasma velocity .",
    "the best fits to the data are obtained when the first and second discontinuities ( labeled `` out@xmath15 '' and `` out@xmath17 '' ) are used , in agreement with the results obtained with the direct method .    comparing the results of the fitted models with the direct method , using boundaries `` out@xmath15 '' and `` out@xmath17 '' , we find that the axial and azimuthal fluxes are in the ranges [ 4.7 - 7.7]@xmath231  mx and [ 60 - 95]@xmath231  mx , respectively .",
    "the main limitation on the axial flux measurements is the unknown shape of the cross section . for the azimuthal flux , it is important to consider the axial expansion . here",
    "the limitations are different , the shape of the cross section is not important , the main limitation is the distribution of the flux along the mc axis . finally , we confirm that the azimuthal flux is one order of magnitude larger than the axial flux .    after the large and coherent rotation of @xmath12 , some typical mc characteristics are still present : low level of fluctuations , strong expansion ( observed in the decay of @xmath13 and @xmath143 ) , intensity of magnetic field higher than the typical solar wind values , low @xmath14 .",
    "these are evidences that the mc extends farther in the back of the flux rope .",
    "part of this back ( from `` out@xmath16 '' to `` back '' in figures  [ fig_bv_gse ] and  [ fig_bv_cloud ] ) shows a coherent behavior of @xmath57 , which we interpret as the signature of an originally larger flux rope that was partially reconnected in its front near the sun , with the consequent flux removal .",
    "reconnection of the cloud field with the overtaken solar wind field is another source of underestimation of the original magnetic flux that was launched from the sun .",
    "we have found that @xmath241  % ( with a @xmath242  % as an upper bound ) of the azimuthal flux was lost in the front of the mc during its travel from the sun ; this is much less than in the oct .",
    "18 - 30 , 1995 mc , where it was estimated to be about 57  % @xcite . another difference between the mcs is that the nov . 9 - 10 mc has a back part moving at a speed significantly lower ( by @xmath243  km / s ) than the flux rope ( while the oct .",
    "18 - 20 mc was overtaken by a fast stream ) .",
    "then , the reconnected field progressively forms an extended region in the back of the flux rope ( with a weaker magnitude but still with a smooth spatial variation ) . from the extension and velocity difference of this region with the flux rope",
    ", we have estimated that reconnection started close to the sun , possibly between the erupting twisted flux tube ( giving the flux rope ) and the overlying arcade of active region 10696 .",
    "part of the arcade field is probably present in front of the mc , with a nearly anti - parallel direction and a significant velocity difference ( @xmath244  km / s ) , indicating that magnetic reconnection is not so efficient in the interplanetary space .",
    "reconnection in front of the mc has several observational consequences , as follows : + first , it introduces an asymmetry in the observed magnetic field .",
    "the remaining part of the flux rope is observed first followed by an extended tail of weaker magnetic field ( which is re - orientated since it has changed its connectivity ) . when this process is dominantly at work , this implies the presence of a closed flux rope at the beginning of the icme .",
    "+ second , depending on the solar launch direction , the spacecraft could cross the flux rope or its laterally extended back part . in this last case",
    ", one would detect some characteristics of the mc ( such as a coherent field and low @xmath245 values ) , but without the coherent rotation of the field .",
    "such crossing would be classified as an icme ( without mc ) .",
    "an example of such observations with the two helios spacecrafts is analyzed by and another example using the ace spacecraft is analyzed by .",
    "+ finally , the back flux connected to the solar wind field makes the moving magnetic structure larger in the transverse direction ( orthogonal to the global motion ) . from its mixed origin the back region",
    "is expected to move at a speed intermediate between the mc and the solar wind speed , as observed in the present analyzed mc .",
    "then , with a significant larger velocity than the surrounding medium , the back region is expected to have an effect on the frontal shock surrounding the icme .",
    "a larger transverse scale implies a forward shock at a larger distance in front of the mc than the distance deduced by its flux rope transverse size @xcite .",
    "such large distance has so far being interpreted as a flat flux rope @xcite .",
    "the consequence of reconnection in the front of the mc is an alternative and/or complementary explanation which requires numerical simulations to be quantified .",
    "the results obtained show the potentiality of combining several methods of analysis , minimum variance , direct method and fit to the data .",
    "this analysis will be done for other mcs to derive the variety of possible physical scenarios and also to improve our understanding of mcs and icmes .",
