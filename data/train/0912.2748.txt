    "ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) are characterized by a spectral energy distribution dominated by infrared emission , and an absolute infrared luminosity with l@xmath5 @xmath6 10@xmath3l@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "this means that in ulirgs , ( 1 ) very luminous energy sources with l @xmath6 10@xmath3l@xmath4 are present , ( 2 ) the energy sources are hidden by dust , which absorbs most of the primary radiation , and ( 3 ) the heated dust grains then radiate this energy as infrared dust emission .",
    "the dust - obscured energy sources are nuclear fusion occurring inside rapidly formed stars ( starbursts ) and/or the release of gravitational energy generated by spatially compact , mass - accreting , supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) ( i.e. , agn activity ) . because the ulirg population becomes very important at @xmath7 1 , in terms of cosmic infrared radiation density @xcite , understanding the hidden energy sources of ulirgs",
    "is closely coupled with clarifying the connection between star formation and smbh growth in the dust - obscured galaxy population of the early universe . because distant ulirgs are generally faint",
    ", detailed studies of nearby ( @xmath1 0.3 ) ulirgs continue to play an important role in understanding the nature of the ulirg population of the universe .",
    "nearby ulirgs have two important observational properties .",
    "first , the fraction of optical seyferts ( optically identified agns ) is known to be substantially greater in ulirgs , compared with galaxies with lower infrared luminosities ( l@xmath5 @xmath8 10@xmath3l@xmath4 ) @xcite .",
    "second , although galaxies with l@xmath5 @xmath8 10@xmath3l@xmath4 generally exhibit strong , spatially extended infrared emission originating from stars distributed inside them , the infrared dust emission of nearby ulirgs is dominated by a spatially compact feature @xcite , suggesting that a large amount of dust is concentrated in the nuclear regions of ulirgs , and heated by spatially compact energy sources .    because the nuclear dust concentration increases in ulirgs @xcite , the putative agns in ulirg s cores are surrounded by a large amount of gas and dust , and ionizing uv radiation from the agn can be blocked at the inner part ( @xmath810 pc ) in virtually all lines - of - sight @xcite .",
    "such _ buried",
    "_ agns lack well - developed narrow - line - regions ( nlrs ) at 101000 pc scale , the primary sources of forbidden emission lines , and so are elusive through the conventional optical and infrared spectroscopic classification , looking for high - excitation forbidden emission lines from the nlrs @xcite .",
    "low - resolution infrared 2.535 @xmath0 m spectroscopy is an effective tool for studying such elusive @xcite buried agns , for the following reasons .",
    "first , the effects of dust extinction are sufficiently small ( @xmath80.06a@xmath9 nishiyama et al . 2008 ; 2009 ) that buried agns are detectable .",
    "second , in a normal starburst with moderate metallicity ( @xmath60.3 solar ) , consisting of uv - emitting hii regions , molecular gas and dust , and photo - dissociation regions ( pdrs ) , the pahs in the pdrs are excited by far - uv photons from stars without being destroyed , so strong pah emission is usually detected @xcite . however , pahs in close proximity to an agn are destroyed by the high - energy x - ray radiation of the agn @xcite , so that pah emission is virtually absent from a pure agn , as demonstrated from observations @xcite . in a galaxy hosting an agn , strong pah emission can be observed , if pahs survive in the regions shielded from the high - energy radiation of the agn , and pah - exciting far - uv photons from local energy sources ( i.e. , stars ) are available there . finally , in a normal starburst , stellar energy sources and gas / dust are spatially well mixed @xcite , so that the absolute optical depths of dust absorption features in the infrared spectra can not exceed certain thresholds , whereas the optical depths can be arbitrarily large in a buried agn , because the energy source ( a compact mass - accreting smbh ) is more centrally concentrated than dust / gas @xcite .",
    "thus , in principle , starbursts and buried agns are distinguishable on the basis of the strengths of pah emission and dust absorption features in the infrared spectra .    from the low - resolution infrared 2.535 @xmath0 m spectra of a large number of nearby ulirgs , obtained with _",
    "iso _ , _ spitzer _ and _ akari _ infrared satellites , the detectable buried agn fraction has indeed been found to increase in ulirgs , compared with galaxies with lower infrared luminosities @xcite .",
    "however , because the sample is not statistically complete , some bias and ambiguity could remain .",
    "observations of a complete sample will clearly lead to a better understanding of the true nature of the nearby ulirg population .    in this paper",
    ", we present the _ spitzer _ irs low - resolution infrared 535 @xmath0 m spectra of previously unobserved , optically non - seyfert ulirgs at @xmath1 0.3 . by combining these data with our previous results @xcite",
    ", we can carry out a systematic investigation of the energetic importance of buried agns in nearby ulirgs , based on the complete sample . throughout this paper , h@xmath10 @xmath11 75 km",
    "s@xmath12 mpc@xmath12 , @xmath13 = 0.3 , and @xmath14 = 0.7 are adopted for the sake of consistency with our previously published papers .",
    "the ulirgs in the _ iras _ 1 jy sample @xcite are our targets .",
    "this sample consists of 118 ulirgs at @xmath1 0.3 , whose _ iras _ 60 @xmath0 m fluxes are larger than 1 jy . of these , 33 are optically classified as seyferts , and 85 as non - seyferts @xcite .",

    "irs 535 @xmath0 m low - resolution spectroscopy of one source ( iras 08474 + 1813 ) was scheduled in cycle 3 , we observed the remaining 16 ulirgs on our own , during spitzer cycle 5 .",

    "for ll2 and ll1 , the slit widths were 10@xmath195 and 10@xmath197 , respectively , corresponding to @xmath22 pixels for both ll2 ( 5@xmath191 pixel@xmath12 ) and ll1 ( 5@xmath191 pixel@xmath12 ) .",
    "the latest pipeline - processed data products available at the time of our analysis were used .",

    "all sources were dominated by spatially compact emission whose size is similar to the psf of sl and ll .",

    "wavelength and flux calibrations were made on the basis of the _ spitzer _ pipeline - processed data .",
    "for the sl1 spectra , the data at @xmath20 @xmath6 14.5 @xmath0 m in the observed frame are invalid ( infrared spectrograph data handbook , version 1.0 ) , and thus they were removed . for the ll1 spectra ,",

    "the discrepancies were generally large in double - nuclei ulirgs with separations of a few to several arcsec ( marked sources in the column 1 of table 2 ) , possibly because the ll2 spectra cover the emission from both nuclei and a diffuse component , while the sl1 spectra only probe the emission from a brighter nucleus .",
    "we adjusted the sl1 ( and sl2 ) flux to match the ll2 flux , to minimize missing pah fluxes .",
    "appropriate spectral binning with 2 , 4 , or 8 pixels was applied to reduce the scattering of data points particularly at sl2 ( 5.27.7 @xmath0 m ) and ll2 ( 14.021.3 @xmath0 m ) for faint ulirgs , and at @xmath20 @xmath2 10 @xmath0 m for ulirgs that show deep 9.7 @xmath0 m silicate dust absorption features .",

    "for the sake of consistency , we use the criteria employed by @xcite and @xcite to study buried agns in optically non - seyfert ulirgs .",
    "we first search for ulirgs with luminous buried agn signatures in infrared 535 @xmath0 m spectra , and then estimate the extinction - corrected intrinsic luminosities of buried agns , based on the observed fluxes at @xmath210 @xmath0 m and dust extinction toward the 10 @xmath0 m continuum emitting regions @xcite .    several other methods of evaluating the energetic importance of buried agns , based on _ spitzer _ irs infrared low - resolution spectra , have been proposed in the literature @xcite . in the methods of @xcite , agn and starburst zero - points",
    "were derived from _ unobscured _ agns and starburst galaxies , respectively .",
    "then , relative buried agn contributions to the _ observed _ fluxes of continuum and line emission at infrared 535 @xmath0 m were derived .",
    "no dust extinction correction was applied to estimate buried agn luminosities . even though dust extinction at 535 @xmath0 m is smaller than that at shorter wavelengths ,",
    "using the _ observed _ fluxes could underestimate the intrinsic buried agn luminosities , because emission from buried agns is more highly flux - attenuated than the surrounding starbursts in individual ulirgs , as well as unobscured agns used to determine the agn zero - points .",
    "@xcite applied dust extinction correction to estimate the intrinsic buried agn luminosities , but their modeling utilized only 58 @xmath0 m spectra .",
    "our methods use a wider - wavelength range ( 535 @xmath0 m ) of _ spitzer _ irs spectra , and dust extinction is also taken into account to estimate the buried agn luminosities .      aside from the strong 9.7 @xmath0 m silicate absorption peak ,",
    "the flux attenuation of the continuum emission at @xmath21 @xmath6 5 @xmath0 m is small ( @xmath80.5 mag ) for dust extinction with a@xmath9 @xmath8 20 mag @xcite .",
    "thus , the observed pah emission luminosities at @xmath21 @xmath6 5 @xmath0 m can be used to roughly estimate the intrinsic luminosities of modestly obscured ( a@xmath9 @xmath8 20 mag ) pah - emitting normal starbursts ( with pdrs and modest metallicity ) , provided that the pah emission and infrared luminosities proportionally correlate in the starbursts @xcite . since the metallicity of ulirgs is estimated to be solar or even higher @xcite , the assumption of pah - emitting starbursts is valid in ulirgs @xcite .",

    "the ratios are @xmath81.7 @xmath29 10@xmath30 , or @xmath850 % of 3.4 @xmath29 10@xmath30 ( see also figure 4 ) .",
    "taken at face value , the modestly obscured starbursts detected in these ulirgs account for 971 % ( mostly @xmath850 % ) of their infrared luminosities .",
    "the same argument can be applied to the observed l@xmath28/l@xmath5 ratios for the ulirgs .",
    "the l@xmath28/l@xmath5 ratios are ( 0.31.8 ) @xmath29 10@xmath30 ( table 3 ) , or 21100 % of 1.4 @xmath29 10@xmath30 for modestly obscured starburst galaxies . on the basis of the l@xmath28/l@xmath5 ratios , there are some ulirgs whose infrared luminosities",
    "can be explained by the detected modestly obscured ( a@xmath9 @xmath8 20 mag ) starbursts .",
    "however , for ulirgs with @xmath80.7 @xmath29 10@xmath30 ( @xmath850 % of 1.4 @xmath29 10@xmath30 ) , additional energy sources would be required .",
    "the 11.3 @xmath0 m pah emission tends to provide higher contributions from modestly obscured starbursts to the infrared luminosities of ulirgs , than the 6.2 @xmath0 m pah emission ( figure 4 ) , possibly because the 11.3 @xmath0 m pah emission originates in larger - sized pahs which may be less susceptible to destruction by the energetic radiation from agns and intense starbursts in ulirgs @xcite .",
    "luminosities that are not accounted for by the detected modestly obscured starbursts might originate from ( 1 ) highly obscured ( a@xmath9 @xmath31 20 mag ) starbursts , in which the pah emission flux is substantially attenuated by dust extinction , and/or ( 2 ) buried agns that produce strong infrared radiation , but virtually no pah emission .",
    "we note that emission from _ extreme _ starbursts , which consist of hii - regions only , without pdrs and molecular gas , can be pah - free , because pah molecules can be destroyed inside the hii - regions themselves @xcite . if starbursts are exceptionally more centrally concentrated than the surrounding molecular gas and dust ( figure 1e of imanishi et al .",
    "2007 ) , such hii - region - only starbusts could happen .",
    "however , in the case of ulirg s cores , such _",
    "extreme _ starbursts require extremely high emission surface brightnesses , and so are unlikely @xcite , if not completely ruled out .",
    "we thus use the term `` buried agn signatures '' , rather than `` buried agn evidence '' throughout this manuscript .",
    "highly - obscured normal starbursts and buried agns are basically distinguishable , based on the equivalent width of the pah emission . a pah equivalent width ( ew@xmath22 )",
    "must always be large in a normal starburst ( with pdrs ) with a mixed dust / source geometry , regardless of the amount of dust extinction , because both the pah and nearby continuum emission are similarly flux - attenuated .",
    "thus , a small ew@xmath22 value suggests a contribution from a pah - free continuum - emitting energy source , namely an agn @xcite .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite , we classify ulirgs with ew@xmath27 @xmath8 180 nm and ew@xmath28 @xmath8 200 nm as sources displaying clear signatures of luminous agns , because a considerable contribution from a pah - free continuum would be required for these sources .",
    "figure 5 is a plot of the distribution of ew@xmath27 and ew@xmath28 values .",
    "table 6 ( columns 23 ) records the detection or non - detection of buried agn signatures in terms of the pah equivalent width threshold .",
    "the ew@xmath27 method provides a much larger buried agn fraction ( 7/17 ; 41% ) than the ew@xmath28 method ( 2/17 ; 12% ) , as seen in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "an explanation for this is that the 11.3 @xmath0 m pah emission feature is inside the strong 9.7 @xmath0 m silicate dust absorption feature .",
    "thus , the buried agn continuum emission at @xmath21 @xmath2 11.3 @xmath0 m is severely attenuated , and has little effect on the equivalent widths of the 11.3 @xmath0 m pah emission from less obscured starburst regions outside the agns @xcite .",
    "based on the low ew@xmath22 method , a buried agn with very weak starbursts is easily detectable .",
    "if strong starburst activity is present , agn detection becomes difficult , but a _ weakly obscured _",
    "agn is still detectable , because dilution of the pah emission by the agn s pah - free continuum can be significant .",
    "however , a _ deeply buried _ agn with strong starbursts is very difficult to detect .",
    "even if the intrinsic luminosity of a buried agn is large , the agn flux will be more highly attenuated by dust extinction than the surrounding starburst emission , keeping the observed ew@xmath22 value quite large .    to determine the presence of a deeply buried agn with strong starbursts , we use the optical depths of the silicate dust absorption features .",
    "specifically , these values can be used to distinguish whether the energy sources are spatially well mixed with dust ( a normal starburst ) , or are more centrally concentrated than the dust ( a buried agn ) ( @xmath321 ) .",
    "@xcite obtained a maximum value of @xmath23 @xmath11 1.7 for a normal starburst with a mixed dust / source geometry . considering the possible uncertainties of the @xmath23 estimate , coming from continuum determination ambiguities and statistical errors of individual data points",
    ", we classify ulirgs with @xmath23 @xmath16 2 as potential locations of luminous , but deeply buried agns with centrally concentrated energy source geometries .",
    "five ulirgs have @xmath23 @xmath16 2 ( tables 4 and 6 ) .    as noted by @xcite , although this large @xmath33 method is sensitive to deeply buried agns , it is obviously insensitive to weakly obscured agns , which are better probed with the low ew@xmath22 method . thus , the low ew@xmath22 and large @xmath33 methods are complementary to each other . at the same time , a normal starburst nucleus with a mixed dust / source geometry and a large amount of _ foreground screen dust in an edge - on host galaxy _ ( figure 1d of imanishi et al .",
    "2007 ) , and an exceptionally centrally - concentrated starburst ( figure 1e of imanishi et al . 2007 ) , are capable of producing large @xmath23 values .",
    "however , it is unlikely that the majority of the ulirgs with @xmath23 @xmath16 2 fit these non - agn cases @xcite .      as explained by @xcite , a buried agn with a centrally concentrated energy source geometry should have a strong dust temperature gradient , because the inner dust ( close to the central energy source ) has a higher temperature than the outer dust , whereas a normal starburst nucleus with a mixed dust / source geometry does not exhibit this behavior .",
    "the presence of a strong dust temperature gradient could be detected by comparing the optical depths of the 9.7 @xmath0 m and 18 @xmath0 m silicate dust absorption features , as long as the contaminations from weakly obscured starbursts to observed infrared fluxes are not severe .",
    "@xmath24/@xmath23 @xmath8 0.3 could be taken as the signature of a strong dust temperature gradient @xcite .",
    "this could provide an additional signature for a buried agn .",
    "although this was the case for 12 sources studied by @xcite and @xcite , no such case was found among the 17 newly observed ulirgs ( table 4 , column 4 ) .",
    "because of the contamination from weakly obscured starburst activity , as well as other possible ambiguities @xcite , not all buried agns actually satisfy @xmath24/@xmath23 @xmath8 0.3 .",
    "the criterion @xmath24/@xmath23 @xmath8 0.3 is a sufficient condition for an additional signature of a buried agn , but it is not a necessary condition",
    ".      table 6 ( column 5 ) summarizes the strengths of the detected buried agn signatures in the _ spitzer _ irs 535 @xmath0 m spectra , based on the ( 1 ) low ew@xmath22 and ( 2 ) large @xmath23 methods .",

    "the detection rate of luminous buried agns in the newly observed optically non - seyfert ulirgs ( 8/17 ; 47% ) is significantly smaller than the rate obtained by imanishi ( 2009 ) ( 14/20 ; 70% )",
    ". this may be partly due to the smaller fraction of ulirgs with l@xmath5 @xmath16 10@xmath17l@xmath4 ( 6/17 ; 35% ) in this sample , compared with @xcite ( 17/20 ; 85% ) .      for ulirgs with very low",
    "pah equivalent widths , the observed fluxes are taken to be mostly the result of agn - heated , pah - free dust continuum emission .",
    "we can estimate the extinction - corrected intrinsic dust emission luminosity at @xmath210 @xmath0 m ( @xmath34f@xmath35 ) , heated by the agn , on the basis of the observed fluxes at @xmath21 @xmath2 10 @xmath0 m and dust extinction toward the 10 @xmath0 m continuum emitting regions inferred from @xmath23 @xcite . as argued by @xcite and @xcite , in a pure agn with a simple spherical dust distribution , dust emission luminosity",
    "is conserved at each temperature from hot inside regions to cool outside regions ( figure 2 of imanishi et al .",
    "the extinction - corrected 10 @xmath0 m luminosity ( @xmath34f@xmath35 ) should be comparable to the intrinsic luminosity of the agn s primary radiation .    to obtain the estimate",
    ", we followed @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the flux attenuation of the 8 or 13 @xmath0 m continuum outside the 9.7 @xmath0 m silicate feature is 10@xmath36 @xcite , and ranges from a factor of 1.3 ( iras 14202 + 2615 ; @xmath23 @xmath2 0.7 ) to 3.3 ( iras 04074@xmath372801 ; @xmath23 @xmath2 3.0 ) .",
    "we found that the extinction - corrected intrinsic buried agn luminosities for selected ulirgs with very low ew@xmath22 values are a few @xmath29 10@xmath38 ergs s@xmath12 , or @xmath210@xmath3l@xmath4 in the maximum case ( table 7 ) .",
    "figure 6 compares the intrinsic buried agn luminosity and the infrared luminosity .",
    "the detected buried agns could explain a significant , but not dominant fraction ( 633% ) , of the luminosities of these ulirgs . in table 7 ,",
    "the luminosities of the detected modestly obscured starbursts , estimated from the l@xmath27 and l@xmath28 values , are also listed for the sake of comparison .",
    "our method to estimate the intrinsic buried agn luminosities is very simple and straightforward , with a small amount of free parameters .",
    "the largest possible uncertainty is dust extinction curve in ulirgs , which might be different from that established in the galactic inter - stellar medium which we adopted .",
    "different dust grain size distribution can produce different dust extinction ratio between widely separate wavelengths , such as optical and 10 @xmath0 m .",
    "however , as mentioned by imanishi et al .",
    "( 2007 ; their appendix ) , our estimate is dependent only on the dust extinction ratio between 8 or 13 @xmath0 m continuum and @xmath23 , which should be insensitive to dust size distribution , because of the proximity of the wavelengths .",
    "hence , our method is robust to this possible uncertainty .",
    "@xcite investigated the presence of luminous buried agns in 48 ulirgs at @xmath1 0.15 , classified optically as non - seyferts ( 28 liner and 20 hii - region ulirgs ) .",
    "@xcite did the same in 20 ulirgs at @xmath7 0.15 , classified optically as non - seyferts ( 10 liner , 6 hii - region , 4 unclassified ulirgs ) . in the present research",
    ", we have continued this work in 13 optically non - seyfert ulirgs at @xmath7 0.15 ( 5 liner , 6 hii - region , 2 unclassified ulirgs ) and four optically unclassified ulirgs at @xmath1 0.15 .",
    "taken together , these 85 observed sources comprise a _",
    "complete _ sample of optically non - seyfert ulirgs in the _ iras _ 1 jy sample .",
    "following @xcite , we divide the observed ulirgs into those with 10@xmath3l@xmath4 @xmath18 l@xmath5 @xmath8 10@xmath17l@xmath4 and those with l@xmath5",
    "@xmath16 10@xmath17l@xmath4 .",
    "after combining the results of @xcite , @xcite and this paper , we summarize the detectable buried agn fraction in table 8 . using this complete sample ,",
    "we confirm the previously discovered trend @xcite that the detectable buried agn fraction is significantly higher in ulirgs with l@xmath5 @xmath16 10@xmath17l@xmath4 ( 22/31 ; 71% ) than in those with 10@xmath3l@xmath4 @xmath18 l@xmath5 @xmath8 10@xmath17l@xmath4 ( 15/54 ; 28% ) .",
    "figure 7 illustrates this trend by including galaxies with l@xmath5 @xmath8 10@xmath3l@xmath4 .",
    "figure 5 displays the distributions of ew@xmath27 , ew@xmath28 and @xmath23 as functions of galaxy infrared luminosity .",
    "it is clear that the fraction of galaxies that meet the requirements for a buried agn increases with increasing galaxy infrared luminosity in all plots .    in table 8",
    ", we also find that buried agns are more important in liner ulirgs ( 21/43 ; 49% ) than in hii - region ulirgs ( 12/32 ; 38% ) , as has been previously suggested @xcite .",
    "however , the difference is now small in this complete sample , and is possibly caused by a higher fraction of ulirgs with l@xmath5 @xmath16 10@xmath17l@xmath4 in the liner sample ( 18/43 ; 42% ) than in the hii - region sample ( 10/32 ; 31% ) ( table 8) .",
    "the buried agn fraction is also higher in ulirgs at @xmath7 0.15 than in those at @xmath39 0.15 , but this may be due to the presence of a larger fraction of more luminous ulirgs in a more distant sample .    for an agn surrounded by dust with a torus - shaped distribution , the visibility of the central agn is expected to increase with increasing agn luminosity , because the innermost dust sublimation radius of the torus is proportional to the square root of the central agn luminosity , and thus ( assuming a constant torus scale height ) the opening angle of the agn is greater in luminous agns ( the so - called receding torus model : lawrence 1991 ; simpson 2005 ; arshakian 2005 ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the fraction of optically elusive buried agns is not large in luminous agns .",
    "however , this model is applicable _ only if _ the total amount of dust surrounding the central agn does not vary significantly , depending on the galaxy and agn luminosity .",
    "ulirgs are driven by mergers of gas - rich galaxies , and gas / dust is quickly transported to the nuclear regions by the gravitational torques , producing a highly - concentrated nuclear gas / dust distribution @xcite .",
    "agns can be easily buried by the increasing amount of nuclear gas / dust surrounding the central agns , and thus we believe that a high buried agn fraction is a natural state of affairs in ulirgs .    the higher fractions of buried agns ( found in this work ) and optical seyferts @xcite indicate that agns become intrinsically more important with increasing galaxy infrared luminosity .",
    "the agn - starburst connections depend on galaxy luminosity_. this is the primary consequence of our results .",
    "figure 6 suggests that agn s energetic contributions are generally 1050% , or @xmath230% in median value , in ulirgs with buried agn signatures , which roughly agrees with other independent estimates @xcite in overall ulirg sample .",
    "if 30% of the infrared luminosity comes from a buried agn in a ulirg with l@xmath5 = 10@xmath17l@xmath4 (= 2 @xmath29 10@xmath3l@xmath4 ) , then the remaining infrared luminosity , originating in starbursts ( including highly obscured a@xmath9 @xmath31 20 mag ones ) , is 1.4 @xmath29 10@xmath3l@xmath4 . in the meanwhile ,",
    "buried agn contribution is generally insignificant in galaxies with l@xmath5 = 10@xmath40l@xmath4 (= 2 @xmath29 10@xmath41l@xmath4 ) ( figure 7 ) , and in this case , the starburst - originating luminosity is @xmath22 @xmath29 10@xmath41l@xmath4 .",
    "namely , in ulirgs , the _ relative _ energetic importance of buried agn is higher , but the _ absolute _ luminosities of starbursts , and thereby the star - formation rates , are also higher than galaxies with lower infrared luminosities .",
    "unless the starburst duration time is drastically different , ulirgs will produce more stars in the future , and evolve into more massive galaxies with larger stellar masses , than less infrared luminous galaxies .",
    "given the mass correlation between smbh and spheroidal stellar component @xcite , galaxies with lower infrared luminosities should also contain smbhs whose masses are proportional to those of spheroidal stars .",
    "the higher agn contributions in ulirgs suggest that smbhs in ulirgs ( progenitors of massive galaxies ) are actively mass - accreting , and consequently , can have stronger radiation feedbacks to the surrounding gas and dust than mildly mass accreting smbhs in less infrared luminous galaxies .",
    "a related phenomenon may be galaxy downsizing , where the more massive galaxies ( with currently larger stellar masses ) completed their major star formation during an earlier cosmic age @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that in these more massive galaxies , agn feedback was stronger in the past , heating or expelling gas and suppressing further star formation over a shorter time scale @xcite .",
    "buried agns surrounded by a large amount of gas and dust may have particularly strong feedback , compared to already visible agns with a relatively thin dust covering , and thus are the important population for determining the interplay between agns and host galaxies .",
    "figure 8 illustrates our findings that _ buried agns are relatively more important energetically in galaxies that are currently more infrared luminous , and in the future , these galaxies will evolve into more massive galaxies with larger stellar masses . _",
    "the energetic contributions from buried agns become discernible in ulirgs , which are thought to evolve into galaxies with stellar masses of several @xmath29 10@xmath42m@xmath4 , based on infrared velocity dispersion measurements of ulirg s host galaxies @xcite .",
    "a similar eventual spheroidal stellar mass is derived for ulirgs with detectable buried agn signatures , from the intrinsic buried agn luminosities @xcite , if we assume that agn luminosities are eddington limits and if the widely accepted mass correlation between smbhs and spheroidal steller components holds @xcite .",
    "this mass with several @xmath29 10@xmath42m@xmath4 roughly corresponds to the stellar mass that separates red , massive galaxies with low current star formation rates ( major star formation has already been completed ) and blue , less massive galaxies with ongoing active star formation in the local universe @xcite .",
    "thus , our results may offer support to the agn feedback scenario as the origin of the galaxy downsizing phenomenon .",
    "we have presented the results of _ spitzer _ irs infrared 535 @xmath0 m low - resolution ( r @xmath2 100 ) spectroscopy of 17 nearby ulirgs at @xmath1 0.2 , optically classified as non - seyferts ( liners , hii - regions , and unclassified , i.e. , no optical agn signatures ) .",
    "optically elusive , but intrinsically luminous buried agns were searched for in these optically non - seyfert ulirgs , on the basis of the strengths of pah emission and silicate dust absorption features .",
    "we then combined these results with those of our previous studies of nearby ulirgs , using _",
    "irs , to investigate the energetic importance of buried agns in a _",
    "complete sample _ of optically non - seyfert ulirgs in the local universe at @xmath1 0.3 ( 85 sources altogether ) .",
    "we arrived at the following primary conclusions .    1 .   among the 17 newly observed optically non - seyfert ulirgs ,",
    "the signatures of important energy contributions from buried agns were found in eight sources . in these sources ,",
    "the extinction - corrected intrinsic buried agn luminosities were estimated at up to @xmath210@xmath3l@xmath4 , accounting for a significant fraction ( 633% ) of the observed infrared luminosities of these ulirgs .",
    "2 .   by combining our new results with those of our previous studies",
    "@xcite , we found that buried agns are energetically important in 37 sources of the complete ulirg sample of 85 ( 37/85 = 44% ) , confirming previous suggestion that optically elusive , luminous buried agns are common in the ulirgs of the local universe .",
    "we investigated the fraction of detectable luminous buried agns by separating ulirgs with 10@xmath3l@xmath4 @xmath18 l@xmath5 @xmath8 10@xmath17l@xmath4 ( 54 sources ) and l@xmath5 @xmath16 10@xmath17l@xmath4 ( 31 sources ) .",
    "we found that luminous buried agns were much more common in the latter ulirgs ( 22/31 = 71% ) than in the former ulirgs ( 15/54 = 28% ) , confirming the previous arguments that buried agns become more energetically important with increasing galaxy infrared luminosity .",
    "4 .   given the higher fraction of optical seyferts ( optically identified agns ) in ulirgs with higher infrared luminosities , luminous agns are more common in ulirgs with l@xmath5 @xmath16 10@xmath17l@xmath4 than in ulirgs with 10@xmath3l@xmath4 @xmath18 l@xmath5 @xmath8 10@xmath17l@xmath4 . because the detection rate of both optically identified seyfert agns and optically elusive buried agns",
    "is substantially lower in galaxies with lower infrared luminosities ( l@xmath5 @xmath8 10@xmath3l@xmath4 ) , we can conclude that the energetic importance of agns increases with increasing galaxy infrared luminosity , suggesting that _ the agn - starburst connections are luminosity dependent_. this may be related to the widely - proposed agn feedback scenario for the galaxy downsizing phenomenon .",

    "<S> the presence of optically elusive , but intrinsically luminous , buried agns is investigated , based on the strengths of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission and silicate dust absorption features detected in the spectra . </S>",
    "<S> the signatures of luminous buried agns , whose intrinsic luminosities range up to @xmath210@xmath3l@xmath4 , are found in eight sources . </S>",
    "<S> we combine these results with those of our previous research to investigate the energy function of buried agns in a complete sample of optically non - seyfert ulirgs in the local universe at @xmath1 0.3 ( 85 sources ) . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm a trend that we previously discovered : that buried agns are more common in galaxies with higher infrared luminosities . because optical seyferts also show a similar trend , we argue more generally that the energetic importance of agns is intrinsically higher in more luminous galaxies , suggesting that the agn - starburst connections are luminosity - dependent . </S>",
    "<S> this may be related to the stronger agn feedback scenario in currently more massive galaxy systems , as a possible origin of the galaxy downsizing phenomenon . </S>"
