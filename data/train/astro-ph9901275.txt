    "the bright , variable , seyfert  1 galaxy ngc  5548 has been extensively studied at many wavelengths . it has been a target of reverberation mapping experiments in the optical and uv ( peterson et al .",
    "1992 , clavel et al .",
    "1991 , korista et al .",
    "these have led to the accurate determination of the physical size of the belr .",
    "the uv spectrum also shows absorption lines [ shull & sachs 1993 , mathur , elvis & wilkes 1995 ( mew95 ) ] and monitoring observations place upper limits on the response time of the uv absorbers to changes in the uv continuum .",
    "the x - ray spectrum shows an ionized absorber ( nandra et al .",
    "1991 , reynolds 1997 , george  1998 ) .",
    "ngc5548 is radio - quiet , like most seyfert galaxies , but it is not radio silent .",
    "large radio lobes are observed in the plane of sky indicative of an edge - on nuclear geometry .",
    "recently , based on asca and hst fos data , mew95 showed that the ionized x - ray and uv absorption in ngc5548 is likely to originate in the same material .",
    "this unification allowed us to combine the x - ray and uv constraints to determine the physical conditions of the absorber . in the fos data , the measured line widths for the civ doublet are @xmath2350 km  s@xmath1 ( fwhm ) , broader that the nominal spectral resolution for this observation ( @xmath2250 km s@xmath1 ) and thus possibly resolved",
    "this would imply that the absorber is dispersed in velocity space .",
    "high resolution observations would allow accurate determination of the velocity spread parameter and resolve multiple components if any .",
    "this in turn would allow better estimates of column density .",
    "we observed the civ line in ngc5548 with ghrs on hst with this aim in mind .",
    "we observed ngc5548 with ghrs on hst on 24 august 1996 . the exposure was centered around the civ emission line .",
    "a total exposure time of 14,035 seconds was obtained using g160 m in accum mode covering the wavelength range 15541590 .",
    "the large science aperture ( @xmath3 ) was used , providing a spectral resolution of @xmath4 .",
    "we also observed with the lower resolution g140l grating for 2176 seconds to measure the complete line profile and part of the continuum on both sides of the line ( 1417-1713 ) .",
    "data reduction was performed using * stsdas * in iraf following procedures described in the hst data handbook . the wavelength shift in different groups of a single exposure , as well as between different exposures , was determined with the task * poffsets * by using the wavelength information in the associated calibration files .",
    "the groups were then aligned and combined using * specalign*. wavelength and flux information was combined using * mkmultispec*. the resulting total g160 m spectrum , smoothed by a boxcar of seven pixels , is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the g160 m spectrum clearly shows multiple components in the absorption line profile . by using the wavelength difference in the civ doublet components",
    ", we find that there may be as many as six different velocity components ( figure 1 ) .",
    "accurate determination of absorption line parameters is our primary goal , and so , to determine a reasonable estimate , we used three different methods to measure the absorption lines .",
    "first , we used * splot * to measure the absorption line equivalent widths ( ews ) by simple linear interpolation across the line in the emission line profile .",
    "this method is unable to measure the blended components 4 and 5 separately .",
    "we next fitted each absorption line profile with a gaussian , again in * splot*. these two sets of measurements served as the initial guesses of the ews . to measure the correct ews",
    ", we have to take into account the emission line profile .",
    "fitting of the emission and absorption lines together was done using the stsdas task * specfit * ( kriss 1994 ) .",
    "first we used the lower resolution g140l spectrum to fit the power - law continuum and the emission line profile .",
    "the emission line was fitted with broad and narrow gaussian profiles over the regions unaffected by absorption .",
    "these fit parameters were used in the subsequent fits to the high resolution spectrum .",
    "the parameters of the power - law continuum , the slope and normalization , were fixed in all the fits to the high resolution data .",
    "the true shape of the emission profile is the major unknown that affects the ews of the absorption lines . to assess the range of probable ews , we fitted the emission lines with three different line profiles , ` high ' , ` medium ' and ` low ' , using slightly different parts of the emission line",
    ". fits over the entire wavelength range were then performed by adding a gaussian for each absorption line .",
    "we performed over ten different fits to obtain estimates of the absorption line parameters .",
    "initially , component 6 was not included in the fit since this part of the spectrum might have been a part of the emission line profile . however , adding this component increased the quality of the fit substantially with a significant reduction in @xmath5 . in table 1 , we report the ews of the absorption lines for the four most acceptable fits . in fit 1 , we fixed the parameters of the emission line to the low profile .",
    "in fit 2 , we fixed these parameters to the medium profile . in fit 3 , we allowed these parameters to vary .",
    "the shape of the emission line profile in this case is close to the high profile ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "the width of both doublet lines in a given component was required to be the same , although different from component to component ; and the @xmath6 was kept constant ( at 2.64  ) . except for these constraints ,",
    "the absorption line parameters ( ew , centroid , fwhm ) were allowed to be free .",
    "inspection of these results ( table 1 ) shows that the doublet ratios for most of the absorption components are not equal to the value of two required by atomic physics for optically thin gas ( except for components 3 & 6 in fit 2 ) .",
    "given the small ew of the lines , saturation is unlikely to be the cause . for lines with low ews , partial covering of the continuum source",
    "might be the cause of doublet ratios close to one .",
    "we discuss this in details below .",
    "we also performed one more fit ( fit 4 ) by fixing the doublet ew ratio to two , and allowing the emission line parameters to be free to vary .",
    "the shape of the emission line profile in this case is even higher than the high profile ( fig .",
    "2 ) , which seems unlikely .",
    "the fit in this case is also significantly worse than for fits 13 .",
    "fit 2 gives the statistically best fit and in table 2 we list the ew , fwhm , centroid wavelength , and the civ column density inferred for each component for this case .",
    "we note , however , that these values are not unique since fit 3 is statistically indistinguishable from fit 2 .",
    "the fit 2 derived parameters of the emission lines , flux , centroid and fwhm , are also listed in table 2 .",
    "the large range in the ews resulting from different fits ( typically a factor 2 - 3 , but even a factor of 10 in some cases ) is clearly seen in table 1 and indicates the uncertainty in these measurements . however , as discussed elsewhere , emission lines profiles in fits 1 and 4 are unlikely to be true .",
    "considering only fits 2 & 3 , the scatter in ews range from a factor of 1 for component 4(1 ) to a factor of 5 in component 6(2 ) .",
    "the civ absorber has six clear , distinct velocity components ( marked as components 1  6 in figure 1 ) .",
    "components 1 , 3 & 6 are broad ( with fwhm@xmath7 km s @xmath1 , table 2 ) while components 2 , 4 , & 5 are narrow . note that the ew of the weak line of component 1 ( 1(2 ) ) is at 1@xmath8 level for all fits , except for fit 4 where it was constrained to be higher .",
    "it is therefore possible that component 1 is spurious .",
    "similarly , ew of component 6(2 ) is barely at 3@xmath8 level for fit 1 .",
    "so we believe that low profile may not be the correct description of the emission line . the doublet ratios of the broad components in fit 2 , the best fit , are close to two , while for the narrow components the ratio is systematically smaller .",
    "we investigated whether partial covering might be playing a role for the narrow components .",
    "following hamann ( 1997 ) we measured the residual intensity at the troughs of the absorption lines and determined the covering fraction c@xmath9 using their equation 5 .",
    "we found c@xmath9 to be 0.39 , 0.99 & 0.73 for components 2 , 4 & 5 respectively .",
    "based on flux errors , we estimate errors on c@xmath9 to be 7.5% , 13.5% and 15% for components 2 , 4 & 5 respectively . thus it is likely that the closely spaced components 4 & 5 have the same covering fraction of @xmath10 , with component 2 having about half that value . ` partial covering ' may be due either to a simple geometrical factor or to ` filling in ' of the absorption lines by scattered continuum as in balqsos ( cohen  1995 ) .",
    "the civ column density in each component was calculated by integrating the optical depths over the absorption line profile ( savage & sembach 1991 ) for ( 1 ) complete coverage ( c@xmath11 ) and ( 2 ) partial coverage ( c@xmath12 ) assuming constant c@xmath9 across the line for narrow lines .",
    "we used equation 6 in hamann ( 1997 ) to calculate optical depths in case of partial covering .",
    "the resulting values of n(civ ) for fit 2 are given in table 2 .",
    "we also calculated n(civ ) using the measured ews and assuming the line to be on the linear part of the curve - of - growth , a very good assumption given the low ews and observed fwhm of the lines .",
    "the values of n(civ ) from this method are similar to those obtained from the optical depth method within 0.1 dex ( see table 2 ) .",
    "the scatter in n(civ ) from all the fits 14 is about 0.2 dex for component 5 and 0.3 dex for components 2 , 3 & 4 .",
    "the errors are larger , about an order of magnitude , for component 6 which is closest to the emission line peak where the emission line profile is most uncertain .",
    "clearly , the uncertainty in column density is governed by the uncertainty in the underlying emission line profile .",
    "the resolution of ghrs is @xmath1320,000 , corresponding to @xmath14 km / s at 1575  .",
    "so all the absorption lines are resolved with fwhm ranging from @xmath15 km s@xmath1 for component 2 to @xmath16 km s@xmath1 for component 1 .",
    "the thermal width of carbon in a 10@xmath17 k gas is about 4  km / s and of a 10@xmath18 k gas is about 12 km / s .",
    "since photoionization models based on x - ray observations imply temperature 10@xmath18 k , this is about the highest temperature allowed for civ absorption systems .",
    "the total column densities would otherwise be even higher .",
    "the implication is that there are nonthermal velocities , possibly due to bulk or turbulent motions , involved with the absorbing flows .    except for components 1 and 6 ,",
    "the absorption lines are deeper than the power - law continuum emission .",
    "the absorbing gas must cover the belr , at least partially , and so must lie outside the belr .",
    "the only other possibility is that the system is absorbing flux from the far side of the belr and so may be co - spatial with it .",
    "the systemic redshift of ngc5548 is uncertain to about hundred km s@xmath1 .",
    "as reported by de vaucouleurs ( 1991 ) , the 21-cm hi velocity is 5149 km s@xmath1 ( z=0.017175 ) while the optical emission line measurements give 5026 km s@xmath1 .",
    "shull & sachs ( 1993 ) used 5133 km s@xmath1 while cz=5220 km s@xmath1 was used in the iue campaign ( clavel  1991 ) .",
    "the observed ghrs redshift of the broad emission line is cz=4950 km s@xmath1 and that of the narrow emission line is 5130 km s@xmath1 ( table 2 ) ,",
    "consistent with the hi measurement .",
    "the broad line is blueshifted by 180 km s@xmath1 with respect to the narrow line .",
    "the narrow lines have fwhm100 km s@xmath1 and could arise in the interstellar medium or halo of the host galaxy .",
    "the broad components , on the other hand , are likely to be located closer in the nucleus .",
    "the broad components also fully cover the civ emission region . a simple geometrical arrangement would be to have the broad absorbing region outside , but attached , to the belr and of similar size .",
    "the redshifts of absorbing components range from cz=3900 km s@xmath1 for component 1 to cz=5400 km s@xmath1 for component 6 ( fit 2 ) .",
    "while broad components 1 & 3 indicate material outflowing from the nucleus with velocities from 1050 & 450 km / s respectively , component 6 must be associated with an inflow with a velocity of 450 km / s with respect to the belr , suggesting an outflow as well as an inflow in the nuclear region of ngc5548 .",
    "however , the broad civ emission line peak and the absorption systems 15 are outflowing with respect to the host galaxy hi velocity .",
    "the component 6 is inflowing with respect to the hi velocity as well .",
    "there is no systematic trend of line properties , fwhm or ew , with redshift offset , possibly due to random motions .",
    "clearly , the kinematics of the nuclear region in ngc5548 is complex . done & krolik ( 1996 ) have studied the kinematics of the broad emission line region in ngc 5548 and based on velocity resolved reverberation mapping found evidence for significant radial infall in addition to random motions .",
    "our observations of absorption line components support their claim , but give strong evidence of outflow as well . the infalling component 6",
    "might be related to the accretion flow onto the central black hole .",
    "as discussed earlier , ngc5548 contains an ionized x - ray absorber .",
    "is the x - ray absorber related to any of the uv absorbers seen in the ghrs spectrum ? based on the model of the x - ray absorber ( see mew95 for details ) ,",
    "the predicted civ column density is 27@xmath19 @xmath20 [ note that this is an order of magnitude smaller than that derived in mew95 because of subsequent significant changes in the photoionization code cloudy ( ferland 1996 ) . for the present calculations we have used the latest version 90.04 of cloudy ] . given the civ column density in the absorption line components ( table 2 ) , the x - ray warm absorber is likely to be associated with one of the broad components , either 3 or 6 .",
    "[ however , this conclusion could change if further updates to cloudy produced factor of 3 change in predicted n(civ ) ] . if component 6 is indeed related to the accretion flow and thus is cold , then the x - ray ionized absorber may likely be related to component 3 .",
    "the definite way to resolve this is with high resolution x - ray spectroscopy . as",
    "yet there is no x - ray spectroscopy anywhere close to ghrs resolution , so direct tests are not possible .",
    "the broad components 3 & 6 are separated by @xmath21 corresponding to @xmath22 ev at the ovii edge of the warm absorber .",
    "high resolution observations with axaf would be able to determine the edge energy accurately enough to tell them apart .",
    "the absence of greater x - ray absorption implies that the remaining civ components must have a much lower ionization state and smaller total column density by at least an order of magnitude .",
    "kinematically complex uv absorption , similar to that reported here , is also present in other seyfert galaxies , e.g. mrk 509 ( crenshaw  1995 ) , ngc4151 ( weymann  1997 ) , ngc3516 ( kriss 1996 , crenshaw 1999 ) .",
    "all of these objects also show presence of a x - ray warm absorber , qualitatively similar to that in ngc5548 ( reynolds 1997 , warwick  1996 , mathur 1997 for mrk509 , ngc4151 and ngc3516 respectively ) . in mrk509 and ngc4151 ,",
    "parameters of the warm absorber are not well constrained due to the complexity in x - ray spectra ; as a result comparison with uv absorption is difficult .",
    "the uv absorption system in ngc3516 also shows narrow as well as broad components .",
    "however , the broad components have disappeared since @xmath23 .",
    "mathur  ( 1997 ) have shown that an evolving x - ray / uv absorber is consistent with the presence of x - ray warm absorber , presence of broad uv absorption in the iue data and their disappearance in the recent uv observations .",
    "our ghrs observations of ngc5548 thus marks the first case in which complex uv absorption is present and for which a meaningful comparison with x - ray absorption can be made .",
    "it should also be noted that the uv absorption in a high resolution ghrs observation of ngc3783 is also found to be consistent with x - ray absorption ( shields and hamann 1997 ) , though the uv absorption in that case is not kinematically complex .",
    "even though our unified x / uv absorption scenario ( mew95 and references therein ) has stood the test of high resolution observations , it may not be adequate to explain complex systems in its present single - zone , photoionization equlibrium form .",
    "multi - zone , multiparameter models will be required when the absorption systems show multiple components ( e.g. objects in hamann 1997 ) . in some highly variable objects ( e.g. ngc4051 ) ,",
    "non - equilibrium models might be necessary ( nicastro 1999 ) .",
    "the x / uv models should evolve and become more refined as better quality data become available ( see mathur 1997 ) . at present",
    ", all the available data ( mathur  1998 ) clearly suggests that the uv and x - ray absorbers are physically related and perhaps identical ; at a minimum the x - ray absorption makes a substantial contribution to the absorption seen in the uv .",
