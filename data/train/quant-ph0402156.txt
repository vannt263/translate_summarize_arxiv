    "quantum computation takes advantages of phenomena belonging to quantum mechanics for encoding , processing and communicating information .",
    "this allows more efficient computations than those based upon classical mechanics .    according to the postulates of quantum mechanics ,",
    "the state of a quantum system is a vector in a hilbert space . if this system is closed , then its evolution is unitary , hence reversible . otherwise , the action which consists in opening the system is a measurement .",
    "these postulates are reflected by the traditional three - step approach to quantum computation : initial preparation of the quantum system state , application of unitary transformations , measurement of a final state .",
    "we briefly introduce notations which are used for describing quantum states , unitary transformations and quantum measurements , referring to the books by nielsen and chuang @xcite , and by kitaev , shen and vyalyi @xcite for more details . here , a quantum system is a register of qubits . the state of a @xmath0-qubit register is a normalized vector in a @xmath1 dimensional hilbert space @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a vector in dirac s notation , is the computational basis of @xmath5 .",
    "thus a @xmath0-qubit state @xmath6 in the computational basis is : @xmath7 , @xmath8 .    a unitary evolution @xmath9 , which acts on @xmath0 qubits , is represented by a @xmath10 unitary matrix @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath9 transforms @xmath6 into @xmath12 . clearly , a unitary evolution is deterministic .",
    "a measurement is represented by an observable @xmath13 which is a hermitian matrix .",
    "considering the spectral decomposition of @xmath13 , @xmath14 , a @xmath13-measurement transforms , with probability @xmath15 , a state @xmath6 into the state @xmath16 , where @xmath15 is the scalar product of @xmath6 and @xmath17 .",
    "the classical outcome of the measurement is @xmath18 .",
    "thus a measurement is a probabilistic transformation of the state of the register , which returns a classical outcome @xmath18 .",
    "the classical outcome gives information on the state of the system after the measurement .",
    "pauli matrices , @xmath19 are unitary matrices which can be viewed as unitary operators ( in this case the notation @xmath20 is prefered to @xmath21 )",
    ". they can also be viewed as observables since they are hermitian .",
    "pauli matrices form a group ( up to a global phase ) , e.g. @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "a @xmath24-measurement is also called a measurement in the computational basis .",
    "@xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28      unitary transformations characterize the evolution of _ closed _ systems . for a unitary transformation",
    "to be _ applied _ to a quantum system , an interaction between this quantum system and an experimentalist belonging to the classical world is necessary .",
    "this implies that the quantum system is opened , in turn implying that its evolution can no longer be described by postulates on the evolution of _ closed _ quantum systems .",
    "even if , from an experimental point of view , it is still reasonable , up to some approximations , to consider that a unitary transformation is nevertheless applied to the quantum system , from a computational point of view , these approximations can not be accepted , for reasons explained next .",
    "the traditional organization of a quantum computation consists in initialising a quantum system in the zero state ( i.e. all qubits are in state @xmath29 ) , then in applying unitary transformations and , at the end of the computation , in measuring the system in the computational basis . in this computational scheme ,",
    "only the stage of unitary transformations depends on the algorithm ( e.g. shor s algorithm ) and on the classical instance of the problem ( e.g. a large number to factorize ) .",
    "if the system is considered as being _ closed _ during this stage of unitary transformations , then the outcome produced by this computation may not depend on the algorithm nor on the problem instance .",
    "information about the algorithm and the classical instance is never _ transmitted _ to the quantum system because this system is closed , so the outcome of the computation has no interest .    to sum up , from a strictly abstract computational point of view",
    ", closed quantum systems can not be controlled , because if one tries to control them , they necessarily become open , hence quantum measurements seem to be the unique tool which can be used to perform a quantum computation . due to the universality of quantum measurements proved by nielsen @xcite",
    ", all unitary transformations may be _ simulated _ using quantum measurements only .",
    "so , even if unitary transformations can not be used as primitives directly provided by quantum mechanic , all existing algorithms which are based on unitary transformations can be simulated on a measurement - based quantum computer .",
    "there exists different abstract models for classical computation ( e.g. turing machines , automata ) and for quantum computation ( e.g. quantum circuits , quantum turing machines ) .",
    "we introduce in this section a way of comparing such models with respect to their power .",

    "the proof given now focuses on one point : the set @xmath94 of states of the machine @xmath218 which simulates @xmath163 needs only be finite .",
    "technical issues concerning the movement of measurement heads are omitted in this presentation of the proof . with this simplification ,",
    "a machine @xmath218 is described by an automaton @xmath219 : the states of @xmath219 are nothing but the states of @xmath18 , and the transitions of @xmath219 , which may be labeled by @xmath220 , correspond to the transition function @xmath91 of @xmath18 , i.e. there is a transition of @xmath219 , labeled by @xmath103 , from @xmath221 to @xmath222 , iff @xmath223 such that @xmath224 .    this proof is based on a 3-level decomposition of the problem : _ steps of simulation of u _ , where a unitary transformation @xmath11 is simulated up to a pauli operator ( i.e. a step of simulation of @xmath11 on @xmath6 produces @xmath225 , where @xmath226 is a pauli operator ) ; _ full simulation of u _ , which combines steps of simulation ; and _ simulation of @xmath163 _ which combines full simulations of unitary transformations .",
    "the size @xmath217 of the circuit is finite , implying that the simulation of @xmath163 with a @xmath90 @xmath18 may be decomposed into @xmath217 full simulations , one for each unitary transformation @xmath215 .                according to the principles of measurement - based quantum computation @xcite ,",
    "a step of simulation of @xmath215 on @xmath213 consists in preparing an ancilla state which depends on @xmath215 , then in performing bell measurements between some qubits of @xmath213 and some qubits of the ancilla .",
    "for instance , if @xmath228 , then from a @xmath164-measurement followed by a @xmath165-measurement , the ancilla state is obtained .",
    "then a @xmath229-measurement followed by a @xmath230-measurement is performed .",
    "each of these four measurements has two possible outcomes , _ a priori _ giving rise to 16 final states for the automaton which controls this sequence of measurements .",
    "however , these 16 final states may be grouped into four states only , because the simulation of @xmath227 succeeds up to one of the four pauli operators .",
    "thus , in general , the automaton for a step of simulation of a unitary transformation @xmath11 has one entry state and four final states corresponding to the four pauli operators that should be applied next . for all @xmath231 ,",
    "it is obvious that a step of simulation of @xmath11 needs a finite number of states in the corresponding automaton ( the case of @xmath227 is shown in fig .",
    "@xmath232 ) .",
    "this automaton can be abstracted into a single node ( fig @xmath233 ) with one incoming transition and four outgoing transitions , for use at the next higher level which is the full simulation of @xmath11 .    for a given step of simulation of @xmath11 ,",
    "the full simulation of @xmath11 is given by an automaton where each state encapsulates a step of simulation ( fig.@xmath234 ) .",
    "this automaton is interpreted as follow : @xmath11 is simulated on a quantum state @xmath6 , so @xmath235 is obtained where @xmath226 is a pauli operator .",
    "if @xmath236 then the simulation is terminated , otherwise @xmath226 is simulated . from this step of simulation , the state @xmath237",
    "is obtained . if @xmath238 the simulation is terminated , otherwise @xmath239 is simulated , and so on .",
