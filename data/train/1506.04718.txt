    "recently , driving fields with nonvanishing ellipticity have attracted a great deal of attention as potential attosecond imaging tools @xcite . in particular , with regard to molecules , these types of fields provide access to a whole parameter range which would not be accessible otherwise .",
    "for instance , they may be used to probe degenerate orbitals , molecules that are difficult to align , and also allow the reconstruction of molecular orbitals from a single - shot measurement .",
    "they can also be employed in molecular imaging of randomly oriented molecules @xcite .",
    "this is made possible due to the physical mechanism behind high - order harmonic generation ( hhg ) , namely the laser - induced recombination of an electron with its parent ion @xcite . by using driving fields composed of orthogonally polarized waves",
    ", one can in principle control the angle with which the electron leaves , or subsequently returns to the ion @xcite .",
    "this control has been realized experimentally by employing fields with frequencies @xmath1 and @xmath2 and changing the relative phase between both waves @xcite .",
    "a particularly interesting example is related to hhg in aligned diatomic molecules . even if hhg is modeled within a very simple framework , namely the strong - field approximation ( sfa ) and the single - active electron ( sae ) , single - active orbital approximation , driving fields with non - vanishing ellipticity lead to interesting features .",
    "one of such features is the blurring and the splitting that occur in the two - center interference minima , which has been reported in @xcite .",
    "for linearly polarized fields , these minima are purely structural and have been related to electron recollision at different centers in the molecule ( for the first discussion of this minimum see @xcite and for reviews see , e.g. , @xcite and our recent publication @xcite ) .",
    "if , in contrast , the field is composed of orthogonally polarized waves , the interference condition changes .",
    "indeed , in previous work , we have derived a modified two - center interference condition which incorporates the electron s angle of return as a dynamic shift @xcite .",
    "this shift is critically influenced by the orbit along which the electron returns , and by the harmonic energy .",
    "hence , a coherent superposition will lead to the above - mentioned blurring and , in extreme cases , to the splitting .",
    "a legitimate question is , however , whether this shift can be observed under more realistic conditions , such as experiments . in @xcite",
    "we have anticipated a series of difficulties that may arise .",
    "first , even at the single - molecule response level , there are coherent superpositions of orbits , which will be detrimental for the identification of individual shifts .",
    "second , the core dynamics may mask these shifts further and has not been incorporated in this model @xcite .",
    "third , these shifts depend on the driving - field intensity , which will vary across the beam profile .",
    "fourth , there is no evidence that these shifts survive effects that occur during hhg propagation in a macroscopic medium .",
    "on the other hand , propagation may facilitate the observation of these shifts , since the long and the short orbits in the dominant pair phase match differently @xcite .",
    "thus , by carefully choosing the propagation conditions one may be able to select the contributions , and the shifts , associated with individual orbits .",
    "this type of selection has been successfully used in the past to optimize attosecond - pulse production ( for a seminal paper and a comprehensive review on this topic see , e.g. @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , it has even been shown that to obtain clear enough interference patterns between both orbits requires a very delicate tuning on the propagation conditions @xcite .",
    "further trajectory selection may be achieved by creating temporal or spatial gates , by playing around with the pulse shape , polarization and/or macroscopic conditions .",
    "examples of different trajectory - selection mechanisms are provided in the reviews @xcite .    in this paper , we perform a detailed analysis of how these shifts manifest themselves in a macroscopic medium , for individual orbits . we verify that the shifts behave in different ways for the long and short orbits , and are relatively stable across the beam .",
    "this implies that they are not washed out by propagation effects , but , in principle , can be seen in a more realistic , macroscopic scenario . in our investigations",
    "we consider @xmath0 to avoid multielectron effects associated with the core dynamics .",
    "we consider both linearly polarized fields and bichromatic orthogonally polarized fields of frequencies @xmath1 and @xmath3 .",
    "for the single - molecule response , we employ the strong - field approximation ( sfa ) and the steepest descent method .",

    "the results are presented in sec .",

    "we assume that the radiation generated by nonlinear interactions does not influence the strong driving field , which is a good approximation for the parameter range of interest .",

    "the far - field spectrum is composed of those components of the single atom dipole emission , from specific regions of the focal volume , for which there exists a wave vector along which the components add coherently @xcite .",
    "the degree of phase matching is usually dominated by the spatial variation of the intensity and carrier - envelope phase ( cep ) of the laser field through the interaction region .",

    "this is expected as variations in the intensity will change the energy position occupied by a specific harmonic .",
    "this is related to the fact , that , for low enough intensities , these shifts nearly coincide for the long and short orbits . in this case , the harmonic employed is located either at or beyond the cutoff frequency . as the intensity increases , there is a splitting in the shift , indicating that the plateau region has been reached .",
    "the behavior with regard to the field parameters depends very strongly on the orbit . if the two waves are in phase , for instance [ fig .",
    "[ fig : intensity1](a ) ] , the distinguishing features are a large residual shift after the cutoff and a very pronounced negative shift for the short orbit in the plateau region . physically , this means that if the electron is returning along the short orbit , for @xmath89 the angle of return is much larger .",
    "hence , it may be easier to single out in a realistic scenario , especially at high intensities .",
    "this behavior , however , changes with the relative phase .",
    "an example is provided in fig .",
    "[ fig : intensity1](b ) , which exhibits a smaller residual shift in the cutoff region and comparable shifts of opposite signal if the chosen harmonic is in the high - plateau energy region .",

    "our computations show that , for an appropriate choice of driving field and propagation conditions , the angle of return of an electron to its parent molecule manifests itself as a dynamic shift in the two - center structural minimum .",
    "this shift depends on the driving - field intensity , on the harmonic order and on the orbit along which the electron returns . for the dominant orbits , these shifts are visible both in the near- and far - field regimes , indicating that they can , in principle , be measured in experiments .",
    "in order to see these shifts clearly , one must select an individual orbit by employing gating mechanisms at the single molecule level and by using appropriate propagation conditions .",
    "it is of particular interest to enhance the short orbit and suppress the long orbit , as it phase matches on axis and leads to more dramatic variations in the angle of return with the laser - field parameters .",
    "if conflicting microscopic and macroscopic conditions are provided , the interference between long and short orbits may lead to inconclusive results . with that aim in mind ,",
    "we have selected the phase difference between both @xmath1 and @xmath3 driving waves as @xmath101 and have placed the focus before the gas jet .",
    "these choices are known to enhance the short orbit at the single - atom @xcite and macroscopic @xcite levels , respectively .",
    "nonetheless , there exist two obstacles towards seeing this shift , which , however , are well under control .",
    "first , for bichromatic fields , the shifts coming from the other half cycle will have opposite sign .",
    "this flip may be avoided for few - cycle pulses , by creating a spectral and temporal gate in order to select electron orbits from a single half cycle @xcite .",
    "this can be performed if for one of the dominant half cycles , the shifted minimum lies beyond the cutoff energy , and within the plateau for the other half cycle , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fewcyclevs mono ] .",
    "second , for molecules with a more complex electronic structure , the core dynamics may also play an important role , such that the single - active orbital , single - active electron approximation is not applicable @xcite .",
    "the regime for which this happens , however , can be avoided .",
    "indeed , recent experiments in @xmath110 have shown that interference effects stemming from the core dynamics are only relevant if the structural minimum provides a window for them to be observed .",
    "for high enough intensities , the energy position of the dynamical minimum lies outside this window and can no longer be observed @xcite .",
    "this is in agreement with the experimental findings in @xcite , which support the structural instead of the dynamical interference picture , and with the computations in @xcite , which show that multielectron effects are important in the cutoff , but not in the mid - plateau energy region .",
    "finally , our results suggest that , in principle , the angle with which the electron returns to the core can be controlled , either by changing the relative phase between both waves , or the driving - field intensity . as the intensity increases , a specific harmonic moves from the cutoff region across the plateau towards the ionization threshold , and",
    "this will alter the angle of return .",
    "this behavior is particularly critical for the short orbit , which , as discussed above , is the most favorable for macroscopic observations of this shift .",
    "furthermore , this angle can be mapped into a shift near the structural minimum , which can be modified by an appropriate parameter choice .",
    "this may be desirable in future experiments in order to investigate dynamic effects which would be obfuscated otherwise .",
