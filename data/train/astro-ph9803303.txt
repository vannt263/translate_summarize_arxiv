    "soft x  ray transients ( sxrts ) , when in outburst , show properties similar to those of persistent low mass x  ray binaries containing a neutron star ( lmxrbs ; white et al .",
    "1984 ; tanaka & shibazaki 1996 ; campana et al . 1998 ) . the large variations in the accretion rate that are characteristic of sxrts allow the investigation of a variety of regimes for the neutron stars in these systems which are inaccessible to persistent lmxrbs .",
    "while it is clear that , when in outbursts , sxrts are powered by accretion , the origin of the low luminosity x ",
    "ray emission that has been detected in the quiescent state of several sxrts is still unclear .",
    "an interesting possibility is that a millisecond radio pulsar ( msp ) turns on in the quiescent state of sxrts ( stella et al .",
    "this would provide a  missing link \" between persistent lmxrbs and recycled msps .",
    "aql x-1 is the most active sxrt known : more than 30 x  ray and/or optical outbursts have been detected so far .",
    "the companion star has been identified with the k1v variable star v1333 aql and an orbital period of 19 hr has been measured ( chevalier and ilovaisky 1991 ) .",
    "the outbursts of aql x-1 are generally characterised by a fast rise ( 510 d ) followed by a slow decay , with an @xmath4folding time of 3070  d ( see tanaka & shibazaki 1996 and campana et al .",
    "1998 and references therein ) .",
    "type i x  ray bursts were discovered during the declining phase of an outburst ( koyama et al .",
    "1981 ) , testifying to the presence of a neutron star .",
    "ray luminosities are in the @xmath5 range ( for the @xmath6 kpc distance inferred from its optical counterpart ; thorstensen et al . 1978 ) .",
    "close to the outburst maximum the x  ray spectrum is soft with an equivalent bremsstrahlung temperature of @xmath7  kev .",
    "sporadic observations of aql x-1 during the early part of the outburst decay ( czerny et al .",
    "1987 ; tanaka & shibazaki 1996 ; verbunt et al .",
    "1994 ) showed that when the source luminosity drops below @xmath8 the spectrum changes to a power law with a photon index of @xmath2 , extending up to energies of @xmath9 kev ( harmon et al . 1996 ) .",
    "rosat pspc observations revealed aql x-1 in quiescence on three occasions at a level of @xmath1 ( 0.42.4 kev ; verbunt et al .",
    "1994 ) . in this lower energy band",
    "the spectrum is considerably softer and consistent with a black body temperature of @xmath10  kev .",
    "an outburst from aql x-1 reaching a peak luminosity of @xmath11 ( 210 kev ) was discovered and monitored starting from mid - february , 1997 with the rossixte all sky monitor ( asm ; levine et al .",
    "six observations were carried out with the bepposax narrow field instruments ( nfis ) starting from march 8@xmath12 , 1997 ( see table 1 ) , with the aim of studying the final stages of the outburst decay .",
    "1a shows the light curve of the aql x-1 outburst as observed by the rossixte asm and bepposax mecs .",
    "the first part of the outburst can be fit by a gaussian with sigma @xmath13  d. this is not uncommon in sxrts ( e.g. in the case of 4u 160852 ; lochner & roussel - dupr 1994 ) .",
    "the flux decay rate changed dramatically around mjd 50512 ( march 5@xmath12 , 1997 ) . at the time of the first bepposax observation ( which started on march 8@xmath12 , 1997 ) the source luminosity was decreasing very rapidly , fading by about 30% in 11 hr , from a maximum level of @xmath14 .",
    "the second observation took place on march 12@xmath12 , 1997 when the source , a factor of @xmath15 fainter on average , reduced its flux by about 25% in 12 hr .",
    "in the subsequent four observations the source luminosity attained a constant level of @xmath16 , consistent with previous measurements of the quiescent luminosity of aql x-1 ( verbunt et al . 1994 ) . the sharp decrease after mjd 50512",
    "is well described by an exponential decay with an @xmath4folding time @xmath17 d.    the bepposax lecs , mecs and pds spectra during the fast decay phase , as well as those obtained by summing up all the observations pertaining to quiescence , can be fit with a model consisting of a black body plus a power law ( see table 2 and fig .",
    "the soft black body component remained nearly constant in temperature ( @xmath18 kev ) , but its radius decreased by a factor of @xmath19 from the decay phase to quiescence .",
    "the equivalent radius in quiescence ( @xmath20  km ) is consistent with the rosat results ( verbunt et al .",
    "the power law component changed substantially from the decay phase to quiescence : during the decay the photon index was @xmath21 , while in quiescence it hardened to @xmath22 .",
    "the two values are different with @xmath23 confidence ( see table 1 ) . the ratio of the 0.510 kev luminosities in the power law and black body components decreased by a factor of five between the first bepposax observation and quiescence .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      @xmath25 spectra from the lecs and mecs ( and pds for the first observation ) detectors have been considered .",
    "the spectra corresponding to the quiescent state have been summed up , in order to increase the statistics and an upper limit from the summed pds data was also used to better constrain the power law slope .    @xmath26 unabsorbed x  ray luminosity in the energy range 0.510 kev . in the case of the first observation",
    "the pds data were included in the fit ( the unabsorbed 0.5100 kev luminosity amounts to @xmath27 ) .",
    "the bepposax observations enabled us to follow for the first time the evolution of a sxrt outburst down to quiescence .",
    "the sharp flux decay leading to the quiescent state of aql x-1 is reminiscent of the final evolution of dwarf novae outbursts ( e.g. ponman et al .",
    "1995 ; osaki 1996 ) , although there are obvious differences with respect to the x  ray luminosities and spectra involved in the two cases , likely resulting from the different efficiencies in the gravitational energy release between white dwarfs and neutron stars .",
    "models of low mass x  ray transient outbursts hosting an old neutron star or a black hole are largely built in analogy with dwarf novae outbursts . in particular , van paradijs ( 1996 ) showed that the different range of time - averaged mass accretion rates over which the dwarf nova and low mass x ",
    "ray transient outbursts were observed to take place is well explained by the higher level of disk irradiation caused by the higher accretion efficiency of neutron stars and black holes .",
    "however , the outburst evolution of low mass x  ray transients presents important differences .",
    "in particular , the steepening in the x  ray flux decrease of aql x-1 has no clear parallel in low mass x ",
    "ray transients containing black hole candidates ( bhcs ) .",
    "the best sampled light curves of these sources show an exponential - like decay ( sometimes with a superposed secondary outburst ) with an @xmath4folding time of @xmath29 d and extending up to four decades in flux , with no indication of a sudden steepening ( chen et al .",
    "in addition , bhc transients display a larger luminosity range between outburst peak and quiescence than neutron star sxrts ( garcia et al . 1998 and references therein ) .",
    "being the mass donor stars and the binary parameters quite similar in the two cases , it appears natural to attribute these differences to the different nature of the underlying object : neutron stars possess a surface and , likely , a magnetosphere , while bhcs do not .",
    "when in outburst accretion down to the neutron star surface takes place in sxrts , as testified by the similarity of their properties with those of persistent lmxrbs , especially the occurrence of type i bursts and the x  ray spectra and luminosities . the mass inflow rate during the outburst decay decreases , causing the expansion of the magnetospheric radius , @xmath30 .",
    "thus , accretion onto the neutron star surface can continue as long as the centrifugal drag exerted by the corotating magnetosphere on the accreting material is weaker than gravity ( illarionov & sunyaev 1975 ; stella et al .",
    "this occurs above a limiting luminosity @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the gravitational constant ; @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 g and @xmath36 ms are the neutron star mass , radius , magnetic field and spin period , respectively ( here and in the following we assume @xmath37 and @xmath38 cm ) . as @xmath30 reaches the corotation radius , @xmath39 , accretion onto the surface is inhibited and a lower accretion luminosity ( @xmath40 ) of @xmath41 is released . after this luminosity gap",
    "the source enters the propeller regime .",
    "if the mass inflow rate decreases further , the expansion of @xmath30 can continue up to the light cylinder radius , @xmath42 , providing a lower limit to the accretion luminosity that can be emitted in the propeller regime @xmath43 .",
    "below @xmath44 the radio pulsar mechanism may turn on and the pulsar relativistic wind interacts with the incoming matter pushing it outwards .",
    "matter inflowing through the roche lobe is stopped by the radio pulsar radiation pressure , giving rise to a shock front ( illarionov & sunyaev 1975 ; shaham & tavani 1991 ) .",
    "clearly these regimes have no equivalent in the case of black hole accretion .      during the february - march 1997 outburst of aql x-1 , rossixte observations led to the discovery of a nearly coherent modulation at @xmath45  hz ( @xmath46 ms ) during a type i x  ray burst .",
    "a single qpo peak , with a centroid frequency ranging from @xmath47 to 830 hz , was also observed at two different flux levels , when the persistent luminosity was @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( zhang et al .",
    "1998 ) . in the presence of a single qpo peak , the magnetospheric and sonic point beat frequency models ( alpar & shaham 1985 ; miller et al . 1997 ) interpretation is ambiguous in that the qpo peak could represent either the keplerian frequency at the inner disk boundary or the beat frequency .",
    "moreover , the burst periodicity at @xmath45  hz may represent the neutron star spin frequency , @xmath50 , or half its value ( zhang et al . 1998 ) . in either cases ,",
    "the possibility that accretion onto the neutron star surface takes place even in the quiescent state of aql x-1 faces serious difficulties : for a quiescent luminosity of order @xmath51 a magnetic field of only @xmath52 g would be required , in order to fulfill the condition @xmath53 .",
    "for such a low magnetic field , aql  x-1 and , by inference , lmxrbs with khz qpos can hardly be the progenitors of recycled msps .",
    "more crucially , the marked steepening in the outburst decay that takes place below @xmath54 , is accompanied by a marked spectral hardening , resulting from a sudden decrease of the flux in the black body spectral component .",
    "this is clearly suggestive of a transition taking place deep in the gravitational well of the neutron star , where most of the x ",
    "rays are produced .",
    "the most appealing mechanism is a transition to the propeller regime , where most of the inflowing matter is stopped at the magnetospheric boundary ( zhang , yu & zhang 1998 ) . in fig .",
    "1a , the luminosity at mjd 50512 is identified with @xmath55 and the lower horizontal lines indicate the luminosity interval during which aql x-1 is likely in the propeller regime .    additional information on the neutron star magnetic field ( and spin ) can be inferred as follows .",
    "the observed ratio of the luminosity , @xmath56 , when the qpo at @xmath57  hz were detected and the luminosity @xmath58 when the centrifugal barrier closes is @xmath59 . at @xmath58 the keplerian frequency of matter at the magnetospheric boundary is , by definition , equal to the spin frequency , i.e. @xmath60 or @xmath61  hz for aql x-1 .",
    "based on beat - frequency models , at @xmath56 the keplerian frequency at the inner disk boundary can be either @xmath62  hz or @xmath63  hz , depending on whether the single khz qpos observed corresponds to the keplerian or the beat frequency . in the magnetospheric beat - frequency models , simple theory predicts that the keplerian frequency at the magnetospheric boundary is @xmath64 ; in the radiation pressure - dominated regime relevant to the case at hand , the ghosh and lamb ( 1992 ) model predicts instead @xmath65 .",
    "therefore we expect @xmath66 and @xmath67 , in the two models , respectively .",
    "such a low ratio clearly favors the interpretation in which @xmath62  hz and @xmath68  hz . in the sonic point beat - frequency model ( miller et al .",
    "1997 ) , the innermost disk radius is well within the magnetosphere , implying that the keplerian frequency at the magnetospheric boundary is @xmath69 . in this case",
    "all possible combinations of @xmath50 and @xmath70 are allowed . by using the observed @xmath58 , a neutron star magnetic field of @xmath71  g ( depending on the adopted model of the disk - magnetosphere interaction )",
    "is obtained in the case @xmath68  hz and @xmath72  g in the case @xmath73  hz .",
    "once in the propeller regime , the accretion efficiency decreases further as the magnetosphere expands for decreasing mass inflow rates ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "the @xmath75  d exponential - like luminosity decline observed with bepposax is considerably faster than the propeller accretion luminosity extrapolated from the first part of the outburst ( e.g. the gaussian profile shown by the dashed line in fig .",
    "we note here that the spectral transition accompanying the onset of the centrifugal barrier may also modify the irradiation properties of the accretion disk , contributing to x  ray luminosity turn off .",
    "alternatively , an active contribution of the `` propeller '' mechanism or the neutron star spin - down energy dissipated into the inflowing matter can not be excluded .",
    "it is unlikely that the quiescent luminosity of aql  x-1 is powered by magnetospheric accretion in the propeller regime . as shown in fig .",
    "1a , the quiescent x  ray luminosity is probably lower than the minimum magnetospheric accretion luminosity @xmath76 allowed in the propeller phase ( this remains true for @xmath77 g if @xmath68 hz , and for @xmath78 g if @xmath73 hz ) .",
    "moreover the bepposax x  ray spectrum shows a pronounced decrease in the power law to black body flux ratio together with a flattening of the power law component between the fast decay phase and quiescence , suggesting that a transition to shock emission from the interaction of a radio pulsar wind with the matter outflowing from the companion star has taken place . note that an x  ray spectrum with a slope of @xmath79 has been observed from the radio pulsar psr  b125963 immersed in the wind of its be star companion .",
    "models of this interaction predict that a power law x  ray spectrum with a slope around @xmath79 should be produced for a wide range of parameters ( tavani & arons 1997 ) .    the additional soft x ",
    "ray component observed during the outburst decay ( see table 2 ) might be emitted at the polar caps as a result of the residual neutron star accretion in the propeller phase .",
    "note that the equivalent black body radius decreases for decreasing x  ray luminosities , just as it would be expected if the magnetospheric boundary expanded .",
    "alternatively , the black body - like spectral component observed in quiescence could be due to the streaming of energetic particles that hit the polar caps , in close analogy to the soft x  ray component observed , in msps , at the weaker level of @xmath80 ( becker & trmper 1997 ) .    assuming a magnetic field in the range derived in section 3.1 ( i.e. @xmath81 g for @xmath82 hz and @xmath83 g for @xmath84 hz )",
    ", we can consistently explain the @xmath1 quiescent x  ray luminosity as powered by a radio pulsar enshrouded by matter outflowing from the companion star , if the conversion efficiency of spin - down luminosity to x  ray is @xmath85% .",
    "this is consistent with modeling and observations of enshrouded pulsars ( tavani 1991 ; verbunt et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "there are chances of observing a msp ( a simple scaling from msps implies a signal at 400 mhz of @xmath86 mjy ; see kulkarni et al .",
    "1990 ) , even though the emission would probably be sporadic , like in the case of the pulsar psr  174424a due to the large amount of circumstellar matter ( see lyne et al . 1991 ; shaham & tavani 1991 ) .    in summary aql  x-1 appears to provide the first example of an old fast rotating neutron stars undergoing a transition to the propeller regime at first , followed by a transition to the radio pulsar regime , as the transient x  ray emission approaches its quiescent level .",
    "therefore , aql x-1 ( and possibly sxrts in general ) likely represents the long - sought `` missing link '' between lmxrbs and recycled msps ."
