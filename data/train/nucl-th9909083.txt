    "for three - body systems the faddeev equations are the fundamental equations .",
    "after one iteration they possess connected kernels , consequently they are effectively fredholm integral equations of second kind .",
    "thus the fredholm alternative applies : at certain energy either the homogeneous or inhomogeneous equations have solutions .",
    "three - body bound states correspond to the solutions of the homogeneous faddeev equations at real energies , resonances , as usual in quantum mechanics , are related to their complex - energy solutions .    the situation becomes more complicated if the coulomb potential enters into the game .",
    "the faddeev equations were derived for short range interactions and if we simply plug - in a coulomb - like potential they become singular .",
    "the solution has been formulated in the faddeev - merkuriev theory @xcite on a mathematically sound and elegant way via integral equations with connected ( compact ) kernels and configuration space differential equations with asymptotic boundary conditions .",
    "recently , along the concept of a  three - potential  picture , a novel method has been proposed for treating the three - body coulomb problem via solving the set of faddeev - noble and lippmann - schwinger integral equations in coulomb  sturmian - space representation .",
    "the method was elaborated first for bound - state problems @xcite with repulsive coulomb plus nuclear potential , then it was extended for calculating @xmath1 scattering at energies below the breakup threshold @xcite . in these calculations",
    "an excellent agreements with the results of other well established methods were found and the efficiency and the accuracy of the method were demonstrated .",
    "also atomic bound - state problems with attractive coulomb interactions were considered @xcite .",
    "the mathematical validity of the procedure , in the context of the faddeev - merkuriev theory , has also been established @xcite .    in this article",
    "we seek to extend this novel method for calculating resonant states , the complex - energy solutions of the homogeneous faddeev - type integral equations .",
    "first , along the method of ref .",
    "@xcite , we recapitulate the solution of the homogeneous integral equations , then we show how to continue analytically the green s operators onto the unphysical sheet . as an illustration of the feasibility of this method",
    "we calculate a model three-@xmath0 system interacting via short - range plus repulsive coulomb interaction .",
    "the hamiltonian of a three - body coulombic system reads @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the three - body kinetic energy operator , @xmath4 stands for the three - body potential and @xmath5 denotes the coulomb - like interaction in the subsystem @xmath0 .",
    "we use throughout the usual configuration - space jacobi coordinates @xmath6 and @xmath7 . thus @xmath5 only depends on @xmath6 ( @xmath8 ) , while @xmath4 depends on both @xmath6 and @xmath7 coordinates ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the physical role of a coulomb - like potential is twofold .",
    "its long - distance part modifies the asymptotic motion , while its short - range part strongly correlates the two - body subsystems .",
    "merkuriev proposed to split the potentials into short - range and long - range parts in the three - body configuration space via a cut - off function @xmath10 @xcite , @xmath11 and @xmath12 . \\label{potm}\\ ] ] the function @xmath13 is defined such that it separates the asymptotic two - body sector @xmath14 from the rest of the three - body configuration space . on the region of @xmath14",
    "the splitting function @xmath13 asymptotically tends to @xmath15 and on the complementary asymptotic region of the configuration space it tends to @xmath16 .",
    "rigorously , @xmath14 is defined as a part of the three - body configuration space where the condition @xmath17 is satisfied .",
    "so , in @xmath14 the short - range part @xmath18 coincides with the original coulomb - like potential @xmath5 and in the complementary region vanishes , whereas the opposite holds true for @xmath19 . from its",
    "construction follows that if @xmath20 is chosen big enough @xmath21 in the three - body hilbert space does not support any bound state @xcite .",
    "this phenomena is analogous to the observation that some special atomic three - body systems does not have any bound states @xcite .",
    "note that for repulsive coulomb interactions one can also adopt noble s approach @xcite , which can be considered as a special case of merkuriev s splitting , where the splitting is performed in the two - body configuration space .",
    "then @xmath19 coincides with the whole coulomb interaction and @xmath18 with the short range nuclear potential .    in the faddeev procedure we spilt the wave function into three components @xmath22 here",
    "@xmath23 is the resolvent of the long - ranged hamiltonian @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the complex energy parameter .",
    "the wave - function components satisfy the homogeneous faddeev - merkuriev integral equations @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the resolvent of the channel long - ranged hamiltonian @xmath28 merkuriev has proved that egs .",
    "( [ fn - eq ] ) possess compact kernels for positive @xmath29 energies , and this property remains valid also for complex energies @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "we solve these integral equations in coulomb  sturmian - space representation .",
    "the coulomb - sturmian ( cs ) functions are defined by @xmath32^{1/2 } ( 2br)^{l+1 } \\exp(-b r ) l_n^{2l+1}(2b r ) ,   \\label{basisr}\\ ] ] with @xmath33 and @xmath34 being the radial and orbital angular momentum quantum numbers , respectively , and @xmath35 is the size parameter of the basis .",
    "the cs functions @xmath36 form a biorthonormal discrete basis in the radial two - body hilbert space ; the biorthogonal partner defined by @xmath37 .",
    "since the three - body hilbert space is a direct product of two - body hilbert spaces , an appropriate basis is the angular momentum coupled direct product ( the possible other quantum numbers are implicitly assumed ) @xmath38 with this basis the completeness relation takes the form @xmath39 note that in the three - body hilbert space , three equivalent bases belonging to fragmentation @xmath0 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are possible .    in ref .",
    "@xcite a novel approximation scheme has been proposed to the faddeev - type integral equations @xmath42 i.e.  the short - range potential @xmath18 in the three - body hilbert space is taken to have a separable form , viz .",
    "@xmath43 where @xmath44 . in ref .",
    "@xcite the validity of the approximation were proved .",
    "the argumentation in ref .",
    "@xcite relies on the square integrable property of the term @xmath45 , @xmath46 .",
    "thus this approximation is justified also for complex energies as long as this property remains valid . in eq .",
    "( [ sepfe ] ) the ket and bra states are defined for different fragmentation , depending on the environment of the potential operators in the equations .",
    "now , with this approximation , the solution of the homogeneous faddeev - merkuriev equations turns into solution of matrix equations for the component vector @xmath47 @xmath48 where @xmath49 .",
    "a unique solution exists if and only if @xmath50^{-1 } - \\underline{v}^{(s ) } \\ } = 0.\\ ] ]    the green s operator @xmath51 is a solution of the auxiliary three - body problem with the hamiltonian @xmath52 . to determine it uniquely one should start again from faddeev - type integral equations , which does not seem to lead any further , or from the triad of lippmann - schwinger equations @xcite .",
    "the triad of lippmann - schwinger equations , although they do not possess compact kernels and thus they are not amenable for practical calculations , also define the solution in an unique way .",
    "they are , in fact , related to the adjoint representation of the faddeev operator @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath53 , however , has a peculiar property that it supports bound state only in the subsystem @xmath0 , and thus it has only one kind of asymptotic channel , the @xmath0 channel .",
    "for such a system one single lippmann - schwinger equation is sufficient for an unique solution @xcite .",
    "the appropriate equation takes the form @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the resolvent channel - distorted long - range hamiltonian , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the auxiliary potential @xmath58 depends on the coordinate @xmath7 .",
    "it is defined such that it does not support any bound state and has the asymptotic form @xmath59 as @xmath60 .",
    "in fact , @xmath58 is an effective coulomb interaction between the center of mass of the subsystem @xmath0 ( with charge @xmath61 ) and the third particle ( with charge @xmath62 ) .",
    "its role is to compensate the coulomb tail of the potentials @xmath63 in @xmath14 .",
    "if @xmath58 is a repulsive coulomb potential the requirement that it should not support bound states can can easily be fulfilled . for attractive @xmath58 the infinitely many bound states",
    "should be projected out , which leads to a non - local potential .",
    "it is important to realize that in this approach to get the solution only the matrix elements @xmath64 are needed , i.e. only the representation of the green s operator on a compact subset of the hilbert space are required .",
    "so , although eq .",
    "( [ lsgc ] ) does not possesses a compact kernel on the whole three - body hilbert space its matrix form is effectively a compact equation on the subspace spanned by finite number of cs functions @xcite .",
    "thus we can perform an approximation , similar to eq .",
    "( [ sepfe ] ) , on the potential @xmath65 in eq .",
    "( [ lsgc ] ) , with bases of the same fragmentation @xmath0 applied on both sides of the operator .",
    "now the integral equation reduces to an analogous set of linear algebraic equation with the operators replaced by their matrix representations .",
    "the solution is given by @xmath66^{-1 } = [ \\underline{\\widetilde{g}}_\\alpha ( z)]^{-1 } - \\underline{u}^{\\alpha}.\\ ] ]    the most crucial point in this procedure is the calculation of the matrix elements @xmath67 , since the potential matrix elements @xmath68 and @xmath69 can always be calculated numerically by making use of the transformation of jacobi coordinates . the green s operator @xmath55 is a resolvent of the sum of two commuting hamiltonians , @xmath70 , where @xmath71 and @xmath72 , which act in different two - body hilbert spaces .",
    "thus , using the convolution theorem the three - body green s operator @xmath55 equates to a convolution integral of two - body green s operators , i.e. @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the contour @xmath76 should be taken counterclockwise around the continuous spectrum of @xmath77 so that @xmath78 is analytic in the domain encircled by @xmath76 .    to examine the structure of the integrand",
    "let us shift the spectrum of @xmath78 by taking @xmath79 with positive @xmath80 . by doing so ,",
    "the two spectra become well separated and the spectrum of @xmath81 can be encircled .",
    "next the contour @xmath76 is deformed analytically in such a way that the upper part descends to the unphysical riemann sheet of @xmath81 , while the lower part of @xmath76 can be detoured away from the cut [ see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ] .",
    "the contour still encircles the branch cut singularity of @xmath81 , but in the @xmath82 limit it now avoids the singularities of @xmath83 .",
    "moreover , by continuing to negative values of @xmath80 , in order that we can calculate resonances , the branch cut and pole singularities of @xmath83 move onto the second riemann sheet of @xmath81 and , at the same time , the branch cut of @xmath81 moves onto the second riemann sheet of @xmath83 .",
    "thus , the mathematical conditions for the contour integral representation of @xmath84 in eq .",
    "( [ contourint ] ) can be fulfilled also for complex energies with negative imaginary part . in this respect",
    "there is only a gradual difference between the bound- and resonant - state calculations .",
    "now , the matrix elements @xmath85 can be cast in the form @xmath86 where the corresponding cs matrix elements of the two - body green s operators in the integrand are known analytically for all complex energies @xcite , and thus the convolution integral can be performed also in the practice .",
    "to illustrate the feasibility of this method we examine the convergence of the results for three - body resonant - state energies .",
    "for this purpose we take an ali  bodmer - type toy - model for the charged three-@xmath0 system interacting via @xmath87-wave short - range interaction . to improve its properties",
    "we add a phenomenological three - body potential . adopting noble s splitting we have @xmath88 with @xmath89 mev , @xmath90 mev , @xmath91 fm , @xmath92 fm , and @xmath93 we use units such that @xmath94 mev , @xmath95 mev fm .",
    "the mass of the @xmath0-particle is chosen as @xmath96 , where @xmath97 denotes the mass of the nucleon .",
    "the three body potential is taken to have gaussian form @xmath98 where @xmath99 , @xmath100 mev and @xmath101 fm . here",
    "@xmath102 stands for the position vector of @xmath103-th particle in the center of mass frame of three-@xmath0 system .",
    "we select states with total angular momentum @xmath104 . in table",
    "i we show the convergence of the energy of the ground - state and of the first resonant - state with respect to @xmath105 , the number of cs functions employed in the expansion .",
    "the selected resonance is the experimentally well - known sharp state which has a great relevance in nuclear synthesis .    for comparison",
    "we have recalculated the results of ref.@xcite , where a two - channel model has been proposed for the three-@xmath0 system .",
    "table ii shows a good agreement between the two independent methods as far as the position of the resonance is considered . for the width of the resonant state we got an order of magnitude less which indicate an order of magnitude longer lifetime .",
    "the origin of the discrepancy , in our opinion , could be due to the not proper implementation of the asymptotic boundary conditions in ref .",
    "in this article we have proposed a new method for calculating resonances in three - body coulombic systems .",
    "the homogeneous faddeev - merkuriev integral equations were solved for complex energies . for this , being an integral equation approach , the no boundary conditions are needed .",
    "the procedure is an extension of the well - established coulomb - sturmian separable expansion approach @xcite .",
    "in fact , the extension is nothing else but the proper analytic continuation of the contour integral representation of the green s operator . in the non - coulomb case",
    "the method is readily applicable , only the coulomb green s operators have to be replaced by the free one .",
