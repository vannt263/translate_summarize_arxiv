    "resonance free regions near the essential spectrum have been extensively studied since the foundational work of lax - phillips @xcite and vainberg @xcite .",

    "the distribution of resonances is also of geometric interest as it is closely related to the dynamical structure of the set of trapped classical trajectories .",
    "typically , more trapping results in more resonances near the essential spectrum .",
    "in particular , the largest resonance free regions exist when there is no trapping .",
    "in this paper we study logarithmic resonance free regions for nontrapping manifolds with two ends , a cusp and a funnel .",
    "general hypotheses are given in  [ assumptions ] , but consider the following    * example .",
