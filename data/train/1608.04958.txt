    "numerous papers have in recent years laid the foundation for causal mediation analysis in the context of linear and nonlinear models for continuous , binary , and survival outcomes , and likewise in situations where an interaction may be present between the exposure and the mediator.@xmath0 these advances have clarified conditions under which traditional mediation techniques for estimating the indirect effect , such as the  product \" and  difference \" methods are equivalent.@xmath1 in a recent commentary on mediation analysis for a survival outcome , vanderweele@xmath2 established that the well - known equivalence between the difference and product methods in linear models with no exposure - mediator interaction holds approximately for survival data under a cox proportional hazards model if the outcome remains rare over the follow - up .",
    "he further indicated that this equivalence holds exactly for the mean of the log of a survival outcome under a certain accelerated failure time ( aft ) model .",
    "this result confirmed previous findings by tein and mackinnon@xmath3 who previously showed in simulation studies that under a weibull aft model the product and difference estimators were consistent for the indirect effect ; however , both tein and mackinnon@xmath3 and vanderweele@xmath2 only considered a setting in which censoring was absent . in a more recent simulation study , gelfand , mackinnon , derubeius , and",
    "baraldi@xmath4 demonstrated that in the presence of right censoring the product and difference estimators are not necessarily equivalent under a weibull aft model .",
    "they also noted that the product method remained unaffected by right censoring , while the difference method underestimated the indirect effect in their simulation studies.@xmath4 the results of our paper will provide the theoretical underpinning for the conclusions drawn by tein and mackinnon@xmath3 and gelfand et al.@xmath4 in their simulation studies .",
    "we supply formal justification for their conjecture that the difference method will often fail to provide a consistent estimator of the indirect effect under an aft model even when the product method does .",
    "+ specifically , in this paper , we formally establish that the equivalence between the product and difference method generally fails in the presence of censoring , primarily due to lack of consistency of the difference method arising from a form of model misspecification .",
    "we will formally show that this form of model misspecification gives rise to bias in the difference method estimator when censoring is present .",
    "however , in the absence of censoring , this form of model misspecification is relatively benign and does not generally induce bias in the estimated indirect effect using the different method .",
    "this misspecification does not arise in the special case of normal mediator - normal outcome model , and , thus , both difference and product estimators are consistent in the presence of independent censoring .",
    "in a simulation study , we confirm these results for normal and weibull distributed time - to - event outcomes , respectively .",
    "we also consider the implication of our findings in estimating the indirect effect of hiv status mediated by height for age at sexual maturity in the pediatric hiv / aids cohort study ( phacs ) and pediatric aids clinical trials group 219c ( pactg ) studies and the indirect effect of combination treatment mediated by viral suppression on time to death or opportunistic infection among hiv - infected adults using multiple studies of the aids clinical trial group.@xmath5      throughout , we focus on a binary exposure @xmath6 , continuous mediator @xmath7 , and time - to - event outcome @xmath8",
    ". we do not explicitly include pre - exposure covariates , and therefore , for all practical purposes , our analysis may be viewed as if we had conditioned on a specific level of such covariates .",
    "we expect that the results would continue to hold if the same set of confounders were included in all regression models .",
    "in addition , we assume no unmeasured confounding for the effects of @xmath6 on @xmath7 and @xmath8 and the effects of @xmath7 on @xmath8 . let @xmath9 denote the counterfactual mediator had the exposure taken value @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote the counterfactual outcome had exposure taken value @xmath10 . in mediation analysis , we will also consider the counterfactual outcome @xmath12 had exposure taken value @xmath13 and the mediator taken the value it would have under @xmath14 .",
    "+ we consider the following models for the survival outcome @xmath8 and mediator @xmath7 :    @xmath15    @xmath16    where @xmath17 has mean zero and is independent of @xmath6 , @xmath18 follows a known distribution and is independent of @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and @xmath19 is some positive scale parameter .",
    "note that model @xmath20 assumes no exposure - mediator interaction , which is an essential assumption to obtain simple expressions for the natural direct and indirect effects of primary concern in this paper .",
    "+ as shown in the appendix , under treatment randomization ( a1 ) and cross - world counterfactuals independence ( a2 ) assumptions , the average natural ( or pure ) direct or indirect effects on the log mean scale is nonparametrically identified .",
    "the natural direct ( @xmath21 ) and indirect ( @xmath22 ) effects for the log - survival time are defined in terms of these counterfactuals and under models @xmath20 and @xmath23 we have that :    @xmath24    letting @xmath25 and @xmath26 , this leads to a natural direct effect of @xmath27 and a natural indirect effect given by the product rule @xmath28 .",
    "the expression for the difference method is obtained upon marginalizing over @xmath7 by positing a second accelerated failure time model for @xmath8 as a function of @xmath6 only , which shall be referred to as the reduced form model and is typically specified as followed :    @xmath29    where @xmath30 follows the same distribution as @xmath18 in @xmath20 , and @xmath31 is a positive scale parameter .",
    "this specification is also used in both the vanderweele@xmath32 and tein and mackinnon@xmath33 papers . under this formulation",
    ", we see that @xmath34 is the total effect of @xmath6 on the mean of @xmath8 on the log scale and satisfies :    @xmath35    this equivalence follows from direct substitution of equation @xmath20 into @xmath36 and evaluation of total effect @xmath34 .      as we discuss further below , equation @xmath37",
    "is generally misspecified because the error distribution specified in models @xmath20 and @xmath23 completely determine the error distribution in model @xmath36 as a convolution of these two laws ( see appendix ( a7 ) ) .",
    "unless the error distribution of model @xmath36 is carefully chosen to match this convolution , the model will generally be mis - specified .",
    "this convolution seldom reduces to a standard model typically implemented in off - the - shelf software when @xmath7 and @xmath8 follow standard distributions .",
    "for instance , suppose that @xmath7 is assumed normal and @xmath8 assumed to follow a weibull distribution , then the reduced form error distribution is in principle a convolution of a normal with a weibull distribution , which is neither normal nor weibull and is in fact not of a standard closed form ( see appendix ( a10 ) ) . in this case , the assumption that the error in the reduced model is weibull is clearly incorrect .",
    "a fairly prominent setting in which the reduced form model is typically correctly specified is the normal mediator - normal outcome model , in which case the error distribution of model @xmath36 is also normal . + as shown in the appendix , in the absence of censoring , maximum likelihood estimation of the reduced form model will generally be consistent for the total effect @xmath38 even if the error distribution is misspecified .",
    "this follows from the fact that in the absence of censoring , consistency of regression parameters in an aft model mainly depends on correct specification of the regression model , not on the choice of error distribution .",
    "in contrast , result ( a9 ) in the appendix formally establishes that in the presence of censoring , maximum likelihood estimation of the reduced form model will generally fail to be consistent when the error distribution is incorrect because the corresponding score function fails to be unbiased , which is a basic requirement of consistency .",
    "in contrast , under correct specification of models @xmath20 and @xmath23 , the product method is guaranteed to be consistent whether or not censoring is present and irrespective of a choice of model for residual errors .",
    "+ on these theoretical grounds , we conclude that one should exert caution when using the difference method in the presence of censoring , as it is prone to model misspecification of model @xmath36 even when models @xmath20 and @xmath23 are correctly specified .",
    "when these two models are correctly specified , the product method generally gives a valid estimator for the indirect effect . in the next section ,",
    "we illustrate this phenomenon in extensive simulation studies and two separate applications .",
    "in simulation studies , we considered two scenarios , one where @xmath8 is normal and the other where @xmath8 is weibull distributed . in both settings , @xmath6 was generated from a bernoulli with probability of .5 . in the first",
    "setting , @xmath7 was generated from a normal model with mean @xmath39 and variance 1 , where @xmath40 .",
    "the time - to - event outcome , @xmath8 , was generated from a normal distribution with mean @xmath41 and variance 1 , where @xmath42 .",
    "we investigated the following three censoring scenarios : no censoring , 70% right - censored and the remaining 30% with observed event times , and 70%",
    "right - censored and the remaining 30% interval - censored .",
    "models @xmath20 , @xmath23 , and @xmath36 were fit using survreg in r , with gaussian time - to - event distribution for models @xmath20 and @xmath36 and a linear regression for @xmath23 . for the right - censoring only situation ,",
    "a censoring distribution was generated from a normal distribution to yield approximately @xmath43 censored .",
    "for the right and interval - censoring case , the same right - censoring distribution was used , and a censoring interval was generated for observed event times .",
    "the length of the censoring interval was generated from a multinomial distribution ; to choose where on the interval the true time occurred , we generated a proportion from a uniform(0,1 ) distribution .",
    "+ for the second setting with a weibull distributed time - to - event , the mediator @xmath7 was generated from a normal model with mean @xmath39 and variance 1 , where @xmath44 .",
    "lastly , the time - to - event outcome was generated as @xmath45 , resulting in weibull error distribution , where @xmath46 , @xmath19 is .25 , and @xmath47 is the extreme value density . for this model , we investigated the following two censoring scenarios : no censoring and 30% right - censored .",
    "models @xmath20 , @xmath23 , and @xmath36 were fit using survreg in r with a weibull distribution for time . for the right censoring scenario ,",
    "a censoring distribution was generated for a weibull distribution to yield @xmath48 censored .",
    "we performed 10,000 simulations for each scenario , with sample size ranging from 800 to 4,000 .",
    "+ we evaluated the following characteristics for each distribution and censoring type : absolute proportion difference between the estimators ( @xmath49 ) and proportion bias of each estimator ( @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) , where @xmath52 is the true indirect effect , @xmath53 is the monte carlo mean of the product estimator , and @xmath54 is the monte carlo mean of the difference estimator .",
    "simulation results for each scenario are summarized in figures 1 and 2 .",
    "+    .57      +    .57     .57      +    .57     figure 1a shows the absolute proportion difference between the product and difference method under the normal model . in the absence of censoring , the proportion difference was identically zero for all sample sizes , thus confirming that in this setting the estimators are numerically identical as theory dictates .",
    "in the presence of censoring ( whether right or interval censoring ) , the difference between the estimators decreased as sample size increased .",
    "though not displayed in the figure , this trend continues and the proportion difference converges to zero with increasing sample size .",
    "figures 1b and 1c show that both the product and difference methods produced consistent estimators for the indirect effect .",
    "+ figure 2a shows the absolute proportion difference between the product and difference method under a weibull model . in the absence of censoring ,",
    "the proportion difference decreased as sample size increased but was still relatively large for small sample sizes . in the presence of right censoring ,",
    "the proportion difference between the estimators was very large and did not decrease with increasing sample size .",
    "figure 2b gives a summary of the proportion bias incurred by each estimator under the two censoring scenarios .",
    "for no censoring , both product and difference methods produced unbiased estimators of the indirect effect . under right censoring , the product method also produced an unbiased indirect effect estimator across all sample sizes .",
    "in contrast , the difference method under right censoring had a proportion bias of about @xmath55 , which does not appear to decrease with increasing sample size .",
    "the results from figure 2b reveal that under right censoring , the difference method failed to be consistent for the indirect effect , with significant bias regardless of sample size .",
    "when there was no censoring , the difference method produced a consistent estimator of the indirect effect , although , in small samples the difference between the estimators was substantial .",
    "+ in the above simulations , we only considered the indirect effect , but we can easily expand these results to the total effect .",
    "for the normal model scenario , the total effect estimator is consistent .",
    "thus , in both the absence or presence of censoring , the total effect can be estimated from the reduced form model ( @xmath34 estimator ) or by summation of direct and indirect effects estimators based on the product or difference method and the direct effect ( @xmath27 estimator ) .",
    "for the weibull model scenario , in the absence of censoring , the total effect can be estimated using either method , similar to the normal model scenario . in the presence of censoring",
    ", the total effect should only be estimated by the summation of the product method indirect effect estimator and the direct effect as the estimate of @xmath34 will be biased . + figure a1 in the appendix shows the monte carlo variances for each estimator discussed above .",
    "as expected , the variance of all estimators decreased towards zero as sample size increased .",
    "we considered a data application which combined two cohort studies of hiv - exposed persons : phacs and pactg 219c .",
    "the studies both followed perinatally hiv - exposed males and females upon entry into study and measured various outcomes . the outcome we evaluated was age at sexual maturity for males only , which was subject to both interval and right censoring .",
    "the outcome @xmath8 is adequately modeled as a normal outcome , and , therefore , we expect results for the normal model to apply .",
    "of the 1,380 males in the sample , 30% reached sexual maturity during follow - up and were subject to interval censoring ; the remaining 70% were right - censored .",
    "the exposure was binary perinatal hiv infection .",
    "the mediator was height age- and sex - adjusted z - score ( htz ) at first visit occurring at age seven or older . to adjust for confounding due to racial differences and differing medication trends , we adjusted for birth year and race .",
    "we fit a normal aft model as age at sexual maturity is known to follow an approximately normal distribution .",
    "we used r to fit the following models in order to estimate the direct , indirect , and total effects using both the product and difference method . note that r allows a  gaussian \" distributed outcome , so that we can write the model in terms of @xmath8 rather than @xmath56 , though the same model can be obtained by fitting @xmath56 as a log - normal model for @xmath57age ) : + @xmath58 @xmath59 @xmath60 where @xmath18 , @xmath17 , and @xmath61 are all normally distributed variables with mean zero and unknown variance .",
    ".normal aft mediation model effect estimates for age at sexual maturity by perinatal hiv status ( @xmath62 ) [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in table 2 , our estimates indicated a 2-fold increase in mean time to death or oi for adults starting combination arvs as compared to monotherapy , but 28% of this effect was mediated by decrease in viral load .",
    "the proportion difference between the two estimators was 12% .",
    "as previously discussed , we do not expect exact numerical equivalence . as well , even asymptotically , we expect the estimators to be different , with only the product method yielding a consistent estimator for the indirect effect .",
    "as shown in the appendix , the total effect estimator via the reduced form aft (  difference \" in table 2 ) will be biased , and the total effect (  product \" in table 2 ) is the valid estimate for the total effect .",
    "we have formally established that the reduced form aft model upon collapsing over the mediator is misspecified when the error distribution of the aft model is not collapsible upon marginalizing over the mediator . in the presence of censoring ,",
    "this misspecification cancan cause bias of the reduced form estimator of total effect , and therefore bias of the difference estimator of indirect effect . in the absence of censoring",
    ", the difference method yields a consistent estimator of the indirect effect .",
    "though , the model - based variance of the difference method is generally incorrect as the information matrix is derived from an incorrect likelihood . in theory",
    ", one could correct this by using the nonparametric bootstrap or the sandwich variance estimator for inference .",
    "+ the normal mediator - normal outcome model is an exception to the above phenomenon because the reduced form accelerated failure time model is correctly specified ; thus , the product and difference method are both consistent for the indirect effect and are numerically equivalent in the absence of censoring .",
    "crucially , consistency relies on the mediator following a normal distribution .",
    "if the mediator is not normally distributed , then the reduced form accelerated failure time model will be misspecified .",
    "however , in the absence of censoring , we have shown that this form of model misspecification does not compromise consistency of the estimator of the indirect effect with either the product or difference method .",
    "thus , the normality assumption of the mediator is only needed in the presence of censoring .",
    "+ the normal mediator - normal outcome simulation study confirmed these results as the product and difference methods yielded consistent estimators of the indirect effect regardless of censoring .",
    "in addition , the weibull simulation study confirmed that the difference method indirect effect estimators were biased and , thus , inconsistent in the presence of censoring , but consistent when there was no censoring .",
    "as shown in the appendix and our simulation results , under certain assumptions , the product method will always yield a consistent estimator of the indirect effect .",
    "thus , we caution users against employing the difference method for aft models , and generally recommend using the product method as it yields a consistent estimator of the indirect effect in any of the above scenarios . in addition",
