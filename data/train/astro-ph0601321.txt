    "the number of low mass dark matter halos predicted by models of a cdm dominated universe far exceeds the quantity of observed dwarf galaxies , typically by several orders of magnitude ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in this context we consider a galaxy to be a dark matter halo that contains baryons .",
    "consequently the slope of dark matter mass functions generally rises much more steeply than observed galaxy luminosity functions ( @xcite ; but see also @xcite ) .    while there are some physical processes that could help narrow this discrepancy @xcite , the theoretical low mass halo frequency is not reduced enough to reconcile them with observations .",
    "so we are left with the conclusions that either the current most favored cosmological models significantly over - estimate the number of low mass dark matter halos present in the local universe , or the observations have failed to find the vast majority of low mass galaxies to date . if the latter were true , then it is important to look at why dwarf galaxies could be missed and how we could detect them .",
    "two reasons why galaxies might not have been found yet in optical surveys are that they could exhibit low stellar densities ( @xmath1 1  @xmath4pc@xmath5 ) or most of their baryons are in invisible form . in the extreme case , they do not contain any baryonic matter at all and are in fact `` empty '' dark matter halos .",
    "these possibilities could be dark matter halos in which the star formation from accreted gas has been halted , suppressed , never began , or there were simply no baryons to form stars to begin with .",
    "such objects lacking stars might be considered as being `` dark galaxies , '' which could be easily missed in surveys biased towards optical wavelengths @xcite .",
    "however , dark galaxies have yet to be found in the blind hi surveys such as hipass @xcite .",
    "if they do exist , large numbers of low mass dark galaxies could naturally steepen the mass functions from observations , which are mostly derived from optical or near - infrared galaxy luminosity functions without consideration of other baryonic matter .",
    "recent large scale observations of neutral hydrogen gas ( hi ) are now allowing mass functions to be derived based on non - stellar properties .",
    "@xcite produced one of the most extensive hi mass functions based on a catalogue of the 1000 hi - brightest galaxies in the southern hemisphere and found a similar low mass end slope to other observational studies , again in contradiction with @xmath6cdm models .",
    "galaxies that have failed to convert most of their primordial gas into stars , and thus retained a high proportion of hi , may well provide a partial solution . while not entirely `` dark '' these galaxies are hard to detect optically , but may be detectable through 21 cm line observations . the hi mass - to - light ratio (",
    "@xmath2 , which compares the hi mass to the _ b _ band luminosity ) of these objects could be significantly higher than the typical ratios measured for late - type galaxies , so that they would be in a lower mass bin in a luminosity function than they would be for a baryonic mass function .",
    "if high @xmath2 galaxies existed in significant numbers then they could help correct the discrepancy in two ways , by including more previously unknown galaxies , and by shifting known galaxies to higher mass bins than they would be placed in with purely optical results .",
    "an example of an extreme hi mass - to - light ratio object , which could be described as a `` dim '' galaxy , is the nearby dwarf irregular eso215-g?009 with @xmath2 = @xmath7  @xmath0 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  i ) .",
    "this faint low surface brightness dwarf irregular was found to be spatially isolated ( 1.7  mpc from the nearest neighbor ) , with a low current star formation rate ( @xmath8  @xmath4yr@xmath9 ) .",
    "it has an extended regularly rotating hi disk , which can be traced out to over six times the holmberg radius of the optical galaxy , making it one of the most extended hi envelopes relative to the optical extent .",
    "paper  i included an analysis of the hi gas surface density of eso215-g?009 .",
    "the azimuthally averaged surface density at all radii was below the critical gas surface density needed for large scale star formation as defined by the @xcite stability criteria @xcite .",
    "it was proposed in @xcite that a large fraction of low mass halos may form @xcite stable gas disks and become `` dark '' galaxies , possibly 95% of objects with halo masses of @xmath10  @xmath4 . if so eso215-g?009 would be just the tip of the iceberg .",
    "if we can find more galaxies similar to eso215-g?009 , where the gas density after gravitational collapse is too low for efficient star formation , it may go some way to explaining the discrepancy between the dark matter halo mass function and the observed galaxy luminosity function .    to continue our study of the stellar and gas properties of galaxies with high @xmath2",

    "b _ band photometry and hi flux density it is also important to discuss the one contributor to @xmath2 that is beyond the scope of our observations , the dust extinction due to both our galaxy ( see table  [ tab : opt ] ) and the host galaxy ( `` internal '' extinction ) .",
    "as we noted in paper  i galactic extinction is particularly important for eso215-g?009 due to its sky position only 105 from the galactic plane .",
    "eso428-g033 at @xmath418 = -69 is the only other galaxy that is subject to similar galactic extinction ( @xmath79 = @xmath35  mag , sfd98 ) .",
    "the uncertainties in the sfd98 galactic extinction grow proportionally to the value .",
    "this means that it only contributes a significant fraction to the total error in @xmath2 for eso215-g?009 and eso428-g033 .",
    "close to the galactic plane the dust distribution can be patchy . fig .",
    "[ fig : schlegel ] shows the sfd98 dust extinction maps in terms of @xmath79 for the regions around eso428-g033 and eso215-g?009 , with the last hi contour from fig .",
    "[ fig : himap ] superimposed for reference .",
    "both maps show relatively low variation in the amount of extinction over the field around the galaxy , less than the uncertainty in @xmath79 in both cases .",
    "this suggests that the sfd98 value at the position of both galaxies is an accurate representation of the true galactic extinction .",
    "eso428-g033 was studied by @xcite as part of an investigation of galaxies in a region of the galactic plane with reduced dust extinction .",
    "their results are in agreement with our measurements , and in general they found that the properties of their sample objects were typical of other samples of nearby galaxies despite the relatively high extinction .",
    "it is worth noting that even if the galactic extinction was much higher at the position of eso215-g?009 , say by 0.5  mag , the galaxy would still have a very high @xmath2 of @xmath419  @xmath0 .    while we can at least get a relatively accurate estimate of galactic extinction , dust extinction internal to the host galaxy itself is much harder to quantify .",
    "dust extinction in late - type galaxies is poorly understood but thought to be lower than in early - type spirals due to low metalicity and ineffective dust accretion processes @xcite .",
    "we would expect a disk galaxy to have significant extinction when viewed close to edge on , like eso348-g009 ( @xmath420@xmath421 , see table  [ tab : rot ] ) , due to the geometry of the dust distribution .",
    "we discussed eso215-g?009 s possible internal extinction in paper  i , concluding that it is most likely low for this close to face on galaxy .",
    "the galaxy eso121-g020 may have a high inclination angle of @xmath422@xmath421 ( table  [ tab : rot ] ) , in contrast to the optical dimensions , and a moderate amount of internal extinction .",
    "the optical emission of the galaxy eso428-g033 is highly obscured by foreground stars .",
    "due to the current inability to estimate internal extinction we have not accounted for it in our @xmath2 calculations .      several common elements between the galaxies with the most extreme @xmath2 s are becoming more evident .",
    "the three best examples , eso215-g?009 ( @xmath7  @xmath0 , paper  i ) , ddo154 ( 9.4  @xmath0 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and ngc3741 ( 5.8  @xmath0 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , all have hi envelopes that are 5 to 8 times the optical holmberg radius , as ic4212 may also have .",
    "this may be because the gas is at a low density and is in a stable state , as was seen for eso215-g?009 in paper  i. all these galaxies also have low tidal indexes @xcite , indicating _ they are isolated in space _ and have little external stimulation to form stars . despite having very low stellar content for their dynamical masses , the baryonic masses of the galaxies are always of the order of @xmath423 of the total dynamical mass , which is a typical fraction seen in galaxies from @xmath424 to the dwarf regime @xcite .",
    "this suggests _ that high @xmath2 galaxies are not lacking the baryons to create stars , but are underluminous as they lack either the internal or external stimulation for further star formation_.    @xcite obtained spectra of hii regions within five sculptor group galaxies including two in our sample , eso473-g024 and eso348-g009 . for eso473-g024 ,",
    "for which we found a moderately high @xmath2 , they were able to produce oxygen and nitrogen abundances .",
    "the oxygen abundance indicated a low metalicity which is typical of other late type galaxies .",
    "normally dwarf galaxies with a similar low metalicity have low nitrogen to oxygen ratios in a narrow range around an average of @xmath425 @xcite .",
    "it is thought this is because these galaxies are undergoing their first burst of star formation , and that the nitrogen from this burst has not yet had time to dissipate into the ism ( coming from type ii supernovae of intermediate mass stars , while oxygen comes from higher mass stars , see * ? ? ?",
    "however , @xcite found that the n / o ratio for eso473-g024 was relatively high .",
    "most importantly for our study , they compared these results to a study of the high @xmath2 galaxy ddo154 by @xcite which shows the same trend for n / o . in both galaxies nitrogen from any past star formation events has had time to disperse and there is no current burst of star formation to reduce the n / o ratio , neither galaxy having a particularly high current star formation rate ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* respectively ) and like eso215-g?009 they may be considered quiescent galaxies .",
    "in fact , their current sfr and luminosity ( which can be used as a rough estimate of the average past star formation rate , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are similar to what was found for eso215-g?009 in paper  i. this suggests that _ high hi mass - to - light ratio galaxies may have been forming stars at a low , constant rate over their lifetimes . _ in order to understand further the significance of this result we would need to expand this study to spectra of hii regions in other high @xmath2 galaxies ( especially eso215-g?009 ) and look at other ratios which may indicate the timing of star formation events .",
    "metalicity may also be an important element in determining the fraction of baryons which remain in gas form @xcite .",
    "a close look at the plots of @xmath2 versus @xmath416 ( figs .  [ fig : mlmbt ] and [ fig : slidenine ] ) shows that there is potentially an upper envelope to a galaxy s hi mass - to - light ratio at a given luminosity .",
    "low luminosity galaxies appear to be able to have a higher portion of their detectable baryons in the form of neutral hydrogen than galaxies around @xmath424 , where the baryonic mass is dominated by stars even for the most gas rich galaxies .",
    "what this suggests is that _ there is a minimum quantity of stars a galaxy will form that goes as a function of initial baryonic mass_. support for this idea can also be found in the theoretical work of @xcite . whether or not a galaxy forms more than this minimum is likely to be a function of such factors as environment and the galaxy s dark matter properties .",
    "@xcite developed models to determine whether a neutral gas disk without stars ( a `` dark galaxy '' ) could remain dynamically stable or if some gas will collapse and form stars .",
    "they found that without an internal radiation field the majority of the gas in the disk will become gravothermally unstable , even for galaxies with very low baryonic masses ( down to @xmath426  @xmath4 ) .",
    "they also found that the fraction of unstable gas decreases as the baryonic mass decreases .",
    "this may provide an explanation to why we see the slope in the upper envelope for @xmath2 , the lower mass galaxies only having to convert a much smaller fraction of their baryons to stars in order to become stable .",
    "galaxies such as eso215-g?009 and ddo154 are close to our upper envelope , and may define the extreme cases of galaxies which have formed only the minimum number of star required in order to remain stable and have not experienced any other events which may trigger star formation . in this way",
    "they might be used to distinguish between various models for galaxy collapse by defining the minimum star formation required for stability .",
    "we will further explore this possibility , and other properties that vary with @xmath2 , with a larger sample of 37 late type dwarf galaxies in an upcoming paper .",
    "we obtained accurate optical ccd apparent magnitudes and hi flux densities for nine late type dwarf galaxies and recalculated their hi mass - to - light ratios .",
    "the new @xmath2 values are :    * @xmath7  @xmath0 for eso215-g?009 , * @xmath390  @xmath0 for eso572-g009 , * @xmath377  @xmath0 for eso428-g033 , * @xmath358  @xmath0 for mcg04 - 02 - 003 , * @xmath362  @xmath0 for eso473-g024 , * @xmath427  @xmath0 for ic4212 , * @xmath428  @xmath0 for eso348-g009 , * @xmath429  @xmath0 for eso121-g020 , and * @xmath430  @xmath0 for eso505-g007",
    ".    many of these hi mass - to - light ratios are significantly below the initial estimates , due to inaccurate magnitude estimates in the literature .",
    "this strongly emphasises the importance of having accurate observations in both the hi line and the optical .",
    "based on the new hi mass - to - light ratio distribution we conclude that genuine `` dim '' galaxies with high ratios ( @xmath2@xmath35  @xmath0 ) are rare in the local universe .",
    "a previously uncatalogued companion galaxy to eso121-g020 was found at a projected distance of 3 .",
    "atcaj061608574552 has an hi mass of @xmath431  @xmath4 and @xmath2 of @xmath373  @xmath0 .",
    "this was the only such companion detected , and is well within the beam of the multibeam instrument used by the hipass survey . despite our low resolution",
    "hi observations we were able to separate the galaxy eso505-g007 from its close neighbor eso505-g008 and determined hi flux densities of @xmath157 and @xmath175  jy  kms@xmath9 , respectively .",
    "the best examples of high @xmath2 dwarf galaxies in the literature all have highly extended hi disks , are spatially isolated and have normal baryonic content for their dynamical masses .",
    "the galaxies are not lacking the baryons to create stars , but are underluminous as they lack either the internal or external stimulation for further star formation .",
    "future examination of element abundances within star formation sites of high @xmath2 galaxies may reveal important clues about their star formation history .",
    "recent observations @xcite support the idea that high @xmath2 galaxies may have been forming stars at a low , constant rate over their lifetimes as proposed in paper  i. there may be a minimum quantity of stars a galaxy will form that depends on the initial baryonic mass , which is supported by the theoretical work of @xcite .",
    "if this is true then maybe high hi mass - to - light ratio galaxies have over their lifetimes only formed the minimum number of stars necessary to maintain the stability of their hi gas disk .",

    "we would like to thank erwin de blok for his help with various aspects of the hi data reduction and interpretation .",
    "we would also like to thank marilena salvo and gayandhi de silva for their observing assistance .",
