    "for the calibration of the response of an iact , two coefficients are relevant .",
    "the relation between light intensity ( in photons / m@xmath1 ) and the digitized telescope signal ( in adc channels ) provides an overall scale factor in estimates of shower energies .",
    "the signal per single photoelectron is needed in addition to obtain the actual number of photoelectrons in a given image , which determines the size of fluctuations around the mean response .",
    "scope of this paper is the determination of the first of these two coefficients ; methods to determine the second are discussed e.g. in @xcite .",
    "usually , the total intensity @xmath3 of a cherenkov image , given in units of adc channels , is used as a measure of the energy of a @xmath0-ray shower .",
    "the radial dependence of the intensity of the cherenkov light is taken into account by either selecting events with impact points within a certain limited distance range , or by explicit estimation of the impact distance and corresponding correction factors .",
    "let @xmath4 be the intensity ( photons of frequency @xmath5 per unit area ) the air shower would have generated at the location of the telescope without intermediate absorption or scattering in the atmosphere , and @xmath6 the atmospheric transmission ( which of course depends on the height distribution of photon emission ) .",
    "the magnitude @xmath3 of the image can then be written in terms of an iact response @xmath7 , @xmath8 the response @xmath9 includes the effective mirror area @xmath10 ( taking into account shadowing by the camera , the camera masts , etc . ) , the mirror reflectivity @xmath11 , the efficiency of light collection onto the pms ( e.g. with funnels etc . )",
    "@xmath12 , the quantum efficiency and photoelectron collection efficiency of the pm @xmath13 , the pm charge amplification @xmath14 , and the electronics gain and digitizer conversion factor @xmath15 : @xmath16 we assume here that the camera has been flat - fielded , such that a common calibration constant can be applied for all pmts of the camera ; the terms entering eq .  [ eq_eff ] then represent suitable averages .",
    "various techniques to calibrate iact response have been used or proposed .",
    "one can , e.g. , combine data - sheet specifications , educated guesses , and measurements for the individual factors entering @xmath9 .",
    "in particular , the crucial factor @xmath17 can be determined by either directly observing the single - photoelectron peak in the digitized spectrum ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , or by determining the mean number of photoelectrons generated by a test light pulse on the basis of the relative width of distribution of digitized signals , which is proportional to @xmath18 , modulo corrections for the width of the single - photoelectron peak , intensity fluctations of the test light pulse , and electronics and digitizer noise ; see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "a problem with this technique is that data - sheet specifications are not always reliable ( mirror reflectivity will e.g. deteriorate over time ) , and that measurements of the individual factors are non - trivial , so that the combined errors are quite significant ( see section 4 ) .",
    "other techniques aim at measuring either @xmath9 or @xmath19 directly .",
    "all these techniques determine a spectrum - averaged calibration constant :    * cosmic rays can be used to calibrate the overall response of the iact , including the leading effects of atmospheric transmission ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the small corrections in transmission between the ( deeper ) hadronic showers and @xmath0-ray showers are derived from monte - carlo studies . technically , one compares the mc - predicted cosmic - ray counting rate and the measured counting rate , and adjusts a global calibration factor @xmath20 such that the two agree ; for an integral spectral index @xmath21 , the detection rate varies approximately like @xmath22 .",
    "one drawback of this technique is that the predicted rates depend on the cosmic - ray flux and in particular on the composition @xcite , and uncertainties in these quantities propagate into the @xmath0-ray flux .",
    "another difficulty is that one has to rely on the proper modeling of hadronic showers , which involves larger uncertainties than in the case of electromagnetic showers .",
    "* cherenkov rings generated by local muons can be triggered and reconstructed by telescopes with sufficiently large mirror areas ; the light yield is then used to calibrate the response @xcite .",
    "one difficulty is that only the spectrum - weighted average response is measured , and that the spectrum of cherenkov light from nearby muons contains increased uv components compared to showers high up in the atmosphere .",
    "* starlight from stars selected to match the cherenkov spectrum and giving rise to a dc current in the pmts can be used for calibration @xcite .",
    "problems with this technique include the fact that the electronics signal path is usually quite different for the measurement of dc currents and for fast pulses , and that hence the relevant gain factors are not measured directly .",
    "the technique discussed in this paper aims at measuring @xmath7 directly , by generating from a distant , monochromatic , pulsed light source a known flux of photons at the telescope , which illuminates uniformly the entire mirror and which is captured and digitized like a genuine cherenkov light front .",
    "the key issue in the calibration of an iact with a distant pulsed light source is the determination of the light flux at the location of the telescope . for light pulses of ns - duration",
    ", no other detector can compete in sensitivity with cherenkov telescopes , and hence there is no immediately suitable reference detector .",
    "one option would be to calibrate the light source with a detector closer to the source , using the @xmath23 dependence of the light flux . in this case",
    ", however , atmospheric attenuation enters again .",
    "a more promising option is to make the light source strong enough that it can be detected by a calibrated sensor at the telescope , and then insert a calibrated attenuator for the measurements with the telescope itself .",
    "of course , care must be taken that the attenuator influences only the intensity , but no other properties of the beam such as , e.g. , its angular spread .",
    "this calibration procedure was tested using one of telescopes ( ct4 ) of the hegra iact system  @xcite , which is operated on the canary island of la palma , at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos of the instituto astrofisico de canarias .",
    "these telescopes use tesselated 8.5  m@xmath1 mirrors with 5  m focal length , and are equipped with 271-pixels camera with a field of view of @xmath24 .",
    "the cameras are read out by flash - adc digitizers .    as a calibration light source",
    ", we used as pulsed 337-nm nitrogen laser to excite a scintillator ( ne 111 ) , which re - emits at wavelengths above 350  nm .",
    "the pulse length generated by the laser was 0.5  ns .",
    "the roughly isotropic light from the scintillator was filtered through interference filters of 10  nm bandwidth . to attenuate the light output , attenuators ( neutral density filters )",
    "were inserted into the primary laser beam , prior to the scintillator .",
    "the attenuation was calibrated by monitoring the light output from the scintillator by a reference photodiode . attenuating the input pulse into the scintillator ( rather than its output ) should guarantee that the spatial distribution of the re - emitted beam is invariant .    as sensor at the telescope , a calibrated large - area ( about 1  cm@xmath1 ) , low - capacitance ( and hence low - noise ) photodiode was employed .",
    "coupled to a low - noise charge - sensitive preamplifier and a shaping amplifier , light pulses of less than 10000 photons can be detected , and their intensity measured to good precision by averaging over a larger number of pulses .",
    "the proper distance between light source and telescope deserves some attention . with a light source `` at infinity '' , the calibration light is imaged onto a small spot of a single pixel , resulting in two undesirable features : a ) one is very sensitive to local variations in photo efficiency , and b ) because of the limited dynamic range of a single pixel , the calibration light pulse should contain no more that a few 1000 photons incident on the mirror .",
    "the latter condition implies a flux of a few @xmath26 photons / cm@xmath1 . between the calibration measurement and the measurement with the telescope",
    ", the light source would have to be attenuated by a factor a few @xmath27 .",
    "such large factors are non - trivial to measure with the required precision of a few % .",
    "therefore , the light source was moved closer , to about 65  m from the telescope . in this position",
    ", the focal plane is behind the camera , but the image is still well contained within the camera . since the intensity is spread over o(100 ) pixels , one can use larger intensities , and the attenuation needed between the two measurements drops to a more manageable factor of @xmath28 to @xmath29 .",
    "the actual setup is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_setup](a ) for the mode ` a ' where the light intensity at the telescope was calibrated , and in fig .",
    "[ fig_setup](b ) for the mode ` b ' where the telescope signal was measured .",
    "the laser was contained in a light - tight box , which separate compartments for the attenuator ( in mode b ) , and for the scintillator and interference filter .",
    "the laser was pulsed at 4  hz .",
    "a photo diode in the laser compartment was used to pick up some stray laser light and to provide a trigger signal for the digitization of the other diode signals .",
    "the light intensity was monitored by a reference photo diode ( hamamatsu s 3590 - 06 ) mounted at a distance of 31  cm from the scintillator , close to ( but not in ) the beam to the telescope mirror . in mode",
    "a , this diode was coupled to a low - gain charge - sensitive preamplifier , in mode b a high - gain preamplifier was used , in each case together with a shaping amplifier with 3  @xmath30s shaping time .",
    "the signal of the calibrated photo diode at the telescope ( hamamatsu s 3590 - 06 ) is similarly amplified . at a depletion voltage of 28",
    "v , the capacitance of this diode is 50  pf , resulting in a rms noise of the system of 550 electrons at room temperature , and about 320 electrons under operating conditions , at a few deg .",
    "c , where in particular the leakage current of the diode is strongly reduced . in mode",
    "b , where the telescope is read out , the regular trigger system and data aquisition system of the telescope is used to capture the light pulse . during the calibration measurements ,",
    "the telescope will in addition occasionally trigger on noise or cosmic rays .",
    "such events are easily removed during the offline analysis .",
    "great care was taken to properly align all elements involved in the calibration , to eliminate stray light incident on the diodes by baffles , and to minimise electronics noise and pickup by proper grounding .",
    "electronics pedestals and gains were monitored regularly .",
    "calibration measurements were taken at two center wavelengths , 430  nm and 470  nm , during two measurement campaigns .",
    "based on the experience in the first campain , a number of sources of systematic errors were identified and corrected .",
    "we therefore use only the data from the second campaign .",
    "poor weather conditions allowed only three sets of calibration measurements , at 430  nm and at 470  nm in one night , and a second 430  nm measurement in another night . in between , the setup was partly disassembled , so the comparison of the two measurements at 430  nm serves to test the reproduceability of the procedure .",
    "one measurement typically included 1000 or more laser shots ; statistical errors are therefore generally small , and the precision of the calibration is entirely dominated by systematic effects . figs .",
    "[ fig_sensorsignal ] through [ fig_cameradist ] show characteristic data from various steps of the procedure : the signal of the calibrated sensor at the telescope in calibration mode a ( fig .",

    "the telescope sensitivity @xmath7 is derived in the following steps :    * using the photo diode calibration provided by the manufacturer , and the calibrated sensitivity of the charge amplification chain , the light flux in mode a is calculated from the averaged signal . * using the signals of the reference diode near the light source in modes a and b , and the calibrated gains of the low - gain and high - gain amplification chains , the attenuation factor between mode a and b and hence the flux at the telescope in mode b is calculated . * dividing the average iact signal in mode b ( in units of adc counts ) by the flux ,",
