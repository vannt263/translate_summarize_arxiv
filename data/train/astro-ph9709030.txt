    "stickel et al . (",
    "1996a ) have found that 15 sources are undetected on the palomar observatory sky survey ( poss ) plates .",
    "they designate these 1 jy , flat spectrum radio sources with faint optical counter - parts as ` red quasars ' .",
    "subsequent deep imaging in the optical and near ir by stickel et al .",
    "( 1996a ) shows that these red quasars typically have faint , extended , galaxy - like emission in the optical , with little or no evidence for a bright point source , while near ir images reveal a dominant point source in most cases .",
    "moreover , 13 of the 15 sources are variable in the near ir , indicating emission from an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , as opposed to a starburst .",
    "stickel et al .",
    "( 1996a ) consider two physical models for the red colors of these sources : an intrinsically red spectrum for the agn emission mechanism , perhaps due to a high energy cut - off in the relativistic electron population ( assuming the emission is synchrotron radiation ; bregman et al .",

    "radio selected quasar samples , such as the 1 jy , flat spectrum source sample , are important because they avoid possible biases introduced in optically selected quasar samples by dust obscuration along the line of sight .",
    "such obscuration may have a significant impact on the numbers of quasars seen at high redshift in optical samples , and on the number of high column density absorption line systems seen toward optically selected quasars ( heisler and ostriker 1988 , fall and pei 1993 , webster et al .",

    "these observations are intended to address a number of issues .",
    "first is the question of whether some agns have intrinsically red , rather than dust - reddened , emission spectra .",
    "the detection of a large column of neutral hydrogen would provide at least circumstantial evidence in favor of dust - reddening ( _ cf .",
    "_ carilli , perlman , and stocke 1992 ) .",
    "second is the question of the fraction of quasars missing from optical samples due to dust obscuration , as well as the fraction of missing high column density quasar absorption line systems . and third is to enlarge the sample of dusty , high column density absorption line systems in order to study the dense ism in galaxies at significant look - back times .",

    "one goal of this up - grade is to provide almost continuous frequency coverage from 250 mhz to 1420 mhz .",
    "this system offers a new window for studies of redshifted neutral hydrogen using an interferometer .",
    "interferometers offer significant advantages over single dishes when searching for faint , broad lines at low frequency , including the natural mitigation of terrestrial interference due to fringe rotation , more accurate continuum flux density determination , and more linear spectral baselines .",
    "we have used the uhf - high part of this system ( 750 mhz to 1000 mhz ) to search for redshifted hi 21 cm absorption toward sources from the stickel et al .",

    "the redshifts used in the search are taken from table 1 of stickel et al .",

    "the data were gain , phase , and bandpass calibrated using the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) at the national radio astronomy observatory in socorro , nm . the quasars 3c 286 , 3c 48 , and 3c 147 were observed for absolute flux calibration , according to the scale of baars et al .",

    "self - calibration on the target continuum sources was then employed for further refinement of the antenna - based phase solutions .",
    "the absolute gain calibration accuracy is about 10@xmath4 , as estimated by applying calibration from one standard calibrator to another .",
    "data were inspected for interference and other problems , and bad data were removed from the visibility data - set . in the case of 0202 + 149 , strong terrestrial interference ( tv channel 48 ) was present in the observing band close to the line frequency , precluding observation of this source by the wsrt .",
    "the calibrated and edited data were fourier transformed to produce images for each frequency channel , and these channel images were assembled into an image ` cube ' . the aips program ` imlin ' was then used to subtract the continuum emission in the field by fitting a linear baseline to off - line channels at each pixel in the image cube .",
    "the subsequent continuum - subtracted image cubes were then deconvolved using the clark clean algorithm as implemented in the aips task ` apcln ' ( clark 1980 ) . in each case",
    "the cleaning was terminated when residual components equaled twice the rms noise per channel .",
    "the gaussian restoring clean beams for each source are listed in the figure captions .",
    "radio spectra were then extracted at the position of the continuum source , and converted to optical depth using the continuum source flux density .",

    "the hi absorption line image shows no indication of extension of the absorption toward the east ( figure 2b ) , although the sensitivity is such that we can only set a 1@xmath19 limit of 0.25 to the optical depth toward the jet at a distance of 20@xmath15 east of the nucleus ( @xmath20 spectral rms noise ) .",
    "the absorption profile is fit reasonably well by a single gaussian component ( the dashed - line in the lower frame of figure 1 ) , whose parameters are listed in table 2 , although we can not preclude a profile composed of a few narrower , blended components .",

    "1990 ) , we estimate that the milli - arcsecond scale structure in 0108 + 388 contributes about 70@xmath4 to the total flux density at 851 mhz , and about 85@xmath4 to the peak surface brightness as seen by the wsrt at 851 mhz .",
    "further , the compact nucleus has an inverted spectrum such that the low frequency emission from the core - jet must be dominated by the jet ( baum et al .",

    "the remaining 7.5@xmath4 are unidentified on the poss ( the 15 ` red quasars ' ) , implying a magnitude limit of :   @xmath43 @xmath8 20 , or   @xmath33 @xmath35 @xmath36 .",

    "an upper limit to this fraction can be estimated by making the extreme assumption that all the red quasars and the galaxies in the sample are dust - obscured quasars .",
    "this leads to an upper limit to the fraction of missing quasars of :   @xmath45 = 20@xmath4 .",
    "fall and pei ( 1993 ) have presented detailed models of the numbers of quasars missing from optically selected samples due to obscuration by dust associated with high column density quasar absorption line systems as a function of redshift .",
    "the redshift distribution of the 1 jy , flat spectrum quasar sample shows a broad peak at z @xmath46 1 , with a tail to higher redshifts ( stickel , meisenheimer , and khr 1994 ) . using this redshift distribution",

    "the statistics of damped ly@xmath6 systems in optically selected samples implies a redshift distribution function of the form : n(z ) = 0.015 @xmath0 ( 1+z)@xmath47 , where n(z ) is the number of absorption systems with n(hi ) @xmath8 2@xmath010@xmath48 @xmath3 per unit redshift ( rao , turnshek , and briggs 1995 ) . combining this function with the redshift distribution of the stickel etal .",
    "quasar sample leads to an expected number of 17 high column density absorption systems toward their optically identified quasars ( ie . out of about 163 sources ) .",
    "again , assuming that the 80@xmath4 detection rate of hi 21 cm absorption toward the five red quasars studied herein applies to the red quasar sub - sample as a whole , leads to a lower limit to the fraction of high column density absorption systems missing from optically selected samples of :   @xmath49 = 40@xmath4 .",

    "flat spectrum source sample have high column density absorption systems .",
    "the comparative numbers from the models of fall and pei ( 1993 ) are between 30@xmath4 and 60@xmath4 ( see also fall and pei 1995 ) .",
    "we should emphasize that there are a number of significant uncertainties in the statistics presented above .",
    "first is simply the small number of red quasars searched thus far for redshifted hi 21 cm absorption .",
    "second are the possible biases introduced by the fact that , due to practical observational limitations , our absorption searches were limited to the specific redshifts of the parent galaxies of the absorbing clouds , as determined from emission lines seen in deep optical spectra ( stickel etal .",
    "it is possible that we have under - estimated the number of high column density systems by not searching over the full redshift range in each case ( _ eg .",
    "_ absorption systems associated with dwarf galaxies might be missed ) .",
    "conversely , this selection criterion might skew the results toward absorbers at the redshift of the quasar host galaxy ( see section 4.3 ) , which perhaps could bias the statistics in the opposite sense . and third is the fact that the fairly high radio flux density limit of the 1 jy sample biases the sample toward lower redshift quasars : the redshift distribution of the 1 jy quasar sample peaks at z @xmath46 1 , while quasar samples derived from radio surveys with lower flux density limits peak at z @xmath46 2 , close to the redshift peak found for optically selected quasar samples ( shaver et al .",
    "1996 , hewitt and burbidge 1987 ) .",
    "while the redshift distribution is used explicitly in the calculations above , unbiased searches for redshifted hi 21 cm absorption toward a sample of red quasars selected from fainter radio catalogs would make for a fairer comparison with the optical data .",
    "overall , the statistics presented above should not be considered rigorous , but only representative .",
    "still , the red quasar data support the basic conclusions of fall and pei ( 1993 ) : ( i ) there may be a significant , but not dominant , population of quasars missing from optically selected samples due to obscuration , perhaps as high as 20@xmath4 at the poss limit for an optical sample with a redshift distribution similar to the 1 jy , flat spectrum quasar sample , and ( ii ) optically selected samples may miss about half the high column density quasar absorption line systems . a final point made by fall and pei",
    "is that the strongest bias in optical samples may be against the high column density systems with high metalicities and dust - to - gas ratios .",
    "such systems might be the most interesting from the perspective of follow - up radio studies of the dense , pre - star forming ism in galaxies at significant look - back times .",
    "the data presented herein suggests that searching for redshifted hi 21 cm absorption toward red quasars may be an effective method for circumventing this bias .      in some sources in our study",
    "the absorption , and presumably the reddening , is due to material in the quasar s host galaxy , as appears to be the case for 1504 + 377 at z = 0.673 ( carilli et al .",
    "1997 , wiklind and combes 1996a ) , and for 0108 + 388 at z = 0.6685 . in 1504",
    "+ 377 and 0108 + 377 the velocity widths for the absorption systems are large ( @xmath46100 km s@xmath18 ) , and hence comparable to line widths seen for systems associated with nearby seyfert galaxies and other low redshift agn ( dickey 1983 , van gorkom et al .",
    "1989 , conway and blanco 1995 ) .",
    "high resolution imaging of the absorption toward a number of nearby agn indicates that the high velocity dispersion gas is local to the agn , perhaps in a circumnuclear torus or ring with size scale of order 10 pc , and that the velocity width reflects the torus dynamics ( israel et al .",
    "1991 , gallimore et al .",
    "1994 , mundell et al .",
    "1995a , mundell et al .",
    "1995b , conway 1997 ) .    in other red quasars",
    "the absorption is due to material in galaxies cosmologically distributed along the line of sight to the quasar .",
    "one such intervening system is the gravitational lens 0218 + 357 , the smallest `` einstein ring '' radio source , for which hi 21 cm and molecular absorption has been detected toward the radio source at z = 0.687 ( carilli , et al .",
    "1993 , wiklind and combes 1995 , menten and reid 1996 ) .",
    "in retrospect , gravitational lensing may not be surprising for such systems , since one requires a low impact - parameter line of sight in order to intercept the denser regions of the ism of the intervening galaxy .",
    "an important conclusion is that at least some gravitational lenses are gas rich systems , as has also been found in the case of the einstein ring radio source pks 1830 - 211 ( wiklind and combes 1996b , frye , welch , and broadhurst 1997 , menten , carilli , and reid 1997 ) .    the case for a cosmologically intervening absorption system versus an associated system for 0500 + 019 is unclear ( see section 3.2 ) .",
    "a possible argument against the intervening hypothesis for 0500 + 019 is the broad hi 21 cm absorption line profile ( total velocity width = 140 km s@xmath18 ) .",
    "this is much larger than the 10 km s@xmath18 to 20 km s@xmath18 velocity dispersion expected for a line - of - sight perpendicular to the disk of a spiral galaxy ( dickey and lockman 1989 ) , and might argue for absorption by circumnuclear gas , as discussed above .",
    "an additional puzzle for this system is that the hi redshift is offset from the optical redshift by + 240@xmath31265 km s@xmath18 ( i.e. , in - falling relative to the optical galaxy ) , although the uncertainty in the optical redshift is large . if the absorber is an intervening system , a possible model to explain both the large velocity offset and the large velocity dispersion may be galactic rotation , in the case where the quasar projects off - center along the major axis of a highly inclined disk galaxy .",
    "for example , if the galaxy rotation velocity was 200 km sec@xmath18 , and the line - of - sight to the quasar cut through the edge - on disk halfway out along the major axis , the expected line width due to differential rotation would be about 100 km s@xmath18 .",
    "one possible difficulty with this model is that hi 21 cm absorption seen through the disk of the milky way galaxy typically appears as a series of discrete , narrow components with widths of a few km s@xmath18 ( dickey et al .",
    "unfortunately , the sensitivity of the current wsrt spectrum of 0500 + 019 is insufficient to differentiate between a blend of narrow components , or two broad , shallow lines .",
