    "the unexpected peak in the invariant mass of the @xmath2 system found in @xcite in the @xmath3 reaction at energies around @xmath4 was an interesting surprise which gives support to the theory of two @xmath5 states @xcite as was discussed in @xcite . in this paper",
    "it was found that for kaons in flight the single scattering peak and the double scattering were well separated , such that the double scattering showed a clear peak due to the excitation of the @xmath5 .",
    "the process can only occur in nuclei .",
    "indeed , the single scattering @xmath6 occurs for invariant masses above the @xmath7 threshold and does not show the resonance shape of the @xmath5 since this one occurs below threshold .",
    "however , in the deuteron , the initial kaon can collide with the neutron , give energy to this neutron , hence losing energy such that in a rescattering with the proton it can produce the @xmath5 . since the production is done with a proton , one predicts that the @xmath5 produced is the one that appears at energies around @xmath8 mev and narrow in the theoretical framework of @xcite , which is also supported by all chiral dynamical works on the issue ( see @xcite for a recent update ) .",
    "the work of @xcite was extended in @xcite to study the @xmath5 production at the lower energies of dafne , where the experiment was still predicted to be successful if forward neutrons in coincidence were measured .",
    "based on the experimental observation and the calculations of @xcite , a proposal has been done at j - parc @xcite looking for neutrons in the forward direction .    in between , two more theoretical papers on the issue have appeared with different results @xcite .",
    "the first one uses a three body approach for the final state , in the line of faddeev equations but truncated to second order .",
    "the authors claim that the peak observed corresponds to a threshold effect .",
    "the second one considers full faddeev equations for the final three particles but only shapes and not absolute cross sections are presented . in this latter case",
    "it is also suggested to divide the cross section by a predicted background in order to visualize better the signal of the resonance that in the calculation shows up clearly .    in the present work we present two studies based on the watson expansion and faddeev equations , truncated to second order , and we observe that the watson expansion is more realistic than the truncated faddeev approach , since it considers the potential energy of the nucleons in the deuteron , which is neglected in @xcite .",
    "we show that the watson expansion is equivalent to the one used in @xcite , thus reconfirming the results of that work .",
    "in addition we make predictions for forward neutrons , apart from the angle integrated cross sections , which should be useful in the planning of the j - parc experiment .",
    "[ fig1],width=245 ]    we consider the @xmath9 reaction , in which the @xmath5 resonance is produced by the @xmath10 channel in the intermediate state and decays to @xmath11 being observed in the final state ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) . because the @xmath5 is located below the threshold of @xmath10 , in order to create the @xmath5 by the @xmath10 channel one needs nuclear targets .",
    "here we take a deuteron target , which is the simplest nucleus . in this reaction , since the strangeness is brought into the system by the incident kaon from the outside and the flow of the strangeness is traceable , one can confirm that the @xmath5 resonance is produced selectively by the @xmath10 channel .",
    "this is an advantage of the kaonic production over photo and pionic production in which the strangeness should be created inside of the system and the @xmath5 can be produced by both @xmath10 and @xmath2 channels .",

    "in fact , it has turned out that these double scattering processes dominate the @xmath5 production for in - flight kaons because the energetic incident kaons can lose the energy by kicking out one of the nucleons and create the @xmath5 below the @xmath10 threshold .",
    "the transition amplitudes were calculated in ref .  @xcite as @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are the two - body scattering amplitudes of @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , respectively , and the energies @xmath27 and @xmath28 are given by @xmath29 the minus sign appearing in eq .",

    "especially , in our approximation the double scattering terms are calculated with eq .",

    "the double scattering contribution in the faddeev approach contains only the middle diagram , while the double scattering in the watson formulation have both middle and right diagrams.[fig : watfad],scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "in the previous section we have discussed two approaches to describe the @xmath90 reaction from the viewpoint of a three - body dynamical problem .",
    "one is the watson approach and the other is the faddeev approach .",
    "they are equivalent to each other if one takes into account all orders of the multiple scatterings , but they are different from each other if one truncates the multiple scatterings at some finite order .",
    "especially the double scattering process in the watson approach has more terms than that in the faddeev approach .",
    "generally , each term of the multiple scattering expansion has different contributions in both approaches , but in practice it could give very similar contributions in some systems with certain kinematical conditions .    in this section ,",
    "we compare the double scattering terms obtained by the faddeev and watson approaches by taking the @xmath91 reaction as an example . in the present study",
    "we employ the chiral unitary approach to evaluate the two - body meson - baryon dynamics and use physical masses for ground - state hadrons , which slightly breaks the isospin symmetry .",
    "we consider scattering amplitudes for the @xmath92 reaction up to the double scattering terms both in the watson and faddeev approaches .",
    "an important difference in the two approaches is the treatment of the green s function in the intermediate states .",
    "the single scattering term in our approximation is exactly the same as that obtained in the faddeev formulation .    in the watson approach",
    "one uses the green s function for the deuteron @xmath49 in the intermediate states , therefore in the watson approach the energy of the exchanged kaon in the double scattering are expressed as , @xmath93 to which we refer as case a. this is the exchanged kaon energy in double scattering which has been used in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in contrast , in the faddeev approach one uses the free green s function @xmath81 in the intermediate state , hence the on - shell nucleons , which go for the second scattering , can appear in the intermediate state in the double scattering . in the case for the double scattering ,",
    "we have the expression for @xmath27 ( case b ) as , @xmath94 this is the exchanged kaon energy in double scattering which the authors in ref .",
    "@xcite have used .",
    "the difference of two expressions for the exchanged kaon energy @xmath27 can be interpreted as how to implement the binding effect on two nucleons in a deuteron .",
    "namely , in the watson approach the potential between proton and neutron is taken into account and hence the secondary scattering nucleon in the intermediate state keeps off - shell in the double scattering .",
    "equation   can be understood so that the kinetic energy of the secondary scattering nucleon is cancelled almost by the potential energy owing to the small binding energy .",
    "in contrast , in the faddeev approach the effect of the bound nucleons is not considered and the secondary scattering nucleon in the intermediate state goes on - shell , meaning that the potential energy is neglected in the double scattering and the binding of nucleons would be accounted separately in other terms of the multiple scattering expansion .",

[ fig2 ] and eqs .   and",

    "first of all , we consider the differential cross section for the center - of - mass neutron scattering angle @xmath100 , on which the authors in ref .  @xcite concentrated . here , in order to see the structure created by the underlying kinematical features of the amplitudes rather than by the shape of the @xmath101 , we take the @xmath96 scattering amplitude appearing in the second scatterings as , @xmath102 the result of the differential cross section coming from diagram 2 of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for the @xmath103 reaction with a constant @xmath96 amplitude is plotted in fig .",

    "the initial kaon momentum @xmath104 is fixed as @xmath97 and @xmath98 . from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we find a cusp structure in both cases of a and b. the cusp structure comes from the three - body unitarity cut for the intermediate @xmath39 system as pointed out in ref",
    ".  @xcite .",
    "it is important noting that the cusp position depends on the prescription of the intermediate kaon energy , @xmath105 or @xmath106 .",
    "while the cross section rapidly rises around @xmath107 in case b with initial kaon momentum @xmath108 , this effect becomes moderate in case a with the same @xmath109 .",
    "bearing in mind that the watson approach contains more terms compared to the faddeev approach up to the double scattering , we expect that , even if the cusp from the three - body unitary cut appears in the cross section , it will be more moderate than predicted in ref .  @xcite .",
    "this moderation can be interpreted to be caused by the fact that a more accurate energy sharing of two bound nucleons in the deuteron is accomplished with the nonperturbative green s function for the deuteron .    from the results of the initial kaon momentum @xmath110 with constant @xmath111 amplitude",
    ", we see that more moderate cusp structures are obtained for higher initial kaon momentum , and the position shifts to lower energies for higher momentum .",
    "we have also checked the angle @xmath112 dependence for the cusps and have found that the cusp position moves to lower energies , which will be important when we integrate the angle to obtain the mass spectrum for the @xmath113 .     of the reaction",

    "we take two initial kaon momenta , @xmath97 and @xmath98 , and consider two intermediate kaon energy @xmath27 [ a   and b  ] coming from the watson and faddeev approaches , respectively .",

    "the results are plotted fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] for the initial kaon momenta of @xmath117 and @xmath98 .",
    "the reason that we have two cusps in each line is that these come from the unitary cuts of the @xmath118 and @xmath39 intermediate states of diagram 2 and 3 , respectively . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we see that the @xmath113 peak appears in case a in both momentum cases . in spite of the cusps coming from the unitary cuts in @xmath119 at around @xmath120 , in case a this does not spoil the @xmath113 spectrum .",
    "the cusps in the differential cross section become moderate in the higher momentum , as expected from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . in case b ,",
    "on the other hand , the rapid rise plotted in fig .  [ fig3 ] around @xmath121 would spoil the @xmath101 peak in the differential cross section .",

    "[ fig3 ] and hence the spoiled @xmath113 structure in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] originate from the use of the free green s function in the intermediate state .",
    "therefore , by taking more terms as the watson approach does , one can obtain the @xmath113 peak in the differential cross section .",
    "note , however , that even if the shape of the @xmath101 is not well reproduced in case b , the presence of the resonance has had an effect on the peaks , shifting the strength of fig .",

    "[ fig5],width=325 ]    up to now we have considered only the limited forward angle of the emitted neutron @xmath126 . this is not realistic , because in actual experiments one will observe the neutron in finite angles . let us see the finite angle contribution .",
    "we calculate the invariant mass spectra by integrating the angular dependence .",
    "since we are especially interested in the forward scattering with small @xmath127 , where the @xmath113 production will be large due to the double scattering processes  @xcite , we plot in fig .",

    "we also show the result for case b , which indicates that in the faddeev approach up to the double scattering the cusps depend slightly on the scattering angle .     of the reaction @xmath123 integrated for the whole neutron scattering angle . here",
    "we take two initial kaon momenta , @xmath97 and @xmath98 , and consider two intermediate kaon energy @xmath27 [ a   and b  ] coming from the watson and faddeev approaches , respectively .",
    "[ fig6],width=325 ]    finally we show the invariant mass spectrum integrated for the whole angle in fig .  [ fig6 ] . in this case",
    "the cusp structures for case a having appeared in previous figures completely disappear due to the angular dependence for the three - body unitary cut , and we observe the @xmath113 peak structure also in case b.    with respect to the paper of @xcite a few comments are in order .",
    "the input to construct the two body amplitudes is taken from @xcite , where an energy independent separable potential is used .",
    "this neglects the important energy dependence in the interaction provided by chiral theories . in any case , in the paper",
    "it is unclear how the initial state @xmath135 is produced and how does it couple to the final state",
    ". it would be important to clarify this in view of our arguments that the potential energy of the nucleons of the deuteron plays a role in the energy denominators that appear in the final formulas .",
    "the paper adds a new interesting observation , realizing that the kinematic peaks appear because of threshold of the reaction , and then suggest to divide the cross section by another one that has only background and no dynamical amplitudes .",
    "it is shown there that after division by this new spectra the cross sections reflects the properties of the resonance clearly .",
    "there is only one problem to it .",
    "this procedure is model dependent . within a certain model",
    "the kinematical spikes disappear with this procedure , but the spikes depend on the model that one is using .",
    "if one wishes to apply the method to a given experimental spectrum one is forced to choose some model and the procedure is bound to create model dependent spikes rather than eliminate them .",
    "hence , the method is not advisable for an experimental analysis .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed the @xmath3 reaction for kaons in flight , looking for the cross section for forward neutron angles for which a proposal is prepared for j - parc . at the same time",
    "we take advantage to introduce two new papers on the issue recently done and discuss the meaning of their approach to the light of two expansions , the watson expansion of multiple scattering and the truncated faddeev approach .",
    "we realized that in the truncated faddeev approach the potential energy of the nucleons in the deuteron is neglected .",
    "on the other hand , the watson approach of multiple scattering , which was used in @xcite , takes into account this information and represents a more suitable approach to the problem . because in the faddeev formalism the three particles are treated democratically , it is insufficient to consider only the kaon double scattering contributions , in which nucleon - nucleon interactions are not taken into account",
    ". thus , when one considers a bound particle of two particles in the initial state in the faddeev approach , one must consider contributions beyond the kaon double scattering contributions in order to take into account the @xmath136 interaction properly . in the watson formulation ,",
    "the bound particle is treated separately , and thus one has an efficient multiple scattering expansion scheme .",
    "in any case we also showed that the peak observed in @xcite , related there to threshold effects , is actually determined by the excitation of the @xmath5 but somewhat distorted .",
    "this we could see by changing the input and removing the @xmath5 in the amplitudes that we use , and then we realize a substantial shift of the peak in all the approaches .",
    "we also observe that in all approaches , when the neutron angle is integrated , the threshold peaks are washed away and a clear signal of the @xmath5 resonance shows up , though in the watson approach the curves are smoother and the predictions are deemed more accurate .",

    "<S> we argue that the watson approach is more suitable to study the reaction because it takes into account the potential energy of the nucleons forming the deuteron , which is neglected in the truncated faddeev approach . </S>",
    "<S> predictions for the experiment are done as well as spectra with the integrated neutron angle . </S>"
