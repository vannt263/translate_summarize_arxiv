    "in modern portfolio theory , risk diversification is the most essential issue , which involves the understanding of clustering behavior and risk contagion of the assets in a portfolio .",
    "thus , in a stock market , the price fluctuate of a listed company s asset ( i.e. , stock ) is parallel to others or interactively influenced by others .",
    "the widely used cross - correlation analysis is an important measurement to investigate the interactive relationships between pairs of stocks for understanding the dynamic mechanics in complex economic system .",
    "for example , the random matrix theory ( rmt ) suggests the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors of the cross - correlation matrix of price fluctuations are relevant to clustering behavior and economic sector division ( or taxonomy ) of stocks @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , with the development of complex network theory , diverse cross - correlation based stock networks are proposed to describe the interactive relationship , such as minimum spanning tree ( mst )  @xcite , planar maximally filtered graph ( pmfg )  @xcite , and threshold networks ( tn )  @xcite , etc .",
    "especially , the clustering behavior of stocks can be well associated with the communities scratched from these stock networks via complex network measurement .    in order to evaluate risk contagion , a lot of works",
    "have been devoted to analyze the influence relationships from directed network perspective .",
    "@xcite introduced the measurement of partial correlation to construct tn and pmfg of listed companies and uncover the dominating ones in a stock market .",
    "the engle - granger method  @xcite is an alterative way to obtain the asymmetric influences ( i.e , granger causality ) among listed companies .",
    "for example , yang _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite constructed directed cointegration network of global stock markets based on engle - granger cointegration test , and presented ranking analysis of nodes to distinguish their importance . besides , time - dependent cross - correlation @xcite is also applied to determine the linking direction between a pair of listed companies due to the time shift of maximum correlation .",
    "if the time shift is non - zero , thepulling \" effect is assumed to exist in these listed companies .    as an important emerging market ,",
    "the chinese stock market possesses unique properties , such as stronger cross - correlations and less market efficiency @xcite .",
    "there are few works involved the unidirectional influence relationship @xcite .",
    "however , these results are obtained based on daily stock returns , thus may be debatable under the consideration of efficient market . in this paper , we mainly focus on the risk contagion in chinese stock market , by constructing a directed influence network on the basis of time series of minute - by - minute price fluctuations with the time - dependent cross - correlation method , which is well behaved in american stock market@xcite . unlike previous literatures",
    ", we analyzed not only the global topological structure , but also the subnetworks of a few significant economic sectors in aim to explore the unique economic structure of china .",
    "empirical results reveal three types of connectivity involving with the intra - sector s influence relationship .",
    "we also compare several measurements of node s centrality to find out available characterization of the importance of listed companies in this influence network .",
    "the findings provide intriguing information about the topological properties of chinese stock market and give important hint about risk contagion in portfolio management ."

    "<S> in a stock market , the price fluctuations are interactive , that is , one listed company can influence others . in this paper , we seek to study the influence relationships among listed companies by constructing a directed network on the basis of chinese stock market . </S>",
    "<S> this influence network shows distinct topological properties , particularly , a few large companies that can lead the tendency of stock market are recognized . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , by analyzing the subnetworks of listed companies distributed in several significant economic sectors , it is found that the influence relationships are totally different from one economic sector to another , of which three types of connectivity as well as hub - like listed companies are identified . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the rankings of listed companies obtained from the centrality metrics of influence network are compared with that according to the assets , which gives inspiration to uncover and understand the importance of listed companies in the stock market . </S>",
    "<S> these empirical results are meaningful in providing these topological properties of chinese stock market and economic sectors as well as revealing the interactively influence relationships among listed companies . </S>"
