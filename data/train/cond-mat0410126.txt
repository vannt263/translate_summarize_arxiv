    "there is a large interest in many branches of current science in the topic of localization and energy transfer in hamiltonian nonlinear lattice systems ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite for a comprehensive review , and refs .",
    "@xcite for more recent progress ) . under quite general conditions ,",
    "such lattices sustain exact , spatially exponentially localized and time - periodic , solutions termed intrinsically localized modes ( ilms ) or discrete breathers ( dbs ) . although their existence as exact solutions has been rigorously proven in many explicit cases ( @xcite , and e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein for extensions ) , there is still an ongoing debate regarding their relevance to actual physical phenomena , at nonzero temperatures .",
    "important fundamental questions concern whether ilms may exist in thermal equilibrium , or if not , whether their typical lifetimes are long enough to considerably influence transport properties of crystals , biomolecules , etc .    a frequently studied example of a non - integrable hamiltonian lattice model is the discrete nonlinear schrdinger ( dnls ) equation ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for recent reviews of its history , properties and applications ) .",
    "this model is of great interest from a general nonlinear dynamics point of view , where it provides a particularly simple system to analyze fundamental phenomena such as energy localization , wave instabilities etc .",
    ", resulting from competition of nonlinearity and discreteness , as well as from a more applied viewpoint describing e.g.  arrays of nonlinear optical waveguides or bose - einstein condensates in external periodic potentials . the dnls equation can be derived through an expansion on multiple time - scales of small - amplitude oscillations in a generic class of weakly coupled anharmonic oscillators [ klein - gordon ( kg ) lattice ] , and thus approximates the kg dynamics over large but finite time - ranges ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "a particular feature of the dnls model is the existence of a second conserved quantity in addition to the hamiltonian : the total excitation number ( norm ) of the solution . in the kg model",
    ", this quantity roughly corresponds to the total action integral , which thus must be an approximate invariant in cases where the dnls description of the kg dynamics is acceptable .",
    "a fundamental question is , for which kinds of spatially _ extended _ initial states may we expect spontaneous formation of _ persistent localized modes _ in such lattices ?",
    "the answer generally requires a statistical - mechanics description of the model . due to the existence of a second conserved quantity , it has been possible to obtain some analytical results for the thermodynamic properties of the dnls model in the grand - canonical ensemble , by identifying the norm with the number of particles in the standard gibbsian approach (",
    "this is also its physically relevant interpretation in the bose - einstein dnls realization ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was found that the onset of persistent localization could be identified with a phase transition line in parameter space , such that on one side the system thermalized according to the gibbsian distribution with well - defined chemical potential and ( positive ) temperature , while on the other side the dynamics was associated with a negative - temperature behavior ( for finite systems ) creating a small number of large - amplitude , standing localized breathers .",
    "the transition line was shown to correspond to the limit of infinite temperatures in the normal regime .",
    "similar properties were later found also for other types of lattice models with two conserved quantities in ref .",
    "most recently , in ref .",
    "@xcite rumpf revisited the statistical - mechanics description of the dnls localization transition . under the particular assumption of small - amplitude initial conditions ( an assumption not made in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , he argues that the phase space generally can be divided into two weakly interacting domains , corresponding to low - amplitude fluctuations ( phonons ) and high - amplitude peaks ( breathers ) , respectively .",
    "explicit expressions for macroscopic quantities , valid not only in the normal regime but in the full range of parameter space , can then be obtained by assuming the two domains to be in thermal equilibrium with each other , and the emergence of localized peaks in the anomalous phase arises as the system strives for maximizing its total entropy . under these conditions ,",
    "the temperature is not negative but infinite in the thermal equilibrium state with coexisting large - amplitude breathers and small - amplitude fluctuations .",
    "let us mention a number of reasons that have lead us to revisit and extend the results of ref .",
    "first , so far only the one - dimensional ( 1d ) case with cubic nonlinearity was considered",
    ". however , apart from the natural interest in considering two- and three - dimensional ( 2d and 3d ) physical situations , there is also a fundamental difference to the 1d case : there is an _ excitation threshold _ for creation of localized excitations for the cubic dnls model @xcite .",
    "a similar threshold also occurs in the 1d dnls equation for noncubic nonlinearities of the form @xmath0 with @xmath1 @xcite , and generally the condition @xmath2 for existence of an excitation threshold in @xmath3 dimensions is the same as the condition for collapse of the ground - state solution of the corresponding _ continuous _ nls equation ( e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for this reason ,",
    "one sometimes studies the 1d dnls equation with larger @xmath4 hoping to capture the main effects of higher dimensionality in a simpler 1d model ( e.g.  refs .",
    "recently @xcite , similar arguments were also used in the study of a 1d kg chain with a @xmath5 on - site potential , to mimic the effects of an excitation threshold for breathers in the thermalization dynamics of a three - dimensional kg - lattice .",
    "( a similar relation between degree of nonlinearity and dimension is valid also for kg - lattices , see ref .",
    "@xcite , and ref .",
    "@xcite for recent extensions . )",
    "thus , it is of interest to investigate the nature of the statistical localization transition for various degrees of nonlinearity and dimensions , in order to elucidate ( i ) whether it is qualitatively affected by the existence of a breather excitation threshold , and ( ii ) whether quantitative effects arising from increasing @xmath4 agree with those from increasing @xmath3 .",
    "while the above connection motivates the study of particular on - site nonlinearities with @xmath6 and @xmath7 , recent progress in studies of bose - einstein condensates in optical lattices also provide motivation for considering non - integer values of @xmath8 .",
    "it has namely been suggested @xcite , that the effective power of the nonlinearity in the tight - binding dnls approximation depends on the effective dimensionality @xmath9 of the condensate in each well , such that @xmath10 where @xmath11 , or 3 .",
    "moreover , it is tempting to suggest a connection between the statistical localization transition in the dnls model and experimentally observed superfluid - insulator transitions of the condensate ( e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "last , but not least , we wish to employ the results for the dnls model to give quantitative predictions for breather formation in generic kg models , and in particular describe what kinds of initial conditions yield long - lived breathers in the regime of weak coupling and small averaged energy density where the dnls approximation is justified .",
    "although particular examples of the manifestation of the dnls localization transition in kg models have been given earlier @xcite , we here derive explicit general approximate expressions for the transition line in terms of direct properties of the kg initial state . due to the violation of norm ( or action ) conservation , the transition in the kg model is not strict , and we perform numerical simulations to investigate how the long - time dynamics is influenced by the slow variation of the almost conserved quantity .",
    "we suggest that the approach proposed here could be used to clarify the findings regarding the role of breathers in thermalized kg lattices ( with or without energy gaps ) of refs .",
    "@xcite , which did not employ the connection to the dnls model .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "[ sec : dnls ] describes the statistical mechanics of general dnls models .",
    "[ sec : dnls1d ] generalizes the statistical - mechanics approach of ref .",
    "@xcite to 1d models with general degrees of nonlinearity .",
    "as particular examples , we consider initial conditions taken as traveling ( sec .",
    "[ travel ] ) and standing ( sec .",
    "[ standing ] ) waves .",
    "we obtain simple analytical conditions for the transition into the statistical localization regime , and illustrate with numerical simulations the actual dynamics on both sides of the transition .",
    "[ sec : dnls2d ] extends these results to higher dimensions . in sec .  [",
    "sec : kg ] we describe how the results from the dnls model can be transfered into approximate conditions for statistical formation of long - lived breathers in weakly coupled klein - gordon chains , and confirm and illuminate these predictions with numerical simulations .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] gives some concluding remarks and perspectives .",
    "generalizing the 1d dnls equation of ref .  @xcite to include a nonlinearity of arbitrary ( homogeneous ) degree , we consider the dnls equation in the form : @xmath12 with the two conserved quantities hamiltonian @xmath13 $ ] , and norm ( excitation number ) @xmath14 .",
    "compared to eq .",
    "( 1 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite , we have used @xmath15 as the coefficient of the nonlinear term , included a coupling constant @xmath16 in front of the coupling terms , and generalized @xmath17 to @xmath18 with @xmath19 .",
    "note that although we formally discuss the case of positive intersite coupling and positive nonlinearity , this is not a restriction , since changing the sign of @xmath20 is equivalent to the transformation @xmath21 , while the same transformation followed by a time reversal @xmath22 is equivalent to changing the sign of the nonlinearity .",
    "thus , all obtained results can be directly transformed to the cases of negative coupling and/or negative nonlinearity . any finite coefficient in front of the nonlinear term",

    "notice also that @xmath39 is bounded from below as a function of @xmath40 for any finite number of sites @xmath24 , with the global minimum @xmath41 obtained for @xmath42 .",
    "similarly to the work of ref .",
    "@xcite , we use standard gibbsian statistical mechanics to predict macroscopic average values in the thermodynamic limit , by treating the norm @xmath31 as analogous to number of particles in the grand - canonical ensemble . as in eq .",
    "( 2 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite , the grand - canonical partition function is thus defined as @xmath43 where @xmath44 ( in units of @xmath45 ) and @xmath46 play the roles of inverse temperature and chemical potential , respectively . using ( [ hama])-([norma ] ) and integrating over the phase variables @xmath47 yields @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the modified bessel function of the first kind . from this expression",
    ", one could proceed as in ref .",
    "@xcite by symmetrizing the partition function and using the transfer integral operator to obtain thermodynamic quantities in the limit @xmath50 , corresponding to the regime in @xmath51 parameter space with well - defined chemical potential and ( positive ) temperature .",
    "this is however not our main purpose here .",
    "instead , we focus on the phase transition line defined by the boundary of this regime ( @xmath52 , with @xmath53 finite ) , which signals the transition into the regime of persistent localization , suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite to be associated with a negative - temperature type behavior for finite lattices and time - scales .    close to the high - temperature limit @xmath54 , we can approximate the slowly increasing bessel function with @xmath55 ( which is mathematically equivalent to letting @xmath56 , corresponding physically to thermalized independent units ) .",
    "the partition function then becomes @xmath57 , where @xmath58dx \\\\ = \\frac{1}{\\beta \\mu } - \\frac{\\beta}{\\sigma+1}\\int_0^\\infty x^{\\sigma + 1 }   e^ { -\\beta \\mu x } dx   + \\frac{1}{2 } \\frac{\\beta^2}{(\\sigma+1)^2 } \\int_0^\\infty   x^{2(\\sigma + 1)}e^ { -\\beta \\mu x } dx + ... \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] but @xmath59 ( where @xmath60 is the gamma function , @xmath61 for integer @xmath62 ) .",
    "this yields @xmath63 thus , close to the limit of @xmath64 with @xmath65 constant , we can neglect all higher - order terms in @xmath66 , and obtain @xmath67 .",
    "finally , for the partition function in the high - temperature limit we get @xmath68 for small @xmath66 this reduces to @xmath69 , so that we have in the high - temperature limit for the average energy : @xmath70 and for the average norm @xmath71 ( the second term here is negligible . ) thus , the relation between the energy density @xmath72 and the norm density @xmath73 in the high - temperature limit is @xmath74 where @xmath75 can be replaced by @xmath76 for integer @xmath4 . note that the quantity @xmath77 indeed is well - defined and finite in the high - temperature limit for any nonzero norm density , @xmath78 according to ( [ aav ] ) .    for @xmath79 ,",
    "the corresponding phase diagram was illustrated in fig .  1 of ref",
    ".  @xcite .",
    "thus , for any given norm density @xmath80 , typical initial conditions with ( hamiltonian ) energy density @xmath81 smaller than the critical value ( [ 5 ] ) are expected to thermalize ( after sufficiently long times ) according to a gibbsian equilibrium distribution at temperature @xmath82 and chemical potential @xmath46 .",
    "the correspondence between @xmath83 and @xmath84 generally has to be found numerically through the transfer integral formalism as in ref .",
    "@xcite , but in the small - amplitude limit @xmath85 analytic expressions can be obtained as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , eqs .",
    "( 7)-(8 ) .",
    "numerical evidence that such a thermalization generally takes place after sufficiently long integration times was given in fig .  2 of ref .",
    "@xcite ( for @xmath79 ) .    on the other hand , for initial conditions with energy density @xmath81 larger than the critical value ( [ 5 ] ) this description breaks down , and one finds numerically that persistent large - amplitude standing breathers are created .",
    "heuristically , this can be understood as follows : for fixed norm @xmath31 , it is generally possible to maximize the hamiltonian @xmath30 , and the maximizing solution is a single - site peaked , exponentially localized stationary standing breather ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which for large @xmath31 becomes essentially localized at one site so that @xmath86 . considering in the microcanonical ensemble ( fixed @xmath87 and @xmath24 ) the entropy @xmath88 ( i.e.   the logarithm of the number of microstates ) as a function of @xmath30 , it is zero at @xmath89 defined above , increases towards its maximum when ( [ 5 ] ) is fulfilled and @xmath90 ( since @xmath91 ) , and then again decreases towards zero at @xmath92 .",
    "thus , in the microcanonical ensemble at finite @xmath31 and @xmath24 , the temperature is well - defined and becomes negative when @xmath93 is larger than the critical value ( [ 5 ] ) . returning to the grand - canonical ensemble , it is then possible for the part of the system which is in the negative - temperature regime to increase its entropy by transferring some of its superfluous energy into localized breathers , which consume only a small amount of the norm . in other words ,",
    "the overheated negative - temperature system cools itself off by creating breathers as hot spots of localized energy .",
    "such a mechanism for energy localization works quite generally in systems with two conserved quantities ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "indeed , this type of argument could be used to explicitly calculate the thermodynamic properties of the dnls model in the limit of small @xmath80 , where phase space naturally divides into a small - amplitude fluctuation part and a large - amplitude breather part @xcite which only interact weakly . in that case , the equilibrium state which maximizes the total entropy for @xmath81 larger than the critical value ( [ 5 ] ) should consist of one single breather , with the rest of the lattice corresponding to an ordinary gibbsian distribution at @xmath90 @xcite ( although the numerical simulations in ref .",
    "@xcite never reached such a state , but rather one with a finite breather density ) .",
    "however , when @xmath80 increases , the large - amplitude and small - amplitude parts will not separate straightforwardly anymore , and the thermodynamic equilibrium properties for general @xmath80 remain unknown . some of the numerical simulations reported below aim at shedding some light on this issue .",
    "let us now discuss the thermodynamical equilibrium distributions for some particularly interesting choices of initial conditions . for certain families of exact solutions we can analytically compute the curves @xmath94 , and thus within these families obtain the transition into the statistical localization regime by finding their intersections with the phase - transition line ( [ 5 ] ) . evidently ,",
    "if the initial condition is strictly an exact solution thermalization will not occur , but often solutions are linearly unstable e.g.  through modulational @xcite or oscillatory @xcite instabilities , which may cause rather rapid thermalization ( see e.g.  examples for @xmath79 in refs .",
    "even for weakly perturbed linearly stable solutions as initial conditions , it is expected that generically nonlinear instability mechanisms finally should lead to thermodynamic equilibrium ; however the equilibration times can be extremely long as arnold - type diffusion processes are involved .    in the numerical investigations below",
    ", we mainly focus on the distribution function @xmath95 for the amplitudes @xmath96 , which most clearly illustrates the localization properties . in the standard gibbsian regime , the statistical prediction for @xmath95 can also be obtained through the transfer integral formalism as show in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", let us only note that close to the high - temperature limit @xmath97 , this prediction yields ( again by approximating @xmath55 ) @xmath98 i.e. , the curvature is zero for @xmath99 and becomes negative ( positive ) for positive ( negative ) temperatures . thus",
    ", negative temperatures favor large - amplitude excitations .      for a traveling wave , which is an exact solution of the form @xmath100 ( with @xmath101 ) ,",
    "we have @xmath102 similarly as for the well known case @xmath79 @xcite , traveling waves with @xmath103 are modulationally unstable and those with @xmath104 linearly stable also for general @xmath105 ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . to find when such a solution crosses the @xmath99 curve we put ( [ 6 ] ) equal to ( [ 5 ] ) , which yields @xmath106 where , as before , @xmath107 can be replaced by @xmath108 for integer @xmath4 .",
    "thus , for any @xmath4 and @xmath103 , there is a threshold value for the norm density given by ( [ 7 ] ) , so that only above this threshold , one will be in the normal gibbsian positive - temperature regime , while below it we expect statistical localization . the predicted threshold , plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : threshold ] , becomes quite small for large @xmath4 due to the factorial in the denominator , but increases rapidly for @xmath4 smaller than 1 ( e.g. for @xmath109 , corresponding to 3-dimensional bose - einstein condensates in the model of ref .",

    "2 - 3 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , we had to choose initial conditions quite far from the transition line .",
    "then , fitting @xmath118 and @xmath66 in eq .",
    "( [ slope ] ) to the obtained distributions , we find small values of @xmath66 with the expected ( opposite ) signs in the two cases .",
    "we attribute the smallness of @xmath66 even for values of @xmath80 far from the transition point to the weakness of the nonlinear effects for small @xmath4 . moreover , as we illustrate with another example in the following subsection , the thermalizing dynamics in the localization regime is extremely slow for small @xmath4 .",
    "although we can clearly identify several breather - like excitations with amplitudes considerably higher than their surroundings in the simulations for @xmath119 , they are generally not persistent but transient and recurring .",

    "[ fig : last](b ) is likely to be related to the finite size of the system ) .",
    "thus , the breather - forming processes tend to polarize the lattice into hotter regions of larger oscillations and colder regions of smaller oscillations , although due to the repeated creation and destruction of breathers at different sites , the equipartition result @xmath368 is still valid for each site , provided that the time - average is taken over a sufficiently large interval . on the other hand , for the initial condition belonging to the non - breather - forming regime ( fig .  [",

    "we have shown how a statistical - mechanics description of a general class of discrete nonlinear schrdinger models yields explicit necessary conditions for formation of persistent localized modes , in terms of thermodynamic average values of the two conserved quantities @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "furthermore , we illustrated how this approach can be extended to approximately describe situations with non - conserved but slowly varying quantities ( see also ref .",

    ", we found that , in contrast to the condition for existence of an energy threshold for creation of a single breather , which involves only the product @xmath236 , @xmath4 and @xmath3 tend to work in opposite directions as concerns the statistical localization transition .",
    "the energy threshold affects only the approach to equilibrium and not the qualitative features of the equilibrium state .",
    "there are several directions in which we believe that this work should be continued .",
    "one important issue is to develop a quantitative theory determining the time - scales for approach to equilibrium in the breather - forming regime . as we have seen numerically",
    ", these time - scales may be extremely long , and naturally one may argue that the equilibrium states themselves are not physically relevant if they can only be reached after times of the order of @xmath369 .",
    "another important point regards , whether the hypothesis of separation of phase space in low - amplitude fluctuations and high - amplitude breathers in the equilibrium state on the breather - forming side of the transition can be put on more rigorous grounds .",
    "our numerical simulations are not completely conclusive in all the studied cases due to extremely long equilibration times , but give indications that this hypothesis could be valid also for large values of the norm density @xmath80 .",
    "finally , we stress the important connections to current experiments : very recently , unambiguous experimental observations of discrete modulational instabilities have been reported , for an optical nonlinear array @xcite , as well as for a bose - einstein condensate in a moving optical lattice @xcite .",
    "it will be very interesting to see , whether such experiments also can confirm the dnls result that the final outcome of these instabilities depend , in a qualitative and quantitative manner , on the particular values of the hamiltonian and norm densities ( the latter represents power in the optical case and particle density in the bose - einstein context ) as predicted here",
