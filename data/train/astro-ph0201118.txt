    "the first decade of the 21st century promises to become the golden age of extragalactic astronomy .",
    "the 2df and sloan digital sky surveys have already made significant contributions to our knowledge of the extragalactic universe .",
    "on - going and planned wide - field ( pencil - beam ) imaging and spectroscopic surveys with 4 m ( 8m)-class telescopes from the ground and in space ( e.g. , sirtf , sofia , herschel , ngst ) will nicely complement these large - scale surveys and should go a long way to answer some of the most fundamental questions in extragalactic astronomy : how do galaxies form ? how do they evolve ? how do supermassive black holes fit in this picture of galaxy formation ?",
    "which objects are the main contributors to the overall energy budget of the universe ? to properly answer these questions , one will need to differentiate objects powered by nuclear fusion in stars ( i.e.  normal and starburst galaxies ) from objects powered by mass accretion onto supermassive black holes ( quasars and agns ) . a wide variety of diagnostic tools have been used in the past for this purpose with different degree of success .",
    "due to space limitations , the present discussion focusses on _ emission - line _ diagnostics .",
    "the fundamental principles behind these diagnostics are reviewed in  2 .",
    "next , the main diagnostic tools available in the ultraviolet , optical , and infrared domains are described in  3 ,  4 , and  5 , respectively .",
    "a table listing the main diagnostic lines is given in each of these sections .",
    "additional factors which may complicate the use of these tools are discussed in  6 .",
    "a summary is given in  7 along with an outlook on the future .",
    "note that this review is not meant to be exhaustive ; it is meant to emphasize the practical aspects of starburst / agn spectral classification .",
    "readers who are looking for a more detailed discussion of the physics behind these diagnostic tools should refer to the original papers listed in the text .",
    "activity driven by mass accretion onto supermassive black holes differs in many ways from star - formation activity .",
    "the thermal and non - thermal processes associated with the accretion disk and its surroundings ( e.g. , corona ) are at the origin of the `` hard '' ionizing continuum detected in quasars and agns ( e.g. , krolik 1999 ) .",
    "material in the vicinity of the nucleus will bear the imprint of this strong radiation field .",
    "the deep gravitational potential at the center of these galaxies allows the presence of high - density ( @xmath0 10@xmath1 @xmath2 ) , high - velocity ( @xmath0 2000 km s@xmath3 ) gas clouds in the inner parsec of quasars and agns .",
    "this so - called broad - line region or blr is a powerful diagnostic of nuclear activity in galaxies .",
    "the main signatures of the blrs are broad recombination lines which are unaffected by the effects of collisional de - excitation at high densities .",
    "two general methods have been used in the past to detect blrs in galaxies : direct spectroscopy and spectropolarimetry .",
    "this last method relies on the presence of dust or electrons ( `` mirrors '' ) to scatter the blr signature towards the line of sight ( e.g. , antonucci 1993 ) .",
    "direct spectroscopy searches for the presence of the broad recombination lines at wavelengths where the effects of dust extinction are reduced .",

    "the ionizing spectra of all but the hottest o stars cut off near the he ii edge ( 54.4 ev ; dopita et al .",
    "in contrast , the ionizing spectrum of agns contains a relatively large fraction of high - energy photons ( e.g. , elvis et al . 1994 ) .",
    "optically thick gas clouds ionized by the hard continuum of agns will present a stratified ionization structure with ( 1 ) a highly ionized inner face ( closest to the agn ) , ( 2 ) a large partially zone with characteristic fraction of ionized hydrogen h@xmath17/h @xmath16 0.2  0.4 produced by the deposition of kev x - rays ( recall that the absorption cross sections of h@xmath18 , he@xmath18 , and all other ions decrease rapidly with increasing energy ; osterbrock 1989 ) , and ( 3 ) a neutral zone facing away from the agn .",
    "the fast free electrons in the partly ionized zone will have a positive effect on the strengths of low - ionization lines produced by collisional effects , while the highly ionized conditions in the inner face will favor the production of emission lines from ions with high ionization potentials ( e.g. , ferland & netzer 1983 ; ferland & osterbrock 1986 , 1987 ; binette , wilson , & storchi - bergmann 1996 ) .",
    "based on these physical principles , one should choose narrow emission line diagnostics following ten basic rules or `` commandments '' ( a reminder of the 1700th anniversary of the adoption of christianity as a national religion in armenia ) :    * thou shalt use lines which emphasize the differences between h  ii regions and agns ; i.e. , use high - ionization lines or low - ionization lines produced in the partially ionized zone . *",
    "thou shalt use strong lines which are easy to measure in typical spectra .",
    "* thou shalt avoid lines which are badly blended with other emission or absorption line features . *",
    "thou shalt use lines with small wavelength separation to minimize sensitivity to reddening .",
    "* thou shalt use line ratios from the same elements or involving hydrogen recombination lines to eliminate or reduce abundance dependence .",
    "* thou shalt avoid lines from mg , si , ca , fe  depleted onto dust grains .",
    "* thou shalt use lines easily accessible to current uv / optical / ir detectors . *",
    "thou shalt avoid lines affected by strong stellar absorption features .",
    "* thou shalt avoid lines affected by strong atmospheric features .",
    "* thou shalt use lines at long wavelengths to reduce the effects of dust extinction .",
    "when possible , ultraviolet diagnostic tools should be avoided because of their sensitivity to dust extinctions ( see the tenth commandment and table 1 ) . however , investigators of the high - redshift universe often have very little choice but to study this region of the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "the ultraviolet domain is potentially a rich source of diagnostic lines .",

    "objects with `` warm '' infrared colors ( e.g. , iras @xmath34 0.2 ) often harbor an agn at optical or near - infrared wavelengths or in polarized light ( de grijp et al . 1985 ; veilleux et al .",

    "the redshift dependence of the relative abundances of the elements involved in the emission - line ratios is a complex function of the star formation history and chemical evolution ( including the effects of gas accretion and outflows ) of the host galaxy environment ( see , e.g. , hamann & ferland 1999 for a discussion of qso hosts ) .",
    "the usefulness of emission - line diagnostics at high redshifts will directly depend on the availability of accurate metallicity measurements and diagnostic tools properly calibrated in terms of metallicity .",
    "uv  optical  ir emission - line ratios are powerful diagnostics tools to discriminate between starbursts and agns .",
    "the following ratios have been shown to be the most reliable tools for this purpose .    *",

    "* shock ionization : if shocks are important , one would generally expect correlations between the line ratios and gas kinematics , a uv continuum extended on the same scale as the shock structure , and high gas temperatures . * aperture effects : one should use a constant linear aperture to avoid variations in the contributions from circumnuclear starbursts . *",
    "morphological bias : the spectral classification is likely to depend on the morphology of the host , especially the merger phase .",
    "selection methods based on morphology will bias the sample .",
    "* metallicity : massive host galaxies in the local universe have larger metallicity , but high - redshift galaxies should be less dusty and less metal rich .",
    "one needs to use emission - line diagnostics which are properly calibrated as a function of metallicity and reddening .",
    "several new instruments will help refine the diagnostic tools discussed in this paper .",
    "the cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ) , to be installed in 2003 on hst , will provide the high ultraviolet throughput needed to calibrate the uv diagnostic tools as a function of metallicity , evaluate the importance of shock ionization with the use of the c iii and niii temperature - sensitive line ratios , and to help resolve the circumnuclear starbursts and shock - excited winds around agns .",
    "the advent of sirtf will help in the calibration of the infrared diagnostic tools as a function of metallicity _ and dust extinction_. this spacecraft will also be a powerful instrument to search for infrared - bright agns .",
    "ground - based work with adaptive optics and integral - field units will improve the sensitivity of searches for obscured agns by focussing on the inner regions of galaxies and avoiding the circumnuclear material associated with other phenomena .",
    "spectroscopic follow - ups from the ground will help identify and classify agn candidates in space - based and submm - selected samples .",
    "the ground - based study on ultraluminous infrared galaxies discussed in this paper is done in collaboration with drs .",
