    "optical fiber grating sensors are becoming increasingly widespread in a wide range of applications @xcite .",
    "their characteristics include immunity to electromagnetic interference , high sensitivity , fast response , and keeping their calibration with time .",
    "furthermore they possess a high tolerance to harsh environments such as sea water , concrete , and extreme temperatures .",
    "the measured parameter , the resonant wavelength of the grating , is usually linear in the magnitude of the measurand , e.g. temperature or strain , allowing for an accurate quantitative estimate of the measurand .",
    "photonic crystal fibers ( pcfs ) @xcite are optical fibers , in which the cladding consists of a microstructured array of air holes running along the fiber axis . here",
    "we consider index guiding pcfs , which have a solid core in the form of a missing air hole in the center . in index",
    "guiding pcfs light is confined to the core by modified total internal reflection , analogous to guiding in standard optical fibers .",
    "the holes in the cladding are most commonly placed in a periodic triangular structure , which is characterized by a lattice constant ( pitch ) and the diameter of the holes .",
    "pcfs are typically made of silica @xcite or , more recently , polymer materials , where they are termed microstructured polymer optical fibers ( mpofs ) @xcite .",
    "the hole structure in the cladding determines the optical properties of the pcf , which allows for a large degree of freedom in tayloring key properties , such as dispersion and group velocity .",
    "in standard optical fibers the silica in the core contains dopants to increase the refractive index .",
    "the refractive index of the doped silica is sensitive to uv radiation and this may be used for inscription of gratings .",
    "this technique can not be used for pure silica pcfs , since the core is not uv sensitive . for long - period gratings ( lpgs ) in pcfs other techniques exist , such as using an electric arc @xcite , a co@xmath1 laser @xcite , or mechanical microdeformation @xcite .",
    "otherwise the pcf can be specially made with a uv sensitive core for fiber gratings allowing for the inscription of both lpgs and bragg gratings ( bgs ) @xcite .",
    "polymer has a smaller young s modulus and greater elastic limit than silica , which makes it a good material for measuring strain and bending .",
    "in addition , polymer is biocompatible and can bind biomolecules directly to its surface , making it ideal for biosensing .",
    "standard polymer optical fibers are made of poly - methyl methacrylate ( pmma ) , which is inherently photosensitive , allowing for both bgs @xcite and lpgs @xcite to be inscribed using a uv lamp .",
    "the inherent uv sensitivity was also recently used to write bgs in mpof @xcite , whereas heat treatment under mechanical stress was used to write the first permanent lpg in an mpof @xcite .",
    "an important property of grating sensors in silica pcfs are that they are largely temperature insensitive , showing @xmath2 1 pm / k for both bgs @xcite and lpgs @xcite .",
    "the strain sensitivity is of the same order for lpgs and bgs in pcfs , and thus strain sensors may be realized with reduced cross sensitivity to temperature sensing .",
    "in addition , the holes of a pcf can be infiltrated with a substance having a high temperature coefficient to reduce or enhance the temperature sensitivity @xcite .",
    "whereas fiber - optic strain and temperature sensors use the material properties of the fiber , fiber - optic biosensors and refractive index sensors use the principle of evanescent wave sensing .",
    "in particular , there is a growing interest in optical biochemical sensors @xcite . here",
    "pcfs have the advantage that the analyte may be infiltrated into the air holes and thereby create a strong interaction with the probing electromagnetic field @xcite .",
    "when using mpofs one can take advantage of different polymers with special biosensing properties , such as topas @xcite .",
    "liquid infiltrated pcf - lpgs @xcite and pcf - bgs @xcite have been demonstrated , which is an important step towards the ultimate goal of developing a so - called _ label - free _ biosensor in a pcf .",
    "fiber gratings potentially allow for label - free biosensing with pcfs @xcite by tracking how the grating resonance changes during operation .",
    "this may open for new possibilities in biomedical applications @xcite .",
    "the dispersion plays a crucial role for all types of grating sensors in standard optical fibers @xcite .",
    "the dispersion of pcfs depends strongly on the hole structure in the cladding and thus the performance of the pcf grating sensor can be designed by an appropriate choice of pitch and hole size .    in this paper",
    "we explore the possibility of optimizing the hole structure of pcfs for sensing purposes .",
    "we do this by analyzing the sensitivity of triangular pcf gratings for different pitch and hole diameters .",
    "the applications under study are biosensing , refractive index sensing , strain , and temperature sensing .",
    "we show that the sensitivity is strongly influenced by the choice of the structural parameters of the pcf .",
    "we employ realistic values for the fibers parameters and give realistic values of pitch and hole diameter that minimize or maximize the sensitivity to different measurands .",
    "we find that bgs are best characterized in the usual way by their sensitivity , @xmath3 , defined as the resonant wavelength shift divided by the resonant wavelength .",
    "in contrast , we find that the lpgs are best characterized by their quality factor , @xmath0 , defined as the resonant wavelength shift divided by the full - width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the resonance dip .",
    "the eigenmodes of the pcfs for a temporally harmonic electrical field , @xmath4 , may be found from helmholtz eigenvalue equation , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the angular frequency , c is the speed of light in vacuum , @xmath7 is the dielectric function , and @xmath8 is the transverse coordinate vector .",

    "the hole diameter , @xmath25 , and pitch , @xmath26 , are indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : analyte ] . large hole diameters and",
    "small pitch also give a small core and therefore a strong effective nonlinearity .",
    "triangular silica pcfs are single mode for @xmath27 for all wavelengths [ ] . for small hole sizes ( @xmath28 ) the pcf is only weakly guiding , and bend losses increase drastically .",
    "bend losses also become pronounced in the short wavelength limit , @xmath29 , regardless of hole diameter .",
    "pcfs can be designed to have a large mode area .",
    "the transmission spectrum of an lpg in a pcf only shows a few cladding mode resonances , whereas several resonances are seen in a standard optical fiber lpg spectrum .",
    "the cladding modes of a pcf are different from the cladding modes of a standard optical fiber , since the fiber cross sections obey very different symmetries .",
    "in particular a pcf obeys a six - fold rotational symmetry ( @xmath30 ) while the standard optical fiber has circular symmetry .",
    "the effective indices of the cladding modes of a pcf are closely spaced , and this spacing is much smaller than the difference between the core effective index and the effective index of any cladding mode . in other words ,",
    "the beat length between any two cladding modes is much longer than the beat length between a cladding mode and the core mode . in practice",
    "we can assume @xmath31 for all cladding modes , where the fundamental space filling mode , @xmath32 , is the effective index of an infinite cladding structure spanned by the lattice vectors in fig .",

    "the theory assumes that near resonance the electromagnetic field propagating through the fiber may be expressed as a superposition of eigenmodes of the unperturbed fiber @xmath37 , where ` @xmath38 ' denotes a resonant mode , and the @xmath39 s are amplitude coefficients that depend on @xmath9 due to the perturbation . for bragg gratings",
    "the resonant mode is the counter propagating core mode , and for long - period gratings the resonant mode is a copropagating higher order mode , usually a cladding mode .",
    "the coupled - mode equations constitute a set of linear coupled differential equations .",
    "they may be expressed in a compact matrix form as @xmath40 = -i\\left [ \\begin{array}{cc } 0 & \\kappa_i e^{i\\delta_i z } \\\\ \\kappa_i^",

    "there is a layer of air @xmath112 thick to reduce the effects of a finite cladding .",
    "the large number of rings of air holes is chosen such that effects of a finite cladding is small .",
