    "in 1936 birkhoff and von neumann @xcite have shown the existence of a propositional calculus as fundamental ingredient of quantum mechanics ( qm ) , which could be written using only the outputs of measures .",
    "it does not assume any set of numbers or even a particular vectorial space , but contains the essentials of qm such as uncertainty relations and complementary properties .",
    "of course , the authors showed that there are three different realizations for this propositional calculus , corresponding to the real or complex numbers or still quaternions .",
    "octonions and higher dimensional extensions of the complex numbers are discarded , since they can not have a conservation law for the probability current @xcite .",
    "we can ask : which of these three realizations of the general  qm of birkhoff and von neumann is present in nature ?",
    "here it is implicit the hypothesis that the set of numbers of a given theory reflects part of the physical information about the system . while the differences between the real and complex qm are relatively simple and well known @xcite , the quaternionic version has many new and rich characteristics . therefore , it sounds strange that such possibility is not much  explored , but there are very good reasons for this .",
    "first , the problem of writing a quaternionic schrdinger equation is not trivial since it involves the explicit use of imaginary unit .",
    "second , the representation of composite systems by a direct product is more difficult due to the noncommutativity of the quaternionic valued wave functions .    here , we implement a quaternionic version of schwinger s measurement algebra and build the dynamics based on the action principle . in each step",
    ", the analogy with the usual qm is used as inspiration , but the peculiarities emerging from the quaternionic noncommutativity are always emphasized .",
    "the theory constructed by this means is quite distinct from adler s approach @xcite , having similarities with the work of finkelstein , jauch , schiminovich and speiser , @xcite .",
    "the classical theory of physical measurements is based on the concept that the interaction between the system under observation and the measurement apparatus can be done arbitrarily small or , at least , precisely compensated , in such way to specify an idealized measurement which does not disturb any other property of the system .",
    "however , the experiment had demonstrated that the interaction can not be done arbitrarily small neither the disturb produced can be precisely compensated since it is uncontrollable and unpredictable .",
    "the fact that the interaction can not be arbitrarily small is expressed by the finite size of the planck constant , while the uncontrollable character of the interaction is given by the uncertainty principle .",
    "therefore , the measurement of a given property can produce a significant change in the value of another previously measured property , and then there is no sense in speaking about an microscopic system with definite values for all its attributes .",
    "this is in contradiction with the classical representation of physical quantities by numbers",
    ". the laws of a microscopic physical system must then be expressed in a non - classical mathematical language constituting a symbolic expression of the properties of microscopic measurements .    in what follows",
    ", we will develop the general lines of such mathematical structure discussing about simplified physical systems where any physical quantity @xmath0 can have only a finite number of different values @xmath1 ... .",
    "the most simple measurement consider an ensemble of similar independent systems which is divided by the apparatus of measurement in sub - ensembles distinguished by the defined values of the physical quantity under measurement .",
    "let us denote @xmath2 the selective measurement accepting any system having value @xmath3 for the property @xmath0 and rejecting any other .",
    "the addition of such symbols is defined as implying a less specific measure , resulting in a sub - ensemble associated with any value under the sum , none of them being distinguished of the others by the measurement .",
    "the multiplication of measurement symbols implies the sequence of measurements reading from right to left . from the physical meaning of such operations",
    ", we learn that addition is commutative and associative while multiplication is only associative . using @xmath4 and @xmath5 to represent respectively the measures which accept and reject all systems , the properties of the elementary selective measurement",
    "are given by    @xmath6    from the meaning of the measurements represented by @xmath4 and @xmath5 we directly read the following algebraic properties :    @xmath7    what justifies the adopted notation .",
    "the algebraic properties of @xmath4 , @xmath8 and @xmath2 are consistent provided that the multiplication be distributive , @xmath9    all laws of multiplication for measurement symbols given above can be combined in a single expression , @xmath10 with the introduction of the symbol @xmath11 known as _ _",
    "kronecker s _ _ _ delta_.    from these definitions one sees that the measurement symbols belong to a noncommutative ring @xcite .",
    "two quantities @xmath12 and @xmath13 are compatible when the measurement of one of them does not destroy the knowledgement of a previous measurement of the other . the selective measures @xmath14 and @xmath15 , taken in this order , produce an ensemble where it is possible , simultaneously , to attribute the values @xmath16 to @xmath12 and @xmath17 to @xmath13 . the symbol for such composite measurement is @xmath18 from such definition it is easy to see that the compatibility is an equivalence relation .",
    "a complete set @xmath0 of compatible quantities @xmath19 means that any pair of such properties is compatible and there is no other compatible quantity outside the set , except the functions constructed from the set @xmath0 . in fact , @xmath0 is an _",
    "equivalence class_. the measurement symbol @xmath20 describes a complete measurement where the selected systems have definite values for the maximum number of possible attributes .",
    "any tentative for determining the value of another independent physical quantity will produce uncontrollable changes on the previously measured values .",
    "therefore , the optimum information about a given system is achieved making a complete selective measurement .",
    "the systems accepted by the complete selective measurement @xmath2 are known to being in the state @xmath3 .",
    "the symbolic properties for the complete measures are the same as for the elementary selective measurements , i.e. , ( [ medida1 ] ) , ( [ medida2 ] ) and ( medida3 ) .",
    "a more general kind of measure incorporates a change on the state of the system .",
    "the symbol @xmath21 represents a complete selective measurement which accepts systems in the @xmath16 state and let out systems in the state @xmath3 .",
    "the measurement process @xmath2 is the special case when no change on the state occurs,@xmath22    the properties of successive measurements of this specie are given by @xmath23 since if @xmath24 the second stage of the apparatus does not select any system emerging from the first one , and if @xmath25 all systems coming from the first stage are accepted by the second , being the composite measurement a selection of systems in the state @xmath26 and letting it out in the state @xmath16 .",
    "observe that if we interchange both stages , then @xmath27 what is not the same as ( [ medidaprod ] ) .",
    "therefore , we realize that the multiplication of complete measurements symbols is noncommutative .",
    "the physical quantities belonging to a complete set do not exhaust the totality of physical attributes in a system .",
    "one can form others complete sets @xmath28 ... , which are mutually incompatible and , for each choice of non - interfering physical characteristics , there is a set of selective measurements concerning to systems in the appropriate states @xmath29 ... the most general selective measurement links two complete sets of incompatible properties .",
    "let @xmath30 be the measurement process rejecting all systems which are not in the state @xmath31 and allowing to emerge only systems in the state @xmath3 .",
    "the composite measurement @xmath32 will select systems in the state @xmath33 and let them in the state @xmath3 , so it should be proportional to the selective measurement @xmath34 .",
    "the examples considered until now include the passing of all or none system through both stages , as realized by the symbols @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "notwithstanding , in general we can just admit that measures of the property @xmath35 upon a system in the state @xmath36 , which belongs to a complete set incompatible with @xmath37 , will furnishes an statistical distribution of all possible results .",
    "so , only a fraction of the systems emerging from the first stage is accepted by the second one .",
    "we can express this by the general multiplication law : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a number characterizing the statistical relationship between the states @xmath31 and @xmath36 .",
    "in particular , @xmath40 where @xmath41 means that @xmath3 and @xmath42 are defined sets of values for the complete set @xmath0 . since that the numbers @xmath43 link the states @xmath3 and @xmath31 they are called _",
    "transformation function_.    the measurement symbols @xmath44 equipped with addition and multiplication as defined above and together with the scalar ring @xmath45 form an algebra , which we call the _ measurement algebra_. observe that nothing was said about the particular set of numbers @xmath39  to be adopted .",
    "in fact , as matter for mathematical and physical meaning consistency , it is enough that @xmath45 belongs to an scalar ring .",
    "of course , the order in which the scalars @xmath43appear in the product ( [ prodgeral ] ) is very important , since it reflects on the ring multiplication law , allowing the definition of different measurement algebras .",
    "therefore , the most general form to indicate the multiplication rule for measurement symbols is @xmath46 since it does not make any reference to the order of the scalar on the product .",
    "however , we will maintain the scalars on a preferable central position on the product .",
    "our main interest here is to suppose that the scalars are quaternions and investigate what are the physical implications of such assumption .",
    "the reason to take the scalars on a central multiplicative position comes from the recognition that measurement symbols are in fact projectors on the several possible states of two different complete sets of observables . to reinforce such character ,",
    "we adopt the notation@xmath47    then , the most general way in which a measurement symbol can appear together an scalar is@xmath48 being @xmath49 any element of the ring under which the measurement algebra is defined . as stated before , we will assume that the numbers @xmath49 are _ quaternions _ , defined by @xmath50 when @xmath51 we simply denote @xmath52 .",
    "this notation is useful because it maintains separated in an explicitly way the two parts of the measurement symbol corresponding to the physical hilbert space of states @xmath53 and its dual @xmath54 . in the language of second quantization , this notation directly alludes to the annihilation ( right ) and creation ( left ) processes of particles or field fluctuations involved in a measurement act .",
    "it is important to stand out that since the products of vector _ by _ scalars are defined over a noncommutative ring , these products have sense only a _ definite _ order , which we take as right for the kets @xmath55 and left for the bras @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the hilbert space of eigenstates of a given complete set of observables .",
    "quaternions are a particular realization of a _ clifford algebra _",
    "lounesto , so a even more general theory can be recognized .",
    "the fundamental transformation law for the measurement symbols is essentially unaffected by the specific choice of the scalar ring . actually ,",
    "using the notation of the previous section , measurement symbols of one kind can be transformed in symbols of another kind : @xmath58    carefully preserving the composition of products , one can interpret this relation as a double mapping of vectors @xmath59  and covectors  @xmath60 on the linear combinations @xmath61  and @xmath62 respectively .",
    "therefore , the composition law for transformation functions in a quaternionic ring is @xmath63 from which we obtain the completeness relations@xmath64    however , since quaternions do not commute , the preservation of the number of degrees of freedom imply that@xmath65 except for systems with only one degree of freedom , this does not mean that @xmath66 for any pair of quaternionic transformation functions .",
    "then , the relation ( [ comutq ] ) implies a restriction , but its interpretations is not easy .",
    "one of the most important actions over the measurement algebra is the _ trace functional _ , which associates each element of the algebra to one scalar . since here",
    "the scalar ring is noncommutative , there are three kinds of trace functional called respectively _ left , right _ and _ central _",
    "trace:@xmath67@xmath68@xmath69    in the standard complex case , the trace functional is related to the statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics . here",
    "we have a more complicated situation since none of the above trace functionals has an invariant law of transformation .",
    "nevertheless , the multiplication law is invariant under the following mapping :    [ transfsemeq ] @xmath70 where quaternions @xmath71 , @xmath72 are not null . therefore , the transformation function @xmath43 can not itself have a direct physical interpretation , and shall configure in a combination invariant under ( [ transfsemeq ] ) .",
    "the appropriate basement for the statistical interpretation of the transformation function can be inferred from a sequence of elementary measurement , @xmath73 , which differs from @xmath74 only by virtue of the disturbance caused by the intermediary measurement of the attribute @xmath0 .",
    "only a fraction of the systems selected by the initial measurement of @xmath37 is transmitted through the complete set .",
    "hence , we obtain the following symbolic statement :    @xmath75    where the number @xmath76 should be invariant under ( [ transfsemeq ] ) .",
    "it means that@xmath77    now , if one considers a measurement of the property @xmath0 which does not distinguish between two states , one arrives on the additivity of @xmath78@xmath79so , taking a measurement of @xmath0 unable to select any of such states , one obtains @xmath80what implies : @xmath81such properties characterize @xmath82 as a _ probability measure _ @xcite of observing the state @xmath3 in a measurement made over a system known to be in the state @xmath31",
    ". however , probability measures are positive real numbers , then we must to impose a restriction on the the numbers which figure in the measurement algebra .",
    "until now , all we have made can be applied equally to quaternions or complex numbers .",
    "in fact , no physical information was used to select the nature of such numbers , being only necessary they form a scalar ring in order to obtain an algebra from the elementary selective measurements .",
    "therefore , any field , as @xmath83 or @xmath84 , for instance , is candidate to figure as scalars in this construction of the quantum theory , but also a ring which is not a field , as quaternions or octonions , could be used .",
    "the extension of quantum mechanics that we want to do here is to get quaternions as the scalar ring used to construct the measurement algebra .",
    "so , the probability measure @xmath82 must satisfy @xmath85 . besides , the arbitrary reading convention in the multiplicative law implies that such probability shall be _",
    "symmetric_. the simplest way to accomplish all these properties is to demand @xmath86 and @xmath87 to be a conjugated pair . of course , in such case one obtains@xmath88@xmath89    on the other hand,@xmath90 this let us with the following statements:@xmath91    again , the simplest way to solve this system is taking@xmath92 with this choice one is able to recover all the properties of the probability measure @xmath82 .    using an exponential representation for @xmath71",
    "we see that the first condition above can be written in the form @xmath93 where @xmath94 ^{1/2 } \\\\",
    "e_{\\lambda } & = \\frac{\\lambda_{a}^{1}e_{1}+\\lambda_{a}^{2}e_{2}+\\lambda _ { a}^{3}e_{3}}{\\left [ \\left ( \\lambda_{a}^{1}\\right ) ^{2}+\\left ( \\lambda_{a}^{2}\\right ) ^{2}+\\left ( \\lambda_{a}^{3}\\right ) ^{2}\\right ] ^{1/2 } } \\\\ \\varphi\\left ( a\\right ) & = \\arctan\\left ( \\frac{\\lambda_{a}^{0}}{\\left\\vert \\lambda_{a}\\right\\vert } \\right ) \\quad\\varphi\\left ( a\\right ) \\in\\left [ 0,\\pi% \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the choice for the signal in @xmath0 is arbitrary and no physical effect can be distinguished by one particular choice .",
    "therefore we will take the positive signal .",
    "since @xmath71 is a unitary arbitrary number its phase @xmath95 can be an arbitrary real number .",
    "thus , besides the problems concerning about the definition of the trace functional one is still able to construct an statistical interpretation for the quaternionic quantum mechanics .",
    "in fact , such result indicates that the roots for the statistical interpretation are in the propositional calculus of birkhoff and von neumann @xcite , and not in the particular system of numbers adopted to construct the theory .",
    "another very important piece for the construction of the statistical interpretation was the automorphism @xmath96  for the scalar ring @xmath97 .",
    "but , physically , what means such identification ?",
    "we know that the elements of the scalar ring represent logical relations between the possible physical states of the system under consideration .",
    "clearly , it is even possible to say when two of such relation are the same thing  for states taken in distinct physical systems without departing the traditional concepts of pure logic , i.e. , without using the concepts of structured networks introduced by birkhoff and von neumann birkhoff - neumann .",
    "however , this defines such numbers modulo automorphisms @xcite . in the case of a quantum theory with only real numbers",
    "this is sufficient to determine completely such numbers @xcite . in the complex case",
    ", it still stands an ambiguity , which is manifested under the existence of a conjugated algebra . in quaternionic quantum mechanics such",
    "ambiguousness is infinitely bigger .",
    "this requires the introduction of more structure elements in the theory . in the following",
    "we will delimitate what are suchs structures .",
    "other important aspect of the probabilistic interpretation for ( probtrans ) is the symmetry @xmath98    remember the arbitrary convention for reading the measurement symbols and their products : the order of the events is read from right to left . but any equation involving the measurement symbols is equally valid if interpreted in the opposite sense and none physical result can depend of what is the convention adopted . introducing the right - handed interpretation , @xmath99",
    "acquire the same meaning of @xmath100 in the left - handed convention .",
    "we can conclude that the probability connecting the states @xmath3 and @xmath31 in a given sequence must be constructed symmetrically from @xmath43 and @xmath101 .",
    "of course , this is the reason why @xmath102  should be symmetric .",
    "the introduction of the opposite convention for the measurement symbols will be called the _ adjoint _ operation and will denoted by @xmath103 . therefore , @xmath104 and @xmath105    in particular , @xmath106 what means that @xmath2 is a self - adjoint operator . for the product of measurements symbols we have @xmath107",
    "the meaning of addition is not changed by the adjoint operation what permits to extend these properties for all element in the measurement algebra : @xmath108 where @xmath109 .",

    ", it is an open question what constant should be chosen since actually we have _ tree _ imaginary unities .",
    "the most general case is let the imaginary unity to be an _ operator _",
    "@xmath115 where @xmath116 can be considered as a particular case for @xmath84 .",
    "let it be so , defining@xmath117 where @xmath115 is a quaternionic valued operator that we will be fixed later under the requirement of @xmath118  be a self - adjoint operator . using this definition it is easy to see that the additivity and the skewsymmetry in ordering infinitesimal operators are the same as in the complex case @xcite,@xmath119@xmath120    on the other hand,@xmath121 what let us to the operatorial identity,@xmath122    if we impose@xmath123@xmath124 = \\hat{0 }    \\label{superselecao}\\ ] ] we obtain:@xmath125    this identity can be interpreted as a generalization of the complex conjugation over @xmath84 , and shows that the operator @xmath115behaves like an imaginary unit .",
    "the condition ( [ autoadjq ] ) assures the reality of the spectrum associated to infinitesimal operators . the condition ( [ superselecao ] ) can be satisfied in several ways :    1 .   demanding that all infinitesimal operator commutes with the imaginary unity ; 2 .   letting the imaginary unity to commute with any operator ; 3 .",
    "claiming that an infinitesimal operator commutes with any other operator .    in the standard quantum mechanics schwinger",
    "choose the last option schwinger , which was subsequently extended to more general variations by several authors @xcite .",
    "here , we can see no reason to discard the other two options .",
    "in fact , in their work on quaternionic quantum theory , finkelstein , jauch schiminovich and speiser @xcite have adopted a particular case of the second option in the list above interpreting it as a superselection rule . ] . for while",

    "of course , this last hypothesis is contained in the statement 2 of the section [ condicoes ] and it imply that the _ operator _ @xmath115 is actually a constant imaginary pure quaternion .",
    "the schwinger measurement algebra formulation for quantum kinematics is a powerful tool to disconnect the physical contents in quantum measurements from the mathematical requirements of consistence . at same time",
    ", it provides a natural way to achieve generalizations of standard quantum mechanics and provide a clear view of the price paid for such generalizations .    in particular ,",
    "besides we have found difficulties to construct a linear functional relating operators and values in the quaternionic ring , it was still possible to achieve a well defined statistical interpretation for quaternionic quantum mechanics .",
    "the essential elements for such construction are the noncompatibility of successive measurements , providing the fundamental law of multiplication for measurement symbols , and the automorphism @xmath96  of the scalar ring . in principle",
    ", any theory with these basic characteristics can also have an statistical interpretation .",
    "notwithstanding , for an appropriate interpretation , some additional properties are required for the probability measure @xmath82 , such as the conservation of their associated current in a closed system .",
    "in fact , it is the essential feature that adler used to prove the non - extensivity of quantum mechanics for octonions or higher dimension hypercomplex numbers @xcite .",
    "it must be stressed that there are several problems which are not investigated above , such as the effect of the superselection rules ( superselcpq ) over representations of the canonical variables @xmath139and @xmath138 , or the physical effects of the new quaternionic degrees of freedom .",
    "although we have not treated composite systems ( i.e. , many particle systems ) it is possible to advance some characteristics which should originate from the quaternionic noncommutativity .",
    "it is well known that in the classical physics there are no phase relations to be considered among subsystems of a bigger system ( non - interacting particles ) if we sum or multiply ( by cartesian product ) their phase spaces .",
    "in complex quantum mechanics there are phase relations between states which are important if we sum their state spaces , but they are not important for the product of such spaces ( understood as a tensorial product ) . in quaternionic quantum mechanics",
    "these phase relations should be important whatever one is dealing with sum or product of spaces , since the phase factor now is a quaternion .",
    "this new feature of quaternionic quantum mechanics can be interpreted in terms of a complementarity argument . in classical physics",
    "does exist complementarity relations because all measurements can , in principle , have an infinity precision . in the real and complex quantum mechanics",
    "there are complementarity relations among physical properties of the same system , but not between properties of different non - interacting systems . in quaternionic quantum mechanics",
    "there are complementarity between some properties for any pair of physical systems or subsystems .",
    "this is because the phase factor @xmath162  can not be additively composed when multiplying quaternions , as specified in the section [ estatistica ] . therefore , there is no reasonable way to form composite systems in order to have all observables associated in one system to be compatible with all the observables in any other systems or , in other words , to commute with all the others observables in different systems .",
    "actually , one can expect this to be greater difficulty to describe many particle systems in quaternionic quantum theory    it is important to observe that besides the notion of a quaternionic hilbert space has been a little vague here it is possible to develop the concepts the geometry of states , as done by schwinger @xcite , for the quaternionic ring .",
    "the idea and properties of such vectorial space emerge naturally in the geometry of states .",
    "this was not done here simply by matters of space and convenience since that we were interested not only on the kinematical side , but also in the dynamic aspects of the quaternionic theory . for those interested in the spectral theory of quaternionic hilbert spaces",

    "one can observe that the points where the operator @xmath115  appears are essentially the same where the planck constant @xmath163 should be .",
    "of course , using a different system of units , one realizes that the operator @xmath164  takes the place of the combination @xmath165 accordingly the analogy applied here . by this way",
    ", the introduction of operators which fail to commute with @xmath115 can be understood as to promote the planck constant  to a new dynamic variable , being interesting to investigate the fluctuations in the quantum of action in such case . on the other hand , the superselection rule expressed by the second condition in the section [ condicoes ] together with the hypothesis made in the final of the section [ iconst ]",
    "classical _ meaning to @xmath115 excluding the interference between their different states .",
    "this is equivalent to freezethe actual value of the imaginary unity operator suppressing this new possibilities .",
    "therefore , we find a natural extension of the equations ( eqschqconst ) admitting that the operator @xmath115  actually is a new _ fundamental field _ , i.e. , a new dynamic variable which depends from the space - time point where it is observed .",
    "this idea was partially developed in @xcite where it is proposed a quaternionic general covariance principle , which means a theory for the parallel transport of quaternions over a manifold , and a field equation for the operator @xmath115 .",
    "one of the most surprising results of this theory is that the field equations obtained are very similar to the electromagnetic ones but with _ three _ fundamental vectorial bosons , one neutral and massless and two others massive and charged .",
    "so , quaternionic quantum mechanics could be considered one of the first attempts to construct an unified theory for the electroweak interactions ( 1963 ) and perhaps could model at least a sector of the complete electroweak interactions .",
