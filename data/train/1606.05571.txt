    "the already vast and still growing research area of spintronics offers a new functionality for solid - state devices based on the spin of electrons rather than their charge  @xcite . in this context , graphene and carbon nanotubes ( cnts )",
    "are regarded as extremely promising materials  @xcite , since the spin lifetime is long due to the small spin - orbit coupling and due to a low natural abundance of c@xmath0 nuclear spins  @xcite .",
    "additionally , the fermi velocity of these materials is very high resulting in short dwell times within a device .",
    "this combination can , in turn , lead to a large magnetoresistance ( mr ) effect as well as to a large absolute change of resistance both important for a good performance of spin - valve devices  @xcite .",
    "a key issue for such devices is to enhance the spin injection efficiency by optimizing both the contact material  @xcite and the tunnel barrier  @xcite .",
    "another major point , not discussed in depth so far , regards the fact that many interesting effects in spintronic devices stem from the spin - orbit coupling  @xcite . to tune the mr effect efficiently with a gate voltage , for instance , as in a spin transistor , a strong spin - orbit coupling ( soc )",
    "is desired .",
    "though the soc is very weak in graphene  @xcite , it can be strongly enhanced by adatoms that induce local @xmath1 hybridization in the carbon bonds  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the spin - orbit interaction in cnts is stronger for the same reason due to their curvature  @xcite and has been found to be even larger in some devices  @xcite .",
    "a gate voltage will tune the mr effect in such materials rather efficiently , however , this is usually achieved on the expense of the spin relaxation time that is the great asset of carbon materials .    in this paper , we present model calculations that reveal another option for gate - controlled spin devices that avoids enhancing the spin - orbit coupling and therefore spin relaxation .",
    "we demonstrate that in quasi one - dimensional devices the mr effect can show a strong tunability with gate voltage depending on the properties of tunnel barriers arising at the interfaces of the electrodes . in particular",
    ", we systematically analyze how the strength and spin - selectiveness of these tunnel barriers affect magneto - transport characteristics of a ballistic one - dimensional spin valve employing a cnt as model system .",
    "this aspect seems to be of key importance for full understanding of the injection of spin - polarized electrons into a cnt , and it has not been examined in full detail hitherto . actually , although spin - dependent transport through a cnt attached to ferromagnetic metallic electrodes has been the subject of extensive experimental studies for almost two decades  @xcite , only recently the role of the tunnel barrier strength in this process has been addressed  @xcite showing that the mr of a device is significantly influenced by this factor .    for the purpose of this study",
    ", we consider a cnt - based spin valve that basically acts as an electronic interferometer , a setup employed formerly both in experiment  @xcite and theoretically  @xcite . in order to capture the effect of electrode - cnt interfaces , at which tunnel barriers form ,",
    "we treat them as spin - dependent dirac - delta potentials .",
    "a similar approach has been used to study spin injection between a ferromagnetic metal and a two - dimensional electron system  @xcite .",
    "then , calculations of spin - dependent transport through a device are derived by means of the scattering matrix approach .",
    "we find that engineering of the strength and spin - selective properties of the tunnel barriers in combination with the gate - voltage tuning provides a path for obtaining devices in which the magnitude of mr effect can be adjusted in a broad range from @xmath2% up to @xmath3% .",
    "the paper is organized as follows ; first , in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we introduce the model of a cnt - based spin valve , and define the concept of a tunnel barrier at the electrode - cnt interface .",
    "next , in sec .",
    "[ sec : tunneling_interface ] we provide a theoretical description of spin injection through the interface and derive the corresponding transmission coefficient for conduction electrons .",
    "this enables us to determine the linear transport through the device as outlined in sec .",

    "[ sec : numerical_results ] , where we discuss both the case of a single ( sec .",
    "[ sec : single_channel ] ) and many ( sec .",
    "[ sec : many_channels ] ) orbital transport channels .",
    "there , we consider in detail the limit of strong tunnel barriers ( sec .",
    "[ sec : strong_barriers ] ) , as well as the situation when a device is characterized by the asymmetric ( sec .",
    "[ sec : asymm_bar ] ) and spin - selective ( sec .",
    "[ sec : spin_sel_bar ] ) barriers .",
    "finally , we conclude the paper in sec .  [",
    "sec : conclusions ] with a discussion about possible implementations of such barriers regarding the essential effects and the general performance to be expected from prospective devices .",
    "a device under consideration consists of two ferromagnetic ( fm ) metallic leads interconnected by a cnt which we approximate as a _ ballistic _ and _ noninteracting _ one - dimensional ( 1d ) quantum wire  @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) .",
    "importantly , at both cnt - lead interfaces a tunnel barrier can form , whose exact shape , generally different for each interface , is unknown .",
    "for this reason , we model scattering of tunneling electrons at the interfaces by means of a _ spin - selective _ repulsive dirac - delta potential @xmath4 for @xmath5 , see fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) .",
    "such an approach has already been shown to suffice in capturing key transport features of the interface  @xcite , but so far has not been systematically applied to analyze how its properties affect one - dimensional spin transport .    .",
    "in the left ( right ) side of ( b ) an example dispersion relation for a fm lead ( cnt around the fermi point k ) is shown . here",
    ", cnp stands for the charge neutrality point with respect to which energy is measured . for a detailed description see sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] . ]    in the model to be analyzed , two identical fm leads are described as a reservoir of non - interacting , itinerant electrons within the stoner model , with the dispersion relation given by @xmath6 here , @xmath7 denotes the stoner splitting , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 represents the fermi energy note that energy @xmath10 is measured relative to the fermi level .",
    "additionally , we assume the effective mass to be equal to the electron s mass , @xmath11 .",
    "generally , in a bulk system with a parabolic dispersion ( i.e. , for the free - electron model ) the spin - dependent density of states ( dos ) @xmath12 at the fermi level ( per unit volume and per spin channel ) is related to the spin - dependent fermi wave vector , @xmath13 , as @xmath14 , as shown in the left side of fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) . with this",
    ", we introduce the _ spin - polarization _",
    "coefficient @xmath15 for the material of which leads are made  @xcite , @xmath16 with the spin index @xmath17 referring now to _ spin - majority _  ( @xmath18 ) and _ spin - minority _  ( @xmath19 ) electrons .",
    "note that the notion of spin - majority / minority electrons becomes useful in the present case , because two different collinear configurations of spin moments of electrodes , that is , parallel  ( p ) and antiparallel  ( ap ) , will be considered .",
    "in particular , the orientation of a spin moment of the left electrode will be kept fixed , so that the relation between spin-`up'/-`down ' electrons and spin - majority/-minority electrons in the left electrode takes the following form @xmath20 this also sets the reference frame for spin orientations of electronic spins in the right electrode . as a result , when a spin moment of the right electrode is parallel / antiparallel with respect to the left one , we get , respectively , @xmath21 and @xmath22 moreover , in the limit of moderate spin polarizations observed in typical materials used for electrodes  @xcite @xmath23 , so that a wave vector can be approximated as @xmath24 $ ] with @xmath25 and , consequently , one can use the following parameterization of the stoner splitting parameter @xmath26 .",
    "note that the above approximation remains valid only for moderate values of the spin polarization of electrodes  ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "next , essential features of a cnt in the vicinity of the fermi point k ( k@xmath28 ) are captured by a dispersion relation  @xcite , @xmath29 typical for 1d conductors  @xcite , with the @xmath30 sign corresponding to conduction / valence band , see the right side of fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : disp_rel_w ] ) @xmath31 stands for the fermi velocity and @xmath32 represents the quantized transverse momentum of a metallic cnt  @xcite , with @xmath33 denoting the radius of a cnt and @xmath34 being the subband index .",
    "as above , the energy @xmath35 is defined relative to the fermi level  @xmath36 .",
    "recall that for an undoped cnt it coincides with the charge neutrality point ( cnp ) , i.e. , @xmath37 , so that only one orbital channel ( @xmath38 ) can contribute to transport at low temperature .",
    "however , due to modification of the immediate environment of a cnt @xmath36 can be shifted by as much as @xmath39  ev  @xcite , and , thus , more channels become available for transport .",
    "the fermi level can be further adjusted by application of an external gate voltage which leads to the shift @xmath40 due to the capacitive coupling between the gate and a cnt  @xcite .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : disp_rel_w ] ) remains valid as long as the variation in @xmath40 is small , that is , the fermi level is moderately shifted around @xmath36 .",
    "it is assumed that transport of electrons along a cnt is ballistic and no mixing of channels occurs .    finally , before we turn to the discussion of electron tunneling through the electrode - cnt interface , we would like to briefly comment on applicability limits of the model under consideration .",
    "we recall that electrodes are here approximated by only free ( @xmath41-band ) electrons , and tunnel barriers are treated as a dirac - delta potential . in fact , the tunnel barrier forming at the electrode - cnt interface can be of much more complex nature , with a potential profile determined by additional factors not included in the present considerations , like the interface roughness and adsorbates  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , materials typically used for electrodes involve transition metals and their alloys , in case of which the free - electron model may be insufficient to capture all key features . in particular , for these materials a more complicated band structure is expected to underlie tunneling of electrons across the interface  @xcite . in order to accommodate fully all these intricacies , that is , the complex electrode - cnt hybridization and the exact morphology of the interface , a model from first principles is needed  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the present approach already shows the great potential of one - dimensional cnt spin valves in the ballistic transport regime with respect to size and tunability of the mr effect .",
    "spin injection across an interface with the band structure mismatch at the fermi energy has already been addressed , e.g. , for fm - metal / metal  @xcite and fm - metal / semiconductor heterojunctions  @xcite . here , we consider a spin - dependent tunneling of electrons through the fm - metal / cnt interface , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) .",
    "the relevant transmission coefficient @xmath42 can be derived by means of standard quantum mechanical methods .",
    "the key problem one has to face is then how to match the wave functions at the interface .",
    "let us focus on the left interface for the moment .",
    "for an ideal interface ( i.e. , without spin - flip and inelastic / interchannel scattering ) the particle current @xmath43 along the @xmath44 axis across the interface has to be conserved in each spin ( @xmath45 ) and orbital ( @xmath46 ) channel .",
    "this basically means that the current in the vicinity of the barrier on its left side , @xmath47 , has to match that on the right side , @xmath48 , namely , @xmath49 with @xmath50 and @xmath51 denoting an infinitesimally small displacement .",
    "close to the interface , on its _ left _ side ( ) , corresponding to a fm metal , this current is given by @xmath52      , \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] whereas on the _ right _ side ( ) , that is , in a cnt , it takes the form @xmath53 with @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) denoting the pauli ( identity ) matrix , and the wave functions @xmath56 and @xmath57 defined as @xmath58 and @xmath59 here , @xmath60 and @xmath61 generally represent the respective probability amplitude for right ( ) and left ( ) moving electrons . inserting eqs .",

    "interestingly , one can note that the same result for @xmath69 can be reached if one used the free - electron model , for which @xmath70      , \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] with the effective mass @xmath71 .",
    "for this reason , the continuity of the current across the @xmath72th interface between a fm lead and a cnt can be ensured by imposing the following boundary conditions for wave functions  @xcite : @xmath73      =      \\sqrt{\\frac{m_n}{m_n^\\ast } }      \\text{tr}\\big [      \\underline{\\bm{\\sigma}}^0      \\bm{\\phi}_{\\sigma n}(z_q )      \\big ]      , \\ ] ] @xmath74      -      \\sqrt{\\frac{m_n}{{m_\\text{e } } } }      \\text{tr}\\big [      \\underline{\\bm{\\sigma}}^0      \\partial_z      \\bm{\\psi}_{\\sigma n}(z)|_{z_q }      \\big ]      \\\\      =      \\frac{2m_nu_\\sigma^q}{\\hbar^2 }      \\sqrt{\\frac{m_n}{m_n^\\ast } }      \\text{tr}\\big [      \\underline{\\bm{\\sigma}}^0      \\bm{\\phi}_{\\sigma n}(z_q )      \\big ]      , \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] with @xmath75 .",

    "the change of transport properties of a spintronic device when switching between the parallel and antiparallel magnetic configuration is generally captured by the tunneling magnetoresistance ( tmr ) @xmath123 if tmr is positive ( negative ) , this basically means that conductance of the device is higher in the parallel ( antiparallel ) magnetic configuration than in the antiparallel ( parallel ) one .    in order to gain better insight into expected effects , first , in sec .",
    "[ sec : single_channel ] , we will consider a conceptually simplest case , that is , with only one orbital channel ( @xmath38 ) available for transport .",
    "such a case remains physically valid as long as the fermi level of a cnt lies in the vicinity of the charge neutrality point , @xmath124 , so that at low temperatures the contribution of orbital channels ( subbands ) with @xmath125 to transport can be neglected , see the right side of fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) .",
    "later on , in sec .",
    "[ sec : many_channels ] , we will abandon this constraint and also discuss the case of many orbital channels by assuming that the fermi level is shifted away from the charge neutrality point .       in the parallel magnetic configuration ( d ) shown as functions of the barrier strngth @xmath126 and the shift of the fermi level due to a gate voltage  @xmath40 in the case of two _ identical _ tunnel barriers at @xmath127  k. here , @xmath128 stands for the period of oscillations .",

    "moreover , the conductance mismatch then essentially means that the transmission coefficient becomes spin - independent .",
    "this problem can be , however , circumvented if a spin - dependent interface resistance ( e.g. , due to a tunnel barrier ) , with some threshold value related to the resistivity and spin diffusion length of a sc , is introduced  @xcite . in the present considerations , on the other hand ,",
    "such an effect is not captured by the model under investigation , that is , a cnt treated as a ballistic 1d conductor . here",
    ", it is assumed that once an electron tunneled into the cnt its spin remains coherent until it tunnels out , which basically corresponds to the situation of both the spin diffusion length and the mean free path being sufficiently long . as shown by valet and fert  @xcite , in such a ballistic limit",
    "the usage of the landauer approach is justified , without the need of applying the description of spin - dependent electrochemical potentials by means of the diffusion equation .",
    "importantly , for that reason , in the current case the spin - dependence is preserved also in the limit of vanishingly small tunnel barrier , and consequently , a non - zero tmr signal is obtained .",
    "we note that a similar effect was also derived for a spin injection into a sc in a ballistic picture  @xcite .      in order to develop the complete physical picture ,",
    "let us now briefly analyze transport in the case of large @xmath126 , which has been already widely studied  @xcite . to begin with , in such a limit one generally derives @xmath164 with @xmath165 where @xmath166 . in the equations above",

    "moreover , in the limit of weakly transparent barriers , @xmath171 , and expanding @xmath172 around the resonant energy @xmath173 , one finds that the expression for the transmission coefficient @xmath174 of the device takes the form of the breit - wigner formula  @xcite @xmath175 in the equation above , @xmath176 and @xmath177 denotes the maximal value of the transmission coefficient at resonance , whereas @xmath178 is the decay width of the resonant level due to tunneling of electrons with spin @xmath45 through the @xmath72th interface .",

    "nevertheless , one can still distinguish three distinctive regions with respect to the barrier strength @xmath126 , whose origin can be explained analogously as in the single - channel case , see sec .  [",

    "[ fig2 ] . ]    next , we analyze how the asymmetry of the strength between left and right barriers ( @xmath204 ) affects the tmr signal . for this purpose ,",
    "we assume that the left barrier is fixed with @xmath199 and we alter the strength of right barrier @xmath198 , see fig .",
    "the cross - section of ( a ) along @xmath312 corresponds then to the cross - section along a thin dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig8](c ) , and represents the case of symmetric barriers . for @xmath314 , which represents the situation of the right barrier being almost fully transparent , one can see softening of tmr features which is accompanied by a smearing out of some resonances , see the relevant lines in fig .",
    "[ fig9](b ) . on the other hand , in the opposite limit ( @xmath315 ) ,",
    "that is , for a strong asymmetry between the barriers with the right barrier of vanishingly small transmission , tmr features become generally much sharper , forming a saw - like pattern , and tmr values vary in a broader range .",
    "interestingly , it can be noticed that peaks and dips developing in tmr evolve from the same features which survive also in the low @xmath198 limit .",
    "in addition , an especially stark contrast between symmetric ( dashed line ) and asymmetric ( thin solid line ) tunnel barriers is seen in the @xmath198 limit under consideration .    ) and the spin asymmetry parameter @xmath229 . _ top panel _ [ ( a)-(b ) ] represents the results for @xmath140 , whereas the _ bottom _ one [ ( c)-(d ) ] for @xmath306 .",
    "plots in the right column contain selected cross - sections of respective density plots from the left column .",
    "solid lines in ( b ) and ( d ) correspond to the situation of barriers being spin - non - selective ( @xmath267 ) .",
    "note , additionally , that the solid line in ( b ) [ ( d ) ] is identical with the solid line for @xmath312 [ dashed line ] in fig .",
    "[ fig9](b ) .",
    "all other parameters as in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] . ]    finally , to make the present discussion complete , we also investigate the effect of spin - selective barriers . since this aspect has been extensively analyzed in sec .",
    "[ sec : spin_sel_bar ] for the case of a single orbital channel , here we focus only on a specific situation of two identical barriers , that is , when @xmath228 and @xmath229 . in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] we show the evolution of tmr as a function of the spin asymmetry parameter @xmath230 and the shift of the fermi level @xmath40 for two representative values of the barrier strength : @xmath140 ( a ) and @xmath306 ( c ) , with selected cross - sections for chosen values of @xmath230 given in ( b ) and ( d ) , respectively .",
    "it can be seen that additional spin filtering of electrons by tunnel barriers can substantially modify the observed tmr . in the limit of large @xmath126 , illustrated in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , it can be noticed that for the off - resonance regions , marked in ( d ) as shaded areas , the tmr suffers significant changes when @xmath230 is appreciably large , while in the resonant regions the observed variation of the tmr effect is more moderate .",
    "moreover , in the former case the dependence of tmr on @xmath230 is described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : tmr_off - res_s ] ) , exactly then same as in the situation of a single orbital channel .",
    "with this paper we provide a complete physical picture of the tmr effect in cnt - based spin valves . in particular , we focus on the influence of the tunnel barrier strength and spin - selectivity of the barrier on the tmr .",
    "the largest tmr signals are generally found in the strong barrier case when the device is tuned to be off - resonant with regard to the fabry - prot resonances in the one - dimensional wire . for a realistic cnt",
    "based spin valve we find a tmr signal of @xmath316 , a value we realized in an recent experiment  @xcite . in general , the off - resonant tmr is more sensitive toward changes in the barriers that the on - resonant tmr .",
    "for instance , the off - resonant tmr increases by @xmath317 if spin - selective barriers are added that prefer majority ( spin - up ) electrons from electrode , while the resonant tmr signal does not change at all .",
    "such a spin - selective barrier might be implemented by spin - selective insulators as eus or euo . however , these materials are likely to couple antiferromagnetically to the ferromagnetic leads . therefore ,",
    "using spin selecting molecules as barrier is believed to be more promising with regard to enhancing the tmr signal , especially since a moderate selectivity of @xmath318 already yields a strong enhancement of the tmr signal up to @xmath245 and double stranded dna has been shown to exhibit high spin filter efficiency  @xcite . using dna as spin filter will require perpendicular orientation of the magnetization of the contacts .",
    "this can be implemented by the right choice contact material and contact shape .",
    "as shown before , the barrier strength in cnt spin valves can be asymmetric due to fabrication resulting in negative values of the tmr signal  @xcite .",
    "we find that it is in principle possible to correct this , if the barrier of the injection contact favors minority ( spin - down ) electrons leading to large positive tmr of up to 50 - 70@xmath319 . in this case , adding an insulating of eus or euo to the lead used for spin injection will likely yield the desired result .",
    "in the case of intermediate barrier strength , i.e. , the potential energy of the barrier matches the energy of the incident electrons at the fermi level , we show that the magnitude of the tmr has a strong response to the gate voltage varying from @xmath320 to @xmath321 within 5 mv gate voltage for a realistic device and without spin - selective barriers .",
    "it is important to note that this tunability of the tmr signal is effective in the absence of spin - orbit coupling , thus preserving the long spin relaxation time inherent for carbon materials .",
    "the tunability of the tmr signal is strongest for asymmetric barriers . adding more transport channels , e.g. , by working at larger gate voltages , the number of resonances increases leading to a less periodic pattern of the tmr with gate voltage .",
    "changes of the tmr signal with respect to barrier strength , asymmetry and spin - selectivity , however , remain qualitatively the same .    in conclusion",
    ", we showed that the feasibility of modification of the tunnel barriers in a controlled way together with electrical tuning of a cnt could open up a possibility to built cnt - based devices exhibiting large tmr effect with strong response to the gate voltage . specifically , a prospective way to achieve",
    "this goal lies in application of highly asymmetric and/or spin - selective tunnel barriers .",
    "this paves the way for spintronic devices that work without spin - orbit coupling and thus preserve long spin relaxation times .",
