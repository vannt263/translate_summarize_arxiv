    "recently , many works related to time optimal quantum computation have appeared in the literature @xcite .",
    "the minimization of physical time to achieve a given unitary transformation should provide a more physical description of the complexity of quantum algorithms . in a series of previous works",
    "@xcite we established a general theory based on the variational principle to find the time optimal evolution between given initial and final pure states @xcite ( paper i ) , and to find the time optimal way of generating a target unitary operation for arbitrary initial states @xcite ( paper ii ) . in paper",
    "i we studied closed pure quantum systems driven by the schrdinger equation and where the hamiltonian is controllable within a certain available set .",
    "paper ii is an extension of paper i and is more relevant to subroutines in quantum computation , where the input may be unknown .",
    "the main result of our works is that , once the constraints for the hamiltonian are given , one can systematically derive a fundamental equation , the _ quantum brachistochrone _ , which can be always solved , at least numerically , for the time optimal hamiltonian ( without any further restricting assumptions , e.g. the adiabaticity of the quantum evolution ) .",
    "here we extend our previous works and formulate a variational principle for the time optimal quantum control of open systems where the dynamics is driven by a master equation in the lindblad @xcite form .",
    "historically , quantum control theory of pure states has been studied by many people ( for a review of the subject , see , e.g. , @xcite ) . around twenty years ago , peirce , dahleh and rabitz @xcite considered a variational method to manufacture a wave packet as close as possible to a given target .",
    "other authors ( see , e.g. , @xcite and other references in @xcite ) further investigated the variational methods by optimizing the fidelity between the final state of the steered system and a given target state . the application to the optimal realization of unitary gates in closed systems",
    "was also studied ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . for the mixed state case ,",
    "the master equation in the lindblad form has been used in @xcite ( for other recent references see , e.g. , @xcite ) . however , while the main concern of these papers was the optimization of the fidelity or the purity of the quantum operations , here we focus the attention on the time optimality .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec - master ] we introduce the markovian approximation and the master equation for an open quantum system and we discuss the related gauge degrees of freedom . in sec .",
    "[ general formalism ] we set up the general variational formalism for the time optimal evolution of such quantum systems .",
    "the action consists of a time cost function to be minimized and of lagrange multiplier terms which ensure the evolution under the master equation and certain constraints for the available hamiltonian and lindblad operators .",
    "we then derive the fundamental equations of motion . in sec .",
    "[ onequbit ] we explicitly demonstrate our methods via the example of a one - qubit system by deriving the time optimal hamiltonian , lindblad and density operators , which may represent either a measurement or a decoherence process . in sec .",
    "[ twoqubits ] we simulate the optimal operations derived in sec .  [ onequbit ] by the partial trace of a two - qubit self - interacting system with a controllable hamiltonian and ancillary qubit .",
    "this corresponds to a repetition of short - time measurements .",
    "[ closedsystem ] , instead , describes the mixed state evolution as a finite time unitary evolution of the system plus an environment followed by a single measurement .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "[ summary ] is devoted to the summary and discussion of our results .",
    "in this paper , we address the problem of time optimal quantum control of open systems where the dynamics is described by a master equation in the lindblad form @xcite @xmath0 + \\sum_a\\left ( l_a\\rho { l^\\dag}_a-\\frac{1}{2}\\{{l^\\dag}_al_a,\\rho\\}\\right ) \\label{master}\\ ] ] for the density operator @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the hamiltonian , @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) are the lindblad operators , @xmath5 is the dimension of the hilbert space of the system and we use the notation @xmath6 for time derivatives , @xmath7:=ab - ba$ ] for the commutator and @xmath8 for the anticommutator .",
    "the hamiltonian represents the unitary evolution part while the lindblad operators express generalized measurements or decoherence processes due to the coupling of the system with an environment .",
    "the master equation is markovian , i.e. , the environment has no memory of the main physical system .",
    "it can be physically realized if the interaction between the main system and the environment is weak and its typical time scale is small compared with that of the physical system  @xcite . a simple example discussed in sec .",
    "v illustrates how the repetition of a short time unitary evolution and the partial trace ( e.g. , measurement ) over the environment states ( [ 2model ] ) reproduces the master equation ( [ master ] ) .",
    "the evolution of @xmath1 is invariant under the following gauge transformations @xmath9 ,    \\nonumber \\\\    & l_a\\mapsto l_a+\\beta_a(t ) ,       \\label{eq - gauge-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a real number , @xmath12 are complex numbers , and the @xmath13 form a unitary matrix with respect to its indices ( i.e. , @xmath14 ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath11 in ( [ eq - gauge-1 ] ) corresponds to the @xmath15 gauge degree of freedom which was discussed in our first papers @xcite for the case of pure states .",
    "the gauge degrees of freedom @xmath12 , instead , correspond to the fact that the operator @xmath2 in ( [ master ] ) is not just the free hamiltonian of the reduced system , but may contain coupling terms with the environment ( see , e.g. , equation ( [ ha ] ) in sec .",
    "v ) . finally , the @xmath13 represent the freedom of the choice of the basis for the hilbert space of the environment .    from the gauge freedom ( [ eq - gauge-1 ] ) , we can always choose @xmath16 , @xmath17 , where a tilde denotes the traceless part of an operator , @xmath18 .",
    "furthermore , by using the degrees of freedom of ( [ eq - gauge-2 ] ) , we can also choose the @xmath19 to be mutually orthogonal .",
    "this is the gauge choice which we make throughout this paper .",
    "let us consider the problem of controlling a certain physical system governed by the master equation ( [ master ] ) and of steering its transition between given initial and final quantum states in the shortest time .",
    "mathematically this is a time optimality problem for the evolution of the density operator @xmath1 according to ( [ master ] ) by controlling the hamiltonian @xmath2 and the lindblad operators @xmath3 .",
    "we assume that at least the ` magnitudes ' of the hamiltonian and of the lindblad operators are bounded .",
    "physically this corresponds to the fact that one can afford only a finite energy in the experiment , and that a finite level of decoherence is tolerated . besides this normalization constraint",
    ", the available operations may be subject also to other constraints , which can represent either experimental requirements ( e.g. , the specifications of the apparatus in use ) or theoretical conditions ( e.g. , allowing no operations involving three or more qubits ) .",
    "we then consider the following action for the dynamical variables @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xmath20,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath21 ,    \\\\    & l_c:=      \\sum_{a}{\\lambda_{a}}f_a(h )       + \\sum_{a , b}\\mu_{ab}[\\operatorname{tr}({l^\\dag}_a l_b)- n\\gamma_a^2\\delta_{ab } ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the traceless hermitian operator @xmath22 , the real functions @xmath23 and the complex functions @xmath24 are lagrange multipliers , and @xmath25 .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , we assume ( even before taking variations of the action ) that @xmath26 and @xmath19 are traceless @xcite , while the second term in @xmath27 is a constraint which ensures the normalization and the mutual orthogonality of the @xmath19 operators .    the @xmath28 term in the action ( [ eq - action ] )",
    "gives the time duration for the evolution of @xmath1 .",
    "the riemannian metric @xmath29 above is assumed to belong to the family of monotone metrics on the space of density operators given by @xmath30 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are multiplication of @xmath33 from the left and right , respectively , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 is an operator - monotone function satisfying @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "the equations of motion derived below actually do not depend on the particular choice of @xmath29 .",
    "in fact , they are the same for all @xmath28 which are constant _ on shell _ ,",
    "i.e. , when the master equation holds ( and one may even choose @xmath37 ) .    the @xmath27 term in ( [ eq - action ] ) generates the constraints @xmath38 and @xmath39 for the hamiltonian and the lindblad operators .",
    "the @xmath40 term in ( [ eq - action ] ) guarantees that @xmath41 satisfies the master equation ( [ master ] ) .",
    "the other equations of motion are derived in the following way . from the variation of @xmath42 by @xmath33 , with the help of ( [ master ] )",
    ", we get the adjoint master equation @xmath43 for @xmath44 , where the superoperator @xmath45 is defined by @xmath46=\\operatorname{tr}[{{{\\cal l}}^\\dag}(a)b]$ ] and its explicit form is @xmath47+\\sum_a({l^\\dag}_aa l_a-\\frac12\\{{l^\\dag}_a l_a , a\\})$ ] .",

    ", we can eliminate the lagrange multipliers to obtain the fundamental _ quantum brachistochrone equation _",
    "@xmath56.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we can thus obtain the time optimal @xmath2 and @xmath3 separately .",
    "one first solves ( [ eq - fund ] ) to obtain the optimal @xmath2 and then solves ( [ master ] ) , ( [ adj_master ] ) , ( [ eq - dh ] ) and ( [ eigen ] ) to find the optimal @xmath3 .",
    "the quantum brachistochrone equation ( [ eq - fund ] ) is the same universal equation as for pure states  @xcite and for unitary operations  @xcite .",
    "it can also be obtained by observing that the first two terms @xmath28 and @xmath40 in the action ( [ eq - action ] ) are invariant under an arbitrary infinitesimal non - abelian transformation @xmath57 ,    { \\nonumber \\\\ } & \\sigma\\mapsto \\sigma+i[{{\\boldsymbol\\chi}}(t),\\sigma ] ,    { \\nonumber \\\\ } & h\\mapsto h+\\dot{{{\\boldsymbol\\chi}}}(t ) - i [ { { \\boldsymbol\\chi}}(t),h ] ,       { \\nonumber \\\\ } & l_a\\mapsto l_a- i [ { { \\boldsymbol\\chi}}(t),l_a ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 .",
    "this is because ( [ eq - non abelian gauge transf ] ) does not change the master equation ( [ master ] ) and the adjoint master equation ( [ adj_master ] ) .",
    "therefore the variation of the entire action reduces to the variation of the constraint term @xmath27 , which is easily checked to produce the quantum brachistochrone equation ( [ eq - fund ] ) .",
    "the same derivation also holds for the case of pure states and unitary operations treated in our previous works @xcite .",
    "let us now discuss as an explicit example a one - qubit model where the hamiltonian is subject only to the normalization constraint @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a given constant . in this case @xmath61 and the quantum brachistochrone equation ( [ eq - fund ] ) becomes trivial , giving @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( see sec .",
    "iii in @xcite ) .",
    "our problem then reduces to that of solving the master equation ( [ master ] ) and the adjoint master equation ( [ adj_master ] ) together with the algebaric equations ( [ eq - dh ] ) and ( [ eigen ] ) for @xmath64 and @xmath65 . in the pauli basis",
    "@xmath66 these can be rewritten as equations for three - dimensional vectors .",
    "namely , if we parametrize the states as @xmath67\\label{systemstate } ,    \\\\ \\sigma'(t)&:=&{{\\boldsymbol{s}}}(t)\\cdot{{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the hamiltonian and the lindblad operators as @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 and @xmath71 , the master equation ( [ master ] ) and the adjoint master equation ( [ adj_master ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath72,\\label{master_v}\\\\ \\!\\ ! \\!\\!\\dot{{{\\boldsymbol{s}}}}&\\!\\!=&\\!\\!2[{{\\boldsymbol{h}}}\\times{{\\boldsymbol{s}}}-\\!\\!\\sum_{{{\\boldsymbol{l}}}\\in\\{{{\\boldsymbol{l}}}_a\\ } }    ( { { \\rm re}}(({{\\boldsymbol{l}}}\\cdot{{\\boldsymbol{s}}}){{\\boldsymbol{l}}}^*)-|{{\\boldsymbol{l}}}|^2{{\\boldsymbol{s}}})].\\label{adj_master_v}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] moreover , the algebraic equations ( [ eq - dh ] ) and ( [ eigen ] ) read @xmath73 and @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the self - adjoint matrix @xmath76 and @xmath77 is a real number .",
    "because of the constraints ( [ normalization ] ) and ( [ hamiltonian_v ] ) , the components of the hamiltonian @xmath78 are given by @xmath79 where @xmath80 is an arbitrary unit vector .",
    "the components of the lindblad operators @xmath81 are determined as eigenvectors of the eigenvalue equation ( [ eigen_v ] ) with the constraints ( [ noise ] ) , i.e. @xmath82 .    at a given instant , we parametrize @xmath83 and @xmath84 as @xmath85 where @xmath86 are orthonormal vectors , so that @xmath87 , with @xmath88 $ ] and @xmath89 $ ] .",
    "we can then rewrite the matrix @xmath90 in ( [ matrixk ] ) as @xmath91.\\ ] ]    if the conserved vector satisfies @xmath92 , we can see @xmath93 ( i.e. @xmath94 ) , and the components of the lindblad operators are given by ( [ eigen_v_matrix ] ) as the following vectors @xmath95 to simplify the analysis , we can move to the interaction picture by the transformation @xmath96 with @xmath97 , so that the master equation ( [ master_v ] ) becomes @xmath98,\\ ] ] which guarantees @xmath99 .",
    "therefore we obtain the following solution for the bloch vector in the interaction picture @xmath100{{\\boldsymbol{e}}}_3.\\ ] ] if the magnitudes of the lindblad operators are equal i.e. @xmath101 , the state will irretrievably lose the coherence , but the coherence can be recovered when the magnitudes of the lindblad operators are different .",
    "note that in this particular case the @xmath102 operator , which corresponds to a projective measurement along @xmath103 , is not effective for the state evolution while the amplitude damping @xmath104 play a significant role in ( [ evol ] ) .",
    "the case @xmath105 is depicted in fig . [ ntos ] .    in the case",
    "when @xmath106 the coupled equations ( [ master_v ] ) , ( [ adj_master_v ] ) and ( [ eigen_v ] ) can be solved numerically .",
    "we depict a family of optimal trajectories from a mixed state to a pure state in the bloch sphere in fig .",
    "2 .    as a final remark for this section",
    ", we would like to point out that , in order to make the time duration of the transition physically well - defined , one can introduce a small but finite error region around the target state .",
    "that is , one can be more interested in reaching the target state with a fixed fidelity close to one .",
    "then , for example , while mathematically it takes an infinite time for the system to reach the target state , the system actually approaches the target state and enters into its small surrounding region in a finite time .",
    "we will show in sec .",
    "vi that in some cases the time optimal mixed state evolution can be faster than the time optimal pure state evolution ( thick solid meridian curve in fig .",
    "1 ) discussed in @xcite .",
    "in particular , if @xmath126 and @xmath127 are parallel ( and chosen to be along the _ z_-axis as at the end of the previous section ) , we can see that it is sufficient to choose the coupling matrix @xmath122 as @xmath128,\\ ] ] with real numbers @xmath129 , and the bloch vector @xmath112 as @xmath130 the lindblad matrix ( [ aij ] ) becomes @xmath131.\\ ] ] then the @xmath90 matrix ( [ eigen_v_matrix ] ) for @xmath93 , @xmath132,\\ ] ] and the lindblad matrix @xmath133 can be diagonalized simultaneously .",
    "in particular , the eigenvalues of @xmath133 are @xmath134 and the corresponding eigenvectors are given as in ( [ clindblad1 ] ) and ( [ clindblad2 ] ) , with the magnitudes of the lindblad operators @xmath135    the optimal solution for @xmath83 can be finally cast in the form @xmath136{{\\boldsymbol{e}}}_3.\\ ] ] an intuitive explanation for the behavior of the bloch vector is the following .",
    "the exponential damping in ( [ damping ] ) can be attributed to the standard formula for the transition probability calculated from the interaction hamiltonian @xmath137 note that @xmath138 does not appear in ( [ damping ] ) so that it can be put equal to zero .",
    "suppose now that the @xmath108 spin is up , i.e. @xmath139 . since the interaction hamiltonian ( [ hab2 ] ) is proportional to @xmath140 , both the system and the ancilla spins tend to align down .",
    "suppose we start with the completely mixed state @xmath141 .",
    "in the statistical interpretation of the density operator , this means that in half of the systems the spin is up while in the other half the spin is down .",
    "the up components are steered down while the down components remain unchanged , so that eventually the state of the system evolves from a completely mixed state to a purely down state .",
    "this kind of ` cooling ' has been already discussed before @xcite . on the other hand , for @xmath142 ,",
    "the system approaches a completely mixed state regardless of the initial conditions , as we expect because the system is kept into contact with the completely random state of the ancilla , @xmath143 .",
    "this corresponds to decoherence .",
    "we would like to remark that , although the coupling parameters @xmath122 and the ancilla state are constant , in our particular parallel @xmath126 and @xmath127 case , they can be time dependent in general .",
    "this particular demonstration of a simple two qubit model suffices to illustrate the physics behind the master equation in the lindblad form .",
    "so far we have considered the situation in which the evolution of mixed states is the result of a series of short time unitary operations each followed by a measurement .",
    "however , the evolution of mixed states can be also described by a finite time unitary evolution in an enlarged hilbert space for the original system plus an environment followed by the trace over the environment , which is equivalent to a final measurement only . in this section",
    "we are going to study in more details this single measurement strategy and the dependence of the optimal duration time of the evolution on the size of the environment .    to be more explicit ,",
    "let us consider a set of @xmath144-qubits in which the first qubit is regarded as the system and the rest is the environment .",
    "the whole closed system is then governed by the schrdinger equation with a controllable hamiltonian @xmath2 and the evolution of the first qubit can be expressed as @xmath145 where @xmath146 is the initial state of the environment and @xmath147 .",
    "let us assume that there are no other restrictions for the system except the normalization conditions ( [ noise ] ) and ( [ normalization ] ) for the lindblad and the hamiltonian operators , respectively .",
    "now , to justify the dependence of ( [ normalization ] ) for the traceless hamiltonian on the dimension @xmath5 ( for @xmath144 qubits , @xmath148 ) of the hilbert space over which it acts , we note that @xmath149 is required by the invariance under the trivial extension @xmath150 , i.e. @xmath151 .",
    "this is because the physical properties of the system described by @xmath26 should not change even if we add an extra ancillary environment of arbitrary dimension @xmath152 which is not interacting with the system .",
    "a simliar argument applies to the lindblad operators . in particular",
    ", the constraints should be invariant under the trivial extension of the hilbert space .",
    "this simple observation is crucial to obtain the correct relation between the size of the environment and the optimal duration time of the evolution .",
    "the same point will also become important in addressing the efficiency of quantum computation and its scaling properties when we apply our formalism to explicit quantum algorithms @xcite .",
    "therefore , the quantum brachistochrone equation ( [ eq - fund ] ) leads to a time independent optimal hamiltonian for the whole closed system which , without any loss of generality , can be chosen as @xmath153 where the states @xmath154 and @xmath155 are the states @xmath156 and @xmath157 , respectively , in the binary representation . the time evolution of the whole system is driven by the unitary matrix @xmath158 suppose now that we want to steer the first qubit from the state @xmath159 up to the target state @xmath160 .",
    "then , assuming that @xmath161 , from ( [ trace - out ] ) and ( [ u ] ) we obtain @xmath162 , \\label{wave}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so that the time required to reach the target state is @xmath163 which is faster than the pure state case , where the time - optimal evolution from @xmath164 to @xmath165 under the same constraint takes the time @xmath166 @xcite .",
    "we conclude the section by stressing the fact that the optimal duration time ( [ normalization1 ] ) is an exponentially decreasing function of the number of the ancilla qubits of the environment .",
    "we have developed a framework based on the variational principle for finding the time optimal quantum operation to make a transition between given initial and final states @xmath167 and @xmath168 , when the physical system obeys a markovian master equation in the lindblad form .",
    "the equations of motion for the hamiltonian @xmath26 and the lindblad operators @xmath19 can be written down once the constraints for @xmath26 and @xmath19 are specified according to the problem .",
    "one then obtains the time optimal operation @xmath169 and the optimal duration time @xmath170 by solving the quantum brachistochrone and the other equations of motion and imposing the initial and final conditions @xmath171 and @xmath172 .",
    "our formalism for the mixed state case has been explicitly demonstrated with a one - qubit model .",
    "first , the optimal hamiltonian was obtained from the quantum brachistochrone equation .",
    "then the time evolution of the density operator and of the lindblad operators which represent an optimal measurement or decoherence was found from a remaining set of ordinary differential and algebraic equations . in a particular case",
    "an analytical solution was given , while the solution for more general situations was shown numerically .",
    "to get a more physical intuition , we constructed an interacting two - qubit model where an ancilla qubit plays the role of the environment and we demonstrated that repeated short - time markovian transitions can reproduce the optimal time evolution of mixed states .",
    "next we considered the time optimal evolution of mixed states driven by a single final measurement after the unitary evolution in an enlarged hilbert space . in this case",
    "the optimal duration time is an exponentially decreasing function of the number of the qubits of the environment .",
    "let us compare the efficiency of the time optimal evolutions between given initial and final pure states for the two models of repeated markovian measurements and that of a final measurement following a unitary evolution in an extended hilbert space .",
    "0.75 cm    in fig .",
    "3 we plot the fidelity between the target pure state and the time optimal evolved mixed state as a function of the duration time of the evolution .",
    "we can see that , for a given fidelity close to one , the evolution via a final measurement becomes more and more efficient ( i.e. , it takes a shorter time ) than the evolution via a repetition of measurements as the number of qubits in the environment increases .",
    "this is because with an environment more resources are available for the processing of the information required to generate the time optimal evolution .",
    "incidentally , we note that both the dynamical evolution law ( [ master ] ) ( or , equivalently , ( [ 2model ] ) ) and ( [ trace - out ] ) can be also expressed as a completely positive , trace preserving map @xmath173 , i.e. @xmath174 , where the @xmath175 are the kraus operators , which satisfy @xmath176 .",
    "in particular , the relation between the lindblad operators in ( [ master ] ) and the kraus operators is explicitly given by @xmath177 and @xmath178 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "our work has not dealt with the more general case of different duration times for the contacts between the system and the environment and the case of the possible memory feed - back from the environment itself .",
    "the authors of @xcite also considered the problem of control in dissipative quantum dynamics in order to achieve optimal purification of a quantum state , but they worked within the standard framework of a set of constant lindblad operators .",
    "furthermore , although there should be no conceptual difficulty in extending our work to the problem of optimal quantum control via quantum feedback by introducing a stochastic term in the master equation @xcite , we have not discussed this problem here .",

    "<S> we present a general formalism based on the variational principle for finding the time - optimal quantum evolution of mixed states governed by a master equation , when the hamiltonian and the lindblad operators are subject to certain constraints . </S>",
    "<S> the problem reduces to solving first a fundamental equation ( the _ quantum brachistochrone _ ) for the hamiltonian , which can be written down once the constraints are specified , and then solving the constraints and the master equation for the lindblad and the density operators . as an application of our formalism , </S>",
    "<S> we study a simple one - qubit model where the optimal lindblad operators control decoherence and can be simulated by a tunable coupling with an ancillary qubit . it is found that the evolution through mixed states can be more efficient than the unitary evolution between given pure states . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the mixed state evolution as a finite time unitary evolution of the system plus an environment followed by a single measurement . for the simplest choice of the constraints , the optimal duration time for the evolution </S>",
    "<S> is an exponentially decreasing function of the environment s degrees of freedom . </S>"
