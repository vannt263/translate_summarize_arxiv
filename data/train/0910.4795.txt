    "the relevance of two types of self - similarity , ` original ' self - similarity and topological self - similarity , has been considered in ramification analysis @xcite .        the number of leaves of a binary tree is called _ magnitude _ , and let @xmath6 denote the set of topologically different binary trees of magnitude @xmath7 .",

    "polynomial and rational functions are typical examples of such functions , and as shown in the previous section , important random variables on the horton - strahler analysis are mostly polynomial or rational functions of @xmath106",
