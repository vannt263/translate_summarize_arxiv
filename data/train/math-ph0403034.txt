    "since the discovery of strong magnetic fields in astronomical objects , e.g. , in the surface of neutron stars , the behaviour of atoms and molecules in these media has become a subject of wide interest .",
    "also , high - magnetic - field conditions can be mimicked in some semiconductors where a small effective electron mass @xmath2 and a large dielectric constant @xmath3 reduce the coulomb force relative to the magnetic force @xcite . for a review and references",
    "see @xcite .",
    "in particular , the hydrogen molecular ion @xmath4 , has been studied under the influence of a strong magnetic field in the last 25 years , see e.g. , @xcite for some references , using variational and numerical techniques .",
    "this system , as the simplest molecule in nature , can exhibit a qualitative behaviour of the internuclear separation as a function of the magnetic field that could have applications to the study of more complex molecular systems .",
    "we consider @xmath0 , in a constant magnetic field .",
    "we use the born - oppenheimer approximation , with @xmath5 and @xmath6 the electric charge and the mass of the electron , respectively . in gaussian units",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the coulomb potential due to the nuclei , and @xmath9 the internuclear separation . here",
    "@xmath10 and @xmath11 is the magnetic vector potential .    in this static situation",
    "it is convenient to use the coulomb gauge @xmath12 , and the choice @xmath13 .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath14 is taken parallel to the unit vector @xmath15 of the nuclear axis , which is the energetically most favorable situation @xcite .",
    "the criterium to define the strong magnetic field regime is to ask for a gap between landau levels bigger than an energy of the order of the ionization energy of the hydrogen atom .",
    "this means @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the cyclotron frequency and @xmath18  , the bohr radius .",
    "that gives us the threshold value of @xmath19 , @xmath20 the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath21,\\ ] ] where @xmath22 choosing atomic units , i.e. , @xmath23 , the hamiltonian reads @xmath24 where @xmath25    in this system of units , the magnetic field is measured in units of @xmath26 , the energy in units of @xmath27 hartree @xmath28 [ ev ] and the separation @xmath9 in units of @xmath29 [  ] .",
    "moreover , using cylindrical coordinates ( i.e. , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) , @xmath33",
    "in order to diagonalize @xmath34 , we use that @xmath35=[h , s_z]=[l_z , s_z]=0 $ ] and the spectral decompositions    @xmath36    to get a diagonal matrix @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 . here",
    "@xmath40 denotes the projector of the @xmath41 eigenvalue of @xmath42 .",
    "the ground state belongs to @xmath43 in the spin sector and to @xmath44 in the @xmath45 sector , assuming that the result of @xcite applies also to @xmath4 .",
    "so , we take the term @xmath46 where @xmath47 . using the projectors of the spectral decomposition of @xmath48 we can write @xmath49 in a matrix form as follows @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and @xmath53 the projector over the lowest landau level .",
    "the  effective \" part of our hamiltonian , which is the physically relevant , @xmath54 , can be written as @xmath55 with @xmath56 since @xmath57 projects onto the wave function @xmath58 making the change of variable , @xmath59 we get @xmath60 with @xmath61    in the sequel we present some necessary mathematical results which will appear in full elsewhere @xcite .",
    "let @xmath62 be the unitary implementation of the scaling @xmath63 and define the scaled matrix as @xmath64 .",
    "its singular part reads @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67    if we consider the resolvents @xmath68 and @xmath69 where @xmath70 we can show that @xcite @xmath71 with @xmath72 , the resolvent of @xmath73 , and @xmath74 and @xmath75 are some positive constants .",
    "the appropriate scaling law for @xmath76 in terms of the magnetic field is given by @xmath77 , where @xmath78 denotes the lambert function ( for more information about this function see @xcite ) .",
    "this relationship between @xmath76 and the magnetic field @xmath19 is the correct scaling law to insure the convergence of the resolvents of the two different models which follows from the proof of the key theorem in @xcite .",
    "such a resolvent estimate implies , in particular , that the ground state of @xmath79 , our scaled hamiltonian , is asymptotic to @xmath80 , the ground state of @xmath81 , when the magnetic field tends to infinity .",
    "in what follows , we will compute the ground state of @xmath82 perturbatively from the asymptotic model @xmath83 .",
    "the ground state energy , @xmath80 , of @xmath83 is given by    @xmath84    where @xmath85 . here",
    "@xmath86 is the solution of the equation @xmath87 which can be expressed as ( [ eq22 ] ) , in terms of the lambert function @xmath88 .",
    "since the hamiltonians @xmath79 and @xmath83 are invariant under parity and since the ground state is even , it is convenient to work from here on in @xmath89 .",
    "this being the case , the ground state of @xmath83 in @xmath90 reads ,    @xmath91    with @xmath92 and @xmath93    we set    @xmath94    to second order in perturbation theory , the ground state energy of @xmath82 is given by @xcite    @xmath95    where @xmath96 is the projector over @xmath97 and @xmath98 is the corresponding reduced resolvent .",
    "the free kernel is given by    @xmath99    and we use the notation @xmath100 .",
    "let @xmath101 be the free kernel evaluated at @xmath102 , and correspondingly we let @xmath103 be @xmath104 evaluated at @xmath102 . using this notation ,",
    "the kernel of the reduced resolvent at @xmath105 is given by    @xmath106    with @xmath107    therefore , we can compute for each @xmath19 and @xmath9 the energy of the molecule @xmath4 in a magnetic field , now including the scaling and the repulsion energy , using the expression @xmath108    the minimum of @xmath109 as a function of @xmath9 , determines the equilibrium distance between the nuclei as well as the binding energy , which is defined as this minimum .",
    "we set @xmath110 , where @xmath111 denotes the equilibrium distance .",
    "we have computed , with mathematica @xcite , the equilibrium distance and binding energy of the @xmath4 molecule using second order perturbation theory , for a wide range of magnetic fields . using the high level language of mathematica ,",
    "our program to compute @xmath112 is simply a transcription in this language of the mathematical formula ( 25 ) , ( 29 ) and ( 31 ) .",
    "simple and double integrals are made with the numerical integration of mathematica using the gauss - kronrod method option .",
    "plotting @xmath113 we are able to locate @xmath111 and finally to compute @xmath114 . in tables",
    "i , ii , iii and iv , we compare our results for the binding energy and internuclear separation , respectively , with those found by de melo et al .",
    "@xcite ( using variational techniques ) , le guillou et al .",
    "@xcite , lai et al .",
    "@xcite and heyl et al .",
    "@xcite , respectively . in figures 1 and 2 we plot the binding energy , and in figure 3 we plot the internuclear equilibrium distance , both against the natural scaling of these quantities , i.e. , @xmath115 for the binding energy and @xmath76 for the internuclear distance . finally , in figure 4 we see that the product @xmath116 is monotonically decreasing as @xmath19 increases .",
    "so far we have discussed the behavior of the ground state of @xmath4 for large magnetic fields . in this section",
    "we will consider homonuclear diatomic molecules with one electron but with nuclear charge not necessarily one .",
    "we are interested on the stability of these molecules as a function of @xmath117 and @xmath19 . in particular",
    ", we are interested in determining the highest value of @xmath117 for which a diatomic molecule of this sort may exist , as a function of the strength of the magnetic field .",
    "we have not try to go beyond realistic values of @xmath19 , i.e. @xmath118 .",
    "we will use the same model as the one discussed above but this time with nuclear charge @xmath117 . in order to take into account the explicit dependence of the model on @xmath117",
    "we must change @xmath119 to @xmath120 and @xmath121 to    @xmath122    and , correspondingly , the second order perturbation theory expression for the energy of the system is given by    @xmath123.\\ ] ]    here @xmath124 is given , as before , by ( [ eq : el - en ] ) , but with the appropriate changes in @xmath125 .    in the case of zero magnetic field",
    ", it was shown numerically by hogreve @xcite , that a homonuclear diatomic molecule with one electron exists as long as @xmath117 is below @xmath126 . from our calculations here",
    "( see table v below ) we see that the magnetic field enhances the binding properties of this molecular ion .",
    "the maximum @xmath117 for which a homonuclear diatomic molecule with one electron exists , is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath19 . concerning our notation in table v , below @xmath127 we have a bound state of the molecule . between @xmath127 and @xmath128",
    "we have only a local minimum , i.e. , a resonance . above @xmath128",
    ", we have no minimum for the potential energy curve @xmath129 , see ( [ eq29 ] ) , at finite values of @xmath9 .",
    "applying perturbation theory to a solvable model , we have computed the binding energy and the internuclear separation for the @xmath4 molecule in the presence of a strong magnetic field .",
    "our results are in good agreement with those found in the literature for a wide range of the magnetic field .",
    "we also give the critical nuclear charge for the stability of diatomic molecules with one electron in a strong magnetic field .",
    "we remark that for magnetic fields about @xmath130 gauss , we can find a diatomic molecule with one electron with a nuclear charge @xmath131 , which is a new atomic system .",
    "finally , we note that one advantage of perturbation theory on variational methods is to give the possibility of computing numerically a window which contains the exact value of the ground state energy @xmath132 of the effective hamiltonian @xmath133 . in other words to produce lower bounds on @xmath132 whereas variational methods are not good at that . even using ( 21 )",
    "we may compute these windows for the ground state energy of the complete hamiltonian @xmath34 .",
