    "technological importance of nanowire structures on silicon substrates has generated much interest in studying structural arrangements of metals on various si substrates .",
    "@xcite in particular , metals like al , ga and in at sub - monolayer coverages on the si(001 ) surface have been examined @xcite for the formation of stable atomic wires on surfaces .",
    "though , stable atomic wire structures have not been found on the bare si(001 ) surface , there has been some progress @xcite towards the formation of stable atomic wires on the patterned hydrogen terminated si(001 ) surface .",
    "recently , the vicinal si surfaces have attracted much attention for the growth of self assembled atomic wires on them .",
    "the si(211 ) surface @xcite is one of the vicinal si surfaces that is being widely used by experimentalists @xcite as a substrate for growing atomic wire structures .",
    "this surface can be viewed as a stepped arrangement of narrow ( 111 ) terraces .    a three dimensional view of a small portion of the ideal si(211 ) surface is shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the atoms marked t ( called the terrace atoms ) on the terrace are three - fold coordinated and thus have one dangling bond each ; those on the step edge , marked e ( called the edge atoms ) are two - fold coordinated and have two dangling bonds each .",
    "second layer si atoms which are not directly bonded either with terrace or edge atoms are denoted as tr ( called the trench atoms ) have one dangling bond each .",
    "the si(211 ) surface consists of two - atom wide terraces between terrace and edge atoms along the [ @xmath4 direction .",
    "two consecutive terraces are separated by steps and are 9.4    apart in the [ @xmath4 direction , while they extend infinitely along [ @xmath5 .",
    "the reason for using si(211 ) is that the metals are expected to nucleate at the step edges , and form atomic nanowires .    the scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) images obtained by baski et al .",
    "@xcite for the ga / si(211 ) system showed the formation of atomic wires of ga extending along the [ @xmath5 direction with vacancies at every fifth or sixth atoms interval _",
    "i.e. _ , the surface structure becomes @xmath6n with n=5 - 6 .",
    "the ga wires were separated by 9.4    along the [ @xmath4 direction .",
    "these authors also provided a theoretical model supporting their experimental observations .",
    "the same system was also studied by gonzalez et al .",
    "@xcite and their stm images revealed the formation of two atomic chains of ga extending along the [ @xmath5 direction within the 9.4    distance along the [ @xmath4 direction .",
    "they also found that both the chains have vacancies at six atoms interval along the [ @xmath5 direction _",
    "i.e. _ , the surface structure is @xmath7 .",
    "the authors , in addition , performed a detailed theoretical calculations in support of their experimental results . from the experimental and theoretical results for ga / si(211 ) ,",
    "it is clear that a stable uninterrupted ga chain can not be formed on the si(211 ) substrate .",
    "the in / si(211 ) system has also been studied experimentally by means of stm , low energy electron diffraction ( leed ) and auger electron spectroscopy ( aes ) .",
    "it is found that the surface pattern is @xmath8 .",
    "@xcite they also presented an intuitive model in support of their results .",
    "wang et al .",
    "@xcite performed leed experiments on the al / si(211 ) at sub - monolayer coverage and they found the surface pattern to be @xmath7 .",
    "the question we raise here is whether or not a stable uninterrupted atomic al chain may be formed on the si(211 ) substrate . since",
    ", no detailed electronic structure calculations have so far been made for the precise atomic arrangements of al on the si(211 ) surface , the possibility of formation of a stable continuous al wire on si(211 ) is also worth investigating . in this paper",
    "we therefore perform extensive total energy calculations for the al / si(211 ) system .    from theoretical perspective",
    "it is important to know the reconstruction of the clean surface prior to the placement of any metal on the surface .",
    "as far as the reconstruction of the clean si(211 ) surface is concerned , there have been several studies @xcite",
    ". however , baski et al .",
    "@xcite found ( using stm ) that the clean si(211 ) is really unstable and consists of nanofacets with ( 111 ) and ( 337 ) orientations .",
    "it has also been shown that the si(211 ) orientation is regained upon metal adsorption.@xcite in view of this result ,",
    "@xcite we therefore consider the ideal bulk terminated si(211 ) substrate for the al atomic wires study . in our investigations , we systematically increase al coverage on the si(211 ) surface and see how the adsorption sites and the surface structure change as we go towards a monolayer ( ml ) coverage .",
    "we will show that atomic arrangement of al on si(211 ) will depend on the chemical potential of al ( @xmath9 ) which in turn depends on the experimental conditions such as the substrate temperature , the al vapor pressure in the effusion cell and the al vapor pressure on the substrate .",
    "our study reveals that the interrupted al chains with period five / six ( similar to the case of ga ) may be formed .",
    "however , most significant result in this investigation is that a stable uninterrupted al chain extending along the [ @xmath5 direction assisted by an interrupted chain can be formed at about 1 ml coverage .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : method ] we present the parameters used in the pseudopotential density functional calculations .",
    "the results and discussions are presented in section  [ sec : results ] .",

    "total energy minimization calculations are carried out within the density functional theory ( dft ) in conjunction with the pseudopotential approximation .",
    "the si(211 ) surface is represented in a repeated slab geometry .",
    "each slab contains seven si(211 ) layers with a vacuum region of 12  . for example , in the @xmath13 super - cell , each layer contains eight si atoms : two along [ @xmath10 and four along [ @xmath14 . the top layer ( within the 1@xmath154 super - cell ) contains four edge and four terrace si atoms . it is noted that in an ideal si(211):@xmath16 surface each layer consists of two distinct atoms .",
    "the si atoms in the bottom layers have their dangling bonds saturated by hydrogen atoms ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) . since the edge atoms have two dangling bonds each , the trench atoms have one dangling bond each and the terrace atoms have one dangling bond each , we require sixteen hydrogen atoms to saturate all the dangling bonds at the bottom of the slab in the @xmath13 super - cell . we have used super - cells of various sizes ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 ) in our calculations .",
    "the top five si layers are relaxed for geometry optimization while the two lower - most si layers and the hydrogen atoms are held fixed to simulate the bulk - like termination .",

    "( bz ) integration is performed within a monkhorst - pack ( mp ) @xcite scheme using four inequivalent k - points .",
    "it has been established earlier @xcite that the energy cutoff , the set of k - points , the number of layers in the slab and the amount of vacuum region considered here give sufficiently converged values for total energies .",
    "ionic potentials are represented by vanderbilt - type ultra - soft pseudopotentials  @xcite and results are obtained using generalized gradient approximation ( gga )  @xcite for the exchange - correlation potential .",
    "preconditioned conjugate gradient is used for wave function optimization and a conjugate gradient for ionic relaxations .",

    "the numerals 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 indicate identical sites displaced along the y direction in the super - cell .",
    "for example , g1 , g2 , g3 and g4 ( groove sites ) are identical sites displaced by 3.84    along the y direction in the super - cell.,title=\"fig:\",width=240 ] +",
    "the structures and energetics for al on the si(211 ) surface at 1/8 , 1/4 , 1/2 and beyond 1/2 ml coverages are systematically analyzed here to examine the formation of al atomic wires on the si(211 ) substrate .",
    "note that one monolayer corresponds to one atom per si atom on the top layer of the ideal bulk terminated surface leading to @xmath23 atoms/@xmath24 .      here",
    "we discuss the structure and energetics of al at 1/8 ml coverage and hence we need to place one al atom on the surface of @xmath25 super - cell . at such a low coverage",
    "the al atoms are practically isolated from each other on the surface .",
    "the si(211 ) surface offers various kinds of sites for al to bind .",
    "based on the symmetry and available dangling bonds on the surface , we consider all the probable binding sites which are designated as g , v , m , and f sites respectively in fig .  [ fig2 ] .",
    "we use numerals 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 to label identical sites displaced by 3.84    along the @xmath26 $ ] direction in the super - cell .",
    "for example , g1 , g2 , g3 and g4 ( g sites ) are identical sites displaced by 3.84    along the @xmath26 $ ] direction in the super - cell .",
    "the binding energies ( be ) of the al atom at different kinds of sites are given in table [ table1 ] .",
    "the binding energy of the al atom is defined as be = -@xmath27 $ ] where e(al+si ) , e(si ) and @xmath28 are total energy of al adsorbed super - cell , total energy of the super - cell without al and atomic energy of al respectively .    from table [ table1 ] , we notice that a g site ( be=4.53 ev ) is most favorable for al adsorption followed by a f site ( be=4.45 ev ) , and a v site ( be=4.31 ev ) respectively .",
    "binding energy of al at a v site is close to that at a m site . in our calculations , we let the al atom ( except at v sites ) relax in all directions so as to reach the local energy minimum .",
    "for v site , the al atom is allowed to relax both along y and z directions .",
    "it is reasonable that the al atom favors to bind at a site where it can satisfy itself by sharing charges with three neighboring si atoms . at a g site",
    "the al atom is surrounded by two edge si atoms and one trench si atom .",
    "the distance of the al atom ( at a g site ) from the nearest edge si atoms are @xmath29 2.6    and that from the nearest trench si atom is also @xmath29 2.6  . on the other hand",
    ", the al atom at the f site also shares its charge with three si neighbors and the al - si bonds at those sites are equally strong as that at a g site .",
    "for example , the distances of the al atom at a f site from its neighboring terrace and two trench si atoms are 2.6   , 2.5    and 2.5    respectively .",
    "furthermore , the charge density plot in fig .  [ fig3 ] clearly shows that the al atom at both the g and f sites makes strong bonds with three neighboring si atoms .",
    "we also notice that the edge si atoms form dimers irrespective of the position of the al atom at a g site or a f site . however , as the al atom forms bonds with the neighboring si atoms , it introduces strain in the underlying lattice . therefore the net energy gain due to al adsorption",
    "will also depend on the amount of strain introduced by the al atom during the process of forming bonds with the neighboring si atoms . from fig .",
    "3(b ) it is evident that one of the edge si dimers in the super - cell is distorted due to the strain introduced by the al atom adsorbed at a f site . as a whole",
    ", a g site turns out to be most favorable .",
    "the net energy gain in this process is the difference between the binding energy of al at a g site and its chemical potential , @xmath30e = ( be - @xmath31 ) @xmath29 0.85 ev , where @xmath32 ev is the bulk chemical potential for aluminum .",
    "however , in practice , the energy gain will be less than 0.85 ev as the bulk chemical potential is the upper bound of @xmath2 .",
    "in other words , a maximum of @xmath33 ev is gained by adsorbing an al atom at a g site .",
    "our calculations show that the adsorption of al atom on the terrace site is not possible because one needs to supply an energy of @xmath29 1 ev to place an al atom on the terrace si atom .",
    "we also studied the energetics for the replacement of terrace , trench and edge si atoms by al atoms .",
    "our results indicate that replacement of trench and edge si atoms by al atoms are energetically not possible , while an energy of 0.5 ev is gained due to the replacement of a single terrace si atom by an al atom .",
    "we note that the chemical potential for si ( @xmath34 ) is taken to be the bulk value @xmath29 -5.43 ev .",
    "this information will be useful in the later part of our discussion at higher coverages of al .",

    "a continuous chain lying between the trench and edge sites produces strain in the system which may be relieved by forming vacancies along the chain ( like ga @xcite ) .",

    "since the surface structure and the arrangement of al atoms on the si(211 ) depends on @xmath59 which again depends on the experimental conditions , the observed surface structure upon al deposition will depend on the experimental conditions .",

    "11(b ) , indicates that the band structure for the surface consisting of only interrupted al chains with period @xmath60 ( one of the favorable structures for 0.3 ev @xmath62 0.5 ev ) is semiconducting in nature .",
    "we therefore conclude that below 1 ml al coverage the si(211 ) surface may be metallic or semiconducting in nature depending on the experimental conditions while the ga covered si(211 ) surface is only semiconducting in nature @xcite .",
    "however , like ga / si(211 ) an experimental study of al / si(211 ) is desirable .",

    ", we find that though the average binding energy per al decreases slowly with increase of the coverage , the favorable sites change dramatically .",
    "for example at 1/8 ml coverage the al atoms favors to bind at the groove ( g ) sites with an average binding energy @xmath29 4.52 ev and at 1/4 ml coverage al atoms prefers to bind at m sites with an average binding energy @xmath29 4.43 ev . however , around 1/2 ml coverage al atoms prefer to nucleate at the groove sites to form chain structure extending along the y[@xmath5 direction with an interruption by a vacancy at regular intervals ( with vacancy period 5 or 6 ) . as the coverage increases further , the replacement process comes into play , _",
    "i.e. _ , the terrace si atoms are replaced by the al atoms to form an uninterrupted / interrupted al chain along the terrace sites in addition to the presence of the interrupted al chain along the groove sites .",
    "a detailed analysis of our results reveals that for @xmath63 ev , only interrupted al chain along the groove sites with a vacancy period of five will be formed and for 0.3 ev @xmath64 0.5 ev interrupted al chains with vacancy period five / six will be formed both along the terrace and groove sites .",

    "we note that the experimentally observed @xmath1 surface pattern for al / si(211 ) corresponds to one of the favorable structures presented here within the 0 ev @xmath62 0.5 ev .",
    "a novel finding is that an uninterrupted al chain may be formed on si(211 ) unlike the case of ga and in on si(211 ) .",
    "furthermore , the al covered si(211 ) surface may be metallic or semiconducting in nature depending on the experimental conditions , while the ga covered si(211 ) surface is only semiconducting in nature below 1 ml coverage .",
    "one would expect that since al ( @xmath66 ) and ga ( @xmath67 ) belong to the same column of the periodic table , they should manifest similar physical and chemical properties .",
    "this is certainly true at a gross level but their behavior at surfaces can be very different due to differences in lattice constants but more significantly due to major differences in their cohesive energies .",
    "it should be noted that cohesive energy of al ( @xmath29 4 ev ) is at least @xmath29 0.5 ev larger ( more strongly bound by this amount ) than for ga . when it comes to binding on surfaces of other materials ,",
    "there is a competition between cohesion and bonding and hence it is not surprising that al and ga may stabilize in different configurations on si(211 ) .",
    "the stm experiments on the al / si(211 ) system will be helpful in revealing both the continuous and interrupted al wire structures .",

    "<S> possibility for the formation of stable al atomic wire on the si(211 ) surface is investigated using density functional theory based total energy calculations . the stable adsorption sites and the surface structures at various sub - monolayer coverages of al </S>",
    "<S> are presented . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the most stable and natural surface structures around one monolayer coverage is either @xmath0 or @xmath1 which agrees with experimental observations . </S>",
    "<S> more significantly , our study revealed that unlike the case of ga the formation of continuous atomic al chains assisted by interrupted al chains may be possible by controlling the experimental conditions ( pressure and temperature ) such that the @xmath2 remains within @xmath3 ev from the bulk value . while the al covered si(211 ) surface may be metallic or semiconducting , the ga covered si(211 ) is always semiconducting in nature below 1 ml coverage . </S>",
    "<S> also significant is the fact that al atoms move from groove sites to the sites between terrace and trench atoms through lower energy channels as the coverage goes from 1/8 monolayer to 1/4 monolayer . </S>"
