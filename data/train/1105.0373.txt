    "since nontrivial models in statistical mechanics are rarely exactly solvable , monte carlo ( mc ) simulations have become a standard tool for obtaining information on phase diagrams and critical exponents @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , mc simulations typically suffer from severe _ critical slowing - down _",
    "@xcite , so that the computational efficiency tends rapidly to zero as the critical point is approached .",
    "more precisely , the autocorrelation ( relaxation ) time @xmath11 diverges in the critical limit , most often like @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the spatial correlation length .",
    "the dynamic critical exponent @xmath14 depends on both the model being investigated and the mc algorithm being used . for local algorithms one typically has @xmath15 .",

    "more precisely , one introduces a joint probability distribution @xcite of spin and bond variables , whose marginal on the spins ( integrating out the bonds ) is the potts spin model and whose marginal on the bonds ( integrating out the spins ) is the fk random - cluster model @xcite ; one then updates this joint distribution by alternately applying the two conditional distributions ( see section  [ subsec.sw ] below for details ) .",
    "since a local move in one set of variables can have highly nonlocal effects in the other , it is not surprising that the sw algorithm might have less critical slowing - down than the conventional local algorithms . and",
    "this is in fact the case : although the sw algorithm does not eliminate critical slowing - down , it does radically reduce it compared to local algorithms .",
    "much effort has therefore been devoted , for both theoretical and practical reasons , to understanding the dynamic critical behavior of the sw algorithm as a function of the spatial dimension @xmath17 and the number @xmath0 of potts spin states .",
    "the best information on the dynamic critical exponent @xmath18 prior to the present work is summarized in table  [ z_sw_table ] .",
