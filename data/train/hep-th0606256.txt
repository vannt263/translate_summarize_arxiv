    "suppose we are interested in the physics of events localized in a region @xmath1 of the space .",
    "the hilbert space of states can be decomposed accordingly as a tensor product @xmath2 of the spaces of the states localized in @xmath1 and in the complementary region @xmath3 .",
    "take now the vacuum @xmath4 as a global state of the system , with density matrix @xmath5 .",
    "the state @xmath6 relevant to the algebra of operators acting on @xmath7 follows from the partial trace of @xmath8 over the complementary hilbert space @xmath9 .",
    "this gives the local reduced density matrix @xmath10 the global state @xmath8 is generally entangled in the bipartite system @xmath11 and in consequence this matrix is mixed .",
    "the corresponding entropy @xmath12 is usually called entanglement or geometric entropy .",
    "the entanglement entropy is one of the most prominent candidates to explain the intriguing entropy of the black holes @xcite .",
    "however , in this proposal the role of quantum gravity is fundamental to produce a finite entropy , and the whole subject is still controversial . on the other hand , this and other measures of entanglement",
    "have also been extensively studied in condensed matter and low dimensional systems , partially motivated by advances in quantum information theory and the density matrix renormalization group method . as a result",
    "it was uncovered that a variety of phenomena such as quantum phase transitions have an interesting correlate in the entanglement properties of fundamental states @xcite . from the point of view of quantum field theory ( qft )",
    "the function @xmath13 can be considered as a non local variable with interesting non perturbative properties @xcite , which can be defined for any theory disregarding the field content . in this context",
    ", we can mention among the applications the description of topological order @xcite , and the renormalization group irreversibility in two dimensions @xcite .    in the continuum limit described by a quantum field theory the entanglement entropy is divergent due to the presence of an unbounded number of local degrees of freedom .",
    "the divergent terms must be proportional to quantities which are local and extensive on the boundary of @xmath1 .",
    "this can be seen as a consequence of the local nature of the ultraviolet divergences , and that the boundary is shared between @xmath1 and @xmath3 which have the same entropy ( for any pure global state ) @xmath14 on a technical level this characteristic of the divergent terms is due the fact that the entanglement entropy is the variation of the euclidean free energy with respect to conical singularities located on the boundary of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "thus , in @xmath15 spatial dimensions , we expect to have an expansion of the form @xmath16 \\,\\epsilon^{-(d-1 ) } + g_{d-2}[\\partial v]\\,\\epsilon^{-(d-2 ) } + ... + g_0[\\partial v]\\,\\log ( \\epsilon \\lambda)+ s_0(v)\\ , ,    \\label{div}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is a finite part , @xmath18 is a short distance cutoff , and the @xmath19 are local and extensive functions on the boundary @xmath20 , which are homogeneous of degree @xmath21 ( in a different context a similar expansion was used in @xcite ) .",
    "the leading divergent term coefficient @xmath22 $ ] is proportional to the @xmath23 power of the size of @xmath1 .",
    "this was noted since the earliest papers on the subject @xcite and is usually referred to as the area law for the entanglement entropy .",
    "however , strictly speaking , @xmath24 depend on the regularization procedure and it is not proportional to the area if this later is not rotational invariant .",
    "for example , if we draw a square of side @xmath25 on a two dimensional lattice , we would have @xmath26 , where @xmath18 is the lattice spacing , but where the dimensionless constant @xmath27 strongly depends on the relative angle between the square sides and the lattice symmetry axes . moreover , all the terms @xmath19 with @xmath28 are not physical within qft since they are not related to continuum quantities .    on the contrary , the dimensionless coefficient @xmath29 of the logarithmic term is expected to be universal .",
    "logarithmic divergent terms in the entropy have been previously found in four dimensional black hole space - times @xcite .",
    "they are present generically in even dimensions for sets with smooth curved boundaries .",
    "this follows from the heat kernel expansion for conical manifolds with smooth singularity surface @xcite .    in this work",
    "we show that there is also a logarithmic term in three dimensions for sets @xmath1 with non - smooth boundary .",
    "in particular , we consider the case of spatial polygonal sets ( in a different scenario , a logarithmic contribution to the entanglement entropy was also reported in @xcite ) . since @xmath29 is dimensionless , extensive and local on the boundary",
    "we conclude that for @xmath1 a polygon it must be of the form @xmath30 where the sum is over all vertices @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the vertex angle . on general grounds",
    "one also expects point - like vertex induced logarithmic terms in any dimensions .",
    "all these considerations apply to the alpha - entropies ( or rnyi entropies ) as well @xmath33 these measures of information behave very much like the entanglement entropy , as discussed in several papers @xcite . for integer",
    "@xmath34 they are also more suitable for explicit calculation , since the traces @xmath35 involved can be represented by a functional integral on an n - sheeted space with conical singularities located at the boundary of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the entanglement entropy follows from @xmath36 by analytical continuation .",
    "thus , in 2 + 1 dimensional theories the alpha - entropies contain a logarithmic term @xmath37 analogous to the one in ( [ div ] ) for the entropy .",

    ", we find the small angle limit of @xmath45 for free fields and relate it to the two dimensional entropic c - functions .",
    "finally , in section 4 we present our conclusions .",
    "we have also included in the appendix a a detailed derivation of the formulas concerning the green function in the sphere with a cut presented in section 2.1 , and in appendix b , the method we have used to compute numerically the geometric entropy in a two dimensional lattice .",

    "now , we may approximately decompose a plane angular sector with small angle @xmath46 as a union of thin and long rectangles with bigger size as we move further from the angle vertex .",
    "thus , there is a term in the entropy for the angular sector which is due to the sum of the terms ( [ tete ] ) for the rectangles ( the term ( [ tete ] ) is extensive in the direction in which lie the different rectangles ) . in the limit of an infinite partition",
    "this gives the desired result @xmath164    [ tb ]",
    "we have shown that there is a logarithmic divergent term with universal coefficient for the entanglement entropy corresponding to spatial polygonal sets in 2 + 1 dimensions .",
    "we have found the analytic expression for the coefficient in the alpha entropies for integer @xmath34 and a free scalar field , and the small angle limit for the corresponding coefficient on the geometric entropy for general free fields .",
    "interestingly , since this paper first appeared as a preprint , a vertex induced logarithmically divergent term in three dimensions has also been found in the conjectured geometrical form of the entanglement entropy for some conformal field theories arising in the ads / cft duality context @xcite .",

    "( [ tete ] ) and ( [ 38 ] ) ) for their entropy functions , which presumably correspond to some interacting theory",
    ".    technically , the calculation in this paper amounts to the one of the conformal anomaly for a free scalar on a three - dimensional manifold with a conical singularity located on the boundary of a plane angular sector .",
    "this is a non - trivial result , since there is no known general method applicable to this case involving conical singularity surfaces which are themselves non - smooth .",
    "we have shown that this particular problem can be mapped to the one of the calculation of the trace of the green function for a massive scalar field on a two dimensional sphere where boundary conditions are imposed on a segment of a great circle .",

    "this space is equivalent to the surface @xmath166 in @xmath44 minkowski space .",
    "the euclidean de sitter space then corresponds to a sphere with radius @xmath40 .",
    "the formulas corresponding to ( [ sumz ] ) and ( [ green ] ) in this case take us again to the green function on the cut sphere .",
    "the result can then be readily written off , @xmath167 where @xmath150 is the physical size of the geodesic interval , and @xmath82 is the field mass .",
    "the additive constant is logarithmically divergent with the cutoff , in order to keep @xmath36 positive for small values of @xmath150 .",
    "the formulas ( [ 35 ] ) , ( [ tete ] ) and ( [ 38 ] ) show a remarkable relation between universal terms in the entropies for different dimensions .",
    "the function @xmath168 , with @xmath149 the one dimensional entropy corresponding to an interval of length @xmath150 , plays the role of the zamolodchikov s c - function in the entanglement entropy c - theorem @xcite .",
    "this theorem states that there is a universal dimensionless quantity in two dimensions which is decreasing under scaling and has a well defined value at the fixed points ( proportional to the virasoro central charge)@xcite .",
    "the c - function introduced by zamolodchikov is constructed from a correlator of stress tensor traces , and we have shown that it can be taken to be @xmath169 as well .",
    "there has been a substantial effort to extend the c - theorem to higher dimensions , but a definitive result in this direction is still missing @xcite . at fixed points the function @xmath169 is a constant given by the coefficient of the term proportional to @xmath170 in the two dimensional entropy .",
    "then , one would be tempted to speculate that a running function which takes the value @xmath45 at fixed points could be a good candidate for a c - function in three dimensions .",
    "on the other hand , the logarithmic term in the entropy induced by the vertices is , remarkably , the only obstacle in the following simple argument attempting to prove the c - theorem in any dimensions . consider the mutual information @xmath171 between two non intersecting sets @xmath172 and @xmath173 .",
    "this is dimensionless and universal ( all boundary terms get subtracted ) , and it is also positive and increasing with the size of each set separately @xcite .",
