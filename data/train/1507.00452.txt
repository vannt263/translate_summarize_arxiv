    "it is not too far - fetched then to suspect that there exists a cluster structure on @xmath3 compatible with the poisson - lie bracket induced by the poisson - lie bracket on @xmath2 .",
    "however , an interesting phenomenon was observed even in the first nontrivial example of @xmath4 : although we were able to construct a log - canonical regular coordinate chart in terms of which all standard coordinate functions are expressed as ( subtraction free ) laurent polynomials , it is not possible to define cluster transformations in such a way that all cluster variables that one expects to be mutable transform into regular functions .",
    "this problem is resolved , however , if one is allowed to use _ generalized cluster transformations _ previously considered in @xcite and , more recently , axiomatized in @xcite .",
