    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) predicts a transition in sufficiently hot and/or dense nuclear matter from colorless hadrons to a state of deconfined quarks and gluons known as the _ quark - gluon plasma _ ( qgp ) @xcite .",
    "it is believed that this transition has been observed in experiments performed at the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "fast partons ( partons with velocity approaching the speed of light ) created by hard transverse scattering in the early moments of a heavy - ion collision are a useful probe in understanding qgp physics .",
    "of particular importance is the process of _ jet quenching _ in which fast partons lose energy and momentum by interacting with the surrounding medium ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .    while much effort has been devoted to understanding the dynamics of jet quenching , the question of how the energy and momentum deposited by the fast parton affects the bulk behavior of an evolving qgp is relatively new ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "one promising approach is to treat the fast parton as the source of energy and momentum coupled to the hydrodynamic equations of the medium .",
    "there is strong evidence @xcite that the matter created in heavy - ion collisions at rhic can be described by nearly ideal hydrodynamics and it was argued in @xcite that if the energy and momentum deposited by a fast parton thermalize quickly the resulting disturbance should evolve hydrodynamically as well .",
    "casalderrey - solana _",
    "_ @xcite suggested that since the fast parton travels through the medium at supersonic speed , one might expect a mach cone to develop in the surrounding hydrodynamic medium .",
    "they proceeded to show that if one uses an appropriately chosen supersonic sound source in a linearized hydrodynamic evolution one indeed observes a propagating mach cone .",
    "in their work , the explicit calculation of the source term generated by a supersonic parton was not addressed . in a later work",
    "@xcite chaudhuri and heinz examined a two - dimensional hydrodynamics simulation of an expanding qgp with a phenomenologically motivated ansatz as their fast parton source term . here",
    "the authors failed to find the formation of a mach cone except for seemingly unphysical values of energy loss .",
    "much recent work @xcite has been focused on examining a supersonic color charge passing through an @xmath0 supersymmetric yang - mills plasma ( in both of the above citations the authors find a mach cone in the resulting dynamics ) .",
    "such efforts are motivated by the idea that the system is a useful model of a real qcd plasma .",
    "as the above examples illustrate , there have been several insightful attempts at understanding the influence of fast partons on the bulk evolution of an expanding qgp . however , the explicit evaluation of the distribution of energy and momentum deposited by a supersonic parton traversing a qcd plasma has remained an open question . it has been pointed out @xcite that the medium s response to a fast parton is sensitive to the specific form of energy and momentum deposition . for example",
    ", the hydrodynamic source vector of a parton moving at constant velocity , @xmath1 , can be written in fourier space as @xcite @xmath22 \\pi \\delta(\\omega - { { \\bf",
    "u}}\\cdot { { \\bf q}}).\\ ] ]",
    "the medium s response then becomes sensitive to the functions @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "for instance , if one sets @xmath5 then the source fails to excite diffusive momentum density in the medium .",
    "the full momentum dependence of the source is necessary to predict the spectrum and shape of the sound wave excited in the medium .",
    "the sensitivity of the medium s response to the specific mechanism of energy and momentum deposition creates the need for a hydrodynamic source term derived from first principles .    in order to derive such a source term one must first understand the mechanism of energy and momentum deposition and the different scales involved .",
    "consider a weakly coupled qcd plasma at an asymptotically high temperature @xmath6 . in this system",
    "a fast parton interacts with the medium and creates a disturbance at a distance scale of the order @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the running coupling .",
    "the disturbance in turn interacts with the surrounding medium , creating a new disturbance which again interacts with the medium , and the process continues , each time at larger and larger distance scales .",
    "one could , in principle , determine the medium s response to a fast parton at arbitrarily large distances by calculating each subsequent disturbance up to the desired scale .",
    "in practice , however , it is desirable to use an effective theory , which becomes valid at some length scale , to model the medium s response at long distances .",
    "as mentioned previously , it is believed that nearly ideal hydrodynamics is an accurate model of the long distance behavior of the qgp produced at rhic .",
    "hydrodynamics becomes valid at length scales which are large compared to the mean free path .",
    "again , considering a weakly coupled qcd plasma at high temperature , @xmath6 , the transport mean free path is of order @xmath9 @xcite . thus to derive an effective qcd hydrodynamic source term",
    "one should calculate the medium s response up to distances ( at least ) of order @xmath9 , at which point the system evolves hydrodynamically .",
    "recently , neufeld _ et al . _",
    "@xcite gave a schematic derivation of the hydrodynamic source term expected from a fast parton moving through a qgp in the relativistic limit ( velocity approaching the speed of light ) in the absence of in - medium screening by including the medium response at a distance scale of the order @xmath7 .",
    "the authors found a propagating mach cone in the resulting linearized hydrodynamic evolution . in this work , i will explicitly derive this distribution in the context of kinetic theory including color screening .",
    "the approach will be to treat the fast parton as the source of an external color field interacting with a perturbative qgp through the collisionless boltzmann equation .",
    "after obtaining the microscopic equation of motion , i find the macroscopic evolution by taking moments via the usual chapman - enskog approach and making the assumption of local thermal equilibrium .",
    "i find that the fast parton serves as a source distribution of energy and momentum for the hydrodynamic equations of the medium .",
    "i then perform an explicit evaluation of the distribution both with and without including the medium s response to screen the fast parton s color field and interpret the results .    as mentioned above",
    ", a consistent derivation of the hydrodynamic source term should include medium response to distances ( at least ) of order @xmath9 . in that sense",

    "assuming @xmath28 can be treated as a perturbation in an otherwise equilibrated system the contribution from @xmath27 should be small and higher moments , such as @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) , which are of higher order in @xmath28 , will be ignored .",
