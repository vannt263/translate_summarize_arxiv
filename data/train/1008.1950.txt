    "i suggest that due to the higher mass of pv cep compared to t tauri stars , the grains in the pv cep disk atmosphere will take a longer timescale to grow and settle downward toward the disk midplane . at that time , they will presumably continue their evolution like the more evolved herbig ae stars , such as v892 tau .",
    "the pv cep star is the youngest and the least evolved resolved disk known around any herbig ae star .",
    "its dust evolutionary stage is different than the youngest t tauri and class 0 stars.    this raises the question of whether the evolutionary process of herbig ae stars is different than t tauri stars. in this study , pv cep case indicates that it is different , or slower , in the beginning , at the age of a few @xmath4 10@xmath5 yrs .",
    "although , a study of more disks around more herbig stars of different ages is important to further probe the evolution of herbig ae compared to t tauri stars ( * ? ? ? * in preparation . ) .",
    "higher spatial - resolution interferometric observations are necessary for such a study",
    ". the new generation of interferometers alma and evla will provide sensitive high - spatial resolution images .",
    "this will allow us to extend the sample of resolved herbig aebe disks into the fainter and farther objects , such as the massive herbig be stars .",
