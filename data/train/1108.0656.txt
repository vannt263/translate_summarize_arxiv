    "the discovery of a puzzling new population of compact @xmath4 massive elliptical galaxies existing at epoch when the universe was not more than one - third of its current age has posed profound challenges for both monolithic and hierarchical model of galaxy formation and evolution .",

    "visible and near - infared ( nir ) spectroscopy of individual high-@xmath6 ` red and dead ' galaxies have revealed high velocity dispersions and central stellar densities @xcite which are consistent with those expected from compact galaxies .    in the present paper",

    "our main aim is to use these galaxies to determine whether galactic size growth is a continuous process that occurs over this full redshift range , or a process that is mainly associated with a particular epoch .",
    "our result will place additional constraints on two mechanisms that have been proposed to explain the observed size growth : ( 1 ) minor dry mergers or late accretion ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and ( 2 ) adiabatic expansion due to extreme mass loss ( caused by stellar winds or quasar activity , * ? ? ?",

    "the cl1252/cdfs survey presented in @xcite provided srsic profiles of quiescent galaxies along with their half - light radii , but without corresponding srsic indices . in eight out of 11 remaining surveys , for which the shape of galaxy s surface brightness profiles can be classified as disk - like or spheroid - like based on the srsic index , the majority of quiescent galaxies and compact objects are spheroids with @xmath18 .",
    "the three spectroscopic surveys in our compilation with more than 50% of disk - dominated compact objects are the musyc survey @xcite , the survey presented in @xcite , and the gmass @xcite . while the musyc focuses on galaxies at @xmath19 , 67% ( 4/6 ) of disk - like objects with compact morphologies from @xcite and @xcite",

    "we note that @xcite claim that the majority of massive compact galaxies at @xmath21 are disk - dominated .",
    "in compiling the data summarized in table  [ tab1 ] we augmented our published nicmos sizes for quiescent galaxies in the gdds fields @xcite with additional measurments obtained from imaging with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) .",
    "the observational strategy for this acs imaging was laid out in @xcite , and the mages were processed using the technques described in @xcite . out of the 40 quiescent gdds galaxies imaged with acs , four objects were also imaged with hst nicmos camera 3 in @xmath22  band in @xcite .",
    "sizes obtained with acs agreed to within @xmath23 with those obtained from nicmos . in cases with duplicate measurments we chose to retain the nicmos sizes because they probe longer rest frame wavelengths , which are less affected by dust extinction and are better tracers of total stellar emission",
    ". residual images for another three galaxies show asymmetric features and their 2d profiles can not be reliably modelled with one - component or two - component srsic profiles .",
    "finally , two objects appear in the acs images as mergers ( one merging pair is spectroscopically confirmed ) and modelling of their 2d profiles depends critically on details of how the companion galaxy is masked , so we omitted these galaxies from our sample . after making these cuts ,",
    "an additional 31 gdds quiescent massive galaxies were added to our total sample .",
    "the complete list of objects in our compilation with all their properties we used to construct relations presented in this paper is given in table  [ tab2 ] .",

    "this is in good agreement with the findings of @xcite , who reported that the slope of the relation between size @xmath10 and stellar mass @xmath34 of massive quiescent galaxies stays constant , while its zero point smoothly evolves towards lower half - light radii with increasing redshift .",

    "our sample contains 38 objects ( less than 10% ) in that redshift range and for the high-@xmath6 surveys in the sample with known spectroscopic completeness level it varies from @xmath38  ( gmass ) to @xmath39 ( gdds , gs / acs ) .",

    "the major portion of the @xmath43 objects @xmath44 presented in this paper lies in the redshift range @xmath45 . on the other hand the local data outnumbers the high - redshift data by orders of magnitude and a straightforward unweighted fit to all the data points clearly places unfair emphasis on fitting the @xmath46 galaxies .",
    "furthermore , the size measurements of the brightest and most massive galaxies in the sdss sample are affected by the uncertainties in the estimated background sky level producing a steeper slope of the size - mass relation observed locally @xcite . therefore , as a first ( fairly robust ) step toward understanding the trends with redshift , we have instead chosen to calculate the best fit obtained by fitting the median values in the six redshift bins , i.e. giving each redshift range equal weight .",
    "this results in @xmath47 ( with the range of 1  @xmath48 errors obtained by using the bootstrap resampling method ) .",
    "this fit is shown in red in figure  [ f3 ] , with the corresponding uncertainty shown as a gray band .",

    "this apparent discrepancy might be the result of earlier studies being based on samples spanning a limited redshift range , or which combine spectroscopic and photometric redshift samples , or which group passively evolving and star - forming objects together , or which contain small number of objects ( four things we have tried to avoid doing in the present paper ) .",
    "on the other hand , perhaps it will eventually prove interesting to group _ some _ star - forming objects with quiescent galaxies at a range of redshifts , since the form of _ continuous  size evolution we obtain for our spectroscopic sample of massive quiescent galaxies is in good agreement with the somewhat shallower size - redshift relation found for uv - bright and submillimetre galaxies in goods - north field with secure spectroscopic redshifts over the @xmath54  range ( @xmath55 , * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "recently , @xcite have performed structural analysis of @xmath56 star - forming and passively evolving galaxies in the redshift range @xmath57 from the ukidss ultra - deep survey .",
    "in addition to the uncertainties introduced by photometric redshifts , the individual size measurements are largely affected by the use of ground based imaging in this survey .",
    "nevertheless , their simulations and empirical tests show that the data provides robust estimates of the _ average  sizes of a large galaxy sample down to @xmath58  kpc radii .",
