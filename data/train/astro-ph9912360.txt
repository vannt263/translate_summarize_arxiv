    "the star @xmath0 scorpii ( hd 149438 ) is the mk standard for the b0 v spectral type , although walborn ( 1995 , private communication ) has classified it as b0.2 v on the basis of its stellar wind lines .",
    "the star has served as a benchmark in studies of radiatively driven winds of hot stars .",
    "this is because it lies in a pivotal region of the hr diagram where stellar winds are making a transition from the massive and fast winds of the o stars to the winds of b stars that can just marginally be driven by line forces .    in the lamers & rogerson ( 1978 ) study of _ copernicus",
    "_ satellite spectra of early - type stars , @xmath0  sco  was the latest spectral type to show the superionization stage of o@xmath1vi .",
    "stars with spectral types close to that of @xmath0  sco  are also the latest to show the x - ray to bolometric luminosity relation @xmath12 that holds throughout the main sequence o spectral region . for stars of spectral type b1.5 v and later , this ratio of luminosities decreases by more than an order of magnitude , ( cassinelli et  al .",
    "it is generally thought that the x - rays from hot stars arise from shocks embedded in the stellar winds ( owocki , castor , & rybicki 1988 , hereafter ocr ; cooper 1994 ) , so the decrease in the x - ray luminosity may be an additional consequence of the slower and less massive winds of near main sequence b stars .",
    "massa , savage , & cassinelli ( 1984 ) found from a study of the uv lines that the wind properties of stars of spectral types b0 v to b2 v are particularly sensitive to the stellar composition , with winds ranging from non - detectable to quite strong for stars with increasing metal abundances .",
    "the stars near this spectral range are also commonly seen as emission line be stars , for which the stellar rotation may produce wind compressed equatorial disks as suggested by bjorkman & cassinelli ( 1993 ) and owocki , cranmer , & blondin ( 1994 ) or rotationally induced bistability as suggested by lamers & pauldrach ( 1991 ) and lamers et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .",
    "while @xmath0  sco  is a standard star , its stellar wind is anything but typical .",
    "the two most unusual properties of its wind , and those that we will focus on , are the peculiar red - shifted absorption seen in wind lines of high ionization species such as o@xmath1vi , which are not present in the photosphere of this star , and its excessively - hard x - ray spectrum .",
    "the first of the peculiar wind properties of @xmath0  sco  was discovered by lamers & rogerson ( 1978 ) in their analysis of _ copernicus _ observations .",
    "they noted that the absorption produced by o@xmath1vi  and n@xmath1v  extended _ redward _ of line center by as much as + 250 km  s@xmath3 . for stars with massive winds",
    ", the strong uv resonance lines have p cygni - type profiles , which are noted for the absorption shortward of line center owing to scattering in the expanding wind .",
    "the absorption longward of the line center in @xmath0  sco  is unusual .",
    "absorption redward of line center could occur if the observed resonance line is also present in the photosphere of the star",
    ". however , the superionization stages of o@xmath1vi , n@xmath1v , and should not be present in the photosphere of @xmath0  sco , which has an effective temperature of @xmath13 k. two ways to explain the redshifted component are mentioned by lamers and rogerson ( 1978 ) : turbulence in the flow near the base of the wind , and infall of highly - ionized material .",
    "both phenomena could produce a positive velocity component in these ionic lines .",
    "the second peculiarity of @xmath0  sco  is its very hard x - ray spectrum and large x - ray luminosity .",
    "in their _ rosat _  survey of near - main sequence b stars , cassinelli et  al .",
    "( 1994 ) found that @xmath0  sco  has a high x - ray to bolometric luminosity ratio : @xmath14 ; this is an order of magnitude larger than most o and early b stars .",
    "furthermore , they found that the x - ray spectrum has an anomalously luminous hard component above 1 kev .",
    "the hard x - rays from this wind are unusual in that they require plasma temperatures in excess of @xmath4 k. cohen , cassinelli , & waldron ( 1997 ; hereafter ccw ) have more recently presented observations of @xmath0  sco  obtained with the _ asca _  satellite .",
    "these observations confirm the earlier _ rosat_results requiring a very high temperature component to explain the observed x - ray spectrum .",
    "the _ asca _",
    "observations were fit with a multi - temperature equilibrium plasma model characterized by temperatures of @xmath15 k with emission measures of @xmath16 @xmath17 , respectively .    the very high temperature gas inferred from the x - ray spectrum of @xmath0  sco  is not explained in the standard picture of x - ray production in early type stars ( see discussion in ccw ) .",
    "numerical simulations of radiative shocks formed in the unstable stellar winds of ob stars suggest that these shocks are unable to produce temperatures much greater than a few times 10@xmath18 k ( ocr ; cooper 1994 ) .",
    "the shock - jump velocities in these simulations are limited to roughly half the local stellar wind velocity .",
    "the presence of very hot gas in the wind of @xmath0  sco  suggests that a different mechanism is responsible for at least some of the x - ray emission from this star .",
    "though several groups have attempted to model the radiatively - driven outflow from @xmath0  sco , they were unable to reproduce the observed hardness of the x - ray spectrum ( e.g. , cooper 1994 ; macfarlane & cassinelli 1989 ; lucy & white 1980 ) .    in this paper",
    "we explore a phenomenological model to explain both the hard x - ray emission and the redshifted absorption of high ionization lines .",
    "our model supposes density enhancements , or clumps , form in the smooth stellar wind and subsequently fall back towards the stellar surface , creating bow shocks at their leading edges .",
    "we investigate the trajectories of such clumps in a stellar wind and find infall to be achievable assuming the optical depths of these dense parcels of material are large enough to choke off the radiative line driving force . using our calculated trajectories , we estimate the temperature of the shocked gas swept up by the clumps and comment on the ability of this model to provide the high - temperature gas implied by the observed x - ray emission ( ccw ; cassinelli et  al .",
    "while the numerical details presented here apply to the specific case of @xmath0  sco , the model developed in this paper is applicable to most clumped , radiatively - driven outflows .",
    "the details and assumptions of our model are discussed in  [",
    "sec : model ] . in ",
    "[ sec : infall ] we derive the equation of motion for solitary clumps created within the wind and present the results of numerical integrations of clump trajectories .",
    "we describe the temperature spectrum of shocked plasmas in our model and discuss the observed x - ray emission in the context of this model in  [ sec : xrays ] . in  [ sec : conclusions ] we briefly discuss why @xmath0  sco  may be unusual among early - type stars , and we summarize our work in  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "table [ table : stardata ] lists the stellar parameters adopted throughout this work for @xmath0  sco .",
    "empirical determinations of the mass loss rate of @xmath0  sco  from uv lines gives discrepant results of @xmath19 ( lamers & rogerson 1978 ) , @xmath20 ( gathier et al .",
    "1981 ) and @xmath21 m@xmath10 yr@xmath3  ( hamann 1981 ) .",
    "these differences are due to differences in the adopted ionization fractions of the observed uv resonance lines of , , , n@xmath1v , o@xmath1vi , , and .",
    "the terminal velocity of the wind of @xmath0  sco  can not be derived from the observations , because the uv resonance lines are unsaturated .",
    "lamers and rogerson ( 1978 ) derived a lower limit of 2000 km  s@xmath3 . because of these uncertainties we adopt the values predicted by the modified line driven wind theory ( kudritzki et  al .",
    "1989 ) with the force multiplier parameters taken from abbott ( 1982 ) : @xmath22=0.156 , @xmath23=0.609 and @xmath24=0.12 .",
    "this gives a mass loss rate of @xmath25 m@xmath10 yr@xmath3  and @xmath26 = 2400 km  s@xmath3 , in agreement with the range of empirically derived parameters .",
    "the winds of early type stars are driven by resonance line scattering of radiation in the stellar envelope .",
    "this radiative driving mechanism is inherently unstable ( lucy and solomon 1970 ; lucy 1982 ; ocr ) .",
    "small perturbations on an otherwise monotonic wind velocity structure tend to grow and steepen into shocks .",
    "these instabilities have been well studied using one - dimensional hydrodynamical models ( see , e.g. , cooper 1994 , feldmeier 1995 ) , which show that the resulting wind is a mixture of rarified hot material and colder , dense regions .",
    "these studies also suggest the shock velocity jumps have maximal amplitudes of order one half the local wind velocity .",
    "the relationship between the velocity amplitude of a shock , @xmath27 , and the temperature behind the shock , @xmath28 , is given by @xmath29 in the case of most main sequence o stars and ob supergiants , the shock jump velocities are indeed strong enough to produce gas at the temperatures suggested by the observed x - ray emission ( @xmath30 k ; chlebowski , harnden , & sciortino 1989 ; cassinelli et  al .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of @xmath0  sco , however , implies gas with temperatures in excess of 10@xmath31 k ( ccw ) .",
    "numerical models of b star winds can not produce shocks with such high temperatures .",
    "velocity jumps of @xmath32 km  s@xmath3  are typical in numerical simulations ( cooper 1994 ) , while velocity jumps of more than 700 to 800 km  s@xmath3  are required to reproduce the hard x - ray emission from @xmath0  sco .",
    "while the one - dimensional shock production problem has been well studied , little attention has yet been given to the production of shocks and the structure of the wind in two or three dimensions .",
    "we assume that shocks and density enhancements in the stellar wind are relatively localized phenomena whose sizes are dictated by the local sound speed and instabilities that may tend to break up large sheets , such as the rayleigh - taylor instability .",
    "an individual shock is assumed to cover a small solid angle when viewed from the star .",
    "the one - dimensional simulations assume spherical symmetry ; our assumption is that the spherical shocks in these simulations would fragment relatively easily .",
    "cassinelli and swank ( 1983 ) have suggested such a scenario to explain the lack of variability observed in their einstein solid state spectrometer observations of ob supergiants",
    ". a stellar wind containing an ensemble of @xmath33 shocks that continuously form and dissipate can produce a non - detectable variability of order @xmath34 .",
    "the time variability of single spherical shocks in the wind of @xmath0  sco  is discussed by macfarlane & cassinelli ( 1989 ) .",
    "a schematic of our model is shown in figure [ fig : cartoon ] .",
    "the basic picture of the stellar wind that we adopt is one in which discrete density enhancements , or clumps , are embedded in an otherwise smooth stellar wind .",
    "these dense clumps of material have shock interfaces with the faster moving ambient wind .",
    "the most extreme of these clumps are dense enough to be optically thick to radiation in the strongest resonance lines , though still optically thin to uv continuum radiation .",
    "in addition to their treatment of stellar winds with organized velocity gradients , the theory of radiative acceleration on material with no internal velocity gradient was developed by castor , abbott , & klein ( 1975 , hereafter cak ) , and we use their parameterization of the line - driving force . the equations governing this acceleration are given in ",
    "[ sec : infall ] . assuming a cak parameterization of the line driving force",
    ", the net radiative acceleration on optically thick parcels of material with no internal velocity gradient can be relatively small ( see  [ sec : infall ] ) .",
    "gravity dominates the motion of these optically thick clumps , which fall inward , creating bow - shocks at their leading edges as they plow supersonically through the outflowing wind .",
    "the velocity structure of the ambient wind is assumed to be relatively unaffected by such clumps .",
    "they do not shadow a significant amount of the overlying wind , since they are optically thin to continuum radiation and the line opacity is significantly redshifted relative to the opacity driving the unperturbed wind .",
    "as the clumps fall inward , they shock the out - flowing gas of the ambient ( inter - clump ) wind .",
    "the temperature of gas the immediate post - shock region is proportional to the square of the shock jump velocity as in equation ( [ eqn : tshock ] ) .",
    "since the relevant velocity for the calculation of the shock temperatures in these bow shocks is the _ relative _ velocity between the clumps and the ambient wind , the temperatures needed to produce the hard x - ray component observed by _ rosat _  and _ asca _  are readily obtained .",
    "the x - ray producing shocks adjacent to the leading edge of the infalling clumps produce very highly - ionized material , thus accounting for the red - shifted high ions seen in absorption ( o@xmath1vi , n@xmath1v , etc . ) .",
    "a related model was considered by lucy & white ( 1980 , hereafter lw ) , in the first paper attempting to explain the source of hot star x - rays as shock - heated gas .",
    "they suggested that clumps are radiatively driven outward while the rest of the wind is pushed along by the drag of these objects . in our model",
    "the clumps move outward ( or inward ) with a velocity less than that of the ambient wind , so the shocks occur on the inner face of the clump .",
    "this placement of the shocks is more consistent with the results of ocr , who find that shocks tend to be inward facing with low - density , high - speed wind material being driven into slower and denser shocked regions . however , we retain the clump aspect of the lw model .",
    "let us assume the clumps are self - contained parcels of gas confined by the ram pressure of the wind through which they fall .",
    "following lw , we assume a balance of dynamical pressures and write the average density of a clump , @xmath35 , falling through the wind as @xmath36 in this expression @xmath37 is the wind density , a function of the distance @xmath38 from the star , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the thermal velocities in the wind and clump , respectively , and @xmath41 is the relative velocity between the wind and the clump . we have ignored the effects of turbulence within the clumps but have included the constant @xmath42 as a scale factor to account for the range of angles at which the wind hits the bow - shock ( see lw ) .",
    "we can see from this that once a clump begins to decelerate , thereby increasing @xmath41 , the oncoming wind confines it more effectively , making it denser as it falls towards the star .",
    "this further decreases the ability of the radiation field to drive the clump outwards .",
    "if the mass of material accumulated into a clump is specified , then the volume can be readily obtained from the density derived using equation ( [ eqn : dens ] ) .",
    "this model has the desirable attribute of producing both the red - shifted high - ion absorption and the anomolously hard x - rays .",
    "several independent lines of evidence suggest that clumping can be important in the winds of wolf - rayet ( e.g. , lpine , moffat , & henriksen 1996 ) and ob supergiant winds ( e.g. , sako et  al .",
    "1999 ; eversberg , lpine , & moffat 1998 ) .",
    "it is within reason that near main sequence early type stars may also contain localized regions of significantly higher than average densities .",
    "the exact mechanism for the formation of these dense clumps is not rigorously approached in this work , but it is worthwhile to explore the consequences of such a model before a more thorough hydrodynamical study is undertaken .",
    "the main driving force for winds from massive stars is the radiative acceleration associated with atomic absorption line opacity .",
    "the most important of the driving lines are the ultraviolet resonance lines of abundant ionic species .",
    "thus , the driving force is not only dependent upon the elemental abundances in a wind , but also upon the wind s ionization balance ( macfarlane , cohen , & wang 1994 ; abbott 1982 ) .",
    "the equation of motion describing the trajectory of a parcel of gas with respect to the star is @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the velocity of the clump of material , @xmath45 the mass of the star , @xmath38 the distance of a clump from its center , and @xmath46 is the force per unit mass the ambient wind exerts upon the clump in the form of a  drag . \"",
    "the terms @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the ratios of the radiative to gravitational acceleration for electron scattering and resonance line scattering , respectively .",
    "the drag force , @xmath46 , is zero if there is no relative motion between a clump and the ambient wind . in this treatment",
    "we have not allowed for a thermal pressure gradient in the wind , which is negligible in the supersonic portion of such an outflow .    for the ambient stellar wind , @xmath49 .",
    "the requirement for the material to be accelerated away from the star is @xmath50 , implying @xmath51 , i.e. , that the radiative acceleration is greater than the gravitational acceleration .",
    "a dense clump of material formed in the wind that has @xmath52 may decelerate and possibly fall back to the surface of the star , plowing its way through the out - flowing wind as it falls .",
    "however , even for clumps with @xmath53 , the drag force , @xmath46 , may be great enough to push the clump outwards in the stellar wind . to determine if infall is physically reasonable",
    ", we shall develop more fully each of the terms in equation ( [ eqn : motion1 ] ) .",
    "the radiative driving force on a parcel of wind material is considered to have two components : radiative driving via electron scattering and resonance line opacities .",
    "the radiative acceleration due to electron scattering of the stellar continuum is written @xmath54 here @xmath55 is the electron scattering opacity , which is @xmath56 @xmath57  g@xmath3 for @xmath0  sco , @xmath58 is the frequency - integrated stellar flux at the location of the material , and @xmath59 is the speed of light .    a proper treatment of the radiative driving of stellar winds owing to absorption line opacity has been given by cak ( see also abbott 1982 ) .",
    "their theory paramaterizes the line driving force on a wind having an organized velocity gradient @xmath60 . in cak theory , the radiative acceleration due to line scattering , @xmath61 ,",
    "is written @xmath62 where @xmath63 is for a reference electron scattering opacity of 0.325 @xmath57 g@xmath3 .",
    "so @xmath61 is simply the reference electron scattering acceleration modified by a multiplicative factor .",
    "this factor , @xmath64 , the so - called `` force multiplier , '' is a function of @xmath65 , an optical depth parameter that is independent of line strength .",
    "the force multiplier is defined as @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the electron density in units of @xmath68 @xmath17 , @xmath69 is the dilution factor and @xmath70 and @xmath24 are the cak parameters .",
    "these parameters have been determined from studies employing extensive atomic line lists and depend upon the temperature of the absorbing material ( see , e.g. , abbott 1982 ) .",
    "however , the driving force for the density enhancements we will consider here is slightly different from the typical cak driving force for the ambient wind .    in the cak treatment of expanding atmospheres or winds",
    ", @xmath65 is the electron scattering optical depth over the distance in which the wind velocity increases by the thermal velocity . hence @xmath65 is inversely proportional to the local velocity gradient for outflows with monotonically increasing velocity laws ( cak ) . in the case of parcels of gas with no organized velocity gradient , such as those being considered here",
    ", the optical depth parameter @xmath65 is the integral of the electron scattering opacity over the path length @xmath71 through the region or clump [ equation ( 5 ) of cak ] : @xmath72 approximating the integral as @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the volume of the clump , equation ( [ eqn : tdef2 ] ) may be rewritten , using equation ( [ eqn : dens ] ) , as @xmath75 assuming @xmath76 .",
    "this latter assumption has the desirable consequence that the density of a clump will approach that of the ambient wind as the relative velocity , @xmath41 , approaches zero .",
    "the ratio of the radiative to gravitational accelerations in cak formalism is written @xmath77       \\left [ 1 + { \\cal m}(t ) \\right ] , \\label{eqn : gamma}\\ ] ] given @xmath78 , the luminosity of the star .",
    "we will assume the values of the cak parameters tabulated by abbott ( 1982 ) for stellar winds at 30,000 k ( @xmath79 and @xmath80 ) are appropriate for use in the clumps considered here .",
    "these are the same as those used for estimating the mass loss rate . given the high densities predicted for the clumps and the presence of a hard x - ray source at their leading edges ,",
    "the ionization balance in the clumps could be different than that of the ambient wind .",
    "thus while the cak parameters appropriate for the clump may be different than those used here , we adopt these parameters in order to proceed . in the end , the choice of cak parameters will likely not matter too much so long as the optical depth through a clump is very high .",
    "equation ( [ eqn : gamma ] ) gives an upper limit to the radiative acceleration because it assumes that the flux from the star reaching a parcel of gas is unattenuated by the layers closer to the star . for a clump moving outwards at lower velocities than the ambient wind",
    ", the photons producing the line radiation pressure on the dense clump may already have been absorbed or scattered by gas lower in the wind with the same outward velocity as the clump .",
    "we will ignore this effect here , which is expected to be small .",
    "the standard drag force per unit mass on a clump of area @xmath81 moving through an ambient medium with a relative velocity @xmath41 is given by @xmath82 in this treatment @xmath83 is the mass of the clump , and @xmath84 is the density of the ambient medium ( in this case the ambient stellar wind ) .",
    "the drag coefficient , @xmath85 , dictates the efficiency of momentum transfer to the clump , and the factor of @xmath86 is conventionally included .",
    "this expression describes the energy density impinging on the clump integrated over the area of the clump . for most of this work",
    "we will assume @xmath87 , i.e. , perfect transfer of momentum from the ambient wind to the clump .",
    "this is the most stringent assumption for determining if infall is viable .",
    "the cross section of the clump may be approximated @xmath88 , giving @xmath89 using equation ( [ eqn : dens ] ) , and assuming @xmath90 and @xmath91 , we rewrite this as @xmath92 the density of the wind at a distance @xmath38 from the surface of the star is calculated assuming mass conservation : @xmath93 where m  is the mass loss rate ( see table [ table : stardata ] ) .",
    "the velocity of the wind @xmath94 is calculated using a @xmath95 velocity law with @xmath96 ( groenewegen & lamers 1989 ) : @xmath97 with the values of @xmath26 and @xmath98 given in table [ table : stardata ] .",
    "the magnitude of the drag force can be relatively small .",
    "we estimate its magnitude using equations ( [ eqn : drag ] ) and ( [ eqn : continuity ] ) with the data given in table [ table : stardata ] : @xmath99 where we have assumed @xmath100 , which in this equation is in units km  s@xmath3 . if we define @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is the force of gravity per unit mass , we can rewrite equation ( [ eqn : motion1 ] ) as @xmath103 .",
    "we find @xmath104 where @xmath105 is again in km  s@xmath3 .",
    "we can see that very near the star , the drag force is relatively small compared with the force of gravity because the velocity between the clump and the ambient wind is smaller than at larger radii .",
    "this prediction is based on the assumption @xmath106 , but for clumps producing temperatures in excess of @xmath4 k , our numerical calculations discussed in  [ subsec : traject ] suggest the drag force is much more significant ( relative to gravity ) at larger radii . for clumps with masses @xmath107 ( in grams )",
    "the outward drag force is comparable to the force of gravity at large distances ( @xmath108 ) from the stellar surface . for lower mass clumps",
    ", however , the drag force can play an important role in the dynamics at intermediate distances from the star ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "we have derived the individual components of equation ( [ eqn : motion1 ] ) , and can hence obtain trajectories in position - velocity space for clumps in the wind of @xmath0  sco .",
    "equation ( [ eqn : motion1 ] ) shows the dynamics of such clumps depend on the relative velocity , @xmath41 , between the clump and the ambient wind : @xmath110 , where @xmath94 and @xmath44 are the wind and clump velocities , respectively .",
    "we have numerically integrated the equation of motion for parcels of gas with various initial conditions since it does not have a analytically tractable solution .",

    "the dependence on @xmath83 comes in through equations ( [ eqn : t2 ] ) and ( [ eqn : drag ] ) , the former affecting @xmath64  in the radiative acceleration .",
    "our numerical integrations of the equation of motion show two types of clump trajectories : outflow and infall trajectories .",
    "we term those trajectories in which the clumps are driven from the star , though they may initially decelerate , _ outflow _",
    "though these clumps are driven outward , they always have velocities less than the terminal velocity of the wind .",

    "for instance we have neglected the cooling of the gas in the bow shocks around the clumps .",
    "the gas that is heated to @xmath159 will eventually cool through the lower x - ray emitting temperatures , providing for enhanced emission in the soft x - ray bands over that shown in figures [ fig : tempdist1 ] and [ fig : tempdist2 ] . though the temperature distributions peak at the same temperatures , the temperature distribution for the infall trajectory ( figure [ fig : tempdist1 ] ) is narrower than that of the outflow trajectory ( figure [ fig : tempdist2 ] ) , which shows a strong tail towards higher temperatures .",
    "the ratio of the emission measures of x - ray emitting gas observed by ccw at ( 1.2 and @xmath160 k is @xmath161 .",
    "both the outflow and infall trajectories have similar displayed in these figures produce x - ray emitting material at ( 1.2 and @xmath162 k in a ratio of 1.9:1 .",
    "this value is consistent with the observational constraints , though the effects of radiative and adiabatic cooling will affect the final distribution of x - ray emission .    in all likelihood a population of clumps in the wind of @xmath0  sco  will have a range of initial conditions , providing a range of x - ray producing temperatures and x - ray luminosities per clump .",
    "the distribution of intial conditions , the true shape of the bow shock at the leading edges of the infalling clumps , and the cooling of the post - shock gas will all determine the true temperature and luminosity distribution of x - ray emitting gas .",
    "the derivation of these factors is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "our goal is to show that the production of very hot gas , in excess of @xmath4 k , is possible in the wind of @xmath0  sco  through the infall of dense material .",
    "our dynamical modelling of the dense clumps in  [ sec : infall ] has shown that infall can occur .",
    "the discussion presented in this section shows that the infall can create the requisite conditions for producing this very hot gas      the x - ray luminosity predicted in our model is also reasonable .",
    "the mechanical luminosity of the wind @xmath163 is a factor of @xmath164 greater than @xmath165 for this star . even if we assume the appropriate velocity for use is not the full terminal velocity , but rather @xmath166 km  s@xmath3 , similar to the observed wind velocities at distances typical of our model clumps , we still have @xmath167 .",
    "thus the ensemble of clumps need only convert @xmath168 of the wind mechanical luminosity to x - ray luminosity to match the observed @xmath165 .",

    "if we assume an efficiency of @xmath179 for conversion of kinetic energy to x - ray luminosity in the _ rosat _  bandpass ( see , e.g. , wilson & raymond 1999 ) , then the total number of clumps required by the x - ray observations is of order @xmath180 .",
    "the observed luminosity of the hard component is significantly lower than the total ( @xmath181 ergs s@xmath3 ; ccw ) , in qualitative agreement with the temperature distributions shown in the insets of figures [ fig : tempdist1 ] and [ fig : tempdist2 ] .",
    "we can estimate a lower limit to the number of clumps from the lack of ( short - term ) variability in the observed x - rays ( ccm ) .",
    "the population of clumps that exist in the wind at any one time ( @xmath33 ) should be large enough to produce x - ray variations less than @xmath182 , or @xmath183 clumps .",
    "assuming 600 clumps of mass @xmath184 with lifetimes similar to those in table [ table : traj ] , @xmath185 hours , this yields a creation rate of mass in clumps of @xmath186 m@xmath10 yr@xmath3 . assuming half of the clumps",
    "actually escape in the wind ( follow outflow trajectories ) , the mass loss rate in clumps is @xmath187 of m.    another constraint on the number of clumps residing in the stellar wind of @xmath0  sco  comes from the o@xmath1vi  absorption line profile .",
    "the @xmath188   profile shows @xmath189 absorption near @xmath190 km  s@xmath3 .",
    "assuming the o@xmath1vi  optical depth for an individual clump is much larger than unity and , as above , that the clumps are at a distance @xmath191 with mass @xmath192 , approximately @xmath193 clumps are required to cover 10% of the total solid angle of the star .",
    "this corresponds to a mass loss rate of @xmath194 m@xmath10 yr@xmath3  for assumed lifetimes @xmath195 hours .",
    "if the efficiency of mechanical to x - ray luminosity from the previous paragraph is @xmath189 , these two estimates of the number of clumps are in agreement .",
    "it is worth noting that the infall trajectories are naturally weighted to provide more absorption near @xmath196 km  s@xmath3 , i.e. , near the upper - most point in the trajectory , than at larger infall velocities .",
    "this can be seen in figure [ fig : tempdist1 ] where we have plotted a dot every 1.25 hours along the clump s trajectory .",
    "the high density of dots near the turning points implies that a random sample of clumps drawn from from this trajectory will be heavily weighted towards low velocities , in agreement with the gaussian shape of the o@xmath1vi  absorption .",
    "detailed line - profile calculations will be the subject of a future work .",
    "our calculations suggest that the required number of clumps in the wind of @xmath0  sco  is of order @xmath180 , with m@xmath197 approximately @xmath198 m@xmath10 yr@xmath3 , consistent with the adopted mass loss rate of this star .",
    "these rough numbers can vary significantly depending on the assumptions made , however . at the present time there is no clear evidence for an inconsistency with the observational constraints .",
    "further work will need to place more stringent constraints on the allowable parameters of this model .",
    "though our simple model can explain several of the observational aspects of the stellar wind of @xmath0  sco , there are several questions and details that we have not approached .",
    "principal among these is what makes @xmath0  sco  so special ?",
    "why do most hot stars not show the observed peculiarities of this star ?",
    "this is may be due to the special location of @xmath0  sco  on the main sequence where the mass loss rate steeply drops with @xmath199 .",
    "main sequence stars hotter than b0 , i.e. , the main sequence o stars , have mass loss rates considerably higher than @xmath0  sco . for instance , the mass loss rate of o9 v stars with @xmath200 k , @xmath201 , and @xmath202 are of order @xmath203 m@xmath10 yr@xmath3  ( predicted by the cak theory ) , compared with less than @xmath204 or @xmath205 m@xmath10 yr@xmath3  for b1.5 and later stars .",
    "this is observed in the sudden disappearance of the p cygni profiles of the uv resonance lines in stars between o9.5v and b0.5v ( see the atlas of uv line profiles of snow et al .",
    "the mass loss rates of b1.5 v stars are typically a factor of @xmath206 below @xmath0  sco  ( e.g. , the stars in ccm ) , with b2 star mass loss rates often being a factor of 100 lower than that adopted for @xmath0  sco .",
    "we speculate that the prevailing conditions for stars near the position of @xmath0  sco  in the hr diagram are just right not only for the formation of dense clumps of material within the wind , but also for their ability to infall .",
    "stellar winds near the spectral type of @xmath0  sco  are only marginally able to be driven by the radiation of the underlying stars .",
    "clumps with no organized velocity gradient formed in such winds are less likely to be pushed outward than in the winds of earlier - type stars .    to investigate the differences between @xmath0  sco  and earlier - type o stars , we have calculated trajectories for high - density clumps in the wind of the o9  v star 10 lacertae .",

    "we note that like @xmath0  sco , 10 lac has a low projected rotation velocity ( @xmath213 km  s@xmath3 ) .",
    "we find no infall trajectories for initial distances from the stellar surface @xmath214 , initial relative velocities @xmath215 , and masses in the range @xmath216 .",
    "this is primarily a function of the increased luminosity to mass ratio of the star , though the extra drag force plays a limited role .",
    "this explains the lack of red - shifted absorption components of o@xmath1vi  in the spectrum of 10 lac .",
    "our calculations show that clumps in the wind of 10 lac will have shock jump velocities in excess of 1000 km  s@xmath3 , producing temperatures in excess of @xmath4 k. this is very close to the value of @xmath217 found for shocks in `` normal '' stellar winds",
    ". the emission from ( outflowing ) clumps in the wind of 10 lac will be indistinguishable from the normal x - ray flux due to shocks in unstable stellar winds of o - stars .",
    "the lack of redshifted absorption profiles in the uv lines of main sequence stars of spectral type b0.5 and later is due to drastic decrease in mass loss .",
    "a simple scaling of the optical depth of the o@xmath1vi  lines by a factor 0.1 compared to @xmath0  sco , due to a ten times lower mass loss rate , makes these lines undetectable in the _ copernicus _ spectra , though few such stars were observed with _",
    "the significantly lower mass loss rates of later - type stars may not provide the requisite conditions for formation of an ensemble of clumps like those thought to exist in the wind of @xmath0  sco . in general we would expect fewer , lower mass , clumps to form in the winds of later type stars .",
    "such clumps would be less dense than their counterparts in the wind of @xmath0  sco , hence more likely to flow outward .",
    "in the winds of later - type b stars , with significantly lower densities and terminal velocities , the clumps would produce lower temperature and lower luminosity x - rays , perhaps undetectable or indistinguishable from the expected shock emission .",
    "we have outlined a model to explain the two peculiar observational properties of the stellar wind of @xmath0  sco : infall of high - density clumps surrounded by very highly - ionized gas that gives rise to the red - shifted absorption wings of the o@xmath1vi  lines , and strong shocks that produce the hard x - ray spectrum .",
    "our model hypothesizes that density enhancements in the stellar wind lead to the formation of dense clumps of material , confined by ram pressure , that decouple from the dynamical flow of the ambient stellar wind .",
    "these clumps have very large optical depths in the uv resonance lines responsible for driving the stellar wind .",
    "the resulting radiative acceleration of the clumps is insufficient to overcome the gravity , so they slow down and fall back towards the star . as they do so",
    ", their interaction with the on - rushing stellar wind produces a bow shock , with shock temperatures reaching several times @xmath4 k.    we have presented detailed dynamical models of density enhancements in the wind of @xmath0  sco , which show that infall can be achieved for a wide range of initial conditions . using these trajectories",
    "we have shown that the shock - jump velocities can approach 2000 km  s@xmath3 .",
    "the anomolously hard x - rays observed from @xmath0  sco  by cassinelli et  al.(1994 ) and ccw are produced in these bow shocks at temperatures of @xmath218 k. the infalling high - ionization material observed in the o@xmath1vi  doublet by lamers & rogerson ( 1978 ) is material in and around the infalling clumps that is ionized by the hard x - rays produced in the bow shocks at the clumps leading edges .",
    "our calculations show that clumps with masses in the range of @xmath219 to @xmath220 g will fall back if they are formed at radii @xmath221 ( see table 2 ) .",
    "only the clumps formed above 1.1 @xmath98 produce shocks with temperatures in excess of @xmath222 k. clumps formed this high have maximum infall velocities of order 500 km  s@xmath3 .",
    "this is higher than the observed maximum redshift of 250 km  s@xmath3 , but the clumps spend very little time at such high velocities . even clumps with a large final infall velocity will give the maximum contribution to the the uv line profile at small velocities , because they spend much more time near their turning point , where @xmath223 , than at high velocity just before they disappear into the photosphere .",
    "this explains why the o@xmath1vi  absorption reaches a maximum near 0 km  s@xmath3 .",
    "we estimate that @xmath224 clumps of mass @xmath225 g are needed to explain the observed o@xmath1vi  absorption lines and the hard x - ray flux .",
    "this corresponds to a clump mass loss rate of m@xmath226 . in making these estimates",
    "we have assumed several efficiency factors whose values are not well known at present and would require detailed modelling to be improved . for instance , ( a ) in comparing the predicted x - ray luminosities with observations we have assumed a perfect conversion of ram pressure heating to x - ray emission ; ( b ) we have neglected the radiative cooling of shocks which may result in a reduction of the predicted x - ray flux from an individual clump ; and ( c ) we have assumed that the clumps are optically thick in the o@xmath1vi  transitions , and that the intrinsic line widths of the clumps is sufficient to account for the breadth of the observed absorption .",
    "a reduction in these `` efficiencies '' may result in an increase in the required number of clumps .",
    "this will be the subject of a subsequent study .",
    "we explain the special situation of @xmath0  sco  in terms of its location on the main sequence where the mass loss rate drops by about factor 100 from o9 v to b1 v. this can be tested and our model can be improved by high s / n observations of the far uv resonance lines of o@xmath1vi , , and of a number of o9.5 v to b1 v stars with the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ ( _ fuse _ ) .",
    "this satellite will cover the wavelength range @xmath227   and will observe a large number of early - type stars .",
    "our model would suggest that stars with spectral types similar to @xmath0  sco  should also show infall in the o@xmath1vi  doublet at @xmath228 and 1038  , which will be well observed with _",
