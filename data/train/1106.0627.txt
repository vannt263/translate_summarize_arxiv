    "the upshot of the new approach is a possible explanation of primeval stars , the so - called ( hypothetical ) population  iii stars , independent of the existence of cold dark matter ( cdm ) .",
    "bardeen was the first to point out the importance of gauge - invariant variables in the construction of a perturbation theory . in his seminal article  @xcite",
    "bardeen demonstrated that the use of gauge - invariant variables ensures that a perturbation theory is free of spurious solutions .",
    "the article of bardeen has inspired the pioneering works of ellis _",
    "et  al . _",
    "@xcite and mukhanov _",
    "et  al . _",
    "these researchers proposed alternative perturbation theories .",
    "although lifshitz and khalatnikov were aware of the fact that the system of perturbation equations can be divided into three independent systems of equations , namely for tensor perturbations ( gravitational waves ) , vector perturbations ( vortexes ) , and scalar perturbations , they did not explicitly use the decompositions ( [ eq : h123 ] ) and ( [ eq : decomp - u ] ) found by york  @xcite , stewart  @xcite and stewart and walker  @xcite .",
    "these decompositions make the computations much more tractable .",
    "an important result  @xcite is that the perturbed metric tensor for scalar perturbations can be written in terms of two potentials ( [ decomp - hij - par ] ) .",
    "this facilitates the derivation of the newtonian results ( [ eq : poisson ] ) and ( [ eq : newt - ngi ] ) in the non - relativistic limit .",
    "in addition to the results found in the literature , some new insights , described in this article , are used .",
    "firstly , barotropic equations of state for the pressure @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the energy density , are commonly used in cosmology  @xcite . in particular , the linear barotropic equation of state @xmath3 , with @xmath4 in the radiation - dominated era and @xmath5 in the era after decoupling of matter and radiation , describes very well the global evolution of an _ _ un__perturbed flrw universe .",
    "as will become clear in section  [ sec : stand - theory ] , @xmath3 gives an incomplete description of the evolution of density perturbations in the _ perturbed _ universe .",
    "therefore , realistic equations of state are needed . from thermodynamics",
    "it is known that both the energy density @xmath2 and the pressure @xmath6 depend on the independent quantities @xmath7 and @xmath8 , i.e. , @xmath9 where @xmath7 is the particle number density and @xmath8 the temperature . since @xmath8 can , in principle , be eliminated from these equations of state , a computationally more convenient equation of state for the pressure will be used , namely @xmath10 this , non - barotropic , equation of state has been included in the new perturbation theory ( [ subeq : final ] ) . therefore , this theory will be referred to as the _ generalised lifshitz - khalatnikov _ theory .",
    "secondly , for scalar perturbations the three perturbed momentum constraint equations ( [ basis-2 ] ) can be rewritten as one evolution equation ( [ frw6 ] ) for the local perturbation @xmath11 , ( [ driekrom ] ) , to the global spatial curvature @xmath12 , ( [ eq : glob - curve ] ) .",
    "since , in first - order , only the _ irrotational _ part of the spatial part of the fluid four - velocity is coupled to scalar perturbations , the three momentum conservation laws ( [ basis-5 ] ) can be recast in one evolution equation ( [ frw5 ] ) for the divergence @xmath13 , ( [ fes5 ] ) , of the spatial part of the fluid four - velocity . using the variables @xmath11 and @xmath13 , the evolution equations for scalar perturbations can be written as an initial value problem ( [ subeq : pertub - flrw ] ) with four _ ordinary _ differential equations and one algebraic equation , to be obeyed by the initial values .",
    "the only gradient term in this system occurs in equation ( [ frw5 ] ) .",
    "this is a distinct advantage over former perturbation theories  @xcite which contain metric gradients .",
    "thirdly , since the sets of equations ( [ subeq : einstein - flrw ] ) and ( [ subeq : pertub - flrw ] ) are written with respect to the _ same _ system of reference , one can draw the conclusion that only three independent scalars , namely the energy density @xmath2 , the particle number density @xmath7 and the expansion scalar @xmath14 , play a role in a perturbation theory .",
    "this reduces the number of possible gauge - invariant variables considerably , and , thereupon , leads to the insight that there exist two , and only two , unique gauge - invariant quantities @xmath15 and @xmath16 , defined by ( [ e - n - gi ] ) .    finally , in order to show that @xmath15 and @xmath16 are indeed the perturbations to the energy density and particle number density , respectively , one has to investigate the basic equations ( [ subeq : pertub - flrw ] ) for scalar perturbations together with the definitions ( [ e - n - gi ] ) in the so - called _ non - relativistic limit_. in this limit , which will be defined in exact terms in section  [ sec : newt - limit ] , the set ( [ subeq : pertub - flrw ] ) combined with the definitions ( [ e - n - gi ] ) reduce to the newtonian theory of gravity , i.e. , the newtonian results ( [ eq : poisson ] ) and ( [ eq : newt - ngi ] ) show up .",
    "therefore , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the real , physical , energy density perturbation and the particle number density perturbation , respectively .",
    "consequently , the generalised lifshitz - khalatnikov theory ( [ subeq : final ] ) , which is derived from ( [ subeq : pertub - flrw ] ) using ( [ e - n - gi ] ) , is a manifestly covariant and gauge - invariant perturbation theory and describes unequivocally the evolution of density perturbations in flrw universes .",
    "firstly , it follows from the generalised lifshitz - khalatnikov theory that perturbations in the total energy density are _ gravitationally _ coupled to perturbations in the particle number density ( [ fir - ord ] ) , irrespective of the nature of the particles ( i.e. , ordinary matter or cdm ) and independent of the scale of the perturbations .",
    "secondly , in the radiation - dominated era of a flat flrw universe small - scale perturbations oscillate with an _ increasing _ amplitude according to ( [ dc - small ] ) , whereas the standard evolution equation ( [ eq : delta - standard ] ) predicts oscillatory perturbations with a _ constant _ amplitude .",
    "this difference is due to the fact that in the new perturbation theory the divergence @xmath13 , ( [ fes5 ] ) , of the spatial part of the fluid four - velocity has been taken into account , whereas @xmath17 in the standard theory , compare the newtonian equation ( [ eq : delta - standard ] ) with the exact relativistic equations ( [ subeq : standard ] ) . in the evolution of large - scale perturbations",
    "@xmath13 plays only a minor role , so that the results of the standard theory are recovered ( [ delta - h - rad ] ) .",
    "heat exchange does not play a role in the radiation - dominated era .",
    "finally , in the era after decoupling of matter and radiation , heat loss , section  [ sec : diabatic ] , of a perturbation , in addition to gravity , has a more or less favourable effect on its growth rate , depending on the scale",
    ". for large - scale perturbations heat loss is unimportant and gravity is the main cause of contraction .",
    "therefore , the generalised lifshitz - khalatnikov theory corroborates the results for large - scale perturbations ( [ eq : new - dust-53-adiabatic ] ) of former perturbation theories which did not take heat loss into account .",
    "small - scale perturbations benefit more from heat loss during their evolution than large - scale perturbations do .",
    "it is shown in section  [ sec : hier - struc ] that for perturbations with scales around @xmath18 gravity and heat loss combine optimally , figure  [ fig : collapse ] , resulting in fast growing density perturbations .",
    "this may shed new light on the evolution of small - scale inhomogeneities in the universe .",
    "in this section the generalised lifshitz - khalatnikov theory of cosmological density perturbations is derived for the open , flat or closed flrw universe . to that end , a suitable system of reference must be chosen .",
    "due to the general covariance of the einstein equations and conservation laws , einstein s gravitational theory is invariant under a general coordinate transformation @xmath19 , implying that preferred coordinate systems do not exist ( weinberg  @xcite , appendix  b ) . in particular ,",
    "the linearised einstein equations and conservation laws are invariant under a general linear coordinate transformation @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are four arbitrary , first - order ( infinitesimal ) functions of the time ( @xmath23 ) and space [ @xmath24 coordinates . since preferred systems of reference",
    "do not exist and since the final result ( [ subeq : final ] ) is manifestly covariant and gauge - invariant , one may use any suitable and convenient coordinate system to perform the calculations . in order to put an accurate interpretation on the new gauge - invariant quantities ( [ subeq : gi - quant ] )",
    "one needs the non - relativistic limit . in the newtonian theory of gravity all possible systems of reference are _",
    "synchronous_. therefore , synchronous coordinates  @xcite , i.e. , @xmath25 , will be used in the background as well as in the perturbed universe . for convenience ,",
    "synchronous coordinates are chosen such that coordinate time is equal to proper time , i.e. , @xmath26 .      in synchronous",
    "coordinates the metric of flrw universes has the form @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the scale factor of the universe , and @xmath29 is the metric of the three - dimensional maximally symmetric subspaces of constant time .",
    "the functions @xmath30 and @xmath31 of the general infinitesimal transformation ( [ func ] ) reduce to @xmath32 if only transformations between synchronous coordinates are allowed . in ( [ eq :",
    "synchronous ] ) , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are four arbitrary , infinitesimal functions of the spatial coordinates .      the complete set of zeroth - order einstein equations and conservation laws for an open , flat or closed flrw universe filled with a perfect fluid with energy - momentum tensor @xmath35 is , in synchronous coordinates , given by    [ subeq : einstein - flrw ] @xmath36    the @xmath37 constraint equations and the @xmath38 , @xmath39 , dynamical equations are identically satisfied .",
    "the @xmath40 dynamical equations are equivalent to the time - derivative of the @xmath41 constraint equation ( [ frw3 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the @xmath38 dynamical equations need not be taken into account . in equations  ( [ subeq : einstein - flrw ] ) @xmath42 is the cosmological constant , @xmath43 the gravitational constant of the newtonian theory of gravity , @xmath44 the speed of light and @xmath45 a shorthand notation for the quotient @xmath46 .",

    "furthermore , @xmath49 is the hubble function which is equal to @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the background value of the expansion scalar @xmath52 with @xmath53 the four - velocity , normalised to unity ( @xmath54 ) .",

    "since the work of lifshitz and khalatnikov , it is known that for flrw universes the set ( [ subeq : basis ] ) can be broken down into three independent systems of equations , namely a system for gravitational waves ( tensor perturbations ) , for vortexes ( vector perturbations ) , and for scalar perturbations .",
    "in addition they showed that only scalar perturbations are coupled to density perturbations .",
    "lifshitz and khalatnikov used spherical harmonics to classify the three types of perturbations .",
    "a disadvantage of their approach is that using spherical harmonics is computationally demanding . a new insight , gained in 1974 by york  @xcite , and in 1990 elucidated by stewart  @xcite , makes the computations much more tractable .",
    "york and stewart showed that the symmetric perturbation tensor @xmath85 can uniquely be decomposed into three parts , i.e. , @xmath86 where the scalar , vector and tensor perturbations are denoted by @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 , respectively .",

    "the three different kinds of perturbations will now be considered according to the decompositions ( [ eq : h123 ] ) and ( [ eq : decomp - u ] ) , and their properties ( [ eq : prop - hij ] ) and ( [ eq : nabla - u ] ) .    for tensor perturbations the properties ( [ eq : prop - hij ] ) imply that @xmath99 , as follows from ( [ driekrom ] ) . using this and ( [ eq : prop - hij ] ) ,",
    "equations ( [ basis-1])([basis-3 ] ) imply that tensor perturbations are not coupled to @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath95 .",
    "the perturbed ricci tensor , @xmath102 , being a symmetric tensor , should obey the decomposition ( [ eq : h123 ] ) with the properties ( [ eq : prop - hij ] ) , namely @xmath103 .",
    "this implies that , see ( [ driekrom ] ) , @xmath104 must obey @xmath105 , in addition to @xmath106 . from ( [ basis-1 ] ) and the trace of ( [ basis-3 ] ) it follows that vector perturbations are not coupled to @xmath100 and @xmath101 . raising the index @xmath107 of equation ( [ basis-2 ] ) with @xmath70",
    ", one finds that this equation reads for vector perturbations @xmath108 where it is used that @xmath109 . taking the covariant derivative of ( [ basis-2-raise ] ) with respect to the index",
    "@xmath110 one finds with the additional property @xmath105 that equation ( [ basis-2-raise ] ) reduces to @xmath111 , implying with ( [ eq : nabla - u ] ) that the constituent @xmath112 is coupled to vector perturbations .    since both @xmath113 and @xmath114 , scalar perturbations are coupled to @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "it will now be demonstrated that @xmath115 is coupled to scalar perturbations , by showing that equation ( [ basis-2 ] ) requires that the rotation of @xmath95 vanishes , if the metric is of the form ( [ decomp - hij - par ] ) . differentiating ( [ basis-2 ] ) covariantly with respect to the index @xmath110 and substituting ( [ decomp - hij - par ] ) yields @xmath116 interchanging  @xmath107 and  @xmath110 and subtracting the result from  ( [ eq : feiko1 ] ) one gets @xmath117 by rearranging the covariant derivatives , ( [ dr0i2-rot ] ) can be cast in the form @xmath118 using the expressions for the commutator of second order covariant derivatives ( weinberg  @xcite , chapter  6 , section  5 ) @xmath119 and substituting the background riemann tensor for the three - spaces of constant time @xmath120 one finds that the left - hand side of equation ( [ eq : verwissel ] ) vanishes identically , implying that the rotation of @xmath95 is zero .",

    "the left - hand side of ( [ dr0i4 ] ) will turn up as a part of the time - derivative of the curvature @xmath11 .",

    "since the sets ( [ subeq : standard ] ) and ( [ subeq : new - pwe ] ) are both derived from the basic perturbation equations ( [ subeq : pertub - gi ] ) , the physical part of @xmath13 vanishes also in the set ( [ subeq : new - pwe ] ) for @xmath444 .",
    "therefore , the sets ( [ subeq : standard ] ) and ( [ subeq : new - pwe ] ) should yield , apart from the gauge modes , exactly the same solution .",
    "indeed , the solutions of ( [ eq : delta - standard - genrel - pwe ] ) are the modes @xmath336 and @xmath449 . ignoring the decaying solutions , the three equations ( [ eq : delta - standard ] ) , ( [ subeq : standard ] ) and ( [ subeq : new - pwe ] ) yield exactly the same result , namely _ growing _ density perturbations with a _ scale - independent _ growth rate",
    ". this result can not be correct for the following two reasons .",
    "firstly , since there is no fluid flow , i.e. , @xmath447 , in the limit @xmath173 , perturbations do not grow and the gravitational field is static ( [ frw6gi - flat - newt ] ) .",
    "secondly , given two energy density perturbations with the same energy density @xmath450 , then the large - scale perturbation has a stronger gravitational field than a small - scale perturbation . as a consequence ,",
    "growth rates are scale - dependent .",
    "the incorrect results of equations ( [ eq : delta - standard ] ) , ( [ subeq : standard ] ) and ( [ subeq : new - pwe ] ) are due to the equation of state ( [ eq : state - restrictive ] ) , which is incomplete and , therefore , does not describe the cosmic fluid adequately in the perturbed universe after decoupling .",
    "since the generalised lifshitz - khalatnikov theory ( [ subeq : final ] ) is adapted to the realistic , non - barotropic , equation of state for the pressure @xmath187 , it does not have the above mentioned disadvantages of the standard perturbation theory ( [ eq : delta - standard ] ) and equations ( [ subeq : standard ] ) and ( [ subeq : new - pwe ] ) .",
    "firstly , the equations of state ( [ state - mat ] ) yield for the quantity @xmath451 , ( [ eq : beta - matter ] ) , the correct , time - dependent , speed of sound ( [ coef - nu1 ] ) , whereas @xmath427 is constant for an equation of state @xmath3 .",
    "secondly , it follows from figure  [ fig : collapse ] that in the new perturbation theory the growth rate depends on the scale of a perturbation , as it should be .",
    "there is a sharp lower limit , namely @xmath18 , below which density perturbations do not grow at all ( [ eq : small - scale - dust ] ) .",
    "recall that @xmath452 is the _ irrotational _ part of the three - space fluid velocity .",
    "the rotational part of @xmath452 is not coupled to density perturbations and need , therefore , not be considered .",
