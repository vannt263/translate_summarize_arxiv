    "for @xmath0 a closed surface and @xmath16 a generic immersion , we will be interested in the connected components of @xmath2 .",
    "they will be called the _ complementary regions _ of @xmath12 , or simply the _ regions _ of @xmath12 .",
    "choose one point @xmath17 and color it black .",
    "this determines a color black or white for any point in @xmath2 according to the following prescription : if @xmath18 we connect @xmath19 to @xmath20 with a curve @xmath21 in general position with respect to @xmath22 , and we color @xmath19 black or white according to whether @xmath21 intersects @xmath22 an even or odd number of times , respectively .",
    "this is indeed well defined by simple connectivity of @xmath23 .",
    "the color of points within one region is constant and so we may refer to the color of a region , and this color changes whenever crossing a sheet of @xmath22 from one region to a neighboring one",
    ". we will be interested in the collection of euler characteristics that may appear for the set of regions , so we first prove :    [ l1 ] if @xmath24 is a complementary region of @xmath1 then @xmath25 .",
    "let @xmath26 be the natural notion of a boundary for @xmath24 .",
    "it is enough to show that @xmath26 is connected , since then @xmath27 and so @xmath28 .",
    "so assume @xmath26 has at least two connected components @xmath29 , and let @xmath30 be a surface parallel to @xmath31 .",
    "there is a path in @xmath24 from @xmath31 to @xmath32 crossing @xmath33 precisely once , and since @xmath22 is connected and disjoint from @xmath33 , this path can be completed to a loop in @xmath23 crossing @xmath33 precisely once , contradicting the simple connectivity of @xmath23 .",
    "given a generic immersion @xmath1 , color @xmath2 as above , and we define two sequences @xmath34 and @xmath35 of non - negative integers as follows : let @xmath36 be the number of black regions @xmath24 with @xmath37 and let @xmath38 be the number of white regions @xmath24 with @xmath37 .",
    "we attach two more integers to such immersion , the number @xmath39 of triple points of @xmath12 , and @xmath40 .",
    "our goal in this work is to determine what sets of data @xmath41 may arise in this way .",
    "we will prove :    [ main ] let @xmath42 , @xmath43 be two sequences of non - negative integers which are not identically 0 .",
    "let @xmath44 and @xmath13 be integers satisfying @xmath45 , @xmath46 .",
    "then there is a closed surface @xmath0 with @xmath47 and an immersion @xmath1 with @xmath13 triple points which realizes the sequences @xmath48 , iff the following equation holds : @xmath49    the `` only if '' part of theorem main will be proved in section onif and the `` if '' part in section if .",
    "in this section we show that any immersion @xmath1 satisfies the equalities of theorem main .",
    "this has been shown for orientable surfaces in f using an elaborate order 1 invariant appearing there .",
    "we will present a self contained proof which covers both orientable and non - orientable surfaces . for generic immersion @xmath50",
    "let @xmath51 be the union of all black regions and @xmath52 the union of all white regions of @xmath12 , then @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "we now define @xmath55 and @xmath56 by @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( this may be a half integer ) .",
    "our goal is then to show that for any immersion @xmath1 , @xmath59 .",
    "we will show this by first showing that @xmath55 and @xmath56 are constant along regular homotopies , and then verifying the equalities for one chosen immersion in every regular homotopy class .    along a generic regular homotopy",
    ", there are some finitely many times when the topology of the complementary regions may change , namely , at the times when the regular homotopy passes through non - stable immersion .",
    "there are four types of such occurrences , which we name @xmath60 .",
    "they appear in figure 1 , and a model immersion in @xmath61 for each configuration is given below , depending on a parameter @xmath62 .",
    "the immersions depicted in figure 1 correspond to some @xmath63 , and the unstable immersion corresponds to @xmath64 .",
    "we will now see that for each of the four types of occurrences , if we continuously carry the coloring along the regular homotopy , by keeping it fixed on points which are remote from the given occurrence , then the topology of the regions and the number of triple points change in a way such that @xmath65 remain constant .",
    "model for @xmath66 :  @xmath67 ,  @xmath68 .",
    "when moving from @xmath63 to @xmath69 a new 3-cell region appears .",
    "say this region is black then it adds 1 to @xmath55 .",
    "the second change occurring , is that the region just above the plane @xmath67 has a 2-handle removed from it .",
    "this region is seen to be black , since one needs to cross both sheets involved in the configuration in order to pass from this region into the new 3-cell . and",
    "so all together @xmath55 remains fixed .",
    "the topology of the white regions has remained unchanged and so @xmath56 remains fixed as well .",
    "model for @xmath70 :   @xmath67 ,  @xmath71 .",
    "the changes occurring in the neighboring regions when passing from @xmath63 to @xmath69 are that a 1-handle is removed from the region @xmath72 just above the @xmath73 axis , and a 1-handle is added to the region @xmath74 just below the @xmath75 axis .",
    "it is seen that the color of these two regions is the same since they are on opposite sides of both sheets involved in the configuration , and so @xmath65 remain fixed .",
    "model for @xmath33 :  @xmath67 ,  @xmath76 ,  @xmath77 .",
    "when passing from @xmath63 to @xmath69 a new 3-cell region appears .",
    "the second change occurring is that a 1-handle is removed from the region near the @xmath73 axis having negative @xmath75 values and positive @xmath78 values .",
    "the color of this region is seen to be opposite to that of the new 3-cell , since it is on the other side of all three sheets involved in the configuration , and so @xmath79 and @xmath80 both increase by 1 .",
    "but on the other hand , two triple points are added to @xmath12 during this occurrence , and so all together both @xmath55 and @xmath56 remained fixed .",
    "model for @xmath81 :  @xmath67 ,  @xmath76 ,  @xmath82 ,  @xmath83 .",
    "when passing from @xmath84 to @xmath69 , a simplex region vanishes , and a new simplex region appears .",
    "they are of the same color since they are on the opposite side of all four sheets involved in the configuration .",
    "all other regions are topologically unchanged and so again , @xmath55 and @xmath56 remain fixed .    we have thus shown that @xmath55 and @xmath56 are constant on every regular homotopy class . it remains to find this value by direct inspection of one immersion in every regular homotopy class , and see that indeed @xmath85 .",
    "it is shown in p that if @xmath0 is orientable then any immersion @xmath86 is regularly homotopic to either a standard embedding , or a standard embedding with an additional `` ring '' added along a particular circle in the surface .",
    "( a ring along a trivial circle is seen in figure 3b ) .",
    "it follows that the same is true for immersions in @xmath23 . for a standard embedding the regions on the two sides indeed",
    "have @xmath87 .",
    "if a ring is added , this adds a solid torus region , whose @xmath44 is 0 , and it does not change the topology of the previously existing regions , and so the equalities still hold .",
    "it is further shown in p that if @xmath0 is non - orientable , then any immersion @xmath86 is regularly homotopic to a connect sum of boy s surfaces ( right and left handed ) , where by connect sum of immersions we mean the following .",
    "if @xmath1 , is an immersion of a closed surface into @xmath23 , and if @xmath88 is a point not in the intersection set of @xmath12 , then let @xmath89 be a small 3-ball neighborhood of @xmath19 disjoint from the intersection set of @xmath12 and delete @xmath89 from @xmath23 , obtaining an immersion @xmath90 where @xmath91 is a disc in @xmath0 . if @xmath92 is another such immersion , do the same with some @xmath93 .",
    "now glue @xmath94 to @xmath95 along their boundaries , so that the boundaries of @xmath96 and @xmath97 will match , obtaining an immersion @xmath98 which we call a connect sum of @xmath99 .",
    "when such connect sum operation is performed , then the two complementary regions of @xmath12 on the two sides of @xmath100 , merge with the corresponding complementary regions of @xmath101 on the two sides of @xmath102 .",
    "each such merger is along a disc , namely , a hemisphere of @xmath103 .    in p boy",
    "s surface is depicted with a small window removed , so one can peak inside and convince one s self that the complementary regions of boy s surface are two 3-cells , one of each color . also , boy s surface has one triple point .",
    "and so the complementary regions of a connect sum of @xmath13 boy s surfaces are still two 3-cells , one of each color , and the number of triple points is @xmath13 . and so @xmath104 .",
    "this completes the proof of the `` only if '' part of theorem main .",
    "we make the following remark .",
    "the `` only if '' part of theorem main is a refinement of what may be deduced in this setting from the result of izumiya and marar ( i m ) , namely @xmath105 . indeed , present @xmath23 as the union of a regular neighborhood @xmath24 of @xmath22 , and the union @xmath106 of all complementary regions , slightly diminished , so @xmath107 .",
    "we get @xmath108 , or @xmath109 .",
    "this shows that the izumiya marar equality is equivalent in this setting to @xmath110 , which is the sum of our two equalities @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "in this section we show that any data @xmath41 satisfying the conditions of theorem main , may be realized by some @xmath0 and @xmath12 .",
    "the proof is by induction on @xmath113 .",
    "let @xmath41 be data satisfying the conditions of theorem main .",
    "if @xmath114 and there is @xmath115 with @xmath116 , then let @xmath117 be the sequence obtained from @xmath118 by subtracting 1 from @xmath119 , subtracting 1 from @xmath120 , and then adding 1 to @xmath121 .",
    "( so if @xmath122 then @xmath123 ) .",
    "if @xmath118 satisfies the conditions of theorem main , then so does @xmath124 , and we have @xmath125 . by induction",
    "there is a surface @xmath0 and immersion @xmath1 realizing @xmath126 .",
    "let @xmath24 be a black complementary region for @xmath12 with @xmath127 , and change @xmath12 in a disc on the boundary of @xmath24 ( which is disjoint from the intersection set of @xmath12 ) as in figure 2 .",
    "then @xmath128 decreases by 1 , and there is a new black 3-cell region appearing .",
    "the topology of all other regions is unchanged , and so the new immersion realizes @xmath41 .",
    "so we may assume that either ( i ) @xmath129 , or ( ii ) @xmath130 for all @xmath131 .",
    "by the same argument , the same may be assumed for @xmath132 .",
    "if say @xmath118 satisfies ( i ) and @xmath132 satisfies ( ii ) , then @xmath133 , and since the sequences are assumed not to be identically 0 , @xmath134 , and so they can not be equal .",
    "it follows that we may assume either both @xmath48 satisfy ( i ) or both satisfy ( ii ) .",
    "we will first assume both sequences satisfy ( i ) , that is @xmath135 , and so @xmath136 , and so necessarily @xmath137 .",
    "if @xmath138 , then by induction we have a surface and immersion @xmath12 realizing @xmath139 .",
    "take the connect sum of @xmath12 with boy s surface , then since boy s surface has 1 triple point and one complementary 3-cell of each color , the new immersion realizes @xmath41 .",
    "so we may assume @xmath140 .    before dealing with this case , we introduce two more operations on immersions .",
    "let @xmath12 be an immersion and let @xmath141 be a disc disjoint from the intersection set of @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath142 is part of the boundary of two neighboring regions @xmath143 ( of opposite color ) . for @xmath144 , a @xmath145-operation on @xmath142",
    "is an operation as in figure 3a , adding @xmath145 handles to @xmath0 , by this reducing @xmath146 by @xmath147 , and reducing @xmath148 each by @xmath145 .",
    "we will say that this @xmath145-operation was performed on the pair @xmath143 .",
    "the second operation will be called a ring operation , which is adding a _ ring _ on @xmath142 , say on the side of @xmath24 , as in figure 3b .",
    "( only the immersion changes here , not the topology of the surface . )",
    "the only effect of a ring operation is the creation of a new solid torus region which is a neighbor of @xmath24 , and so of color opposite that of @xmath24 .",
    "the topology of all previously existing regions remains unchanged .",
    "we will say that this ring operation was performed in the region @xmath24 .    back to our sequences @xmath48 ,",
    "recall that we are now assuming @xmath135 , @xmath140 .",
    "assume first that the following holds : there is a @xmath19 such that @xmath149 for all @xmath150 , and so ( since the sequences are not identically 0 ) @xmath151 , @xmath152 . if @xmath153 , then by our equalities , @xmath154 .",
    "start with a standard embedding of a torus , and perform @xmath155 ring operations in the white side and @xmath156 ring operations in the black side , obtaining an immersion realizing the data .",
    "so we may assume @xmath157 and so necessarily @xmath158 .",
    "if @xmath159 , then @xmath160 and we may realize our data by a standard embedding of an orientable surface @xmath0 of genus @xmath19 .",
    "otherwise @xmath161 .",
    "let @xmath162 , @xmath163 be the sequences with @xmath164 and @xmath165 for all @xmath150 , and note that necessarily @xmath166 . by induction we have an immersion @xmath12 realizing @xmath167 .",
    "now perform a ring operation on @xmath12 in some arbitrary place , creating a new solid torus region @xmath24 . in @xmath24",
    "perform another ring operation creating another solid torus region @xmath106 which is a neighbor of @xmath24 ( and so of opposite color ) . now perform a @xmath168-operation on the pair @xmath143 to obtain an immersion realizing @xmath169 .    if there is no @xmath19 as above , then there are some @xmath170 such that @xmath116 and @xmath171 , and assume @xmath172 .",
    "let @xmath173 be the sequences obtained from @xmath48 in the following way .",
    "subtract 1 from @xmath120 , subtract 1 from @xmath174 and then add 1 to @xmath175 ( so if @xmath122 then the sequence @xmath132 remains unchanged . )",
    "the sequence @xmath117 is not identically 0 since that would imply that @xmath176 which could not equal @xmath177 .",
    "note also that necessarily @xmath178 . by induction",
    "we may realize @xmath179 .",
    "we have @xmath180 and let @xmath24 be a corresponding region , i.e. @xmath24 is a white region with @xmath181 .",
    "now , first perform a ring operation in @xmath24 , creating a new black solid torus region @xmath106 which is a neighbor of @xmath24 .",
    "then perform an @xmath182-operation on the pair @xmath143 of neighboring regions , by this decreasing @xmath128 and @xmath183 each by @xmath184 , and decreasing @xmath146 by @xmath185 , and so realizing our original data @xmath169 .",
    "( if @xmath122 then the @xmath182-operation means doing nothing . )",
    "we are left with the case both sequences satisfy ( ii ) , that is @xmath149 for all @xmath131 . since the sequences are not identically 0 , @xmath186 and so @xmath187 . if @xmath188 then @xmath189 , and as before we may use a realization of @xmath139 to produce a realization of @xmath41 , so we may assume @xmath190 i.e. the surface @xmath0 is @xmath191 .",
    "so now @xmath192 is a sum of integers and so @xmath13 is even .",
    "our task then , is to construct for any even @xmath13 , an immersion @xmath193 with complementary regions which are @xmath192 3-cells of each color . from the `` only if '' part of theorem main we know that if all complementary regions of an immersion are 3-cells , then necessarily half of them are of each color .",
    "and so when constructing our immersions below , we need only verify that the _ total _ number of 3-cells is @xmath194 .",
    "for @xmath140 take an embedding which indeed gives two 3-cell .",
    "for @xmath195 , we must construct an immersion @xmath193 with 2 triple points and 4 complementary 3-cells .",
    "start with three spheres , each embedded , and intersecting each other with two triple points , as in figure 4a .",
    "they divide @xmath23 into eight 3-cells .",
    "a small neighborhood of one of the two triple points is as appears in figure 4b .",
    "the 8 different regions appearing in this neighborhood , belong to the 8 different complementary regions . in the figure ,",
    "one of these regions is hidden .",
    "we now attach two tubes to the three spheres , merging them into one sphere .",
    "we add the tubes as in figure 5 which we now explain .",
    "the horizontal tube connects the two vertical sheets , and is half way above and half way below the horizontal sheet . the upper half of this tube creates a path merging regions 1 and 3 of figure 4b , and its lower half merges regions 5 and 7 of that figure .",
    "the vertical tube connects the horizontal sheet with the left hand vertical sheet and is half to the left and half to the right of the right hand vertical sheet .",
    "it opens paths merging regions 1 and 6 of figure 4b , and regions 4 and 7 of that figure .",
    "all together , regions 1,3,6 of figure 4b have merged into the one 3-cell region 1 of figure 5 , and regions 4,5,7 of figure 4b have merged into the one 3-cell region 3 of figure 5 .",
    "and so we have four complementary 3-cells as needed .",
    "this completes the case @xmath195 .    for general",
    "even @xmath13 , take a connect sum of @xmath196 copies of the immersion we have constructed for the case @xmath195 .",
    "each additional such immersion adds two new triple points as needed , and two of its four 3-cell regions merge along discs with two of the existing ones , and so precisely two new 3-cell regions are added , as needed ."
