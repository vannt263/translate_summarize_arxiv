    "[ fig : sed ] for two different inclination angles . while the long - wavelength emission from the circumstellar envelope is well reproduced by the models ( and is almost not affected by the viewing angle ) , the short  wavelength emission from the protostellar / disk system is clearly underestimated and strongly depends on inclination .",

    "however , the blue and red  shifted lobes of the co outflow ( fig .",
    "[ fig : irac ] ) appear relatively well separated , and thus the source can not be completely `` pole  in '' @xcite . in summary , the observed sed is peculiar , with a _",

    "the cold dust surrounding the yso has been mapped through its 1.2 mm emission ( fig .  [",
    "fig : mambo ] ) .",
    "as mm continuum emission is generally optically thin , the measured fluxes are proportional to the temperature  weighted mass content assuming that dust grains properties are known . in order to trace the mass distribution in the envelope , the radial intensity profile @xmath45 has been analyzed by averaging the 1.2 mm fluxes within equidistant circular annulus ( fig .",

    "[ fig : profile ] shows that the dust emission in the outer envelope ( @xmath53@xmath545,000au @xmath54one beam ) follows a very steep profile , with @xmath55@xmath31.9 , connecting the envelope with the lower density ambient cloud at @xmath56 .",
    "since the outer envelope angular radii are larger than the beam s fwhm , the convolution does not modify the slope of the intensity profile ( e.g. , adams 1991 ; motte & andr 2001 ) . for the same reason",

    "taking again a dust opacity of @xmath38=0.01@xmath39g@xmath22 and t@xmath37=20k ( consistent with the sed analysis ) we compute a total circumstellar mass of m@xmath59=0.7@xmath11 within @xmath60 .",
    "however , it is unlikely that all this mass can be finally accreted by the protostar / disk .",
    "first because the outflow will disperse a large fraction of it , and second , because differential rotation in the envelope is expected to decouple the inner rapidly infalling and rotating layers from the slowly collapsing and rotating outer regions ( belloche et al .",

    "the steep slope of the 1.2 mm intensity profile suggests that a temperature gradient is also present .",
    "in particular , the dust thermal profile through the inner envelope should be dominated by accretion heating from the protostar / disk system with @xcite : @xmath63 where @xmath64 depends on the dust grain properties through @xmath65 . given the proximity of ced  201 pdr , fuv photons from",
    "bd+69@xmath201231 star also heat the outer layers of iras  22129 + 7000 envelope .",
    "penetration of this external fuv radiation field into the envelope greatly depends on the scattering properties of the dust particles , with larger penetration depths as grains grow toward bigger grains ( goicoechea & le bourlot 2007 ) . in the following we adopt a temperature profile that follows eq .",

    "taking @xmath64=0.36 ( using @xmath41=1.6 from the sed ) and assuming @xmath66 , the estimated mass of the envelope increases by a factor @xmath02 respect to the isothermal case because @xmath67 drops below 20k in a large fraction of the envelope .",
    "this difference adds to the dominant source of uncertainty in the mass determination , the dust composition and associated opacity .",

    "figure [ fig : mtc ] shows the best fits and the density and temperaure gradients used in the model . in spite of the good agreement , the model slightly underestimates the observed hco@xmath6 and c@xmath5o @xmath8=10 linewidths , likely due to a minor contribution from the high velocity outflow ( not modelled here ) .",
    "the resulting large dco@xmath6/hco@xmath6 abundance ratio ( @xmath00.02 ) found in iras  22129 + 7000 is similar to that derived in cold and dense prestellar condensations near other pdrs ( e.g. , pety et al . 2007 ) .",
    "this is consistent for a species that shows enhanced abundance in the cold fuv  shielded gas ( low ionization degree ) affected by ongoing deuterium fractionation ( where dissociative recombinations with electrons are its main destruction route ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the dco@xmath6/hco@xmath6 abundance ratio is roughly inversely proportional to the electrons abundance and we can estimate its value . taking the same gas phase chemical network used by us in pety et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , and assuming a cosmic ionization rate of @xmath106=3@xmath2810@xmath107s@xmath22 @xcite , we derive an ionization fraction of @xmath010@xmath108 ( with respect to h nuclei ) in the densest and coldest regions of the envelope where the dco@xmath6 abundance peaks .",
    "this value is , within a factor @xmath02 , similar to the ionization fraction inferred in prestellar cores such as barnard  68 @xcite .      in the previous section",
    "we have estimated the amount of material towards iras  22129 + 7000 and also evaluated the co line emission contribution from the ambient cloud and from the circumstellar envelope ( through the optically thin c@xmath5o line ) .",
    "after subtracting the co contribution from the above line  of  sight components we now estimate a co column density of @xmath010@xmath109@xmath110 in the outflow .",
    "taking into account the observed dimensions of the blue and red  shifted lobes we compute the mass ( @xmath00.14m@xmath111 ) , momentum ( @xmath01.0m@xmath111kms@xmath22 ) and kinetic energy ( @xmath06.8@xmath2810@xmath112erg ) carried out by the outflow .",
    "note that the mechanical luminosity of the flow ( @xmath00.02l@xmath111 ) is still a significant fraction ( @xmath00.4% ) of the radiant luminosity of the driving source .",
    "the estimated outflow momentum flux is f@xmath113@xmath03@xmath2810@xmath114m@xmath111kms@xmath22yr@xmath22 , although the correction factor for inclination effects ( @xmath115 ) will decrease the actual f@xmath113 if @xmath11640@xmath76 .",
    "hence , f@xmath113 is intermediate between the observed momentum fluxes found in early class  0 sources and those found in late class  i sources ( e.g , bontemps et al .",

    "as noted earlier iras  22129 + 7000 shows indirect evidence of a protostar / disk system ( a collimated outflow ) and it shows extended dust emission from the envelope with a large l@xmath17/l@xmath18 ratio ( @xmath32@xmath19 ) .",
    "these characteristics are consistent with the standard observational definition of class  0 sources ( andr et al . 2000 ) .",
    "comparison of the derived l@xmath18 and m@xmath61 values with theoretical evolutionary tracks @xcite shows that the source is likely in the interesting class 0 to i transition .",
    "approximately 50@xmath19 of the initial mass envelope must have been accreted at this stage . according to these diagrams ,",
    "infall must have started in the parental core @xmath0(0.5 - 1)@xmath2810@xmath70  yr ago .",
    "this age is consistent with the dynamical age of the outflow , specially if inclination effects are taken into account .",
    "the peculiar sed of iras  22129 + 7000 shows however a _ near and mid  ir excess _ that produces a high t@xmath18 of 175k , consistent with more evolved class  i sources ( @xmath070650k ; myers et al .",
    "1998 ) . given the strong dependence of the short - wavelength ir emission on the viewing angle ( fig.[fig : sed ] )",
    ", the inferred t@xmath18 is certainly affected by orientation effects .",
    "up - to - date 2d sed models show however that inclination is not enough to reproduce the observed _",
    "excess_. nevertheless , as mentioned by robitaille et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , their large grid of modelled seds have some caveats .",
    "the most important for our analysis is that none of them includes multiple central sources .",
    "an interesting possibility is thus that the source in iras  22129 + 7000 is a multiple ( e.g. , binary ) stellar system .",
    "in fact , prestellar cores can fragment a second time during protostellar collapse and lead to the formation of binary systems ( e.g. duchne et al .",
    "2007 ) . however , it is not yet clear if the initial conditions in these cores ( e.g. , the cloud environment ) play a major role in such dynamical fragmentation .",
    "simulations predict that external compression waves arriving at the central object at different times or instabilities in the outer accretion disk could be the seed of multiple protostellar systems ( e.g. , hennebelle et al .",
    "2003 , 2004 ) . in this picture",
    ", the presence of both a young and a more evolved yso sharing a common circumstellar envelope would explain the observed _ near and mid  ir excess _ if the scattered light from the evolved yso escapes from the outflow cavities .",
    "higher angular resolution ir observations are required to confirm this scenario .",
    "in addition , a larger set of molecular line observations and maps are needed to tightly constrain the physics ( infall and rotation velocity fields ) and chemistry ( molecular content ) of this protostar and its environment .",
    "iras  22129 + 7000 is located near ced  201 pdr ( @xmath117@xmath00.4pc and a@xmath40@xmath01 ) . taking into account geometrical dilution and selective dust extinction of fuv dissociating radiation from bd+69@xmath201231 , casey ( 1991 ) computed that a region with a radius of at least @xmath00.6pc ( @xmath0300@xmath25 ) around the exciting star is permeated by fuv photons .",
    "in particular the fuv radiation field near iras  22129 + 7000 should be presently at least @xmath02 times the mean interstellar radiation field . aside from dynamical effects associated with the presence of a nearby pdr illuminated by a runaway star ( e.g. , shock waves ) ,",
    "heating and radiation pressure in the region are larger than in other fuv radiation  free environments .",
    "interestingly enough , the 1.2 mm dust emission ( very weak in the pdr itself ) peaks again in two dust condensations @xmath00.25pc north of ced  201 , roughly in the same direction of outflow red  lobe axis . these cores / clumps have a radius of @xmath05,000au and coincide with an enhancement of the hco@xmath6 @xmath8=10 line emission ( see fig.[fig : mambo ] ) .",
    "it is very likely that these condensations are being externally heated and compressed by the combined action of the outflow and the pdr associated fuv  driven shock wave .",
    "in fact , a similar scenario has presumably led to the formation of iras  22129 + 7000 itself .",
    "we thus suspect that star formation in the b175 globule is triggered by the shocks and radiative feedback induced by bd+69@xmath201231 star and the new generation of low - mass ysos .",
    "observations of cores and ysos provide new insights into how the star formation process is affected by its cloud environment .",
    "the vicinity of late type b stars has interesting intermediate properties between isolated dark cores ( where fuv - radiation does not play a major role ) and cores compressed by the expansion of hii regions ( near more massive stars ) .",
    "cool pdrs such as ced  201 are nearly devoid of ionizing photons and thus they provide a very different environment compared to other star forming regions which are photoionized by brighter ob stars . in the special case of ced  201",
    ", the exciting star is moving fast through the region , suggesting that its arrival to the cloud , and thus the triggering , is recent .",
