    "( b ) qdm internal dynamics in absence of optical perturbations , shows decay of rabi oscillations of @xmath150 and @xmath146 ( red line , blue line ) in the qubit rotation regime at @xmath51kv / cm .",
    "inset shows rabi flops in the early stage of the dynamics ]    figure 5a shows the population time dependence of the input state @xmath153 after switching off the excitation power , @xmath154 , at a time @xmath155ps , as in fig .",
    "4c ( from the numerical solution of eq .",
    "4 , with up to 14 exciton states included ) .",
    "we see that the population relaxes into the vacuum ( see inset ) with a lifetime @xmath156ns .",
    "comparatively the dashed line indicates depopulation of the state when the biexcitonic degrees of freedom ( and all 14 exciton basis states ) are taken into account ( notice they have no influence on the relaxation time when @xmath157 ) .",
    "figure 5b shows the population time dependence of the qdm , when the input state has been driven adiabatically into the rotation regime . here",
    "the system is driven solely by its internal dynamics , which arises due to strong electron and hole tunneling , and the small influence of fret .",
    "both indirect excitons ( blue and red solid lines ) enter a coherent oscillation regime , relaxing into the vacuum with a lifetime @xmath158ns , with vanishing population transfer into the direct excitons .",
    "notice that the relevant coherent oscillation period ( @xmath159ps ) , is orders of magnitude shorter than the relaxation time . on the other hand , our results indicate that despite assuming infinite lifetime for the bare indirect excitons at very large bias , @xmath160kv / cm , the interdot couplings provide a strong dissipation channel for indirect excitons to relax into the vacuum at any finite value of @xmath2 .",
    "in fact , experimental results have shown electric field tuning of radiative lifetimes at the direct - indirect molecular exciton resonance ( near the tunneling induced anticrossing , @xmath161kv / cm ) , still in the range of @xmath162ns to @xmath163ns , if acoustic phonon mediated inter - level relaxation processes are present.@xcite    calculation of the population damping of the state @xmath150 inside the effective subspace @xmath164 , as well as the damping of coherent oscillations within the qubit subspace @xmath104 , gives the effective lifetime of the qubit input state during initialization and the decoherence time during qubit rotation , respectively .",
    "although we consider just the effects of intrinsic spontaneous recombination of the direct excitons , the effective decay rates of the molecular states can be significatively different , since they depend strongly on all interdot coupling mechanisms , and thus can be tuned at will as function of laser detuning , pump power and applied electric field .    in what follows we are interested in the dissipative dynamics of the indirect excitonic subspace .",
    "since @xmath165 , we can ignore the effects of fret in the following discussion . in order to obtain an analytical expression for the effective decay rates , we start with the non - hermitian hamiltonian@xcite @xmath166 and project it onto the subspaces @xmath81 and @xmath104 .",
    "consequently the resultant effective hamiltonian , @xmath167 , will be non - hermitian , with matrix elements that depend on the direct exciton decay , @xmath168 .",
    "projection onto the subspace @xmath104 , results in @xmath169 which must of course reduce to eq .",
    "( [ ham4 ] ) for @xmath170 .",
    "the diagonal part of the non - hermitian projected hamiltonian is , @xmath171 with a projected real perturbation given by @xmath172 and its corresponding imaginary perturbation given by @xmath173 with matrix elements given by , @xmath174    ( color online ) relaxation times for bare and dressed indirect excitons as function of applied electric field @xmath2 .",
    "light red ( blue ) line corresponds to relaxation time for the dressed ( bare ) indirect exciton eigenstates .",
    "far from anticrossing value of electric field @xmath175kv / cm , the dressed relaxation time approaches the bare exciton relaxation time as molecular indirect eigenstates of @xmath176 become the indirect states @xmath146 , @xmath150 . ]",
    "the dissipative part of the hamiltonian , @xmath177 , contains two sources of decoherence , a diagonal source proportional to @xmath178 and an off - diagonal source proportional to @xmath179 .",
    "@xmath178 is the intrinsic population relaxation rate of the dressed indirect excitons , which is non - vanishing when either the electron or the hole tunneling is non - zero .",
    "this term is the dominant part of the relaxation rate , and is present along the whole electric field sweep , inside and outside the qubit subspace .",
    "@xmath179 arises from the simultaneous tunneling of an electron and a hole , and can be interpreted as an interference term between the simultaneous paths of these two charges .",
    "this term is much smaller ( as @xmath180 ) , and contributes mostly inside the qubit subspace .",
    "therefore , the damping of coherent oscillations during the rotation operation , contains population decay and dephasing .",
    "the decay rates of the dressed states inside the qubit subspace , @xmath181 , can be obtained by diagonalization of the hamiltonian ( [ hpinonh ] ) , which gives the total imaginary component of the indirect dressed excitons .",
    "this total rate can be written as @xmath182 im[diag@xmath183@xmath184 @xmath185 , for either indirect exciton @xmath37 , where    @xmath186    @xmath187    @xmath188    figure 6 shows the dependence of the effective relaxation times , @xmath189 ( blue line ) and @xmath190 ( light red line ) , as function of applied electric field @xmath2 . for values of field away from the central anticrossing in fig .",
    "3c , the effective relaxation time , of the eigenstates of @xmath167 , @xmath190 , approaches the relaxation time of the bare effective indirect excitons , @xmath189 , where the interference term ( dephasing ) , @xmath191 , significatively diminishes . at the avoided crossing with @xmath51kv / cm , the eigenstate relaxation time reaches a minimum value of @xmath192 ns .",
    "notice , it is @xmath193 which is more physically relevant , as it gives the lifetime of the qubit logical states for all values of @xmath2 , between the initialization regime , at @xmath194kv / cm , and the rotation regime at @xmath195kv / cm , with corresponding values of @xmath196ns and @xmath197ns , in good agreement with the numerical solutions of the lindblad equation shown on fig .  4 .",
    "notice that the ratio between gate rotation and decoherence times , @xmath198 , is monotonically dependent on the interdot distance , so that an optimal ratio is not given within the model , but is set by the qdm geometry .",
    "in summary , we have shown that the exciton spectrum of a qdm can be used to define an optimally defined qubit using two spatially indirect neutral excitons .",
    "we found that the interplay of optical excitation and charge tunneling can produce optical signatures that identify the indirect exciton qubit subspace .",
    "although the qdm is treated explicitly as an open quantum system , with exciton relaxation rates arising from spontaneous decay , the subspace of indirect qubit states has large decoherence times .",
    "this is explained by a large suppression of the interaction between the qubit subspace and the laser field . on the other hand",
    ", the qubit can be initialized with near unity fidelity via higher order couplings to the radiation field . in this manner",
    "the input state can be shelved for time intervals well beyond the direct exciton relaxation time .",
    "the use of an adiabatic bias pulse permits driving the input state into different molecular resonances , in particular , into a resonance that mixes coherently the input state with a target state of the qubit .",
    "interestingly , a reverse bias pulse drives an adiabatic passage of the output logical state through a tunneling induced anticrossing , transferring half of its population to a spatially direct exciton .",
    "this enables the possibility of directly reading the output of the qubit rotation . the suppression and tunability of the exciton interactions with states outside the qubit subspace contrast drastically with qubits defined via excitons with spatially direct character",
    "this opens the possibility of using neutral exciton states as elemental blocks within a complex qdm quantum computation scheme that uses indirect excitons , such as spin qubits in molecular trions .",
