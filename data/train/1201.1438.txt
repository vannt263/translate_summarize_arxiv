    "dilute quantum gases are ideal for studying many - body physics , because they provide model systems in which the parameters can be precisely controlled .",
    "external fields can be used to tune the effective isotropic contact interactions between the particles , and the geometry and strength of the confining optical potentials can be controlled by laser beams .",
    "for example , quantum - gas analogues of superconductivity @xcite and the superfluid - to - mott - insulator quantum phase transition @xcite have been observed in the laboratory , and their properties have been shown to agree beautifully with the predictions from theoretical models @xcite .",
    "recently , quantum gases of particles with long - range anisotropic interactions have been created @xcite . for particles with permanent electric dipole moments",
    ", the range of the dipole - dipole interactions can be much larger than typical optical lattice spacings , and interesting new quantum phases and quantum information applications have been proposed @xcite .",
    "a quantum gas of @xmath5k@xmath0rb ground - state molecules is the only such system that presently exists in the laboratory @xcite .",
    "our goal is to generate a dipolar quantum gas of ground - state @xmath0rb@xmath1cs , which , unlike krb , is expected to be collisionally stable because both the exchange reaction 2rbcs @xmath6 rb@xmath7 + cs@xmath7 and trimer formation reactions are endothermic @xcite .",
    "although other approaches are under development @xcite , the only method currently available to produce high phase - space density gases of ground - state molecules is to create weakly bound molecules from ultracold atomic gases by magnetic tuning across a feshbach resonance @xcite , and then to transfer the molecules to the rovibronic ground state by stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) @xcite . as a first step ,",
    "we have performed evaporative cooling on rb and cs samples in separate optical traps , combining them at the end to obtain an rb - cs mixture with high phase - space density @xcite .",
    "we have successfully used this mixture to produce ultracold samples of weakly bound rbcs @xcite . in this paper , we present a combined experimental and theoretical study of the interspecies feshbach resonances and weakly bound molecular energy levels of rb - cs and use the results to develop an accurate coupled - channel model of the interaction , based on the derived interaction potentials for the molecular states @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the work described in this paper involved a close collaboration between experiment and theory . at the start of the work ,",
    "the feshbach resonances and bound states observed experimentally @xcite were unassigned . in initial theoretical work , we developed preliminary coupled - channel models of the bound states and scattering and used these to propose assignments of quantum numbers to observed energy levels and feshbach resonances .",
    "experiments were then carried out to test the assignments and extend the early measurements .",
    "the whole process was repeated several times .",
    "however , to aid understanding , we will describe the experiments in section iii below using quantum numbers based on our final understanding from theory ( section iv ) , even though the quantum numbers were not known at the outset .",
    "two alkali - metal atoms in @xmath10 states interact at short range to form singlet ( @xmath8 ) and triplet ( @xmath11 ) states .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have carried out an extensive spectroscopic study of these states by fourier transform spectroscopy and have developed potential energy curves as shown in fig.[fig - curves ] .",
    "they were able to observe the vibrational ladder up to high - lying levels with outer turning points around 1.5 nm , at which point the coupling between singlet and triplet molecular states is already significant .",
    "they also identified in the observed spectra accidental coincidences of singlet and triplet levels deeper within the potential wells , which fixed their relative energy position very well . in the present work",
    ", we initially constrained the short - range part of the potential to follow these curves and adjusted the long - range parameters to reproduce the feshbach resonances and weakly bound states .",
    "the bound states ( feshbach molecules ) that are of most interest in the present paper have binding energies of at most a few mhz@xmath4 and require a quite different description . for a heteronuclear bialkali molecule ,",
    "there are 4 field - free atomic thresholds , which for @xmath0rb@xmath1cs may be labelled in increasing order of energy by @xmath12 = ( 1,3 ) , ( 2,3 ) , ( 1,4 ) , and ( 2,4 ) , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig - curves ] . in a magnetic field , each threshold splits into @xmath13 sublevels labelled @xmath14 .",
    "the feshbach molecules might be described using two different sets of quantum numbers , either @xmath15 or @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the resultant of @xmath18 and @xmath19 and @xmath20 . in the non - rotating case @xmath17 and @xmath21",
    "are exact quantum numbers if there is no external field , but if there is an external magnetic field , it mixes states with different @xmath17 values , destroying the exactness of @xmath17 as a quantum number ; the character of the feshbach molecules at the magnetic fields considered here is more accurately described by @xmath22 . for high magnetic fields , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are also no longer good quantum numbers .     thresholds for @xmath0rb@xmath1cs and the  bins \" ( vertical boxes ) below each threshold within which each vibrational state must lie for any value of the scattering length .",
    "the horizontal boxes , 1.5 ghz deep , show the energy range within which bound levels can cause resonances at the @xmath23 and @xmath24 thresholds at fields under 500  g. the vibrational `` bin '' for each hyperfine state that contains bound states that can cause resonances at the lowest threshold is colored .",
    "selected levels are shown ( short horizontal lines ) as a function of @xmath25 ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 for @xmath29 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) for the specific choice of scattering length that gives a least - bound state for @xmath29 with 110(20 ) khz below threshold . for fields below 500 g , only levels @xmath30 and @xmath31 can cause resonances at the @xmath23 threshold and only levels @xmath32 and @xmath33 can cause resonances at the @xmath24 threshold .",
    "]    additional quantum numbers are needed for the molecules end - over - end angular momentum @xmath25 and the molecular vibration . for near - dissociation levels",
    "it is convenient to specify the vibrational quantum number with respect to the asymptote of the atom pair , so that the topmost level is @xmath34 , the next is @xmath35 , and so on .",
    "each level lies within a  bin \" below its associated dissociation threshold , with the boundaries of the bins determined by the long - range forces between the atoms . for rbcs , using the published values of the long - range dispersion coefficients , @xcite , which are the same for the singlet and triplet potentials , we find that the @xmath34 level lies between zero and @xmath36 mhz , and the @xmath35 level lies between @xmath36 and @xmath37 mhz .",
    "subsequent lower bin boundaries lie at 3.7 , 8.6 , 16.7 and 28.8 ghz below threshold for @xmath38 to @xmath39 , respectively . as shown below , the actual levels for @xmath0rbcs lie close to the top of their bins .",
    "feshbach resonances occur at fields where a bound state exists at the same energy as the colliding atoms .",
    "zero - energy feshbach resonances are caused by molecular levels that cross atomic thresholds as a function of magnetic field .",
    "since the level shifts due to the zeeman effect at fields below 500  g are not more than 1.5 ghz , there is only one vibrational level below each field - free threshold that can cause feshbach resonances at the @xmath23 threshold , as shown in fig.[thresholds_and_bins ] ; these are @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath39 for levels associated with @xmath42 , ( 1,4 ) and ( 2,4 ) , respectively .",
    "in addition to this , levels very close to dissociation ( @xmath34 or @xmath43 ) corresponding to the _ same _ zero - field threshold as the incoming wave can also cause low - field resonances . fig.[thresholds_and_bins ] also shows the situation at the @xmath44 threshold , which will be considered in section [ sec : excited ] .    in the general case we label weakly bound states with a complete set of quantum numbers @xmath45 , with @xmath46 , etc .  designated by @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath26 , etc",
    "@xmath47 is the sum of all angular momenta projected onto the field axis , @xmath48 , and is the only exactly conserved quantum number in an external field .",
    "since , however , @xmath47 is always 4 for the levels studied in this paper ( except in sections [ sec : p - wave ] and [ sec : excited ] ) , we will omit it in the following discussion .",
    "all other angular momenta are approximate quantum numbers , but are sufficient for proper labeling .",
    "we characterize by @xmath49 the partial wave character of the continuum scattering process and speak of incoming @xmath2- and @xmath3-wave resonances for @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "magnetic feshbach resonances are an important tool for the production of weakly bound molecules and for tuning the scattering length , which determines the elastic and inelastic scattering properties of cold atomic gases @xcite .",
    "in addition , their positions provide important clues to the molecular bound state structure that lies below the scattering threshold . in previous work",
    "@xcite we observed 23 resonances over the range 0 to 300 g , using a mixture of the lowest spin states , @xmath0rb@xmath52 and @xmath1cs@xmath53 .",
    "since this mixture was prepared by evaporating both species simultaneously in the same optical trap , interspecies three - body recombination loss and heating @xcite limited the evaporative cooling efficiency , resulting in comparatively high temperatures of 7  @xmath54k and low particle densities of about @xmath55 @xmath56 for each species .    in the current experiment ,",
    "the mixture is created by combining separately cooled atomic clouds @xcite , so it is much colder ( 100 to 200 nk ) and denser ( @xmath57 @xmath56 ) and gives a much better signal - to - noise ratio for the loss features discussed below .",
    "we stop the evaporation procedure before the onset of condensation , because we have previously found the two bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) to be immiscible @xcite .",
    "we hold the mixture at constant magnetic field @xmath58 for 200 ms .",
    "enhanced losses that occur simultaneously for rb and cs are attributed to three - body recombination @xcite at an interspecies feshbach resonance .",
    "we associate the field value @xmath58 at which maximum atom loss occurs with the pole of the resonance .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ feshbachraw ] shows the atom loss in the vicinity of the resonance near @xmath59 g.    for sufficiently wide resonances , we find that the number of rb atoms exhibits a maximum at fields just above resonance .",
    "rb has a lower trap depth than cs and thus bears most of the heat load through evaporation when the two species are in thermal equilibrium @xcite .",
    "reduced thermalization with cs at zero interspecies scattering length reduces the heat load on the rb part of the sample and thus leads to less loss of rb atoms .",
    "this simple explanation allows us to provide an estimate for the resonance width @xmath60 : it is the difference between the field values for the minima ( for rb and cs ) and the maximum ( for rb ) as indicated in fig .",

    "the maximum for the number of rb atoms to the right of the resonance is attributed to the zero crossing for the interspecies scattering length .",
    "the difference in the positions of the minima and the maximum as indicated gives an estimate for the resonance width @xmath60.,width=325 ]    as part of this work , we have scanned over a wider range ( 0 to 667  g ) than in ref .",
    "@xcite , finding 7 new incoming @xmath2-wave resonances in addition to those reported in ref .",
    "the old and new resonances are collected together in table [ resonances ] .",
    "the resonances observed for temperatures @xmath62 nk are assigned as incoming @xmath2-wave ( @xmath63 ) resonances , while those observed at 7  @xmath54k and not observed at 200 nk are assigned as incoming @xmath3-wave ( @xmath64 ) resonances .",
    "the magnetic field is calibrated near each resonance using rb microwave transitions .",
    "the calibration in our previous work @xcite was based on low - field data and was found to deviate from the current calibration by as much as 0.5 g when extrapolated to 300 g. the positions of the incoming @xmath3-wave resonances have therefore been scaled to the new calibration , using the incoming @xmath2-wave resonances observed in both experiments as a reference .",

    "+ cs@xmath53 feshbach resonances observed over the range 0667  g for @xmath2-wave scattering and 0300  g for @xmath3-wave scattering .",
    "the magnetic field uncertainties result from a quadrature of resonance position uncertainty due to atom number noise , and an estimated field calibration error of 0.03  g. resonances too narrow to allow a clear width measurement have no width indicated .",
    "[ resonances ] [ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     @xmath66 this parameter is set to give continuity between the short - range and mid - range functional forms .",
    "at the conclusion of the two - part least - squares refinement procedure described above , we arrived at the potentials given in tables [ fitparms ] , [ singlet ] and [ triplet ] .",
    "table [ fitparms ] gives the parameters from fitting to the feshbach bound states and resonance positions , whereas tables [ singlet ] and [ triplet ] give the full potentials for the singlet and triplet states , respectively .",
    "although the feshbach bound states and resonance positions do allow all 5 parameters in table [ fitparms ] to be extracted , they are very highly correlated .",
    "the table therefore gives both 95% confidence limits and parameter sensitivities as defined by le  roy @xcite .",
    "the 95% confidence limits are correlated properties that describe the uncertainty in an individual parameter , but the parameters need to be specified to within their sensitivities , not their confidence limits , in order to reproduce the results of the calculations .    the new version of the electronic potentials for the rbcs ground - state system reproduces the fourier transform spectra as accurately as the original version of ref .",
    "@xcite , with the important improvement that it can also accurately reproduce properties relating to the very top of the electronic potentials , such as feshbach spectra . there are some remaining deviations between the observed and calculated positions of the @xmath35 states as shown in the lower panels of figure [ wiggle ] , but in view of the possible systematic errors in the corresponding measurements described in sections [ sec:13d03 ] and [ sec : magmom ] above , these are not a great cause for concern .",
    "the final results for the resonance positions and weakly bound states are listed in table [ quality - of - fit ] , together with the quality of fit to the experimental data and the quantum label assignments .",
