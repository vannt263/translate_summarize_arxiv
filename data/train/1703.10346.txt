    "<S> thermodynamic bulk measurements of binding reactions rely on the validity of the law of mass action and the assumption of a dilute solution . yet important biological systems such as allosteric ligand - receptor binding , macromolecular crowding , or misfolded molecules may not follow these assumptions and require a particular reaction model . here </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a fluctuation theorem for ligand binding and an experimental approach using single - molecule force - spectroscopy to determine binding energies , selectivity and allostery of nucleic acids and peptides in a model - independent fashion . </S>",
    "<S> a similar approach could be used for proteins . </S>",
    "<S> this work extends the use of fluctuation theorems beyond unimolecular folding reactions , bridging the thermodynamics of small systems and the basic laws of chemical equilibrium .    </S>",
    "<S> binding energies are key quantities determining the fate of intermolecular reactions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> bulk experimental approaches such as surface plasmon resonance , isothermal titration calorimetry and fluorescent ligand binding assays , allow the extraction of binding energies ( @xmath0 ) from measurements of the dissociation constant ( @xmath1 ) with accuracy @xmath21 kcal / mol through the expression : @xmath3~ , \\label{eq : masact}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath5 the temperature  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , many ligands such as dna - binding proteins display different binding modes with varying affinities , or require the concerted action of several subunits , making quantitative measurements challenging  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> force techniques such as optical tweezers can be used to pull on individual ligand - dna complexes allowing detection of binding events one - at - a - time ( figure  1*a * , inset )  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . however , force - induced ligand unbinding usually takes place in non - equilibrium conditions , and binding energies can not be directly inferred from the measured work values . </S>",
    "<S> the crooks fluctuation theorem and the jarzynski equality  @xcite are tools to extract equilibrium free energy differences from work distributions obtained far from equilibrium , allowing the measurement of folding free energies of nucleic acids and proteins , both from fully equilibrated  @xcite and kinetic states  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , to date the use of fluctuation theorems remains restricted to unimolecular reactions ( e.g. folding ) .    </S>",
    "<S> here we introduce a fluctuation theorem for ligand binding ( ftlb ) that allows us to directly extract binding energies of bimolecular or higher - order reactions from irreversible work measurements in pulling experiments ( see s1.1 in @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> we first show how cyclic protocols allow an unambiguous classification of experimental pathways in relation to the initial and final state , which is an essential step in the application of these theorems . </S>",
    "<S> we then apply the ftlb to directly verify the validity of the law of mass action for dilute ligand solutions . </S>",
    "<S> next we use the ftlb to accurately measure specific and nonspecific binding energies , as well as allosteric effects due to the cooperative binding of ligand pairs . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show how the ftlb is also applicable to extract binding energies to non - native structures ( e.g. misfolded states , prions , chaperones ) , a measurement inaccesible to most bulk techniques  @xcite .    as a proof of principle we investigated the binding of the restriction endonuclease ecori to a 30-bp dna hairpin that contains its recognition site ( gaattc ) ( see s1.2,s1.3 in @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> restriction endonucleases , which bind their cognate sequences with high affinity , are a paradigm of protein - dna interactions  @xcite . in a typical experiment , </S>",
    "<S> the hairpin is unfolded ( refolded ) by increasing ( decreasing ) the distance ( @xmath6 ) between the optical trap and the micropipette ( figure  1*a * ) . in the absence of ligand , the hairpin folds and unfolds in the force range @xmath7 pn . </S>",
    "<S> the binding of ecori increases the stability of the hairpin leading to higher unfolding forces ( @xmath223 pn ) . during a pulling experiment , ecori binds dna when the hairpin is folded . </S>",
    "<S> however , since there is no net change in molecular extension upon binding / unbinding , the native ( @xmath8 ) and bound ( @xmath9 ) states can not be distinguished at low forces . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , at forces above @xmath7 pn the bound state ( @xmath9 ) can be unambiguously distinguished from the unfolded state ( @xmath10 ) , as the hairpin remains folded when the protein is bound but unfolds when it is unbound ( figure  1*a * , empty , blue and cyan dots respectively ) .      </S>",
    "<S> we performed experiments at different ecori concentrations , and determined @xmath23 from the work value ( @xmath24 ) at which the partial work distributions cross ( @xmath25 ) by taking @xmath26 ( figure  1*d * , s1.5 in @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the term @xmath23 includes all the energetic contributions involved in going from @xmath9 to @xmath10 ( e.g. binding energy , conformational changes , elastic terms , see s1.6 in @xcite ) . by subtracting the elastic contributions and the energy of formation of the hairpin from the measured @xmath23 value , we extract the binding energy at zero force ( @xmath27 ) at different ecori concentrations ( figure  1*e * and tables s1 , s2 ) . as shown in figure  1*e * , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath27 follows the law of mass action ( eq . [ eq : masact ] ) , @xmath28 with @xmath29 @xmath30 , providing a direct test of its validity . </S>",
    "<S> this value is independent on the start / end force of the cyclic protocol and relies on a correct classification of paths ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> s2-s3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also performed titration experiments with varying nacl concentration showing that ecori binding energy has a pronounced salt - dependency with slope @xmath31}=-11\\pm 2 $ ] @xmath30 ( figure  1 * f * and tables s3 , s4 ) , in agreement with previous bulk experiments  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we repeated experiments with hairpins containing non - cognate dna sequences which did not show binding in the same range of ecori concentrations , proving the specificity of the interaction  @xcite .    to further test the validity of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : ft ] , we investigated a model system consisting of a short oligonucleotide of 10 bases that binds a dna hairpin . </S>",
    "<S> the oligonucleotide can bind the substrate by base - pairing complementarity when the hairpin is in the unfolded ( @xmath10 ) state , thereby inhibiting the refolding of the hairpin at low forces . at forces below the critical force range of the hairpin ( @xmath32 pn ) , the oligo - bound state ( @xmath9 ) competes with the formation of the native hairpin ( @xmath8 ) , and states @xmath9 and @xmath8 </S>",
    "<S> can be distinguished due to their different molecular extension ( figure  2*a * ) . to apply eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : ft ] , we considered cyclic protocols that start and end at a force lower than the range @xmath33 ( figure  2*b * ) . from the measured partial work distributions and fractions of paths connecting @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( figure  2*c * ) we extracted the binding energies at zero force ( @xmath27 ) ( figure  2*d * and tables s5 , s6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> measured binding energies again follow the law of mass action with @xmath34 @xmath30 ( figure  2*d * ) . </S>",
    "<S> this agrees with theoretical predictions using the nearest - neighbour model ( @xmath35 @xmath36 )  @xcite and equilibrium experiments performed at the coexistence force of the hairpin , where hopping due to binding / unbinding is observed ( figs . </S>",
    "<S> s4-s6 and table s7 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the inclusion of the ratio @xmath37 ( figure  2*d * , inset ) is essential to recover the correct binding energies . </S>",
    "<S> previous attempts to derive binding energies using unidirectional work measurements and the jarzynski equality did not account for concentration - dependent effects in the chemical potential that are essential in equation  [ eq : ft ]  @xcite .    to prove the general power of the method , we studied echinomycin , a small dna bis - intercalator with selectivity for cg steps  @xcite that binds contiguous acgt sites cooperatively  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we performed experiments with a 12-bp dna hairpin containing a single cg - step ( sp hairpin ) that shows rupture forces in the range @xmath38 pn ( figure  3*a * and fig . </S>",
    "<S> s7 ) . in the presence of echinomycin the histogram of rupture forces </S>",
    "<S> is shifted to higher values and shows a bimodal distribution , indicating two binding modes : a high - affinity binding to the specific cg - site ( high - force peak , @xmath39 pn ) , and a low - affinity binding to other non - specific sites ( low - force peak , @xmath40 pn ) . to confirm this , we pulled a hairpin in which we removed the specific binding site by inverting the cg - motif ( nsp hairpin ) . in the presence of ligand only the low affinity peak is observed ( figure  3*a * ) </S>",
    "<S> .    to extract the binding energy of each mode , we performed cyclic protocols that start at a force high enough to discriminate both binding modes : we used @xmath39 pn ( @xmath41 pn ) for the sp ( nsp ) hairpin in order to extract both the specific and nonspecific binding energy of the ligand . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , we obtained paths connecting states @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and extracted the binding energy of the specific and nonspecific modes ( tables s8-s11 ) . for both binding modes </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath42 follows the law of mass action with @xmath43 @xmath30 and @xmath44 @xmath30 ( figure  3*b * ) , which give affinities of 2 nm and 1.8 @xmath45 m respectively ( eq . [ eq : masact ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this measurement of an affinity in the nm range for the specific binding is compatible with quasi - equilibrium experiments ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> s8 ) and improves previous studies where accurate measurements could not be obtained due to the concurrent action of both modes  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the ftlb allows us to go beyond free - energy measurements of single ligands , and measure allosteric effects between ligands binding at nearby positions  @xcite . for this </S>",
    "<S> , we designed hairpin @xmath46 which contains two acgt sites separated by 2 bp ( figure  3*c * ) . </S>",
    "<S> the simultaneous binding of two ligands can be distinguished from the binding of a single ligand from the force rips observed in the force - distance curve ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> s9 ) . by applying the ftlb we extracted the binding energy per ligand in the single and double bound states , and found that binding is favoured by the presence of a neighbouring ligand . </S>",
    "<S> the ftlb allows us to quantitatively test the distance - dependence of this allosteric effect by performing a differential measurement of binding energies with hairpin @xmath47 , which contains two contiguous sites ( figure  3*c * , tables s12-s14 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the binding energy per ligand we obtain in the double bound state in hairpin @xmath47 is @xmath48 @xmath30 higher than in hairpin @xmath46 , providing a direct experimental measurement of cooperativity effects in ligand pairs as a function of their distance .    single - molecule manipulation is particularly suited to observe the formation of misfolded structures ( e.g. prions , amyloids )  @xcite , but methods to characterize binding to these species are currently lacking . by applying the ftlb it is possible to extract the binding energy to these kinetically stabilized non - native structures . by using a dna hairpin with two binding sites separated by 4bp </S>",
    "<S> , we observe the formation of a misfolded structure consisting of two short ( 4bp ) hairpins in series ( figure 3*d * , hairpin m ) . </S>",
    "<S> such an off - pathway kinetic state is unobservable in the absence of ligand due to its low energy of formation , however it is kinetically stabilized by the binding of the ligand . </S>",
    "<S> we applied eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : ft ] by choosing a starting point of the cyclic protocol where the native - bound and misfolded - bound conformations are distinguishable ( @xmath49 pn ) , and found that the energy of binding to both configurations are equal ( @xmath50 @xmath30 , fig . </S>",
    "<S> s10 and tab . </S>",
    "<S> s15 , s16 ) .    in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we have introduced a fluctuation theorem for ligand binding ( ftlb ) to directly determine binding energies as a function of ligand concentration in single - molecule experiments . using different biomolecular systems of increasing complexity we provide a single - molecule verification of the law of mass action , and show how the ftlb can account for mass exchange between a molecular system and the environment . </S>",
    "<S> we can resolve binding energies to specific and non - specific sites with affinities spanning six orders of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> the ftlb provides a direct experimental measurement of binding energies without assuming any model or reaction scheme , which is particularly useful in cases where the law of mass action does not hold . to show this </S>",
    "<S> , we applied the ftlb in two situations where this may happen : the cooperative binding of multiple ligands to the same substrate and the stabilization of kinetic structures through ligand binding - both measurements inaccessible to bulk methods and relevant to many interactions between proteins and ligands .    </S>",
    "<S> the use of an inherently non - equilibrium method to obtain equilibrium binding energies also grants access to molecular interactions that equilibrate over very long timescales ( e.g. nucleosome assembly ) and that can only be currently measured by indirect techniques such as competition assays  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ftlb relates work measurements to binding energies without making any assumption on reaction kinetics or the ideal solution limit . </S>",
    "<S> therefore it might be also used to test the explicit breakdown of the law of mass action in conditions where it is not applicable , for instance in crowded environments , where ligands exhibit compartmentalized dynamics due to steric hindrance interactions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> lastly , the applicabilty of the ftlb is not restricted to biomolecular reactions , and might be directly applied to other interacting systems that can only be explored through non - equilibrium methods . </S>"
