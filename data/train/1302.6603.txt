    "we have required all models to balance mass flux within @xmath26 for convergence , and typically our models balance mass flux to @xmath27 .",
    "we have also explicitly checked the redox ( i.e. , hydrogen budget ) balance ( see our definition of the redox number , flux , and balance in paper i ) , and required the models to balance redox flux to @xmath26 .",
    "one of the most significant controlling factors that determine the steady - state composition of atmospheres on terrestrial exoplanets is the dry deposition velocities of emitted gases and their major photochemical byproducts . of particular importance in this paper",
    "is the dry deposition velocities of and , which could vary by orders of magnitude ( see table [ atmospara ] for the fiducial values of key dry deposition velocities ) .",
    "the dry deposition velocities depend on the properties of the lower atmosphere and the surface .",
    "for example , in a model of the early cold martian atmosphere , the deposition velocities are assumed to be reduced by an artificial factors of up to 1000 compared with those in warm current earth ( e.g. , tian et al . 2010 ) , in order to account for less efficient deposition at a lower temperature .",
    "for another example , in modeling the early martian atmosphere , because the putative mars ocean is believed to be saturated with dissolved and other sulfur species , deposition is assumed to be balanced by the an equivalent return flux from the ocean ( e.g. halevy et al . 2007 ; tian et al . 2010 ) and",
    "then @xmath28 of is assumed to be zero . in this paper , we explore the effect of varying the dry deposition velocities of and , which can be scaled down by a factor of 100 if the surface is saturated with sulfide or sulfite . another important factor that strongly influences the atmospheric sulfur chemistry is the formation and sedimentation of aerosols .",
    "photochemically produced and may condense to form aerosols if their concentrations exceed their vapor saturation concentrations .",
    "the parameterization of condensation and sedimentation of aerosols in our photochemistry model is described in detail in paper i. saturation vapor pressure of is taken as recommended by seinfeld & pandis ( 2006 ) for atmospheric modeling , with a validity temperature range of 150 - 360 k. is the stable form of elemental sulfur because the molecule has a crown - shape ring structure that puts least strain on the s - s bond among sulfur allotropes and the crown structure allows for considerable cross - ring interaction between nonbonded atoms ( meyer 1976 ) .",
    "the saturation pressure of is then taken as the total sulfur saturation pressure against liquid sulfur at @xmath29 k and solid ( monoclinic ) sulfur at @xmath30 k tabulated by lyons ( 2008 ) .",

    "we provide the physical rationale of specifying temperature - pressure profiles and eddy diffusion coefficients for our atmospheric photochemistry models .",
    "we modeled the atmospheric composition from the 1-bar pressure level up to the altitudes of about 10 scale heights .",
    "we chose appropriate vertical resolution for each scenario so that there are 4 layers per scale height .",
    "we adopted a temperature profile for our atmosphere models , without considering feedback on temperature of the atmospheric composition .",

    "the temperature profiles are then assume to follow appropriate dry adiabatic lapse rate ( i.e. , the convective layer ) until 160 k ( atmosphere ) , 200 k ( atmosphere ) , and 175k ( atmosphere ) and to be constant above ( i.e. , the radiative layer ) .",
    "the adopted temperature profiles are consistent with significant greenhouse effects in the convective layer and no additional heating above the convective layer for habitable exoplanets",

    "while not ideal , these temperature profiles yield the same results discussed in the below as temperature profiles varied by several tens of k. the precise temperature - pressure structure of the atmosphere is less important than photochemistry for the investigation of sulfur chemistry because the most important photolysis and chemical reactions are not significantly affected by minor deviations in the temperature profile .",
    "we found that variation of temperature profiles by a few tens of k has minor impact on the atmospheric composition .",
    "vertical transport of gases in the atmosphere is parameterized by eddy diffusion , and the coefficients are assumed to be those of earth s atmosphere scaled by the atmospheric scale height to account for , , and being the dominant species .",
    "the current earth s eddy diffusion coefficient profile has been derived from mixing ratio profiles of several long - lived gases ( massie & hunten 1981 ; also shown in figure 1 of paper i ) .",
    "we use the empirical eddy diffusion coefficient profile for current earth as a template , and scale the coefficient inversely with the mean molecular mass for , , and dominated atmospheres .",
    "the justification for such scaling is that the eddy diffusion coefficient is proportional to the mixing length which is in turn a portion of the atmospheric scale height ( e.g. , smith 1998 ) .",
    "the pressure surface to pressure surface projection also ensures that the eddy diffusion coefficient profile features a eddy diffusion minimum near the tropopause for atmospheres with different mean molecular masses .",
    "our approach to parameterize vertical transport is of course an approximation .",
    "an accurate representation of vertical transport would likely involve circulation on the global scale ( e.g. , holton 1986 ) .",

    "this secondary source for atomic hydrogen is particularly important when the host star is a quiet m dwarf , because a quiet m dwarf produces few photons that could dissociate water . for planets around",
    "quiet m dwarfs the photolysis of could be the main source of atomic hydrogen in their atmospheres .",
    "additional numerical simulations show that in the habitable zone of a quiet m dwarf having an effective temperature of 3100 k , photolysis alone can produce enough atomic hydrogen to drive the formation of elemental sulfur in the atmosphere .",
    "we here comment on the uncertainty of photochemistry models regarding the yield of . in our model , we have assumed polymerization of elemental sulfur proceeds via we also include photodissociation for , , and . however , the reaction rates of sulfur polymerization ( reactions [ sp0 ] - [ sp4 ] ) have not been well established by laboratory studies , and previous authors have adopted different rate constants for these reactions . in particular , kasting ( 1990 ) and pavlov & kasting ( 2002 ) have used 3-order - of - magnitude lower rates for reactions ( [ sp0 ] - [ sp1 ] ) and 1-order - of - magnitude lower rates for reactions ( [ sp2 ] - [ sp4 ] ) , compared with moses et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . in this work , we have adopted the reaction rates of moses et al .",
    "( 2002 ) for elemental sulfur reactions .",
    "our sensitivity tests show that adopting the reaction rates of kasting ( 1990 ) would result in about 3 to 10 times less .",
    "we have chosen a higher sulfur polymerization rates for nominal models because : ( 1 ) the chemical pathways of reactions ( [ sp0 ] - [ sp4 ] ) are probably not complete and there may be other pathways to form ; ( 2 ) , , and may condense as suggested by lyons ( 2008 ) and the polymerization may still proceed in the condensed phase to .",
    "experimental studies are encouraged to settle this important uncertainty .",
    "and gases emitted from the surface can be converted into both elemental sulfur ( ) and sulfuric acid ( ) in the oxidized ( but anoxic ) atmospheres such as and dominated atmospheres .",
    "the major chemical pathways that lead to formation of both elemental sulfur and sulfuric acid , and the results of photochemistry model simulations are shown in figure [ n2_chem ] .",
    "the production of elemental sulfur aerosols involves uv photons and atomic hydrogen , as does in reducing atmospheres ; whereas the production of sulfuric acid requires oxidizing species , notably and .",
    "these reactive species , either reducing or oxidizing , are produced from photolysis of water and .",
    "in particular , the source of , responsible for converting to sulfuric acid in the atmosphere , is the photodissociation of . as a result",
    ", the amount of uv photons that are capable of dissociating water controls the yield of .",
    "for example in the habitable zone of a quiet m dwarf the yield of is much reduced compared with solar - like stars by at least one order of magnitude .",
    "the photochemically produced and may condense to form aerosols in the atmosphere if saturated . as a result ,",
    "aerosols in the atmospheres provide a uv shield that enables the accumulation of and beneath the layer of aerosols .",
    "in particular for an earth - sized planet in the habitable zone of a sun - like star , when the surface emission rate is more than two - orders - of - magnitude higher than the current earth s volcanic sulfur emission rate , photochemical aerosols in the atmosphere lead to substantial uv shielding for accumulation of and , as shown in figure [ n2_chem ] .",
    "we find that only when sulfur emission is highly elevated with respect to current earth could or accumulate to the order of parts per million mixing ratio in the and atmospheres .",
    "the relative yield between elemental sulfur and sulfuric acid is controlled by the redox power of the atmosphere . in general ,",
    "more sulfuric acid aerosols and less elemental sulfur aerosols are anticipated in a more oxidizing atmosphere .",
    "the redox power of the atmosphere , in turn , is determined by both the main constituent and the reducing gas emission .",
    "dominated atmospheres are mosre oxidizing than dominated atmospheres as photodissociation of leads to atomic oxygen .",
    "therefore the primary sulfur emission is more likely to be converted to sulfuric acid in dominated atmospheres than in dominated atmospheres ( see figure [ n2_chem ] ) .",
    "surface emission of reducing gases , including , , , and , alters the redox budget of the atmosphere and therefore increases the relative yield of elemental sulfur versus sulfuric acid aerosols ( e.g. , zahnle et al 2006 ) .",
    "as shown in figure [ n2_chem ] , when the sulfur emission rate increases , both and atmospheres become more and more reducing ( because is reducing ) , which results in a dramatic increase of elemental sulfur production in the atmosphere .",
    "furthermore , the / ratio in the sulfur emission affects its contribution to the redox power of the atmosphere and then the relative abundances of the two types of aerosols in the atmosphere significantly . as a result of the increase in the / emission ratio , the amount of aerosol in the atmosphere increases , and the amount of in the atmosphere decreases dramatically ( see figure [ n2_ratio ] ) . for an earth - like planet",
    "having an atmosphere , if the / emission ratio is less than 0.1 ( as is the case for current earth ; holland 2002 ) , the dominant type of aerosols in the atmosphere is sulfate ; whereas elemental sulfur aerosols become the dominant type if the / emission ratio is larger than 1 .",
    "the main finding is that on terrestrial exoplanets having atmospheres ranging from reducing to oxidizing , the primary sulfur emission from the surface ( e.g. , and ) is chemically short - lived .",
    "the sulfur emission leads to photochemical formation of elemental sulfur ( ) and sulfuric acid ( ) , which would condense to form aerosols if saturated in the atmosphere . in reducing atmospheres ( e.g. , atmospheres ) ,",
    "aerosols are photochemically formed based on and emission ; and in oxidized atmospheres ( e.g. , and atmospheres ) , both and aerosols may be formed ( see figure [ sulfur_s ] ) . in general , the higher the surface sulfur emission , the more aerosols exist in the atmosphere ( see figure [ sulfur_s ] ) .    as a result of photochemical production of elemental sulfur and sulfuric acid , terrestrial exoplanets with a habitable surface temperature ( e.g. , @xmath46 k ) and substantial sulfur emission from the surface are likely to have hazy atmospheres . in this paper ,",
    "we use  hazy \" to describe an atmosphere that has significant aerosol opacities at visible wavelengths ( e.g. , 500 nm ) .",
    "we find that even with an earth - like surface sulfur emission , 1-bar dominated atmospheres on habitable rocky exoplanets are hazy with aerosols ( see figure [ sulfur_s ] ) .",
    "we also find that if the sulfur emission rate is @xmath47 times more than the earth s current volcanic sulfur emission rate , photochemical aerosols become optically thick at visible wavelengths in oxidized atmospheres including and atmospheres ( see figure [ sulfur_s ] ) .",
    "the key parameters that determine the aerosol opacity in the atmosphere are the surface sulfur emission rate , the dry deposition velocity , and the aerosol particle size .",
    "first , a higher surface sulfur emission rate leads to more sulfur and sulfate aerosols in anoxic atmospheres ( e.g. , figure [ sulfur_s ] and figure [ sulfur_gms ] ) .",
    "second , larger dry deposition velocities of and cause more rapid removal of these sulfur compounds from the atmosphere , which reduces the chance of converting them into condensable molecules ( i.e. , and ) . therefore ,",
    "larger dry deposition velocities of and result in lower aerosol loading and aerosol opacities in the atmospheres , as shown in figure [ sulfur_vb ] .",
    "third , we find that the particle size has only secondary effects on the chemical composition of the atmosphere ( i.e. , by increasing the penetration of ultraviolet radiation ) , but has a primary effect on the aerosol optical depth",
    ". for mean particle diameter varying in the range of @xmath48 @xmath1 m ( i.e. , typical particle sizes of photochemical aerosols on earth ( e.g. , seinfeld & pandis 2006 ) and titan ( e.g. , rages et al .",
    "1983 ) ) , we do not see a notable variation in the yield of elemental sulfur , but we see an enhancement of production with large particles ( figure [ sulfur_gms ] ) . even with the same aerosol abundances , however , micron - sized particles cause lower opacities at the visible wavelengths and higher opacities in mir compared with submicron - sized particles ( figure [ sulfur_gms ] ) .",
    "we capture the effects of the three key parameters on the aerosol opacity in anoxic atmospheres on terrestrial exoplanets by fitting the following power - law formula , i.e. , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the vertical optical depth due to aerosols at 1 bar , @xmath51 is the total sulfur emission rate , @xmath52 is the dry deposition velocities of and with respect to current earth values , @xmath53 is the mean particle diameter of aerosols , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 are positive numbers , and @xmath57 is a constant that covers other uncertainties .",
    "we have fit the empirical relation ( [ eqnsyn ] ) through an extensive parameter exploration using photochemistry models ( see figure [ sulfur_s ] - [ sulfur_vb ] for examples ) and determined the values of @xmath57 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 for dominated reducing atmospheres and for and dominated oxidized atmospheres .",
    "we summarize graphically the parameter regime in which sulfur emission leads to a hazy atmosphere in figure [ syn ] . here",
    "we use @xmath58 and @xmath59 as the representatives for aerosol opacities at visible wavelengths and mir wavelengths ; due to the complex nature of the extinction cross sections of aerosol particles ( figure [ cross_compare ] ) , it is not practical to fold the full wavelength dependency into the empirical formula .",
    "also , we find that it is always true that @xmath60 for mean particle diameter in the order of 10 @xmath1 m and @xmath61 for mean particle diameter in the order of 0.1 @xmath1 m .    for atmospheres , and mean particle diameter @xmath62 in the the range of @xmath48 @xmath1 m , @xmath63 and for @xmath62 in the the range of @xmath64 @xmath1 m , @xmath65    for and atmospheres , and @xmath62 in the the range of 0.1 and 1 @xmath1 m , @xmath66 and for @xmath62 in the the range of @xmath64 @xmath1 m , @xmath67    the constant @xmath57 in equations ( [ h2_syn1 ] - [ n2_syn2 ] ) spans about one order of magnitude , which covers the variation of the following model inputs :    * the / ratio in the surface sulfur emission , ranging from 0.01 to 10 ; * temperature profiles deviating from the adopted temperature profile by @xmath68 k that controls the mixing ratio of water vapor in the atmosphere by the cold trap ; * stellar ultraviolet radiation received by the planet , ranging from the habitable zone of solar - like stars to the habitable zone of quiet m dwarfs with an effective temperature of 3100 k ; * eddy diffusion coefficients ranging from 0.1 to 100 times the values of earth s atmosphere ; * sulfur polymerization reaction rates ( reactions [ sp0 ] - [ sp4 ] ) ranging by one order of magnitude .    to summarize , we find that the emission of and from the surface is readily converted into sulfur ( ) and sulfate ( ) in anoxic atmospheres of terrestrial exoplanets",
    ". the photochemical sulfur and sulfate would condense to form aerosols if saturated in the atmosphere , which is likely to occur on a planet in the habitable zone of either a sun - like star or a quiet m star .",
    "the aerosol layer is optically thick at the visible and nir wavelengths if the surface sulfur emission is comparable to earth s volcanic sulfur emission in the atmosphere , and more than @xmath47 times of the earth s volcanic sulfur emission in other anoxic atmospheres , depending on the dry deposition velocities of sulfur compounds and particle size of the aerosols .",
    "the sulfur emission from surface shapes the spectra of terrestrial exoplanets at the visible and nir wavelengths , mostly through the photochemical formation of and aerosols .",
    "we use the model outputs from the photochemistry models to compute the transmission , reflection , and thermal emission spectra of a terrestrial exoplanet with various levels of sulfur emission , and show examples of the computed spectra in figure [ spec ] .",
    "we see that submicron - sized aerosols dominate the transmission and reflection spectra at wavelengths from visible up to 3 @xmath1 m , if the sulfur emission is more than about two orders of magnitude higher than earth s volcanic sulfur emission . in general ,",
    "an atmosphere with high sulfur emission and therefore high aerosol loading generally exhibits a flat transmission spectrum ( the features at nir muted ) , and a high visible albedo ( see figure [ spec ] ) .",
    "notably , aerosols are purely reflective at 500 nm but absorptive at 300 nm .",
    "the absorption edge of aerosols in 300 - 400 nm is evident in the reflection spectra for planets with enhanced sulfur emission ( figure [ spec ] ) , which is a potential diagnostic feature for aerosols .",
    "although opaque at visible wavelengths , the atmospheres with enhanced sulfur emission are likely to be transparent in the mir wavelengths ( @xmath69 @xmath1 m ) .",
    "the spectral features of aerosols depend on their particle sizes , so we now consider two possibilities : if the particles are submicron - sized , the aerosol molecules have negligible cross sections at mir ( see figure [ cross_compare ] ) ; or if the particles are micron - sized , the falling velocity of aerosol particles is large enough to rapidly remove aerosols from the atmosphere , as implied by equation ( [ h2_syn2 ] ) and equation ( [ n2_syn2 ] ) that are applicable for micron - sized particles .",
    "therefore in both cases the aerosol opacities at mir are minimal even for very high sulfur emission rates ( see figure [ spec ] for examples of atmospheres , and atmospheres are qualitatively similar ) .",
    "the only exception , in which aerosols indeed affect mir spectra , is the case of abundant aerosols .",
    "the main spectral effect of aerosols is absorption at mir wavelengths ( @xmath70 @xmath1 m ; figure [ spec ] ) .",
    "however , the column - average mixing ratio of needs to be larger than 0.1 ppm in order to produce significant aerosol absorption at mir . we find with numerical exploration that such a high abundance of aerosols is only possible in",
    "highly oxidizing dominated atmospheres without reducing gas emission ( see paper i for an example of such atmospheres ) . with reducing gas emission ( i.e. , and ) ,",
    "it is unlikely that mixing ratio exceeds 0.01 ppm in anoxic atmospheres for a wide range of sulfur emission rates ( see figure [ sulfur_s ] ) . in summary",
    "we expect the spectral effects of and aerosols to be minimal at mir for most cases .",
    "we now turn to consider the direct spectral features of and .",
    "it has been previously proposed that and can be detectable on terrestrial exoplanets by their spectral features ( kaltenegger & sasselov 2010 ) .",
    "however , our photochemistry models show that both and are chemically short - lived in the atmospheres , which implies that that substantial surface emission is required to maintain a detectable level of either or in the atmosphere .",
    "has diagnostic absorption features at 7.5 @xmath1 m and 20 @xmath1 m ( see figure [ spec ] ) . for these features",
    "to be detectable the mixing ratio of needs to be larger than 0.1 ppm , which corresponds to sulfur emission rates 1000 times more than current earth s sulfur emission rates for , , and atmospheres ( see figure [ sulfur_s ] ) .",
    "the spectral feature of is the pseudo - continuum absorption at wavelengths longer than 30 @xmath1 m , which coincides with the rotational bands of .",
    "we find that the only scenario in which may be directly detected is the case with extremely high sulfur emission rates ( i.e. , 3000 times higher than the current earth s sulfur emission rate ) on a highly desiccated planet without liquid water ocean so that there is no water vapor contamination .",
    "we therefore conclude that direct detection of and is tricky : they are chemically short - lived so that extremely large surface emission is required for a detectable mixing ratio in the atmosphere , and their spectral features may be contaminated by other gases in the atmosphere .    finally , we suggest that the emission of sulfur compounds might be indirectly inferred by detecting sulfur and sulfate aerosols .",
    "our numerical exploration reveals a monotonic relationship between the abundance of aerosols in the atmosphere and the emission rates of sulfur compounds ( see figure [ sulfur_s ] ) , and the composition of aerosols is correlated with the / ratio of the surface emission ( see figure [ n2_ratio ] ) .",
    "a combination of featureless low atmospheric transmission ( large planet radius viewed in transits ) and high planetary albedo ( large planetary flux at the visible wavelengths viewed in occultations ) may establish the existence of aerosols in the atmosphere . in particular , elemental sulfur ( ) aerosols are absorptive at wavelengths shorter than 400 nm and therefore might be identified by the absorption edge ( see figure [ spec ] ) .",
    "sulfate aerosols ( ) , if abundant in the atmosphere , lead to absorption features at the mir wavelengths ( @xmath71 - 10 @xmath1 m ) . however , none of these features are uniquely diagnostic of certain types of aerosols .",
    "the identification of aerosol composition , therefore , is by no means straightforward .",
    "we learn from the solar system exploration that the discriminating piece of information for aerosol identification comes from polarization of reflected stellar light .",
    "historically , the bright clouds on venus were identified to be mainly composed of droplets after the phase curve of the planet in polarized light had been observed ( e.g. , young 1973 ; hansen & hovenier 1974 ) .",
    "we therefore postulate that aerosol identification on terrestrial exoplanets and the inference of surface sulfur emission might require observation of polarized reflected light as a function of planetary illumination phase .",
    "biosignatures are gases in an exoplanet s atmosphere produced by life . in order to confirm a certain gas to be a plausible biosignature",
    ", one has to verify that the gas can accumulate in the atmosphere and that the amount of gas detected can not be produced through plausible abiotic processes .",
    "it has been proposed and widely discussed that ( and its photolytic product ) , , and are exoplanet biosignatures ( e.g. , sagan et al .",
    "1993 ; des marais et al .",
    "2002 ; segura et al . 2005 ; segura et al . 2007 ; hu et al .",
    "organosulfur compounds , such as dimethyl sulfide ( dms ) and methanethiol ( ) , have also been suggested to be biosignatures of the early earth ( pilcher 2003 ) and anoxic exoplanets ( domagal - goldman et al . 2011 ) .",
    "can be produced from several metabolic origins on earth , and so is a candidate biosignature gas .",
    "life on earth can produce through sulfate reduction ( when the environment is reduced ) and sulfur disproportionation .",
    "microorganisms can disproportionate sulfur compounds of intermediate oxidation states , including thiosulfate , sulfite , and elemental sulfur , into and sulfate ( finster 2008 ) .",
    "for example , disproportionation of sulfite in the ocean is described by in which the gibbs free energy released is 58.9 kj mol@xmath7 sulfite .",
    "the sulfite reducers , including microorganisms in genus _",
    "desulfovibrio _ and _ desulfocapsa _ , extract energy from the disproportionation ( kramer and cypionka , 1989 ) .",
    "the effect of biotic production is the increase of the / ratio of the surface sulfur emission .",
    "if the / ratio in the volcanic sulfur emission is low ( i.e. , less than 0.1 ) , sulfur disproportionation and sulfate reduction by life may increase the / ratio significantly , which may lead to a change in the redox input to the atmosphere and therefore the dominant aerosol species in the atmosphere , as suggested by figure [ n2_ratio ] . specifically , for a habitable terrestrial exoplanet having a weakly oxidizing atmosphere , biotic production of in excess of the geological emission could result in a higher amount of aerosols and a much lower amount of aerosols in the atmosphere compared with a planet without life .",
    "although it is currently not possible to distinguish different types of aerosols , could be a biosignature gas in the long term .",
    "the geological production of , and the consequent risk of a false positive mis - identification of geological for biological , will be a major obstacle of confirming to be a biosignature gas .",
    "sulfur is believed to be present in the mantle of all terrestrial planets , and what determines the / ratio in the volcanic outgassing is the oxygen fugacity of the upper mantle , temperature of the location where magma degassing happens , water content in the conduit of magma , and gas content dissolved in the magma ( e.g. , holland 1984 ; kasting et al .",
    "1985 ; holland 2002 ; burgisser & scaillet 2007 ) . the current earth volcanic emissions are oxidized , dominated by , and with minor contributions of , and . this volcanic gas composition is consistent with a magma buffered by the quartz - fayalite - magnetite ( qfm ) equilibrium , i.e. , a relatively oxidized upper mantle ( holland 1984 ) . as a global average ,",
    "the volcanic / emission ratio on earth is 0.1 ( holland 2002 ) .",
    "however , if the mantle of a rocky exoplanet is much more reducing than that of the current earth , significant geological source of can be expected ( holland 1984 ; kasting 1993 ) . as a result",
    ", it would be very hard to rule out a geological contribution to the emission flux by remote sensing .    in summary , although can be produced by energy - yielding metabolism , it is very unlikely to be a useful biosignature gas for three reasons .",
    "firstly , itself is unlikely to be detectable directly by remote sensing because of its weak spectral features , and their contamination by the spectral features of water .",
    "secondly , has a very short atmospheric lifetime , and so unrealistic emission rates are required to build up significant levels in any atmosphere .",
    "this second point could be overcome , in principle , by detecting aerosols in an anoxic atmosphere , and discriminating them from aerosols .",
    "discrimination between sulfur and sulfuric acid aerosols is not possible with current equipment , but may be possible in the future through analysis of reflected light .",
    "thirdly , however , suffers from a significant false positive risk , as geological sources can also produce , and the ratio of / in geological emissions depends on mantle chemistry , the physical structure of the outgassing events , and the extent of surface reprocessing of vented sulfur gases . to infer that life was generating on a planet",
    ", this study shows that the observer would have to determine the / aerosol ratio and have knowledge of the geological outgassing ratio of / and have knowledge of the surface chemistry that might modulate the primary outgassing rate .",
    "this seems an unreasonable requirement .",
    "we studied the effect of and surface emission on anoxic atmospheres of terrestrial exoplanets . with a newly established one - dimensional photochemistry model that treats all relevant chemical reactions and photochemical processes of o , h , c , and s bearing species , as well as formation and sedimentation of sulfur and sulfate aerosols",
    ", we find that and gases emitted from surface are chemically short - lived in both reducing and oxidizing atmospheres .",
    "the sulfur emission results in photochemical production of elemental sulfur ( ) and sulfuric acid ( ) , which would condense to form aerosols if they are saturated in the atmosphere . for a planet in the habitable zone of a sun - like star or a m star",
    ", earth - like sulfur emission rates would result in optically thick aerosol layers in -dominated atmospheres ; and a sulfur emission rate 2-orders - of - magnitude higher than the earth s volcanic sulfur emission rate would result in optically thick aerosol layers in and -dominated atmospheres .",
    "the composition of the photochemically produced aerosols mostly depends on the redox state of the atmosphere : aerosols are formed in the reducing atmospheres ( e.g. , atmospheres ) , and both and aerosols are formed in the oxidized atmospheres that could be both reducing and oxidizing ( e.g. , and atmospheres ) .",
    "based on extensive numerical simulations , we provide empirical formulae that show the dependency of the aerosol optical depth on the surface sulfur emission rates , the dry deposition velocities of sulfur compounds , and the aerosol particle sizes .",
    "we find that direct detection of and is unlikely due to the rapid photochemical conversion from and to elemental sulfur and sulfuric acid in atmospheres having a wide range of redox powers .",
    "for a terrestrial exoplanet with sulfur emitted from the surface at an enhanced rate , it is likely that at visible wavelengths the planet s atmosphere appears to be opaque due to the aerosol loading and that the planet has high visible albedo .",
    "however , for earth - like planets with 1-bar atmospheres ranging from reducing to oxidizing , we find the effect of photochemical sulfur and/or sulfate aerosols in the mir wavelengths is minimal , because micron - sized particles that interact with mir photons have large gravitational settling velocities and therefore short atmospheric lifetime . finally , as the aerosol composition is tightly related to the ratio of the versus emission , although direct detection of and by their spectral features is unlikely , their existence might be inferred by observing aerosol - related features in reflected light with future generation space telescopes .",
