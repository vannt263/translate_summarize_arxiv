    "one of the important feature of diffractive electroproduction of vector mesons ^*pvp ,  v=^0,^0 , ^0,j/ , ...",
    "[ eq:1.1 ] at high energy , @xmath7 , is a possibility to study the pomeron exchange @xcite .",
    "the high energy hadrons and photons are considered as color dipoles in the mixed @xmath8 lightcone representation @xcite with the transverse size , @xmath9 , frozen during the interaction process .",
    "the interaction ( scattering ) process is characterized by the color dipole cross section , @xmath10 , which represents the interaction of color dipoles with the target nucleon .",
    "the energy evolution of the color dipole cross section is described by the generalized bfkl ( gbfkl ) equation @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6 vector meson production amplitude probes the color dipole cross section at the dipole size , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the scanning radius .",
    "this property is the so - called _ scanning phenomenon _ @xcite and reflects the shrinkage of the transverse size of the virtual photon with @xmath13 together with the small - size behaviour of the dipole cross section ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the scanning radius can be expressed through the scale parameter , @xmath15 , as r_s .",
    "[ eq:1.2 ] at large @xmath13 and/or for heavy vector mesons , the scanning radius is small and the production amplitude of reaction ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) is perturbatively calculable .",
    "however , due to a large scale parameter , @xmath16 , in ( [ eq:1.2 ] ) @xcite , the onset of the short - distance dominance is very slow for the production of light vector mesons even at the moderate @xmath17gev@xmath18 corresponding to the present fixed target and hera experiments .",
    "therefore , changing @xmath13 and the mass of vector mesons , one can study the transition between the perturbative ( hard ) and nonperturbative ( soft ) regimes .",
    "one of the interesting consequence of the color dipole gbfkl dynamics is a steeper energy dependence of the dipole cross section at smaller dipole size @xcite which can be studied also using the scanning phenomenon .",
    "diffractive production of the @xmath3 radially excited vector mesons ^*pvp ,",
    "v(2s)=, , ,, ... [ eq:1.3 ] is particularly interesting because of the node effect : a strong cancellation of dipole size contributions to the production amplitude coming from the region above and below the node position , @xmath19 , in the @xmath3 radial wave function @xcite .",
    "one of the important consequence of the node effect is a strong suppression of the photoproduction of radially excited vector mesons @xmath5 vs. @xmath6 mesons @xcite .",
    "the nmc experiment @xcite and recently the e687 experiment @xcite confirmed this suppression for the ratio @xmath20 .",
    "there are two main reasons which affect the cancellation pattern in the @xmath5 production amplitude .",
    "the first is connected with the @xmath13 behaviour of the scanning radius @xmath12 ( [ eq:1.2 ] ) ; for the electroproduction of @xmath5 light vector mesons at moderate @xmath13 when the scanning radius @xmath12 is comparable to @xmath19 , even a slight variation of @xmath12 with @xmath13 strongly changes the cancellation pattern and leads to an anomalous @xmath13 dependence @xcite .",
    "the second reason is due to the different dipole - size dependence of the color dipole cross section at different energies in accordance with the gbfkl dynamics leading also to an anomalous energy dependence for the @xmath5 vector meson production .    in the photoproduction limit of very small @xmath13 , there are two possibilities occurring in the @xmath5 production amplitude",
    ". the relative sign of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 production amplitudes can be opposite ( the overcompensation scenario of ref .",
    "the second case corresponds to the same sign of both amplitudes ( the undercompensation scenario of ref .",
    "the relative sign of the @xmath21 and @xmath22 production amplitudes is experimentally measurable using the so - called sding effect @xcite .",
    "here we present a short review of the color dipole phenomenology of diffractive electroproduction of vector mesons developed in @xcite .",
    "a meson as a color dipole is described by the distribution of the transverse separation , @xmath9 , of the quark and antiquark given by the @xmath23 wave function , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the fraction of the meson lightcone momentum carried by a quark .",
    "the interaction of the relativistic color dipole moment , @xmath9 , with the target nucleon is quantified by the energy dependent color dipole cross section , @xmath10 .",
    "the fock state expansion for the relativistic meson starts with the @xmath23 state and the higher fock states @xmath26 become very important at high energy . in the leading - log @xmath27 approximation",
    ", the effect of higher fock states can be reabsorbed into the energy dependence of @xmath10 , which satisfies the generalized bfkl equation @xcite .",
    "the dipole cross section is flavour independent and represents the universal function of @xmath28 which describes various diffractive processes in unified form . within this color dipole formalism ,",
    "the imaginary part of the production amplitude for the virtual photoproduction of vector mesons in the forward direction ( @xmath29 ) reads = v|(,r)|^*=_0 ^ 1 dz d^2*r*(,r ) _",
    "v^*(*r*,z ) _",
    "^*(*r*,z ) [ eq:2.2 ] whose normalization is @xmath30 @xmath31 and @xmath32 represent the probability amplitudes to find the color dipole of size @xmath28 in the photon and quarkonium ( vector meson ) , respectively .",
    "the color dipole distribution in ( virtual ) photons was derived in @xcite .",
    "( [ eq:2.2 ] ) represents the color dipole factorization formula because of the diagonalization of the scattering matrix in the @xmath8 representation .",
    "the energy dependence of the dipole cross section is quantified by the dimensionless rapidity , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 is a mass of the vector meson . at large energies corresponding to the hera energy region , the regge parameter is large , @xmath36 , and pomeron exchange dominates .    the more explicit form of the forward production amplitudes for the transversely ( t ) and the longitudinally ( l ) polarized vector mesons reads @xcite _ t(x_eff , q^2)= n_cc_v ( 2)^2   + d^2*r * ( x_eff , r ) _ 0 ^ 1dz z(1-z)\\ { m_q^2 k_0(r ) ( r , z)- [ z^2+(1-z)^2]k_1(r)_r ( r , z ) } + = 1 ( m_v^2+q^2)^2 w_t(q^2,r^2 ) [ eq:2.4 ] _",

    "( [ eq:2.4]),([eq:2.5 ] ) using the following substitution @xcite ( x_eff , r ) ( 1-i ) ( x_eff , r ) .",
    "[ eq:2.7 ] for small @xmath28 , in the leading - log @xmath27 the dipole cross section can be related to the gluon structure function , @xmath44 , of the target nucleon through ( x , r ) = r^2_s(r)g(x , q^2 ) , [ eq:2.8 ] where the gluon structure function enters at the scale @xmath45 @xcite with @xmath46 @xcite .",

    "the amplitudes ( [ eq:2.4]),([eq:2.5 ] ) are dominated by the dipole size , @xmath49 ( scanning phenomenon ) .",

    "our predictions for high energy agree well with the recent zeus data @xcite .",
    "we find also good agreement with the fixed target @xcite and zeus @xcite data on real @xmath62 photoproduction .    a smaller scanning radius for @xmath62 photoproduction vs. @xmath50 photoproduction results in a steeper energy dependence of the former ( see fig.2 ) . at @xmath77gev",
    ", we predict @xmath78 which agrees with the first zeus measurement @xmath79@xmath80 @xcite .",
    "fig.3 represents our predictions for @xmath81 @xmath82 .",
    "the steady decrease of @xmath83 with @xmath13 reflects a larger contribution from large - size dipoles to the @xmath84 production amplitude , i.e. , @xmath85 @xcite as a very specific prediction of the color dipole approach .",
    "the available experimental data @xcite confirm @xmath86 but the error bars ate still quite large .",
    "here the keyword is the node effect - the @xmath13 and energy dependent cancellations from the large and small size contributions to the production amplitude of the @xmath5 vector mesons .",
    "the @xmath13 and energy dependence of the node effect follows from the @xmath13 dependence of the scanning radius ( which is close to the node position @xmath87 ) and from the different energy dependence of the dipole cross section at small ( @xmath88 ) and large ( @xmath89 ) dipole sizes . in this case",
    "the predictive power becomes very weak .    in the nonrelativistic limit of heavy quarkonia ,",
    "the node effect does not depend on the polarization of the virtual photon and of the produced vector meson .",
    "not so for light vector mesons due to the different wave functions for the @xmath84 and @xmath51 polarized photons and to the fact that different regions of @xmath25 contribute to the @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "two cases can occur in the @xmath3 production amplitude ; the undercompensation and the overcompensation scenario @xcite . in the undercompensation case ,",
    "the @xmath3 production amplitude is dominated by the positive contribution coming from small dipole sizes @xmath92 and the @xmath6 and @xmath5 photoproduction amplitudes have the same sign . with our model wave functions this scenario is realized for @xmath84 polarized @xmath93 and @xmath94 . in this scenario ,",
    "a decrease of the scanning radius with @xmath13 leads to a rapid rise of the @xmath95 production ratio with @xmath13 @xcite , see fig .  4 ; then at @xmath96gev@xmath18 the @xmath5 and @xmath6 production cross sections become comparable , when the production amplitudes are dominated by a dipole size @xmath97 @xcite .",
    "an interesting situation occurs in the production of @xmath51 polarized @xmath93 and @xmath94 mesons , where our model wave functions predict overcompensation ; at @xmath75gev@xmath18 the amplitude is dominated by the negative contribution coming from large dipole sizes @xmath98 .",
    "consequently , with the increase of @xmath13 , the scanning radius decreases and one has the _ exact _ cancellation of the large and small dipole size contributions to the production amplitude .",
    "we find this exact node effect at some value @xmath99gev@xmath18 for both @xmath93 and @xmath94 production ( see fig .  3 ) .",
    "decreasing further @xmath12 , the overcompensation scenarion goes into the above described undercompensation one and for both the @xmath84 and @xmath51 polarized mesons we predict a steep rise with @xmath13 of the @xmath95 ratios on the scale @xmath100gev@xmath18 . at large @xmath13 where the production of @xmath51 polarized mesons dominates , the @xmath101 and @xmath102 cross section ratios level off at @xmath103 ( see fig .  4 ) . due to the different node effect for the @xmath84 and @xmath51 polarizations , we find @xmath104 , see fig .  3 .",
    "5 represents the color dipole model prediction for the @xmath13 dependence of the polarization - unseparated forward cross section ratios @xmath105 and @xmath106 at @xmath107gev .",
    "the anomalous properties of @xmath108 ( due to its smallness ) at small @xmath13 are essentially invisible in the polarization - unseparated @xmath5 production cross section shown in fig .",
    "the @xmath51 polarized @xmath5 we have an onset of the overcompensation scenario . at moderate energy and @xmath13 very close to but smaller then @xmath109 , the negative contribution from @xmath98 takes over in the @xmath5 production amplitude . because of a steeper energy rise of the dipole cross section at smaller dipole sizes , the positive contribution to the production amplitude coming from the region below the node position rises faster with energy and gradually takes over . at some intermediate energy",
    ", we find an exact cancellation of these two contributions to the production amplitude and a minimum of the @xmath5 production cross section .",
    "4 shows such a nonmonotonic energy dependence of the @xmath93 and @xmath94 production at @xmath110gev@xmath18 which corresponds to our model wave functions . at higher @xmath13 and smaller scanning radii @xmath12",

    "we have presented the phenomenology of diffractive photo- and electroproduction of @xmath112 and @xmath3 vector mesons in the framework of the color dipole gbfkl dynamics .",
    "there are two main aspects of vector meson production coming from the gbfkl dynamics .",
    "first , the energy dependence of the @xmath112 vector meson production is controlled by the energy dependence of the dipole cross section which is steeper for smaller dipole sizes .",
    "this results in a steeper rise with energy of the production cross section at higher @xmath13 and/or for heavy vector mesons .",
    "second , the @xmath13 dependence of the @xmath112 vector meson production is controlled by the shrinkage of the transverse size of the virtual photon and the small - size dependence of the color dipole cross section .",
    "we present a good quantitative description of the experimental data on diffractive @xmath50 and @xmath62 photo- and electroproduction which confirms the consequences of the gbfkl dynamics mentioned above .    for the production of the @xmath5 radially excited vector mesons ,",
    "we predict a rich pattern of anomalous @xmath13 and energy dependence as compared to a smooth @xmath13 and energy dependence for the @xmath6 ground state vector mesons .",
    "these anomalies come from the node in the @xmath3 radial wave function in conjuction with the scanning phenomenon and the energy dependence of the dipole cross section .",
    "we predict a very strong suppression of the @xmath95 production ratio in the real photoproduction limit . for the production of @xmath51 polarized @xmath3 mesons we find an overcompensation scenario leading to a sharp dip in the production cross section at some finite @xmath113gev@xmath18 .",
    "the position of this dip is energy dependent and leads to a nonmonotonic energy dependence of @xmath114 at fixed @xmath13 .",
    "the relative sign of the @xmath115 and @xmath50 production amplitude can be measured directly using the sding - pumplin method . at larger @xmath13 ,",
