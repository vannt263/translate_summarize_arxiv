    "the production of hadrons at large transverse momentum @xmath4 ( in hadron - hadron or hadron - photon collisions ) offers a classical test of perturbative qcd .",

    "therefore , all the building blocks of the large-@xmath4 cross sections are in principle known , and the comparison with data provides interesting tests of the theory",
    ".    the hadroproduction of large-@xmath4 @xmath0 mesons has been studied by the cggrw collaboration @xcite , who obtained good agreement between the qcd predictions and collider @xmath0 cross sections . on the other hand , fixed - target data with a lower center - of - mass",
    "energy @xmath6 ( 23  gev@xmath7  gev ) overshoot the theoretical predictions , and it was impossible to obtain an overall agreement with all the large-@xmath4 @xmath0 data . large-@xmath4",
    "charged - hadron cross sections were studied in hadroproduction at collider energies @xcite and in photoproduction at hera energies @xcite . in that case , reasonable agreement between theory and data was reached , but one must remember that these predictions are sensitive to the choice of the factorization and renormalization scales in the @xmath4-range which was studied ( @xmath8  gev ) .    in this paper , we come back to the study of the large-@xmath4 @xmath0 cross sections . new fixed - target data appeared recently @xcite , completing those already available in the range @xmath9  gev @xcite . on the theoretical side , new sets of fragmentation",
    "function extracted from lep data are now available @xcite .",
    "one must also notice that @xmath10 has increased from @xmath11 200 mev to @xmath11 300 mev since the time of the first study @xcite .",
    "this new value of @xmath12 gives rise to a non - negligible increase of the qcd cross section in the @xmath4 range studied here ( @xmath8  gev ) .",
    "another important reason for this study is the publication of new data on prompt - photon cross sections @xcite .",
    "a recent qcd analysis of all fixed - target and isr data @xcite leads to the conclusion that theory is in reasonable agreement with experiment , with the exception of two data sets , as shown in fig .",
    "[ xtcteqpt2 ] .",
    "however , it should be remembered that the comparison with qcd predictions can only be done for high - enough values of @xmath4 ( _ e.g. _  @xmath13  gev / c for the e706 and isr energy ranges ) , where the scale dependence of the theoretical cross sections is not too large .",
    "therefore , in fig .  [ xtcteqpt2 ] , one should not consider the first points of the e706 and isr experiments .",
    "the introduction of an additional intrinsic transverse momentum @xmath14 of the incoming partons , strongly advocated in refs .",
    "@xcite to enforce agreement between qcd predictions and experiment , is not a very satisfactory solution ; the agreement with the e706 data sets is improved , but the agreement with other data sets is reduced .",
    "this situation is challenging and leads us to look at large-@xmath4 @xmath0 production .",
    "the large-@xmath4 @xmath0 mesons form a significant background for the prompt photons , and their cross section must be carefully measured in order to allow for a reliable estimate of the `` fake prompt photons , '' in particular due to configurations in which one photon from the decaying @xmath0 escapes detection .",
    "therefore , there is a strong experimental correlation between the prompt - photon and the @xmath0 cross sections , especially at low @xmath4 values , where the @xmath0 background is largest .",
    "a study of the latter could bring some clarification on the prompt - photon puzzle .",
    "section 2 of this paper is devoted to a discussion of the theoretical calculation of the @xmath0 cross sections .",
    "we emphasize the uncertainties associated with the qcd scales , the determination of the fragmentation functions and the importance of the higher - order ( ho ) corrections .",
    "we discuss the comparison of theoretical predictions with data at fixed - target energies in section 3 and with data at higher energies in section 4 .",
    "section 5 contains the conclusions .",
    "at nlo , the inclusive cross section for the hadroproduction of a single hadron @xmath15 , differential in the transverse momentum @xmath4 and the pseudorapidity @xmath16 of @xmath15 , takes the following form :    @xmath17 . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the parton densities of the incoming hadrons @xmath18 and @xmath19 are given by @xmath20 and @xmath21 ; the fragmentation of a parton @xmath22 into the hadron @xmath15 is described by the fragmentation function @xmath23 ; @xmath24 is the born cross section of the subprocess @xmath25 ; and @xmath26 is the corresponding ho correction term . in this paper , we shall use the abfow @xcite , cteq @xcite and mrst @xcite parton densities . for the fragmentation functions",
    ", we shall use the parametrization of ref .",
    "these fragmentation functions were derived from fits to charged - pion spectra , but we make the usual assumption , supported by data , that the rate of @xmath0 production is half of that for charged pions .",
    "they are preferable to the parametrizations of ref .",
    "@xcite , which predate the publication of the lep hadronic spectra .    expression ( [ 1e ] ) depends on the initial- and final - state factorization scales , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and on the renormalization scale @xmath29 .",
    "the cross section @xmath30 , calculated to all orders in @xmath31 , is independent of @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "however , the perturbative series calculated at fixed order in @xmath31 does depend on these scales , the compensation between the variations of @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 and those of @xmath36 being incomplete .",
    "therefore , we shall carefully explore the scale dependence of the cross section ( [ 1e ] ) .",
    "on the one hand , we shall use `` standard scales '' @xmath37 , with @xmath38 varying around @xmath39 , and , on the other hand , we shall fix the scales by using the principle of minimum sensitivity ( pms ) @xcite , @xmath40 which determines the optimal scales @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 . an illustration of the scale sensitivity",
    "is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig2.ps ] , where the differential cross section for the inclusive production of single @xmath0 mesons , with @xmath44  gev / c and @xmath45 , through the scattering of 530  gev / c protons on a fixed beryllium target is considered .",
    "specifically , the contours of constant cross section are shown in the @xmath46 plane .",
    "for each set @xmath46 , @xmath29 is determined by the first equality in eq .",
    "( [ 2e ] ) .",
    "as expected , one finds a minimum , corresponding to the optimal choice defined by eq .",
    "( [ 2e ] ) , but one also notices that the area of stability under changes of scales around this optimal point is not very large . it is smaller than in the case of prompt - photon production .",
    "we noticed in several numerical studies that it is not possible to verify the pms criterion ( [ 2e ] ) for too small values of @xmath4 , typically for @xmath47  gev / c .",
    "this indicates that the ho corrections are large and that the qcd predictions are quite unstable under changes of scales .",
    "therefore , we shall emphasize the comparison between theory and experiment at @xmath13  gev / c , although we shall also explore smaller @xmath4 values .",
    "since working in the optimal scheme is rather cumbersome and requires a lot of numerical work , we compare , in general , theory predictions for fixed scales with experiment .",
    "we use the standard choices @xmath48 and @xmath49 . as will be discussed later , the optimal scales , derived from eq .",
    "( [ 2e ] ) , turn out to interpolate between these two choices , depending on the kinematical range considered .    besides the scale dependence , there are other sources of uncertainties in eq .",
    "( [ 1e ] ) , which come from the parton densities and the fragmentation functions .",
    "the parton densities are generally determined with good accuracy . however , at small @xmath4 and for scale @xmath50 , the factorization scale may approach the starting scale @xmath51 of the qcd evolution . in this region ,",
    "the parton densities are not constrained by data . to avoid this problem when using the scale @xmath50 , we thus require @xmath4 to be larger than 4.5  gev / c .    another source of uncertainty concerns the fragmentation functions .",
    "the quark fragmentation is now well constrained by petra , pep and lep data @xcite . however , the dominant support to eq .",
    "( [ 1e ] ) comes from the large-@xmath52 domain , where the @xmath53 data are scarce .",
    "for instance , numerical studies of eq .",
    "( [ 1e ] ) indicate that the mean @xmath52 value is about 0.85 for @xmath54  gev / c and @xmath55  gev .",
    "there are very few data points in the range @xmath56 ( zero or one point in most data sets ) , and they have large error bars .",
    "therefore , we expect the uncertainty coming from the fragmentation functions to be of the order of a few tens of percents .",
    "it must also be noticed that the gluon fragmentation function is not well determined by @xmath5 data , since it appears there only at nlo . more constraints could , in principle , be obtained from inclusive pion production at large transverse momentum in hadronic collisions .",
    "for example , the inclusive large-@xmath4 charged - hadron cross section has been measured by the ua1 collaboration @xcite in the range @xmath57  gev / c .",
    "these data are compatible with the parametrization of ref .",
    "@xcite , but they are also compatible with the same parametrization after the normalization of the gluon fragmentation function has been increased by 30% to 40% .",
    "( such a large change in the gluon fragmentation function is still compatible with the @xmath5 data . )",
    "this gives us an estimate of the flexibility in the gluon parametrization .",
    "we remark that changing the gluon fragmentation function may affect the slope of the @xmath4 distributions , since the low @xmath58 regions will be more strongly affected . besides these problems related to the @xmath52 behavior of the fragmentation functions",
    ", we should remark that we are led to explore small fragmentation scales ( in particular , when using @xmath59 ) far away from the kinematical regions where the fits are performed . in summary ,",
    "hadronic data require large @xmath52 values and small scales , while the fragmentation functions are ( mostly ) extracted from @xmath5 data at medium @xmath52 values and large scales .",
    "finally , let us mention that we do not use theoretical expression in which the large @xmath60 terms present in the ho corrections are resummed @xcite .",
    "indeed , in order to be coherent , one should also use resummed expressions when extracting fragmentation functions from @xmath5 data .",
    "such an analysis has not been done so far .",
    "it would certainly be very interesting to pursue phenomenological studies in this direction @xcite .",
    "one must , however , keep in mind that the optimization procedure of stevenson and politzer @xcite amounts to a partial resummation of the @xmath60 terms @xcite .    for all these reasons , we do not expect a very good agreement between fixed - target data and qcd predictions .",
    "the expected agreement should only be within a few tens of percent . at larger energies , the mean value of @xmath52 is smaller and the sensitivity to the scale variations is reduced .",
    "a better agreement is therefore expected and has been verified in previous studies @xcite .",
    "this point will be discussed later .    in this paper ,",
    "all the calculations are performed in the @xmath61 scheme .",
    "the value of @xmath12 in @xmath31 , calculated at two loops , is taken to be equal to the one used in the parton densities .",
    "the data that we are going to discuss are displayed in fig .",
    "[ allpio ] . unlike what was observed in the case of prompt - photon production , the @xmath0 data taken at the same energy are quite compatible with each other , with the exception of isr data at @xmath62  gev , where the r806 @xcite and afs @xcite data disagree for @xmath63  gev / c .",
    "the increase in cross sections as @xmath6 increases at fixed @xmath4 is also visible .",
    "let us emphasize that we only consider @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 data in order to reduce the uncertainties due to the parton densities of the incoming hadrons .",
    "we do not study @xmath67 data , but concentrate on proton - induced fixed - target data and isr data in the energy range below @xmath62  gev .",
    "in what follows , we consider only the range @xmath68  gev / c , which is covered by almost all data sets . with this cut",
    ", we also efficiently suppress possible non - perturbative contributions to the cross sections , such as power corrections , intrinsic @xmath14 effects , _",
    "etc_.    in fig .",
    "[ fig4ps ] , we show the effects of the variation in the parton densities and scales on the predictions for the wa70 experiment @xcite . for both scale choices , @xmath69 and @xmath50 , we observe the following hierarchy : abfow and cteq5 m lead to the smallest and largest predictions , respectively , while mrst2 leads to an intermediate result .",
    "the result for cteq4 m almost coincides with that for mrst2 and is not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4ps ] .",
    "this hierarchy may be explained by the different @xmath12 values used in the evaluations of @xmath31 . for four quark flavors ,",
    "these are 230 mev for abfow , 296 mev for cteq4 m , 300 mev for mrst2 and 326  mev for cteq5 m .",
    "when @xmath31 is evaluated with a common value of @xmath12 , the four results become very similar .",
    "the effect of the scale choice is also clearly displayed .",
    "one notices a @xmath4-independent increase by roughly a factor of two when the scale is reduced from @xmath69 to @xmath50 .",
    "this is a typical example for the sensitivity of the theory to the scale choice . as we shall see later ,",
    "the results obtained using optimal scales are close to those obtained with scale @xmath50 .",
    "as expected , the agreement between data and theory is not very good . with small scales ( @xmath70 )",
    ", the theory underestimates the data by some 40% to 50% . in fig .",
    "[ fig5ps ] , ua6 @xmath64 data @xcite are compared with the corresponding qcd predictions .",
    "for this experiment , the qcd predictions for scale @xmath50 undershoot the data by some 30% .",
    "similar remarks hold for the e706 data @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig6ps ] , we display data and predictions for @xmath71  gev .",
    "one observes that the curve corresponding to the optimal scales ( labelled pms ) is very close to the one obtained with scale @xmath50 . here",
    "again , the disagreement between theory and data , for scale @xmath50 or optimal scales , is of the order of a few tens of percents .",
    "it is interesting to notice that , with scale @xmath69 , which allows one to extend the predictions down to smaller values of @xmath4 , the theoretical cross section is almost parallel to the data .",
    "therefore , there is no such increase of the ratio of data over theory as was observed in the prompt - photon case ( see fig .  [ xtcteqpt2 ] ) .",
    "very similar conclusions can be drawn from the comparison of the e706 data at @xmath72  gev with theory .",
    "finally , in fig .  [ fig7ps ] , we show the isr r806 data at @xmath73  gev @xcite and the theoretical predictions obtained with scales @xmath69 and @xmath50 . here again , small scales lead to the best agreement with the data .    from this short survey of data and qcd predictions we can draw some preliminary conclusions . as expected , we do not obtain a very good agreement with respect to normalization .",
    "the predictions for scale @xmath50 systematically underestimate the data by some 30% to 50% for all considered experiments . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath4 behavior is well reproduced .",
    "one also notices that all data appear to be consistent with each other .",
    "the above discussion is best summarized by displaying on a linear scale the data as differential cross sections in @xmath58 normalized to the theoretical predictions .",
    "the data , normalized to the nlo predictions evaluated using set mrst2 and a common scale set equal to @xmath69 , are displayed in figs .",
    "[ fig8ps ] and [ fig9ps ] .",
    "we notice that the normalized data are mutually compatible within @xmath74 , and that multiplying the theoretical predictions by a common normalization factor of 2.5 will bring data and theory in reasonable agreement .",
    "it is also interesting to remark that the ratio of data over theory is rather flat and shows no such sharp rise at low @xmath58 as was observed in the prompt - photon production experiments ( see fig .",
    "[ xtcteqpt2 ] ) .",
    "these general features are also found when comparing data and theory with the common scale put equal to @xmath50 .",
    "the results are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig10ps ] and [ fig11ps ] for the mrst2 parton distributions .",
    "the major difference between theory and experiment now resides in a normalization factor of about 1.45 . comparing fig .",
    "[ fig11ps ] with fig .",
    "[ fig9ps ] , one notices the different slope of the data - over - theory ratio at small @xmath58 values , corresponding to @xmath75  gev / c , indicating that the theoretical predictions are rather unstable in this region and can not be trusted .",
    "based on the above analysis of fixed - target data ( wa70 , ua6 , e706 , r806 at @xmath76  gev ) , we reach the following conclusions concerning inclusive single-@xmath0 production .",
    "all data appear to be consistent with each other to within @xmath74 .",
    "however , they differ from the fixed - scale theoretical predictions by a rather large normalization factor , namely @xmath77 for scale @xmath69 and @xmath78 for scale @xmath50 . in the latter case , it is worth investigating if this normalization factor could be accounted for , in the theoretical calculations , by a different choice of fragmentation functions , which are still rather flexible in the kinematical range of interest , as explained in section  [ theory ] .",
    "this situation is to be compared to that of prompt - photon production , where the scattering of data sets is much larger .",
    "in fact , normalized to the theoretical predictions for fixed scales , the measured e706 rate at @xmath79  gev appears two to four times larger than the corresponding wa70 rate .",
    "another feature distinguishes the @xmath0 spectra from the prompt - photon spectra when they are compared to theory . for scale @xmath69 ,",
    "the data - over - theory ratio for the @xmath0 data is rather flat down to rather low @xmath58 values ( see fig .",
    "[ fig9ps ] ) , while the corresponding ratio for the prompt - photon data is found to exhibit a sharp rise for decreasing @xmath58 . for scale",
    "@xmath50 , a rise is observed for both @xmath0 and prompt - photon data , the rise being sharper in the latter case . this change of behavior signals an instability of the theory : for @xmath0 production at e706 energies , a change of scales introduces a change of slope in the @xmath4 spectrum . for wa70 or ua6 energies ,",
    "the change of scales reduces to a change in the overall normalization .",
    "a final remark concerns the energy variation of the @xmath0 spectrum . by comparing data at different energies in the very same experiment",
    ", we are able to better examine the variation with @xmath6 of the theoretical predictions .",
    "this can be done by looking at figs .",
    "[ fig9ps ] and [ fig11ps ] , where e706 data at @xmath80  gev and 38.8  gev are displayed .",
    "we notice a 30% to 40% difference in normalization , which could indicate that the theoretical predictions calculated with fixed scales are not able to follow the energy dependence of the data .",
    "the use of optimized scales does not improve the agreement with data , since the predictions based on scale @xmath50 or optimized scales give very similar results for all data with energy below @xmath81  gev .",
    "in fig .  [ fig13ps ] , we compare two sets of isr data at 63  gev , from the r806  @xcite and afs  @xcite collaborations , with theoretical predictions .",
    "in contrast to the results for lower energies , we observe a remarkable stability in the theoretical predictions for @xmath13  gev / c ( @xmath82 ) : all our scale choices lead to similar predictions .",
    "below @xmath83  gev / c , the predictions diverge .",
    "the choice @xmath69 and the use of optimized scales give similar results , while the choice @xmath50 leads to a cross sections which is smaller by a factor of two .",
    "below @xmath84  gev / c , no conclusion is possible because each data set favours a different scale choice . given the statistical relevance of the r806 data , the choice @xmath69 or the use of optimized scales appear to be most appropriate .",
    "the agreement of theory with both data sets is rather good for @xmath85",
    "gev / c , although the theoretical expectations tend to be somewhat higher than the data , a situation which is different from the fixed - target case .",
    "this fact may be related to the observation made above concerning the energy variation of the data - over - theory ratio .",
    "this can be checked , to an extent which is limited by the relatively large error bars , by comparing the fixed - scale theory to the three sets of r806 data at @xmath86 , 44.8 and 62.8  gev .",
    "we find that , at fixed @xmath58 , this ratio tends to decrease when the energy increases , in agreement with the e706 results .",
    "turning to the ua1 data on charged - pion production @xcite , similar comments as above can be made .",
    "the theoretical predictions at large @xmath4 values , above @xmath87  gev / c , are relatively stable and agree well with the data , while , at lower @xmath4 values , the predictions start to diverge , thus bracketing the experimental points .",
    "the fairest conclusion to be drawn from our studies of pion production in hadronic collisions is that the phenomenology of this process is not yet completely understood !",
    "several problems can be identified .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "the main difficulty lies in the scale instability , which is significant at low energy but disappears for @xmath88  gev , at least for large - enough @xmath4 values .",
    "hopefully , this instability will be partly removed by resumming the large @xmath89 terms associated with the fragmentation process , very much in the way the resummation of threshold factors improved the predictions of prompt - photon production at large transverse momentum @xcite",
    ". this improvement would be important in order to better understand the energy dependence of the cross sections , which , as we have seen , can not be fully understood when using the fixed - scale approach . in the meantime ,",
    "the choice of optimized scales , which is equivalent to setting the scales equal to @xmath50 at fixed - target energies and to @xmath69 at upper isr energies , seems to be the most appropriate one and is anticipated to give results not too far from the resummed theory ( _ cf . _  the case of prompt - photon production ) .    on the phenomenological side",
    ", one needs a second generation of fragmentation functions , based on the resummed approach and also taking account of pion spectra in ( selected ) hadronic collisions . from the @xmath53 data , upon which existing parametrizations are based",
    ", the gluon to pion fragmentation is largely undetermined , and there are very few experimental points to directly constrain the quark to pion fragmentation at very large @xmath52 values .",
    "there is probably enough flexibility in the fragmentation functions to change the size of the predictions for hadronic collisions by 30% or so .",
    "this point is certainly worth a more detailed investigation .",
    "comparing theory with data , the fixed - target data are found to lie systematically above the theory predictions , while the isr data are compatible with or somewhat below the predictions and the ua1 data are in perfect agreement with the predictions .",
    "this problem of energy dependence of the cross section at fixed @xmath58 is particularly manifest in the case of the e706 data .",
    "is this an experimental problem ? is the scale dependence of the theory more involved than expected ? redoing the phenomenology using the resummed approach will probably help to better understand this point .",
    "although confused , the case of @xmath0 production is still much simpler than that of prompt - photon production , where 24  gev and 63  gev data are rather compatible with the predictions , while 30  gev and 40  gev data are much larger . considering only experiments below 40  gev and taking into account the fact that the @xmath0 data taken in those experiments are compatible with each other , this seems to indicate that the systematic errors on prompt - photon production are probably underestimated . in particular ,",
    "the background subtraction necessary to obtain the prompt - photon spectrum should be carefully re - assessed .",
    "it is important for the search of the higgs - boson decay to two photons to understand the production of photons and pions at lhc energies .",
    "given the confused situation at lower energies , after more than twenty years of intense experimental and theoretical efforts , a lot of work remains to be done to achieve this goal .",
