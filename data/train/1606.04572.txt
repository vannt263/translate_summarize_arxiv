    "the bar and spiral patterns of ngc 1365 are among the most studied galactic structures ( e.g. , lindblad 1999 ) .",

    "although photometric features of ngc 1365 are often cited as evidence for category ( 1 ) , the gas kinematics are inconsistent with this category ( sellwood & wilkinson 1993 , and references therein ) .",
