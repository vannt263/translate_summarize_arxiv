    "continuous zero temperature phase transitions have attracted much interest lately , due to a variety of unusual low - temperature properties observed in their vicinity .",
    "experiments on a broad range of materials , including cuprates , heavy fermion compounds and transition metals , have shown thermodynamic , magnetic and transport properties that often do not fit in the framework of the landau fermi liquid theory of metals .",
    "this raises the possibility that the critical ground state may be a new , exotic state of matter . in many cases , understanding such",
    "a transition is rendered difficult by the fact that the phases involved are not well understood .",
    "this is the case for the cuprate superconductors , where even the underlying ` normal ' state remains a subject of some debate , and for many heavy fermion materials , which involve a nontrivial interplay between the f - electron magnetic moments and conduction electron sea .",
    "thus , it is important to study a case of a simple magnetic metal , where both the magnetic and the paramagnetic phases , as well as the nature of the transition , are believed to be well understood .",
    "the cr@xmath1v@xmath2 alloy is an ideal candidate for such a study ( see reviews @xcite ) .",
    "pure chromium is a textbook example of a nesting - driven antiferromagnet , where doping with vanadium suppresses the nel temperature t@xmath3 to zero already at @xmath4 . in recent experiments on cr@xmath1v@xmath2 , @xcite",
    "t@xmath3 has been driven to zero by pressure , which allows access to the quantum critical point with minimal involvement of doping - induced disorder .",
    "of various thermodynamic and transport properties near a quantum critical point , the hall transport attracted particular interest lately , as it carries information about the change of the fermi surface volume in an interacting system @xcite . here",
    "we will stay within an sdw description , for which the corresponding quantum critical point is above the upper critical dimension @xcite .",
    "we will focus exclusively on the static transport coefficients and , with the goal of treating the problem within the simplest possible model , confine ourselves to a mean - field approach .",
    "while the behavior of the electric conductivity near the onset of a density wave within such an approach has been studied early on @xcite , the hall conductivity has not been investigated until recently , when it was discussed for an sdw @xcite and for d - density wave order @xcite .",
    "standard expressions @xcite give electric and hall conductivities in terms of integrals over the fermi surface . when evaluating them , one has to take into account the fermi surface change in the ordered state , as well as the change of fermi velocities and mass tensors .",
    "consequently , developing intuition about the behavior of these quantities is non - trivial .    in our earlier work @xcite",
    ", we considered a model in which the fermi surface contains completely flat portions .",
    "in that case , the hall number has a discontinuity at the quantum critical point , but the hall conductivity does not change due to the zero curvature of the flat parts .",
    "moreover , if the tuning parameter ( such as pressure ) does not change the elastic scattering , the hall coefficient should scale as the square of the longitudinal resistivity .",
    "this behavior was confirmed by detailed numerical simulations based on the actual fermi surface of chromium , and the results were in good agreement with hall data @xcite across the doping induced quantum phase transition in cr@xmath1v@xmath2 .",
    "fermi surfaces , however , are never perfectly flat .",
    "the finite curvature becomes especially important in the immediate vicinity of the quantum critical point , which has become experimentally accessible with pressure in cr@xmath1v@xmath2 .",
    "@xcite in this paper , we address this regime in some detail by considering the rice model @xcite .",
    "the model , motivated by the electronic structure of chromium , incorporates an electron fermi surface and a hole fermi surface that are nearly nested but do have a finite curvature ; moreover , it takes into account an electron reservoir that mimics other bands .",
    "we determine the transport coefficients using a geometric approach .",
    "we find that most transport coefficients display a leading dependence that is linear in the energy gap .",
    "however , due to cancellation of the electron and hole contributions , the hall conductivity @xmath0 is essentially unaffected by the onset of magnetism , even in the immediate vicinity of the quantum critical point .",
    "the insensitivity of @xmath0 to magnetism is , therefore , a robust feature of the model over a wide range of parameters across the magnetic quantum phase transition .",
    "this conclusion is in agreement with the experiments @xcite .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we discuss the fermi surface of cr , and the rice model used in this paper @xcite . in section iii ,",
    "we discuss the changes in the electron spectrum upon magnetic ordering . in section iv",
    ", we describe a geometric picture @xcite that affords a simple description of the transport coefficients near the quantum critical point in cr@xmath1v@xmath2 . in section",
    "v , we discuss numerical calculations based on the actual band structure of cr .",
    "some conclusions are offered in section vi .",
    "calculational details are described in the appendices .",
    "the fermi surface of chromium consists of several sheets and is well accounted for by band structure calculations @xcite .",
    "it is believed that the interaction between two particular sheets : the @xmath5-sheet , centered around the @xmath5-point , and the h - sheet , centered around the h - point , is responsible for the magnetism .",
    "these sheets are nearly nested ; as a result , an sdw with nesting wave vector @xmath6 emerges , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chr_fs_sketch ] . in chromium ,",
    "the sdw is of the linear type , which means @xcite that both @xmath7 and @xmath8 nesting is relevant .",
    "the relative size of the fermi surface ( fs ) sheets can be changed by doping with vanadium .",
    "it is believed that the dominant effect of the doping is to change the electron concentration , which corresponds to the shift of the chemical potential @xmath9 . as @xmath9 shifts with increasing hole doping @xmath10 , the mismatch between the @xmath5-surface and the h - surface increases .",
    "the h - sheet grows and the @xmath5-sheet diminishes in size .",
    "this leads to the change of wave vector with concentration @xmath11 . at the critical doping @xmath12 ,",
    "the mismatch becomes so large that the sdw formation is not energetically favorable any more .    to allow for an analytic treatment",
    ", we will employ the rice model of itinerant antiferromagnetism @xcite that involves an electron and a hole fermi surface of spherical shape and unequal size .",
    "the fermi surface of chromium is certainly far from being spherical @xcite .",
    "however , it is not completely flat , and therefore the nearly nested parts can be fairly accurately approximated by spherical segments .",
    "it is these parts that are important in the development of the sdw .",
    "also , as long as the sdw gap is small , only these parts are destroyed by the gap opening .",
    "this is why a model that considers a spherical fs will give the correct behavior of physical quantities as @xmath13 .",
    "the highly curved , non - nested parts of the @xmath5-and h - sheets will introduce corrections only when @xmath14 becomes large .",
    "we consider spherical fermi surfaces of radii @xmath15 for the electron surface and @xmath16 for the hole surface .",
    "wherever possible [ for exceptions , see secs . [",
    "sec : linear_conductivity_touching_spheres ] , [ sec : hall - touching ] ] , we will linearize the spectrum : @xmath17    we will present an analytic treatment of two cases ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fs_inner_positioning ] ) . in the first case , upon translation by @xmath18",
    ", the electron fermi surface crosses the hole fermi surface . in the second case ,",
    "the two fermi surfaces touch each other upon translation .",
    "the latter case is never realized in the rice model : the maximum in the susceptibility is at a @xmath6 vector corresponding to crossing spheres @xcite .",
    "note that in fig .",
    "[ fig : fs_inner_positioning ] , the model hole surface is shown displaced only by the @xmath7 vector , while in the real situation of chromium ( fig .",
    "[ fig : chr_fs_sketch ] ) both the @xmath7 and the @xmath8 displacements lead to nesting and should be considered .",
    "this is done for simplicity , and also because our analytic calculation is intended to give only the functional form of the @xmath14 dependence .",
    "taking into account both displacements changes only the value of the coefficient , not the leading power of the dependence . in appendix",
    "[ appendix : linear_vs_helical ] , we explain how the full result for the linear sdw is related to that of the @xmath7 displacement only .",
    "there are other sheets of the fermi surface of chromium that are not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chr_fs_sketch ] .",
    "they do not cause the sdw formation , but are also modified by the onset of the sdw , and thus their contribution to the transport coefficients changes as well .",
    "the changes of those fermi surfaces will correspond to the crossing case of fig .",
    "[ fig : fs_inner_positioning ] , and our analysis applies to them as well , as long as we are interested only in the leading power in the dependence of transport coefficients on the energy gap @xmath14 .",
    "onset of a linear sdw generates a non - zero matrix element @xmath14 between the single - electron states connected by the ordering wave vector @xmath19 .",
    "these matrix elements are independent of spin  @xcite ( as opposed to the case of a helical sdw ) . as a result ,",
    "a gap opens at all momenta @xmath20 and @xmath21 , related by the resonance condition @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the single - particle spectrum in the paramagnetic state .",
    "when the chemical potential falls inside the gap , some parts of the original ( paramagnetic state ) fermi surface disappear , and the fs sheets reconnect as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fs_inner_positioning ] .    in the following , we neglect smaller gaps that appear whenever two single - particle states meet a higher - order resonance condition @xmath24 with @xmath25 , since the magnitude of these higher - order gaps decreases rapidly with @xmath26 , as @xmath27 .    in chromium , the condition @xmath28 is fulfilled only for electrons belonging to different ( hole - like and electron - like ) bands .",
    "the same is true for the rice model .",
    "thus the spectrum in the ordered state takes the form @xmath29 as discussed in the previous section , to find the functional dependence of physical quantities on @xmath14 , we will use only one sign of @xmath6 in the formula for @xmath30 ( see appendix  [ appendix : linear_vs_helical ] ) .",
    "thus we will consider one electron band and one displaced hole band .",
    "the original spherical fermi surfaces of electrons and holes are given by the equations @xmath31 if the electron reservoir provided by other sheets of the fermi surface is large , the gap opening does not lead to a shift of the chemical potential .",
    "the new fermi surfaces are then given by @xmath32 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fs_inner_positioning ] , when the sdw gap opens , the fermi surfaces reconnect . instead of the two original spherical fermi surfaces ,",
    "one gets a larger hole fs and a smaller lens - shaped electron fs .",
    "the latter corresponds to the @xmath33 sign , while the former corresponds to the @xmath34 sign in eq .",
    "[ eq : newfs ] . in the touching case",
    ", there is no lens , thus only the @xmath34 sign is relevant . for either sign , this equation is equivalent to @xmath35 this may be complicated in @xmath36-space , but is very simple in the space of @xmath37 .",
    "the velocities in the modified bands are : @xmath38 in this formula , velocities @xmath39 on the right hand side are taken at the same momentum @xmath40 , so one or both of them have to be evaluated far from the corresponding original electron or hole fermi surfaces .",
    "away from the points where the electron and the hole fermi surfaces cross or touch each other , the new fermi surface is close to one of them .",
    "quantitatively , this means that the distance between the new and old surfaces is much smaller then the distance between fs@xmath41 and fs@xmath42 .",
    "the corresponding condition reads ( for definiteness , we write it here for one of the branches ) : @xmath43 which , using ( [ eq : e ] ) , can be re - expressed as @xmath44 the crossover from large to small deviation of the new fermi surface from the old one takes place at @xmath45    the above equations neglect the variation of the chemical potential @xmath9 upon onset of ordering .",
    "the ordering wave vector @xmath18 also changes , and the dependences @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 on doping , @xmath10 , need to be found self - consistently . within the framework of the rice model ,",
    "this was done within a mean - field treatment in the original paper @xcite . both @xmath47 and @xmath48 turn out to depend on doping linearly : @xmath49 while @xmath46 shows the standard mean - field dependence @xmath50 .",
    "hence , in the immediate vicinity of the transition , the leading dependence of the transport coefficients on doping is defined implicitly by the dependence on @xmath46 , and can be found neglecting the variation of @xmath9 and @xmath18 .",
    "we now turn to finding this dependence .",
    "in the boltzmann equation approach , the conductivity is given by the integral @xmath51 where @xmath52 , @xmath53 is the electron charge , @xmath54 is the fermi surface element in @xmath36-space , and @xmath55 is the electron scattering time , hereafter assumed isotropic @xcite . in the sdw phase , this expression differs from that in the paramagnetic state in two ways .",
    "first , the integrand contains velocities defined by ( [ eq : v ] ) and , second , the integration is performed over the modified fermi surface , given by ( [ eq : fs ] ) .",
    "an analytic calculation is straightforward ( see appendix  [ appendix : electric_conductivity ] ) , but here we estimate the integral ( [ eq : sigmaintegral ] ) using geometric considerations , which will allow us to develop an intuitive picture .",
    "first , we perform an estimate in the crossing case . when the gap opens , the original fermi surfaces disappear in belts of width @xmath56 and radius @xmath57 determined by the positioning of the spheres ( see fig.[fig : fs_inner_positioning](a ) . for clarity , only @xmath58 and @xmath59 are shown in the inset ) .",
    "the width of the disappearing belt can be evaluated using ( [ eq : crossover ] ) . for an infinitesimal @xmath14",
    ", it implies that the original electron and hole fermi surfaces are destroyed in belts of width @xmath60 ( see appendix  [ appendix : electric_conductivity ] for details ) .",
    "this formula is valid only in the crossing case , where @xmath61 .",
    "disappearance of the belts is accompanied by fermi surface reconnection , i.e. new portions of the fs are created . as seen from fig.[fig : fs_inner_positioning](a ) , the area of the new fs is also proportional to @xmath14 .    before the opening of the gap , the belts were giving a contribution of approximately @xmath62 to @xmath63 .",
    "in this formula , the index @xmath64 is the direction in which the conductivity is measured . for the spherical fermi surfaces considered here ,",
    "two distinct directions exist : one along the line connecting the centers of the fs@xmath41 and fs@xmath42 spheres , and another one perpendicular to it . the conductivities along these directions are denoted @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively . for",
    "both of them , the velocity projections are zeroeth order in @xmath14 , thus the contribution of the belts is proportional to their areas , i.e. first order in @xmath14 .",
    "fermi velocities on the reconnecting parts of the fs are given by ( [ eq : v ] ) and thus are also zeroeth order in @xmath14 . therefore the contribution of these parts is first order in @xmath14 as well .",
    "thus , when the belts disappear , and the reconnecting parts are created , the change of @xmath67 is @xmath68      next , we estimate the change of conductivity in the touching case . here , ( [ eq : fs ] ) implies that the old fermi surfaces are destroyed in the circles centered at the touching point ( see fig.[fig : fs_inner_positioning](b ) ) . in a coordinate system with axes along @xmath69 and perpendicular to it , @xmath70 that gives for both fs@xmath71 @xmath72 using now ( [ eq : crossover ] ) and ( [ eq : touching_energy ] ) to obtain the radius @xmath73 of the destroyed circle , we find @xmath74 .",
    "the area of the destroyed patches of the fermi surfaces is @xmath75 .",
    "the area of the reconnecting surface can be estimated as the area of a cylinder with a radius of order @xmath76 and height @xmath77 .",
    "thus the area of the reconnecting fs part is of order @xmath78 .",
    "in contrast with the crossing case , the integrand of ( [ eq : sigmaintegral ] ) in the touching case strongly depends on the direction @xmath64 . for @xmath65 , it is simply equal to @xmath79 , i.e. , zeroeth order in @xmath14 , so the contribution of the destroyed part of the fermi surface is @xmath80 . by virtue of the argument already used for the crossing case ,",
    "the integrand for the reconnecting part is also zeroeth order in @xmath14 .",
    "since the area of the reconnecting fermi surface is higher order then the one of the disappearing fs , its contribution can be neglected .",
    "therefore , the change of the parallel conductivity is given by @xmath81    for @xmath66 , the integrand of ( [ eq : sigmaintegral ] ) is much smaller , because the projection of @xmath82 on the perpendicular direction vanishes as one approaches the touching point .",
    "the characteristic value of the projection is @xmath83 , thus the contribution of the disappearing part of the fs to @xmath66 is @xmath84 .",
    "for the same reason as in the calculation of @xmath65 , the value of the integrand on the reconnecting parts of the fs is of the same order @xmath76 .",
    "consequently , the contribution of these parts is of higher order ( @xmath85 ) and can be neglected .",
    "one obtains : @xmath86    formulae ( [ eq : delta_sigma_estimate],[eq : delta_sigmapar_touching],[eq : delta_sigmaperp_touching ] ) can be compared with those obtained by elliott and wedgwood @xcite . for the touching case ,",
    "our results are identical to theirs , while for the crossing case , ref .",
    "gives @xmath87 , @xmath88 .",
    "the discrepancy with ( [ eq : delta_sigma_estimate ] ) arises from the fact that ref .",
    "considers crossing of two spheres with equal fermi momenta and fermi velocities , while in the rice model , generically , the sizes of the spheres differ . coinciding fermi momenta and fermi velocities",
    "lead to the cancellation of tems linear in @xmath14 , which can not be captured by geometrical reasoning .",
    "this point is further explained in appendix  [ appendix : electric_conductivity ] .",
    "the hall conductivity @xmath89 has the form @xmath90 , where , for small magnetic fields  @xcite , @xmath91 the change of this quantity upon onset of the sdw is found by calculating the difference between the integrals above in the sdw state ( with the modified fermi surface and fermi velocities ) and in the paramagnetic state .",
    "however , performing such a calculation for the linearized spectrum ( [ eq : e12 ] ) , one finds @xmath92 .",
    "this is due to the fact that although the curvature of the fermi surface changes significantly upon reconnection of the two fermi surface sheets , the two connecting arcs give equal contributions of opposite sign , which cancel each other exactly for a linear spectrum .",
    "thus , one has to expand @xmath93 up to quadratic terms in @xmath94 even in the crossing case .    instead of performing the calculation based on ( [ eq : hall_conductivity_classic ] ) , one can find the leading power in the dependence of @xmath95 on @xmath14 in a more intuitive way by using the approach of ong @xcite . in this method ,",
    "the fermi surface is divided into slices perpendicular to the magnetic field @xmath96 .",
    "the contribution of each slice to the hall conductivity is given by the area @xmath97 inside the contour plot of @xmath98 .",
    "for @xmath99 , @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the magnetic radius , and the total hall conductivity is given by the integral @xmath102 variation of @xmath103 at each slice @xmath104 upon onset of the sdw can be found from simple geometric considerations , which we describe below .    in the rice model , the fermi surface has cylindrical symmetry around the direction of @xmath69 .",
    "accordingly , there are two distinct elements of the @xmath105 tensor .",
    "we denote them @xmath106 and @xmath107 , where parallel and perpendicular refers to the mutual orientation of @xmath69 and @xmath96 . in the coordinate system",
    "where @xmath69 points along @xmath108 , the conductivity tensor in a magnetic field has the form @xmath109    below , we find the functional forms of @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",

    "consider a cross - section of @xmath36-space perpendicular to @xmath115 ( @xmath117 cross - section ) .",
    "this cross - section cuts the electron and the hole fermi surfaces along the circles and , depending on the value of @xmath104 , these circles may or may not cross .",
    "when they do cross , the contour plot of @xmath118 is significantly modified due to opening of the gap . a typical modification of the fermi surface cross - section upon transition from the paramagnetic to the sdw state is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : v_contour_crossing ] , as well as the corresponding modification of the @xmath118 contour plot . note that , in this plot , all @xmath40 and @xmath118 vectors are projections of the corresponding three - dimensional vectors on the @xmath117 plane .",
    "this means that the diameters of the circles in the contour plot of @xmath118 are not @xmath119 and @xmath120 , but instead are given by the absolute value of the projections .",
    "however , to keep notation compact , we do not explicitly show this in the following discussion .    near the crossing points @xmath121 in @xmath36-space ( fig .",

    "this slow convergence can be traced to the problem of switching from the antiferromagnetic @xmath168 basis to the paramagnetic @xmath93 basis for the energy bands as the energy gap goes to zero , which as we stated in the earlier paper , would lead to a discontinuity in the hall number for a perfectly flat fermi surface .",

    "one of them defines a hole octahedron around the @xmath169 point as well as hole ellipsoids around the @xmath170 points .",
    "the second defines an electron octahedron about the @xmath5 point .",
    "the third defines electron balls centered around the @xmath171 lines .",
    "( in this paper , we ignore the third band when computing the transport integrals , thus the electronic structure becomes of the same two band form , as described in the previous sections . )",
    "the paramagnetic band structure is constructed from the local density approximation using a linear muffin tin orbital method with muffin tin overlap corrections , and spin - orbit treated in a semi - relativistic fashion .",
    "after convergence , eigenvalues were generated at 506 @xmath36 points in the irreducible ( 1/48th ) wedge of the brillouin zone .",
    "these were then fit by a 910 function fourier series ( spline fit ) , which allows eigenvalues to be generated for an arbitrary @xmath36 .",
    "an sdw gap is then introduced as in the previous sections . because of the convergence issues mentioned above , the calculation was carried out to even higher precision than in our previous work .",
    "that is , the transport integrals are performed using the linear tetrahedron method with the momentum sums involving over 805 million tetrahedra in the paramagnetic zone .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : numeric](a ) , we show results for the longitudinal ( @xmath65 ) and transverse ( @xmath66 ) conductivities ( assuming a single @xmath172 domain ) .",
    "the variation is indeed linear in @xmath14 for both cases , in agreement with the analytic results ( crossing case ) .",
    "= 3.4 in    the @xmath14-dependence of @xmath173 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : numeric](b ) .",
    "the value of @xmath173 hardly changes as the sdw gap @xmath14 ( equivalently , the magnetic order parameter ) sets in .",
    "this is a consequence of the flatness of the octahedral surfaces along with the electron - hole compensation of the @xmath5 and @xmath169 sheets in the regions where they nest ( the large absolute magnitude of @xmath173 is mostly coming from the @xmath170 ellipsoids , which are essentially unaffected by the magnetism ) .",
    "we can , though , test the analytic dependence derived earlier by looking at the individual contributions of the + and - bands , which we also plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : numeric](b ) . a clear linear @xmath14 dependence is seen .",
    "interestingly , the two linear terms have opposite sign with almost equal magnitude , which is a reflection of the electron - hole compensation in this basis .",
    "we have also tested our argument further by numerically determining @xmath173 for the rice model with unequal - sized spheres .",
    "our numerical results indeed verify the analytic results presented earlier in this paper .",
    "moreover , we find that even in the paramagnetic case , @xmath174 is small due to near electron - hole compensation , and also has a weak dependence on @xmath14 for the same reason . as a consequence , @xmath174",
    "is primarily determined by the  reservoir \" , which stays essentially unchanged as the magnetic order sets in . indeed , as we mentioned above , the dominant contribution to @xmath173 plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : numeric](b ) comes from the @xmath170 ellipsoids .    as a consequence",
    ", we find the deviation of the hall number to be linear in @xmath14 as well , in agreement with the analytic results .",
    "moreover , the near constancy of @xmath175 implies that the hall number should scale with the square of the longitudinal conductivity , a point discussed in our previous paper @xcite .",
    "we have also checked the dependence of @xmath176 on the variation * q * of the ordering wave vector * q * , and found it to be of order * q*@xmath177 , thus a higher order effect .",
    "we note that * q * itself was chosen so as to yield the maximum in the susceptibility ( that is , optimal nesting ) , the latter calculated using the same linear tetrahedron method employed in the transport calculations .",
    "in addition , the occupation number change with @xmath14 is small , meaning the chemical potential variation with @xmath14 is also a higher order effect .",
    "therefore , the linear variation of @xmath176 and @xmath178 with @xmath14 we find both numerically and analytically appears to be a robust result .",
    "in conclusion , we have analytically estimated the longitudinal and the hall conductivities for a spin density wave metal .",
    "our conclusions are two - fold .",
    "first , we find that , under generic circumstances , these transport coefficients depend linearly on the sdw energy gap in the small gap limit .",
    "these results have been confirmed by numerical calculations using the actual fermi surface of chromium .",
    "second , we showed that the behavior of the hall conductivity @xmath173 is special in the case of v - doped cr in that the change @xmath179 upon magnetic ordering is small .",
    "this is due to the fact that the nested regions of the hole and electron surfaces which are removed by magnetic ordering give contributions which are approximately equal in magnitude but opposite in sign , as revealed by detailed numerical calculations based on the actual fermi surface .",
    "the effect of this electron - hole compensation is particularly obvious within the rice model , where the critical mismatch of the electron and the hole surfaces is a small number of order @xmath180 , @xmath181 being the value of the energy gap for perfect nesting , and @xmath182 being the fermi energy .",
    "hence , the total hall conductivity of the two bands , and its change upon the gap opening , is reduced by a factor of order @xmath180 compared with the contribution of each band . in both the case of the rice model , and the true fermi surface of chromium , the value of @xmath174 itself is largely set by the electron reservoir , i.e. by electrons that are unaffected by the magnetism . as a consequence ,",
    "@xmath173 is nearly constant over a wide parameter range across the quantum critical point .",
    "we now make a brief comparison with the experiments @xcite . the latest pressure results in v - doped cr",
    "@xcite have provided access to the behavior in the immediate vicinity of the quantum critical point .",
    "the hall coefficient was found to have a square root dependence on pressure : @xmath183 .",
    "the nel temperature also has the same dependence and , since within mean field theory , @xmath14 is proportional to @xmath184 , we conclude that @xmath185 as well .",
    "thus @xmath178 indeed depends linearly on @xmath14 , as we found theoretically .",
    "experiment also finds that the hall conductivity @xmath173 is unchanged across the quantum critical point , and that @xmath186 scales with @xmath187 , as we also expect .",
    "however , the longitudinal resistivity was found to vary as @xmath188.@xcite this is different from our theoretical prediction @xmath189 and seems to be at variance with the claim that @xmath190 .",
    "we believe this is connected with the difficulty of extracting critical exponents in the presence of sample inhomogeneity , though we can not exclude the possibility of new physics beyond the mean - field picture .    the overall success of the nested sdw picture for understanding the @xmath191 data in vanadium - doped chromium shows that the hall effect is indeed a good measure of fermi surface evolution across a quantum critical point .",
    "our conclusion is not only important for simple metals such as chromium , but also serves as a benchmark for the understanding of the hall effect in more complex systems such as heavy fermion metals @xcite and high @xmath192 cuprates @xcite .",
    "finally , we should stress that our theory only applies at zero temperature , and does not address the strong temperature dependence of the hall conductivity observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "we leave these interesting challenges for future theoretical studies",

    "since the integral in ( [ eq : sigmaintegral ] ) is taken over the modified fermi surface , we first have to evaluate expression ( [ eq : appendix_v ] ) at the new fs .",

    "up to a constant factor @xmath228 one gets : @xmath229 notice that this integral does not converge near @xmath230 .",
    "this only means that our approximation ( [ eq : linear_e12 ] ) does not allow us to calculate the total value of @xmath67 , since it is accurate only in the vicinity of the crossing point @xmath121 .",

    "this indeed happens in the case considered in ref .   and",
    "was discussed in the body of the paper at the end of sec .",
    "[ sec : linear_conductivity_touching_spheres ] .",
    "in the rice model with different fermi surfaces , such a cancellation does not happen .    for the other components of the conductivity , we merely need to use the corresponding velocity projections in ( [ eq : sigmaintegral ] ) .",
    "an additional complication here is the @xmath210-dependence in ( [ eq : v_components ] ) , but it only gives a factor of @xmath236 : @xmath237 the conclusion for the crossing case is that @xmath238      in the case of a linear sdw , each sheet of the fs interacts with the other one shifted both by @xmath239 and @xmath240 . for an incommensurate @xmath18 ,",
    "this leads to an infinite secular matrix which has to be solved .",
    "on the other hand , for fermi surface restricted integrals , we can formulate a good approximation which avoids this difficulty .",
    "for the rice model in the incommensurate case , for instance , it never happens that the copies of the hole fermi surface shifted by @xmath239 and @xmath240 are both close to the same point of the electron fermi surface .",
    "this property considerably simplifies the calculation , because it allows us to consider the hole fs shifted only by @xmath239 .",
    "indeed , the electron fermi surface can be divided into three parts : ( i ) the one which disappears due to interaction with the hole fermi surface shifted by @xmath239 , ( ii ) the one which disappears due to the interaction with the other hole surface shifted by @xmath240 , and ( iii ) the one which survives .",
    "any kinetic coefficient will be given by part iii .",
    "at the same time , when only one of the shifted surfaces is considered , it is given by a sum of parts ii and iii for @xmath239 , and parts i and iii for @xmath240 .",
    "since the paramagnetic value is a sum of the contributions from i , ii , and iii , it follows that the linear sdw leads to coefficients which are equal to the sum of the values for the @xmath239 and the @xmath240 cases minus the paramagnetic value .",
    "therefore , the change of the kinetic coefficients is twice the result obtained in the calculation with the hole surface shifted by only @xmath239 , since the @xmath239 and @xmath240 contributions are equal by inversion symmetry .",
    "a similar argument can be applied to the flat fermi surface model of shibatani _ et al _ @xcite , as well as to the actual fermi surface of cr . in section",
