    "a main characteristic of granular media is that their behavior varies between being more fluid- and being more solid - like .",
    "initializing flow via shaking or stirring fluidizes granular baths . that has been observed in various experiments and simulations , in particular by verifying archimedes law , @xcite .",
    "also phenomenological arguments have been added to the understanding of the buoyancy force in granular media , e.g. from using the enskog hydrodynamic equations  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless numerous controversies have remained and various corrections must be considered . in the present paper",
    "we take up a simple excluded volume model to study the origin and the corrections to archimedes law around the fluid limit .",
    "+ fluid - like behavior of a granular material should obviously include hydrostatic and hydrodynamic effects . a natural way to study",
    "the origin of granular hydrostatics and their possible corrections is via flow induction , i.e. , stirring or shaking the system . that causes energy transfer to the grains which is dissipated again in the collisions between the moving grains .",
    "further simplifications can help to understand the essence of what happens . in that spirit",
    "we consider the asymmetric exclusion process to simulate the dynamics of the grains ( monomers ) with one large particle ( rod ) immersed in them .",
    "the condition of detailed balance enables us to identify the buoyancy force on the rod , as function of its size and of its relative weight , and locally as function of the height.we recover archimedes law in the fluid limit , and we create a theoretical framework for a detailed study of possible corrections .",
    "corrections arise from various effects such as from the discrete nature of the lattice where the lattice spacing measures the size of the grains .",
    "corrections also arise from thermal effects especially when the grains are themselves immersed in a heat bath ( e.g. hot air ) , and as studied here , from finite shaking rates .",
    "other possible corrections arise from convection currents in the granular medium , to which we turn briefly in section [ rema ] .",
    "+ to the extent that our modeling via the asymmetric exclusion process is relevant for the experimental conditions of granular media under shaking , archimedes - like behavior was already predicted in @xcite .",
    "five years later archimedes law was confirmed experimentally @xcite in a granular medium , and some corrections were explored before the fluid limit . in the mean time",
    "further experimental work and simulations which show an explicit archimedes like behavior have been added , including @xcite .",
    "we come back to the basic set - up .",
    "+      the experiment @xcite consists of a bi - dispersion of glass beads which form the granular bath .",
    "this bath is placed in a rectangular box , on which horizontal shaking is applied through vibrations on the walls .",
    "gravity controls the vertical motion .",
    "the bath fluidizes for larger energy input through the external shaking .",
    "the energy of shaking is quantified by a dimensionless quantity @xmath0 related to frequency @xmath1 and amplitude @xmath2 of shaking which in the case of horizontal shaking exercise a similar effect .",
    "one observes a clear transition ; before some energy threshold is reached the state is mostly solid and there is a clear boundary where the unfluid state becomes fluidized and the principle of archimedes is obeyed henceforth .",
    "the correction to archimedes law can be described by a drag force .",
    "several experiments have studied the behavior of this drag force @xcite .",
    "most agree that in the fluidized and low density limit the drag force is observed to be proportional to the velocity .",
    "moreover the coefficient of viscosity is seen to vary exponentially with the shaking amplitude @xcite , or , in @xcite , observed inversely proportional to the shaking amplitude . for denser media",
    "the drag force was seen to be varying logarithmic with velocity @xcite . in our model",
    "we discuss the nature of drag force and corrections to it in section [ gmasmall ] .",
    "the goal of this paper is to give a simple theoretical model giving a natural interpretation of these experimental results , and at the same time to allow further studies on modifications of archimedes principle under the influence of fluctuations and nonequilibrium effects . on a more fundamental level ,",
    "our model illustrates the construction of statistical forces .",
    "we have here an example of how the effective motion of the bigger particle gets changed indirectly by the influence of that same particle on the smaller particles .",
    "in other words , the rod ( bigger particle ) is active in changing its environment .",
    "the result can be characterized as an additional effect modifying archimedes buoyancy before the fluid limit .",
    "the granular medium that is considered are particle conserving lattice gases that evolve under excluded volume conditions .",
    "the configuration is completely determined by the particle occupations ( there are no velocities ) but the dynamics is dissipative and therefore simulates to some extent the behavior of low density granular materials .",
    "+ the plan of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe our model , introduced in @xcite which is an exclusion process of walkers on a regular lattice in the presence of a spatially extended object . in section [ fluidlimit ] the fluid limit yields archimedes law in terms of a conservative buoyancy force proportional to the local fluid density times the volume of the object .",
    "further the continuum limit to the spatial degree of freedom reveals the first level of corrections to the nature of buoyancy force .",
    "fluctuations due to the surrounding heat bath bring in the next level of correction to the usual hydrostatic formulation .",
    "+ the main result appears in section [ redgreen ] where we investigate corrections to the fluid limit .",
    "we map our model to a simpler one - dimensional problem , to obtain the motion of a random walker in a stochastic dynamical environment . there ,",
    "the correction to archimedes law is explained by a memory effect which acts as friction on a rising object .",
    "continuum corrections bring additional clarification .",
    "we discuss how our model adds a simple heuristic picture to the experimental observations of @xcite .",
    "the last sections discuss additional aspects that become visible through our theoretical modeling . a discussion on the existing mechanisms of intruder dynamics in granular media and a comparison with our model appears in section [ rema ] . in section [ rema1 ] results of simulations modeling our system are shown .",
    "future possibilities of nonequilibrium effects and collective behavior are alluded upon in the last sections .",
    "we consider a stochastic dynamics for the motion of a rod in a lattice fluid composed of monomers .",
    "the model was introduced in @xcite , obtaining a markovian reduced dynamics for the rod motion in the limit where between any two moves of the rod , the monomer configuration has the time to relax . that can be interpreted as the fluid limit in which the rod always `` sees '' the fluid of monomers in equilibrium .",
    "all motion takes place on the square lattice @xmath3 where the mesh size , taken unity here , gives the size of the grains .",
    "these grains ( also called , monomers ) can occupy sites @xmath4 having `` vertical '' coordinate @xmath5 and `` horizontal '' coordinate @xmath6 .",
    "there can be at most one grain per site .",
    "there is one big particle or big grain , called rod and we only follow its vertical position . the vertical position of the rod at time @xmath7 is denoted by @xmath8 taking values in @xmath9 .",
    "the rod occupies @xmath10 lattice sites in the horizontal direction , i.e. , the region @xmath11 is forbidden for the monomers when @xmath12 .",
    "+ the horizontal jumps of the monomers are symmetric at rate @xmath13 . increasing the rate @xmath13 speeds up the monomer dynamics in the horizontal direction ( orthogonal to the motion of the rod ) .",
    "the vertical jumps of the monomers and the rod are asymmetric ; modeling a gravitational field .",
    "note that the vertical motion is not speeded up , but of course it is influenced by @xmath13 as well .",
    "+ more formally , the microscopic dynamics looks as follows ; see fig .  1 :",
    "the monomer configuration is denoted by @xmath14 ; @xmath15 means there is no monomer at site @xmath16 at time @xmath7 and @xmath17 if there is a monomer at site @xmath16 at time @xmath7 .",
    "the dynamics is of exclusion  type because all motion is via jumping to vacant sites , and rod and monomers never overlap",
    ". a monomer moves horizontally to a vacant nearest neighbor site , symmetrically with rate @xmath13 .",
    "it moves vertically up with rate @xmath18 and down with rate @xmath19 .",
    "the rod only moves vertically , up with rate @xmath20 and down with rate @xmath21 .",
    "we choose @xmath22 to represent the gravitational field , e.g. via @xmath23 , where @xmath24 denote the mass of the rod , respectively of the monomers ; @xmath25 is a typical unit of thermal energy at temperature @xmath26 which plays little role in what follows , except for allowing fluctuations .",
    "the temperature could also refer to an additional heat bath that makes contact with the grains . yet",
    ", granular media are typically a - thermal in which case we think of @xmath27 . the lattice unit is not indicated ; it is taken to be one and should be thought of as the size of the grains .",
    "all that motion gets summarized in the formal generator @xmath28 [ f(\\eta , y+1 ) - f(\\eta , y)]\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\ ; b\\ , i[\\eta(i)=0 , \\forall i \\in a_n(y-1)]\\ , [ f(\\eta , y-1 ) - f(\\eta , y ) ] + \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\sum_{i=(i_1,i_2 ) } \\bigl\\{p\\ , \\eta(i)\\ , ( 1-\\eta(i_1,i_2 + 1))\\ , i[(i_1,i_2 + 1 ) \\notin a_n(y)]\\,\\times[f(\\eta^{i,(i_1,i_2 + 1)},y ) - f(\\eta , y ) ] \\nonumber\\\\ & + & q\\ , \\eta(i)\\ , ( 1-\\eta(i_1,i_2 - 1))\\ , i[(i_1,i_2 - 1 ) \\notin a_n(y)]\\times[f(\\eta^{i,(i_1,i_2 - 1)},y ) - f(\\eta , y)]\\bigr\\ } \\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\gamma \\sum_{\\langle ij\\rangle : i_2=j_2 } i[\\langle ij \\rangle \\cap a_n(y ) = \\emptyset ] [ f(\\eta^{i , j},y ) - f(\\eta , y)]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 $ ] is the indicator function of the event in the brackets , giving one or zero depending on the event being realized , and @xmath30 is the grain configuration @xmath31 after switching the occupations in sites @xmath16 and @xmath32 . the last term represents the horizontal shaking in which the occupations of ( horizontal ) nearest neighbor pairs @xmath33 get exchanged .",
    "observe that there is always both horizontal and vertical motion , subject to the exclusion rule , which , besides from the shaking , can arise from an extra heat bath in which the grains are moving and with which energy can be exchanged .",
    "+ we need for writing down the kinetic equations that are all of the form @xmath34 here and from now on , brackets @xmath35 are with respect to the stochastic dynamics and over the following initial conditions . at starting time @xmath36 we put @xmath37 so that the rod starts from the center of the lattice , but that is really arbitrary . for the initial distribution on monomer occupations",
    "we take density @xmath38 for parameter @xmath39 .",
    "this formula satisfies @xmath40 which is a detailed balance relation for the motion of the grains , see also below .",
    "the density varies between zero ( at the top ) to one ( at the bottom ) .",
    "the height where @xmath41 scales like @xmath42 .",
    "the derivative of the density at that height ( where the transition is made between higher and lower density ) is proportional to @xmath43 .",

    "low density granular media under heavy shaking would also fall in that category which in our modeling is most typical .",
    "the density is constant in the horizontal direction ( @xmath6 ) , but always conditioned on having @xmath47 for all @xmath16 covered by the rod , i.e. , for all @xmath48 .",
    "+ more precisely , we let @xmath49 denote the product measure on @xmath50 with density @xmath51 = d(y)\\ ] ] defined by ( [ dens ] ) .",
    "the conditional probability @xmath52 is then the initial distribution on the monomers .",
    "the dynamics such as defined above gives rise to the markov process @xmath53 .",
    "+      in the limit @xmath54 the motion of the rod decouples from the monomer dynamics .",

    "the factors @xmath59^n$ ] of course express the plausibility of having space for the rod to move from height @xmath5 to @xmath60 ; there must be a hole of size @xmath61 .",

    "+ the above analysis concludes that the two  dimensional lattice model on a lattice with a simple exclusion dynamics , provides a reasonable description of the hydrostatic behavior of granular matter in the limiting ( fluidized ) case .",
    "we have seen above how the discreteness of the vertical lattice - direction makes a first correction , easily studied for small lattice mesh .",
    "a second type of correction is due to fluctuations .",
    "the rod dynamics generated by is stochastic .",
    "the fluctuations of the rod about its equilibrium position can be studied in the large @xmath61 limit with standard deviation around the mean going as @xmath94 . for the third major type of correction , we study the approach to the fluid limit .",
    "the next section is devoted to these questions .",
    "to this end we propose a contracted description of the model , coarse - graining it to an effective one - dimensional model ; see fig .  2 .",
    "the idea is as follows .",
    "the essential aspect of the monomer dynamics as far as regards the rod , is whether there is a hole above or below the rod in which it can jump .",
    "we therefore summarize all of the monomer configuration @xmath95 by variables @xmath96 , that specify whether or not there is a monomer in the region @xmath97 , see : @xmath98 more precisely , there is a hole at @xmath5 if @xmath47 for all @xmath99 .",
    "the position of the rod is still denoted by @xmath100 .",
    "we assume as major simplification that the ( contracted ) system @xmath101 , undergoes a joint markov process which mimics the original model in the following sense .",

    "3 .        so formally",

    "could the region occupied by the rod be simultaneously occupied by a monomer and vice versa , so @xmath119 always .",
    "this is the influence of the active particle ( the rod ) on the fast degrees of freedom .",
    "obviously , the rates @xmath120 must be interpreted in terms of the monomer density @xmath74 at @xmath5 with their dependence on the size @xmath61 of the rod and on the amount of horizontal shaking @xmath13 .",
    "comparing with suggests further interpretations .",
    "+ it remains that @xmath121 where @xmath79 is the mass of the rod .",
    "we can think of the monomers as blinking lights , red ( @xmath106 ) for no passage of the rod , and green ( @xmath122 ) for passage allowed . in the original two - dimensional model a hole ( green light ) @xmath122 at @xmath5 represents the fact that there are no monomers at the sites @xmath123 , and ( red light ) @xmath106 means that some monomer can be found in the region @xmath97 .",
    "abbreviating @xmath124 we take therefore @xmath125 for the rate at which a hole gets removed , respectively created .",
    "each depend on @xmath61 and on @xmath5 but observe that @xmath126 which is the horizontal shaking rate .",
    "the stationary hole density at @xmath5 for that two - state markov process becomes @xmath127 which is the correct hole probability in the original monomer - model , cf . .",
    "of course the weight of the monomer is represented in the density @xmath74 via . + here also ,",
    "for our simplified model we can take the fluid limit @xmath64 . by simpler arguments",
    "than in @xcite , the motion of @xmath8 decouples from that of the @xmath128 and by our choice we find exactly the same limiting motion of the rod as given in .",
    "the two models mathematically agree in the fluid model but our second model allows more easily to find the most significant contribution before the fluid limit , to which we turn next .",
    "suppose we find the rod at time @xmath129 in position @xmath5 .",
    "thus , at that time the hole probability at @xmath5 is equal to 1 . when the rod jumps from position @xmath5 to say position @xmath102 at time @xmath129 it leaves a `` hole '' at position @xmath5 which remains a hole until it gets occupied by either monomers or by the rod again .",
    "in the fluid limit the monomer dynamics is fast enough and they relax to their equilibrium configuration so that at its next jump the rod sees a hole with probability @xmath130 .",
    "on the other hand if the time of monomer relaxation is longer in comparison to the rod , at the next jump at time @xmath131 the rod sees `` no hole '' with probability @xmath132 as follows from a simple calculation for the two - state markov process @xmath107 .",
    "note however that the transient density is lower than @xmath133 and that is only valid under the condition that the rod has not ( re-)entered position @xmath5 during @xmath134 $ ] .",
    "it implies that at time @xmath131 the rod still sees the hole it left behind at @xmath5 .",

    "the faster a tracer particle moves in a thermal bath the more traffic it finds ahead of itself than behind .",
    "of course friction appears in all directions against motion and exists at shaking of all strengths .",
    "the drag force we see here is a variation of this effect .",
    "our system is overdamped and nothing of impact or momentum transfer can be discussed ; yet interaction via excluded volume will be sufficient to generate ( another ) force which opposes motion of the rod .",
    "this force appears when granular baths are not completely fluidized .",
    "the higher the intruder dynamics rate , the stronger its memory of its previous position and the greater is the chance of jumping to its old position .",
    "the force become weaker and weaker in the fluid limit since the memory of the rod is `` instantaneously '' being wiped away by the monomers .",
    "we believe that the `` drag force '' dependence on @xmath13 and intruder velocity as seen in @xcite away from the fluid limit are explained by this new kind of opposing force rather than the conventional understanding of friction in fluids , especially in a low density environment where momentum transfer does not play such a big role .",
    "effects of buoyancy in granular media have been widely studied both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "it is not always easy to distinguish between anti - gravity effects and buoyancy as in archimedes law .",
    "that connects with the variety of segregation effects in granular media upon shaking them .",
    "reference @xcite discusses various mechanisms that can work together for the segregation of grains .",
    "+ buoyancy , i.e. , rising / sinking due to pressure gradients , dominates when the fluidization occurs with no convection .",
    "our model does not show boundary effects and inertia is absent .",
    "the limiting motion is overdamped in the diffusion limit .",
    "+ buoyancy is indeed most visible in a vibro - fluidized regime , where only binary collisions are prevalent and there is no long time contact between particles .",
    "the medium must have minimal convection , so the boundaries must be far and the interactions with the boundary reduced . in a fluidized regime",
    "the effects due to convection as well as inertia are reduced enough for buoyancy to be visible , @xcite . in the unfluidized regime ,",
    "effects like inertia , void filling models ( true for vertical shaking ) and convection are more important .",
    "another difference to be noted is that buoyancy is not just a phenomenon of the larger particle climbing up to the top of the pile but refers to a specific dependence of height on the relative sizes and densities .",
    "+ on the other hand , the rising of larger objects in a sea of smaller grains due to the brazil nut effect , @xcite , arises in several forms and many competing mechanisms influence the motion of the larger particles within a bath ( shape , size , forces between particles , shaking amplitude and direction , interstitial air and humidity ) . in @xcite a similar model to ours was used to investigate the brazil nut effect .",
    "sometimes segregation is a result of entropic forces which are strong in a gravity free regime and when the frictional forces among bath particles and between bath and intruder are such that the entropy of a segregated state is higher than a highly mixed state , @xcite .",
    "since the one - dimensional reduction of the full lattice fluid model has undergone some further simplifications , we have tested numerically whether our approximations appear reasonable . in other words , we have compared the trajectories of the rod in our approximations with those of the true model .",
    "the simulation was run on a chain of 300 sites and gravity @xmath135 and @xmath25 are taken as unity . in this way we could also numerically verify archimedes law in the large @xmath13 limit . in the fluid limit",
    "the buoyancy force varies linearly with the size @xmath61 of the rod , see fig .",
    "the straight line indicates that for such a large @xmath13 the monomer bath is fluid - like . for a given height @xmath5 buoyancy force",
    "is calculated by estimating the weight of the rod which would exactly balance the force from the bath at that height . in the fluid limit at equilibrium",
    "then , the weight of the rod is equal to the upward force(called buoyancy ) .",
    "before the fluid limit is reached buoyancy force varies with @xmath13 ; for large @xmath13 the buoyancy force tends to a steady value as given by archimedes law , see fig .",
    "5 . that must be compared with fig.3 in @xcite .",
    "the buoyancy force grows with @xmath13 and after a certain critical value which in the simulation was @xmath185 , it saturates .",
    "5 shows the archimedes force corrected with the friction term as it acts in , with the @xmath186 kind of variation .      instead of considering memory only until one time step before , one could also take two , three or more time steps long memory",
    "that means , to consider again and to take into account contributions from alternative histories .",
    "these contributions are all of smaller order , with each correction falling as an inverse power of @xmath13 .",
    "the power arises from performing the integral like in but now the time is a sum of exponential variables , so that we get corrections like @xmath187 .",
    "another type of correction to archimedes law comes from the possible nonequilibrium nature of the medium , even in the fluid limit . indeed , an essential aspect of our analysis above was that the sea of grains ( monomers ) reach their equilibrium between two moves of the rod ( in the fluid limit ) , and that equilibrium is the same with or without the rod .",
    "in other words , the stationary distribution of the constrained dynamics of the monomers given the rod s position gives exactly the same as conditioning the stationary distribution of the joint monomer ",
    "rod dynamics on the position of the rod .",
    "that is only valid under the condition of detailed balance , see e.g. lemma 3.1 in @xcite . in the present paper detailed balance",
    "is forced by the specific choice of density profile for which holds that @xmath188 in the small mesh ( continuum ) limit this detailed balance condition becomes @xmath189 as repeatedly used in the derivation of the langevin equations and , and in the validity of the corresponding einstein relation . when detailed balance is violated and the granular sea shows an irreversible steady behavior , the motion remains much less understood .",
    "a final source of corrections to archimedes law is due to the interaction with other intruders ( rods ) .",
    "here we are really speaking about a whole new range of phenomena in which pairing of particles , @xcite and more general collective effects as flocking @xcite , can occur .",
    "the main underlying reason however is already visible from the simple analysis of the present paper .",
    "the excluded volume effect of one rod not only creates a bias for itself to return to the place it was before ( creating drag , @xcite ) , but also creates space where another intruder can hop into , and thus `` attracts '' other rods and intruders .",
    "this granular - hydrodynamic interaction is long range and is expected to be proportional to the speeds of the rods , but more exploration is needed .",
    "this interaction qualitatively resembles the long range hydrodynamic interaction between colloidal particles in suspensions .",
    "these interactions come through due to the stokes - like force applied by the suspension on a moving colloid which results in long - range interaction between two colloids connected through the oseen tensor . here , the collective behavior of multiple intruders results from simple exclusion and memory tracks left on the bath .",
    "there are few `` mesoscopic '' toy - models of granular effects , and there is a wealth of experimental data .",
    "we have presented a theoretical model comprised of a large bath of small particles and the motion of a large body through this bath .",
    "we only consider positional degrees of freedom with a dissipative dynamics .",
    "fluidization is controlled by the degree @xmath13 of horizontal shaking ; it modifies the relaxation time of the bath degrees of freedom .",
    "the fast and the slow degrees of freedom get separated and the extended body undergoes buoyancy according to archimedes law .",
    "corrections before the fluid limit can be modeled in terms of memory effects , where the big particle is biased to fall back in the hole it left behind .",
    "this creates friction proportional to the velocity with a coefficient that is inversely proportional to the shaking amplitude + granular medium is fertile ground for study of origin and behavior of statistical forces which arise due to coarse - graining .",
    "two of those are studied here , buoyancy due to the pressure gradients and additional memory effects creating friction . as an outlook , the study of effective forces and interactions out - of - equilibrium remains very much open .",
