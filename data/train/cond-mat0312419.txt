    "since the discovery by evans.et.al.@xcite , fluctuation theorem(ft ) has been studied in many situations , both stochastic@xcite,@xcite,@xcite and deterministic@xcite@xcite , though systems and interpretations differ , ft has a universal form : @xmath0 here , @xmath1 is the entropy generated , and @xmath2 is the probability for @xmath3 .",
    "it is interesting that ft kind relation universally holds , but its direct experimental application is not known.(though jarzynski equality@xcite is closely related to ft and has been used in the experiment , this equality is not ft itself , in this sense application of jarzynsky equality is not direct . )",
    "so , we would like to derive ft for rachet system , because it relates biological physics , and direct application of ft is expected .",
    "the analysis is based on langevin treatment .",
    "kurchan showed that for langevin system , if the initial state is gibbsian , ft holds generally@xcite .",
    "though we consider langevin treatment , the result does not depend on the initial condition and in this sense our interest is different from that of kurchan .",
    "in this paper we consider the rachet system , namely a particle on a periodic potential @xmath4 is dragged by a constant load force @xmath5 .",
    "then , the effective potential the particle feels is @xmath6 .",
    "if , the potential barrier is high enough , the particle can be considerd to be almost at equilibrium and may satisfy the detailed balance relation . indeed , the quantitative argument is given in the review by reimann@xcite .",
    "we summarize the work by reimann .",
    "we consider a system that a particle on a periodic potential(period @xmath7 ) is dragged by a constant load force @xmath5 .",
    "the motion of this particle can be described by the langevin eq .",
    ": @xmath8 the corresponding fokker - planck equation becomes :    @xmath9    here , @xmath10 is the probability current . then at a steady state ,",
    "the reduced probability current : @xmath11 becomes : @xmath12 if in each period @xmath7 there exists one minimum @xmath13 and one maximum @xmath14 , and the system is in the weak noise regime @xmath15 , the saddle point approximation gives the following probability current : @xmath16 here , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the kramers escape rate , the probability per unit time for a particle near a potential minimum escape to the right minimum and left minimum respectively . these @xmath17 and",
    "@xmath18 satisfy the detaled balance relation . @xmath19",
    "because of the assumption @xmath20 , we can describe the motion of a particle in terms of biased random walk .",
    "namely , it is sufficient to observe only the local minmum of effective potential and on what minimum the particle ( approximately ) exists at each discrete time @xmath21 .",
    "it is natural to assume that a particle hops only to the nearest - neighbor local minima : to the right minimum with probability @xmath17 , to the left minimum with @xmath18 , and it does not move with probability @xmath22 .",
    "then the motion of a particle follows the biased random walk .",
    "a particle hops to right , left , and remains with probabilities @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath22 .",
    "next we consider the probability @xmath23 which is the probability that after n unit time , particle moves k toward right . here",
    ", we can show the equation : @xmath24    one can prove this equation via following one to one correspondence .",
    ": consider any process that causes the movement k after n unit time .",
    "the process is constituted by movements : @xmath25 times toward right , @xmath26 times toward left , and @xmath27 times remaining .",
    "this process occurs with probability @xmath28 the corresponding opposite process : @xmath26 times toward right , @xmath25 times toward left , and @xmath27 times remaining .",
    "this process occurs with probability @xmath29 so , the ratio of the probability that these two opposite processes occurs is @xmath30 .",
    "this is valid for any @xmath26 , and the equation is derived .",
    "then we substitute the detaled balance relation for kramers escape rate @xmath31 into the above equation , we obtain following expression : @xmath32 we define the entropy generated @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the joule heat .",
    "@xmath1 can be considered as the entropy generated , since the work done on the system extenally will be entirely dissipated , and there are no contribution to the internal energy . finally , we take the continuous limit , @xmath35 , we obtain the steady state fluctuation theorem : @xmath36",
    "ft for rachet system is derived .",
    "ft derived here is applicable to any system which obeys a biased random walk and satisfies the detailed balance relation .",
    "especially , a complete example was recently given by nishiyama.et.al@xcite .",
    "they performed an experiment where a single kinesin externally forced moves along a microtuble obeying a biased random walk with regular @xmath37 steps . and they measured the ratio of the forward to backward movements at each load force @xmath38 , the result well agrees with the detailed balance relation .",
    "ft derived in this letter would therefore valid for this system .    because the derivation of ft consists of two parts , identity ( [ ratio ] ) and detailed balance relation , there is the possibility that under some condition detailed balance does not hold and ft should be modified .",
    "this modification of ft is an open problem .",
    "the author is grateful to professor p.gaspard , and professor s.tasaki for fruitful discussions ."
