    "the formation and evolution histories of the galaxies that populate rare , rich clusters are currently unknown ; however , it seems unlikely that a single history can accurately describe the whole population ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the giant elliptical galaxies which dominate the central regions of rich clusters seem to have been in place for well over 5 gyr , and have only evolved passively since ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the remainder of the population is dominated in numbers by dwarf spheroidal galaxies and in mass by early type galaxies ( e , s0 , early spirals ) .",
    "there is strong theoretical ( e.g. , @xcite ) and observational ( e.g. , @xcite ) evidence that much of the cluster galaxy population has been built up by the accretion of galaxies from the surrounding , low density , field environment , which implies that the rich cluster environment has affected a morphological change in these galaxies . a clear correlation between galaxy morphology with local density ( @xcite ) and cluster  centric radius ( @xcite ) has been observed .",
    "the well  known lack of emission line galaxies in clusters ( @xcite ) has also been shown to correlate with cluster ",
    "centric radius ( balogh et al . 1997 ) and to be not entirely accounted for by the morphology  radius relation ( @xcite ) .",
    "recently , abraham et al . ( 1996 ) and morris et al . (",
    "1998 ) showed that these various effects could be interpreted as an `` age '' gradient , in the sense that galaxies farther from the cluster center formed part of their stellar component more recently than the central galaxies .",
    "another key piece of evidence that cluster galaxies are evolving strongly is the observation that the fraction of blue , spiral galaxies in clusters increases with redshift ( e.g. , @xcite , 1984 , @xcite , but see @xcite ) .",
    "this is usually referred to as the butcher  oemler ( b  o ) effect . to avoid possible misunderstanding",
    ", we will always refer to the b  o effect as this exclusively , a separate effect from the above problem of differential evolution between the cluster and field , though the two phenomena may be related .",
    "it has been shown that the star formation rate in the field also increases with redshift ( @xcite ) ; thus , the b  o effect as we consider it here may not be an exclusively cluster  specific effect and can not na@xmath16vely be used as an explanation of the different populations which inhabit cluster and field environments .",
    "furthermore , it is not clear that the b  o effect can be directly interpreted as an evolutionary effect ; kauffmann ( 1995 ) has shown that rich clusters at @xmath17 are not the direct progenitors of low redshift , comparably rich clusters .",
    "more recently , andreon & ettori ( 1999 ) have shown that the higher redshift butcher ",
    "oemler clusters have higher x  ray luminosities than their low redshift counterparts .",
    "since fair samples of clusters generally show either no evolution , or even _ negative _ evolution in the x  ray luminosity function ( e.g. , @xcite ) , this confirms that the high redshift butcher ",
    "oemler clusters may not be the evolutionary predecessors of the low redshift clusters .",
    "various mechanisms may be responsible for the transformation of a star  forming field galaxy to a passively evolving cluster member .",
    "an infalling galaxy which passes through or near the center of the cluster may have much of its gas content stripped by the hot intra  cluster medium ( icm ) , following which star formation will cease ( @xcite ) . if only gas in an extended , diffuse halo is stripped , star formation may be allowed to continue by consuming the remaining disk gas but , without infall to replenish this supply , star formation will die out on timescales of a few gyr ( @xcite ) .",
    "interaction with the icm near the virial radius , where the icm density is not high enough to completely strip the galaxy of its gas , may induce intense bursts of star formation ( @xcite ) which use up the remaining gas supply .",
    "such bursts may also be induced by interactions with nearby galaxies ( @xcite,1998 , @xcite ) or , near the cluster center , by interactions with the tidal field of the cluster ( @xcite ) .",
    "understanding the mechanisms responsible for this change in star formation history is necessary to appropriately correct the cnoc1 universal mass density estimate ( @xcite ) for the difference in mass  to  light ( m / l ) ratio in clusters , compared with the field .",
    "the correction applied in carlberg , yee & ellingson ( 1997 ) could be compromised if a large number of cluster galaxies underwent strong starbursts which do _ not _ occur in the field population .",
    "dressler & gunn ( 1983 ) identified a galaxy population which they later termed e+a galaxies , that have strong balmer lines but no detectable emission lines .",
    "these galaxies ( which we will hereafter term k+a to be consistent with current nomenclature ) appear to have recently terminated star formation , within the @xmath181 gyr prior to observation . as such",
    ", they play an important part in understanding the evolutionary history of galaxy populations .",
    "evidence for these ( and related ) galaxies have been found both locally ( @xcite ) and at moderate redshift ( e.g. , @xcite ) , in both cluster and field environments .",
    "many authors have interpreted the presence of these galaxies as evidence that a large percentage of cluster galaxies recently underwent strong starbursts ( e.g. , @xcite ) . however , it is still debatable whether or not starburst and post  starburst galaxies observed in clusters are unique to these environments . furthermore , other authors have claimed that most k+a galaxies can largely be explained as the result of truncated star formation , without a large , initial burst ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is necessary both to distinguish between these two scenarios , and to compare their relative importance in the cluster and field environments , to determine which physical processes are plausible explanations for the differential evolution of cluster and field galaxies , and to determine how these processes will affect the m / l ratio in these environments .",
    "the cnoc1 survey ( yee , ellingson & carlberg 1996 ) provides an excellent sample of galaxy spectra for which a reliable estimate of the star formation history for clusters at @xmath19 can be determined .",
    "this is a result of ( 1 ) a large sample size ( over 2000 spectra ) ; ( 2 ) well understood , and properly correctable , selection effects ; ( 3 ) an identically selected field galaxy sample over the same redshift range ; ( 4 ) objective measurements of spectral indices with well understood and empirically calibrated uncertainties ; and ( 5 ) consistent comparison between data and spectrophotometric models . from these data , we will attempt to specifically address the following questions .",
    "first , what fraction of galaxies in the cnoc1 sample , regardless of environment , had significant star formation truncated in the last billion years or so ? if this is truly larger than the low redshift fraction , it suggests a link with the b  o effect .",
    "secondly , how does the abundance of these galaxies in the field compare with the abundance in clusters ?",
    "an overabundance in clusters would suggest that the mechanism responsible for generating these galaxies may be what leads to the differential evolution of cluster and field galaxies .",
    "finally , _ how _ is the star formation in these galaxies truncated ?",
    "we will use spectrophotometric models to try to distinguish between a ) truncation following a short burst ; or , b ) abrupt truncation without a burst .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  [ sec - data ]",
    "we define our data sample and spectral index measurements .",
    "in particular , we discuss the details of our sample selection , statistical corrections , magnitude limits , and index uncertainties .",
    "interpretation of our line indices is made based on a comparison with pegase ( @xcite ) spectrophotometric models , described in  [ sec - models ] .",
    "our galaxy classification scheme is presented in  [ sec - defs ] , and is based on the line indices of local galaxies and results of the pegase models ( detailed in the appendix ) .",
    "we present our results in various forms in  [ sec - res ] , and take care to explore systematic effects which result from the large uncertainties on our line indices . in ",
    "[ sec - compare ] we compare our results with the work of zabludoff et al .",

    "( 1996 ) , dressler et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and others , and show that there is some consistency of results , though considerable variety in interpretation .",
    "we discuss some of the implications of these results in  [ sec - discuss ] , and summarize our findings in  [ sec - conc ] .",
    "the cnoc1 cluster sample consists of cfht mos images ( gunn @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) and spectra of galaxies in the fields of fifteen x  ray luminous clusters in the redshift range @xmath0 , selected from the emss survey ( @xcite ) .",
    "the observational strategy and full details of the survey can be found in yee et al .",
    "in particular , yee et al . carefully consider and detail the selection effects of this sample , and describe how these are corrected for .",
    "for convenience , we repeat here some of the details in that paper relevant to the present analysis .",
    "the spectra are obtained with the o300 grism in place , which results in a dispersion of 3.45  per pixel and covers the rest ",
    "frame wavelength range from ( approximately ) [ oii]@xmath123727  to the g  band ( @xmath22 ) in most galaxies .",
    "slits are 15 wide , which results in a spectral resolution of about 16.5  fwhm .",
    "images and spectra of galaxies in each cluster are obtained from either one , three or five mos fields mosaiced east  west or north  south , which provide non  uniform coverage as far out as 12 @xmath23 in projected distance for most clusters , where @xmath23 is the radius ( @xmath24 h@xmath25 mpc ) at which the mean interior mass density is equal to 200 times the critical density , and within which it is expected that the galaxies are in virial equilibrium ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . for @xmath26 , the cluster virial radius is equal to approximately 1.2@xmath23 .",
    "the final catalog contains redshifts for about 2500 galaxies , including field galaxies located in front of and behind each cluster .    in order to average over effects of non  sphericity , we will combine all fifteen clusters to produce a single sample , hereafter referred to as _ the cluster_. cluster membership is determined based on the observed radial velocity difference from the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) .",
    "we use the mass model of carlberg et al .",
    "( 1997 ) to determine the ( projected ) radial dependence of the cluster velocity dispersion , @xmath27 , from the average , measured dispersion , @xmath28 .",
    "in figure [ fig - velrrr ] we plot the galaxy velocities , normalized to @xmath28 , against their projected radius from the bcg , normalized to @xmath23 .",
    "the @xmath29 and @xmath30 contours of the mass model are shown as the solid and dashed lines , respectively .",
    "galaxies with normalized velocities less than 3@xmath27 are considered cluster members ( squares ) , while those with normalized velocities greater than 6@xmath27 comprise our field sample ( circles ) .",
    "the population with intermediate velocities is represented by the solid triangles , and are considered `` near  field '' .",
    "the extent of the vertical axis in this figure is limited for clarity ; hence only a small fraction of the total field population is displayed .",
    "the cluster population appears well separated from the field in this figure , and exhibits a rising velocity dispersion toward the cluster center",
    ". we will only include galaxies within 2@xmath23 in our cluster sample , as larger radii are much more sparsely sampled .    by extracting the spectra with standard iraf routines ,",
    "an error vector is created which includes poisson errors , read noise and sky subtraction uncertainties .",
    "this allows a good determination of both the signal  to  noise ( s / n ) ratio of the data , and also reliable errors on any measured quantities ( see  [ sec - indices ] ) .",
    "the s / n ratio is defined as the mean value of the flux per pixel divided by the error per pixel , in the wavelength range @xmath31@xmath32 .",
    "the resulting s / n distributions for the cluster and field samples are shown in figure [ fig - snr ] .",
    "the mode of the distribution is at s / n@xmath337 per pixel ( or 15 per resolution element ) , and 94% of spectra have s / n@xmath34",
    ".    the entire cnoc1 data sample , including the raw data and all measured quantities included in this paper , will soon be available from the canadian astronomy data centre ( http://cadcwww.hia.nrc.ca/ ) .",
    "all cosmologically dependent calculations in this paper are made assuming @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "the hubble constant is parameterized as usual by @xmath37 km s@xmath25 mpc@xmath25 .",
    "we will consider three spectral indices , tabulated in table [ tab - indices ] , which are automatically measured by an iraf _ imfort _ routine available from the first author on request .",
    "the break strength at 4000  ( d4000 ) is defined as the ratio of the flux in the red continuum to that in the blue continuum .",
    "we have chosen a much narrower definition of this break than the standard definition ( @xcite ) .",
    "there are two principal reasons for this .",
    "first , the uncertainty in the standard index value , assuming poisson noise , was found to be a poor representation of the difference between multiple measurements of the same galaxy ( this analysis is discussed further in  [ sec - error ] ) .",
    "reducing the width of the continuum definitions significantly improved this correspondence .",
    "secondly , the new index is much less sensitive to reddening effects , which may be important ( see  [ sec - variations ] ) .",
    "cccc d4000 & 38503950 &  & 40004100 [ oii]@xmath123727 & 36533713 & 37133741 & 37413801 @xmath38 & 40304082 & 40824122 & 41224170    there are considerable advantages in using d4000 instead of the available _ g - r _ color .",
    "most importantly , computing a rest frame color from the observed photometry requires calculating k  corrections from the very models we will be using to determine star formation histories and , thus , introduces a circular argument .",
    "furthermore , the galaxy spectra are obtained from slits which only sample the central regions of the galaxy , while the photometry represents the integrated light from the whole galaxy .",
    "thus , the photometric colors and observed spectral features may not arise from the same environments .",
    "( however , at @xmath39 , the slit width of @xmath40 corresponds to a linear size of 4.4@xmath41 kpc , which is a sizable region ) .",
    "in addition , especially for our unusually narrow definition of d4000 , this index is very reddening insensitive .",
    "the principal disadvantage is that the measurement uncertainties in the d4000 measurements are generally larger than those of the _ g - r _ colors .",
    "the rest frame equivalent widths of the @xmath38 balmer absorption line , @xmath1 , and the [ oii]@xmath123727  emission line , @xmath2 , were automatically computed by summing the observed flux ( accounting for partial pixels ) above ( @xmath2 ) or below ( @xmath1 ) the continuum level , which itself is estimated by fitting a straight line to the flux in the continuum regions .",
    "the continuum data are weighted by the inverse square of the noise ( from the iraf noise vector ) , and the fit is then constructed by weighted linear regression . the blue and red continuum regions are defined in table [ tab - indices ] ; the line flux is summed over the region defined `` line '' in the same table . _",
    "note that the @xmath2  index is positive when the line is in emission , while the @xmath1  index is positive when the line is in absorption .",
    "_    it must be noted that the indices defined above ( or , indeed , any such indices ) are not necessarily related simply or directly to physical quantities .",
    "the value of the @xmath1  index is very sensitive to the line and continuum definitions , and also on the spectral resolution and sampling . in particular ,",
    "negative values of @xmath1  do not always indicate emission , since absorption lines in the continuum regions ( especially in galaxies with old stellar populations ) may result in negative @xmath1  index values .",
    "thus , caution must be taken when comparing these measurements with those of other authors ; in fact , the index definition here differs slightly from that used by our own collaboration in abraham et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .",
    "errors on the spectral indices are determined from the noise vector generated from the optimal iraf extraction .",
    "the d4000 index is simply a flux ratio and , hence , the error is determined from standard propagation techniques .",
    "errors on equivalent width measurements are computed from equation a8 in bohlin et al .",
    "( 1983 ) ; this makes use of the uncertainties of the weighted , linear continuum fit , and the uncertainties of each pixel defined as comprising the line itself . often , spectral regions contaminated by bright night sky line emission are very noisy , or interpolated over by hand .",
    "since the computed error vector reaches very large values at the wavelengths of night sky lines , this effect will be reflected in the index uncertainties . excluding from the sample all galaxies in which either of the lines at 5577  , 5890  , or 6300   lands within the index definitions of @xmath38 or [ ] does not significantly change our main results .",
    "since spectra were obtained with up to three masks for each cluster and , also , since adjacent fields overlap by about 15 , some galaxies were deliberately observed more than once .",
    "this allows us to test the reliability of our error estimate , by comparing the difference between two measurements ( @xmath42 ) with the quadrature sum of their errors , @xmath43 . in figure [ fig - ind_err ]",
    "we plot the distribution of the ratio of these two numbers , @xmath44 , for each of the three indices .",
    "if the true errors are gaussian distributed with a variance given by our error estimate , the distribution of @xmath45 should be gaussian with a mean of zero and variance of unity ; this is shown as the solid curve for reference .",
    "all of the @xmath45 distributions have a variance greater than 1 , and are inconsistent with the solid curves .",
    "this implies that our raw uncertainties are underestimated , which may reflect the small but inevitable systematic error resulting from the subtraction of incorrect sky levels in some cases .",
    "the 3@xmath11 clipped variance of each @xmath45 distribution is 1.44 for @xmath2 , 1.42 for @xmath1 and 1.96 for d4000 .",
    "the distributions are better represented by a gaussian of the corresponding , wider variance , shown as the dashed lines . to compensate for this effect , we multiplied all error estimates by the appropriate value .",
    "the final index value adopted for multiply observed galaxies is the average , weighted by the square of the error , of all independent measurements ( up to three ) .      in order to carry out our analysis ,",
    "statistical weights must be computed for all galaxies , to correct for the incompleteness of the spectroscopic sampling ; this procedure is reviewed in ",
    "[ sec - weights ] .",
    "we then proceed to define a luminosity  limited sample , in  [ sec - maglim ] , which will be considered for those analyses which are sensitive to such a limit . for the remainder of the analysis ,",
    "for which the primary purpose is to compare properties in the cluster and field samples , we define a larger sample which is not luminosity limited , but in which the lowest quality data are excluded , in ",
    "[ sec - maxsamp ] .",
    "unless otherwise specified , this latter is the data sample that will be discussed in the remainder of the paper .",
    "since spectra are not obtained for all of the galaxies observed photometrically , we must correct for this incompleteness and any selection effects that may arise as a result .",
    "these effects , and the calculation of compensating statistical weights , are considered in detail in yee et al .",
    "( 1996 ) ; we review them briefly here .",
    "the main selection criterion is apparent magnitude ; a smaller fraction of faint galaxies are observed spectroscopically , relative to brighter galaxies .",
    "the magnitude weight @xmath46 compensates for this effect .",
    "a second order , geometric weight @xmath47 is computed which compensates for such effects as the undersampling of denser regions , and vignetting near the corners of the chip .",
    "finally , a color weight @xmath48 is computed to account for the fact that bluer galaxies are more likely to show emission lines , facilitating redshift determination ; however , this is a small effect , and we have checked that the inclusion of this weight does not significantly affect any of the results discussed in the present paper .",
    "both @xmath47 and @xmath49 are normalized so that their mean is 1.0 for the full sample . in all of our statistical analysis , each galaxy in our sample",
    "is weighted by @xmath50 to statistically correct for these selection effects poisson statistics are computed from the unweighted number of galaxies under consideration . ] .",
    "we have also computed a `` ring '' weight , which is meant to correct for the fact that , due to the geometry of the cluster mosaics , the outer regions of clusters are less well sampled ( in area ) than the central regions .",
    "this correction is only important in the presence of radial gradients , if a globally averaged cluster quantity is sought .",
    "we will not use this weight in the present analysis , though we have verified that its use does not change any of the results ( recall that we restrict the cluster sample to those galaxies within @xmath51 ) .",
    "we will first define a sample limited only in luminosity .",
    "absolute @xmath21 magnitudes ( @xmath52 ) are calculated from the photometry , and k  corrections are made based on the _ g - r _ colors and the model spectral energy distributions of coleman , wu & weedman ( 1980 ) , convolved with the filter response function , for four , non  evolving spectral types ( e / s0 , sbc , scd and i m ) .",
    "we also correct @xmath52 for redshift evolution by assuming galaxies brighten by a factor ( 1+z ) ( @xcite ; @xcite ) ; thus , we correct all luminosities to the corresponding @xmath53 values by dividing them by ( 1+z ) , though this does not significantly affect our results .",
    "we chose an absolute magnitude limit of @xmath54 , since this excludes most of the galaxies with large magnitude weights , @xmath55 ; this limit corresponds to 1.8 mag below m@xmath56 in @xmath21 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the absolute magnitude distribution of the cluster sample ( weighted by @xmath57 ) is compared with that of the field in figure [ fig - mag_maglim ] .",
    "there are 1125 galaxies in this sample ( omitting the bcgs and cluster members beyond 2@xmath23 ) , including 710 cluster members , 343 field galaxies and 69 near field galaxies .",
    "the absolute magnitude distributions of the low ( @xmath58 ) and high ( @xmath59 ) redshift galaxies in this sample are shown in figure [ fig - magz ] . as a result of the fainter apparent magnitude limit in the high redshift cluster samples ( @xcite ) , and the luminosity evolution correction , the two distributions are comparable .      for the purposes of comparing cluster and field galaxy populations",
    ", it is desirable to use as much of the data as possible , excluding only that of the poorest quality , and ensuring that the luminosity distributions of the cluster and field samples remain similar . from the 1823 galaxies for which both [ oii]@xmath123727  and h@xmath3 lie within the observed redshift range ( excluding the bcgs and cluster members beyond 2@xmath23 ) , we first select the 1572 which have @xmath60 , so that the lowest quality data do not dominate our results ; this is equivalent to imposing a magnitude limit which varies from cluster to cluster .",
    "it is further desirable to remove those galaxies from the sample which have extraordinarily large uncertainties in the measured spectral indices , which often result from poor subtraction of bright night sky lines .",
    "the distribution of the error estimates for each index , scaled as discussed at the end of the previous subsection , are shown in figure [ fig - errordist ] .",
    "based on these distributions , we have chosen to exclude an additional 159 galaxies with errors greater than 15 , 5 , and 0.5 for @xmath2 , @xmath1  and d4000 , respectively .",
    "this selection introduces another second order correction to @xmath57 , as galaxies with index errors exceeding our limit tend to be fainter .",
    "we calculate , in bins of absolute luminosity , the fraction of galaxies , weighted by @xmath57 , removed from the sample by this selection .",
    "the remaining galaxies are weighted by the inverse of this number , which we will call @xmath61 , multiplied by @xmath57 .",
    "@xmath61 varies from 1 for galaxies with @xmath62 , to @xmath63 for galaxies with @xmath64 .",
    "the maximal sample consists of 1413 galaxies : 924 cluster , 407 field and 82 near field .",
    "the absolute magnitude distribution of the cluster sample ( weighted by @xmath65 ) is compared with that of the field in figure [ fig - mag_cf ] .",
    "although the two distributions are similar , the cluster sample is biased toward less luminous galaxies , and the weights do not sufficiently correct the spectroscopic numbers ( to be representative of the photometric sample ) below @xmath54 , due to the removal of galaxies with @xmath55 .      as discussed in ",
    "[ sec - indices ] , the @xmath1  index is sensitive to its definition and the manner in which it is measured .",
    "thus , its interpretation depends on comparing it with models in which the index is measured in an identical manner .",
    "it is not possible to use model results published by other authors ( e.g. , @xcite ) to interpret data unless it is shown that the indices defined for those models are comparable to those defined for the data . in light of this , we will reconstruct models in  [ sec - defs ] which have been explored by other authors , but based on our index definitions .",
    "the evolution of @xmath1  and d4000 with star formation history for solar metallicity galaxies is obtained from the pegase population synthesis code ( @xcite ) , based on their uv to nir spectral library .",
    "the pegase models predict results similar to those of the updated gissel96 models ( @xcite ) , but provide more freedom in constructing spectra with complex star formation histories ; in particular , different initial mass functions ( imfs ) are readily implemented .",
    "the drawback is that the models are solar metallicity ; to investigate metallicity effects , we will consider the gissel96 models .",
    "the standard imf adopted here is that of salpeter ( 1955 ) ; the effect of adopting a truncated imf model will be discussed in  [ sec - variations ] .",
    "spectral indices are determined from the model spectra in the same manner as from the cnoc1 data ; that is , the same code , with the same line definitions , are run on the spectra output by pegase .",
    "we have not included balmer  filling due to nebular emission ; thus , the model @xmath1  indices represent an upper limit on the equivalent width one expects to observe when massive stars are present .",
    "care was taken to ensure that the line indices we obtain from the models correspond to the line indices measured on the data ; in particular , the @xmath1  index is quite sensitive to both the resolution and the sampling of the spectra .",
    "the ( rest frame ) resolution of the model spectra is 10 , comparable to the resolution of our data ( about 15  at z=0.3 ) .",
    "however , the model spectra are more coarsely sampled than the cnoc1 data ( every 10  instead of every 2.6 , rest frame ) , so we resample them to 2.6 , interpolating using a fifth order polynomial fitting routine .",
    "we verified that each line index we measure on the cnoc1 spectra is unchanged if we first smooth the spectra by averaging every four pixels , and then resample using our interpolation algorithm .",
    "there is , as yet , no clear consensus in the literature about what type of galaxy is called , for example , a `` starburst '' , `` h@xmath3strong '' , `` post  starburst '' , `` e+a / k+a '' , etc .",
    "this is because the diagnostic indices are not all defined in the same way , the spectra used vary in terms of s / n and resolution , and the physical phenomena one is trying to isolate varies from author to author . in any case , such classifications are somewhat arbitrary , and there can be no objectively correct choice . for reasons discussed in  [ sec - compare ] ,",
    "we have chosen not to use the most recent classification scheme ( dressler et al .",
    "1999 ) , and thus wish to state clearly how our classes are defined . these should be compared and contrasted not only with that paper , but also , for example , the differing definitions in couch & sharples ( 1987 ) , barbaro & poggianti ( 1996 ) , barger et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and morris et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . in most cases ,",
    "the differences in classification are ones of detail , and refined precision of the evolving nomenclature .",
    "one of the main goals of this paper is to identify a population of galaxies which were forming stars a short time ( @xmath66 gyr ) ago , but have since stopped .",
    "these must be distinguished from galaxies which are currently undergoing star formation , and those which have not done so for a long time .",
    "we will make this distinction partly based on the spectra of local galaxies ( see  [ sec - defs - oiihd ] ) , and partly on model predictions , which is the purpose of this subsection .    in figure [ fig - hdtime ]",
    "we show , as the dashed line , the evolution of the @xmath1index for a galaxy with a constant star formation rate . as long as massive stars",
    "are present , nebular emission filling of h@xmath3 will reduce the index by between about 1  and 3.5  ( @xcite ) ; thus , such a spectrum will not reach @xmath1@xmath675 .",
    "all normal , star  forming galaxies",
    "are therefore expected to have @xmath1@xmath68 , and nebular emission lines .",
    "this is confirmed by the line indices of normal , spiral galaxies , as we show in  [ sec - defs - oiihd ] .    to reach @xmath1@xmath4 ,",
    "the spectral light of a galaxy must be dominated by a and early f  type stars .",

    ", the galaxy spectrum will remain of the psb type for about 300 myr .",
    "truncated star formation without a burst ( the solid line ) causes the spectrum to evolve quickly ( @xmath80 myr ) through this region , and during much of this time emission lines will be present , reducing @xmath1  to values less than 5  .",

    "this minimum correction is 1.9% ; for the field , it is 1.2% .    if we adopt the average of the minimum and maximum corrections , and half the difference to represent ( arbitrarily ) a 2@xmath11 uncertainty , we determine the best correction to be 2.3@xmath122% for the cluster , and 1.8@xmath123% for the field , resulting in corrected k+a fractions of 2.1@xmath124% and 0.1@xmath124% , respectively .",

    "these fractions are equivalent within 1@xmath11 uncertainties .",
    "the definition of a k+a galaxy adopted by zabludoff et al . differs slightly from the one we have adopted here (  [ sec - defs - oiihd ] ) in two respects .",

    "secondly , zabludoff et al .",
    "require @xmath2@xmath91 ; our lower s / n requires us to use a more generous definition of @xmath2@xmath5 .",
    "adjusting for this difference allows the inclusion of an additional @xmath181 k+a galaxies in the lcrs sample , raising the total k+a fraction to @xmath182% .",
    "since the uncertainties on the lcrs line indices are small ( due to the high s / n of the data ) , a scatter correction like the one discussed in  [ sec - scatter ] is not made .    in our luminosity limited sample (  [ sec - maglim ] ) , which most closely matches the luminosity range of the zabludoff et al . sample , the `` raw '' k+a fraction in the field is 2.7@xmath128% , which we regard as an upper limit .",
    "our best estimate of this fraction , corrected for scatter using the gaussian cloud method (  [ sec - scatter ] ) , is 1.2@xmath70.8% .",

    "much of the original work in this field was done by couch & sharples ( 1987 ) , whose dataset of 152 galaxies more luminous than about @xmath185 in three clusters at @xmath186 was later analyzed in more detail by barger et al .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig - d4hd ] , we find somewhat fewer rhds and bhds galaxies than barger et al . , though the difference is significant at less than the 2@xmath11 level , and may be partly due to an imprecise mapping of _ b - r _  to d4000 ( which was determined in  [ sec - defs - d4hd ] ) .",
    "barger et al . performed a useful and detailed analysis of the distribution of galaxies in this figure , and compared it with model simulations to determine the importance of starbursts to cluster galaxy evolution .",
    "they suggest the data are well represented by a model in which @xmath18 30% of cluster galaxies have undergone a @xmath187 gyr starburst ( which produces 1020% of the the galaxy s final stellar mass ) in the last @xmath182 gyr .",
    "given the small number of galaxies and the considerable uncertainties on the line indices , these numbers are uncertain , as the authors acknowledge . in ",

    "the couch & sharples data are also considered by poggianti & barbaro ( 1996 ) , who conclude from their modeling that strong starbursts are required to match the k+a galaxies in that sample .",

    "they find 11 ( 4.7@xmath194% ) of their cluster galaxies show k+a type spectra , remarkably similar to our total cluster fraction , before the necessary scatter correction .",
    "since their uncertainties are also comparable to ours , we expect this correction also to be similar , resulting in a reduced , true k+a fraction .",
    "a similar comparison can be made with the work of hammer et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , who find a k+a fraction of 4.9@xmath195% in the cfrs field galaxy sample , with a less precise k+a definition , roughly similar to that of fisher et al . again",
    ", this number should be reduced due to the overestimation resulting from unequal scatter and , thus , the amount of evolution implied relative to the low redshift ( lcrs ) sample will be significantly less than the order of magnitude implied by the raw fraction alone .",
    "this number is similar to our raw cluster k+a fraction , but somewhat larger than our field value .",
    "thus , it supports our conclusion that k+a galaxies are not preferentially found in clusters ; however , we note that the mean redshift of the cfrs , @xmath196 , is considerably higher than that of the cnoc1 sample , and evolutionary effects may be important .      after this paper was submitted , the morphs collaboration published a similar study based on ten clusters at @xmath197 , including 657 galaxies brighter than @xmath198 .",
    "( dressler et al . 1999 ; poggianti et al . 1999 ) .",

    "both the largeness of these fractions , and the significance of their difference , are apparently in conflict with the results we have presented in  [ sec - oiihd ] .",
    "this difference warrants a detailed comparison of the data and analysis , which we present in this subsection .",
    "we will first show that our data are of comparable quality to the morphs data , and then suggest that the differences in our conclusions may result from ( 1 ) different selection criteria ( both of galaxies and of clusters ) ; ( 2 ) different treatment of uncertainties ; and ( 3 ) differences in galaxy classifications and definitions .      we have obtained the publicly available morphs data from http://www.ociw/@xmath18irs , and computed our indices from their data directly",
    ". however , the morphs data do not include error vectors , and uncertainty estimates of their indices are unpublished ; thus care must be taken before quantitative comparisons are made with our results .",
    "in particular , continuum s / n ratios can not be computed in the same way as we have done in  [ sec - cnocsample ] .",
    "instead , we define an alternate estimate as the mean flux per pixel divided by the _ r.m.s . _ in the wavelength region @xmath31@xmath32 .",
    "this underestimates the true s / n , especially for high s / n spectra , due to real features in the spectrum . in figure [ fig - snvssnalt ]",
    "we show how this `` alternate '' value of s / n , computed for the cnoc1 galaxies , compares with our definition in  [ sec - cnocsample ] .",
    "the correlation is evident , though the scatter is large , and the underestimation of s / n at high s",
    "/ n values is clear .",
    "based on this correlation , we will assume that our alternative definition can hold as a reasonable proxy for the more realistic measurement used to qualify the cnoc1 data .    in figure [ fig - sncompare",
    "] , we compare the s / n distribution of the cnoc1 sample to that of the morphs sample ( excluding from the latter galaxies that have a quality index of 4 , which are defined as those with s / n sufficient only for a redshift determination ) . in both cases ,",
    "s / n is computed in the `` alternative '' manner described above .",
    "both samples have similar distributions , apart from a small excess of low s / n objects in the morphs sample .",
    "we can crudely assign an uncertainty to the index measurements made on the morphs sample by correlating the errors on the cnoc1 data with our alternative s / n measurement . from the s / n measured on the morphs data , we can then determine approximate index uncertainties . representing the uncertainties in @xmath1  and",
    "@xmath2  by @xmath200 and @xmath90 [ ] , respectively , we find @xmath201 and @xmath90[]@xmath202 .",
    "the uncertainty of a line index will be reduced if the resolution is improved , and the continuum s / n ratio is fixed .",
    "the morphs spectra were obtained using different telescopes and instruments , and are not all of the same resolution ; the best resolution spectra ( obtained with the cosmic spectrograph ) have a dispersion of 3.1   per pixel , and are smoothed to the instrumental resolution of @xmath203  , and rebinned to 10   per pixel .",
    "thus , the average fwhm of emission lines is comparable to that of the cnoc1 spectra , @xmath204  , as confirmed by the measurement of several [ ] lines .",
    "a second property which must be tested is the equivalence of the cnoc1 line indices to those measured by the morphs collaboration . in figure [ fig - comparehd ] we show the values of our @xmath1  index , defined in  [ sec - indices ] and measured on the morphs spectra , compared with those of dressler et al .",
    "we exclude galaxies with quality indices of 4 , or flagged as uncertain .",
    "the latter were usually computed by interactively fitting the continuum and then fitting a gaussian profile to the absorption or emission lines . given the noisy nature of the data , and the generally complex region of the spectrum under consideration , we find that such an interactive approach is difficult to duplicate , and makes uncertainty estimates difficult to determine reliably . nonetheless , the correlation between our h@xmath3 index and that of dressler et al .",
    "is fairly good .",
    "in particular , we recover the large @xmath1  indices measured in many cases by dressler et al . , showing that our index is not insensitive to spectra of this type . the scatter in this figure reflects the fact that both of these indices have considerable uncertainties .      in figure [ fig - hdoii_morphs ]",
    "we show the morphs data in the @xmath2-@xmath1  plane , with our region delineations from  [ sec - defs - oiihd ] , and the measurements we have made using our index definitions (  [ sec - indices ] ) .",
    "we exclude data of quality index 4 , and mark as open circles those galaxies which are either flagged as having uncertain @xmath1  measurements , or for which no @xmath1  measurement is listed in the morphs catalogue ( i.e. , they are listed as either indef , or 0 ) .",
    "furthermore , no magnitude limit is imposed .",
    "the sample error bars represent the mean error in each index .",
    "the field sample is somewhat biased to lower s / n galaxies and , hence , results in larger mean index errors .    we will not attempt to evaluate the fractions of each type of galaxy ( k+a , sf etc . ) that we have defined for galaxies in this plane , due to the difficulty in correcting for the morphologically based selection ( see smail et al .",
    "there is clearly , however , a strong presence of k+a galaxies in the cluster sample that is not observed in the field . for most ( 20/24 ) of the galaxies with @xmath1@xmath205  , dressler et al .",
    "( 1999 ) either did not measure @xmath1 or the measurement was flagged as uncertain ( open circles ) .",
    "often , this is due to poor sky subtraction near the line , which should result in large index uncertainties that justify their removal from the sample ( as we do for our maximal sample in  [ sec - maxsamp ] ) .",
    "however a large population of cluster k+a galaxies with @xmath1@xmath206  persists .",
    "this strong population is clearly not as abundant in the morphs field sample , in contrast with the results found in our sample ( figure [ fig - hdoii ] ) . due to the unusual selection criteria , however ,",
    "the absolute fraction of k+a galaxies in the two samples can not be easily compared in a quantitative way .      given that the cnoc1 resolution , s / n distribution and line index definitions are comparable to those of the morphs collaboration , what is the source for the difference in results ?",
    "we discuss three possibilities below .",
    "* cluster selection : * given that galaxy clusters are a very heterogeneous class of objects , with differing galaxy populations , some or all of the difference between the morphs and cnoc1 results may be in cluster selection .",
    "the cnoc1 clusters are among the most x  ray luminous at these redshifts , often containing cooling flows , and are mostly dynamically relaxed ( lewis et al .",
    "it is quite possible that , as a class , these clusters differ from the more heterogeneously selected clusters in the morphs sample ( though we confirm k+a fractions of @xmath207% for the two clusters in common with both samples ) .",
    "furthermore , the morphs clusters are generally at higher redshifts than the cnoc1 targets ; all but four of the cnoc1 clusters lie at redshifts less than that of the lowest redshift morphs cluster , a370 .",
    "* galaxy selection : * the selection of spectroscopic targets from the photometric sample differs in the two surveys . the morphs sample was primarily selected based on galaxy morphology ; sd / irregular galaxies are oversampled relative to earlier types . since late  type galaxies were targeted preferentially , the detection of a large population of starburst and/or post  starburst galaxies may not be surprising .",
    "dressler et al . ( 1999 ) attempt to correct for this by comparing the morphological distribution of their spectroscopic sample with the photometric sample , but this correction is not completely reliable since the statistical correction for late type field galaxies is uncertain ( @xcite ) . alternatively ,",
    "the primary selection criterion in the cnoc1 sample is apparent magnitude , with small corrections for galaxy color and position .",
    "in particular , we note that any color selection effect is quite small , and there does not seem to be a significant bias to our results as a function of galaxy spectral type at these apparent magnitudes . as discussed in section [ sec - weights ] , we used weighting functions to correct our sample of line indices to be representative of the full photometric sample in the cluster fields",
    ".    we also note that the cnoc1 survey includes galaxies at much larger distances from the cluster center , as shown in figure [ fig - morphsrad ] .",
    "however , the lack of an observable gradient in the k+a fraction ( figure [ fig - hdoii_z ] ) makes it unlikely that this can have a strong effect .",
    "* uncertainties : * no uncertainties are published for the line indices presented in dressler et al . ( 1999 ) or poggianti et al . ( 1999 ) . as we have shown in ",
    "[ sec - scatter ] , the large uncertainties of our indices result in an overestimate of the k+a fraction ; since we believe the morphs index uncertainties to be comparable to ours , the same holds true for their sample , and some correction for this effect must be made .",
    "index measurements for galaxies with undetectable or hard to measure lines are not listed in dressler et al . and ,",
    "thus , the scatter in the measurements that do exist does not accurately reflect the average uncertainty of the data .    * galaxy classifications : * based on unpublished recomputations of the barbaro & poggianti ( 1996 ) models , using their new @xmath1  definition , poggianti et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have chosen a threshold of @xmath1@xmath82   for their classification of k+a / a+k galaxies .",
    "this is considerably lower than we have adopted for our k+a definition , and clearly leads to the identification of a larger population of `` unusual '' galaxies .",
    "we have justified our limit not only by comparison with the pegase models , but also by comparison with the local data of kennicutt et al .",
    "( 1992a ) and kinney et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . from figure [ fig - hdoii_local ]",
    "alone , it is clear that galaxies with @xmath1@xmath82  and no detectable [ ] emission are _ not _ exclusively k+as , but include normal s0 and early spiral galaxies . since the dressler et al .",
    "@xmath1  threshold is significantly lower than previously adopted by many other authors ( e.g. , @xcite ) , we chose not to adopt their lower limit . adopting 3  instead of 5  as our lower limit for the classification of k+a galaxies would increase the fraction of galaxies that satisfy this definition1.1% of cluster galaxies , and 9.1@xmath71.6% of field galaxies in our luminosity limit sample have @xmath1@xmath82 , and @xmath2@xmath5  ( uncorrected for scatter ) . ] .",
    "to some extent , of course , the choice of limiting @xmath1  is quite arbitrary and of little consequence as long as it is interpreted as such , and accounted for when comparisons with other work is made .      with the exception of the morphs results ( @xcite ) ,",
    "the surveys discussed above are not inconsistent out our principal results , which are : ( 1 ) the fraction of k+a galaxies ( as defined in  [ sec - defs - oiihd ] ) in the field and x ",
    "ray luminous clusters at @xmath208 is less than 5% ; ( 2 ) it has not been shown conclusively that the @xmath19 k+a fraction is significantly larger than the fraction at @xmath10 ; and ( 3 ) there is no strong evidence yet that k+a galaxies are more common in cluster environments than in the field .",
    "we suggest that the higher fractions of k+a galaxies found by the morphs group may come from the very different methodologies used , especially in the selection of the galaxy sample .",
    "we suggest that the simpler cnoc1 sample and weighting functions are likely to produce a fair sampling of the cluster populations .",
    "in addition , there may be an actual difference in the populations of our two differently selected cluster samples . in that case",
    ", it remains to be seen whether clusters at these redshifts are better typified by the x - ray luminous cnoc1 sample , or the more heterogeneous morphs sample .",
    "it was shown in balogh et al .",
    "( 1997 ) that the star formation rate ( determined from [ ] emission lines ) at all radii within cnoc1 clusters is always less than that in the field galaxy population .",
    "however , if a substantial fraction of cluster galaxies have undergone massive but very short starbursts , as postulated for example by barger et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , the short duration of these bursts ( @xmath33100 myr ) would mean that only a small fraction of cluster galaxies would be observed in the burst phase at a given epoch .    according to the results of the pegase models , following a short burst",
    "a galaxy will appear as a psb or psf type for between 0.75 and 1 gyr .",
    "thus , the starburst rate can be determined from the abundance of these `` remnants '' . for our maximal sample (  [ sec - maxsamp ] ) , the fraction of these galaxies in the cluster is less than 6.2@xmath70.7% ; this is an upper limit because it does not include the correction for non - uniform scatter .",
    "this implies that , in the last 2 gyr , less than approximately 15@xmath199% of the galaxy population may have undergone a starburst . using our best estimate for the scatter correction from table [ tab - hds ] ,",
    "the corrected fraction of cluster psb and psf galaxies is 2.2@xmath209% , which reduces the estimated starburst population to only @xmath210% in the last 2 gyr .",
    "this is much less than the 30% estimated by barger et al .",
    "part of this difference is due to the factor of two difference between the abundance of hds galaxies in our respective samples , as shown in figure [ fig - d4hd ] ( significant at the @xmath211 level ) .",
    "secondly , our fractions are reduced due to the scatter correction , though barger et al .",
    "include their uncertainties in their models , which should account for this effect if their error bars are reliable .",
    "finally , barger et al .",
    "actually model the hds galaxies ( which comprise 4.6@xmath71.8% of our cluster sample , after scatter correction ) with post  starburst tracks ; however , some of these have [ ] emission ( the a+em galaxies ) , and can not therefore be truly post  starburst .    poggianti et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have recently suggested that the a+em galaxies are dusty starbursts which may later evolve into k+a types ; the strong balmer lines arise because the ob - stars responsible for the emission lines are heavily obscured by dust , while the longer lived a stars have migrated out of their birthplaces and are more widespread throughout the galaxy , so that their light dominates the spectrum . in our cluster sample ,",
    "we find 3.0@xmath209% of the galaxies have a+em spectra , after scatter correction .",
    "this is almost two times larger than the k+a galaxy fraction and implies that the a+em phase must last at least twice as long as the k+a phase if the two types are evolutionarily linked , and if _ all _ a+em galaxies evolve into k+a types .",
    "thus , these dusty starbursts should either be fairly long  lived , with lifetimes of more than 1.5 gyr , or a large fraction of them never evolve into k+a types .",
    "the fraction of field galaxies classified a+em , @xmath102% , is twice as large as the cluster fraction .",
    "thus , the cluster environment does not appear to be responsible for preferentially generating these galaxy types , whether or not they are starbursts .",
    "it is also possible that , if this interpretation of a+em spectra is correct , some k+a galaxies are just a more extreme example , in which the [ oii]@xmath123727  line is completely obscured , as pointed out by poggianti et al . in this case , a+em and k+a galaxies are not evolutionary counterparts , but representative of the same , starburst phenomenon .    assuming that k+a galaxies are the result of recently terminated star formation",
    ", we can use the fractions of psf and psb galaxies in our sample to assess the relative contribution of starbursts and truncated star formation to this scenario . in general , pegase models of post  starburst galaxies spend roughly an equal amount of time in both psb and psf stages , while truncated star formation leads only to psf galaxies , lasting about 300 myr after the star formation activity ceases ( see  [ sec - defs - d4hd ] ) .",
    "thus , if starbursts are the dominant mechanism for generating hds galaxies , there should be ( roughly ) an equal number of psb and psf galaxies . as shown in ",
    "[ sec - d4hd ] , the psf fraction in both cluster and field environments may be much higher ( @xmath135 times ) than the psb fraction .",
    "if this overabundance is real , it suggests that at least some of the galaxies may have had their star formation truncated without a burst , as supported , for example , by recent simulations ( fujita et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the lack of a marked excess of k+a or a+em galaxies relative to the field may suggest that the cluster environment does not actively truncate _ or _ induce star formation , but merely inhibits it from regenerating once it has ceased .",
    "for example , in the galaxy formation model of baugh , cole & frenk ( 1996 ) , after a merger of two spiral galaxies succeeds in producing an elliptical galaxy , halo material may recollapse to form a new disk .",
    "this reformation of a stable disk could conceivably be inhibited in the cluster environment , due to the presence of strong tidal fields and galaxy harassment .",
    "furthermore , the halo of gas surrounding a spiral galaxy , which may continually cool onto the disk , forming new stars , may be easily stripped away when a galaxy falls into a cluster ( @xcite ) .",
    "the conditions for this to happen are much less stringent than those for stripping all the gas out of the galactic disk . in either of these cases",
    ", k+a galaxies will generally evolve to become passive within the cluster once they have exhausted their gas supply , whereas , in the field , many will again become star  forming galaxies .",
    "starbursts and k+a phases are then interpreted as natural stages in galaxy evolution ( i.e. , galaxies form stars in bursts , not continuously ) , and the cluster merely prevents a galaxy from recommencing its star formation once the activity has stopped of its own accord .",
    "we are currently analyzing dark matter simulations of clusters to link a galaxy s star formation history to the time elapsed since it was accreted .",
    "preliminary analysis shows that a gradual reduction of sfr following galaxy accretion adequately reproduces the radial gradient of star formation ( balogh et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "there are several caveats which may alter the conclusions described above , and there are several ways in which future observations may address these issues ; we list these caveats below :    * once statistical correction weights are included , our spectroscopic sample is representative of a photometric sample complete to @xmath212 . when star formation is truncated in the more numerous , faint galaxy population , they will fade and many will drop below this limit . indeed , the k+a galaxies in our sample appear to be of intrinsically low luminosity .",
    "it is also known that the less luminous galaxies evolve more significantly with redshift ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and thus contribute more to the butcher  oemler effect .",
    "thus , it is possible that there exists a large number of faint k+a galaxies which we are not detecting , and these may show an environmental preference . *",
    "whether or not an equal fraction of k+a galaxies in the cluster and field necessarily implies an equal production rate of starbursts in both environments is somewhat model  dependent , as it may only be a subset of the total population that is ever engaged in starburst activity . for example , the results of ellis et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and barger et al .",
    "( 1998 ) suggest that most cluster ellipticals formed from a single burst many gyr ago , and have since evolved passively .",
    "if we assume that the passive type galaxies play no part in cluster evolution , then the fraction of `` active '' galaxies in clusters that have a k+a spectrum is @xmath213% , ( corrected for scatter effects ) .",
    "however , it is not yet clear how many of the passive galaxies are safely excluded in this manner ; many of our passive galaxies have spectra consistent with those of early type spirals and s0 galaxies .",
    "furthermore , it is not clear what fraction of the field galaxies are also `` primordial '' ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) . *",
    "the [ oii ] index is metallicity dependent , which affects star formation rates derived from its measurement ; however , this dependence is fairly weak ( @xcite ) and unlikely to strongly affect our results .",
    "more important is the fact that this blue feature is quite sensitive to dust obscuration , and many of the psb or psf galaxies with @xmath2@xmath207  may have significant , but dust  obscured , star formation ( e.g. , poggianti et al .",
    "infrared spectroscopy and imaging , and measurements of h@xmath76 emission , will be helpful in constraining this effect . *",
    "the k+a population is known to be morphologically heterogeneous ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "if high resolution hst imaging reveals that k+a galaxies in clusters are morphologically distinct from those in the field , this may support models in which the mechanisms which are responsible for generating k+a galaxies are environment  dependent . *",
    "kauffmann ( 1995 ) and andreon & ettori ( 1999 ) have suggested that the x  ray luminous clusters observed at moderate redshifts are not the evolutionary predecessors of the less luminous , low redshift clusters to which they are often compared . in particular , the cnoc1 sample is composed of the most x  ray luminous clusters in the universe and , hence , may have unique or unusual galaxy populations ; this may be responsible for some of the discrepancy between our results and those of dressler et al .",
    "we note , however , that andreon & ettori find no dependence of the blue galaxy fraction on x  ray luminosity , specifically . *",
    "finally , the field sample drawn from the foreground and background of these rich clusters may be unusual in some way , though results are generally consistent with the field samples of other groups ( @xcite ) .",
    "work is currently being undertaken to address this issue using the cnoc2 field galaxy sample ( ellingson et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "we have presented a detailed analysis of the spectral characteristics of a large sample of galaxies in x  ray luminous clusters between z=0.18 and z=0.55 , and of an identically selected field galaxy sample .",
    "we focus on three spectral indices : d4000 , which traces the old stellar population ; @xmath1 , which indicates the presence of a  type stars and is sensitive to star formation that took place up to 1 gyr ago ; and the @xmath2  index , which indicates current star formation activity .",
    "we compare our data to the model predictions of fioc & rocca  volmerange ( 1997 ) and bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) , and draw the following conclusions :    * the radial trends within the cluster sample are consistent with a continuous age sequence , in the sense that the last episode of star formation occurred more recently for the outermost galaxies than for the central galaxies .",
    "* we define k+a galaxies as those with @xmath2@xmath5 , and @xmath1@xmath4 .",
    "our measured k+a galaxy fraction is @xmath6% in the cluster and @xmath95% in the field , but this is only an upper limit due to the large index errors which tend to overestimate these numbers . attempting to correct for this effect , we find the true fraction of k+a galaxies to be only 2.1@xmath70.7% in the cluster environment , and 0.1@xmath70.7% in the field . for our luminosity limited sample ( galaxies brighter than @xmath214 ) , these corrected values are 1.5@xmath128% ( cluster ) and 1.2@xmath128% ( field ) .",
    "our field results are consistent with the lcrs @xmath215 fraction of 0.30% ( @xcite ) at the @xmath216 level . * the fraction of cluster galaxies which are undergoing , or have recently undergone , a short burst of star formation is not significantly greater than the field fraction , at any redshift or distance from the cluster center . from the fraction of psb and psf galaxies , we conclude that less than @xmath1810% of the galaxies in both the cluster and the field may have undergone short starbursts in the last 2 gyr . *",
    "if all the a+em galaxies are dusty starbursts and progenitors of the k+a galaxies , then these must be undergoing fairly long  lived episodes of star formation ( @xmath217 gyr ) .",
    "these galaxies are two times more common in our field sample than in the cluster .",
    "* we find that psf galaxies may outnumber psb galaxies by a factor of 5 - 10 , in both cluster and field environments ( though the samples are small ) .",
    "comparison with models suggests that truncated star formation _ without _ a short starburst phase may play a significant role in galaxy evolution . *",
    "more photometry of the cnoc1 fields is still needed ; particularly k  band to constrain the total stellar mass , and u  band to independently measure star formation rates .",
    "infrared imaging and spectroscopy is needed to determine the amount of dust  obscured star formation , and hst images are required to subclassify the various galaxies types morphologically .    keeping in mind the caveats listed at the end of  [ sec - discuss ] , we can discuss some of the implications of our results .",
    "the general trend for higher redshift clusters to be bluer ( the b  o effect ) has not yet been linked to a population of galaxies unique to the cluster environment .",
    "the simplest explanation consistent with the current data is that the b  o effect in clusters largely reflects the increased level of star formation in the field at larger redshifts .",
    "secondly , there is no evidence that recent ( @xmath751 gyr ) cluster  induced star formation is responsible for driving the differential evolution between cluster and field within the virial radius , since there is no tell  tale population of starburst or post  starburst cluster galaxies that does not exist in the field .",
    "we speculate that the presence of bursting galaxies , and the possible increase of such galaxies with redshift , reflects the general nature of star  forming galaxies , independent of environment .",
    "however , galaxies in dense environments are eventually _ prevented _ from bursting , perhaps because their halo gas reservoir has been stripped .",
    "this , coupled with a population of `` primordial '' ellipticals and perhaps some truncation due to ram pressure stripping of disk gas , could be responsible for the older stellar populations which inhabit cluster environments .",
    "the data used in this paper form part of the cnoc1 study of intermediate  redshift clusters .",
    "we are grateful to all the consortium members and to the cfht staff for their contributions to this project .",
    "mlb is supported by a natural sciences and engineering research council of canada ( nserc ) research grant to c. j. pritchet and an nserc postgraduate scholarship .",
    "mlb is grateful to j. f. navarro and a. zabludoff for useful discussions .",
    "in this appendix we will discuss in more detail the pegase models shown in figure [ fig - models_local ] , on which our galaxy classification system (  [ sec - defs - d4hd ] ) is partly based .",
    "the large , open star in figure [ fig - models_local ] represents the model result for a galaxy with a constant star formation rate , of any intensity .",
    "it represents the maximum h@xmath3 absorption one can expect in a normal galaxy ; emission filling will reduce its value by between roughly 1 and 3.5  ( @xcite ) .",
    "this point lies blueward of our d4000 cut , within the sf region .",
    "all of the galaxies in the sf region are either spirals , irregulars , or `` starburst '' galaxies , and do not have @xmath1stronger than the model constant star  formation point ( with the exception of ngc 3034 , discussed in  [ sec - defs - oiihd ] ) .",
    "only if the star formation activity has begun recently ( within the last 200 myr , barbaro & poggianti , 1997 ) will h@xmath3 emission overwhelm the absorption and the galaxies will then occupy the short starburst ( ssb ) region of this figure .",
    "the long  dashed line in figure [ fig - models_local ] traces the evolutionary path of a galaxy with an exponentially decaying star formation rate ; it evolves from `` birth '' at d4000@xmath218 , redward . in this case , a decay time of @xmath219 gyr is adopted , and the galaxy is evolved to 11 gyr , which we expect to be the maximum age of cnoc1 galaxies , in reasonable cosmological models . most of the local spirals in the kennicutt ( 1992b ) and kinney et al .",
    "( 1996 ) samples lie close to this curve .",
    "galaxies of this type with ages greater than about 5 gyr will lie in the passive region ; clearly this includes not only e and s0 type galaxies , but also early type spirals .",
    "note that the oldest models have @xmath1@xmath220 ; this reflects the nature of our specific index definition , which in this case is telling more about features in the continuum , rather than the intrinsic h@xmath3 absorption ( see  [ sec - indices ] ) .",
    "the evolution of a galaxy produced by an initial burst of star formation lasting 200 myr is shown as the short  dashed line in figure [ fig - models_local ] .",
    "after the burst ends , this spectrum always has stronger @xmath1  than the exponentially decaying star  formation model , until d4000@xmath221 .",
    "it spends roughly 300 myr in the bhds region and another 300 myr in the rhds region .",
    "the dotted line represents the evolution of a galaxy which underwent constant star formation for 4 gyr , followed by a 200 myr starburst involving 30% of its mass , after which all star formation was terminated .",
    "this model track only follows the evolution after the end of the starburst .",
    "the model closely traces the initial burst model , but does not reach as strong values of @xmath1 .",
    "the duration and strength of the burst are quite arbitrary ; longer bursts and bursts involving smaller amounts of stellar mass result in weaker maximum @xmath1  indices ; this parameter space has been explored extensively by poggianti & barbaro ( 1996 ) , though we warn that our @xmath1  indices are defined differently and are not directly comparable with theirs .",
    "the rhds galaxies can originate not only from a terminated ssb phase , but also from a galaxy in which long  term star formation has recently ended ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we model this latter case by terminating star formation in a galaxy which has undergone constant star formation for 4 gyr ; this is shown in figure [ fig - models_local ] as the solid line",
    ". once the star formation is terminated , the galaxy quickly reddens , passing into the rhds region within 100 myr .",
    "it then spends about 300 myr in the rhds region before @xmath1  further weakens and the spectrum becomes a passive type .",

    "<S> however , this is still not significantly greater than the fraction of such galaxies in the field , 3.1@xmath14% . </S>",

    "<S> ( 1999 ) have recently suggested are dusty starbursts are twice as common in the field as in the cluster environment .    </S>",
    "<S> our results imply that these cluster environments are not responsible for inducing starbursts ; thus , the increase in cluster blue galaxy fraction with redshift may not be a strictly cluster  specific phenomenon . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the truncation of star formation in clusters may largely be a gradual process , perhaps due to the exhaustion of gas in the galactic disk over fairly long timescales ; in this case differential evolution may result because field galaxies can refuel their disk with gas from an extended halo , thus regenerating star formation , while cluster galaxies may not have such a halo and so continue to evolve passively . </S>"
