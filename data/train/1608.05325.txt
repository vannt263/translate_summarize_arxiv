    "phase transitions are an interesting trait of physical systems . in particular , when dealing with quantum many - body set - ups it is curious that a well defined microscopic description can lead to non - trivial and singular behaviours in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the study of the equilibrium properties of such systems is well established in , for example , exactly solvable one - dimensional spin chains  @xcite . with the help of several tools from quantum information , notably quantum correlations , the implications of the presence of quantum phase transitions ( qpts )",
    "have been explored  @xcite .    beyond the static properties ,",
    "there is a growing interest in studying the dynamics of many - body quantum systems .",
    "this is further catalysed by the increasing interest in understanding the thermodynamic properties of genuinely quantum systems  @xcite . despite the significantly more involved nature of studying dynamics ,",
    "remarkable progress has been made in elucidating the behaviour of important quantities , e.g. ( irreversible ) work , entropy production , and residual energy , when a many - body system is evolved through its critical point .",
    "the most frequent evolution considered is that of a  sudden quench \" of the order parameter  @xcite ( we remark that finite time protocols have also been addressed  @xcite ) .",
    "focusing on such a sudden change allows us to capture the salient features of the ensuing non - equilibrium dynamics , while leaving the study of more qualitative differences to a more involved temporal analysis .",
    "typically , the sudden change to the hamiltonian kicks the system out of equilibrium and can lead to interesting consequences .",
    "notably , for the ising model the dynamics of a sudden quench have been explored and it has been shown that the irreversible entropy production provides signals of the presence of the equilibrium qpt  @xcite , and also can be used to explain emergent phenomena such as the vanishing gap between ground and first excited energy levels in the thermodynamic limit  @xcite . recently , the irreversible work was shown to faithfully capture the critical features even for so - called impurity qpts  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we add to this endeavour by studying the lipkin - meshkiv - glick model  @xcite .",
    "the model has attracted substantial interest as it serves as the paradigmatic example of an infinite range interacting system .",
    "it can be solved in the thermodynamic limit and exhibits a complex phase diagram  @xcite",
    ". we will be interested in exploring how clear signatures of the equilibrium qpt is manifest in the dynamics when the model is quenched through its critical point .",
    "we remark that the evolution of this model through its qpt have been studied previously in ref .",
    "@xcite wherein the equal time - order parameter correlation function was examined and ref .",
    "@xcite where the adiabatic dynamics were explored .",
    "our study is set apart from these as it seeks to establish a rigorous link between the thermodynamic quantities such as work and free energy , with the presence of the known qpt . by exploiting the loschmidt echo",
    "we show that the dynamics are manifestly different when the quench is restricted to a particular phase compared to when the system is quenched through the critical point .",
    "more interestingly , we explicitly show that while the average work performed on the system due to the quench is blind to the qpt , the free energy , and therefore the irreversible work , appears acutely sensitive , showing a markedly different rates of change .",
    "finally , we use the spectral function to further understand the fundamental excitations governing the dynamics of the system .",

    "however , an important remark , only when @xmath9 does the gap vanish and all eigenstates become doubly degenerate .",
    "hence , for any finite size there is a small difference between the ground and first excited states  @xcite .",

    "however in the inset we examine its rate of change , and we see for @xmath32 this rate is linear , and there is a sudden change near @xmath48 . while it is not surprising that the free energy exhibits a non - trivial behavior as we go through the critical point in light of the fact that is defined in terms of the ground state energy , the fact that both @xmath47 and @xmath28 are of the same order of magnitude leads to a trade off between the two quantities .",
    "this has interesting consequences for the irreversibility of the process captured by @xmath49 .",
    "panel * ( c ) * shows that when the quench is small and confined to the same phase as the initial state , @xmath50 , indicating that the process is fully reversible , as confirmed by the behavior of the le which achieves values of unity during the dynamics . for large quenches , when the system is evolved according to a hamiltonian in the ferromagnetic phase the average irreversible work becomes non - zero , and the degree of irreversibility grows as the magnitude of the quench increases .",

    "therefore , by quenching the field strength and kicking the system out - of - equilibrium , it quickly becomes excited and occupies higher order states . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we see this effect clearly , contrary to the previous section , we see even for moderately small quenches ( @xmath53 ) the le reaches zero , indicating the evolved state is orthogonal .",
    "we further remark , the larger the system the smaller the quench required to achieve dynamical orthogonality , again this is a consequence of the fact that the energy gap between the ground and first excited states decreases with increasing @xmath52",
    ". thus we can not use the presence of orthogonality to witness signatures of the qpt in the dynamics .",
    "however , there is a clear qualitative difference appearing when the quench is near to or above the critical point . for quenches to @xmath54 the le evolves into fully orthogonal states for a period , before exhibiting short time revivals .",
    "the height of these peaks are steadily decreasing in the considered time window , and the width of the revivals broadens .",
    "this indicates a sizeable increase in the irreversibility of the process when quenches into the paramagnetic phase are considered .",
    "we confirm this behavior in fig .",
    "panel * ( a ) * shows that the work is a linear function of the magnitude of the quench .",
    "however , the free energy and the irreversibility show the same qualitative behavior as shown in the previous section .",
    "focussing on the average irreversible work , due to the vanishingly small gap between the ground and first excited states , we see even small quenches are accompanied by a degree of irreversibility , the rate of which grows as the magnitude of the quench is increased .",

    "we show the sfs for several quenches , both when the quench remains in the same initial phase , and when it is across the critical point . we restrict ourselves to @xmath56 for simplicity ,",
    "although we remark qualitatively similar results hold for larger systems .    in panel * ( a ) * we assume the system begins in the paramagnetic phase fixing @xmath39 . for no quench , i.e. @xmath57 , the sf is a single peak exactly at the ground state energy . for small quenches staying within the paramagnetic phase we see",
    "the dynamics continues to be dictated only by the ground state , and this helps understand why the process is fully reversible . as we approach the critical point a second peak appears , corresponding to the second excited state of the final hamiltonian . when @xmath58 this second peak becomes more prominent .",
    "quenching into the ferromagnetic phase , we see significantly more levels enter into the dynamics of the system .",
    "interestingly although the the ground state still contributes to the dynamics , higher excited states play a significantly more dominant role and this results in dynamical orthogonality .",
    "we remark , the model naturally has two distinct subspaces .",

    "however , now even for small quenches , @xmath37 , due to the significantly more dense energy spectrum in this phase , more ( even excitation ) levels play a role in dictating the dynamics of the system , and therefore the system almost immediately witnesses dynamic orthogonality .",
    "this in turns allows us to understand the significantly larger irreversibility of the process when quenching from the ferromagnetic into the paramagnetic phase .",

    "we see the sf spreads . for @xmath40 deep in the paramagnetic phase the sf",
    "is very spread , and again since we have quenched through the qpt , we see higher excited states play the most dominant role in the dynamics .",
    "we have examined the dynamics arising by quenching the parameters of the many - body interacting lipkin - meshkov - glick ( lmg ) model . starting from the ground state in a particular phase , and using the loschmidt echo ( le ) ,",
    "we have shown that manifestly different dynamics occur when the quench is restricted to the same initial phase compared to a quench through the critical point . by employing tools from quantum thermodynamics",
    "we have shown that the average work maintains a linear relationship with the magnitude of the quench , regardless if it is through the quantum phase transition ( qpt ) or not .",
    "in contrast , the free energy and irreversible work are acutely sensitive to this difference .",
    "we find that quenching through the qpt leads to significant increases in the degree of irreversibility .",
    "this result can also help in understanding why controlling such many - body systems is so difficult through their qpts  @xcite , as it is this irreversibility that needs to be controlled . starting from the paramagnetic phase , where there is a sizeable energy gap between the ground and first excited states , we have shown the occurrence of dynamical orthogonality serves as a remarkable witness of criticality in the model .",
    "furthermore , by examining the spectral function we have shown that when the quench is through the critical point , the fundamental excitations that govern the dynamics are no longer dictated primarily by the ground state , but in fact higher excited states play the most prominent role .",
    "our results highlight the interesting role the static properties of a many - body system can play in its dynamics .",
