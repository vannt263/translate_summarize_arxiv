    "almost a decade elapsed since the first detection of the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background at large angular scales ( @xmath2 ) @xcite , @xcite . today",
    "the cmb anisotropy ( cmba ) has been detected also at intermediate ( @xmath3 ) and small angular scales ( @xmath4 ) , so the cmba angular spectrum is now reasonably known down to the region of the  first  and  second  doppler  peaks  @xcite ,  @xcite , @xcite .",
    "its shape gives information e.g. on the spectrum of the primordial cosmological perturbations or can be used to test the inflation theory but rises new questions to which cmba can not answers .",
    "it is however possible to get answers looking  at  the  cmb  polarization  ( cmbp ) .",
    "for instance one can use cmbp to disentangle the effects of fundamental cosmological parameters like density of matter , density of dark energy etc .",
    "this is among the goals of space and ground based experiments like @xcite , @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and is the main goal of sport a polarization dedicated asi / esa space mission on the international space station @xcite .",
    "the relevance of the cmb polarization was remarked for the first time by m. rees @xcite . since his paper many models of the expected features of the cmbp",
    "have been published ( see for instance @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "they  immediately  stimulated  the  search  for cmbp , but the first detection has been obtained only a few months ago ( @xcite and @xcite ) . because of its importance this discovery must be confirmed by new observations made with different systems and using different methods of extraction of the cmbp from the sky signal .",
    "the detection of the cmbp is in fact extremely difficult because the signal is at least an order of magnitude below the cmba level .",
    "moreover polarized foregrounds of galactic origin may cover the cmbp and/or mimic cmbp spots by their inhomogeneities .",
    "the signal to noise ( cmbp @xmath5 polarized foreground ) ratio is therefore @xmath6 . in this paper",
    "we discuss a method which improves this ratio and allows to disentangle cmbp and polarized foregrounds .    in the microwave range the galactic foregrounds include :    * synchrotron radiation ( strong polarization ) ,",
    "* free - free emission ( null or negligible polarization ) , * dust radiation ( polarization possible )    beccause here we are interested in polarization , in the following we will neglect free - free emission.the effects of dust , if present , ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) , will be added to the synchrotron effects .",
    "in fact , as it will appears in the following , what matters in our analysis are the statistical properties of the spatial distribution of the foregrounds and , by good fortune , the spatial distribution of the dust polarized emission is similar to that of the synchrotron emission . behind both types of radiation",
    "there is in fact the same driving force , the galactic magnetic field which alignes dust grains and guides the radiating electrons ( @xcite and references therein ) .    for the anisotropy",
    "the separation of foregrounds and cmb  was  successfully solved  by  the dmr / cobe  team  when  they  discovered  cmba @xcite .",
    "the separation of cmbp and foregrounds is more  demanding  and recognizing true cmb spots among foreground inhomogneities severe .",
    "approaches  commonly  used ( e.g.  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite , +  @xcite ) , are based on the differences between the frequency spectra of foregrounds and cmb , therefore require multifrequency observations .    in this paper",
    "we suggest a different method .",
    "it takes advantage of the fact that , as we will show in the following , at small angular scales the values of the parameters used to describes the polarization of the diffuse radiation at a given frequency in different directions fluctuate .",
    "we propose of analyzing the angular distribution of the polarized radiation on single frequency maps of the diffuse radiation and disentangling the main components , polarized synchrotron and cmbp , looking to their different statistical properties .",
    "this method was proposed and briefly discussed in @xcite . here",
    "we present a more complete analysis .",
    "convenient  quantities  commonly  used  to  describe  the  polarization  status  of  radiation  are the stokes parameters  ( see  for  instance +  @xcite ,  @xcite , +  @xcite ) .",
    "let s assume a monochromatic plane wave of intensity i and amplitude @xmath7 . in the _ observer plane _",
    ", orthogonal to the direction of propagation of the electromagnetic wave , we can choose a pair of orthogonal axes @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "on that plane the amplitude vector of an unpolarized wave moves in a random way . on the contrary",
    "it describes a figure , the _ polarization ellipse _",
    ", when the wave is polarized .    projecting the wave amplitude on @xmath8 and @xmath9 we get two orthogonal , linearly polarized , waves of intensity @xmath10 and @xmath11,(@xmath12 ) whose amplitudes are @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively .",
    "if the original wave of intensity @xmath15 is polarized , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are correlated : lets call @xmath16 and @xmath17 their correlation products .    by definition",
    "the stokes parameters are : @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath22 and @xmath23 describe the linear polarization , @xmath24 the circular polarization and @xmath15 the total intensity .",
    "the ratio    @xmath25    gives the angle @xmath26 between the vector @xmath27 and the main axis of the polarization ellipse ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "rotation by an angle @xmath29 of the @xmath30 coordinate system give a new coordinate system @xmath31 in which the stokes parameters become    @xmath32    so when @xmath33 the axes of the polarization ellipse coincide with the reference axes @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( see fig.[f2 ] ) .      to analyze the properties of the cmb polarization",
    "it is sometimes convenient to use rotationally invariant quantities , like the radiation intensity @xmath15 and two combinations of @xmath23 and @xmath22 : @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the intensity @xmath15 can be decomposed into usual ( scalar ) spherical harmonics @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath39    the quantities @xmath40  can  be  decomposed  into  @xmath41  spin harmonics + @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite + @xmath42 : @xmath43    the @xmath41 spin harmonics form a complete orthonormal system ( see , for instance , @xcite,@xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and can be written @xcite , @xcite : @xmath44    where @xmath45 is a generalized jacobi polynomial , @xmath46 and : @xmath47 is a normalization factor .",
    "the harmonics amplitudes @xmath48 correspond to the fourier spectrum of the angular decomposition of rotationally invariant combinations of stokes parameters .    because spin @xmath41 spherical functions form a complete orthonormal system : @xmath49",
    "we can write @xmath50    following @xcite and the very nice introduction made more recently by @xcite we now introduce the so called _ @xmath51 ( electric ) _ and _ @xmath52 ( magnetic ) modes _ of these harmonic quantities : @xmath53    they have different parities .",
    "in fact when we transform the coordinate system @xmath54 into a new coordinate system @xmath55 , such that    @xmath56    the e and b modes transform in a similar way : @xmath57    @xmath22 remains identical in both reference systems and @xmath23 changes sign .",
    "it is important to remark that @xmath58 and @xmath59 are uncorrelated .    in terms of @xmath22 and @xmath23",
    "we can write : @xmath60    therefore : @xmath61 here @xmath62 and @xmath63 designate values of delta correlated 2d stochastic fields @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "omitting mathematical details , the correlation equations for @xmath22 and @xmath23 are : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the dirac delta - function on the sphere .",
    "( in the following we will sometimes omit indexes @xmath66 and @xmath67 ) .",
    "synchrotron radiation results from the helical motion of extremely relativistic electrons around the field lines of the galactic magnetic field ( see , for instance @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the electron angular velocity    @xmath68    is determined by the ratio between @xmath69 , the component of the magnetic field orthogonal to the particle velocity , and @xmath70 , the electron energy . as it moves around the magnetic field lines the electron radiates .",
    "a)_single electron _",
    "until the electron velocity is small ( @xmath71 ) we speak of cyclotron radiation : the electron behaves as a rigid dipole which rotates with gyrofrequency ( [ gyr1 ] ) in a plane orthogonal to the magnetic field direction and emits a single line . the radiation has a dumbell spatial distribution ( see fig.[f3 ] ) : @xmath72 is circularly polarized along the dumbell axis ( @xmath73 ) and linearly polarized in directions orthogonal to it ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "when the electron velocity increases the radiation field changes until at @xmath75 , ( @xmath70 @xmath76 ) it assumes the peculiar charachters of synchrotron radiation :    i)radiated power proportional to @xmath70 @xmath77 and @xmath78 ,    ii)continous frequency spectrum , peaked around : @xmath79    ( @xmath80 is the angle between the velocity vector @xmath81 and the wave vector @xmath82 , see fig.[f4 ] ) .",
    "the peak is so narrow that in a given direction the emission is practically monochromatic ,    iii)radiation almost entirely emitted in a narrow cone ) of the cyclotron dumbbell beam , seen by a fast moving observer ( @xmath75 ) becomes a cone folded around the direction of movement ] of aperture ( see fig.[f5 ] ) @xmath83    around the forward direction of the electron motion . inside the cone",
    "( @xmath84 ) the frequency is maximum and equal to @xmath85 in the opposite direction ( @xmath86 ) intensity and frequency are sharply reduced .",
    "iv)radiation 100 @xmath87 linearly polarized at the surface of the cone.inside the cone the linear polarization is still dominant but a small fraction of circular polarization exists , ( @xmath88 and @xmath89 ) . outside the cone the very small fraction of radiation produced is elliptically polarized and becomes circularly polarized when seen along the @xmath69 direction .",
    "so the stokes parameters depend on @xmath90 , the angle @xmath91 between @xmath90 and the line of sight , and the dimensionless frequency @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the so called _ critical frequency _ , @xcite,@xcite , itself function of @xmath90 ( see eq.[gyr1 ] ) .",
    "b)_cloud of monoenergetic electrons _    when the effects of many monoenergetic electrons with uniform distribution of pitch angles are combined , @xmath94 and @xmath23 are reinforced ( the stokes parameters are additive ) while @xmath24 is erased .",
    "in fact    @xmath95    where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are constants , @xmath98 and @xmath99 almost monochromatic functions of @xmath100 , and @xmath26 the angle between the projection of the magnetic vector on the observer plane and an axis on that plane ( the projection of the magnetic vector on the observer plane is the minor axis of the polarization ellipse ) . if inside the emitting cloud the magnetic field",
    "varies , also @xmath26 varies , therefore @xmath101 and @xmath102 must be averaged along the line of sight across the cloud . in conclusion",
    "the degree of polarization @xmath103 varies between a maximum value , ( uniform magnetic field ) and zero ( magnetic field randomly distributed ) .",
    "c)_electrons with power law energy spectrum _    in the interstellar medium the radiating particles are the cosmic ray electrons whose energy spectrum : @xmath104    is a power law ( see for instance @xcite , @xcite ) and references therein ) with spectral index @xmath105 and space density proportional to @xmath106 . because the emission of a single electron is practically monochromatic",
    "the resulting radiation spectrum is a power law : @xmath107 with intensity spectral index @xmath108 , temperature spectral index @xmath109 and @xmath110 a slow function of @xmath111 @xcite .",
    "( if the magnetic field is not uniform we use @xmath112 instead of @xmath69 and a slightly different function @xmath113 ) .",
    "the stokes parameters are products of the intensity @xmath114 , the degree of polarization @xmath103 and @xmath101 or @xmath102 , therefore we can write : @xmath115    where @xmath116 is a constant whose value depends on @xmath111 and the distribution of the magnetic field along the integration path .    when the medium inside the synchrotron source , or in the medium where radiation propagates , is permeated by thermal electrons faraday rotation modifies the polarization charachteristics of the radiation .",
    "in fact by faraday effect , when the radiation crosses a region of thickness @xmath117 permeated by magnetic fields and thermal electrons with density @xmath118 , the angle of polarization of the radiation rotates by an angle ( see for instance @xcite ) @xmath119    inside the source this brings depolarization , because radiation produced at different points along @xmath117 suffers different rotations .",
    "additional depolarization inside the source comes about when the magnetic field along @xmath117 is not uniform because in eqs.([spec2])we have to use @xmath120 and @xmath121 instead of @xmath102 and @xmath101 .",
    "so the degree of polarization at the source @xmath103 varies between 0 ( random magnetic field distribution ) and : @xmath122 ( uniform magnetic field and faraday rotation absent ) .    outside the source the angle of polarization rotates by farday effect so the stokes parameter of the synchrotron radiation @xmath123 and @xmath124 measaured by an earth observer are different from the stokes parameters at the source .    a regular trend of the magnetic field inside and outside the source is insufficient to guarantee a regular trend of the spatial distribution of @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "in fact as the line of sight moves among adjacent points on the sky @xmath118 , @xmath125 and @xmath117 fluctuate .",
    "so also the angle of faraday rotation @xmath126 fluctuates by a quantity @xmath127 ^ 2 ~+~ [ < n_e > \\delta(l)]^2\\}^{1/2 }",
    "~\\simeq~cost~\\lambda^2~l~\\delta(n_e ) \\end{array}\\ ] ]    proportional to @xmath117 .",
    "because l is at least tens or hundred of pc @xmath128 can be very large .",
    "besides this effect produced by faraday rotation , when we look in different directions through the interstellar medium @xmath123 and @xmath124 may change also because @xmath90 , @xmath129 , @xmath111 , @xmath130 and @xmath106 vary ( see for instance @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "is a nonzero mean , nonzero variance variable ; @xmath131 and @xmath132 are zero mean , nonzero variance variables ]    we conclude that angle and degree of polarization of the synchrotron radiation fluctuates when the line of sight moves among adjacent regions on the sky , a conclusion supported by recent observations which show that the spatial distribution of the polarized component of the synchrotron radiation at intermediate and small angular scales is highly structured . on maps we see in fact lines ( _ channels _ ) along which @xmath103 goes to zero and sudden rotations of the plane of polarization when the line of sight goes from a side to the other of a channel @xcite .",
    "we expect therefore that at small and intermediate angular scales @xmath123 and @xmath124 are stochastic functions of the direction of observations so we can write :    @xmath133    exceptions to this behaviour can be expected when along the line of sight there are peculiar regions characterized by special field configurations and/or by large densities of thermal electrons , like in the well known loops and spurs or in hii regions , where systematic effects overcome random effects .",
    "nature and origin of these features , clearly visible on brouw and spoelstra maps of the polarized component of the galactic background @xcite , are discussed for instance by @xcite .",
    "usually these regions are close to the observer and have large angular dimensions , so their effects can be removed if one evaluates the angular power spectrum of the radiation distribution and limits his analysis to angular scales below few degrees ( multipole order @xmath134 ) .",
    "being aware that this is a very important issue we tested its validity analyzing the distribution of the measured values of @xmath22 and @xmath23 on maps extracted from the effelsberg survey ( @xcite and @xcite ) of the diffuse radio emission .",
    "we found ( see appendix 2 ) that up to angular scales of 5 degrees ( l close to 36 ) the difference @xmath135 is fully consistent with zero .    because of eq .",
    "( [ main ] ) if @xmath136 also @xmath137 , so the synchrotron radiation has both electric and magnetic modes : @xmath138    and ( see eqs .",
    "( [ syn1 ] ) and ( [ main ] ) ) : @xmath139",
    "in a homogeneous and isotropic universe only temperature and intensity @xmath140 change as the universe expands : both decrease adiabatically . because this is true for @xmath10 and @xmath11 separately , we do not expect anisotropy nor polarization therefore @xmath141 and @xmath142 are natural consequences .    on the contrary , inhomogeneities and perturbations of matter density or of gravitational field , induce anisotropy and polarization of the cmb . at",
    "the recombination epoch linear polarization appears as a by product of the thomson scattering of the cmb on the free electrons of the primordial plasma .",
    "the polarizarion tensor it gives can be calculated solving the boltzman transfer equations of the radiation in a nonstationary plasma permeated by a variable and inhomogeneous gravitational field @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the gravitational field is made of a background field , with homogeneous and isotropic frw metric , and an inhomogeneous and variable mix of waves : density fluctuations , velocity fluctuations , and gravitational waves . because of their transformation laws these waves are also said scalar , vector and tensor perturbations , respectively .",
    "scalar ( density ) perturbations affect the gravitational field , the density of matter and its velocity distribution .",
    "they were discovered studying the matter distribution in our universe on scales from @xmath143 mpc to @xmath144 mpc .",
    "it is firmly believed they are the seeds of the large scale structure of the universe and are reflected by the large scale cmb anisotropy detected for the first time at the beginning of the  90s @xcite , @xcite .",
    "their existence is predicted by the great majority of models of the early universe .",
    "observation shows that the effects of these perturbations are small , so we can treat them as small variations @xmath145 ,",
    "@xmath146 , @xmath147 of @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath148 . introducing the auxiliary functions @xmath149 and @xmath130 : @xmath150    ( @xmath91 is the angle between the line of sight and the wave vector ) for plane waves the boltzman equations ( see for instance @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and reference therein ) become :    @xmath151    where @xmath98 is the gravitational force which drives both anisotropy and polarization , @xmath152 is the thomson cross - section , @xmath118 is the density of free electrons , and @xmath153 the scale factor .",
    "these equations give : @xmath154    where @xmath155 is the optical depth of the region where the phenomenon occurs .",
    "rotating the coordinate system we can generate a new pair of stokes parameters ( @xmath156 ) : no matter which is the system of reference we choose these parameters satisfy the symmetry parity condition .    because there is always a system in which @xmath157 and @xmath158 , we may conclude that , in a system dominated by the primordial density perturbations ( see , for instance @xcite ) magnetic modes of the cmb polarization vanish and only electric modes exist @xcite . therefore : @xmath159 where index @xmath160 stays for _ density perturbation_.      vector perturbations , associated to rotational effects , perturb only velocity and gravitational field .",
    "they are not predicted by the inflation theory and it is common believe that they do not contribute to the anisotropy and polarization of the cmb .      gravitational waves ( tensor modes ) and gravitational lensing of large scale structures of the universe induce b modes in the distribution of cmbp(see for instance @xcite ) ) .",
    "gravitational lensing gives a power spectrum at least an order of magnitude below the power spectrum of the e mode polarized signal produced by scalar perturbations , with a maximum at @xmath161 .",
    "the power spectrum of the b mode polarization produced by gravity waves is maximun at @xmath162 , is definitely below the power spectrum produced by gravitational lensing for @xmath163 and only at very large angular scales ( @xmath164 ) it may be comparable to the scalar e modes .       if one excludes very large angular scales we may conclude that cmbp is dominated by e - modes .",
    "b - modes are just a contamination by b - modes at levels of @xmath165 or less .",
    "the cmb radiation we receive is mixed with foregrounds of local origin .",
    "when the anisotropy of the cmb was detected , to remove the foregrounds from maps of the diffuse radiation , data were reorganized in the following way : @xmath166    where @xmath167 , is a two dimension vector ( map ) which gives the total signal measured at different points @xmath168 on the sky , @xmath169 the noise vector , @xmath170 the matrix which combines the components @xmath171 of the signal . at each point",
    "@xmath168 we can in fact write : @xmath172    where @xmath173 are weights , given by @xmath174 , @xmath175 is the synchrotron component , @xmath176 the free - free emission component , @xmath177 the dust contribution and so on . using just one map the signal components can not be disentangled .",
    "if however one has maps of the same region of sky made at different frequencies it is possible to write a system of equations . provided the number of maps and equations is sufficient , the system can be solved and the components of @xmath178 separated , breaking the degeneracy .",
    "we end up with a map of @xmath179 which can be used to estimate the cmb anisotropy .",
    "when we look for polarization at each point on the sky we measure tensors instead of scalar quantities , therefore to disentangle the polarized components of the cmb we need a greater number of equations . here",
    "we will concentrate on the separation of the two dominant components of the polarized diffuse radiation : galactic synchrotron ( plus dust ) foreground and cmbp .      instead of observing the same region of sky at many frequencies , we suggest a different approach .",
    "it takes advantage of the differences between the statistical properties of the two most important components of the polarized diffuse radiation ( cmb ( background ) and synchrotron ( foreground ) radiation ) and does not require multifrequency maps .",
    "we define the estimator : @xmath181 where @xmath182 and @xmath183 ( here and in the following indexes @xmath184 or @xmath185 stay for _ synchrotron _ and cmb , respectively ) .    because    * @xmath51 and @xmath52 modes of synchrotron do not correlate each other neither correlate with the cmb modes + @xmath186 , + @xmath187 , * @xmath188 * @xmath189    where indexes @xmath160 and @xmath190 stay for @xmath191 ( or @xmath192 ) and @xmath193 perturbation , respectively .",
    "@xmath180 gives an estimate of the e - mode excess in maps of the polarized diffuse radiation .",
    "if tensor perturbations are negligible this excess is the cmbp signal .",
    "if tensor perturbations are important the excess is a lower limit with a systematic difference from the true value which in the worst condition ( maximum contribution to cmbp from gravitational waves and gravitational lensing ) reaches a maximum value of @xmath165 .",
    "let  s now consider the angular power spectrum of @xmath180 . for multipole @xmath66",
    "we can write : @xmath194    where @xmath195 and @xmath196 are random variables with gaussian distribution @xmath197 ( see eqs.([gauss1 ] ) and ( [ gauss2 ] ) in appendix a ) .",
    "according the ergodic theorem ( in the limit of infinite maps , the average over 2d space is equivalent to the average over realisations ) the average value of @xmath198 is equal to the difference of the average values of @xmath195 and @xmath196 summed over @xmath67 . taking into account equation ( [ gauss2 ] ) we can therefore write : @xmath199    where : ) is an explicit form of the average of the stochastic variables @xmath200 and @xmath201 over a probability density @xmath197 , the short form being triangle brackets ]    @xmath202    comparing eq.([coco ] ) with the ordinary definition of multipole coefficients : @xmath203 we can write : @xmath204      for synchrotron radiation @xmath205 should be zero , non zero for density perturbations , but on real maps it is always different from zero .",
    "in fact a map is just a realization of a stochastic process and the amplitudes of @xmath195 and @xmath196 , averaged over 2d sphere , have uncertainties which add quadratically , so @xmath206 even in the case of synchrotron polarization .",
    "this effect , very similar to the well known _ cosmic variance _ of anisotropy @xcite , @xcite ( the real universe is just a realisation of a stochastic process , therefore there will be always a difference between the realization we measure and the expectation value ) does not vanish if observations are repeated .       the variance of @xmath198 is @xmath207    the quantities @xmath58 and @xmath59 , being sums over @xmath67 of @xmath208 stochastic values with gaussian distribution , have a @xmath209 distribution with @xmath210 degrees of freedom , so their variance is    @xmath211    more explicitly @xmath212 when the synchrotron foreground is dominant ( @xmath213 ) @xmath214    in agreement with ( [ var1 ] ) .      the synchrotron foreground is a sort of _ system noise _ which hampers the detection of the _ signal _ , the cmb polarization . at frequencies sufficiently high ( above @xmath215 ghz ,",
    "see next section ) the noise is small compared to the signal therefore direct detection of cmbp is possible . at low frequencies on the contrary",
    "the cmbp signal is buried in the noise created by synchrotron and dust emission . in this case to recognize the presence of the cmb polarization we can use our estimator @xmath180 .    at angular scale @xmath66 , to be detectable the cmbp must satisfy the condition    @xmath216    where @xmath217 are the coefficients of the multipole expansion of the @xmath51 modes and @xmath218 is the confindence level of the signal detectability . in a similar way we can write for our estimator : @xmath219 where @xmath220    if one neglects tensor perturbations ( @xmath221 ) the criterium for the cmbp detection becomes @xmath222    so by @xmath180 we get the cmbp level with an uncertainty  @xmath223 which decreases as @xmath66 and the angular resolution increase",

    "the angular power spectra of the polarized component of the synchrotron radiation have been studied by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite using the few partial maps of the polarized diffuse radiation available in literature .",
    "it appears that the power spectra of the degree of polarization @xmath103 and of electric and magnetic modes @xmath51 and @xmath52 follow power laws of @xmath66 up to @xmath225 . for the degree of polarization",

    "at lower value of @xmath66 definite differences exist between the results obtained by @xcite and by @xcite : these differences must be understood , but they are not important here because our statistical method can not be used for small values of @xmath66 when the number of samples becomes insufficient to carry on statistical analyses . for high values of @xmath66 , if one excludes extrapolations and models ( eg . @xcite ) , there are no data in literature , but this is not a limitation because for large values of @xmath66 the results of our method are practically independent from the spectral index .",
    "all the above authors got their results analyzing low frequency data ( 1.4 , 2.4 and 2.7 ghz ) , therefore the extension of their spectra to tens of ghz , the region where cmb observations are usually made , depend on the accuracy of @xmath130 , the temperature spectral index of the galactic synchrotron radiation .",

    "last but not least many of the values of @xmath130 in literature have been obtained measuring the total ( polarized plus unpolarized ) galactic emission . in absence of faraday effect @xmath243 and @xmath244 , the spectral indexes of the total , polarized and unpolarized components of the galactic emission , should be identical ( see eqs .",
    "( [ spec1]),([spec2 ] ) ) .",
    "however when faraday effect with its @xmath245 frequency dependence is present , we expect that , as frequency increases , the measured value of the degree of polarization ( se eq .",
    "( [ degreep ] ) ) increases , up to @xmath246    therefore we should observe @xmath247 .",
    "the expected differences are however well inside the error bars of the data in literature so at present we can neglect them and assume @xmath248 .    instead of extrapolating low frequency results it would be better to look for direct observations of the galactic emission and its polarized component at higher frequencies . unfortunately above 5 ghz observations of the galactic synchrotron spectrum and its distribution are rare and incomplete . at 33 ghz observations by @xcite",
    "give at some patches on the sky a galactic temperature of about @xmath249 from which follows that at the same frequency we can expect polarized foreground signals up to several @xmath250 . at 14.5 ghz observations made at ovro @xcite give synchrotron signals of 175 @xmath250 , equivalent to about 15 @xmath250 at 33 ghz of which up to 10 @xmath250 can be polarized .",
    "in conclusion there are large uncertainties on the frequency above which observations of the cmbp are practically unaffected by the polarized component of the galactic diffuse emission .",
    "to be on the safe side we can set it at 50 ghz ( see for instance @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) . above 50 ghz cmbp",
    "definitely overcomes the polarized synchrotron foreground .",
    "below 50 ghz contamination by the galactic emission can be important but its evaluation , usually made by multifrequency observations , is dubious .",
    "this conclusion is supported by figure [ f9 ] where we plotted , versus the multipole order @xmath66 , the power spectra of cmbp and galactic synchrotron at 43 ghz .",
    "the cmb spectrum has been calculated by cmbfast @xcite assuming standard cosmological conditions ( cmb power spectrum normalized to the cobe data at low @xmath66 , @xmath251 , @xmath252 , @xmath253 , @xmath254 , @xmath255 km / sec / mpc , @xmath256 , @xmath257 , standard recombination ) .",
    "the synchrotron spectrum has been calculated assuming for @xmath258 and @xmath259 the scaling law ( [ synebb ] ) with @xmath260 ( most pessimistic case ) , @xmath261 and @xmath262 respectively .",
    "it appears that at 43 ghz the cmb power is comparable to the synchrotron power only at very small angular scales ( @xmath263 ) .",
    "similar calculations at other frequencies confirm that only above @xmath0 ghz and at small angular scales ( large values of @xmath66 ) the cmbp power spectrum overcomes the synchrotron spectrum . below @xmath0 ghz direct detection of the cmbp is almost impossible even at small angular scale .       to overcome this limit we can use our estimator . to see how it improves the cmbp detectability we calculated the angular power spectrum of @xmath264 , the estimator we expect when the diffuse radiation is dominated by synchrotron radiation . from eqs.([multipole ] ) , ( [ dl21 ] ) and ( [ synebb ] ) we get :    @xmath265    a quantity which can be directly compared with the power spectrum of cmbp .",
    "in fact eqs.([aed ] ) , ( [ d1 ] ) , ( [ equal ] ) and ( [ dl20 ] ) show that the power spectrum @xmath266 of the estimator evaluated when the sky is dominated by cmbp density perturbations coincides with the power spectrum of cmbp produced by density perturbations .",
    "figure [ fd ] shows at 37 ghz the power spectra at 37 ghz of : i)@xmath264 , the estimator for a sky dominated by galactic synchrotron ( solid line , calculated using eq.([synebb ] ) ) , ii)@xmath266 , the estimator for a sky dominated by cmbp .",
    "it coincides with the power spectrum of cmbp ( dotted line , calculated as in figure [ f9 ] with cmbfast using the same standard cosmological conditions ) , iii)the power spectrum of the polarized component of the galactic synchrotron radiation ( dashed line , calculated using eq.([synebb ] ) ) . as expected at 37 ghz",
    "the cmbp power is well below the synchrotron power , therefore direct observations of cmbp are impossible ( the maximum value of the cmbp power is about 2.5 times below the synchrotron power at the same @xmath66 ) .",
    "however above @xmath267 the power of the synchrotron estimator is definitely below the power of the cmbp estimator : at @xmath268 the ratio cmbp / d is maximum and close to @xmath269 .",
    "this confirms that the use of @xmath180 allows to recognize the cmbp also at frequencies well below 50 ghz .",
    "to further test the capability of our estimator we studied the separation of cmb and galactic synchrotron using measured instead of expected values of @xmath198.the measurements were simulated by random numbers , with gaussian distribution @xmath270 , zero mean and unity variance ( see eqs ( [ gauss1 ] ) - ( [ gauss2 ] ) ) .",
    "two series of @xmath208 random numbers gave representations of @xmath271 and @xmath272 respectively and from them we obtained @xmath198 ( see eq.([dest ] ) ) .",
    "then , to take into account that real data are collected with a finite angular resolution ( e.g. boomerang data come from regions whose angular extension is equivalent to @xmath273 @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) we averaged the above values of @xmath198 on intervals @xmath274 : @xmath275    figure [ f6 ] , figure [ f7 ] and figure [ f8 ] show @xmath276 ( the sign of @xmath198 is arbitrary ) versus @xmath66 , for @xmath277 , @xmath278 and @xmath279 respectively : the very large fluctuations of the estimator are drastically reduced as soon as @xmath280 increases .",
    "figure [ f10 ] , figure [ f11 ] and figure [ f12 ] are similar to figure [ fd ] . here , instead of the expectation value , we plot simulated measurements of @xmath264 at 37 ghz , for @xmath277 ( figure [ f10 ] ) , @xmath281 ( figure [ f11 ] ) and @xmath279 ( figure [ f12 ] ) , respectively .",
    "once again the cmbp power spectrum comes from cmbfast assuming the same cosmological conditions we assumed above .",
    "the synchrotron power spectrum is obtained from eq.([synebb ] ) with @xmath282 ( most pessimistic condition ) .",
    "figure [ f13 ] shows at 17 ghz the same quantities we plotted in figure [ f12 ] . for a better appreciation of the differences among the three curves , on the vertical axis here we use a logarithmic scale .",
    "the power spectrum of the estimator now almost touches the two highest peaks of the cmbp spectrum .",
    "probably 17 ghz is the lowest frequency at which , in the most favorable conditions , one can use @xmath198 . in the most pessimistic case ( @xmath260 and @xmath283 )",
    "the corresponding frequency is 25 ghz .",
    "we analyzed the impact of the real world experimental conditions on our method for disentangling cmbp and foregrounds in maps of the polarized diffuse radiation .",
    "a polarimeter is a two channel system which ( by hardware and/or software methods ) splits the sky signal in two polarized components , send them to separate channels where they are amplified and then looks for correlations between the two components .",
    "the system outputs are proportional to a pair of stokes parameters ( e.g. @xmath23 and @xmath22 ) , or to the electric and magnetic modes @xmath58 and @xmath59 or to a combination of them , e.g. our estimator @xmath180 .",
    "unfortunately as the signals propagate through the system , noise is added to them so at the system output the signal is mixed to noise .",
    "moreover if the channels are asymmetric or there are cross talks between them , the outputs contain additional signals which simulate spurious polarization , usually an offset of the system output from the level one should expect with an ideal system when polarization is absent ( for a discussion see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "so in the real world the signal we are looking for , @xmath284 , is accompanied by uncorrelated noise and offset .",
    "what one measures is @xmath285 where @xmath286 , @xmath287 is the cross talk coefficient , @xmath288 the noise signal and @xmath289 the noise standard deviation . in commercial systems",
    "@xmath290 while in dedicated cmbp experiments values of @xmath291 have been obtained @xcite . by accurate choice of the system components we can therefore minimize the offset and",
    "further reduce it by phase modulation techniques ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    at this point",
    "we have noisy maps we can use to evaluate @xmath180 and its power spectrum instead of @xmath23 and @xmath22 or @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "as shown by the above simulation the signal / noise ratio for @xmath180 is definitely better than the signal / noise ratio for the stokes parameters or @xmath58 or @xmath292 and brings it to values similar to the ones we find when studying weak radiosources or , in the worst situation , the cmb anisotropy .",
    "from here we can therefore go on and extract @xmath180 from the remaining noise using the well known methods of time integration , commonly used in radioastronomy .",
    "observations of the cmb polarization are hampered by the presence of a foreground , the polarized component of the galactic synchrotron radiation . only above @xmath293",
    "the cosmic signal definitely overcomes the galactic synchrotron and direct measurements of the cmbp are possible . between @xmath294 ghz and @xmath215 ghz",
    "background and foreground are comparable .",
    "below @xmath295 ghz the polarized sky is dominated by the galactic signal .",
    "so when measurements are made at ground observatories where atmospheric absorption prevent observations above @xmath296 ghz , all programs for cmbp measurements must include observing and analysis strategies for disentangling the galactic synchrotron signals from the cmbp signals .",
    "a common approach is fitting models of the intensity , frequency dependence and spatial distribution of the cosmic and galactic signals to multifrequency maps of the polarized diffuse radiation .",
    "or , when observation are made at one frequency , looking for additional data in literature , but here the accuracy of the available data is insufficient to get firm evaluations of cmbp .    in this paper",
    "we presented a different approach which at small angular scales ( @xmath297 ( @xmath298 ) ) and down to frequencies as low as @xmath299 ( @xmath300 in the most favorable conditions ) allows to extract the cmbp signal from single frequency maps of the polarized diffuse radiation .",
    "it takes advantage of the different statistical properties of the spatial distributions of cmbp and polarized galactic synchrotron . by our estimator @xmath180 , which evaluates the difference between e- and b - modes , we get the polarized component of cmb with a maximum systematic (",
    "underestimate ) uncertainty of @xmath165 .",
    "this uncertainty is set by the contamination by the tensor perturbations which add b - modes to a cmbp map dominated by the e - modes generated by scalar(density ) perturbations .",
    "improving our knowledge of the tensor perturbations we will reduce the above uncertainty and improve the accuracy of our method of measuring cmbp .",
    "the accuracy we can get with our method is the maximun one can obtain at ground observatories with today ( 2nd generation ) systems for measuring the cmb polarization .",
    "these 2nd generation experiments are just arrived on the verge of detecting the polarized signals produced by density perturbations ( see for instance @xcite and @xcite).direct observations of the signals associated to tensor perturbations requires new , 3rd generation , intrinsically able to reject the foreground signals which , at present , are still in preparation ( see for instance @xcite ) .",

    "mvs acknowledges the osservatorio astronomico di capodimonte , inaf , for hospitality during preparation of this paper .",
    "here and overall in paper we suppose that @xmath301 are complex random variables which satisfy the probability distribution law : @xmath302    with variance @xmath303 and @xmath304 .",
    "they have all the propertiers of gaussian variables ( below we omitt indexes @xmath51 and @xmath52 in first and second equations ) :    @xmath305    @xmath306    setting @xmath307    with current index @xmath51 or @xmath52 , it immediately follows : @xmath308",
    "in the our paper we assert that for the galactic synchrotron emission the measured values of the stokes parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 behave as stochastic variables and random fields with gaussian distribution .",
    "this statement certainly holds at high galactic latitudes . at low galactic latitudes , where we observe large scale galactic structures , regular magnetic fields @xcite and quasi - periodic structures with typical sizes of about 250 pc , ( the amplitudes of regular and irregular components are approximately equal )",
    "this assumption has to be checked .    to do it we analyzed the distribution of the measured values of @xmath22 and @xmath23 on regions of different extension extracted from the effelsberg maps of the polarized diffuse radiation @xcite .",
