    "the prevalence of a substantial degree of homogeneity in o / h over the izw18 galaxy can constrain its chemical history , suggesting an overall enrichment phase previous to the current burst .",

    "physical - chemical properties of the ionized gas were derived from these selected region spectra . in the three bpt diagrams , all the integrated regions fall within the area corrresponding to hii - like ionization .",
    "putting together the spatially resolved measurements and integrated ones of o / h , we find that the izw18 integrated spectrum - o / h concurs with the representative metallicity of izw18 defined here , and can be taken to describe the abundance of the ionized gas of izw18 as a whole .",
