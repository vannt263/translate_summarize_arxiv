    "diffuse intracluster luminosity @xcite and other faint surface - brightness features detected at large distances from the center of isolated and cluster galaxies @xcite may provide a valuable record of the mechanisms that led to the assembly and formation of the cosmic structures at the different hierarchical scales .",
    "stellar streams , like the case of sgr and cma in the milky way ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and `` runaway '' halo stars @xcite are , in this sense , excellent examples of the effect of galaxy tidal interactions and dynamical relaxation processes , that spread stars well outside the bright body of their parent systems .",
    "furthermore , the evidence of quiescent on - going star formation in low - density environments , such as dwarf or very low surface - brightness galaxies @xcite , indicates that the transition between coherent stellar systems and diffuse background might be not so sharp .    in this framework",
    ", the study of planetary nebulae ( pne ) is of special interest as these objects are efficient tracers of their underlying parent stellar population even in those regions where the stellar plot is too faint to be detected against the night - sky brightness @xcite .",
    "relying on standard narrow - band imagery , pne have been confidently detected out to 70  kpc from the center of cen  a @xcite and other bright galaxies in the virgo and fornax clusters , about 15  mpc away @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , optimized multi - slit imaging recently pushed this distance limit even farther , reaching the coma cluster pne , at about 100  mpc distance @xcite .",
    "one open question in this approach is the link between the size of the pn component and the sampled ( bolometric ) luminosity of its parent stellar population .",
    "this ratio , often referred to in the literature as the `` luminosity - specific pn number density '' or , shortly , the `` @xmath0 ratio '' @xcite , provides the amount of light associated to any observed pn sample , and it is the first assumption when using pne as tracers of the spatial distribution and motions of the parent stars .",
    "observationally , there is strong evidence for @xmath0 to correlate with galaxy color , the reddest ellipticals being a factor 5 to 7 poorer in pne per unit galaxy luminosity than spirals @xcite .",
    "this trend is at odds with a nearly `` universal '' pn luminosity function ( pnlf ) , as observed for galaxies along the whole hubble morphological sequence @xcite .",
    "population synthesis models offer a useful reference tool , in this regard , as they allow us to probe the theoretical relationship of @xmath0 with the different distinctive parameters of a stellar population , thus overcoming most of the observational uncertainties related to systematic bias , incomplete sampling etc .. in addition , a theoretical assessment of the @xmath0 ratio does not require , in principle , any exact knowledge of the pnlf , still largely uncertain at its faint magnitudes @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we want to study the luminosity - specific pn number density from a more general approach based on a new set of stellar population models .",

    "our predictions for the @xmath0 ratio will also be compared with the observed pn population of local group galaxies , in order to validate our adopted scenario for post - asymptotic giant branch ( pagb ) evolution .",
    "we will also address the puzzling problem of the poorer pn population in elliptical galaxies @xcite : this very interesting feature might be the signature of a phase transition related to horizontal branch ( hb ) evolution , with important consequences on the expected ultraviolet evolution of galaxies and other stellar systems in metal - rich environments .",

    "the ssp theory developed by ( * ? ? ? * hereafter rb86 ) and @xcite allows us to compute the value of @xmath0 for a coeval and chemically homogeneous stellar aggregate . assuming a standard power - law imf such as @xmath12 , the expected number of stars that populate the",

    "because the ms luminosity contribution increases , the absolute amount of `` fuel '' burnt by pms stars increases ( cf .",

    "this quantity depends both on the chemio - dynamical properties of the ejected material , giving rise to the nebular envelope , and on the stellar core - mass evolution , which is responsible for the `` firing up '' of the nebular gas .",

    "we shall discuss the implication of an inhibited agb phase on pn evolution in what follows .",
    "the ifmr can be derived empirically from the mass estimate of observed white dwarfs in nearby open clusters ( like hyades or praesepe ) , coupled with the value of @xmath23 and cluster age , as obtained from isochrone fit of the cluster c - m diagram .",
    "quoting @xcite , there is evidence that observed white dwarf masses , for low- and intermediate - mass stars , `` coincide almost exactly with the new theoretical predictions of the core masses at the beginning of the thermal pulsing agb '' ( @xmath54 ) .",

    "when applied to ellipticals , this argument could place a quite tight constraint to the overall bs luminosity contribution , and the size of the induced pn progeny , in order to avoid unrealistically bluer galaxy colors . for example , if we take the case of cluster m  67 ( the praesepe ) as a reference , bss are found to supply @xmath104% of the total @xmath105 luminosity @xcite , causing a @xmath106  mag shift to the integrated cluster color @xcite . converting these values to bolometric luminosities ( e.g.  by relying on our discussion in sec .",
    "[ bolcol ] ) , this implies that bs contribution must be _ well below _",
    "@xmath107% of the total galaxy luminosity if we wish to avoid any measurable effect on the integrated optical colors of ellipticals .",
    "in addition , if @xmath90 pne in ellipticals really stem from bs evolution , then one consequence is that the value of @xmath0 for these galaxies , as extrapolated from the observation of the very brightest nebulae alone , could sensibly overestimate the population of `` standard '' ( i.e.  single - star ) pne of lower core mass . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : scale ] ) , this would imply an even shorter mean lifetime for single - star nebulae , thus enforcing the importance of the case _",
    "( ii ) _ and _ ( iii ) _ evolutionary channels .",
    "if two pn sub - populations of bright ( coalesced ) pne and fainter nebulae generated from standard evolution of low - mass stars really coexist in early - type galaxies , then one might wonder whether they also display any distinctive dynamical signature , as the recent case of ngc  4697 @xcite seem to suggest .    to complete the discussion of fig .",
    "[ uvcol ] , we now focus on two major outliers in the plot , namely ngc  205 and ngc  1316 . the first case can easily be assessed as this m  31 dwarf satellite is known to undergo active star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and its strong ultraviolet emission ( as well as its exceedingly low mg@xmath10 index , see table  [ e - sample ] ) is in fact the result of young ( a few @xmath108  yr ) ms stars .",
    "more special attention , instead , must be paid to the case of ngc  1316 ( fornax a ) .",
    "together with ngc  5128 ( cen a ) , ngc  1316 is known as one of the best established examples of `` mergers '' among early - type systems @xcite .",
    "the study of these two galaxies may therefore lead to a preliminary assessment of the influence of `` active '' galaxy environments on the pn population .",
    "the location of both objects in the @xmath73 plot of fig .",
    "[ sigma ] places them at the extreme _ ( both highest and lowest ) _ values of @xmath0 ; furthermore , one must also report the peculiar location of ngc  1316 in the mg@xmath10 plot ( fig .",
    "[ mg2 ] ) , which shows a severe pn deficiency when comparing for instance with ngc  4382 , of similar mass and metallicity .",
    "data for ngc  5128 prevents a similar comparison for this galaxy . ]",
    "regarding the ultraviolet properties of these `` merger templates '' , the upper limit to the 1540    flux for ngc  5128 , as reported by the ned database , suggests a presumably very `` red '' uv color for this galaxy , such as @xmath109 , in line with the observations of ngc  1316 .",
    "definitely , in spite of similar observed spectrophotometric properties ( i.e  @xmath110 , @xmath111 and , likely , the @xmath74 color , cf . table  [ e - sample ] ) , it remains difficult to understand the role of galaxy merging mechanisms that led , for cen  a and for  a , to such a dramatically different behaviour in terms of pn population .",
    "wide - field ccd detectors , and accurate selection criteria based on h@xmath0 and [ oiii ] narrow - band photometry , allow a systematic survey of the pn population both in the milky way and in external galaxies .",
    "deep observations now explore the pn luminosity function several magnitudes below the bright cut - off , as recently achieved in the smc @xcite .",
    "the corresponding developments in the theoretical modeling help in clarifying the main physical mechanisms that constrain the nebular properties , especially those related to shell dynamics ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and chemical composition @xcite , although a clear understanding of the the pnlf at bright and low magnitudes is still to come .",
    "one open question deals with the empirical evidence for a nearly constant absolute magnitude of the pnlf bright cut - off ( @xmath90 ) , which makes bright pne effective standard candles for the intermediate cosmic distance scale ( @xmath112  mpc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this feature is not explained by the theoretical models , which predict @xmath90 to be a function of age , metallicity and other distinctive properties of the parent stellar population @xcite . in particular , this problem is stronger for elliptical galaxies , where a lower to mass for their stellar populations may hardly reconcile with the required presence of @xmath94 stellar progenitors for the @xmath90 nebulae @xcite .",
    "the pnlf faint - end tail is also subject to a substantial uncertainty , with observations showing a decrease in the number of pn at about 6  mag fainter than @xmath90 @xcite , and theory which predicts a distribution reaching magnitudes as faint as 8  mag below the pnlf bright cut - off .",
    "we have discussed in sec .",
    "[ lgcensus ] that our limited knowledge of the pnlf faint end reflects in a factor of two uncertainty on the estimated total number of nebulae for a given stellar system .",
    "the errors become larger for the most distant galaxies , external to the lg . in most cases ,",
    "the pnlf is only sampled in its brightest magnitude bin , and the observed pne number must be multiplied by a factor of 20 - 40 ( see table  [ lf ] ) to provide an estimate for the whole pn population .    despite these large uncertainties ,",
    "the study of the luminosity - specific pn number ( the so - called `` @xmath0 '' parameter in our discussion ) in external galaxies has allowed us to tackle the properties of the pn population in different environments , from dense bulge - dominated galaxies to very low density stellar populations such as those of the intracluster diffuse stellar component @xcite . from the theory presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : s2 ] and [ ell ] , there is a close _ liason _ between the value of @xmath0 and the pn visibility lifetime : as the specific evolutionary flux , @xmath27 , in eq .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) is nearly constant , then @xmath113 depending on the stellar core mass at the beginning of the agb phase , the value of @xmath35 must be compared with three relevant timescales that determine the pn evolution . as sketched in fig .",
    "[ sketch ] , they are the pagb core lifetime ( @xmath40 ) , the dynamical timescale for the nebula evaporation ( @xmath44 ) , and the transition time for the stellar core to leave the agb and reach the high - temperature regime required to trigger the nebula [ oiii ] emission ( @xmath67 ) . along the ssp evolution , mass loss eventually settles the absolute clock that links the @xmath20 evolution with the ssp age ( see sec .  [ mc ] ) .",
    "as far as core evolution provides the leading timescale for the pn visibility , standard mass loss theory _  la _",
    "@xcite predicts that @xmath20 ( and correspondingly @xmath0 ) _ should increase with ssp age_. , we have from @xcite that the final mass of pn nuclei roughly scales as @xmath114 , recalling that , to a first approximation , @xmath115 @xcite . according to footnote  [ nota1 ] , this eventually leads to @xmath116 . ]",
    "more generally , one would expect this to be the case of late - type galaxies , where star formation is on - going and a consistent fraction of high - mass stars is younger than a few gyr ( cf .",
    "[ alpha_ssp ] ) .",
    "as the fraction of young stars is higher in irregulars than in elliptical galaxies , and the integrated @xmath102 color becomes bluer along the e  @xmath117  i m hubble morphological sequence , then _",
    "one may conclude that lower values of @xmath0 are expected in bluer galaxies .",
    "_    however , observationally this does not occur for the lg galaxy population , as shown in fig .",
    "[ templates ] .",
    "in fact , while the suggested theoretical range for @xmath0 in the @xmath62 models matches the observations _ on average _ , the latter points to a constant behaviour with galaxy morphological type , with a typical rate between 1 and 6  pne per @xmath118  l@xmath119 . from these observations ,",
    "the inferred pn lifetime in lg spirals and irregulars should exceed 10000  yr , a value that requires the presence of a substantial fraction of stars with @xmath120 ( cf .",
    "[ mcr ] ) even in those galaxies with the most active star formation activity .",
    "the relatively low final mass and the tight mass range required by the `` dying '' stars in external galaxies find independent confirmation in the milky way , as also indicated by the observational evidence of the ifmr for local open clusters by @xcite .",
    "we have shown in sec .",
    "[ lgcensus ] that population synthesis models using this empirical ifmr produce a better fit ( both in absolute value and relative trend with galaxy morphological type ) for the correct value of pn density per unit galaxy luminosity in the lg galaxies , along the whole hubble morphological sequence ( see fig .",
    "[ templates ] ) .",
    "this result indicates that the dynamical evolution plays a central role in setting the overall pn observed properties as for low core - mass stars , the dynamical rather than nuclear timescale is the real driving parameter to constrain pn visibility ( see fig .",
    "[ sketch ] ) . as a consequence ,",
    "one may state that , _ rather than probing any real mass distribution of pagb stars , the pnlf basically tracks the time evolution of the expanding shell around stellar nuclei of nearly fixed mass _ @xcite .    within this picture ,",
    "one problem is related with the pn evolution in ( giant ) elliptical galaxies . here , the empirical evidence for a constant pnlf bright cut - off magnitude would require a sizable component of relatively high - mass stars , well above the to mass of @xmath121 expected for these old stellar systems .",
    "following @xcite , bs stars originating from coalesced close binary systems according to a classical evolutionary scheme @xcite , may possibly overcome the dilemma .",
    "however , if ellipticals do indeed host a bs population in a fraction similar to what we detect in old galactic open clusters , then galaxies should appear roughly 0.2  mag bluer than observed , in @xmath102 ( see fig .",
    "[ bs ] ) . as a consequence , from our arguments in sec .",
    "[ diagnostic ] , one is led to conclude that , in any case , bss can not provide much more than a few percent of galaxy bolometric luminosity and _ pne coming from the bs progeny must be confined to the very brightest bin of the pnlf , thus representing a marginal fraction of the global pn population . _    the relative lack of massive stars in early - type galaxies , and a high ( super - solar ? ) metallicity possibly easing a stronger mass loss in these galaxies , might actually lead to a larger component of blue hb stars , eventually evolving into low - mass pne . in sec .",
    "[ mcore ] , we have seen that for the low - mass cores ( @xmath68 ) , the increase in the transition time @xmath67 reduces effectively the visibility timescale of the nebula ( see , again fig .",
    "[ sketch ] ) , thus decreasing the value of @xmath0 .",
    "this trend is expected to depend on galaxy color ( or metallicity , as shown by the mg@xmath10 distribution of fig .",
    "[ mg2 ] ) with a lower pn density per unit galaxy luminosity for the redder ellipticals .",
    "furthermore , for the stellar component with @xmath8 , both hb and post - hb evolution occur at high temperature ( @xmath122",
    "k ) thus skipping the pn phase entirely @xcite .",
    "for these stars , the _ agb manqu _ evolution can effectively transfer some fraction of the pagb energy budget to the hot hb tail and affect the integrated galaxy sed . as a consequence",
    ", one may expect that the most uv - enhanced ellipticals display also the lowest values of @xmath0 .",
    "we have shown in sec .",
    "[ ell ] that such a tight correlation is observed for elliptical galaxies in the virgo cluster and other groups ( see fig .",
    "[ uvcol ] ) .",
    "recent hst observations of the resolved stellar population of m  32 and the bulge of m  31 @xcite further support this proposed scenario .",
    "the presence in our sample of two merger galaxies ( fornax  a and cen  a ) may provide the opportunity to study the effect of galaxy interactions on the pn population . based on the available data",
    "however , no firm conclusions can be drawn , although one has to remark that these two galaxies stand out as those with the most extreme ( both highest and lowest ) values of @xmath0 in our sample .",
    "perhaps such a huge variation in the galaxy pn population may be related to the disruptive effect of the intergalactic ram pressure , as recently considered by @xcite and @xcite .",

    "<S> we address the general problem of the luminosity - specific planetary nebula ( pn ) number , better known as the `` @xmath0 '' ratio , given by @xmath1 , and its relationship with age and metallicity of the parent stellar population . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis relies on population synthesis models , that account for simple stellar populations ( ssps ) , and more elaborated galaxy models covering the full star - formation range of the different hubble morphological types . </S>",
    "<S> this theoretical framework is compared with the updated census of the pn population in local group galaxies and external ellipticals in the leo group , and the virgo and fornax clusters .    </S>",
    "<S> the main conclusions of our study can be summarized as follows :    _ i ) _ according to the post - agb stellar core mass , pn lifetime in a ssp is constrained by three relevant regimes , driven by the nuclear ( @xmath2 ) , dynamical ( @xmath3 ) and transition ( @xmath4 ) timescales . </S>",
    "<S> the lower limit for @xmath5 also sets the minimum mass for stars to reach the agb thermal - pulsing phase and experience the pn event ;    _ ii ) _ mass loss is the crucial mechanism to constrain the value of @xmath0 , through the definition of the initial - to - final mass relation ( ifmr ) . </S>",
    "<S> the reimers mass - loss parameterization , calibrated on pop  ii stars of galactic globular clusters , poorly reproduces the observed value of @xmath0 in late - type galaxies , while a better fit is obtained using the empirical ifmr derived from white - dwarf observations in the galaxy open clusters ;    _ iii ) _ the inferred pn lifetime for local group spirals and irregulars exceeds 10000  yr , which suggests that @xmath6 cores dominate , throughout ;    _ iv ) _ the relative pn deficiency in elliptical galaxies , and the observed trend of @xmath0 with galaxy optical colors support the presence of a prevailing fraction of low - mass cores ( @xmath7 ) in the pn distribution , and a reduced visibility timescale for the nebulae as a consequence of the increased agb transition time . </S>",
    "<S> the stellar component with @xmath8 , which overrides the pn phase , could provide an enhanced contribution to hotter hb and post - hb evolution , as directly observed in m  32 and the bulge of m  31 . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the most uv - enhanced ellipticals should also display the lowest values of @xmath0 , as confirmed by the virgo cluster early - type galaxy population ;    _ v ) _ any blue - straggler population , invoked as progenitor of the @xmath9 pne in order to preserve the constancy of the bright luminosity - function cut - off magnitude in ellipticals , must be confined to a small fraction ( few percents at most ) of the whole galaxy pn population .    </S>",
