    "we would like to examine this picture more closely .",
    "we would like to see if hybrid inflation is safe under large scale curvature perturbations during the waterfall phase transition .",
    "if one considers only the classical evolution of the system , we show that during the phase transition the highly - blue tilted entropy perturbations can induce large blue - tilted curvature perturbations on super - horizon scales which can completely dominate over the original adiabatic curvature perturbations . however , we show that the quantum back - reactions of the waterfall field inhomogeneities produced during the phase transition become important before the classical back - reactions become relevant .",
    "we demonstrate that the cumulative quantum back - reactions of the short - wavelength inhomogeneities are so strong that they uplift the tachyonic instability of the entropy perturbations and the curvature perturbations freezes .",

    "below we justify this proposal so one can introduce an effective classical trajectory defined by @xmath183 .    to justify our proposal , we start with the conventional method for the evolution of super - horizon curvature perturbations @xcite . in the study of curvature perturbations in hybrid inflation",

    "similar to the analysis in classical case , the induced curvature perturbations becomes [ final ] ~ ( ) ^3 .",
    "as in @xcite , eq . ( [ final ] ) shows that the induced curvature perturbations from the entropy perturbations has the power spectrum @xmath210 and is suppressed compared to the primordial curvature perturbations by the factor @xmath211 . as @xmath212 and @xmath213 one concludes that @xmath214 for any reasonable values of the coupling @xmath6 .",
    "this indicates that there would be no large scale curvature perturbations once the quantum back - reactions are turned on during the phase transition .",
    "physically this means that the cumulative quantum back - reactions of very small scale modes , modes which become tachyonic during the phase transition but remained sub - horizon during entire inflation , shuts off the background @xmath4 instability , forcing @xmath3 and @xmath4 to their global minima ending inflation quickly .",
    "the tachyonic instability of entropy perturbations are lifted and they can not produce appreciable large scale curvature perturbations during the phase transition .",

    "this question was studied in @xcite .",

    "in this paper the possibility of producing large scale curvature perturbations induced from the entropy perturbations during the waterfall phase transition in hybrid inflation are studied .",
    "we have shown that whether or not appreciable amounts of large scale curvature perturbations are produced depend crucially on the competition between classical and quantum mechanical back - reactions to terminate inflation .",
    "if one considers only the classical back - reaction effects , one obtains a significant large scale curvature perturbations which completely dominate over the initial curvature perturbations .",
    "the induced large scale curvature perturbations would be highly blue - tilted with @xmath222 as in @xcite .",
    "however , we have shown that the quantum - mechanical back - reactions of the waterfall field inhomogeneities produced during the phase transition dominate before the classical - back - reaction becomes important . in the hartree approximation we found that the quantum back - reactions shuts off the classical tachyonic instability very efficiently terminating inflation as well as curvature perturbations evolutions quickly after phase transition",
    "we have shown that the main contribution to quantum back - reactions comes from the cumulation of the very small scales inhomogeneities , modes which are tachyonic during the phase transition but remain sub - horizon during entire inflationary period .",
    "we also made the interesting observation that in standard hybrid inflation where the waterfall field rapidly freezes to @xmath185 at the background level , one can use @xmath223 as the effective classical trajectory . in summary ,",

    "although we have presented the analysis here only for the standard hybrid inflation , but we believe that this picture also holds for other models of inflation where there are sharp phase transitions at the end of inflation .",
    "this includes models of brane inflation where inflation ends abruptly due to tachyon formation once the distance between the brane and anti - brane reaches a critical value .",
    "however , it would be interesting to see what happens in models of inflation , such as in double inflation @xcite where there is a mild phase transition in fields evolution during early stages of inflation . since the difference @xmath224 in eq .",
    "( [ final ] ) is not very large , an appreciable amount of curvature perturbations can be created even when the quantum mechanical back - reactions are taken into account .",

    "<S> in this paper the possibility of generating large scale curvature perturbations induced from the entropic perturbations during the waterfall phase transition of standard hybrid inflation model is studied . </S>",
    "<S> we show that whether or not appreciable amounts of large scale curvature perturbations are produced during the waterfall phase transition depend crucially on the competition between the classical and the quantum mechanical back - reactions to terminate inflation . </S>",
    "<S> if one considers only the classical evolution of the system we show that the highly blue - tilted entropy perturbations induce highly blue - tilted large scale curvature perturbations during the waterfall phase transition which dominate over the original adiabatic curvature perturbations . however , we show that the quantum back - reactions of the waterfall field inhomogeneities produced during the phase transition dominate completely over the classical back - reactions . </S>",
    "<S> the cumulative quantum back - reactions of very small scales tachyonic modes terminate inflation very efficiently and shut off the curvature perturbations evolution during the waterfall phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the standard hybrid inflation model is safe under large scale curvature perturbations during the waterfall phase transition . </S>"
