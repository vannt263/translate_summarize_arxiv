    "the development of self - consistent many - body theories aiming at the description of low - energy nuclear phenomena provides the necessary theoretical tools for an exploration of the nuclear chart into known and unknown regions .",
    "theoretical methods ( both relativistic @xcite and non - relativistic @xcite ) formulated within the framework of density functional theory ( dft ) are the most promising tools for the global investigation of the properties of atomic nuclei .",
    "the power of the dft models is essentially unchallenged in medium and heavy mass nuclei where ab - initio type few - body calculations are computationally impossible and the applicability of the spherical shell model is restricted to a few regions in the vicinity of doubly shell closures .",
    "the _ mean field _ is a basic concept of every dft .",
    "one can specify _ time - even _ and _ time - odd _ mean fields @xcite dependent on the response of these fields to the action of time - reversal operator . while the properties of time - even mean fields in nuclear density functionals are reasonably well understood and defined @xcite , there are still many unknowns in our knowledge of time - odd mean fields which appear only in the nuclear systems with broken time - reversal symmetry .",
    "this is especially true in the covariant density functional theory ( cdft ) @xcite where only few articles were dedicated to the study of time - odd mean fields ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for review ) .",
    "note that the effects , produced by the magnetic potential in the dirac equation and called as _ nuclear magnetism _",
    "( nm ) @xcite in the framework of the cdft , are due to time - odd mean fields .",
    "rotating nuclei represent a system which is strongly affected by time - odd mean fields . the representative studies of few examples @xcite clearly show that the kinematic and dynamic moments of inertia of the nuclei rotating in collective manner are considerably affected by time - odd mean fields .",
    "it was shown in the cdft framework @xcite that microscopic mechanism of this modification is traced back to the modifications of the expectation values of the single - particle angular momentum @xmath0 in the presence of nm . the contribution to @xmath0 due to nm",
    "is defined as @xmath1 where the subscripts nm and wnm indicate the values obtained in the calculations with and without nm , respectively .",
    "the @xmath2 is positive at the bottom and negative at the top of the @xmath3-shell @xcite .",
    "the absolute value of @xmath2 correlates with the absolute value of @xmath0 .",
    "note that the contributions to @xmath0 due to nm are small in the middle of the shell .",
    "the @xmath2 contributions can be decomposed into the contributions due to spin ( @xmath4 ) and orbital ( @xmath5 ) angular momenta , which have complicated dependences both on the frequency and the structure of the single - particle orbital under study @xcite .",
    "similar features are expected also in non - relativistic dft @xcite .",
    "the changes in the alignment properties of the single - particle orbitals induced by nm ( eq .  ( [ deltaj ] ) )",
    "reflect themselves also in physical observables such as effective alignments and the energy splittings between signature partner orbitals ( signature splitting ) , measured experimentally @xcite .",
    "moments of inertia and effective alignments in normal- and superdeformed nuclei in different parts of nuclear chart @xcite are well described by the parametrizations which include non - linear self - couplings only for the @xmath6-meson ( see table 1 in ref .",
    "this fact strongly suggests that nm is well accounted in this type of the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) parametrizations .",
    "in addition , nm can have an impact on the energy gap between the yrast and excited configurations in local minima ( as illustrated on the example of the hyperdeformed minima in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , on the terminating states @xcite and on the additivity of angular momentum alignments @xcite .",
    "a systematic investigation of time - odd mean fields in one- ( two- ) particle states in odd ( odd - odd ) non - rotating nuclei has been performed in our previous article @xcite .",
    "the current manuscript is a continuation of our efforts aimed on comprehensive understanding of time - odd mean fields in cdft .",

    "@xcite shows large variety of the parametrizations of the rmf lagrangian .",
    "the investigation of all these parametrizations is definitely beyond the scope of this study .",
    "thus , the present investigation has been focused on the study of time - odd mean fields in the cdft with the parametrizations of the rmf lagrangian including only non - linear self - couplings of the @xmath6-meson ( the group a of the parametrizations in table 1 of ref .",
    "so far , only this group of parametrizations has been used in the study of rotating nuclei @xcite .",
    "the results of the study of time - odd mean fields in the groups b , c , and d of the parametrizations of meson - coupling models ( table 1 in ref .",
