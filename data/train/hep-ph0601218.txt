    "flavor - changing neutral - current ( fcnc ) interactions of top quarks are among the most promising processes to deal with as a probe of new physics .",
    "this is so because that kind of processes are ( in contrast to low - energy meson fcnc physics ) extremely suppressed in the sm .",
    "for instance , while radiative @xmath6-meson decays have branching ratios of order @xmath7 , typical fcnc top - quark decays , such as @xmath8 and @xmath9 , have sm branching ratios of order of at most @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively @xcite , which in practice are impossible to measure . and among these fcnc processes the rarest ones in the sm are those involving the top quark and the higgs boson , e.g. @xmath12@xcite and the crossed one @xmath13-@xmath14 ( depending on the higgs mass)@xcite .",
    "fortunately , when one considers the impact of new physics ( e.g. supersymmetry or generalized higgs sectors ) the situation may change dramatically . indeed , as first emphasized in the detailed work of @xcite , the fcnc processes involving top quarks and higgs bosons may constitute a prominent door to susy physics in high - luminosity colliders . in that work it was found that , in contradistinction to the sm case , the top - quark decays into mssm higgs bosons @xmath15@xcite can be the most favored fcnc top decays of all , with branching ratios that can reach the level of @xmath16 .",
    "this is not possible ( without fine - tuning ) for the fcnc top quark decays into gauge bosons in the mssm , which stay typically two orders of magnitude below@xcite .",
    "similarly , the maximal mssm higgs boson fcnc rates into top - quark final states , e.g. @xmath17 , can be of order @xmath18@xcite , which suggests that these decays could be a source of a sizeable number of fcnc events @xmath0 and @xmath1 in a high - luminosity collider .",
    "actually , a detailed calculation of the number of these events at the lhc has recently been reported in@xcite and confirmed this expectation , to wit : a few thousand fcnc events per @xmath19 of integrated luminosity are possible .",
    "furthermore , a number of works have stressed the importance of this kind of fcnc processes in more general two - higgs - doublet models ( 2hdm)@xcite , including some effects that could appear in multiple higgs models@xcite .",
    "finally , let us also mention the possibility of enhanced fcnc top - quark effects in top - color assisted technicolor models@xcite .",
    "a general , model - independent , parametrization of new fcnc effects is presented in@xcite .",
    "interestingly enough , there also exists the possibility to produce @xmath0 and @xmath1 final states without higgs bosons or any other intervening particle . in this work",
    "we will show that the fcnc gluino interactions in the mssm can actually be the most efficient mechanism for direct fcnc production of top quarks .",
    "the flavor structure of the mssm involves fermion and sfermion mass matrices , and in general the diagonalization of the first flavor structure does not guarantee the diagonalization of the second .",
    "for example , the requirement of @xmath20 invariance means that the top - left - squark mass matrix can not be simultaneously diagonal to the bottom - left - squark mass matrix , and therefore these two matrices can not be in general simultaneously diagonal with the top - quark and bottom - quark mass matrices .",
    "even if we would arrange this to be so , the radiative corrections ( e.g. from the charged currents ) would destroy this arrangement .",
    "this is a sign that one can not consistently demand the absence of flavor - mixing interactions in the mssm . indeed , even if we would `` align '' the parameters at a high energy gut scale , the rg running down the electroweak scale would missalign the mass matrices@xcite . as a well - known example , let us recall that the top - squark decay into charm quark and neutralino ( @xmath21 ) is uv - divergent in the mssm , unless we allow for fcnc interaction terms in the classical lagrangian that can absorb these infinities@xcite .",
    "therefore , in general , in the mssm we expect terms of the form gluino ",
    "quark  squark or neutralino  fermion  sfermion , with the quark and squark having the same charge but belonging to different flavors . in this work",
    "we will concentrate only on the first type of terms , which are expected to be dominant .",
    "a detailed lagrangian describing these generalized susy ",
    "qcd interactions mediated by gluinos can be found , e.g. in @xcite .",
    "the relevant parameters are the flavor - mixing coefficients @xmath22 .",
    "in contrast to previous studies@xcite , we will allow them only in the ll part of the @xmath23 sfermion mass matrices in flavor - chirality space@xcite .",
    "this assumption is not only for simplicity , but also because it is suggested by rg arguments@xcite .",
    "thus , if @xmath24 is the ll block of a sfermion mass matrix , we define @xmath22 ( @xmath25 ) as follows : @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the soft susy - breaking mass parameter corresponding to the lh squark of @xmath28th flavor@xcite",
    ". we will be mostly interested in the parameter @xmath29 , because it is the one relating the second and third generations ( therefore involving the top quark physics ) .",
    "@xmath29 is the less restricted one from the phenomenological point of view .",
    "this is because the phenomenological bounds on the various @xmath22 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) are obtained from the low - energy fcnc processes .",
    "these involve mainly the first and second generations .",
    "thus @xmath29 is an essentially free parameter within , say , the natural interval @xmath30 .",
    "actually we have two such parameters , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , for the up - type and down - type ll squark mass matrices respectively .",
    "the former enters the process under study whereas the latter enters @xmath33 .",
    "we will use this observable to restrict our predictions on @xmath34 production .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     let us briefly summarize the method .",
    "define @xmath35 , which is involved in ( [ sigmatc ] ) .",
    "then the lines of constant @xmath36 are hyperbolas in the @xmath37 plane .",
    "next consider the up - type squark mass matrix in the following approximation ( in particular , only the @xmath38nd and @xmath39rd squark families are considered ) : @xmath40 upon diagonalization it is easy to see that the allowed squark masses should lie inside the circle @xmath41 whose radius is @xmath42 .",
    "notice that @xmath43 increases with @xmath44 , but we impose the ( approximate ) constraint @xmath45 to avoid color - breaking minima .",
    "this puts a bound on @xmath46 .",
    "finally , looking for the point in the straight line @xmath47 where the outermost hyperbola @xmath48 is tangent to the circle of radius @xmath43 in the @xmath49-@xmath50 plane , we find the approximate maximum at @xmath51^{1/2}}\\simeq 0.68\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : maximcomb2}\\ ] ] this is the result quoted before .",
    "the residual parameters of the maximum easily follow .",
    "a previous analysis of this process@xcite did not make a systematic study of the parameter space and did not take into account the important restrictions imposed by @xmath52 for @xmath53 ( cf .",
    "[ fig : tbat ] ) .",
    "that reference missed the bulk of the contribution and tended to emphasize that the main effects stem from the lr sector of the full mass matrix @xmath54 , namely from @xmath55 ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "in contrast , we have proved that it suffices to consider the ll sector , which is the only one that is well motivated by renormalization group arguments@xcite .",
    "finally , we note that @xmath56 final states can also be produced at one - loop by the charged - current interactions within the sm .",
    "we have computed this one - loop cross - section at the lhc , with the result @xmath57 it amounts to less than one event in the entire lifetime of the lhc .",
    "so it is pretty obvious that only the presence of new physics could be an explanation for these events , if they are ever detected .",
    "we have computed the full one - loop susy  qcd cross - section for the production of single top - quark states @xmath58 at the lhc .",
    "we have shown that this direct production mechanism is substantially more efficient ( typically a factor of @xmath59 ) than the production and subsequent fcnc decay@xcite of the heavy mssm higgs bosons ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "it is important to emphasize that , if the mass generation mechanism is associated to a fundamental higgs sector , then the detection of a significant number of @xmath58 states could be interpreted as a distinctive susy signature .",
    "the reason for this is that in an unconstrained 2hdm ( types i and ii ) , these fcnc events can not be produced at comparable rates .",
    "there is no direct production mechanism in this case ( at one - loop ) , and therefore a significant @xmath58 signature could only come from higgs - boson decays whose efficiency , though , was shown to be comparatively much smaller@xcite , namely only a few hundred events could be expected versus @xmath61 events that can be achieved by direct production in the mssm . given the robust signal carried by the single top - quark in the final state , these fcnc processes could be a very helpful tool to complement the search for susy physics at the lhc collider . before closing we point out that there are also direct susy ",
    "ew ( electroweak ) loop diagrams ( complementing the susy ",
    "qcd ones in fig.[diagrams ] ) , which could be important in certain regions of the mssm parameter space .",
    "the corresponding analysis of these susy  ew effects will be presented elsewhere .",
