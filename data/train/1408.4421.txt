    "in a recent pair of papers @xcite , we prove the existence of infinite families of bipartite ramanujan graphs of every degree and we affirmatively resolve the kadison  singer problem .",
    "the techniques that we use in the papers are closely related . in both",
    "we must show that certain families of matrices contain particular matrices of small norm . in both cases , we prove this through a new technique that we call the _ method of interlacing families of polynomials_. in the present survey , we review this technique and the polynomials that we analyze with it , the _",
    "mixed characteristic polynomials_.    we begin by defining ramanujan graphs , explaining the kadison  singer problem , and explaining how these problems are related . in particular",
    ", we connect the two by demonstrating how they are both related to the problem of sparsifying graphs .",
    "let @xmath0 be an undirected graph with vertex set @xmath1 and edge set @xmath2 .",
    "the _ adjacency matrix _ of @xmath0 is the symmetric matrix @xmath3 whose rows and columns are indexed by vertices in @xmath1 with entries @xmath4 since @xmath3 is symmetric it has @xmath5 real eigenvalues , which we will also refer to as the _ eigenvalues of _ @xmath0 .",
    "consider a function @xmath6 .",
    "multiplication by @xmath3 corresponds to the operator that replaces the value of @xmath7 at a given vertex with the sum of the values at its neighbors in @xmath0 . in this way",
    ", @xmath3 is related to random walks and diffusion on @xmath0 .",
    "it is well known that the speed of the convergence of these processes is determined by the eigenvalues of @xmath3 and related matrices .",
    "we will restrict our attention to graphs that are connected and @xmath8-regular .",
    "when @xmath5 is finite , it is easy to check that every such graph has an eigenvalue of @xmath8 corresponding to the eigenvector of all @xmath9 s . furthermore , in the case that @xmath0 is bipartite , one can check that the eigenvalues of @xmath3 are symmetric about the origin .",
    "thus every finite bipartite @xmath8-regular graph must also have an eigenvalue of @xmath10 .",
    "because these eigenvalues are unavoidable ( they are an artifact of being finite ) , they are often referred to as the _ trivial eigenvalues_. the graphs on which random walks mix the fastest are those whose non - trivial eigenvalues are as small as possible .",
    "an infinite family of connected @xmath8-regular graphs all of whose non - trivial eigenvalues are at most @xmath11 for some constant @xmath12 is called a family of _ expander graphs_. constructing @xmath8-regular expanders with a small number of vertices ( relative to @xmath8 ) is easy : for example , the complete graph on @xmath13 vertices has all non - trivial eigenvalues @xmath14 and the complete bipartite graph with @xmath15 vertices has all non - trivial eigenvalues @xmath16 . the interesting problem is to construct @xmath8-regular expanders with an arbitrarily large number of vertices .",
    "margulis @xcite was the first to find an explicit construction of such an infinite family .",
    "expander graphs have proved to be incredibly useful in a variety of contexts .",
    "we refer the reader who is interested in learning more about expander graphs , with a focus on their applications in computer science , to the survey of hoory , linial , and wigderson  @xcite .",
    "many applications of expanders depend upon the magnitudes of their non - trivial eigenvalues .",
    "a theorem of alon and boppana provides a bound on how small the non - trivial eigenvalues can be .",
    "[ thm : alonboppana ] for every integer @xmath17 and every @xmath18 , there exists an @xmath19 so that every @xmath8-regular graph @xmath0 with more than @xmath19 vertices has a non - trivial eigenvalue that is greater than @xmath20 .",
    "the number @xmath21 in theorem  [ thm : alonboppana ] has a meaning : it is the spectral radius of the infinite @xmath22regular tree , whose spectrum is the closed interval @xmath23 $ ] ( it has no trivial eigenvalues because it is not finite ) @xcite .",
    "since theorem  [ thm : alonboppana ] says that no infinite family of @xmath8-regular graphs can have eigenvalues that are asymptotically smaller than @xmath21 , we may view this infinite tree as being the `` ideal '' expander .",
    "a natural question is whether there exist infinite families of finite @xmath8-regular graphs whose eigenvalues are actually as small as those of the tree .",
    "lubotzky , phillips and sarnak  @xcite and margulis  @xcite were the first to construct infinite families of such graphs .",
    "their constructions were cayley graphs , and they exploited the algebraic properties of the underlying groups to prove that all of the nontrivial eigenvalues of their graphs have absolute value at most @xmath21 .",
    "their proofs required the proof of the ramanujan conjecture , and so they named the graphs they obtained _",
    "ramanujan graphs_. as of 2013 , all known infinite families of ramanujan graphs were obtained via constructions similar to @xcite . as a result ,",
    "all known families of ramanujan graphs had degree @xmath24 for @xmath25 a prime and @xmath26 a positive integer .",
    "the main theorem of @xcite is that there exist infinite families of @xmath8-regular bipartite ramanujan graphs for every integer @xmath17 .",
    "this is achieved by proving a variant of a conjecture of bilu and linial  @xcite , which implies that every @xmath22regular ramanujan graph has a @xmath27cover which is also ramanujan , immediately establishing the existence of an infinite sequence .",
    "in contrast to previous results , the proof is completely elementary , and we will sketch most of it in this survey .",
    "bilu and linial s conjecture is a purely linear algebraic statement about _ signings _ of adjacency matrices . to define a signing ,",
    "recall that we can write the adjacency matrix of any graph @xmath28 as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the adjacency matrix of a single edge @xmath31 .",
    "then , a signing is any matrix of the form @xmath32 where @xmath33 are signs .",
    "a graph with @xmath34 edges has exactly @xmath35 signings .",
    "bilu and linial conjectured that every @xmath22regular adjacency matrix @xmath3 has a signing @xmath36 with @xmath37 .",
    "we prove the following weaker statement , which is equivalent to their conjecture in the bipartite case , as in this case the eigenvalues are symmetric about zero .",
    "[ thm : if1 ] every @xmath22regular adjacency matrix @xmath3 has a signing @xmath36 with @xmath38    this is a statement about the existence of a certain sum of rank two matrices of type @xmath39 , but it it useful to rewrite it as a statement about a sum of rank one matrices by making the substitution @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the standard basis vector with a @xmath9 in position @xmath42 . for a @xmath22regular graph ,",
    "we now have @xmath43 so , theorem  [ thm : if1 ] is equivalent to the statement that there is a choice of @xmath44 for which @xmath45 the existence of such a choice can be written in probabilistic terms by defining for each @xmath46 a random vector @xmath47 notice that @xmath48 thus , theorem [ thm : if1 ] is equivalent to the statement that for every @xmath22regular @xmath28 , @xmath49 with positive probability .",
    "such a sum may be analyzed using tools of random matrix theory , but this approach does not give the sharp bound we require , and it is known that it can not in general as there are graphs for which the desired signing is exponentially rare ( consider a union of disjoint cliques on @xmath8 vertices ) . the main subject of this survey is an approach that succeeds in proving exactly .",
    "the methodology also succeeds in resolving several other important questions about sums of independent random rank one matrices , including weaver s conjecture and thereby the kadison  singer problem .",
    "we review these first and describe their connection to ramanujan graphs before proceeding to describe the actual technique .",
    "the proof of and theorem [ thm : if1 ] will be sketched in section [ sec : matchingpoly ] .",
    "spielman and teng  @xcite observed that one can view an expander graph as an approximation of a complete graph , and asked if one could find analogous approximations of arbitrary graphs . in this context , it is more natural to consider the class of general weighted graphs rather than just unweighted @xmath22regular graphs , and to study the _ laplacian matrix _ instead of the adjacency matrix .",
    "recall that the laplacian of a weighted graph @xmath50 may be defined as the following sum of rank one matrices over the edges : @xmath51 in the unweighted @xmath22regular case , it is easy to see that @xmath52 , so the eigenvalues of the laplacian are just @xmath8 minus the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix .",
    "the laplacian matrix of a graph always has an eigenvalue of @xmath16 ; this is a trivial eigenvalue , and the corresponding eigenvectors are the constant vectors .",
    "following spielman and teng , we say that two graphs @xmath0 and @xmath53 on the same vertex set @xmath1 are _ spectral approximations _ of each other",
    "if their laplacian quadratic forms multiplicatively approximate each other : @xmath54 for some approximation factors @xmath55 .",
    "we will write this as @xmath56 where @xmath57 means that @xmath58 is positive semidefinite , i.e. , @xmath59 for every @xmath60 .",
    "the complete graph on @xmath61 vertices , @xmath62 , is the graph with an edge of weight @xmath9 between every pair of vertices .",
    "all of the eigenvalues of @xmath63 other than @xmath16 are equal to @xmath61 . if @xmath0 is a @xmath8-regular non - bipartite ramanujan graph , then @xmath16 is the trivial eigenvalue of its laplacian matrix , @xmath64 , and all of the other eigenvalues of @xmath64 are between @xmath65 and @xmath66 . after a simple rescaling ,",
    "this allows us to conclude that @xmath67 so , @xmath68 is a good approximation of @xmath63 .",
    "batson , spielman and srivastava proved that every weighted graph has an approximation that is almost this good .",
    "[ thm : bssgraphs ] for every @xmath69 and every weighted graph @xmath50 on @xmath61 vertices , there exists a weighted graph @xmath70 with @xmath71 edges that satisfies : @xmath72    however , their proof had very little to do with graphs .",
    "in fact , they derived their result from the following theorem about sparse weighted approximations of sums of rank one matrices .",
    "[ thm : bssmatrices ] let @xmath73 be vectors in @xmath74 with @xmath75 for every @xmath76 , there exist non - negative real numbers @xmath77 with @xmath78 so that @xmath79    taking @xmath1 to be a laplacian matrix written as a sum of outer products and setting @xmath80 immediately yields theorem [ thm : bssgraphs ] .",
    "theorem [ thm : bssmatrices ] is very general and turned out to be useful in a variety of areas including graph theory , numerical linear algebra , and metric geometry ( see , for instance , the survey of naor @xcite ) .",
    "one of its limitations is that it provides no guarantees on the weights @xmath81 that it produces , which can vary wildly .",
    "so it is natural to ask : is there a version of theorem [ thm : bssmatrices ] in which all the weights are the same ?",
    "this may seem like a minor technical point , but it is actually a fundamental difference . in particular , gil kalai observed that the statement of theorem  [ thm : bssmatrices ] with @xmath82 is similar to weaver s conjecture , which was known to imply a positive solution to the kadison ",
    "singer problem .",
    "it turns out that the natural unweighted variant of it is essentially _ the same _ as weaver s conjecture .",
    "we discuss the kadison  singer problem and this connection in the next section .      in 1959 ,",
    "kadison and singer @xcite asked the following fundamental question : does every pure state on the abelian von neumann algebra @xmath83 of diagonal operators on @xmath84 have a unique extension to a pure state on @xmath85 , the von neumann algebra of all bounded operators on @xmath84 ?",
    "in their original paper , they suggested an approach to resolving this question : they showed that the answer is yes if every operator in @xmath85 can be ` paved ' by a constant number of operators which are strictly smaller in the operator norm .",
    "beginning with the work of anderson  @xcite , this was shown to be equivalent to several combinatorial questions about decomposing _",
    "finite _ matrices into a small number of strictly smaller pieces .    among these questions",
    "is akemann and anderson s `` projection paving conjecture ''  @xcite , which nik weaver @xcite later showed was equivalent to the following discrepancy - theoretic conjecture that he called @xmath86 .",
    "[ conj : weaver ] there exist positive constants @xmath11 and @xmath87 so that for every @xmath61 and @xmath8 and every set of vectors @xmath88 such that @xmath89 for all @xmath90 and @xmath91 there exists a partition of @xmath92 into two sets @xmath93 and @xmath94 so that for each @xmath95 @xmath96    to see the similarity between this conjecture and theorem [ thm : bssmatrices ] , observe that for any partition @xmath97 : @xmath98 so that condition is equivalent to @xmath99 thus , choosing a subset of the weights @xmath81 to be non - zero in theorem [ thm : bssmatrices ] is similar to choosing the set @xmath93 .",
    "the difference is that conjecture  [ conj : weaver ] assumes a bound on the lengths of the vectors @xmath100 and in return requires the stronger conclusion that all of the @xmath81 are either @xmath16 or @xmath9 .",
    "it is easy to see that long vectors are an obstacle to the existence of a good partition ; an extreme example is provided by considering an orthonormal basis @xmath101 .",
    "weaver s conjecture asserts that this is the only obstacle .",
    "overcoming this seemingly small difference turns out to require substantial new machinery beyond the techniques used in the proof of theorem  [ thm : bssmatrices ] .",
    "however , much of this machinery is built on two key ideas which are contained in @xcite .",
    "the first is the use of `` barrier functions '' to bound the roots of polynomials , which is discussed in section [ sec : unibarrier ] .",
    "the second , which was presented purely for motivational purposes in @xcite , is the examination of expected characteristic polynomials .    as in the case of ramanujan graphs ,",
    "weaver s conjecture can be written in terms of sums of independent random rank one matrices .",
    "given vectors @xmath102 , define for each @xmath90 the random vector @xmath103 @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the zero vector .",
    "then it is easy to see that every realization of @xmath106 corresponds to a partition @xmath107 $ ] in the natural way , and that @xmath108 moreover , the norm of this matrix is the maximum of the norms of the matrices in the upper - left and lower - right blocks .",
    "thus , weaver s conjecture is equivalent to the statement that when the @xmath109 , the following holds with positive probability : @xmath110    once again , it is possible to apply tools of random matrix theory to analyze this sum .",
    "this gives a proof of the conjecture with @xmath111 , essentially recovering a result of bourgain and tzafriri @xcite , which was essentially the best partial solution to kadison ",
    "singer until recently .",
    "the main result of @xcite is the following strong form of weaver s conjecture .",
    "[ thm : mss2main ] let @xmath112 satisfy @xmath113 and @xmath114 for all @xmath90 .",
    "then , there exists a partition of @xmath115 into sets @xmath93 and @xmath94 so that for @xmath95 , @xmath116    we will sketch the proof of theorem [ thm : mss2main ] , which is closely related to the proof of theorem [ thm : if1 ] , in sections [ sec : mixed ] and [ sec : multibarrier ] .",
    "as witnessed by equations and , the common thread in the problems described above is that they can all be resolved by showing that a certain sum of independent random rank one matrices has small eigenvalues with nonzero probability .",
    "prior to this line of work , there were already well - developed tools in random matrix theory for reasoning about such sums , generally called matrix chernoff bounds  @xcite .",
    "as mentioned earlier , these provide bounds that are worse than those we require by a factor that is logarithmic in the dimension . however , they hold with high probability rather than the merely positive probability that we obtain .",
    "our approach to analyzing the eigenvalues of sums of independent rank one random matrices rests on the following connection between possible values of any particular eigenvalue , and the corresponding root of its expected characteristic polynomial .",
    "we will use @xmath117 to denote the eigenvalues of a hermitian matrix as well as the roots of a real - rooted polynomial .",
    "[ thm : comparison ] suppose @xmath118 are independent random vectors . then , for every @xmath26 , @xmath119 \\left(x \\right)}\\right),\\ ] ] with positive probability , and the same is true with @xmath120 instead of @xmath121 .    in the special case when the @xmath122 are identically distributed with @xmath123 ,",
    "there is short proof of theorem [ thm : comparison ] that only requires univariate interlacing .",
    "we present this proof as lemma [ lem : induct ] and and use it to establish a variant of bourgain and tzafriri s restricted invertibility theorem . in section [ sec : mixed ] we prove the theorem in full generality using tools from the theory of real stable polynomials .",
    "this yields mixed characteristic polynomials , which are then analyzed in sections [ sec : matchingpoly ] and [ sec : multibarrier ] to prove the existence of infinite families of bipartite ramanujan graphs as well as weaver s conjecture",
    "a defining characteristic of the proofs in @xcite and @xcite is that they analyze matrices solely through their characteristic polynomials .",
    "this is perhaps a counterintuitive way to proceed ; on the surface , we are losing information by considering characteristic polynomials , which only know about eigenvalues and not eigenvectors .",
    "however , the structure we gain far outweighs the losses in two ways : the characteristic polynomials satisfy a number of algebraic identities which make calculating their averages tractable , and they are amenable to a set of analytic tools that do not naturally apply to matrices .    as hinted at earlier , we study the roots of _ averages _ of polynomials . in general ,",
    "averaging polynomials coefficient - wise can do unpredictable things to the roots . for instance , the average of @xmath124 and @xmath125 , which are both real - rooted quadratics , is @xmath126 , which has complex roots @xmath127 .",
    "even when the roots of the average are real , there is in general no simple relationship between the roots of two polynomials and the roots of their average .",
    "the main insight is that there are nonetheless many situations where averaging the coefficients of polynomials also has the effect of averaging each of the roots individually , and that it is possible to identify and exploit these situations .",
    "the key to doing this systematically is the classical notion of _",
    "let @xmath7 be a degree @xmath61 polynomial with real roots @xmath128 , and let @xmath129 be degree @xmath61 or @xmath130 with real roots @xmath131 ( ignoring @xmath132 in the degree @xmath130 case ) .",
    "we say that @xmath129 interlaces @xmath7 if their roots alternate , i.e. , @xmath133 and the largest root belongs to @xmath7 .",
    "if there is a single @xmath129 which interlaces a family of polynomials @xmath134 , we say that they have a _",
    "common interlacing_.    it is an easy exercise to show that @xmath134 of degree @xmath61 have a common interlacing iff there are closed intervals @xmath135 ( where @xmath121 means to the left of ) such that the @xmath90th roots of all the @xmath136 are contained in @xmath137 .",
    "it is also easy to see that a set of polynomials has a common interlacing iff every pair of them has a common interlacing ( this may be viewed as helly s theorem on the real line ) .",
    "we now state our main theorem about averages of polynomials with common interlacings .",
    "[ thm : interlace ] suppose @xmath134 are real - rooted of degree @xmath61 with positive leading coefficients .",
    "let @xmath138 denote the @xmath139 largest root of @xmath136 and let @xmath140 be any distribution on @xmath141 $ ] .",
    "if @xmath134 have a common interlacing , then for all @xmath142 @xmath143    the proof of this theorem is a three line exercise , which essentially amounts to applying the intermediate value theorem inside each interval @xmath137 .",
    "an important feature of common interlacings is that their existence is _ equivalent _ to certain real - rootedness statements .",
    "often , this characterization gives us a systematic way to argue that common interlacings exist .",
    "the following seems to have been discovered a number of times .",
    "it appears as theorem  @xmath144 of dedieu  @xcite , ( essentially ) as theorem  @xmath145 of fell  @xcite , and as ( a special case of ) theorem 3.6 of chudnovsky and seymour  @xcite .",
    "the proof of it included below assumes that the roots of a polynomial are continuous functions of its coefficients ( which may be shown using elementary complex analysis ) .",
    "[ thm : fell ] if @xmath134 are degree @xmath61 polynomials and all of their convex combinations @xmath146 have real roots , then they have a common interlacing .",
    "since common interlacing is a pairwise condition , it suffices to handle the case of two polynomials @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "let @xmath149 with @xmath150 $ ] .",
    "assume without loss of generality that @xmath147 and @xmath148 have no common roots ( if they do , divide them out and put them back in at the end ) .",
    "as @xmath151 varies from @xmath16 to @xmath9 , the roots of @xmath152 define @xmath61 continuous curves in the complex plane @xmath153 , each beginning at a root of @xmath147 and ending at a root of @xmath148 . by our assumption",
    "the curves must all lie in the real line .",
    "observe that no curve can cross a root of either @xmath147 or @xmath148 in the middle : if @xmath154 for some @xmath155 and @xmath156 , then immediately we also have @xmath157 , contradicting the no common roots assumption .",
    "thus , each curve defines a closed interval containing exactly one root of @xmath147 and one root of @xmath148 , and these intervals do not overlap except possibly at their endpoints , establishing the existence of a common interlacing .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the converse of theorem  [ thm : fell ] is true as well , but we will not use this fact .    while interlacing and real - rootedness are",
    "entirely univariate notions as discussed above , the most powerful ways to apply them arise by viewing them as restrictions of multivariate phenomena .",
    "there are two important generalizations of real - rootedness to more than one variable : real stability and hyperbolicity .",
    "we were inspired by the development of the theory of real stability in the works of borcea and , including @xcite .",
    "their results center primarily around characterizations of stable polynomials , including closure properties ( that is , operations that preserve real stability of polynomials ) and showing that properties of various mathematical structures an be related to the stability of some `` generating polynomial '' of that structure .",
    "there is an isomorphism between real stable polynomials and _ hyperbolic polynomials _ , a concept that originated in a series of papers by grding @xcite in his investigation of partial differential equations .",
    "the theory of hyperbolic polynomials was developed further in the optimization community ( see the survey of renegar @xcite ) .",
    "however , it was not until gurvits s use of hyperbolic polynomials in his proof of the van der waerden conjecture @xcite , that their combinatorial power was revealed .    while it is well known that the concepts of real stability and hyperbolicity are essentially equivalent ( one can translate easily between the two ) , various features of the way each property is defined have led to a natural separation of results : algebraic closure properties and characterization in real stability and analytic properties such as convexity in hyperbolicity .",
    "the  method of interlacing polynomials \" discussed in this survey , is in many ways a recipe for mixing the ideas from these two communities into a single proof technique .",
    "the method of interlacing polynomials consists of two somewhat distinct parts .",
    "the first is to show that a given collection of polynomials forms what we call an _ interlacing family _",
    ", which is broadly speaking any class of polynomials for which the roots of its average can be related to those of the individual polynomials .",
    "this falls naturally into the realm of results regarding real stable polynomials as it often reduces to that showing various linear combinations of polynomials are real - rooted .",
    "the second part is to bound one of the roots of the expected polynomial under some distribution .",
    "this is more of an analytic task , for which the convexity properties studied in the context of hyperbolicity are relevant .",
    "for instance , in @xcite , the analysis of the largest root is based on understanding the evolution of the root surfaces defined by a multivariate polynomial as certain differential operators are applied to it , and draws on the same convexity properties that are at the core of hyperbolic polynomials .",
    "the purpose of this section is to give the simplest possible demonstration of the method of interlacing families of polynomials",
    ". it will be completely elementary and self - contained , relying only on classical facts about univariate polynomials , and should be accessible to an undergraduate . nonetheless , it is structurally almost identical to the proof of weaver s conjecture and contains most of the same conceptual components in a primitive form .",
    "bourgain and tzafriri s restricted invertibility theorem @xcite states that any square matrix @xmath158 with unit length columns and small operator norm contains a large column submatrix @xmath159 which is well - invertible on its span .",
    "that is , the least singular value of the submatrix , @xmath160 , is large .",
    "this may be seen as a robust , quantitative version of the fact that any matrix contains an invertible submatrix of size equal to its rank .",
    "the theorem was generalized to arbitrary rectangular @xmath158 by vershynin @xcite , and further sharpened in @xcite .",

    ", we will inductively apply theorem [ thm : interlace ] , which requires the existence of certain common interlacings .",

    "tzafriri , this entire chain of reasoning can be carried out by considering univariate polynomials only .",

    "the most important consequence of theorem [ thm : mixed ] is that mixed characteristic polynomials always have real roots . to prove this",

    "a natural and relevant example of real stable polynomials is the following :    [ lem : det ] if @xmath284 are positive semidefinite matrices , then @xmath285 is real stable .",
    "one reason real stability is such a useful notion for us is that it has remarkable closure properties which are extremely well - understood in particular , borcea and  have completely characterized the linear operators preserving real stability  @xcite .",
    "what this means heuristically is that proofs of stability can often be reduced to a formal exercise : to prove that a particular polynomial is stable , one must simply write it as a composition of known stability - preserving operations .    to prove that mixed characteristic polynomials are real stable , we will only require the following elementary closure properties .    if @xmath286 is real stable , then so are @xmath287 and @xmath288    the first part was essentially established by lieb and sokal in @xcite .",

    "the above proof highlights the added flexibility of allowing the @xmath122 to have different distributions : by taking some of these distributions to be deterministic , we can encode any conditioning and more generally any addition of a positive semidefinite matrix while remaining in the class of mixed characteristic polynomials .",
    "in this section , we describe two situations in which we are able to bound the largest roots of mixed characteristic polynomials .",
    "the first is very specific : we observe that the expected characteristic polynomial of a random signing of an adjacency matrix of a graph is equal , up to a shift , to the matching polynomial of the graph .",
    "the zeros of this polynomial have been studied for decades and elementary combinatorial arguments due to heilmann and lieb @xcite can be used to give a sharp bound on its largest root .",
    "the main consequence of this bound is the existence of infinite families of bipartite ramanujan graphs of every degree .",

    "we now observe that this expected characteristic polynomial is equal to the _ matching polynomial _ of the graph .",
    "a matching is a graph in which every vertex has degree at most one .",
    "the matching polynomial is a generating function which counts the number of matchings that are subgraphs of a graph ; for a graph on @xmath61 vertices , it is defined as @xmath308 where @xmath309 is the number of subgraphs of @xmath0 with @xmath90 edges that are matchings .",

    "about a decade before this , heilmann and lieb @xcite studied the matching polynomial in the context of monomer - dimer systems in statistical physics . in that paper , they showed that @xmath312 always has all real roots ( a fact which we have also just proved by writing it as a shift of a mixed characteristic polynomial ) , and that @xmath313 for a graph with maximum degree @xmath8 .",
    "they proved this bound by finding certain simple combinatorial recurrences satisfied by @xmath312 , induced by edge and vertex deletions .",
    "the appearance of the number @xmath21 is not a coincidence ; godsil @xcite later showed using similar recurrences that @xmath312 divides the characteristic polynomial of a certain tree associated with @xmath0 , which is an induced subgraph of the infinite @xmath22regular tree .",

    "there is also a generalization of this theorem which proves the existence of `` irregular '' ramanujan graphs , which were not previously known to exist ; we refer the interested reader to @xcite for details .",
    "the tight bound of @xmath21 obtained above relies heavily on the fact that the random vectors @xmath314 of interest come from a graph and have combinatorial structure .",
    "remarkably , it turns out that we can prove a bound that is almost as sharp by completely ignoring this structure and relying only on the much weaker property that the @xmath315 are rank one matrices of bounded trace .",
    "this type of generic bound is precisely what one needs to control the roots of the quite general mixed characteristic polynomials which arise in the proof of weaver s conjecture , and thereby prove kadison  singer .",

    "the difference is that the differential operators and roots are now multivariate rather than univariate .    to deal with this issue",

    "we conclude by showing how the generic bound derived above may be used to analyze the random signings that occur in the proof of theorem [ thm : if1 ] .",
    "this turns out to be very instructive and is quite natural , since when @xmath28 is @xmath22regular , tells us that @xmath335 thus , each vector has the same norm @xmath336 , and applying theorems [ thm : comparison ] and [ thm : mixedbound ] shows that @xmath337 with positive probability .",
