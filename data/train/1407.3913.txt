    "space astrometry missions such as gaia and jasmine are expected to reach a few micro arcseconds @xcite . moreover , high - accuracy vlbi is also available .",
    "orbit determinations for binaries have been considered for a long time . for visual binaries , formulations for orbit determinations",
    "have been well developed since the nineteenth century @xcite . at present , numerical methods",
    "are successfully used @xcite .",
    "furthermore , an analytic solution for an astrometric binary , where one object is unseen , has been found @xcite .",
    "the solution requires that sufficiently accurate positions of a star ( or a photocenter of the binary ) are measured at more than four places during an orbital cycle of the binary system .",
    "a moment approach for a low signal - to - noise ( sn ) ratio is proposed by iwama et al .",
    "( 2013 , hereafter the _",
    "iwama+ approach _ ) .",
    "for a close binary system with a short orbital period , we have a relatively large uncertainty in the position measurements .",
    "for instance , the orbital periods of cyg x-1 and ls 5039 are nearly 6 days and 4 days , respectively , which are extremely shorter than that of normal binary stars , say a few months and several years .",
    "although temporal information is not incorporated in the iwama+ approach , this approach would be useful to obtain recovered values of orbital parameters , when observational errors are much smaller than a binary apparent size .",
    "it would be convenient to use the recovered values as trial values of the steepest descent method for reaching the best - fit parameter values .",
    "on the other hand , if observational errors are comparable to or larger than a binary apparent size , the orbital parameters can not be recovered well , because the expected values of the statistical moments are quite different from the true values .",
    "hence , it is important to improve the iwama+ approach in order to treat such a case of extremely low sn ratio .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to improve the previous approach by using temporal information of observed points .",
    "however , the use of the kepler equation is still avoided like the previous approach .",
    "we consider a kepler orbit , whose semi - major axis , eccentricity , inclination angle , argument of periastron , and longitude of ascending node are @xmath1 ( see fig .",
    "[ config ] ) . here , we focus on a binary whose orbital period @xmath2 is known by other observations .",
    "angular positions projected onto the celestial sphere are expressed by using the thiele - innes elements @xcite .",
    "let us assume frequent observations of the angular position in the celestial sphere .",
    "namely , we consider a large number of observed points .",
    "for such a case , the statistical average expressed as a summation is taken as the temporal average in an integral form as @xmath3 where @xmath4 denotes the mean and @xmath5 denotes the total time duration of the observations .    in this paper , we focus on the periodic motion , so that the above expression becomes the integration over several orbital periods .",
    "we thus obtain @xmath6 where @xmath7 is an integer and we used the kepler equation @xmath8 and @xmath9 . here , @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote the eccentric anomaly and the time of periastron passage , respectively .",
    "let us consider statistical moments .",
    "the second and the third moments of the projected position in @xmath12 coordinates are useful to determine orbital parameters . they are defined as @xmath13 where observational errors are assumed to vanish at the last equal in each equation , and @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 are the thiele - innes type elements defined by @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the semi - minor axis .",
    "the moments @xmath20 are actually observables . for the moments calculation ,",
    "temporal information of each observed position is smeared by averaging .",
    "if positions of a star are measured with sufficiently small observation errors , one can recover the orbital parameters well by the iwama+ approach @xcite .",
    "in the above formalism , we assume that observed points are located on an apparent ellipse . however , position measurements are inevitably associated with observational errors .",
    "therefore , it is very important to take into account observation noises . in this paper",
    ", we add gaussian errors into position measurements as @xmath21 and @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 obey gaussian distributions with a standard deviation @xmath25 .",
    "then , the expected values of the moments are estimated as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the total number of observed points , and the upper indices @xmath28 and @xmath29 denote observables including observational errors and true values corresponding to eqs .",
    "( [ mxx ] ) - ( [ mxyy ] ) , respectively . since @xmath27 is a large number , @xmath30 .",
    "( [ error - xx ] ) and ( [ error - yy ] ) suggest that orbital parameters are not recovered well in the case that @xmath31 is comparable to or larger than @xmath32 and @xmath33 , even if @xmath27 approaches the infinity . in this section , we improve the iwama+ approach to obtain the moments with a higher accuracy for such a large observational errors by incorporating temporal information .      by incorporating temporal information , we average the coordinate values of observed points which are neighboring positions .",
    "let us assume that an orbital period of a binary @xmath2 is known with high accuracy by another observation , such as observations of absorption lines ( e.g. , @xcite for cyg x-1 and @xcite for ls 5039 ) .",
    "if observational errors are so large , neighboring positions on the orbit can be considered as the same position within some errors . in other words",
    ", one can identify an observed point at a time @xmath34 with another one at a time @xmath35 when @xmath36 in the units of @xmath37 , where @xmath38    let us divide the apparent ellipse into small bins , each of which corresponds to an equal short time interval , e.g. , @xmath39 $ ] , where @xmath40 is the number of the bins . if the same star is observed at fixed intervals , then",
    ", every bin has the equal number of observed points @xmath41 and one obtains more bins near the apastron than near periastron .",
    "namely , every bin will contain the same number of points if and only if the interval between the observations is not a multiple of the bin duration .",
    "note that we can use the data over several orbital periods , so that each bin may include observed points of different orbital periods .    in order to reduce statistical errors , we average the positions of @xmath42 observed points for each bin and obtain @xmath40 averaged points ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - ave ] ) . with this averaging operation ,",
    "the expected values of the moments are given as @xmath43 where the bar denotes the value obtained by @xmath40 averaged points .",
    "hence , if @xmath42 is sufficiently large , the errors of @xmath44 and @xmath45 could be neglected safely .",
    "therefore , the iwama+ approach is improved with regard to the accuracy of the moments by the averaging operation .",
    "in eqs . ( [ average1 ] ) and ( [ average2 ] ) , we assume that one can integrate observed quantities . in practice , however , observations are discrete , for which the integration should be replaced by a summation . the integration and",
    "the summation could agree in the limit that @xmath40 approaches the infinity .",
    "in addition , it is necessary that @xmath42 is so large to reduce errors . according to the numerical calculations ,",
    "the present approach recovers orbital parameters for @xmath46 ( see the discussion in @xcite in the absence of the averaging operation , i.e. @xmath47 & @xmath48 ) . therefore , one can use @xmath49 points for the averaging operation on each bin .    for the true parameters @xmath50 } , 30 \\mathrm{~[deg . ] } , 30 \\mathrm{~[deg.]})$ ] , we consider two cases for @xmath51 .",
    "case 1 : the observational error for each position measurement is equal to a binary size , namely , @xmath52 in the units of @xmath53 .",
    "case 2 : @xmath54 in the units of @xmath53 . for each case , @xmath55 is fixed where we imagine an instrument , such as the small - jasmine . for each parameter set , 100 realizations are done and the mean and the standard deviation are also evaluated .    fig .",
    "[ comparing ] shows the apparent orbits for the mean values of the recovered parameters by iwama+ approach and the present one . the present approach can recover the orbital parameters better than the iwama+ approach",
    "especially , one can see that the true orbit and the recovered orbit by the present approach almost overlap each other for @xmath52 .",
    "table [ table - compare ] is a list of orbital parameters that are recovered by the iwama+ approach and the present approach for @xmath56 , respectively . in both cases ,",
    "the difference between the true value of the semi - major axis and the mean of the recovered one decreases to less than a tenth .",
    "this can be seen in fig . [ comparing ] , and is consistent with an order - of - magnitude estimation from eqs .",
    "( [ average - xx ] ) and ( [ average - yy ] ) ( see appendix [ order - estimate ] ) . on the other hand , the dispersion of recovered parameters is not improved by the averaging operation since the order of magnitude of the dispersion depends on not @xmath42 but @xmath55 .    in the case 1 , the longitude of ascending node is well recovered with the accuracy of less than 10 % of the true value , while the other recovered parameters by the iwama+ approach are quite different from the true values . by the averaging operation ,",
    "all of mean recovered values approach the true values . in the case 2 , the recovered values except @xmath57 are improved .",
    "our numerical tests suggest that @xmath57 and @xmath58 are not always improved by the present approach .",
    "however , this point is not important , since the change of the differences between the recovered values of @xmath57 and @xmath58 and the true values of them are smaller than the dispersion of the recovered values .    in order to confirm the reliability of the above results , we calculate for @xmath59 parameter sets as @xmath60 and @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 [ deg .",
    "] , @xmath64 and @xmath63 [ deg . ] , and @xmath65 and @xmath63 [ deg . ] .",
    "one example as @xmath66 } , 60 \\mathrm{~[deg . ] } , 60 \\mathrm{~[deg.]})$ ] is added into table [ table - compare ] for saving the space .",
    "fourier analyses recover the orbital period from numerically simulated data of the above two cases with the accuracy of @xmath67 1 % and 5 % , respectively .      let us consider a possible application to cyg x-1 , whose angular radius is @xmath68 milli - arcseconds ( mas ) .",
    "the required precision of the small - jasmine is @xmath69 mas , so that @xmath70 . for cyg x-1 , the small - jasmine is expected to measure the position of the star with the accuracy of 3 mas , which corresponds to @xmath71 , for each imaging .",
    "hence , the position measurements of @xmath72 times are required as one data - set for @xmath73 .    since the small - jasmine is expected to measure for @xmath74 orbital periods of cyg x-1 , @xmath75 observed points , which correspond to 10 data - sets , will be obtained .",
    "this means that @xmath76 exceeds the required precision of the small - jasmine .",
    "however , every observed point has the systematic error of the small - jasmine as @xmath77 mas , so that the recovered parameters might also have the error of @xmath77 mas .    in this paper",
    ", we consider two cases as numerical tests where we fix @xmath55 for each data - set .",
    "case 1 : @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 . in this case",
    ", the present approach reduces to the iwama+ one .",
    "case 2 : @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 . see table [ table - cygx-1 ] for a comparison of these cases of one data - set . in the case 2",
    ", the present approach recovers the semi - major axis and the inclination better than the iwama+ one .    on the other hand ,",
    "the recovered eccentricity by the iwama+ approach is close to the true value , which is considered to be an accidental coincidence .",
    "numerical calculations of other parameter sets suggest that the recovered eccentricities by the iwama+ approach and the present one are close to @xmath84 and @xmath85 , respectively , for any true eccentricity in the case 2 .",
    "hence , the recovered eccentricities by the two approaches may not be reliable when @xmath86 .",
    "for the reliability of the recovered eccentricity , the position measurement with the accuracy of @xmath87 , which corresponds to the case 1 in the table [ table - compare ] , is required .",
    "the recovered values by the present approach are comparable to those by the iwama+ approach for the argument of periastron and the longitude of ascending node .",
    "the recovered parameters by the present approach in the case 2 are comparable to the case 1 .",
    "these numerical results suggest that one can obtain the similar results for @xmath79 and @xmath82 by the averaging operation .",
    "hence , the present approach works well to reduce @xmath25 effectively for @xmath88 .",
    "next , let us consider the same two cases for 10 data - sets .",
    "table [ table - cygx-1 - 10sets ] shows the recovered values by the iwama+ approach and the present approach for 10 data - sets . in both cases ,",
    "each bin has 10 data - sets of @xmath42 observed points , so that @xmath89 observed points are effectively averaged in the present approach . on the other hand ,",
    "every observed point is not averaged in the previous approach .    for the semi - major axis , the mean values of the recovered parameters by the previous approach of 10 data - sets in both cases are comparable to those of one data - set . on the other hand ,",
    "the recovered semi - major axis by the present approach of 10 data - sets in both cases are much better than those of one data - set",
    ".    however , the recovered eccentricities by the both approaches may not be reliable if @xmath86 by the similar reason of one data - set .",
    "for the reliability of the recovered eccentricity , the position measurement with the accuracy of @xmath87 , which corresponds to the case 1 in the table [ table - compare ] , is required . for the inclination ,",
    "the mean values of the recovered parameters by the present approach are better than those by the previous approach .",
    "the recovered values by the present approach are comparable to those by the previous approach for the argument of periastron and the longitude of ascending node .",
    "note that the dispersion of the recovered semi - major axis for 10 data - sets corresponds to random errors of observations .",
    "therefore , the actual observational errors including the systematic errors of the small - jasmine will be comparable to the dispersion of table [ table - cygx-1 ] .",
    "these results suggest that the semi - major axis of cyg x-1 is recovered with the accuracy comparable to or smaller than the true value of the semi - major axis by the small - jasmine observations . in order to search the best - fit parameter values , recovered values by the present moment approach would work well as trial values in the steepest descent method .      as stated in section 1 ,",
    "asada , akasaka , and kasai ( 2004 ) have found an exact solution for orbit determinations of astrometric binaries .",
    "the least square method is incorporated into the analytic solution by asada , akasaka , and kudoh ( 2007 ) .",
    "their numerical calculations show that the analytic method recovers orbital elements for small @xmath25 cases , such as @xmath90 for @xmath91 .",
    "we also investigate the averaging operation for the analytic solution @xcite . in the analytic solution",
    ", temporal information is fully considered through the law of constant - areal velocity .",
    "in addition , one can use more points than @xmath92 for the averaging operations because less than @xmath93 averaged points are required for the orbit determination differently from the moment approach .",
    "therefore , it seems that the accuracy of the parameter determination by the analytic solution using the averaged points is better than that by the present approach .",
    "however , numerical calculations suggest that it is not the case . this is mainly because of two reasons : first , in the analytic solution",
    ", parameters of an apparent ellipse must be estimated before the determination of orbital elements , and these parameters can not be recovered well for an extremely low sn ratio . secondly , the eccentric anomaly @xmath10 that is needed for calculating areal velocities can not be recovered well . therefore , recovered values of the orbital elements can be complex numbers or quite different from the true values of them ( see table [ aak-2 ] ) , where complex numbers would suggest hyperbolic orbits rather than elliptic one .",
    "hence , we do not make a further comparison between the present moment approach and the inversion formula method .",
    "this paper improved the iwama+ approach for an extremely low sn ratio , where observational errors are comparable to or larger than a binary size . with avoiding a direct use of the time - consuming kepler equation , temporal information is taken into account to increase the accuracy of statistical moments .",
    "as numerical tests , 100 realizations are done and the mean and the standard deviation are also evaluated .",
    "for instance , the difference between the mean of the recovered values of the semi - major axis and the true value of that is decreased to less than a tenth in the case of @xmath0 observed points .",
    "therefore , when one has a number of the observed points , the present moment approach significantly improves the previous one for the orbit determinations . for cyg x-1",
    ", the semi - major axis is expected to be recovered with the accuracy comparable to , or smaller than the true value from astrometric observations alone .",
    "although the inversion formula by asada , akasaka , and kasai is also discussed , numerical calculations show that the averaging operation does not work well in the analytic method .",
    "it is more convenient to start with values that are recovered by the present moment approach and next use the steepest descent method for finally reaching the best - fit parameter values .",
    "it is left as a future work .",
