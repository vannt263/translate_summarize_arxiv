    "recently , considerable interest has been paid to  manganites that are characterized by a strong interplay of spin , charge and lattice degrees of freedom  @xcite .",

    "much effort has also been devoted to the compounds  substituted at the mn site .",
    "substitutions of the mn ion , which is at the heart of the double exchange ( de ) interaction , may contribute to the knowledge of the basic mechanism of cmr and also allows one to tune the characteristics of the compounds such as .",

    "a significant role has been attributed to the local elastic stress produced by the substituent and to its electronic and magnetic character . only a few studies concerned the optical properties  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present results of polarized raman scattering and an infrared reflectance study of ferromagnetic rhombohedral  compounds ( _ m _ = cr , co , cu , zn , sc or ga ) for several concentrations of the substituent ( @xmath1 = 0.02 , 0.04 , 0.06 , 0.08 , 0.1 for cr , co , cu and zn , @xmath1 = 0.1 for sc and @xmath1 = 0.08 for ga ) . in the compound ,",

    "polycrystalline , single phase  powders have been prepared by thermal decomposition of precursors obtained by a freeze - drying of acetic acid solutions . this soft procedure makes possible a strict control of stoichiometry , and allows us to keep the concentration of vacancies at the la and mn site practically negligible .",
    "pellets were prepared by pressing and sintering the powder at @xmath10c for 48  h. the values of the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath3 were selected according to the valence of the substituent in order to maintain the constant proportion of mn@xmath11/mn@xmath12 ions of about 32% , see table  [ tablexy ] .",
    "the valencies of the substituents were chosen as follows : sc@xmath12 ( the electron configuration 3@xmath13 ) , ga@xmath12 ( 3@xmath14 ) and zn@xmath15 ( 3@xmath14 ) ions are known to be the only possible states ; the valencies of cr@xmath12 ( 3@xmath16 ) , co@xmath12 ( 3@xmath17 ) ions are likely due to the charge neutrality condition .",
    "we have further assumed the valence state 2 + of cu ( 3@xmath18 ) because the 3 + state is rare .",
    "however , it is not excluded that the actual valency of cu is not integer and exceeds 2 + .",
    "x - ray powder diffraction patterns were completely indexed with rhombohedral perovskite cells . for further details of the sample preparation and results of the diffraction analysis",

    "the trend of increasing resistivity with increasing  distance is clearly visible ; the values corresponding to the large substituents , sc and zn , are significantly larger than those of the smaller ones .",
    "the resistivity of the cu - substituted compound is close to that of the group of smaller substituents .",
    "this is the same trend as indicated by the jt - like bands in the raman data",
    ".     compounds ( except for @xmath23 ga with @xmath24 ) extrapolated from the infrared data .",
    "the dashed line is shown to guide the eye.,width=264 ]    we explain the difference between the cu- and zn - substituted compound in terms of the occupancy of the @xmath25 orbitals as follows : the zn@xmath15 ion has fully occupied @xmath25 orbitals in contrast with the cu@xmath15 ion , that has one @xmath25 orbital empty .",
    "this orbital can acquire a conduction electron , and creates a nonzero magnetic moment that might enhance the ferromagnetism .",
    "however , the ga@xmath12 ion has the @xmath25 shell occupied and has no magnetic moment , but the samples belong to the low resistivity group .",
    "the ga substitution shows that the structural and electric properties of the compounds are mainly related to the substituent radius , and can be partially influenced by its electronic and magnetic structure ; this seems to be the case in the cu - substituted compound .",
    "alonso  @xcite suggested that an important factor influencing magnetic properties of the substituted manganites is the electrostatic potential created by the substituent . in this picture , because the average valence of the mn ions is 3.3 + , holes are attracted to the substituent with a lower valence ( 3 + or 2 + ) , and , consequently , the holes tend to localize and  decreases .",
    "if this effect were important , the  of the zn@xmath15-substituted sample would be significantly lower than that of the sc@xmath12-substituted compound , because the valence 2 + should localize holes more strongly than the valence 3 + . in our samples , however , the s of these compounds are nearly the same .",
    "this fact indicates that the influence of the electrostatic potential on the localization of holes is significantly less important than that of the local pressure .",
    "ghosh  @xcite studied the effects of mn substitutions by transition elements in la@xmath26ca@xmath27mno@xmath28 .",
    "it has been found that the changes of the maximum of magnetoresistance correlate with those of the lattice parameter , and that  correlates with the conductivity at .",
    "the latter result is basically confirmed by our studies .",
    "we have used raman and infrared spectroscopy , magnetic measurements , and x - ray analysis to study the influence of mn - site substitutions in optimally doped manganites .",
    "our results support the idea that the main factor influencing the oxygen disorder and electric and magnetic properties of these compounds is the radius of the substituents and that their electronic and magnetic structure plays only a minor role .",
    "our substituents form two groups , with the radii significantly larger than ( zn@xmath15 and sc@xmath12 ) , and similar to ( co@xmath12 , cr@xmath12 , ga@xmath12 ) , the average radius of the mn ions .",
    "the former group differs from the latter by the occurrence of jt - like bands in the raman spectra , reflecting an enhanced oxygen disorder , higher values of dc resistivity , and lower values of .",
    "this is in agreement with the picture proposed in the work of ghosh  @xcite on la@xmath29ca@xmath30mn@xmath31@xmath32o@xmath28 , suggesting that the local stress produced by the substitutional ion modifies the mn ",
    "o distances around the substitutional ion .",
    "this leads to changes of the energies of the @xmath33 orbitals , and to a localization of the itinerant electrons which competes with the de interaction .",
    "consequently , the jt disorder is enhanced , dc resistivity increases , and  decreases .",
    "these trends are weaker in the case of cu substitution although the ionic radius is close to that of zn and sc .",
    "it is possible that some additional effects due to the electronic or magnetic structure of cu enhance the mobility of electrons .",
    "the raman spectra exhibit an additional @xmath4-like mode that we attribute to the local breathing mode of oxygens in a close vicinity of the substituent ion .",
    "its frequency and intensity are very sensitive to the type of substituent .",
    "they seem to depend on the position of the substituent ion in the periodic table suggesting that the electronic characteristics of the  bond are important .",
    "however , the origin of these effects remains an open question for future studies .",
    "the mode of the co - substituted samples exhibits an anomalous softening of @xmath34 when going from 300 to 77 , which is likely due to the spin state transition of co.      a.d . acknowledges discussions and help of n.  garro , v.  kpek , d.  munzar and s.  valenda .",
