    "protons and neutrons are able to form bound nuclei with well defined lifetimes . they are finite and contain a relatively small number of nucleons which varies from one to several hundreds . the nucleons experience a strong short range interaction which acts together with the long range coulomb interaction between the charged protons .",
    "the interactions between nucleons determine the ground state properties and the low energy excitation spectrum of nuclei which have been studied over several decades .",
    "their description by means of very different collective and microscopic , semi - classical and quantum models has lead to a satisfactory understanding of their properties @xcite .    with increasing excitation energy the detailed information coded in the spectrum and the wave functions of the system gets less and less meaningful and stringent for a satisfactory description of the system .",
    "statistical arguments get relevant .",
    "random matrix theories , for instance , have proved to be a very efficient tool in this regime @xcite . under certain circumstances experiments",
    "reveal that the behaviour of nuclei can be described in the framework of thermodynamics .",
    "excited nuclei behave like equilibrated compounds which may decay through emission of gamma rays , nucleons or light clusters at energies corresponding to unbound states of the system @xcite .",
    "the behaviour of nuclei in this regime and its description in terms of thermodynamic and statistical concepts leads to intriguing questions related to the general properties of thermodynamically equilibrated nuclear matter , either finite like nuclei or ( quasi)infinite as it could be found in neutron stars , in the absence of the gravitational interaction .",
    "these questions are also triggered by the fact that nucleons are fermions and nuclear matter in its ground state , at zero temperature , shows the properties of a fermi liquid of strongly interacting particles @xcite . for high enough excitation energy it seems sensible to think that such a quantum liquid may go over to a quantum gas by undergoing a phase transition which would be observable in a infinite system and for which one would find characteristic signals in finite nuclei .",
    "this question has become a major source of interest over the last two decades in the nuclear physics community . the only way to get an experimental answer to it goes through energetic collisions between nuclei or nucleons and nuclei with the aim to generate excited finite nuclear matter .",
    "the analysis of the experiments must then be able to reveal its properties and eventually deliver signs for the existence of one or several phase transitions in the infinite system .",
    "such ambitious objectives have led to intense experimental and theoretical investigations .",
    "several reports have been written on the subject over the last ten years . in the present review",
    "we aim to discuss two aspects concerning excited nuclear matter .",
    "the first concerns the conditions under which it is experimentally generated . the second deals with specific microscopic models which we think allow a realistic study and description of experimental facts under the prerequisite that the physical conditions imposed by the experiment match those which are imposed by the theory .",
    "the content of the present review is the following . in section 2",
    "we describe the status of the subject at the beginning of the early 80 s .",
    "we present and discuss the attempts to interpret experimental results related to energetic heavy ion collisions and the theoretical models which were aimed to describe the outcome of such collisions , the fragmentation of the involved nuclei .",
    "we then turn over in section 3 to the two major points which have to be taken in account in order to be able to compare experimental results with the type of models which will be introduced .",
    "these points concern the finiteness of the system and the problems related to its properties with respect to the concept of thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the outcome of very energetic nuclear collisions .",
    "nuclei can break up into pieces .",
    "fragments with different sizes , mass and charge numbers , are generated . with the presently available detection instruments they can be recorded .",
    "their charge and , to some extent , their mass can be measured .",
    "charge and mass distributions as well as related quantities are a priori non - trivial observables which contain interesting information about the fragmentation process and the behaviour of excited nuclear matter .",
    "we present and discuss the concepts and models which have been introduced in order to describe the fragmentation characteristics of nuclei , as well as the possible reasons for which rather simple - minded models describe these observables with a remarkable success . in section 5",
    "we introduce microscopic statistical models which may behave as generic approaches for the study of the thermodynamic properties of excited systems composed of interacting nucleons .",
    "these models have either been borrowed from other fields of physics or consist of adapted derivatives of these models .",
    "they describe systems which show phase transitions and whose outcome can be confronted with experimental data . since they are finite , tests which enable to characterize the phase transitions have been proposed .",
    "some of these tests are introduced in section 6 and their application both on theoretical models as well as experimental results are presented and discussed in the perspective of the existence of a phase transition in excited nuclear matter . in section 7",
    "we develop a summary , comment the present status of the field and suggest perspectives which may lead to further progress in the field .    nuclear fragmentation and the search of phase transitions is a very active field of research .",
    "this is best seen by looking at the number of preprints and publications which appear regularly .",
    "we tried to cover the newest results concerning the aspects of the subject with which the present report is concerned , extending to summer 2000 .",
    "we also tried to be as exhaustive as possible in the presentation and quotation of the work which has been done .",
    "we apologize for the contributions which could have been forgotten because of lack of information about their existence .",
    "finite nuclei in their ground state and low - lying excited states have been studied for over 50 years .",
    "they are still objects of interest , in particular the so called exotic nuclei which contain a larger number of protons or neutrons than those which lie in the so called valley of stability .",
    "these objects can be conceptually considered as finite representatives of infinite nuclear matter which may be realized in large objects of our universe like neutron stars where nucleons experience of course both the nuclear and gravitational interactions , the last one being absent from our present considerations .",
    "extensive theoretical studies of the ground state properties of infinite nuclear matter have been pursued over several decades .",
    "they were essentially aimed to determine the non relativistic nucleon - nucleon interaction which originates from meson exchanges between nucleons .",
    "its precise expression can be fixed by means of nucleon - nucleon scattering amplitudes @xcite .",
    "different expressions of this interaction have been introduced in order to construct effective interactions used in detailed spectroscopic studies of the ground state and low excited states of nuclei , see f.i .",
    "@xcite .    at high enough excitation energy , nuclei which form liquid drops of fermions get unstable .",
    "it is tempting to trace a parallel with the behaviour of macroscopic liquids and to conjecture that the nuclear liquid may go over into vapour and that there may exist a transition from a liquid to a gas under precise thermodynamic conditions , in the limit of an infinite system .",
    "but this is not necessarily the case , the evolution with increasing energy could well correspond to a smooth crossover from a bound to an unbound system of interacting particles .",
    "the question whether nuclear matter may exist in different phases is one of the important questions raised by the nuclear community and a central point of the present review .",
    "the first serious attempts to answer this question started about two decades ago .",
    "experimental information about excited nuclear matter can only be gained through accelerator induced nuclear reactions by means of which excited nuclei can be generated and studied .",
    "energetic beams of particles or heavy ions shot on nuclei lead to their fragmentation into pieces .",
    "the final multiplicity of fragments of different sizes which are collected by the detectors is correlated with the degree of violence of the collision . to our knowledge ,",
    "the first experiment which was concerned with the possible observation of signs related to a phase transition in nuclei was performed in 1982 by minich et al .",
    "protons with energies between 80 and @xmath2 were shot on xenon and krypton targets .",
    "the resulting experimentally detected fragments with @xmath3 nucleons @xmath4 and @xmath5 protons led to fragment yields @xmath6 which could be parametrized in the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a positive exponent and @xmath9 a boltzmann factor which depends on a temperature @xmath10 and further constants which were fixed by a fit procedure to the experimental data . expression ( [ minc ] ) was in fact inspired by fisher s droplet model @xcite which for the pupose of the analysis was generalized to two types of particles , neutrons and protons .",
    "the value of the critical exponent extracted from the fit of the data was @xmath11 and 2.65 for xenon and krypton respectively .",
    "it has to be compared to the value @xmath12 obtained in mean field theory @xcite .",
    "fisher s condensation theory predicts that the transition from a liquid to a gas proceeds via the formation of droplets whose size distribution follows a power law at the critical transition point .",
    "the authors do not claim that these results would be a proof for the existence of a critical behaviour but that they are consistent with it .",
    "following the droplet model , the increase in excitation energy would generate instabilities in nuclear matter and would lead , at some critical temperature @xmath13 , to the disassembly of the system , which is here finite , into smaller pieces of all sizes which are experimentally detected .",
    "this pioneering experiment has been prolongated in further work which was pursued by panagiotou et al . @xcite .",
    "the authors introduced a systematic study of twelve different high energy reactions induced by protons and carbon ions on ag , kr , xe and u targets .",
    "they measured fragment yields corresponding to nuclei with @xmath14 .",
    "using the same point of view as in ref .",
    "@xcite the yields of fragments of size @xmath3 were parametrized in the explicit form @xmath15/t\\ } \\nonumber \\\\ & = & a^{-k}x^{a^{2/3}}y^a \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 \\nonumber\\ ] ] and @xmath17 \\nonumber\\ ] ] here @xmath10 is the temperature of the fragmenting system ,",
    "@xmath18 are the surface , volume free energy per particle and the chemical potential respectively .",
    "@xmath10 was determined independently for the different systems by different means @xcite . under the assumption that there exists a critical temperature @xmath13 at which @xmath19 vanishes",
    ", the different quantities were further parametrized as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a coefficient which has to be fixed . for @xmath22 where the gas and liquid coexist @xmath23 @xmath24 at @xmath25 .",
    "furthermore @xmath26 @xmath27 for @xmath28 one assumes that @xmath29 .",
    "the expression @xmath30 was fitted to the experimental data in order to fix @xmath21 and @xmath13 , for different values of @xmath31 ( = 1.6 - 2.33 ) and in a temperature range @xmath32 where @xmath10 is the supposed common temperature of all emitted fragments .",
    "the values of @xmath10 were chosen within an interval of @xmath33 in order to take the uncertainty related to this quantity in account . if one fixes the critical temperature to the lowest value of @xmath34 in a parametrization @xmath35 where @xmath8 is a so called apparent exponent , then the fitted value of @xmath13 coincides for @xmath36 with @xmath37 .",
    "further analysis of the same type @xcite confirmed these results , i.e. a critical temperature which lies in the range 9.5 - 13.5 @xmath38 and an exponent @xmath31 smaller than 2 .",
    "the model which is aimed to reproduce the outcome of the fragmentation reactions presented above presupposes that the process can be described in the framework of thermodynamics and the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "it assumes that the fragmenting system is in thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "this assumption is strong since it implies that there exists a relaxation time which is not longer than the time interval which separates the beginning of the process and the time at which fragments are formed .",
    "we shall come back to this point at different places below .",
    "the system undergoes a phase transition at a characteristic temperature @xmath13 . for @xmath22 a gas and a liquid coexist .",
    "the liquid phase is made of particles and composite droplets ( fragments ) whose energy is composed of a volume and a surface contribution . at @xmath39",
    "the surface contribution disappears , the droplets disassemble into independent nucleons , hence form an homogeneous gas phase which is reached for @xmath40 .",
    "taking the problem of thermal equilibrium apart , further thinking about this attractive picture leads to the following comments .",
    "first , the data analysis is restricted to a finite range in the size of fragments .",
    "light and heavy species are not taken in account .",
    "this may introduce a bias which is not under control .",
    "it has to be noticed that the exponents @xmath8 and @xmath31 which were obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite do not coincide with the exponent expected from the fisher model which describes classical and infinite systems .",
    "finite size effects should play a role in the determination of critical exponents , here they are not taken in account .",
    "finally fragments and particles are free , i.e. they do not interact with each other . even if the nuclear interaction is weak at the fragmentation stage because the system has already expanded , the coulomb energy is present and certainly non negligible . hence it should be taken into account .    at this stage , even though there were encouraging signs for the existence of a critical behaviour of nuclear matter , it appeared that the observed phenomenon was not reducible to an ordinary liquid - gas phase transition as described by fisher s droplet model .",
    "however , these first steps and the concepts they introduced paved the way to a huge amount of theoretical work which we shall briefly describe below , as far as the existence of different phases is concerned .      here",
    "we restrict ourselves to those approaches which have been introduced as stationary and non - stationary descriptions of finite excited systems .",
    "they were aimed to describe the response and fate of nuclei when energy is imparted to them .",
    "the droplet model @xcite is a classical and phenomenological description of an excited , inhomogeneous and unstable matter phase .",
    "the most common approximation introduced in the framework of the quantum many - body problem is hartree - fock theory in which nucleons move in a self - consistent mean field which can be described by an effective density - dependent interaction .",
    "this framework has been used up to the present time for the study of static nuclear properties , a detailed review of its applications can be found f.i . in @xcite and",
    "references therein .",
    "the theory has been extended to the study of systems at finite temperature in the framework of the canonical and grand canonical ensembles @xcite . using point contact and density - dependent effective interactions like skyrme interactions it is easy to derive explicit expressions of different equations of state such as the expression of the pressure @xmath41 as a function of the density @xmath42 for different values of the temperature @xmath10 .",
    "the typical behaviour of these quantities is presented in fig .",
    "one observes the existence of an area limited by an envelope , the spinodal line , where the pressure decreases with increasing density .",
    "this is the signal for the presence of an instability of matter which corresponds to the formation of an inhomogeneous medium .",
    "it is interpreted as a zone where liquid and gas coexist and which is not thermodynamically accessible .",
    "the transition from an homogeneous to the unstable regime corresponds to a first order phase transition in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the transition is of second order at the critical point corresponding to the critical temperature @xmath13 , at the maximum of the spinodal line where @xmath43 .",
    "this behaviour establishes a connection with the droplet model physics .",
    "condensation has been studied in this framework @xcite .",
    "the calculations fix the critical density @xmath44 and the critical temperatures .",
    "the presence and importance of the coulomb interaction was first taken into account by levit and bonche @xcite who introduced a description in which the system is composed of a bound , excited nucleus surrounded by an external gas made of light particles in thermal equilibrium with the nucleus .",
    "the presence of the long range coulomb force produces a sizable qualitative effect .",
    "it results in the apparition of a so called limiting temperature , @xmath45 , which restricts the instability zone to temperatures which are lower than @xmath13 and hence introduces an important modification .",
    "similar investigations were performed in refs .",
    "@xcite with different skyrme interactions and refinements concerning , in particular , the treatment of the vapour charge .",
    "the temperature - dependent hartree - fock approach with density - dependent effective interactions is a simple and elegant approximation to the many - body problem of finite excited systems . a priori it is possible to find the correspondence with central ingredients of the droplet model like the concept of surface in the liquid phase .",
    "it is however difficult to control the degree of realism of these microscopic quantum approaches .",
    "the fact that the process is described in the framework of the canonical or grand canonical ensemble when the fragmenting system is closed and has a fixed and small number of particles may lead to difficulties in the characterization of the transition .",
    "we shall come back to this point in the sequel .",
    "there are no means to obtain fragment yields which could be compared to the experiment since there are only two types of species , a bound nucleus and light particles which constitute respectively the liquid and the vapour phases .",
    "this is of course directly related to a major difficulty which comes from the mean field description .",
    "the phases are homogeneous .",
    "many - body correlations induced by the neglected residual two - body interactions are absent , but their effect is very important at the considered excitation energies .",
    "this may also explain the high values of the temperature @xmath46 where the system becomes unstable .",
    "indeed , the interpretation of experiments indicates that these temperatures could be much lower , of the order of @xmath47 .",
    "hence this kind of approach is at most indicative for the determination of the properties of finite excited nuclear matter in thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "it worked however as an incentive to develop more realistic approaches which take explicitly care of the many - body aspect of the problem .",
    "we describe some of them below .",
    "the general microscopic framework describing energetic collisions leading to the decay of the system into species of all sizes is the quantum many - body scattering theory . in this fundamental approach",
    "the scattering @xmath48-matrix elements @xmath49 measure the overlap between any arbitrary many - body initial scattering state @xmath50 with any arbitrary final state @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "a full fledged microscopic approach of this type is however hopelessly out of scope because of its mathematical intricancy .",
    "many pragmatic ways have been devised in order to circumvent this problem .",
    "they all rely on non relativistic formalisms in which non nucleonic degrees of freedom are parametrized by means of nucleon - nucleon potentials .",
    "all approaches which have been used in a time - dependent framework contain a minimum of classical ingredients .",
    "indeed , all of them fix initial conditions at an initial time and follow the evolution of the system up to a final time in contradistinction with scattering theory which specifies both the initial and the final state of the system .",
    "it is not necessarily clear that classical concepts and assumptions should work in the present physical context , except for the fact that high energy processes are correlated with short wavelengths .",
    "one may however notice that processes like deep - inelastic or fission reactions which occur at lower collision energies can be reasonably and surprisingly well reproduced in terms of classical ( or semi - classical ) equations of motion @xcite .",
    "an explicit time - dependent description generally called `` dynamic '' description shows a priori a further advantage , since it allows to avoid the crucial point concerning thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "indeed , the dynamical description of the evolution of the system may lead or not to thermodynamic equilibrium which follows a transient period of time in a collision process .",
    "there exists essentially two classes of models of this type .",
    "the first one transcribes the many - body equations of motion into kinetic equations of motion for the one - particle phase - space distribution function @xmath52 at point @xmath53 with momentum @xmath54 .",
    "each phase space cell @xmath55,[\\vec p,\\vec p + { \\mathrm{d}}\\vec p]\\}$ ] evolves in time through the transport equation @xmath56 \\label{transp}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is a one - body potential and @xmath58 $ ] , the so called collision term contains in principle all the information relative to @xmath59body correlations which are generated by the two - body ( possibly also @xmath60body ) potentials beyond the average field @xmath61 .",
    "this quantity and @xmath58 $ ] are in principle correlated and fixed in the framework of the initial many - body equation of motion in such a way as to satisfy conservation laws . in practice",
    "however they are determined through phenomenological considerations which preserve more or less the quantal aspects of the initial problem .",
    "these approximations are particularly tricky for @xmath58 $ ] which has to be chosen in such a way that it can be expressed in terms of one - body distributions , in order to ensure the closed form of ( [ transp ] ) @xcite .",
    "the mean field potential @xmath61 is generally fixed independently , from purely phenomenological formulations to self - consistent density - dependent expressions derived by means of static hartree - fock calculations . as a consequence , a large amount of models of the type of eq .",
    "( [ transp ] ) have been proposed in the litterature , see @xcite and refs . therein .",
    "they have been used as descriptions of many - body systems , among which high energy nuclear collisions .",
    "it is not our aim to give a detailed report on the achievements of these descriptions .",
    "it has been done in different publications and reports , see the references above . here",
    "we want to restrict the subject to the discussion of some aspects of nuclear fragmentation which have been addressed in this framework .",
    "they are of interest for the understanding of the fragmentation process and problems related to thermodynamic equilibrium , the possible existence and ( or ) the coexistence of phases in nuclear matter .    in the formulation of eq .",
    "( [ transp ] ) the mean field @xmath61 plays an essential role and its choice is central for a realistic description of the evolution of the system at high energy . as we have seen in section 2.2.1 , realistic mean field calculations in the framework of hartree - fock theory with effective density - dependent potentials @xmath61 and the equation of state @xmath62 lead to a zone of instability and possibly of metastability whose separation from pure `` liquid '' and `` gas '' phases corresponds to the existence of a first order phase transition , see fig .  [ fig1 ] .",
    "transport equations may be considered as time - dependent extensions of mean field approaches which furthermore avoid the problem of the existence or not of thermal equilibrium in the expanding and decaying system .",
    "much work has been done in this framework in order to identify the existence and consequences of an instability zone where the initially homogeneous system gets inhomogeneous and appears as formed of clusters which can be identified @xcite .",
    "this has indeed been achieved in a pure mean field approximation , in the absence of the collision term , when the mean field is supposed to possess a fluctuating contribution @xcite , and ( or ) when the collision term induces fluctuations in the one - body distribution function @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "these fluctuations develop collective modes like zero sound , some of which are unstable and break the system @xcite .",
    "the expansion of the system affects also the development of the instabilities .",
    "the presence of two types of particles , protons and neutrons has been taken into account @xcite and comparisons with experimental results have been made @xcite .",
    "quantum effects on the expansion dynamics have been investigated recently .",
    "it comes out that they are non negligible , especially when the energy of the collective modes which develop in the system are larger than the temperature @xcite .",
    "this approach which describes the fragmentation of nuclei as a mechanical process shows however limitations due to the already mentioned fact that eq .",
    "( [ transp ] ) is an approximation to the many - body problem whose expression allows for many more or less controlled phenomenological ingredients , such as stochastic contributions in the mean field and ( or ) the collision term .",
    "these are supposed to simulate the missing many - body features .",
    "unfortunately it is difficult to control their degree of consistency , much physical information is hidden in numerics and may obscure the conclusions which can be drawn from comparisons with the experiment . on the other hand",
    "one can believe that transport models of the type given by eq .",
    "( [ transp ] ) are able to describe the time evolution of global observables like inclusive reaction cross sections and collective properties like flow @xcite .",
    "the second approach concerns molecular dynamics .",
    "it is also an approximation to the time - dependent many - body problem .",
    "different formulations starting from the most classical one , classical molecular dynamics ( cmd ) try to pick up quantal aspects at different levels , going from `` quantum '' molecular dynamics ( qmd ) which tries to approximate the many - body wave function at the initial time by means of coherent ( gaussian ) states and takes care of the pauli principle @xcite to the more recent fermion molecular dynamics ( fmd ) @xcite and antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd ) @xcite which introduce the antisymmetrization of wave functions in a semi - classical way .    in the simplest form ( cmd ) the time evolution of the system",
    "is described in terms of classical equations of motion for protons and neutrons which interact through a two - body potential representing the nuclear interaction and the coulomb force which acts between protons .",
    "these interactions are implemented in such a way that the fundamental ground state properties of real nuclei are reproduced .",
    "the effects of the pauli principle can be mimicked by means of a momentum - dependent potential @xcite .",
    "applications of this formalism have been developed into different directions .",
    "we shall come back in the forthcoming section to the description of heavy ion collisions in which theoretically calculated and experimental determined observables are confronted in order to fix the possible relationship between fragmentation and phases in nuclear matter . here",
    "we concentrate on applications in which molecular dynamics ( md ) has been implemented in order to study the properties of a thermalized system for which the velocity distributions of particles are maxwellians .",
    "from there on the system evolves in time by expansion for different initial values of the temperature and the density @xcite one follows the evolution of the temperature , the pressure and the fragment size distribution of the system with decreasing density .",
    "fragments can be identified by means of different criteria which may be more or less realistic @xcite . in some cases",
    "the system crosses the spinodal line and enters the instability zone .",
    "different observables show a behaviour which can be interpreted in terms of fisher s droplet model , i.e. a fragment size distribution corresponding to a power law corrected for finite size effects and a corresponding critical exponent @xmath63 2.2 to 2.3 , which goes over to other characteristic shapes for other choices of the temperature as expected in the droplet theory , see fig .",
    "these results along with the interpretation of other observables which will be defined below are interpreted as the outcome of a realistic simulation of the experimental situation and the sign for the existence of a critical behaviour of the system . the role and importance of the coulomb interaction",
    "has been investigated @xcite .",
    "molecular dynamics has also been used in order to construct the equation of state @xcite , i.e. the thermodynamic properties which link density , pressure and temperature .",
    "it is again shown that there exists a critical point for finite systems , and a power law distribution with @xmath64 which can be interpreted in the framework of fisher s model",
    ".    however these results and conclusions concerning criticality have been put in question by another study @xcite which claims that the observed signs have not to be interpreted as being related to a critical behaviour but for the existence of an intermediate regime .",
    "this behaviour would correspond to a trajectory in the @xmath65 plane on which the evolving system does neither fall back to a drop nor develop into a gas .",
    "a power law distribution can be extracted from the data .",
    "the power law exponent depends sensitively on the initial temperature and the size of the system . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is claimed that the power law behaviour of mass yields expected for a system close to its critical point would be purely accidental .",
    "time - dependent transport descriptions of nuclear fragmentation seem a priori to be the most realistic way to the description of high energy nuclear collisions .",
    "they have been widely used in order to describe the possible out - of - equilibrium character of the fragmentation process which characterizes at least the first stage of the process @xcite . in the present section we concentrated on aspects related to a time - dependent description of thermodynamically equilibrated systems which expand and cool down , exploring different regions of the @xmath66 and @xmath65 planes .",
    "calculations show that the results can be interpreted as the entrance of the system into a thermodynamic unstable regime .",
    "it seems however not clear how this can effectively be related to the existence of a phase transition which would characterize an equilibrated system heated up in a fixed volume . in an interpretation in which the system gets critical",
    "it is claimed that it is possible to extract critical exponents , at least the power law exponent @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "however this quantity is obtained from finite size systems and hence should be corrected for finite size effects .",
    "the time coordinate which is introduced in these descriptions raises the question of time scales , i.e. the question concerning equilibration in energetic light particle reactions or heavy ion collisions .",
    "this is the subject of section 3 .",
    "last but not necessarily least , all these time - dependent approaches need a detailed description of the dynamics in terms of more or less sophisticated mean field and two - body potentials .",
    "it is always difficult to get a clear feeling for the sensivity of the outcome of numerical calculations and simulations to these details .",
    "paradoxically , it is at criticality that the information on microscopic systems is the less sensitive to the details of the hamiltonians which govern them .",
    "finally it is worthwhile to mention here that it has been shown recently @xcite that even far - from - equilibrium , spatially chaotic systems can show equilibrium properties such as ergodicity ( equivalence between time and ensemble averages ) , detailed balance in microscopic processes , partition functions and renormalization group flow at coarse - grained lengths between microscopic and macroscopic scales .",
    "this suggests that it might be possible to describe the global behaviour of some far - from - equilibrium systems in the framework of equilibrium statistical mechanisms .",
    "whether this result could be some clue to the actual question raised in the present framework is an open and highly interesting question .",
    "if an isolated system of particles is such that there is no unbalanced force acting between its constituents and if it does not experience internal structure changes of its constituents it is said to be in mechanical and chemical equilibrium .",
    "thermal equilibrium is realized if the relevant degrees of freedom which characterize the system share equally its macroscopic energy .",
    "one can then define a common temperature which characterizes the energy attributed to each degree of freedom .",
    "when all three conditions are realized the system is said to be in thermodynamic equilibrium @xcite and can be described in terms of macroscopic coordinates , the thermodynamic coordinates like density , pressure and temperature which do not change with time and are linked together through equations of state . in the present section we aim to present and discuss the difficult and for a large part unsettled problem of thermodynamic equilibrium in small systems like nuclei excited by means of energetic collisions between particles or nuclei called heavy ions if their mass is larger than 4 . in section 3.1 we discuss questions related to the interval of time over which equilibrium can be reached in terms of model estimates . a confrontation between experimental facts and phase space equilibrium models",
    "is presented in section 3.2 .      what is the scenario which governs energetic collisions ?",
    "data analysis and their interpretation show that several scenarii are at hand .",
    "typically one expects that part of the bombarding energy is transferred to the internal degrees of freedom of the system , the system may fall into pieces , particles and fragments , and expand in time .",
    "the remnants are then collected at asymptotic distances in detectors which identify their charges and eventually their masses , along with their kinetic energies and distributions in space .",
    "the setting up of thermodynamic equilibrium over the whole or part of the interacting system of particles is a central but open question . under favorable circumstances",
    "one may figure out that after some transient interval of time which starts at the beginning of the collision the system reaches at least partial equilibrium at some stage and then expands to infinity .      at very low projectile energies the excitation of nuclei by means of light particles can lead to the formation of an excited complex whose",
    "behaviour can be interpreted within the framework of thermodynamics as a system in thermodynamic equilibrium and which can loose part of its excitation energy through the emission of particles , photons or through symmetric or asymmetric fission .",
    "the complex is the so called compound nucleus whose formation and decay properties were already studied in the 30 s by n. bohr @xcite who conjectured that , in the framework of this scenario , the process can be explained as a two step mechanism in which the decay of the equilibrated system would be totally uncorrelated from the way it was generated . from a theoretical point of view compound nucleus theory is a phenomenological approach .",
    "it has been largely investigated and worked out in terms of microscopic models , among others random matrix theory .",
    "there exists an extended litterature on this subject which covers several decades of intensive work @xcite .",
    "indeed , the consequences of the model have been abundantly verified by means of physical observables like excitation functions and angular distributions of emitted particles @xcite .",
    "the lifetime @xmath8 of the compound system can in principle be read from the compound nucleus decay width @xmath67 through @xmath68 leading to @xmath69 depending in particular on the size of the system .",
    "these times are substantially larger than @xmath70 corresponding to the time necessary to light to cross a nucleus of diameter @xmath71 .    at higher energies , above the coulomb barrier which corresponds to bombarding energies per particle @xmath72 , reactions involving heavy ions lead to a new mechanism the so called deep inelastic collision ( dic ) process .",
    "typical contact times during which the projectile and the target interact through the short range nuclear potential are much shorter than compound nucleus decay times , of the order of @xmath73 , not much larger than the contact time in so called direct reactions in which the ions strike each other peripherally in typical time intervals of @xmath74 .",
    "the interpretation of physical observables measured in these dics shows that although the characteristic reaction times are quite short , the complex which is formed over the contact time of the two ions is sufficient to transfer sizable amounts of energy from the relative motion between ions into the excitation of the nucleonic degrees of freedom and the characteristic features of the system can be interpreted in terms of an equilibrated system whose equilibration is reached in as short as some units of @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "how does this behaviour extrapolate to high energy events which can lead to the fragmentation of the system into many pieces of different sizes ?",

    "the authors emphasize the fact that thermal equilibrium , requested by a classical collision time between nucleons which is short compared to the expansion time of the nucleon gas , may not be established at a time where the system is already dilute , a regime which is reached after a very short characteristic time which is smaller than @xmath74 .",
    "this goes in the same direction as the non equilibrium @xmath77 which was experimentally found .",

    "it characterizes a system which is mechanically unstable and decays into fragments .",

    "it is expected that fragments which are emitted quasi - simultaneously show a close to isotropic emission in the centre of mass system , hence are spherical in shape , whereas emission times which are long as it may be in the case of sequential emission would correspond to the existence of an elongated emission axis , hence an ellipsoidal shape .",
    "experimental events were confronted with numerical simulations .",
    "it comes out that for energies below @xmath110 the fragmentation process is slow . for higher energies ,",
    "the experimental momentum distributions lie in between the predictions corresponding to a slow and a quasi simultaneous break - up process .",
    "even though the result does not give any quantitative clue to the problem , it shows at least that the characteristic fragmentation time decreases with increasing energy .",
    "a fragmentation experiment induced by @xmath111 at @xmath110 @xcite confronted with different models related to quick and slow processes confirms the fact that ordinary binary sequential decay may not be the appropriate fragmentation mechanism .",

    "on the other hand , the use of the concepts of statistical mechanisms has shown that paradoxically the most complex systems can be described in terms of minimum information theories which bypass the detailed knowledge of the underlying microscopic systems . here",
    "it may be tempting to follow this philosophy and to try to describe the outcome of nuclear fragmentation processes within the simplest possible physical framework .",
    "this has been done starting in the early 80 s by means of minimum information approaches like percolation models .",
    "these models ground on purely topological and statistical concepts , they avoid the explicit introduction of hamiltonians . if they work , they raise of course the question why and how this is the case .    in percolation theories ,",
    "space contains empty regions and parts which are occupied by individual objects which can be considered as bound to form larger entities defined by means of different criteria .",
    "the essential concepts are connectivity , localization and percolation which characterizes the properties of clusters ( animals , fragments ) .",
    "percolation itself is established when , in an infinite space , at least one cluster of infinite size is present .",
    "percolation models have been used in many fields which deal with geometry , disorder , statistics and physics such as aggregation , localization , diffusion , conductivity  before going over to its application in the field of nuclear fragmentation it may be worthwhile to recall general concepts , definitions and properties which appear in the framework of this type of descriptions .",
    "the first percolation model was introduced by broadbent and hammersley @xcite in order to describe the spread of matter through a medium such as a liquid through a porous medium .",
    "it was then soon recognized that this type of model is acquainted to already known models like the ising model @xcite and other statistical spin models like those developed by ashkin and teller @xcite and potts @xcite .",
    "all these descriptions can be studied in a general framework called random - cluster model .",
    "this has been worked out by fortuin and kasteleyn @xcite . in the first paper @xcite",
    "the authors showed the close connection between the connectivity problem of different systems with uncorrelated bonds between sites which are occupied by single objects ( particles ) and the well known ising model .",
    "since ising systems exhibit phase transitions in @xmath192 and @xmath193 spaces it is not surprising that the random - cluster model shows itself a phase transition in the infinite space limit . in later developments",
    "@xcite the authors studied the general topological properties of the aforementioned models by means of graph theory , in particular those of the random - cluster model .",
    "they showed why the models quoted in refs .",
    "@xcite as well as linear resistance networks and percolation models can be studied in a unique framework by means of graphs defined in terms of vertices ( sites ) , edges ( bonds ) , connections between edges and vertices , and probabilities @xmath106 for edges to exist or not . in practice",
    "they introduced a generalized partition function ( cluster generation function ) and `` free energy '' which enables to work out physical observables like thermodynamic quantities in the case of the ising , ashkin - teller and potts models and correlation functions .",
    "further analytical developments on percolation models were pursued by kunz and souillard @xcite related to previous work by e.h .",
    "lieb . in the case where sites do not interact , i.e. are not correlated , they introduced the free energy @xmath194 where @xmath106 is the bond probability , @xmath195 , @xmath196 the probability that a given site belongs to a cluster with exactly @xmath169 sites , @xmath197 are all finite clusters containing the origin of space @xmath198 , @xmath199 is the size of the clusters and @xmath200 the size of the boundary of clusters , i.e. their perimeters ( surfaces ) .",
    "the study of the properties of @xmath201 shows that this function is analytic for @xmath202 and @xmath203 , and develops a singularity for @xmath204 if the system is infinite , indicating a phase transition of second order at @xmath205 . for @xmath204",
    "the system percolates in the sense defined above , i.e. at least one cluster of infinite size appears .      before discussing the applications of percolation concepts to nuclear fragmentation",
    "we present here some essential properties of percolation models we shall need in the sequel .",
    "percolation models consist of a discrete number of sites which cover a finite or infinite part of a @xmath137-dimensional space @xcite .",
    "site percolation corresponds to the case where each site is either occupied by one `` particle '' or is empty .",
    "bond percolation corresponds to the case where each site is occupied , neighbouring sites being bound or not to each other .",
    "the number of neighbouring sites is fixed by the connectivity which depends on the geometric structure of space occupation ( f.i . a triangular lattice for @xmath206 , a cubic lattice for @xmath207 ,  ) .",
    "the combination of site occupation and bond formation leads to hybrid site - bond models .    except for the results presented in section 4.1 above @xcite ,",
    "very little is known analytically about these models .",
    "most information has been gained by means of numerical simulations .",
    "in the case of site percolation , one fixes a probability @xmath208 $ ] .",
    "for each site , one draws a random number @xmath209 taken from a uniform distribution in the interval @xmath210 $ ] .",
    "if @xmath211 the site is said to be occupied , if @xmath212 it is empty .",
    "hopping over all sites , one generates an ensemble of occupied and empty sites .",
    "if the number @xmath140 of sites gets very large , one finds @xmath213 occupied and @xmath214 empty sites .",
    "if neighbouring sites are occupied they belong to the same cluster .",
    "space is finally covered with clusters and empty space .",
    "a similar procedure works in the case of bond percolation . for a fixed bond probability @xmath106 consider a pair of neighbouring sites and draw a random number @xmath215",
    "$ ] . if @xmath211 the sites are linked by a bond , if @xmath212 they are not .",
    "testing this way all possible bonds between neighbouring sites generates linked clusters of bound sites , each cluster being made up of an ensemble of connected particles .",
    "the determination of the whole cluster network will be called event or realization . in each realization",
    "there are clusters of different sizes .",
    "they appear with a given multiplicity which depends of course on @xmath106 .",
    "averaging over many realizations leads to a characteristic cluster size distribution in the infinite system .    clusters with a fixed size can have different shapes for @xmath216 .",
    "the average number of clusters of size @xmath217 per lattice site taken over a set of realizations is given by @xmath218 where @xmath219 is the number of clusters with size @xmath217 and perimeter @xmath220 , the perimeter being the number of empty ( non connected ) sites which surround the cluster .",
    "generally @xmath219 is not analytically accessible .",
    "we shall come back to this point below .",
    "individual clusters of size @xmath220 can also be characterized by a `` gyration '' radius @xmath221 , defined by @xmath222 is the centre of mass of the cluster .",
    "then the average squared distance between two cluster sites is @xmath223 if @xmath224 is the probability that a site which is a distance @xmath217 apart from an occupied site belongs to the same cluster , one can define a correlation length @xmath225 such that @xcite @xmath226 @xmath227 is the average distance between two sites of a cluster and @xmath228 the probability that a site belongs to a cluster of size @xmath220 .",
    "since such a site is connected to @xmath220 other sites the correlation distance @xmath225 can be rewritten as @xmath229 as it has been mentioned above @xcite there appears a percolation ( second order ) phase transition for @xmath216 and some value @xmath230 . for @xmath231 one or several infinite clusters",
    "are present .",
    "the system is said to percolate .",
    "the value of @xmath232 depends on the dimensionality of the system , the type of percolation ( site or bond ) and its connectivity ( the number of maximum occupied sites in the next neighbourhood of a site or possible bonds of a site to the nearest neighbours ) @xcite .",
    "the central observable in percolation physics is of course the cluster size distribution . in practice , nothing is known analytically about it , except for conjectures which agree very precisely with numerical simulations . for @xmath203 and clusters of large size @xmath233 , i.e. one observes an exponential tail when space occupation ( site percolation ) or the number of bonds ( bond percolation ) is sparse . for @xmath231 and @xmath234 .",
    "as one can see the space dimension enters in the case where space occupation or the number of bonds is large .",
    "this is not the case in the non percolative regime .",
    "finally for @xmath235 and large clusters it has been conjectured @xcite that @xmath236 which is true for all percolation models , @xmath8 and @xmath237 being universal exponents and @xmath51 a model dependent function . for @xmath238 , leading to a power law behaviour which intriguinly reminds fisher s expression ( [ minc ] ) . as stated above , these relations are very accurately verified by numerical tests .      for infinite systems it is possible to work out the expression of the cluster size distribution @xmath239 in the vicinity of the critical point @xmath205 .    by definition the @xmath31th moment is @xmath240 going over to the continuum limit @xmath241 and introducing the analytical expression ( [ def - n ] ) with @xmath242 for @xmath106 in the vicinity of @xmath243 leads to @xmath244 for @xmath245 one sees that the moments diverge at @xmath205 , a sign for the existence of a phase transition .",
    "hence , if @xmath246 which is the case for @xmath247 @xmath248 for @xmath249 in a cubic lattice @xmath250 .",
    "critical exponents characterize other quantities of interest .",

    "@xmath253 hence in the vicinity of @xmath232 , @xmath41 can be written @xcite @xmath254s + \\mathcal{o}(p - p_c )          \\label{def - p}\\ ] ] if one introduces the parametrization @xmath255 with @xmath256 at @xmath257 and goes over to the continuum limit with ( [ def - p ] ) it comes @xmath258 which consistently tends to zero when @xmath259 at @xmath205 .",
    "since percolation systems show a continuous transition at @xmath205 one expects that the correlation length @xmath225 defined in ( [ def - xi ] ) shows a singular behaviour at the threshold where an infinitely large cluster merges .",
    "this is indeed the case @xmath260 and the positive exponent @xmath154 can be determined numerically .",
    "percolation clusters are generally fractal objects .",
    "the radius of gyration @xmath221 is related to the volume @xmath220 through @xmath261 where @xmath262 is an effective , not necessarily integer space dimension . from the expression ( [ xi2b ] ) it follows that @xmath263 behaves like @xmath264 . the same type of derivation as the one used for the moments @xmath265 leads to a power law expression of @xmath263 whose numerator diverges with an exponent @xmath266 .",
    "hence @xmath263 itself diverges like @xmath267 and an identification with ( [ def - nu ] ) leads to @xmath268 at @xmath269 , hence the size of the largest cluster increases like @xmath270 . if @xmath41 is the strength of the infinite cluster as defined above , @xmath271 is the volume occupied by the largest cluster . if the linear extension of this cluster is of the order of the correlation length @xmath225 @xmath272 recalling the behaviour of @xmath41 in the neighbourhood of @xmath232 one gets @xmath273 in summary , general considerations lead to six critical exponents @xmath274 which are linked by four relations ( [ def - gam ] ) , ( [ def - bet ] ) , ( [ sig - nu ] ) and ( [ df - bet ] ) .    up to now",
    "we considered essentially the properties of infinite systems and concentrated on their behaviour in the vicinity of the percolation threshold which allows to determine critical exponents .",
    "these exponents are very useful quantities since they fix the universality class to which a critical system belongs .",
    "if excited nuclei are the finite counterparts of critical nuclear matter , the singular behaviour of observables at the phase transition is quantitatively characterized by critical exponents .",
    "we shall try to see and to understand below if , how and why percolation concepts could be related to nuclear fragmentation .",
    "but nuclei are finite systems .",
    "before we present and discuss the models which have been proposed , we present a study of the effects generated by the finiteness of percolation systems .",
    "percolation deals with the critical behaviour of systems in the limit of infinitely extended space .",
    "microscopic and mesoscopic systems like nuclei , atoms , molecules , aggregates are finite . as far as percolation concepts can be applied to their description and",
    "directly compared to experiment as we shall do below , it is necessary to get some insight into the behaviour of percolation models in finite space .",
    "finite size effects enter because of the presence of a surface which induces constraints on the system , especially when the space occupation is large .",
    "we concentrate here on site percolation .",
    "the aim of the study concerns the determination of the fragment size distribution of a system with @xmath61 sites , with an occupation number equal to 0 or 1 for each site .",
    "the number of occupied sites @xmath3 is fixed , the density is @xmath275 .",
    "following percolation concepts one qualitatively expects a set of small clusters when @xmath42 is small , hence a cluster size distribution which decays monotonously as a function of the cluster size and for large values of @xmath42 one or several large clusters together with small clusters showing a kind of @xmath276-shape . for intermediate values of @xmath42 small and intermediate size clusters may coexist .",
    "these shapes are in fact observed in the experiment .",
    "the crucial point concerns the behaviour of the distribution for these intermediate values of @xmath42 .",
    "the behaviour of finite percolation systems has been investigated in @xcite .",
    "one considers a finite volume @xmath61 in a @xmath137-dimensional space .",
    "space occupation by @xmath3 particles is defined by @xmath277 where @xmath278 label @xmath3 occupied sites .",
    "there are @xmath279 possible arrangements .",
    "to each occupation can be attributed a canonical weight , @xmath280 $ ] where @xmath182 is the hamiltonian of the system and @xmath149 can be interpreted as an inverse temperature .",
    "define @xmath281 a simple choice would be @xmath282 where @xmath283 is a positive constant and @xmath284 taking values 0 and 1 defines a link structure which decides whether two sites are connected or not .",
    "the link structure introduces the concept of clusters as sets @xmath285 of connected occupied sites @xmath286 , with size @xmath287 and a surface ( called perimeter in section 4.1 ) made of those unoccupied sites which are the nearest neighbours of occupied ones .    given a cluster of size @xmath288 and surface @xmath220 ,",
    "we call @xmath289 the free complement of @xmath285 which is such that @xmath290 the central observable is the average multiplicity of clusters of a given size in the canonical ensemble , allowing for all possible occupations with fixed @xmath288 , weighted by the boltzmann factor @xmath291 .    the average of an observable @xmath165 is defined by @xmath292 \\",

    "this is due to the fact that the interaction is restricted to nearest neighbour occupied sites .",
    "the probability to find a cluster @xmath285 of size @xmath288 in a configuration is given by @xmath295 then @xmath296 for any observable @xmath165 .",

    "this is true both in the case when the coupling constant @xmath283 is zero or finite except that the transition from the falling distribution for small @xmath42 to the @xmath276-shape is located at different values of @xmath42 for different values of @xmath283 .",
    "hence in order to study the consequences of the constraint imposed by ( [ mass ] ) one may restrict this study to the case @xmath300 which allows for the use of simple analytical arguments .",
    "then @xmath301 where s is the surface defined above and @xmath302 the number of clusters of size @xmath288 and surface @xmath220 .    in the case where the system is dilute @xmath303 @xmath304 the degeneracy @xmath305 is a complicated function of the link structure @xmath306 .",
    "there exists some knowledge about it @xcite .",
    "in fact @xmath302 differs from zero only in a narrow range of surfaces .",
    "it is convenient to introduce @xmath307 where @xmath308 is the distribution of surface sizes for fixed @xmath288 .",

    "then @xmath332 in fact @xmath44 is determined by the crossing of the two topological limits fixed by the small and large cluster sector .",
    "hence in finite systems the onset of a `` critical '' regime is correlated with a topological constraint which , in a finite but large volume , corresponds to cluster surfaces with a maximum in the vicinity of @xmath333 .    in the case of large @xmath42",
    "it is sensible to parametrize the surface following ( [ sigma ] ) above . then @xmath334 with @xmath335 this distribution is monotonically rising with @xmath288 if @xmath336 and reaches a maximum at @xmath337 . in all other cases it peaks at @xmath338 . for @xmath339",
    "is of course zero .    in summary ,",
    "simple considerations lead to a different behaviour of cluster size distributions in different density sectors of finite systems .",
    "this behaviour is essentially governed by the mass conservation constraint ( [ mass ] ) imposed by the finite volume in which the system is located . for small densities",

    "as we shall show below they are in qualitative agreement with explicit simulation results and experimentally observed cluster size distributions .",
    "the first applications of percolation concepts to the description of nuclear fragmentation were proposed by bauer and collaborators @xcite , campi and desbois @xcite .",

    "the intriguing and impressive success of classical percolation models in the description of finite nuclear fragmentation events and the existence of a continuous phase transition in infinite percolation systems triggered many attempts to compare and possibly relate different models with the percolation approach .",

    "close similarities between mmmc and percolation models were found , in particular the `` critical '' zone which was discussed in section 4.6 .",
    "the main qualitative difference between the two approaches is the manifestation of the presence of fission events ( two heavy fragments ) which are absent in the percolation simulations .",
    "this was interpreted as being due to the presence of the long range coulomb interaction which is not taken into account by the percolation model .",
    "three - body correlations between the three heaviest fragments were also in agreement with the percolation predictions .",
    "so called cracking events with more than two large fragments emphasized the role and importance of the coulomb interaction .",
    "moment correlations @xcite have been used in order to test different models and possibly discriminate between them @xcite .",

    "it raises the up to now unanswered question why this is so .",
    "it shows that a minimum information model is sufficient in order to explain the a priori complex nuclear fragmentation process .",

    "the influence of the coulomb interaction will be more extensively discussed in the framework of lattice models in section 5 . taking a pessimistic attitude , it is tempting to conclude that the success of percolation concepts is the sign that the information content of the process is poor .",
    "but there remains the fact that the result is not trivial since the model is not .",
    "the success of a percolation description raises the problem of the presence of a phase transition in the infinite nuclear system , its origin and its nature .",

    "this information has to be reproduced .",
    "it has to be related to the properties of observables related to the energy , in particular to the thermodynamic properties of the system if it is in equilibrium .",

    "even though the information on criticality extracted this way looks reasonable it remains suspicious to use it in order to conclude about the determination of the universality class of the phase transition which is the ultimate goal of such an analysis . on the other hand , it is difficult to believe that the use of scaling assumptions implemented by means of fss can be used in practice in the framework of the analysis of experimental events since , among other severe problems , the number of points necessary to construct scaling functions would be rather restricted because of the small interval of sizes which can be reached with nuclei .",
    "critical exponents are rather refined quantities .",
    "there remains hope to be able to detect the existence and eventually the order of phase transitions in nuclear matter by other means .",
    "considering thermodynamic aspects of fragmentation , this can possibly be reached restricting ones considerations to finite systems .",
    "the question concerning the order of a phase transition has been raised recently on theoretical grounds @xcite in the framework of the lee and yang theory @xcite and the approach of grossmann and collaborators @xcite .",
    "the criterion which allows to distinguish between different orders concerns the location of the zeroes of the grand canonical and the canonical partition function in the complex temperature plane .",
    "but these considerations are theoretical , possibly difficult to implement in practice for interacting systems and the connection with experiment is lacking . in section 6",
    "we shall show that there may exist simple operational means to overcome the problem .",
    "finite size effects can hide or even delude the truth with respect to the order of a phase transition .",
    "different ensembles may lead to a different behaviour of observables when applied to finite systems .",
    "we shall indeed see below that characteristic features of observables when calculated in the framework of a specific ensemble may be of some help in order to decide about the nature of the transition .",
    "the assertion has however again to be taken with a grain of salt since there does not exist any guarantee that these characteristic features will maintain their validity in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we present and discuss here different lattice models which have been introduced and studied by different groups .",
    "the essential point of interest concerns the existence of signs for the existence of one or several phase transition(s ) in nuclear matter .",
    "the success of percolation raised the question for the reasons of its achievements . as we saw in section 4 , classical lattice systems described by the ising ,",
    "ashkin - teller and potts models are generally close to percolation models @xcite .",
    "they describe hamiltonian systems , hence they introduce an explicit , physical description of an @xmath140-body system . this was the main motivation for the introduction of the ising model in order to interpret the cluster size distributions of an excited , fragmented system @xcite .    in order to be able to get a clearer understanding of the behaviour of observables the model",

    "the perimeter of a cluster is the ensemble of nearest neighbour sites whose spin takes the value which is opposite to the spins in the cluster . with this definition and after a mapping of the classical system into a quantum system of independent fermions @xcite it is convenient to introduce projection operators along lines @xmath529 and columns@xmath530 @xmath531 and @xmath532 where @xmath533 is the standard pauli matrix .",

    "the use of the ising model presents a further weakness which stems from the fact that the identification of clusters in terms of spins which are aligned in a given direction breaks the @xmath555 symmetry which is present by construction and leads to non conservation of the number of `` particles '' .",

    "the identification of clusters raises the question of their definition .",

    "the most disturbing one concerns the fact that the thermodynamic critical point does not coincide with the percolation critical point at which the cluster size distribution shows a power law behaviour if clusters are defined as an ensemble of particles occupying connex ( nearest neighbour ) sites @xcite .",
    "if clusters are defined in a purely geometric way as made of connected occupied sites percolation events generate a whole line of points in the phase diagram , an infinite cluster is obtained in the infinite limit on the right hand side of the dot - dashed line shown in fig .",
    "[ fig16 ] .",
    "this is of course unphysical , since at high temperature one expects essentially small clusters and isolated particles .",

    "one may notice also that contrary to the case of multifragmentation models @xcite in which clusters are by construction spherical the cluster along the kerstz line have surfaces with fractal properties which allows for a freeze - out density larger than the `` critical '' density .",
    "furthermore one observes that the excitation energy per particle above the ground state keeps approximately constant along the critical line @xcite .",
    "further work relying on lattice models in the framework of nuclear fragmentation was developed in the recent past .",
    "it concerns the study of the two types of phase transitions ( thermodynamic and percolation ) mentioned above which may be of different orders ( first and second ) , the importance of the coulomb interaction , problems related to the finite nature of the systems .",
    "we examine different approaches and their contribution to the understanding and explanation of these questions in the next subsections .",
    "the generic character of lattice gas models ( lgm ) , their kinship with percolation models and classical systems of particles with short range interactions lead to a large amount of theoretical investigations .",
    "das gupta and jicai pan proposed different variants of this type of models @xcite and applied them for direct comparison with experimental data @xcite .",
    "they worked out the canonical partition function @xmath139 on the lattice in an analytic form by using the bragg - williams approximation for the calculation of the potential contribution to the free energy . in this approximation",
    "the number of sites which are occupied in the neighbourhood of a fixed ocupied site is fixed in the average as @xmath574 , where @xmath446 is the number of neighbours ( coordinance ) and @xmath575 the average number of occupied sites ( @xmath169 ) in a lattice with @xmath140 sites .",

    "an interaction @xmath576 between blocks is taken into account and fixed along with the chemical potential of the particles by means of a self - consistent procedure .",
    "this further improvement brings in fact rather small changes when compared with the bragg - williams approximation and is rather close to the outcome of a mean field approach using a realistic skyrme interaction . in all cases",
    "the descriptions show signs for the existence of a first order phase transition for all values of @xmath42 , a second order transition at @xmath577 where @xmath563 is the normal nuclear matter density .",

    "the freeze - out density determined in this way came out to be @xmath580 .",
    "one very important point in nuclear fragmentation concerns the role and importance of the coulomb interaction .",
    "this point has been emphasized in the framework of multifragmentation models @xcite . a calculation in the framework of an lgm for a large system obtained through the collision of @xmath101 on @xmath101 shows that the coulomb interaction may have a sizable effect and may lead to large discrepancies between lgm and the experiment @xcite .",
    "one may introduce two types of binding energies between nearest neighbours which correspond to the interaction between identical and different types of particles ( protons and neutrons ) @xcite .",
    "this has been done by means of monte carlo simulations and the results were compared to the outcome of molecular dynamics ( md ) calculations which coincide with the lattice gas results in the absence of the coulomb interaction .",
    "it is no longer the case when this interaction is taken into account .",
    "the lgm results deviate from the md results in large systems with a sizable amount of protons .",

    "further comparisons with different models have been performed @xcite such as percolation and multifragmentation models .",

    "the multifragmentation approach possesses quantum mechanical properties and @xmath488 increases linearly with @xmath10 while in the lgm @xmath488 stays at the constant value @xmath581 .",
    "it should be mentioned that the algorithm used in the simulations @xcite does not sample the events in a rigorous fashion @xcite .",
    "this should however not qualitatively affect the results and change the conclusions .",
    "lattice gas models were further developed and analysed in the framework of the canonical ensemble by gulminelli and chomaz @xcite , borg , mishustin and bondorf @xcite and carmona , richert and tarancn @xcite .",
    "gulminelli and chomaz @xcite constructed the phase diagram of a finite system by working out the compressibility coefficient .",
    "this quantity shows an anomalous behaviour , it becomes negative at some temperature @xmath10 over some density interval , the sign for the existence of a first order phase transition in the infinite system .",
    "[ fig17 ] shows the behaviour of the chemical potential represented as a function of pressure exemplifies this phenomenon .",
    "it has also been observed that the fragment size distribution possesses a separation line ( kertsz line ) which crosses the phase separation line and enters the coexistence zone at some low value of the density .",
    "this is a priori somewhat surprising since it means that in the thermodynamic limit one would observe the existence of a second order transition in the coexistence zone .",
    "however , it is found out that for large systems the separation line stops effectively at the thermodynamic critical point located at @xmath582 , hence the authors interpret the effect as a typical finite size effect .",
    "they comfort this point of view by showing that in this region of the phase diagram the fragment size distribution does not go through a power law distribution when one crosses the separation line in the coexistence zone .",
    "if this is so , it means that the system never shows the signs for a critical behaviour for subcritical densities .",
    "lattice gas models were also recently extended to the case where two types of particles , protons ( @xmath106 ) and neutrons ( @xmath169 ) coexist . the refinement is implemented by the choice of different nearest neighbour interaction strngths , @xmath583 .",
    "these constant quantities were chosen such as to reproduce the nuclear binding energies of the corresponding quantum systems .",
    "one may ask for the consequences of the introduction of the isospin degree of freedom @xcite .",
    "in fact , the extension of the model has only a small effect on the phase diagram , so that in practice there exists only one relevant order parameter , @xmath584 , where @xmath585 and @xmath586 are the liquid and gas density respectively .",
    "critical exponents do not depend on the isospin degree of freedom either , and the critical temperature shows a quadratic dependence on asymmetry .",
    "the sign for isospin effects may perhaps be found in the fact that in the coexistence region the vapour mode of small fragments is more isospin asymmetric than the liquid mode of larger fragments .",
    "this can in fact be observed in the experiment @xcite .",
    "a similar model with protons and neutrons has been studied in ref .",
    "the thermodynamic properties of the system are determined for open boundary conditions and the caloric curve is constructed at constant density and constant pressure . for fixed pressure one",

    ", the caloric curve is monotonously increasing with energy .",
    "fragment size distributions are analysed along isobars and isochores .",
    "they show the usual trend , with increasing temperature the large fragment yield shrinks and the small fragment and light particle contribution increases continuously .",
    "recently the effect of the shape of the surface of the fragmenting system on the fragment size distribution has also been investigated @xcite .",
    "cubic shapes with and without periodic boundary conditions as well as spherical shapes with sharp and diffuse surfaces have been considered .",
    "these shapes have no real influence on the thermodynamic properties and fragment size distributions of small systems with typically @xmath587 particles at the critical density .",
    "similar tests have been performed on other models , see below @xcite .",
    "it raises the question wether the shape dependence of fragmentation events may be detected in experimental data .",
    "as already mentioned the success of percolation concepts for the reproduction of experimental fragment size distributions raised the question of the correlations between theses quantities and the actual dynamics of highly excited nuclei @xcite .",
    "peripheral collisions @xcite indicate that the spectator remnant behaves essentially as an excited system of particles which is thermalized .",
    "it leads to the idea that fragmenting nuclei can essentially be described as completely disordered systems of interacting particles , at least under the experimental conditions described above .",
    "furthermore , it is a non trivial but established fact that disorder may be connected with complexity and universality @xcite .",
    "this property reflects the fact that disordered systems are not sensitive to the details of their dynamical characteristics but show features which are common to many of them such as the scaling properties discussed above .    in the present section we introduce and discuss",
    "so called cellular models which are aimed to relate the phase space properties of a classical system of particles to bond probabilities and hence to the generation of bound clusters .",
    "they can be considered as extensions of lattice models .",

    "the violation of the inequality relating relative distances and momenta defined above leads to the rejection of the corresponding event .",
    "three different procedures have been introduced in order to identify bound clusters . in",

    "this procedure is close to a percolation algorithm but @xmath608 is not chosen in a uniform distribution .",
    "it neglects also the correlations which exist between pairs sharing common particles .",
    "the second procedure ( a1 ) fixes the energy of a pair @xmath610 of neighbouring particles @xmath50 and @xmath86 by means of their phase space coordinates which are fixed as described above .",
    "this fixes also @xmath608 and the bond criterion is the same as for a2 . finally , correlations are fully taken into account by means of algorithm a0 for which the generated phase space @xmath611 is used to calculate explicitly @xmath558 for each pair .",
    "it corresponds to a deterministic determination of the clusters for each generated event .",
    "it is important to notice that none of these descriptions implies that the considered systems are necessarily in any kind of equilibrium .",
    "the fragment content can be characterized by the mass distribution , its moments and associated observables like @xmath428 which has already been defined above . in order to compare directly with the experiment these observables",

    "the deviations are indicated by the correlations which are built in a1 and absent from a2 .",
    "one expects that the effect is due to the hybrid nature of the algorithm which mixes probabilistic and deterministic properties .",
    "algorithm a0 provides a priori the most realistic description since it takes all correlations consistently into account .",
    "it allows also for an easy treatment of the long range coulomb interaction . for a fixed value of the length @xmath137 of the cubic cells the moments @xmath622 and @xmath623 can differ sensibly from the percolation results .",
    "if , however , one averages over events corresponding to values of @xmath137 which are uniformly distributed over a given interval of densities @xmath42 , say from @xmath624 to @xmath625 , one obtains mass distributions , @xmath622 and @xmath626 which are remarkably close to those obtained with a2 and robust with respect to modifications of the strength of the short range potential as it is the case with a2 .",

    "as it can be seen , the agreement between experiment and simulations is excellent .",
    "this is not really surprising since bond percolation and a2 lead to very close results and , as it has been seen in section 4 , percolation reproduces experimental results .",
    "the use of simple cubic shapes for the description of the fragmenting system may appear as too restrictive .",

    "when constraints are applied on the spin population of different spin directions at the different sites of the system the bend disappears @xcite .",
    "the importance of constraints has of course also consequences for the interpretation of experimental results which depend of the physical conditions under which data are collected .",
    "fixed volume is an illustration of the effect of constraints .",
    "as already seen above @xcite , critical phenomena are strongly correlated with large fluctuations in the thermodynamic variables .",
    "this property has been exploited recently by chomaz and gulminelli @xcite in the framework of the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "these authors have explicitly shown on a simple model how the specific heat which can be defined in terms of energy fluctuations can reach negative values .",
    "a closed system with energy @xmath180 is divided into two subsystems , 1 and 2 , with energy @xmath760 and @xmath761 , @xmath762 .",

    "allow then to determine the heat capacity of the system in the framework of the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "it is clear that if @xmath787 gets larger than @xmath788 , @xmath789 gets negative which corresponds to an `` @xmath48 '' bend in the caloric curve .",
    "the analysis requires however some care .",
    "there is a priori no justification for the distribution ( [ pgauss0 ] ) to be gaussian nor for ( [ cvsum ] ) to be strictly true in the vicinity of a critical point .",
    "the lack of concavity of the entropy is the sign for it .",
    "there are however signs that , even if ( [ cvsum ] ) is not strictly correct , the variance of the real distribution can be assimilated to the variance of a gaussian distribution if the number of particles is not too small @xcite . the correction to the heat capacity due to higher moment contributions to ( [ pgauss1 ] ) has been discussed in ref .",
    "the kinetic energy distribution is in principle experimentally accessible .",
    "the relation ( [ cvsum ] ) has been applied to lattice models of the same type as the one whose hamiltonian is used in subsection 5.2.2 @xcite .",
    "the partition function reads @xmath790 where @xmath791 is the density of states at energy @xmath130 .",
    "the volume of the system is not fixed here but fluctuates .",
    "this is described by means of the introduction of a lagrange multiplier @xmath368 which is interpreted as a quantity proportional to a pressure @xmath792 where @xmath793 .",
    "the equation of state for this model has been studied numerically in the 3-dimensional space @xmath794 .",
    "one observes a backbending effect if one represents @xmath795 as a function of the average volume @xmath796 which is interpreted here as being the consequence of mass and energy conservation constraints .",
    "an `` @xmath48 '' bend appears also in the caloric curve on the @xmath797 surface . for strictly fixed volume",
    "the caloric curve does not show any backbending .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig27 ] in which the specific heat is represented as a function of energy using ( [ cv1 ] ) . with this interpretation the puzzle concerning the order of the transition which was discussed in subsection 6.2.2 @xcite",
    "is apparently explained , the shape of the caloric curve depends on the thermodynamic variables which are considered @xcite .",
    "this message is of some importance in the framework of experimental analyses .",
    "different attempts have been made since the pioneering work already mentioned above [ aladin , indra , eos ,  ] in order to construct the caloric curve starting from experimental data .",
    "the reaction @xmath798 on @xmath799 leading to an incomplete fused system has been used in order to relate the excitation energy per particle @xmath800 of the system to a so called apparent temperature @xmath801 which is obtained from the slopes of the energy distributions of emitted light particles @xcite .",

    "@xmath801 which is not the thermodynamic temperature @xmath804 is shown to be a sensible quantity , both @xmath801 and @xmath804 show the same trend as a function of the energy .",
    "the outcome of the experience is in reasonable agreement with calculations performed in the framework of the mmmc model . since this model indicates the existence of a phase transition , it is tempting to conclude that it is also experimentally true since model calculations and experimental data have been worked out under the same physical conditions .",
    "it should nevertheless be mentioned that the results do not constitute a full proof because there remain some differences between the calculations and the data analysis .",
    "former data from the texas a & m - group @xcite are in agreement with those discussed here .",
    "the problem concerning the determination of the temperature has also been raised in the framework of a sequential decay model in which fragmentation evolves in time by means of successive binary break - ups of excited fragments @xcite in a way which is similar to the approach of ref .",
    "the analysis @xcite of different definitions of the temperature leads to different results , due to the time - dependence of the process .",
    "it comes out that the experimental caloric curve @xcite can be reproduced over a large range of excitation energies .    very recently",
    "an attempt to detect the signal of a phase transition through the determination of the specific heat has been made by the multics - miniball collaboration at the cyclotron of the michigan state university @xcite . the excited system has been generated by means of @xmath101 on @xmath101 collisions at @xmath110 .",
    "the angular distributions of fragments show isotropy which is a sign for possible equilibration @xcite .",
    "the conditions are such that the number of involved particles and the total energy are fixed , so that the arguments which characterize microcanonical ensembles can be applied .",
    "the correlation between the excitation energy @xmath367 and the temperature is fixed through the balance in energy at the freeze out @xmath805 where @xmath413 is the initial mass excess , @xmath806 the mass excesses of the fragments , @xmath367 the excitation energy of the source , @xmath807 the internal excitation energy of fragment @xmath50 , @xmath808 the coulomb repulsion energy , @xmath494 the multiplicity and @xmath10 the temperature which is fixed by the balance equation .",
    "no collective energy is taken into account .",
    "a backtracing procedure is used in order to correlate the asymptotically observed events to the freeze - out configurations .",
    "the comparison of @xmath809 with smm predictions are in good though not perfect agreement .",
    "the heat capacity shows a sizable enhancement for temperatures lying between 4 and @xmath810 .    in a further step",
    "the experiment has been analysed following the microcanonical prescriptions of chomaz and gulminelli , see subsection 6.2.3 @xcite .",
    "the total energy @xmath180 has been decomposed into a kinetic and a potential contribution @xmath811 and @xmath808 is the coulomb energy acting between the fragments at freeze - out .",
    "this energy has been evaluated by means of simulations in which primary fragments are randomly distributed in a freeze - out volume equal to three times the normal volume .",
    "two extreme hypotheses have been used . either ( 1 ) all charged species including all light particles were considered as primary or ( 2 ) the totality of neutrons and light particles was distributed over the final fragments .",
    "these choices correspond to the procedures used in the framework of the smm and mmmc models . in this way ,",
    "one fixes the ensemble averaged quantities over sets of events @xmath812 and @xmath813 where @xmath814 and @xmath815 is the level density of fragments @xmath50 .",
    "the results corresponding to cases ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig28 ] . in both cases",
    "one observes the signs for a divergent behaviour of the heat capacity at two values of the energy and the expected negative contributions to the specific heat in the microcanonical framework .",
    "the stability of this result with respect to variations in the size of excitation energy bins , the assumptions on @xmath816 and the choice of the @xmath815 s have been checked .",
    "the same type of analysis has been performed with the indra detector on the outcome of the reaction @xmath189 on @xmath125 at 32 and @xmath126 central collisions @xcite . in order to extract the kinetic energy fluctuations which enter the determination of the specific heat",
    ", it has been necessary to substract the collective effects which are present and to take care of the particle emission which takes place during the expansion phase of the process .",
    "one of the two divergences which develop in the heat capacity is observed as well as the onset of negative values for this quantity .",
    "the second singularity is not seen because the excitation range does not cover the whole interval of energy corresponding to the coexistence of the phases .",
    "in the present report we tried to summarize the present knowledge about the properties of excited nuclear matter which can be gained through the confrontation of simple classical models describing finite systems and experimental facts obtained from energetic collisions between finite nuclei .    as an introduction we developed in section 2 some historical facts concerning the beginning of the activities in the field of nuclear fragmentation , both on the side of the experiment with the observation of power laws in the fragment size distributions , the introduction of the droplet model and the theoretical developments based on mean field approaches to nuclear matter and microscopic transport descriptions in the mean field approximation and beyond .",
    "we recalled that there are two main difficulties in the interpretation of experimental data obtained by means of energetic nuclear collisions .",
    "the first concerns the finite size of nuclei and the second the fact that the colliding objects evolve with time , from an initial compact system to an expanded system at the nuclear freeze - out where the nuclear interaction between fragments does no longer act , and finally to the asymptotic stage where the remnants of the reaction are identified by detectors .",
    "the second point leads to the question of the setting up of chemical and thermodynamic equilibrium . at lower energies",
    "there are signs which show that nuclear systems are able to absorb and spread sizable amounts of energy more or less uniformely over phase space .",
    "thermodynamic equilibration is discussed in section 3 in which some of the efforts which have been made in order to get information about this point are developed . for the moment",
    ", equilibration seems to be a sensible concept since experimental results can be consistently interpreted in this framework , even though no strong and clear - cut proof for it exists up tp now .",
    "one of the first and more spectacular successes in the field concerns the multiplicities of fragments of different sizes which are amazingly well reproduced by means of simple minded percolation models .",
    "this point is presented and discussed at length in section 4 .",
    "universality properties are clearly identified and the intriguing power law behaviour which was observed and was of central interest in the early days appears again in a new context . since percolation concepts are minimal information concepts it may appear that there is not much information to be gained from observables like fragment size distributions .",
    "the reasons for this may be related to the fact that highly excited nuclei behave like disordered systems , and as it is the case for many other systems of this type in other fields of physics , the details of their dynamical properties are of very restricted importance .",
    "universality properties of physical systems are remarkable because they work as a link between objects and phenomena which are seemingly very different from each other and at the same time are insensitive to the detailed information about the system .",
    "the success of percolation drew the attention towards other simple classical models which have a strong kinship with percolation but are defined in terms of hamiltonians .",
    "some of them , so called lattice and cellular models , are described and analysed in section 5 . their simplicity and at the same time their universal character leads to the observation that they work as good tools for the investigation of the properties of fragmenting nuclei .",
    "most of them are able to reproduce the properties related to fragment multiplicities .",
    "they show very useful for the investigations of effects related to finiteness in search for and analysis of phase transitions .",
    "they predict the possible existence of two types of transitions which are not necessarily correlated in an evident way , a thermodynamic transition and a continuous percolation type transition which for systems with a density between nuclear density and half nuclear density occurs at temperatures which are higher than those which correspond to the thermodynamic transition .",
    "this point is not yet clearly understood , although it does not lead , a priori , to any contradiction .",
    "it opens up the old question concerning the link with fisher s droplet model .",
    "numerical simulations on different models lead to very similar thermodynamic properties .    the final part , section 6 , deals more specifically with the problem of the existence and characterization of phase transitions and signs which show their existence in finite systems . for such types of analyses",
    "specific tools are needed .",
    "some of them have been proposed very recently , at a time where similar considerations are developed in other fields of physics dealing with small systems . some of these tools are explicitly described .",
    "theoretical methods relying on a microcanonical description and aimed to detect transitions which have been developed in the framework of lattice models have been presented .",
    "their application in the analysis of experimental data is described at the end of the section .",
    "a great wealth of information has been accumulated about the characteristics and behaviour of highly excited nuclei , their fragmentation properties and the existence of a genuine phase transition of a type which may be similar to the classical liquid - gas transition .",
    "the last point remains however to be confirmed .",
    "many pieces of the puzzle have been brought together , however the whole picture is not yet totally clear .",
    "experimental confirmation of the transition has to be brought , scaling properties further investigated , the question of the possible coexistence of two types of transitions elucidated .",
    "quantum mechanical aspects which have been quoted and the importance of quantum effects have to be further worked out and analysed .",
    "last , there remains the difficult problem of the possible off - equilibrium character of the fragmentation process of a finite critical system .",
    "the study of critical off - equilibrium dynamics is a relatively recent field of research , still in its infancy .",
    "it is a field to which the nuclear physics community interested in the behaviour of highly excited and decaying systems of particles could certainly bring its contribution .",
    "the present report would not have been written without informative and clarifying discussions with many colleagues who provided advice and insight .",
