    "fresh horizons have now opened up through the vision of mesoscopic transport as quantum - coherent transmission .",
    "this important innovation is credited to landauer s foresight @xcite , and has been deepened and extended since then by beenakker , bttiker , imry , and many others @xcite .",
    "its achievements have been impressive .    as well as their novel emphasis on coherent scattering ,",
    "the modern theories of conduction advocate a second major shift , one that is logically independent of the mechanism for transport ( quantum - coherent or otherwise ) .",
    "this is claimed to solve the subtle problems of _ open boundary conditions _",
    "@xcite , central to conduction in a real mesoscopic system @xcite .",
    "it is intended to supplant the long - dominant picture of charge flow as _",
    "drift_.    in drift , the current is the collective average response to which every carrier contributes .",
    "it is the effect of an external cause , the applied voltage . over against drift ,",
    "the new mesoscopic transport revisits the notion of charge flow as purely a kind of _",
    "diffusion_. here , it is the current that is regarded as externally supplied @xcite .",
    "introduction of current into the system sets up a virtual density imbalance between the carrier reservoirs interconnected by the transmissive device .",
    "the observed voltage drop is merely a by - product of that virtual imbalance .",
    "figure 1 illustrates the two viewpoints ; diffusion and drift are seen in their seemingly contrasting physical roles .",
    "this simple shift of perspective , from drift to diffusion , has been extraordinarily successful in predicting mesoscopic transport phenomena .",
    "these have been carefully documented and explained @xcite .",
    "the explanatory simplicity and consequent attractiveness of diffusive phenomenologies does not mean , however , that microscopically based analyses of transport and noise have become redundant .",
    "microscopic methods , built upon the legacy that runs from boltzmann to landau , are pursued with unabating vigor @xcite .",
    "that said , phenomenological simplicity has never been a foolproof guide to theoretical depth and correctness .",
    "the situation in mesoscopic physics is no different .",

    "diffusive and drift concepts of mesoscopic transport , compared .",

    "an applied electromotive force @xmath0 defines a mismatch between the quasi - fermi energies of degenerate electrons at the source and drain . only `` right movers '' at the higher - energy source lead contribute to current flow ; only `` left movers '' at the lower - energy drain lead contribute to the current counterflow .",
    "the physical current is phenomenologically identified with their difference .",
    "this pseudodiffusive current `` generates ''",

    "all of the carriers that fill states in the fermi sea feel , and respond to , the external driving force @xmath1 .",
    "each gains average momentum @xmath2 by accelerating ballistically during a mean time @xmath3 before rescattering .",
    "the flux of carriers in deeper - lying filled states is canceled by opposing filled states . only those electron states _ kinematically matched _ to holes , within a shell of thickness @xmath4 at the fermi surface , contribute to the physical ( drift ) current . _",

    "2    for a mesoscopic theory s credibility , only two questions count :    * does the theory fully respect _ all _ of the essential physics of the interacting electron gas @xcite ? * if not , _",
    "why _ not ? ( some discussion of this is in references . )",
    "our goal is straightforward .",
    "we restate , and elaborate , a plain theoretical fact . if a noise model is truly microscopic ",
    "faithful to the long - established and completely orthodox procedures of kinetics and electron - gas theory @xcite  then it must , and does , produce reliable predictions at mesoscopic scales",
    ". these may be quite surprising .",
    "microscopically based descriptions , for instance kinetic ones , outstrip the scope of low - field phenomenologies to access the strongly nonequilibrium regime . equally important is the fact that only a reliable microscopic foundation can support the well controlled approximations that are always needed to turn a generic theory into a powerful , practical design tool for novel electronics .",
    "the heart of any kinetic approach is conservation .",
    "microscopic conservation implies that diffusion and drift manifest as complementary but _ interlocking _ effects in the physics .",
    "they are in no sense mutually exclusive .",
    "this crucial point needs a closer look .      before setting out the plan of our paper",
    ", we briefly address the folklore that transmissive - diffusive models are more `` physical '' than ( and somehow superior to ) wholly kinetic descriptions of mesoscopic transport . for _ uniform _ systems , there is a formal congruence between `` pure '' drift and `` pure '' diffusion .",
    "they connect via the einstein relation @xcite which links @xmath5 , the low - field conductivity of a metal , to @xmath6 , its equilibrium diffusion constant :    @xmath7    at carrier density @xmath8 and chemical potential @xmath9 .",
    "substitution of diffusion for ( weak - field ) conductance is justified when the system s shortest scattering mean free path is much less than its length .",
    "however , it is claimed that this clearly semiclassical ansatz can be extended even to quantum - coherent mesoscopics @xcite .",
    "the conductivity quantifies the coarse - grained _ single - particle _ current response ; @xmath5 is accessible through the current - voltage characteristic .",
    "the diffusion constant is a fine - grained _ two - body _ response , and its structure",
    "is intimately tied to current fluctuations ; @xmath6 too is observable , for example via time - of - flight methods that are essentially two - point correlation measurements @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ eq_0 ] ) clearly shows that diffusion and drift go hand - in - hand ; it is not an either - or situation .",
    "einstein s relation between conductivity and diffusion brings to the fore a central theme , namely the _ underlying unity of transport and fluctuations _ ( noise ) .",
    "this unity , which is fundamentally microscopic , is embodied in the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( the einstein relation is a special case ) .",
    "it establishes the proportionality of dissipative transport to the fluctuations inherent in the structure .",
    "such a theorem can never be proved heuristically @xcite .",
    "this is the crucial point .",
    "diffusive phenomenologies are forced to invoke the fluctuation - dissipation theorem as an external assumption .",
    "it is their _ only means _ to justify , in an intuitive way , the linear current - voltage characteristic on which they absolutely rely .",
    "a transport model that chooses to favor diffusion , merely for intuitive reasons , denies the core _ microscopic unity _ of noise and conductance .",
    "the fluctuation - dissipation relation is then no longer a prescriptive , first - principles constraint on the possible physics of the problem .",
    "instead it is reduced to a highly compliant , imaginative guiding `` rule '' ; one that can be molded to any set of favorite preconceptions . for noise ,",
    "diffusive ( or , more accurately , pseudodiffusive ) descriptions invariably take this linear theorem on faith .",
    "this is so that the current - current correlator can be adjusted , by hand , to force it to fit the conductance .",
    "such maneuvers are necessary only because , quite unlike microscopic theories ( the kubo formalism @xcite is a good example ) , diffusive phenomenologies can not express  and thus compute  their correlators from first principles .",
    "the transmissive - diffusive models lack a formal basis for deriving the fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xcite .",
    "that result is provable only within a microscopic description , embedded in _ statistical mechanics _",
    "@xcite , or else in _ kinetic theory _",
    "models of the landauer - bttiker - imry class share little , if any , of that essential machinery .",
    "few mesoscopic systems are truly homogeneous on the length scale over which transport unfolds . generally , the mode of electron transfer through a nonuniform channel is not by real - space diffusion alone , or by drift alone ( that is : diffusion in velocity space ) .",
    "actual mesoscopic transport is some combination of drift and diffusion , physically conditioned by the nonuniformities specific to the system .",
    "for instance , the electron gas in a iii - v heterojunction quantum well @xcite is extremely nonuniform in the direction of crystal growth , normal to the plane of conduction .",
    "( this also leads to strong quantum confinement and to marked suppression of the fluctuations for the two - dimensional carriers @xcite . ) to insist that one transport mode is absolutely dominant is to risk distorting the real physics .",
    "only a description that treats diffusion and drift on an equal footing , favoring neither one process nor the other _ ad hoc _ , is able to span in a unified fashion the complete range of transport and noise physics .",
    "orthodox kinetic theory @xcite , coupled with precise microscopic knowledge of the electron gas @xcite , provides exactly that description .",
    "it accommodates both _ nonuniform - field effects _ and _ nonequilibrium response_.    finally we recall that weak - field approaches of the transmissive - diffusive kind tend to assume that the metallic electron gas is well described as a group of free , noninteracting fermions subject only to elastic scattering @xcite .",
    "it means that self - consistent collective screening ",
    "ever preeminent in the electron gas  is regarded as a secondary perturbation ( if , in fact , it is believed to matter at all ) .",
    "such theories are not set up to describe strongly nonuniform coulomb correlations @xcite , any more than they can treat the strongly nonequilibrium domain where dissipative _ inelastic _",
    "collisions rule explicitly @xcite .      to venture into the important regimes of high - field transport and coulomb correlations , much more",
    "is demanded of a mesoscopic theory than is deliverable by current descriptions @xcite . among the sea of literature ,",
    "it is still unusual to find theories of metallic conduction that explicitly adopt clear and firmly validated microscopic methods . at and beyond the low - field limit",
    ", a small but growing number of kinetic approaches exists @xcite , designed to answer the often - stated need @xcite for new mesoscopic approaches , especially away from equilibrium .    for novel technologies , if not for the sake of fundamental physics alone , closure of this knowledge gap is a significant task .",
    "our own endeavors are detailed in refs . .",
    "the present work is an up - to - date survey of that research .    in section 2",
    "we briefly introduce the two primary results of our exactly conserving kinetics : ( i ) _ thermal scaling _ and ( ii ) _ coulomb - induced suppression _ of nonequilibrium fluctuations in a mesoscopic metallic conductor .",
    "we discuss their physical meaning , and their place in a coherent understanding of mesoscopic noise .",
    "while these core concepts are easy to state , their formal basis requires elaboration .",
    "this is given in sec .",

    "4 we turn to a significant application : nonequilibrium ballistic fluctuations in one dimension .",
    "our strictly conservative kinetic model leads to some surprises .",
    "we state our conclusions in sec .",
    "in this section we discuss two elementary , and indispensable , boundary constraints on an externally driven open conductor .",
    "they are @xcite :    * _ global charge neutrality _ over the conductor , its interfaces , and the connected source and drain reservoirs .",

    "_ global charge neutrality ; that is , a neutrality that is absolutely independent of the dynamics within the active body of the device . *",

    "we expand on them .",

    "local charge clouds ( shaded ) are induced by the active influx and efflux of @xmath10 .",
    "these are regions of vigorous and dynamic competition among the current - driven excitation of carriers , their elastic _ and inelastic _ dissipative relaxation , and strong coulomb screening from the stabilizing lead reservoirs .",
    "together , these competing effects establish the self - consistent dipole potential @xmath11 across distance @xmath12 between drain and source ; that potential is the electromotive force in the driven system .    2      in either of the two scenarios ( fixed current or fixed emf )",

    "entry and exit of the current in a mesoscopic conductor can not be treated by vague appeals to asymptotic equilibrium @xcite .",
    "that is because entry and exit of the current is always a dynamic nonequilibrium process .",
    "to guarantee global gauge invariance , all sources and sinks _ must be considered explicitly _ as part of the dynamical description of the transport @xcite .",
    "if not , the price is clear .",
    "it is the loss of charge conservation , and an ill - conceived model .    under all circumstances , the current sources and sinks , and the emf , are _ localized _ inside a finite volume that also encloses the conductor @xcite .",
    "this , like global neutrality , is a necessary consequence of gauge invariance @xcite . outside the active volume",
    ", the undisturbed electron population within each lead ( stabilized by its compensating positive background ) always remains charge - neutral and pins the local fermi level within that lead .",
    "it means that the nonequilibrium carriers in the active , and finite , conducting channel have to reconnect smoothly to the _ invariant _ local equilibrium state beyond the interfaces @xcite .",
    "the reservoir equilibria ( each one locally proper to its lead ) remain totally unaffected by the transport dynamics . none of the local density - dependent quantities within the leads , including their fluctuations , ever changes .",

    "the mean total carrier number is constant and remains fully compensated by the nonparticipating positive background , integrated over @xmath19 .    equation ( [ eq_1 ] ) makes a straightforward statement .",
    "gauss theorem implies  unconditionally  that the device remains overall neutral at any driving field .",
    "this is true if and only if the inner active region is efficiently screened from the macroscopic leads by the electron gas at the interfaces @xcite .",

    "a question arises naturally : how can this behavior be reconciled with the appearance of shot noise , a thermally insensitive effect ?",

    "nonideality in the 1d conductance is well documented in many ballistic tests of landauer s quantized formula .",
    "nonideal conductance appears even in the most refined state - of - the - art measurements , notably the recent ones by de picciotto _",
    "et al_. @xcite .",
    "it is of great interest to predict the corresponding nonideal behavior of the nonequilibrium thermal noise .",
    "our conserving kinetic theory , worked out according to the methods described in sec .",
    "3 , results in a noise spectral density that is exact for the transport model of eq . ( [ 31 ] ) . expressed as the thermal hot - electron excess noise within a given subband of carrier states in the 1d conductor , say the @xmath169th one , it is    @xmath170    2    where @xmath171 is the classical compressibility .",
    "the subscripts `` @xmath169 '' on all quantities identify the subband ; for instance ( in the case that inelastic phonon emission modifies the ideal conductance ) , we have    @xmath172 .",
    "note once again the overall @xmath47-_scaling _ of the excess noise in eq .",
    "( [ 34 ] ) .",
    "this is due to its obviously intimate link with the compressibility , entering via the factor @xmath173 .",
    "it is the necessary consequence of microscopic conservation . as we saw above ,",
    "transmissive - diffusive approaches are seriously defective in that essential regard .",
    "we make several comments on the nature of the ballistic hot - electron spectral density .    * the dependence on collision times ( the last right - hand factor in eq .",
    "( [ 34 ] ) ) is greatly enhanced over that of @xmath174 . as the 1d structure",
    "is taken beyond its low - current regime , the excess thermal noise should reflect much more strongly the onset of nonideal behavior . * the nonlinear form of @xmath175 as a function of v shows that it is not shot noise .",
    "this is not too astonishing , in view of our earlier discussion .",
    "* when inelastic effects are dominant , @xmath176 is small and makes the ratio @xmath177 small .",
    "conversely , when @xmath176 becomes artificially large ( the inelastic mean free path is made to exceed its maximum physical limit , @xmath12 ) , then @xmath177 diverges .",
    "+ this divergence indicates that noise models relying on elastic scattering _ alone _",
    ", for their current - voltage response , are thermodynamically unstable beyond the zero - field limit .",
    "there is simply no mechanism for field - excited carriers to shed excess energy .",
    "the excess then manifests as an uncontrolled broadening of their distribution , and a very large thermal noise spectrum . * in the highly degenerate regime , the noise spectrum scales as @xmath178 , where @xmath179 is the subband threshold energy . for a well",
    "filled subband , the noise is strongly suppressed . in the classical limit",
    ", @xmath180 becomes _ independent _ of temperature as @xmath181 .",
    "experiments on 1d ballistic wires or on quantum point contacts are designed so that the subband occupancies in their structures can be systematically changed via a gate - control potential @xcite .",
    "we have described the marked behavioral change in the hot - electron noise as a function of subband density @xmath182 .",
    "this suggests some intriguing possibilities for excess - noise measurements in 1d wires , particularly at higher source - drain fields .",
    "the following scenario now unfolds . when a subband is depopulated ( classical limit ;",
    "@xmath183 ) , the factor @xmath184 of @xmath185 is at its maximum value , unity . at the same time , the conductance @xmath174 is negligible , since it scales with @xmath182 which vanishes .",
    "the vanishing of @xmath174 means that there is little spectral strength in the noise .    as we cross the subband threshold ( with @xmath174 now rising from nearly zero up to @xmath186 ) , the factor @xmath184 starts to drop in magnitude .",
    "well above the threshold ( quantum limit ; @xmath187 ) , @xmath174 is a maximum , but @xmath188 .",
    "again there is little spectral strength .",
    "we see that @xmath180 must pass through a maximum close to the energy threshold @xmath189 .",
    "below it , the noise is that of a low - density gas of classical carriers .",
    "above , it is that of a highly degenerate fermi system .    our results are shown in fig . 5 for a 1d wire with two subbands .",
    "the peaks in the hot - electron noise are dramatic , somewhat unexpected , and much less likely to be resolved in two- or three - dimensional systems .",
    "the peak structures are due directly to the strong influence of electron degeneracy ( indeed , of the compressibility sum rule ) in 1d metallic systems .    in the same figure , we display the corresponding ideal - noise spectral density of transmissive - diffusive theory @xcite ( refer to eq .",
    "( [ 16 ] ) in the previous section ) .",
    "as we have shown , that approach badly violates the compressiblity sum rule and hence charge conservation . in any case , at high fields it is overshadowed by the hot - electron excess noise as computed in our conserving kinetic model . at low fields , where both kinetic and phenomenological models behave quadratically with @xmath190 , the hot - electron noise is still dominant @xcite .",
    "we also model the effect of nonideal inelastic scattering by plotting the second ( upper - subband ) noise contribution as a function of three different collision - time ratios @xmath191 ; namely , @xmath192 , and 1 .",
    "there is a pronounced loss in strength for the second peak as the inelastic effects are made stronger .",
    "the corresponding plots of conductance ( right - hand scale ) are much less affected .",
    "the sharp falloff in the excess thermal noise should therefore be a prime signature of dynamical processes that could modify ballistic transport as observed .",
    "[ f5 ]    fig .",
    "5 . excess thermal noise and conductance of a ballistic wire , calculated within a strictly conserving kinetic model . left scale : the excess noise at the high voltage @xmath193 , normalized to the ideal ballistic johnson - nyquist noise @xmath194 , is plotted as a function of chemical potential @xmath9 .",
    "right scale : the corresponding quantized two - probe conductance @xmath130 , normalized to the universal quantum @xmath195 .",
    "the large peaks in the excess noise occur at the subband crossing points of @xmath130 located at energies @xmath196 and @xmath197 .",
    "the noise is remarkably high at the crossing points , where the subband electrons are _ classical_. it is low at the plateaux in @xmath130 , where subband _ degeneracy _ suppresses thermal noise .",
    "there is a pronounced sensitivity of @xmath198 to nonideality in @xmath130 , controlled by the ratio @xmath199",

    "( [ 16 ] ) .",
    "it is much smaller than thermal hot - electron noise .    2",
    "in this presentation we have stressed one idea above all : that transport and noise are deeply intertwined .",
    "their connection is microscopic .",
    "this means that a microscopic analysis ( provided , for instance , by kinetic theory ) is the only effective vehicle for accessing the physics of mesoscopic noise and transport , in a logically seamless way .",
    "there exists a distinctive set of fundamental identities that _ must _ be satisfied within every truly microscopic model of mesoscopic conduction .",
    "the fluctuation - dissipation theorem is one such @xcite .",
    "it is essential to the understanding of noise as a phenomenon conjoint with transport .    alongside that basic theorem ,",
    "the fermi - liquid structure of the electron gas provides the remaining fundamental relations : the _ sum rules _",
    "they are as critical to mesoscopic transport as the fluctuation - dissipation relation itself .",
    "how scant the regard has been for the electron - gas sum rules within mesoscopics  despite those rules long and thoroughly documented history @xcite  can be gauged by the absence of any reference to them , even in the most authoritative accounts of contemporary mesoscopic theory @xcite .",
    "satisfaction of the sum rules is mandatory for any theory that claims to describe degenerate electrons .",
    "this applies most especially to every candidate model of mesoscopic noise .    in the area of nonequilibrium",
    "mesoscopic conduction , we have covered the physical genesis and significance of one of the primary sum rules , that for the compressibility .",
    "there are three conclusions :    * a correctly formulated kinetic theory of mesoscopic transport and fluctuations , for _ open _ metallic conductors , will satisfy the compressibility sum rule .",
    "this severely constrains the fluctuation spectrum even at high fields .",
    "we have shown that the same , invariant , sum rule is valid well beyond the near - equilibrium regime . * in an _ inhomogeneous _ metallic conductor , strong internal coulomb correlations modify the fluctuations .",
    "they , and hence the current noise , are self - consistently suppressed by the increased electrostatic energy .",
    "the additional coulomb suppression lowers the value of the equilibrium compressibility . + the suppressed compressibility persists , without any alteration , even when the degenerate system is driven out of equilibrium .",
    "we predict that the signature of this suppression will be found in reduced levels of excess hot - electron noise for certain quantum - well - confined channels @xcite . *",
    "the compressibility sum rule is _ violated _ by all mesoscopic noise models based on the paradigm of ( coherent ) transmission linked to diffusion .",
    "the latter , especially , is incompatible with the open reservoirs crucial function in controlling the magnitude of nonequilibrium noise in a degenerate mesoscopic conductor . + the overall _ temperature scaling _ of the thermal fluctuation spectrum is a necessary consequence of degeneracy , expressed through the compressibility sum rule . that scaling too is violated by every transmissive - diffusive model , without exception .",
    "sum - rule violations place a prodigious question mark over a theory s physical coherence .",
    "no amount of rationalization can undo this degree of inconsistency .    in one dimension ,",
    "our strictly conserving kinetic theory of transport and noise recovers  as it should  the quantized landauer conductance steps observed in open ( thus phase - incoherent ) contacts @xcite .",
    "it also makes possible the calculation of nonequilibrium hot - electron noise in a one - dimensional ballistic device @xcite .    as the carrier density in the device changes ,",
    "striking peaks appear in the excess thermal noise .",
    "these features contain detailed information on the dynamics of nonideal transport in the sample .",
    "they are _ unrelated to shot noise _ , which is a quite distinct form of nonequilibrium electron - hole fluctuation .",
    "numerically , they dominate the corresponding prediction of transmissive - diffusive phenomenology .",
    "elsewhere we apply our kinetic analysis of ballistic noise to the celebrated quantum - point - contact noise measurements by reznikov _",
    "our conservative kinetic computation shows that the linear dispersion of excess current noise , with emf , is far from being the unique signature of shot noise .",
    "the much - enhanced sensitivity of hot - electron noise to electron - phonon processes , as we have discussed , accounts for the observations equally well @xcite .    in the future",
    ", we will expand our set of applications to cover the fine details of low - dimensional mesoscopic conduction .",
    "as to the reznikov _",
    "_ data @xcite , a second and baffling set of observations should be examined : the anomalous sequence of strong noise peaks at the lowest subband threshold , for fixed levels of the source - drain _ current_. there , the landauer - bttiker noise theory @xcite predicts , not the strong ( and quite unexpected ) peaks that actually appear @xcite , but a totally featureless monotonic drop in the noise signal right across the lowest subband threshold .",
    "those anomalous peaks have been analyzed @xcite .",
    "they are quite thermal .",
    "they respond in a most remarkable way to field - induced , inelastic electron - phonon scattering .",
    "their resolution rests with the unexpected behavior that kinetic theory reveals for the spectrum of excited ballistic electrons .",
    "we thank jagdish thakur for agreeing to the use of data from our collaboration , for his initiative in extending our ballistic theory , and not least for many insightful discussions .",
