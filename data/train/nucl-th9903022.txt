    "in recent years the study of neutrino - nucleus reactions has attracted continuously growing interest . besides astrophysical motivations this interest has particularly been inspired by the use of neutrino - nucleus reactions as a laboratory to study fundamental properties of neutrinos . the best studied nucleus by @xmath8-induced reactions is @xmath0c , which is an ingredient of liquid scintillator and plays an important role in the oscillation search experiments performed by the karmen @xcite and lsnd @xcite collaborations .",
    "the exclusive and inclusive charged - current reactions @xmath0c(@xmath2)@xmath0n have been measured by the karmen and lsnd collaborations for neutrinos generated by muon decay at rest @xcite .",
    "the karmen collaboration has supplemented this by a measurement of the neutral current @xmath0c(@xmath9)@xmath10(15.11 mev ) cross section @xcite . using the lampf pion - decay - in - flight neutrino source , the lsnd collaboration has also measured the @xmath0c(@xmath4)@xmath0n cross section @xcite .",
    "together with the precisely known inclusive and exclusive muon - capture rates on @xmath0c @xcite , these measurements represent a challenge to the theorists .    various data on the exclusive reactions ( also including electro - magnetic transitions and beta decays ) , leading to the triad of @xmath11 analog states in the @xmath12 nuclei ( these are the @xmath0b and @xmath0n ground states and the excited state in @xmath0c at 15.11 mev ) , appear to be consistent and",
    "are theoretically well described , validating the total neutrino flux determination @xcite . however , the situation is somewhat different for the inclusive reactions ; the term is adopted here for the reactions leading to final states in @xmath0b and @xmath0n other than the ground state ( in the following denoted by @xmath0b@xmath13 and @xmath0n@xmath13 , respectively ) and involving states in the continuum .",
    "the data on inclusive weak processes ( @xmath0c(@xmath2)@xmath0n@xmath13 , @xmath0c(@xmath4)@xmath0n@xmath13 and muon capture ) are usually not simultaneously reproduced by calculations @xcite , with a notable exception @xcite .",
    "for example , a reasonable model to calculate these cross sections is the continuum random phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "in fact , one finds that this model describes the inclusive muon capture rate and the @xmath0c(@xmath2)@xmath0n@xmath13 cross section very well , but it overestimates the @xmath0c(@xmath4)@xmath0n@xmath13 data noticeably . of course",
    ", these three weak processes probe the nuclear response at different momentum ( @xmath14 ) and energy ( @xmath15 ) transfers , and thus the good description of the capture rate ( with average values @xmath16 mev , @xmath17 mev / c ) and the @xmath18-induced cross section ( @xmath19 mev , @xmath20 mev / c ) might simply indicate that the model does well for low values of @xmath14 and @xmath15 , but it is less reliable at larger momentum and energy transfers which are important for the @xmath0c(@xmath4)@xmath0n@xmath13 experiment ( @xmath21 mev , @xmath22 mev ) .",
    "such hypothesis has , however , been invalidated by the continuum rpa study of the inelastic electron scattering on @xmath0c where the model has been demonstrated to describe well the data for momentum and energy transfer regions relevant for the lsnd experiment @xcite .",
    "could the origin of the discrepancy be nuclear correlations missing in the continuum rpa model ?",
    "this is in fact what the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite suggest .",
    "first , they point out that , due to pairing effects , there are about 1.6 nucleons occupying the @xmath1 subshell in the @xmath0c ground state , rather than the closed @xmath23 configuration ( and empty @xmath1 subshell ) assumed in the previous continuum rpa calculations .",
    "second , they argue on the basis of a standard rpa calculation that this partial occupation in fact allows one to simultaneously describe all three inclusive weak processes .",
    "obviously the method of choice to test this conjecture is the interacting shell model . but a reliable calculation of the @xmath0c(@xmath4)@xmath0n@xmath13 cross section requires inclusion of at least the complete 3@xmath24 model space , which is a formidable task even on modern computers .",
    "short of such a large - scale shell model calculation , we have performed a set of continuum ( standard ) rpa calculations for the various inclusive ( and exclusive ) cross sections extending our previous model to allow for partial occupancies of the subshells .",
    "the second motivation for repeating our previous calculations within an improved model is that recently the decay - in - flight neutrino spectrum for the lsnd experiment has been revised . with the updated flux ,",
    "the experimental cross section slightly increased to @xmath7 @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "as the lsnd experiment is such an important benchmark we feel obliged to also consistently update our calculated cross section allowing for a meaningful comparison .",
    "the continuum random phase approximation for nuclei with closed - shell configurations is well documented in the literature @xcite .",
    "a generalization of this formalism to partial occupancies is readily achieved by multiplying the relevant matrix elements in eq .",
    "( 17 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite with the partial occupation numbers , @xmath25 , for the hole states , thus @xmath26 after this replacement , the numerical solution of the continuum rpa equations follow the lines as outlined in ref .",
    "the orthogonalization of the particle states on the hole states is performed by schmidt s procedure .    with the exception of the @xmath27 triad of bound states in the @xmath12 nuclei , all other final states ( which contribute to the inclusive cross section ) lie above the particle emission threshold and",
    "therefore are described as resonances within the continuum rpa model . as residual interactions we used as before the finite - range g - matrix @xcite derived from the bonn",
    "nn potential ( bp ) and , in order to estimate the theoretical uncertainties , also an empirical zero - range landau - migdal force ( lm ) .    to derive an estimate of the partial occupancies of the @xmath1 subshell",
    ", we have performed a shell model calculation for @xmath0c with the oxbash code @xcite and the cohen - kurath interaction @xcite .",
    "this calculation suggests a partial occupation for the @xmath1 subshell of 0.75 for protons and neutron , respectively .",
    "this result is rather close to the value 0.8 used in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "first we recalculated the various exclusive processes leading to the @xmath27 triad in the @xmath12 nuclei . since these states are discrete we used the standard rpa in this calculation , again including partial occupancies as outlined above .",
    "as single particle states we considered the complete @xmath28 model space . for the proton and neutron @xmath23 and @xmath1 single particle energies we used the experimental values ; the others have been determined from a woods - saxon potential which describes the @xmath0c charge distribution well @xcite . we have checked that an enlargement of the model space does not affect our results .",
    "our rpa results are compared to data in tables  1 and  2 .    in table  1",
    "the rescaling factors @xmath29 needed to bring calculation and data in agreement are shown .",
    "note , that allowing the partial occupancy of the @xmath1 subshell reduces the value of @xmath29 substantially , from about 4 to less than 2 . at the same time the rescaling factors are essentially identical for the three processes considered , showing consistency .",
    "the necessity of using such renormalization reflects again the well known fact that random phase approximation calculations do not describe all ( proton - neutron ) correlations necessary to reproduce the quenching of the gamow - teller strength @xcite .",
    "this aim can be only achieved in shell - model calculations within a complete major shell , introducing additionally the renormalization of the spin operator by the universal factor @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "deviating from this universal finding , the cohen - kurath interaction had been designed to describe the weak interaction transition rates in @xmath0c without incorporating the renormalization of the spin operator .",
    "thus the fact that @xmath31 in our calculation again shows the wellknown result that the reproduction of the gamow - teller strength requires the consideration of genuine correlations beyond a simple mean - field approach .    in table  2",
    "we compare the results on the exclusive neutrino induced reactions with data .",
    "the entries are based on @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the agreement remains good , and at the same time , as mentioned above , the required renormalization is substantially smaller than in our previous rpa calculation .",
    "the reduction is caused by the destructive interference of the @xmath23 and @xmath1 configurations in the rpa description of the gamow - teller transition , as discussed by auerbach et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we then studied the three inclusive processes within our improved continuum rpa model .",
    "the noticeable mixture of @xmath1 configuration into the @xmath0c ground state allows for the excitation of a larger number of resonances than in the previous calculation .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where the @xmath0c(@xmath4)@xmath0n@xmath13 cross section ( calculated with the bp force ) is shown as a function of the excitation energy @xmath15 of the nucleus .",
    "however , this figure also demonstrates that the strength going into these additional resonances is taken away from those transitions already present for the pure @xmath23 ground state .",
    "in fact , table  3 shows that the total inclusive rate and cross sections are only slightly reduced by the mixing of a @xmath1 component into the ground state .",
    "the inclusive muon capture rate and the @xmath0c(@xmath2)@xmath0n@xmath13 cross section agree very well with data : for muon capture the improved continuum rpa yields for both residual interactions rates close to the experimental value ( @xmath34 s@xmath35 ) , and the calculated @xmath0c(@xmath2)@xmath0n@xmath13 cross sections are also close to the most recent data @xmath36 @xmath6 @xcite and @xmath37 @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "our calculation of the inclusive @xmath0c(@xmath4)@xmath0n@xmath13 cross section results also in a reduced value compared to our previous study , where the reduction is about half ( @xmath38 @xmath6 for bp , @xmath39 @xmath6 for lm ) due to the revised flux and half ( @xmath40 @xmath6 for bp , @xmath41 @xmath6 for lm ) due to the partial occupation of the @xmath1 subshell in the ground state wave function .",
    "our new total @xmath0c(@xmath4)@xmath0n cross section ( inclusive + normalized exclusive ) is then @xmath42 @xmath6 and @xmath43 @xmath6 for the bp- and lm - force , respectively , to be compared with the last experimental value of ( @xmath44 @xmath6 ) .",
    "thus the disturbing discrepancy is less severe than before , but it not entirely removed .",
    "our result does not support in detail the argumentation in ref .",
    "@xcite that the discrepancy between rpa calculations and data can be essentially fully removed if @xmath1 partial occupancy is considered ( ref .",
    "@xcite gives @xmath45 @xmath6 ) and all inclusive and exclusive processes can be simultaneously and consistently described .",
    "we also mention that singh et al .",
    "@xcite have studied the various processes based on the local density approximation and find a total ( exclusive + inclusive ) muon capture rate of @xmath46 s@xmath35 @xcite ( the experimental value for the total rate is @xmath47 s@xmath35 ) and a @xmath0c(@xmath4)@xmath0n cross section of ( @xmath48 @xmath6 @xcite , slightly lower , but consistent with our new result .",
    "notably , mintz and collaborators predicted the @xmath0c(@xmath4)@xmath0n cross section @xcite , but the model assumptions within the elementary particle model used in the approach of these authors are questionable and not justified for this reaction @xcite .    in summary",
    ", we have found that the consideration of a partial @xmath1 occupancy lowers the exclusive cross sections and muon capture rate noticeably , but it reduces the results for the inclusive processes only slightly .",
    "the reason for the reduction of the exclusive cross sections has been discussed above .",
    "but can one understand why the continuum rpa is apparently able to describe the inclusive processes without the need for parameter adjustment , unlike the exclusive gamow - teller transitions ?",
    "another way of thinking about this problem is the question to what extent the correlations of nucleons within the @xmath49-shell influence the results . to shed the light on this",
    ", one can evaluate the total strength of various operators @xmath50 , i.e. the norm of the vector @xmath51 , with and without the effect of correlations . note that the total strength depends only on the ground state wave function and is therefore relatively easy to evaluate .",
    "( here we follow the points made in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    for the positive parity operators this",
    "is done in table  4 .",
    "table  4 illustrates the well known fact that the @xmath49 shell correlations are very important for the gamow - teller operator @xmath52 .",
    "( note that the rpa gives the total gamow - teller strength of 5.5 , only slightly reduced when compared to the ` naive ' estimate of the independent particle model .",
    "also , the exact shell model predicts that a strength of 0.12 goes to excited @xmath53 states , which are absent in the naive model . )",
    "but the situation with the quadrupole operators is rather different .",
    "the total @xmath49 shell strength of the spin - independent operator , and the strength summed over the multipoles of the spin - dependent operators is affected by the correlations only on the @xmath54 level , even though the individual spin - dependent multipoles are affected more .",
    "moreover , the @xmath49 shell strength represents only a small fraction of the total quadrupole strength , which is concentrated in the @xmath55 excitations , unaffected by correlations as long as we assume that the ground state has only @xmath49 shell nucleons .",
    "the lowest @xmath56 resonance has a dominating @xmath57 configuration and thus its contribution to the various cross sections might be affected by the present more flexible description of the @xmath0c ground state .",
    "we find that the contribution of the @xmath56 multipole to the @xmath18-induced cross section and to the muon capture rate increases slightly ( by @xmath58 @xmath6 and @xmath59 s@xmath35 , respectively ) , but is still negligible compared to the total cross section and rate ( @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively ) .",
    "for the @xmath62-induced reaction , the effects of the partial occupancy formalism and of the improved experimental neutrino flux nearly cancel each other so that the partial cross section of the @xmath56 multipole slightly decreases ( by @xmath63 @xmath6 ) . as the total cross section",
    "is also reduced , the contribution of the @xmath56 multipole , of which the @xmath57 configuration is only a small fraction , to the total cross section is increased to @xmath64 in our present calculation .    however , the inclusive reactions we are considering are dominated by the excitations of the negative parity states . to what extent",
    "does the strength depend on the occupation of the @xmath1 subshell for these operators ? according to ref .",
    "@xcite the cross sections should be noticeably reduced when there are about 1.6 nucleons in the @xmath1 subshell . in order to test this point , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the dipole and quadrupole strength as a function of the @xmath1 subshell occupation .",
    "we find that when summed over multipoles the strength is totally independent of this occupation number .",
    "but even the individual multipoles depend on the occupation numbers only mildly .",
    "we find that the @xmath49 shell correlations are relatively unimportant for the full strength .",
    "of course , the partial occupation of the @xmath1 subshell leads to the occurrence of new states , reshifting the strength . as the @xmath1 orbital reflects an excited state compared to the @xmath23 orbital ,",
    "the strength is shifted slightly to higher energies .",
    "thus , even if the total strength is unchanged , this redistribution of strength changes the cross section due to the related change of kinematics .",
    "as the strength is shifted to higher energies , its weight in the cross section is reduced , as apparent from our results .",
    "the relative importance of this effect decreases with increasing momentum and energy transfer , explaining why we find a reduction of about @xmath65 for the @xmath18 induced experiment , while it is only @xmath66 for the @xmath62-induced reaction .",
    "the lsnd collaboration has recently conducted a search for @xmath67 oscillations for high energetic @xmath62 ( @xmath68  mev ) stemming from @xmath69 decay in flight .",
    "the oscillation signal consists of isolated , high - energy electrons ( 60  mev@xmath70200  mev ) in the detector coming from charged current @xmath0c(@xmath2)@xmath0n reactions .",
    "such events can not be caused by @xmath18-neutrinos from pion decay at rest , which are also produced in the beam stop at lampf , because their energies is lower than @xmath71  mev . in the experiment",
    "an excess in the number of these events was found , which , if interpreted as an oscillation signal , leads to an oscillation probability of @xmath72  @xcite .",
    "this value and its systematic error depends dominantly on the knowledge of the inclusive @xmath0c(@xmath2)@xmath0n cross section and the absolute neutrino flux through the detector . to aid the analysis , we present in table  5 this cross section calculated within the improved rpa model . comparing with our previous results in ref .",
    "@xcite , we find for most of the neutrino energies a reduction of the cross section between 510% . as",
    "this reduction is smaller than the 10%-error attributed to the uncertainty of @xmath0c(@xmath2)@xmath0n cross section in the lsnd - analysis  @xcite , it does not require a re - analysis of the experiment .",
    ".the rescaling factors @xmath29 of the matrix elements for the exclusive transitions were determined for both of the applied residual interactions by comparison of the calculated rates ( @xmath73 , @xmath74 ) with the experimental beta - decay rates and partial muon capture rate to the @xmath0b ground state ( in units of @xmath75 ) . also shown are the previous results ( @xmath76 , @xmath77 ) obtained for a completely filled @xmath23 subshell .
