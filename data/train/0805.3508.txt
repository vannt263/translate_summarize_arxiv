    "see , in particular , the short but useful review in @xcite .",
    "returning to the main subject of this paper , the one - dimensional inelastic model we want to study reduces to the equation @xmath3 where @xmath4 stands for the probability density function of the velocity of a molecule at time @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xmath7 being a nonnegative parameter . when @xmath8 , ( [ eq1 ] ) becomes the kac equation .",
    "it is easy to check that the fourier transform @xmath9 of @xmath4 satisfies equation @xmath10 where @xmath11 stands for the fourier transform of @xmath12 .    equation ( [ eq2 ] ) can be considered independently of ( [ eq1 ] ) , thinking of @xmath9 , for @xmath13 , as fourier ",

    "following @xcite , @xmath17 can be expressed as @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the so  called _ wild product_. the wild representation ( [ eq3 ] ) can be used to prove that the kac equations ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) have a unique solution in the class of all absolutely continuous probability measures and , respectively , in the class of the fourier ",
    "stieltjes transforms of _ all _ probability measures on @xmath21 . moreover , this very same representation , as pointed out by @xcite , can be reformulated in such a way to show that @xmath9 is the characteristic function of a completely specified sum of real  valued random variables .",
    "this represents an important point for the methodological side of the present work , consisting in studying significant asymptotic properties of @xmath9 , as @xmath22 .",
    "indeed , thanks to the mckean interpretation , our study will take advantage of methods and results pertaining to the _ central limit theorem _ of probability theory .    as to the organization of the paper , in the second part of the present section we provide the reader with preliminary information ",
    "mainly of a probabilistic nature  that is necessary to understand the rest of the paper . in section [ s2 ]",
    "we present the new results , together with a few hints to the strategies used to prove them .",

    "this analysis deals , on the one hand , with the two kinds of conditions actually used in the present paper and , on the other hand , with our conditions on @xmath94 compared with those introduced in @xcite .",
    "recall that in subsections 2.1 and 2.2 we have used an extra  condition which , in the symmetric case , reduces to @xmath258 for some @xmath259 in @xmath260 when @xmath91 belongs to @xmath235 , and for some @xmath259 in @xmath260 when @xmath91 belongs to @xmath168 provided that @xmath261 is monotonic for @xmath262 .    as to the former point under discussion , notice that for @xmath91 in @xmath235 one can resort to easy inequalities , to be explained and used in the proof of proposition [ prop5 ] , to obtain @xmath263 where , in view of ( [ eq22a ] ) , @xmath264 .",

    "_    moving on to the latter kind of comparisons , it should be recalled that @xcite , in order that initial data can satisfy ( [ eq22a ] ) , assume @xmath273 in section 4 of @xcite it is proved that ( [ eq23a ] ) _ entails _ ( [ eq21a ] ) and now we prove that ( [ eq23a ] ) _ yields _ ( [ eq22a ] ) _ when @xmath274_. indeed , from the markov inequality , @xmath275 this , combined with a well  known asymptotic expression for @xmath112 ( see , for example , sections 2.4 and 2.5 of @xcite ) , gives @xmath276 then , ( [ eq22a ] ) _ follows form _ ( [ eq23a ] ) _ when @xmath274_. this last restriction is consistent with theorem 6.2 in @xcite , mentioned in @xmath277 , and with the first part of theorem [ thm3 ] .",
    "moreover , it should be noted that classical asymptotic formulae for @xmath118 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) can be applied to exhibit simple examples of initial data which meet ( [ eq22a ] ) but do not meet ( [ eq23a ] ) . in other words ,",

    "as mentioned in the introductory paragraph of section [ s2 ]  see , in particular , explanation for ( [ eq14 ] ) , ( [ eq15_1 ] ) and ( [ eq15_2 ] )  the present section focuses on the study of the convergence in distribution of weighted sums of independent random variables .",
    "this study , besides the interest it could hold in itself , is essential for proving the theorems already stated in section [ s2 ] . in point of fact , the main steps of the arguments used to prove these theorems are set out in the propositions we get ready to enunciate and prove in the present section .",
    "specific indications of how they are used will be given in the appendix .",
    "for the present , it should be recalled that we are interested in convergence in distribution of sums @xmath279 with @xmath280 _ independent and identically distributed real  valued random variables with common distribution function @xmath94_. moreover , the numbers @xmath281 _ are assumed to satisfy _ ( [ eq15_1 ] ) - ( [ eq15_2 ] ) , and @xmath94 is supposed to be a _ symmetric element of the domain of normal attraction of _ ( [ eq7 ] ) . then according to ( @xmath98 ) and ( @xmath106 ) , there is @xmath282 satisfying @xmath283 for which @xmath284 and @xmath285 where @xmath108 is a bounded real - valued function satisfying @xmath109 as @xmath221 .",
