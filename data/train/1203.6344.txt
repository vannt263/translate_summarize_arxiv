    "a _ partition _ of a positive integer @xmath3 is a non - increasing sequence of positive integers whose sum is @xmath3 ; the number of distinct partitions of @xmath3 is traditionally denoted by @xmath4 . a _ sequence _ ( or _",
    "run _ ) in a partition is any subsequence of consecutive integers that appear as parts .",
    "integer partitions without sequences were first studied by macmahon in @xcite .",
    "he described their relationship to partitions with repeated parts , and also determined their generating series .",
    "these partitions were studied more recently by holroyd , liggett , and romik in @xcite , where the authors introduced the general family of _ partitions without @xmath0-sequences _ for any @xmath5 , in which no @xmath0 consecutive integers may all appear as parts .",
    "the number of partitions of @xmath3 without @xmath0-sequences of @xmath3 is denoted by @xmath6 , and the generating function is defined as @xmath7 these partitions were also studied by andrews @xcite , who found a ( double ) @xmath1-hypergeometric series expansion for the generating function . before giving this series , we record the definition for the @xmath1-pochhammer symbol , which is given by @xmath8    andrews showed that @xmath9    both of these earlier papers also addressed the asymptotic behavior of @xmath6 as @xmath10 .",
    "holroyd , liggett , and romik @xcite showed the asymptotic expression @xmath11 andrews @xcite substantially improved this result in the case @xmath12 , proving the asymptotic expression @xmath13 his proof relies on a beautiful and surprising relationship between @xmath14 and one of ramanujan s famous mock theta functions ; we will further discuss this connection below .",
    "the above asymptotic expression is not stated as such in andrews paper .",
    "he instead focused on the asymptotics of the generating series @xmath14 as @xmath15 .",
    "however , his results directly imply upon applying a tauberian theorem ( cf .",
    "section [ s : overpartnasymp ] of this paper ) .",
    "recently was greatly refined by the first and third authors of the present paper in @xcite .",
    "specifically , the latter paper introduced a generalization of the circle method in order to prove a series expansion for @xmath16 involving kloosterman sums , bessel functions , and principal value integrals of modified bessel functions .",
    "in this paper we study a related family of overpartitions .",
    "as introduced by corteel and lovejoy in @xcite , an overpartition is a partition in which the last occurrence of each part may be overlined .",
    "the number of overpartitions of size @xmath3 is denoted by @xmath17 .",
    "an overpartition is said to have a gap at @xmath18 if there are no parts of size @xmath18 .",
    "we define lower @xmath0-run overpartitions to be those overpartitions in which any overlined part must occur within a run of exactly @xmath0 consecutive overlined parts that terminates below with a gap .",
    "more precisely , this means that if some part @xmath19 is overlined , then there is an integer @xmath20 with @xmath21 $ ] such that each of the @xmath0 overlined parts @xmath22 appear ( perhaps together with non - overlined versions ) , while no part @xmath20 ( overlined or otherwise ) appears , and no overlined part @xmath23 appears .",
    "there is a simple bijection between lower @xmath0-run overpartitions and upper @xmath0-run overpartitions , which are defined analogously but with the conditions on parts @xmath20 and @xmath24 reversed ( see section [ s : combinatorial ] ) .",

    "the lower @xmath26-run overpartitions of size @xmath27 are @xmath28 together with the @xmath29 partitions of @xmath27 , so @xmath30 .",
    "the generating function for lower @xmath0-run overpartitions is denoted by @xmath31 our first result is analogous to andrews double - series generating function for partitions without @xmath0-sequences .",
    "[ t : gbarq ] for @xmath32 , @xmath33    our next result is an asymptotic expression for lower @xmath0-run overpartitions that is much stronger than the logarithmic expression in .",
    "[ t : pk ] as @xmath34 , @xmath35    interestingly , our techniques do not apply to the case of partitions without sequences , despite the similarity of and theorem [ t : gbarq ] .",
    "we next focus particularly on certain special cases that are related to ramanujan s mock theta functions .",
    "andrews @xcite showed that the generating function for partitions without @xmath26-sequences may be written as @xmath36 where @xmath37 which is one of ramanujan s third - order mock theta functions .",
    "ramanujan originally introduced the mock theta functions by listing a small collection of examples in his last letter to hardy @xcite .",
    "he justified his own interest by observing their striking asymptotic properties and near - symmetries under modular transformations .",
    "andrews @xcite used some of these properties in order to determine the asymptotic behavior of @xmath14 as @xmath38 , which then implies .",
    "the general theory of mock theta functions has also recently seen great advancements , as zwegers doctoral thesis @xcite has led to a proper understanding of the relationship to automorphic forms @xcite .    the case @xmath39 of lower @xmath0-run overpartitions is similarly related to another of ramanujan s third - order mock theta functions from @xcite . in particular",
    ", the mock theta function @xmath40 appears in the following expression for the generating function of lower @xmath2-run overpartitions .",
    "[ p : gbar1 ] for @xmath32 , @xmath41    note that the @xmath39 case of theorem [ t : pk ] states that @xmath42    the remainder of the paper is structured as follows . in section [",

    "s : constant ] , we apply the constant term method to determine the asymptotic behavior of the generating series . finally , in section [ s : overpartnasymp ] , we prove the asymptotic expression for @xmath0-run overpartitions found in theorem [ t : pk ] .",
    "in this section we denote the number of lower @xmath0-run overpartitions of @xmath3 by @xmath43 .",
    "we also recall the definition upper @xmath0-run overpartitions as overpartitions in which the overlined parts must occur in consecutive runs of the form @xmath44 , with no overlined parts @xmath45 , and no parts of any kind of size @xmath24 . the number of upper @xmath0-run overpartitions of size @xmath3 is denoted by @xmath46 .",
    "our first observation on @xmath0-run overpartitions is that the lower and upper definitions are in bijective correspondence .",
    "[ p : op-+ ] for all @xmath47 and @xmath48 , @xmath49    we construct a simple bijection between the two sets of overpartitions . in a lower @xmath0-run overpartition , any run of @xmath0 overlined parts occurs at the lower end of some block of consecutive parts , surrounded on both sides by gaps .",
    "that is , for some @xmath20 and some @xmath50 , all the parts @xmath51 appear ( perhaps together with further non - overlined copies of these same values ) , with gaps at @xmath20 and @xmath52 .",
    "we can form a new overpartition by shifting the @xmath0 overlines to the upper end of the block , i.e. ,  replacing the above parts with @xmath53 applying this transformation to every run of @xmath0 overlined parts results in an upper @xmath0-run overpartition , and this map is clearly bijective .",
    "we henceforth write simply @xmath54 for @xmath55 , and abbreviate the term `` lower @xmath0-run overpartition '' to @xmath0-run overpartition . it will be convenient to work with both the upper and lower definitions in different contexts . in view of proposition  [ p : op-+ ] they are interchangeable for purposes of enumeration .",

    "[ p : mono : n ] given an upper @xmath0-run overpartition of @xmath3 , adding a non - overlined part @xmath2 clearly gives an upper @xmath0-run overpartition of @xmath59 , and this map is injective .",
    "[ p : mono : k ] we construct an injection from lower @xmath60-run overpartitions to lower @xmath0-run overpartitions .",
    "if @xmath61 is a @xmath60-run overpartition and @xmath62 is a @xmath60-run , then there are no parts of size @xmath20 , and there can only be non - overlined parts of size @xmath63 . removing the overline on @xmath23 results in a @xmath0-run",
    "satisfying the lower @xmath0-run condition , and applying this to every run gives the required injection .",
    "we note that the partitions without sequences studied in @xcite satisfy the opposite inequality to that in proposition [ p : mono ] [ p : mono : k ] : @xmath64 2 .   for any fixed @xmath3",
    ", we have @xmath65 for sufficiently large @xmath0 .      in this section",
    "we consider the two - variable generating functions @xmath66 where @xmath67 is defined to be the number of @xmath0-run overpartitions of size @xmath3 and exactly @xmath68 parts .",
    "the main result in this section is a double series expansion for this generating function , which is proven from a @xmath1-difference equation for @xmath69 .",
    "[ t : gbarxq ] for @xmath32 , @xmath70    the generating function @xmath71 satisfies the @xmath1-difference equation @xmath72 which follows from the definition of ( upper ) @xmath0-run overpartitions by separating according to their smallest parts .",
    "the first term corresponds to the overpartitions without an overlined @xmath73 , in which case there is no restriction on subsequent parts ; the second term corresponds to overpartitions that do have the part @xmath73 , and thus also have each of the parts @xmath74 ( and possibly non - overlined parts of these sizes as well ) , followed by no parts of size @xmath75 .",
    "this recurrence is easier to solve after `` re - normalizing '' the equation , which is achieved by setting @xmath76 equation then implies that this normalized function satisfies the @xmath1-difference equation @xmath77 we next write this as a series in @xmath78 , where the coefficients are polynomials in @xmath1 , @xmath79 equation is equivalent to the statement that for all @xmath18 , @xmath80    by , the theorem statement is equivalent to verifying that @xmath81 is equal to the double series @xmath82 it is sufficient to show that this double series satisfies the @xmath1-difference equation , while also checking that the @xmath75 initial @xmath78-powers are compatible .",
    "denote the @xmath83 coefficient in the double series by @xmath84 ; it is clear by definition that @xmath85 and that @xmath86 , and finally @xmath87 note that @xmath0-run overpartitions with at most @xmath88 parts can contain only non - overlined parts , and thus @xmath89 the first term gives all overpartitions with no overlined parts , and the second term gives all overpartitions that consist of a single @xmath0-run of overlined parts .",
    "thus @xmath90 and the initial terms @xmath91 @xmath92 agree with those given for @xmath93 above .",

    "this completes the proof of the double series formula .      in this section",
    "we prove theorem  [ p : gbar1 ] .",
    "recall the earlier definition of ramanujan s third - order mock theta function @xmath99 this was proven by fine ( see equation ( 26.32 ) of @xcite ) to have the equivalent form @xmath100    we first describe a family of overpartitions that are in bijective correspondence with lower @xmath2-run overpartitions .",

    "furthermore , since an overlined part is the last occurrence of any part size , we distinguish it by marking the corresponding bottom - right `` corner '' .",
    "the conjugation map then simply interchanges the rows and columns of such a diagram .",
