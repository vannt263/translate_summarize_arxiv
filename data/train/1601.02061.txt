    "the self - assembly and self - organization of large numbers of microorganisms and artificial microswimmers and the non - equilibrium phase transitions that result from their collective behaviour have recently become the focus of many theoretical and experimental studies @xcite .",
    "thus , in a series of experiments , carried out with different types of artificial microswimmers , several collective phenomena have been reported such as dynamic clustering , phase separation , and swarming @xcite . in experiments with suspensions of motile living cells ( e.g. _",
    "e.coli _ and _ b.subtilis _ bacteria or spermatozoa ) , a variety of regular and irregular large- and meso - scale density patterns has been found @xcite . with the typical body size of several @xmath0 m",
    ", the colonies of motile cells exhibit arrays of circular vortices , swirls , and meso - scale turbulence with the correlation length of the collective motion ranging between @xmath1 m and @xmath2 m .",
    "the emergence of large - scale coherent structures in systems composed of small - scale self - propelled objects is universal and independent of the mechanism of motility .",
    "thus , density waves with @xmath3 m wavelengths are observed in an assay of @xmath4 m long actin filaments , driven by motor proteins @xcite .",
    "stable networks of interconnected poles and asters are found in systems of microtubuli driven by kinesin complexes @xcite .",
    "similar to the suspensions of sea urchins spermatozoa @xcite , highly coherent arrays of circular vortices were found in motile assays of microtubulus , propelled by surface - bound motor proteins @xcite . in order to explain the observed large- and meso - scale patterns , many theoretical models of interacting self - propelled particles",
    "have been suggested and tested against the experimental findings .",
    "one of the central questions of modelling is to determine the driving force and the minimal conditions for the emergence of each of the observed patterns .",
    "historically , the first class of the developed models are the so - called _ dry _ systems , in which the motion of the embedding fluid medium is neglected @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in _ wet _ systems , the motion and influence of the medium is considered as well ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . in dry systems",
    "the formation of density patterns is triggered by a linear instability of the homogeneous isotropic state ( i.e. , the trivial state ) .",
    "the instability is caused by the direct interaction between the particles , which is not mediated or induced by a solvent . in the case of",
    "electrically neutral and non - magnetic particles , the interaction mechanisms can be roughly divided into two categories .",
    "the first category deals with steric effects such as the hard - core repulsion between colliding particles @xcite .",
    "all other interaction types are due to long - range forces and fall within the second category .",
    "they have to be introduced phenomenologically , such as the aligning or anti - aligning interaction in vicsek - type flocking models , @xcite or are due to hydrodynamic @xcite or phoretic interactions @xcite .",
    "the physical mechanism of aligning interactions can be explained by collisions between swimmers with elongated bodies @xcite or by the bundling of flagellas of two colliding bacteria @xcite . the true origin of long - range anti - aligning interactions has not been properly explained yet . in the case of _ wet _ systems , the motion of the solvent medium gives rise to hydrodynamic interactions between the suspended particles @xcite .",
    "several experimental and theoretical studies show that the inclusion of hydrodynamic interactions may destabilize the polar order at high densities , thus , it effectively acts as a long - range anti - aligning force @xcite .",
    "presently , it is understood that the instability of a homogeneous suspensions of self - propelled particles can be induced by combining particle motility with either steric repulsion or with an aligning / anti - aligning interaction .",
    "thus , it has been shown that at sufficiently high mean particle density , phase separation may occur in two - dimensional systems of repulsive finite - sized swimmers or self - propelled discs @xcite .",
    "this result is explained by the self - trapping of colliding swimmers , i.e. , any two swimmers that collide and swim against each other remain in contact for a certain time span until their swimming directions have sufficiently changed .",
    "recently , it was shown that a mixture of short - range aligning and long - range anti - aligning interactions between point - like active brownian particles leads to a rich variety of density and velocity patterns in dry systems without memory @xcite and with memory @xcite .",
    "in contrast to previous studies , we demonstrate here that emergent collective dynamics in the form of persisting regular and irregular meso - scale density patterns can also be found in colonies of self - propelled particles that do not interact directly . to this end , we consider active brownian surfactant particles that move on the deformable surface of a thin liquid layer supported by a solid substrate .",
    "the direction of swimming of each particle is assumed to have a non - zero vertical component , thus , leading to particles pushing against the film surface .",
    "variations in the particle density give rise to large - scale film surface deformations that in turn induce flow in the layer of viscous fluid , which drives even more particles by advection towards denser regions and also rotates their swimming directions . particle diffusion and in particular the marangoni effect act stabilizing .",
    "we assume that the swimmers act as a surfactant , i.e. , the local surface tension decreases with swimmer concentration .",
    "this results in a soluto - marangoni effect , i.e. , marangoni forces due to concentration gradients act at the free surface of the liquid film - they are a direct consequence of entropic contributions to the free energy of the free interface plus surfactant system @xcite . in consequence , these marangoni forces act stabilizing by driving the liquid away from areas with increased particle concentration .",
    "thus , in this system the interaction between the particles is indirect and only occurs when the liquid layer dynamically deforms .",
    "the first model system of swimmers on a liquid carrier layer was introduced in ref.@xcite .",
    "there it is assumed that the particles swim exclusively upwards at all times , and are not able to move along the film surface by self - propulsion .",
    "it is shown that the resulting excess pressure onto the film surface may cause a long - wave deformational instability of the film .",
    "the picture becomes more diverse , when one allows for lateral active motion of the swimmers as well @xcite .",
    "then , a sufficiently large swimming velocity and a moderate rotational diffusion strength can suppress the long - wave instability due to the excess pressure discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the linear stability results are confirmed by hybrid ( multiscale ) discrete - continuous numerical simulations , but fully nonlinear results obtained with the continuum model become available only now .    the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec1 ] we derive the coupled long - wave evolution equations for the space- and time - dependent full swimmer density , which also includes swimmer orientation ( smoluchowski equation ) , and the space- and time - dependent film profile ( thin film equation ) .",
    "next , we present a detailed linear - stability analysis of the trivial steady state , i.e. , of a homogeneous distribution of swimmers without preferred swimming direction ( orientation ) on the surface of a flat film .",
    "different instability modes are discussed and located in a stability diagram spanned by rotational diffusion and self - propelling velocity . in section  [ sec2 ] we discuss various spatio - temporal patterns that emerge in the nonlinear regime , when the swimmers self - organize into persisting non - uniform structures . in particular , we analyse stable standing and travelling density waves accompanied by film modulation waves , travelling waves that are modulated by large scale structures , and irregular patterns .",

    "is covered by a colony of non - interacting active brownian particles .",
    "besides being microswimmers the particles act as insoluble surfactants @xcite as often found for small particles @xcite . in this way the particles",
    "are confined to move along the free surface and their density influences the interfacial energy of the free surface .",
    "the lower bound for the average film thickness of @xmath13 m is dictated by the typical size of self - propelling mono - cellular organisms such as _ e.coli _ or _ the african trypanosome _",
    "@xcite , or artificial swimmers such as phoretically driven janus particles ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the typical size @xmath14 of such swimmers is of the order of @xmath15 m although recently much smaller swimmers of @xmath16  nm have also been created @xcite . in what follows",
    "we assume a dilute limit , where the average separation distance between the swimmers is much larger than their size .",
    "in this regime , direct two - particle interactions as well as hydrodynamic interactions can be neglected .",
    "we start by deriving the equations of motion for an active brownian particle that moves along a two - dimensional time - dependent surface profile @xmath12 , as shown schematically in fig .",
    "the three - dimensional position vector of the particle is given by @xmath17 .",

    "thermal noise is characterized by a gaussian random variable with zero mean and correlation function @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath31 is the absolute temperature , and @xmath32 is a @xmath33 unit matrix .",

    "this already creates some polar order with a preferred vertical orientation of the swimmer bodies at the interface @xcite .",
    "further reasons for such a polar order can be bottom - heaviness @xcite , the chemotactic response of bacteria swimming towards the surface in order to take up oxygen @xcite , or any mechanism at the interface that aligns the particles along the vertical . in the following , we will not present a full derivation of the orientational distribution at the interface . instead , for the distribution against the surface",

    ", the time - evolution of @xmath5 is well known : it is determined by the rotation due to local fluid vorticity , alignment against some external field such as gravity , and random rotation with the rate controlled by the rotational diffusivity @xmath48 . however , for swimmers at a free surface , the rate of change @xmath49 may be significantly modified as compared to bulk swimmers depending on the nature of the interaction between the swimmers and the free film surface .",
    "for instance , a surface swimmer only partly submerged in the fluid and possibly with elongated body shape is easily rotated by local fluid vorticity within the film surface .",
    "however , the rotational rate of @xmath5 against the interface normal is possibly reduced as the interaction energies change with orientation of the swimmers at the free surface similar to anchoring effects for liquid crystals . here",

    "in particular , for parameters chosen in the vicinity of the stability threshold of the finite wave number instability , we have found a highly regular dynamic standing wave pattern by starting the simulations with small random perturbations of the trivial state .",
    "the standing wave pattern is characterised by a regular array of elevations of the free film surface that periodically transform and rearrange following a rather complex pathway .",

    "<S> we consider a colony of point - like self - propelled surfactant particles ( swimmers ) without direct interactions that cover a thin liquid layer on a solid support . </S>",
    "<S> although the particles predominantly swim normal to the free film surface , their motion also has a component parallel to the film surface . </S>",
    "<S> the coupled dynamics of the swimmer density and film height profile is captured in a long - wave model allowing for diffusive and convective transport of the swimmers ( including rotational diffusion ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of the film height profile is determined by three physical effects : the upward pushing force of the swimmers onto the liquid - gas interface that always destabilizes the flat film , the solutal marangoni force due to gradients in the swimmer concentration that always acts stabilising , and finally the rotational diffusion of the swimmers together with the in - plance active motion that acts either stabilising or destabilising . after reviewing and extending the analysis of the linear stability of the flat film with uniform swimmer density , we analyse the full nonlinear dynamic equations and show that point - like swimmers , which only interact via long - wave deformations of the liquid film , self - organise in highly regular ( standing , travelling and modulated waves ) and various irregular patterns for swimmer density and film height . </S>"
