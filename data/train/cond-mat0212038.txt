    "recently , the intermetallic compound urhge has attracted much attention because superconductivity ( @xmath3 = 0.25 k ) was found to coexist with ferromagnetism ( curie temperature @xmath4 = 9.5 k ) .",
    "@xcite the surprising discovery of superconductivity at ambient pressure in this itinerant ferromagnet was preceded by the discovery of ( pressure - induced ) superconductivity in the itinerant ferromagnets uge@xmath5 @xcite and zrzn@xmath5 .",
    "@xcite until these discoveries , it was generally believed that ferromagnetic order excludes superconductivity .",
    "this is nicely demonstrated by experiments on systems like errh@xmath6b@xmath6 @xcite and homo@xmath7s@xmath8 , @xcite where standard bcs singlet - type superconductivity is suppressed when ferromagnetic order sets in .",
    "the most likely explanation for the appearance of superconductivity in these weak itinerant ferromagnets is that the superconducting state is mediated by ferromagnetic spin fluctuations , giving rise to cooper pairs with parallel spins ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "@xcite this type of pairing is relatively insensitive to a local magnetic field and can therefore coexist with ferromagnetic order .",
    "the pressure - dependent experiments on uge@xmath5 and zrzn@xmath5 suggest that in these systems superconductivity emerges near a ferromagnetic quantum critical point , i.e. when the ferromagnetic transition temperature is tuned to @xmath10 . at the quantum critical point",
    "the ferromagnetic spin fluctuations are strongly enhanced .",
    "one may therefore expect that ferromagnetic order in urhge is also very sensitive to pressure .",
    "urhge crystallizes in the orthorhombic tinisi - type structure ( space group @xmath11 ) .",
    "@xcite the unit cell , with dimensions @xmath12  , @xmath13  , and @xmath14  , contains 4 formula units .",
    "neutron - diffraction experiments on single - crystalline urhge @xcite revealed a collinear ferromagnetic order below @xmath4 = 9.6 k with ordered u moments of 0.35 @xmath15 confined to the @xmath16 plane .",
    "no component of the ordered moment was observed along the @xmath17 axis , which acts as the hard magnetic direction for the magnetization .",
    "in addition to the neutron - diffraction experiments , the ferromagnetic order in single - crystalline urhge was studied by specific - heat , magnetization , and electrical resistivity , @xcite which showed a sizeable influence of applied magnetic fields on the ferromagnetic order and on the ferromagnetic spin fluctuations in the @xmath16 plane . in the low - temperature limit",
    ", the specific heat is characterized by the electronic contribution of the ferromagnetic spin fluctuations with a moderately enhanced linear term of @xmath18 mj / molk@xmath19 .",
    "the magnetic properties of single - crystalline urhge are in good agreement with the results from earlier measurements on polycrystalline and powder samples , @xcite which have been reviewed by sechovsky and havela .",
    "@xcite recently , band - structure calculations were performed by divis and co - workers @xcite and shick @xcite to study the origin of the magnetic order in urhge .",
    "these calculations suggest a substantial hybridization between the u-@xmath20 and rh-@xmath21 states and a relatively small uranium magnetic moment of 0.3 @xmath15 due to a partial cancellation of the spin and orbital components .",
    "the calculated moments are in good agreement with the measured values .",
    "in this paper we report thermal expansion measurements of single - crystalline urhge in the temperature range from @xmath22 = 2 to 200 k. our principal aim was to determine the pressure dependence of the ferromagnetic transition temperature @xmath4 . for a second - order phase transition",
    ", the uniaxial pressure dependence of @xmath4 ( at ambient pressure ) can be determined with the ehrenfest relation from the anomalies in the linear coefficient of thermal expansion and the specific heat .",
    "the initial pressure dependence may give an estimate of the critical pressure needed to suppress the ferromagnetic order and reach the quantum critical point at @xmath4 = 0 .",
    "in addition , we have determined the electronic grneisen parameter , which characterizes the volume dependence of the ferromagnetic spin fluctuations at low temperatures .",
    "the dilatometry experiments were performed on a single - crystalline urhge sample with dimensions @xmath23 mm@xmath24 .",
    "the sample was cut from the material used in earlier specific - heat measurements performed by hagmusa and co - workers .",
    "@xcite the crystal has been grown from a stoichiometric melt of at least 99.95 % pure materials by means of a modified tetra - arc czochralski technique in a continuous gettered ar atmosphere .",
    "no subsequent heat treatment was given to the crystal .",
    "due to the relatively high residual resistivity at low temperatures no superconductivity was observed in this particular crystal . @xcite the coefficient of linear thermal expansion @xmath25 was measured using a sensitive parallel - plate capacitance dilatometer @xcite along the orthorhombic @xmath17 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 axis of the crystal . from these measurements",
    "the volume expansion @xmath28 was determined .",
    "in fig . [ figt=2to200k ]    the coefficient of linear thermal expansion @xmath29 along the @xmath17 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 axis of single - crystalline urhge is shown as a function of temperature in the range from @xmath22  =  2 to 200 k. the temperature dependence of the volume expansion @xmath30 is shown for comparison ( notice the figure shows @xmath31 ) . at high temperatures",
    "the thermal expansion is governed by the phonon contribution for all three orientations . around a temperature of 25 k a remarkable crossing of the curves for the thermal expansion along the @xmath17 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 axis",

    "this crossing is a clear sign for the development of an additional contribution from ferromagnetic spin fluctuations at low temperatures .",

    "the corresponding pressure dependence of the curie temperature , @xmath32 , was deduced from the ehrenfest relation ( see text ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     in fig .",
    "[ figmisc0_30k ] the low - temperature volume expansion divided by temperature @xmath33 is shown as a function of temperature and compared with the specific heat divided by temperature , @xmath34 , measured on a sample prepared from the same single - crystalline batch . @xcite",
    "the temperature dependence of the thermal expansion at high temperatures is governed by the phonon contribution and closely resembles a debye curve .",
    "the estimated debye temperature of @xmath35 k is in good agreement with the specific heat data .",
    "@xcite at low temperatures the debye curve for the phonon contribution is expected to show a @xmath36 temperature dependence . below @xmath37",
    "k the thermal expansion along the @xmath17 axis shows a clear deviation of this behavior , which is even more pronounced along the @xmath26 axis .",
    "this deviation indicates the development of an additional contribution due to ferromagnetic spin fluctuations .",
    "this additional contribution was also observed in the specific heat measurements and described in terms of an enhanced electronic contribution .",
    "@xcite in the ferromagnetically ordered state below @xmath38  k the temperature dependence of the volume expansion closely resembles that of the specific heat , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figmisc0_30k ] . in line with the analysis of the specific heat measurements @xcite three different contributions to the thermal expansion can be identified in the ferromagnetically ordered state , namely contributions due to phonons , ferromagnetic spin waves , and ferromagnetic spin fluctuations .",
    "as discussed , the phonon contribution shows a @xmath36 power - law behavior at low temperatures .",
    "the ferromagnetic spin - wave contribution is expected to obey a @xmath39 power - law behavior , while the ferromagnetic spin fluctuations lead to an enhanced linear term at low temperatures .",
    "both the phonon and spin - wave contributions to the volume expansion divided by temperature @xmath40 ( and the specific heat divided by temperature @xmath34 ) vanish at low temperatures and , as a consequence , the extrapolated value of @xmath41 at @xmath42 is solely due to the contribution of the ferromagnetic spin fluctuations . as expected for an itinerant ferromagnetic system , no indications of a crystal field contribution were observed in the temperature dependence of the coefficients of linear thermal expansion .    in order to determine the uniaxial and hydrostatic pressure dependence of the ferromagnetic transition temperature we have applied the ehrenfest relation . for a second order phase transition , the uniaxial pressure dependence of the transition temperature is directly related to the step anomalies in the coefficient of linear thermal expansion and the specific heat by the ehrenfest relation : @xmath43 where the index @xmath44 refers to the orthorhombic axis , @xmath45 m@xmath24/mol is the molar volume and @xmath46 = 0.22(1 ) j / molk@xmath19 is the anomaly in the specific heat divided by temperature .",
    "@xcite by applying this relation to the experimental step anomalies in the coefficients of linear thermal expansion , the uniaxial pressure dependence of @xmath4 along the @xmath17 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 axis is obtained .",
    "the calculated values are listed in table [ steps ] .",
    "the hydrostatic pressure dependence of @xmath4 can be obtained by inserting the volume expansion for the coefficient of linear expansion in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , or by summing the three contributions of the uniaxial pressure dependence .",
    "the different pressure dependencies of @xmath4 as listed in table [ steps ] are all positive .",
    "this strongly suggests that the ferromagnetic order can not be suppressed by moderate mechanical hydrostatic or uniaxial pressures , like in the case of uge@xmath5 and zrzn@xmath5 .",
    "instead a _ negative _ uniaxial pressure is needed to suppress @xmath4 for all crystallographic directions . using a simple linear extrapolation of the initial pressure dependence calculated from the ehrenfest relation , we arrive at a negative critical hydrostatic pressure of @xmath47 kbar .",
    "it is important to note that this value should be regarded as an upper bound for the negative critical pressure as the pressure dependence of @xmath4 is expected to show significant non - linear corrections to the initial pressure dependence at ambient pressure",
    ". a negative critical pressure of the order of @xmath48 kbar might be achieved by suitable chemical substitutions .    in order to characterize the volume dependence of the electron correlations we have calculated the effective grneisen parameter of urhge .",
    "the effective grneisen parameter @xmath49 is calculated from the temperature - dependent volume expansion @xmath50 and specific heat  @xmath51 : @xmath52 where @xmath53 = -(1/@xmath54)(@xmath55 ) is the isothermal compressibility .",
    "as the compressibility of urhge is unknown we will use an estimated value @xmath56 mbar@xmath57 .",

    "@xcite    in fig .",
    "[ figmisc0_30k ]    the effective grneisen parameter @xmath49 , calculated from the experimental volume expansion and the reported specific heat @xcite , is shown as a function of temperature . at high temperatures",
    "the effective grneisen parameter shows a small constant value of @xmath60 and describes the volume dependence of the characteristic energy scale for the phonons .",
    "below 30  k the effective grneisen parameter rapidly increases and reaches a value of @xmath61 just above @xmath4 .",
    "below @xmath4 a weak suppression of the effective grneisen parameter is observed with a slow increase for decreasing temperatures . in the low temperature limit",
    "@xmath49 corresponds to the enhanced electronic grneisen parameter @xmath62 of the ferromagnetic spin fluctuations .",
    "the corresponding relative pressure dependence of the electronic specific heat amounts to @xmath63 mbar@xmath57 .",
    "the relation between magnetic order and the spin fluctuations can further be studied by comparing the volume dependence of the energy scales for the ferromagnetic order ( @xmath4 ) and the ferromagnetic spin fluctuations ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "it turns out that the grneisen parameter for the ferromagnetic order @xmath65 is of the same order of magnitude and has the same sign as the grneisen parameter for the ferromagnetic spin fluctuations @xmath66 .",
    "this situation is in strong contrast to pressure - induced antiferromagnetic superconductors like cepd@xmath5si@xmath5 @xcite where the antiferromagnetic order competes with the spin fluctuations with an opposite scaling behavior with volume .",
    "it can therefore be expected that the spin - mediated superconductivity of urhge exists over a wide pressure range , as observed for the ferromagnetic superconductor zrzn@xmath5 .",
    "@xcite this in contrast to the situation in the ferromagnetic superconductor uge@xmath5 , @xcite where superconductivity is only observed in a small pressure region close to the critical pressure where the ferromagnetic order is suppressed .",
    "we have performed thermal expansion measurements on a single - crystalline sample of the ferromagnet urhge . below the ferromagnetic ordering temperature of @xmath38 k an increase in the coefficient of linear thermal expansion",
    "was observed along all three orthorhombic axes .",
    "the uniaxial pressure dependence of the ferromagnetic transition temperature was determined by the ehrenfest relation from the anomalies in the coefficients of linear thermal expansion and the specific heat .",
    "we find positive values of @xmath32 for all principal axes .",
    "consequently , the hydrostatic pressure dependence is also positive and amounts to @xmath67 = 0.12 k / kbar .",
    "this contrasts the behavior reported for uge@xmath5 and zrzn@xmath5 .",
    "in addition , the effective grneisen parameter was determined .",
