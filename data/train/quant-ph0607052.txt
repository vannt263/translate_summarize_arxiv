    "reconstruction of the photon statistics , @xmath0 , of optical states provides fundamental information on the nature of any optical field and finds relevant applications in foundations of quantum mechanics , quantum state engineering by postselection @xcite , quantum information @xcite , and quantum metrology .",
    "indeed , detectors with the capability of counting photons @xcite are currently under investigation . among these ,",
    "photomultiplier tubes ( pmt s ) @xcite and hybrid photodetectors @xcite are promising devices , though they have the drawback of a low quantum efficiency . on the other hand ,",
    "solid state detectors with internal gain are still under development .",
    "highly efficient thermal detectors have also been used as photon counters , though their operating conditions are still extreme to allow common use @xcite .",
    "the advent of quantum tomography provided an alternative method to measure photon number distributions @xcite .",
    "however , tomography needs the implementation of homodyne detection , which involves challenging mode matching , especially in the case of pulsed optical fields .    in principle , in a photodetector each photon ionizes a single atom , and the resulting charge is amplified to produce a measurable pulse . in practice , however , available photodetectors are usually characterized by a quantum efficiency lower than unity , which means that only a fraction of the incoming photons leads to an electric pulse .",
    "if the resulting current is proportional to the incoming photon flux we have a linear photodetector .",
    "this is , for example , the case of the high - flux photodetectors used in homodyne detection . on the other hand photodetectors operating at very low intensities usually resort to avalanche process or very high amplification in order to transform a single ionization event into a recordable pulse . due to the gain instability in the process of amplification",
    "it is generally difficult to discriminate the number of detected photons as far as this number becomes larger .    as",
    "a consequence the output of a photodetector consists of a current pulses whose charge statistics is a generalized bernoulli convolution of the actual photon distribution with the possibility to perform a discrimination between the number of detected photons only up to a finite number .",
    "we define @xmath1 as the maximum number @xmath2 of detected photons that can be distinguished from @xmath3 , @xmath1 represent the counting capability of the detectors : @xmath4 detectors that works in geiger mode have @xmath5 because form the output is possible to discriminate from @xmath6 , one detected photon , to @xmath7 , dark , but is not possible to discriminate the output for @xmath8 from that for to @xmath6 .",
    "the inversion of such a convolution may be performed in several ways , though , in general it is possible only when the quantum efficiency is larger than @xmath9 @xcite , and it is inherently inefficient , as it requires a large data sample to provide a reliable result . on the other hand , maximum - likelihood methods assisted by measurements taken at different quantum efficiencies have been proved to be both effective and statistically reliable @xcite . in particular , it is possible to obtain a method to reconstruct @xmath10 _ without any a priori information _ on the state of light under investigation .",
    "an alternative approach is based on the so called _ photon chopping _",
    "i.e. _ on a network of beam splitter followed by an array of on / off detectors .",
    "photon chopping allows to send at most one photon on each detector , however , with the drawback of increasing the overall complexity of the detection scheme .    in this paper , we extend previous analysis on maximum - likelihood on / off - based schemes @xcite , and present a detailed comparison among the performances of detectors characterized by realistic quantum efficiencies and different values of @xmath1 .",
    "the comparison is made using real data and by an extensive set of monte carlo simulations , performed on different states of the radiation field including quantum and semiclassical states associated to single - peaked as well as multi - peaked photon distributions .",
    "the reconstruction is obtained by maximum - likelihood methods assisted by measurements taken at different quantum efficiencies . in particular , as the statistics of the detected photons is linearly dependent on the photon distribution ( see below ) , the inversion can be well approximated by using the expectation - maximization algorithm ( em ) which leads to an effective and reliable iterative solution .",
    "our results indicates that detectors with @xmath11 discriminating between zero , one and more than one photon , are generally enough to provide a reliable reconstruction of the photon statistics for single - peaked distributions , while detectors with higher value of @xmath1 do not lead to further improvements . on the other hand ,",
    "multi - peaked distributions requires a higher quantum efficiency whereas for semiclassical states even on / off detectors are enough to provide a good reconstruction .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe the statistics of the detected photons and illustrate the reconstruction algorithm . in section [",
    "s : sim ] we report the results of a set of monte carlo simulated experiments performed on different kinds of signals , whereas in section [ s : exp ] we report experimental results for coherent signals .",
    "section [ s : out ] closes the paper with some concluding remarks .",
    "using a photodetector with quantum efficiency @xmath12 and @xmath13 , that corresponding to an unlimited counting capability , the probability of obtaining @xmath2 detected photons at the output is given by the convolution @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the actual photon statistics of the signal under investigation and @xmath16 if @xmath1 have a finite value only @xmath17 outcomes are possible , which occur with probabilities @xmath18 once the value of the quantum efficiency is known , eqs .",
    "( [ kappa1 ] ) and ( [ kappa2 ] ) provide @xmath1 relations among the statistics of detected photons and the actual statistics of photons . at first sight",
    "the statistics of a detector with low counting capability ( @xmath1 in the range @xmath19 ) appears to provide quite a scarce piece of information about the state under investigation .",
    "however , if the statistics about @xmath20 is collected for a suitably large set of efficiency values , then the information is enough to reconstruct the whole photon distribution @xmath21 of the signal , upon a suitable truncation at @xmath22 of the hilbert space .",
    "we adopt the following strategy : by placing in front of the detector @xmath23 filters with different transmissions , we may perform the detection with @xmath23 different values @xmath24 , @xmath25 , ranging from zero to a maximum value",
    "@xmath26 equal to the nominal quantum efficiency of the detector . by denoting the probability of having @xmath2 detected photons in the experiment with quantum efficiency @xmath27 by @xmath28 we can rewrite eqs .",
    "( [ kappa1 ] ) and ( [ convoluzio0 ] ) as @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "let us now suppose that the @xmath21 s are negligible for @xmath32 and that the @xmath24 s are known , then @xmath33 eq .  ( [ convoluzio ] ) may be rewritten a finite sum over @xmath34 from @xmath2 to @xmath22 .",
    "overall , we obtain a finite linear system with @xmath35 equations in the @xmath22 unknowns @xmath36 .",
    "unfortunately , the reconstruction of @xmath21 by matrix inversion can not be used in practice since it would require an unreasonable number of experimental runs to assure the necessary precision @xcite .",
    "this problem can be circumvented by considering eqs .",
    "( [ convoluzio ] ) as a statistical model for the parameters @xmath36 to be solved by maximum - likelihood ( ml ) estimation .",

    "( [ iterazio ] ) provides a solution once an initial distribution is chosen . in the following",
    "we will always consider an initial uniform distribution @xmath49 @xmath50 in the truncated fock space @xmath51 .",
    "results from monte carlo simulated experiments shows that any distribution with @xmath52 @xmath50 performs equally well , _",
    "i.e. _ the choice of the initial distribution does not alter the quality of reconstruction , though it may slightly affect the convergence properties of the algorithm .",
    "in this section we report the photon statistics for different states of a single - mode radiation field as obtained by ml reconstruction from monte carlo simulated photodetection performed with the same low quantum efficiency and different resolution threshold .",
    "we consider semiclassical states as well as highly nonclassical states and show results for different values of the maximal quantum efficiency @xmath53 .",
    "@xmath54    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     let us now illustrate our results about the accuracy of the reconstructions . as mentioned above we performed simulated experiments , on semiclassical states like coherent and thermal ones as well as highly nonclassical states such fock states , by using three values for the maximum quantum efficiency @xmath55 .",
    "simulations have been performed by using @xmath56 data at each value of the quantum efficiency .",
    "this value of @xmath47 is relatively small and well within the realm of quantum optical experiment . in a real experiment performed under the same conditions , @xmath47 of",

    "[ fig : tanti ] we show the fidelity of reconstruction @xmath57 at the last iterations , @xmath58 , for different input signals and different resolution thresholds as a function of the average number of photons of the signal . as it is apparent from the plots , for low quantum efficiency and semiclassical states on / off detectors ( @xmath5 )",
    "are enough to achieve a good reconstruction . on the other hand ,",
    "the accuracy for nonclassical states largely improves for @xmath59 . for higher values of the quantum efficiency ( the middle and the right plots ) on / off",
    "detectors becomes sufficient for a good reconstruction also for nonclassical states having single - peaked distributions .",
    "notice that a higher resolution , however with a low value of @xmath60 , does not guarantee a good reconstruction . also notice that the results reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : tanti ] has been obtained by stop the algorithm according to the prescriptions mentioned above .",

    "[ fig : tanti ] for greater mean values is due to the choice of a small dimension of the truncated hilbert space : by increasing n the trend disappear .",
    "the low values of @xmath58 for the superposition states are due to the noise in @xmath61 , also for the high quantum efficiencies .",
    "indeed , by increasing @xmath47 the reconstructions greatly improves ; besides , for high quantum efficiency the detectors perform good reconstructions also for @xmath62 , see the inset of panel s2 ) in fig .",

    "the error bars in fig .",
    "[ fig : tanti ] are standard deviations of @xmath58 as calculated from 40 different monte carlo runs .",
    "they may appear large , but this is due to the high value of @xmath58 , which in turn determines the scale of the plot .",
    "look at panels s) for comparison .",
    "in order to confirm the monte carlo results for single - peaked distributions we have performed the reconstruction of the photon statistics of a coherent signal obtained from a nd : ylf laser .",
    "the experimental data have been recorded with a hybrid photo detector , hamamatsu h8236 - 40 , placed on the second harmonics ( 523.5 nm ) of a cw mode - locked nd : ylf laser regeneratively amplified at a repetition rate of 5 khz ( high q laser ) .",
