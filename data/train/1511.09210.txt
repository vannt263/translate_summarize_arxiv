    "highly selective first - level triggers are essential to exploit the full physics potential of the atlas experiment at the hl - lhc where the instantaneous luminosity will exceed the lhc run 1 instantaneous luminosity by almost an order of magnitude . in order to cover the interesting electroweak physics processes ,",
    "the goal for the level-1 muon trigger is to maintain a trigger for single muons that is fully efficient at @xmath6 without the need for prescaling .",
    "figure  [ fig:1_muon_xsec ] shows the differential cross - section @xmath9 for the dominant muon production processes as function of the muon transverse momentum at a centre - of - mass energy of @xmath7 in the pseudo - rapidity range @xmath8 .",
    "it is obvious that in order to suppress the steeply rising cross - section for @xmath10 , a very good momentum resolution for the muon trigger and a sharp turn - on of the trigger efficiency is required .     at the three trigger stages",

    "the atlas experiment plans to increase the acceptable trigger rate of the first two trigger levels to @xmath11 at @xmath12 latency and @xmath13 at @xmath14 latency , respectively .",
    "this requires to replace the electronics for the muon trigger decision , as well as the read - out electronics of the muon trigger chambers and the precision monitored drift tube ( mdt ) chambers .",
    "the replacement of the precision chamber read - out electronics will make it possible to include their data in the first - level trigger decision and to increase the selectivity of the first - level muon trigger  @xcite",
    ". the mdt - based muon trigger will be implemented at level-0 of the new atlas trigger system for hl - lhc , which will replace the current level-1 .    the improvements on the current atlas level-1 muon trigger efficiency is illustrated in figure  [ fig:1_efficiency ] , which shows the efficiency at the three trigger stages level-1 , level-2 and event filter .",
    "the resolution of the level-1 mdt trigger is expected to be very close to the one of the level-2 , resulting in a turn - on as indicated in the figure and a substantial rate reduction from the existing level-1 trigger  @xcite .",
    "two possible concepts for a level-1 mdt trigger are currently under study .",
    "in the two - station concept , the two outer of the three layers of the mdt chambers are used .",
    "the muon momentum is determined from the deflection angle in the magnetic field comparing the two measured track segments in the layers . the rate reduction for the two - station concept has been determined using atlas data at @xmath2 .",
    "it is found to be in the order of @xmath15 across the entire @xmath16-coverage of the muon spectrometer  @xcite .",
    "the three - station concept makes use of all three layers of the mdt precision chambers and relies on the excellent spatial resolution of the mdt chambers , which exceeds the angular resolution by a factor of about two .",
    "hence , the performance of the three - station concept is expected to be comparable to the one from the level-2 trigger . in this contribution , the resolution and efficiency of the three - station concept is studied , using data from the atlas data taking at @xmath2 .",
    "the atlas detector consists of a tracking system in a @xmath17 axial magnetic field up to a pseudorapidity - axis along the beam pipe .",

    "cylindrical coordinates @xmath20 are used in the transverse plane , @xmath21 being the azimuthal angle around the @xmath22-axis .",

    "a detailed description of the atlas detector can be found elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the muon spectrometer consists of the barrel region with @xmath28 , and the end - cap region with @xmath29 .",
    "the magnet system is divided accordingly , where both barrel and end - cap toroid magnets consist of eight coils each , resulting in an eightfold symmetry . in the barrel ,",
    "three layers of mdt chambers are installed . in the area between the magnet coils , the so - called _ large sectors",

    "so - called _ small sectors _ , the chambers are placed in a distance of @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "while the magnetic field strength is higher for the small sectors , muons in this region suffer from multiple interactions with the additional passive material of the magnets and their support structure .",
    "the middle and outer layer in the barrel are equipped with additional resistive plate chambers ( rpcs ) dedicated to fast triggering for the current level-1 trigger .",
    "the end - cap consists of three discs with large sectors at a distance of @xmath36@xmath37 , @xmath36@xmath38 , and @xmath36@xmath39 and small sectors at a distance of @xmath36@xmath40 , @xmath36@xmath41 , and @xmath36@xmath42 from the interaction point .",
    "the new small wheel ( nsw ) replaces the innermost layer of the current end - cap of the muon detector for the hl - lhc and will use micromegas .",
    "the middle and outermost layer of the end - cap are build from mdt chambers .",
    "three layers of dedicated thin gap chambers ( tgcs ) for fast triggering are installed around the middle layer of the end - cap .    due to the large size and weight of the detector ,",
    "some areas in the @xmath16-@xmath21 space are not fully covered by muon detectors , in particular the transition between the barrel and the end - cap at @xmath43 , as well as the support structure of the detector at @xmath44 .",
    "hence , these regions have been excluded from the study .",
    "the trigger concept is illustrated in figure  [ fig:2_concept ] , which shows a side view of one quadrant of the atlas detector .",
    "the level-1 mdt trigger relies on the regions of interest ( roi ) defined by the dedicated existing level-1 trigger chambers .",
    "the rois are built from hits in the rpcs and tgcs , which can be extrapolated to all three layers of the precision mdt chambers using their position and momentum information .    in the barrel",
    ", the muon track is measured at the three space points around the rois .",
    "the transverse momentum of the muon is determined from the curvature of the muon track in the middle layer by calculating the sagitta @xmath45 from the projection of the track on the sector normal in @xmath21 .",
    "the sagitta is defined by the shortest distance of the measured track segment in the middle layer with respect to a straight line between the track segments in the inner and outer layer . in the end - cap region ,",
    "the muon track is measured at three space points given by nsw , middle end - cap ( em ) and outer end - cap ( eo ) . due to the position of the end - cap magnet , the magnetic field",
    "is limited to the space between the inner and middle end - cap layer .",
    "hence , the most sensitive method to determine the transverse momentum of the muon is from the curvature inside those two layers .",
    "the measured quantity is the distance @xmath46 between the track segment in the inner layer , and the extrapolated track from the measured track segments in the middle and outer layer of the end - cap .",
    "data from the atlas data taking at @xmath2 , corresponding to an integrated luminosity of @xmath47 , is used for this study .",
    "the events are preselected by having at least one positive trigger decision among all the muon trigger items .",

    "it has the best transverse momentum resolution and hence is considered as reference algorithm .",
    "the _ standalone _",
    "algorithm reconstructs the muon transverse momentum with information from the muon spectrometer only .",
    "it represents the benchmark for the trigger algorithm .",
    "quantities measured with the combined and standalone algorithm are indicated by the superscripts @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively . due to energy loss in the calorimeters ,",
    "the standalone momentum is systematically lower than the combined momentum , therefore the standalone momentum has to be corrected by the most probable energy loss @xmath50 during the passage from the interaction point to the muon spectrometer .",
    "the most probable energy loss of muons with @xmath51 in large barrel sectors is @xmath52 , while the most probable energy loss in the end - cap sectors is @xmath53 .",
    "the level-1 mdt trigger algorithm is studied on basis of muon track segments as reconstructed in the individual layers of the mdt chambers .",
    "the track segments are required to have at least six hits , and each layer is required to have one track segment in the region of interest . in the overlap region between small and large sectors ,",
    "information from only one sector type is used . for simplicity ,",
    "only positively charged muons with @xmath54 are considered .",
    "it has been verified that negatively charged muons and muons in the region @xmath55 give similar results .",

    "the trigger s efficiency is defined as the ratio of events passing the threshold over all events in a certain momentum range .",
    "a trigger can be considered fully efficient once it reaches a plateau of @xmath61 . for a momentum resolution with a gaussian shape ,",

    "albeit the gaussian core of the distribution is narrow , with a width of a standard deviation @xmath68 , there are non - gaussian tails , particularly in the barrel region , resulting from energy loss fluctuations . as the energy loss fluctuations set a fundamental limit on the momentum resolution and",
    "hence on the convergence of the trigger efficiency at the plateau , being fully efficient at @xmath69 comes at the cost of a reduced rate reduction .",
    "one should note that in the end - cap region the combined reconstruction algorithm relies predominantly on the muon spectrometer data , resulting in a non - negligible correlation between the two values and a possible overestimation of the resolution .",

    ". the turn - on curve reaches @xmath70 efficiency at @xmath6 and becomes fully efficient at @xmath71 . the fact that the trigger is not fully efficient at @xmath6 using the @xmath63 estimation is caused by energy loss fluctuations , which are responsible for the non - gaussian tails of the momentum resolution distribution . in order to be fully efficient at @xmath6 a lower threshold of @xmath72 has to be chosen , as shown in figure  [ fig:3_efficiency_endcap_99 ]",
