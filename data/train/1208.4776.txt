    "entangled photon hole ( eph ) states are new form of entanglement that is based on the existence of `` missing pairs '' of photons in two optical modes @xcite . these states have now been observed in the laboratory @xcite , and their nonclassical properties have been experimentally demonstrated @xcite .",
    "it has recently been shown that these states can be relatively insensitive to loss and amplification noise @xcite , which may be beneficial for quantum communication applications such as quantum key distribution @xcite .",
    "all of these initial studies @xcite have only considered a kind of _ energy - time _",
    "eph state @xcite where , roughly speaking , the time - scale associated with the correlated absences ( ie .",
    "the `` photon - holes '' ) is much shorter than the coherence - time of the background states in which they exist .",
    "motivated by the many different forms of entangled photon - pair states ( eg . polarization entanglement @xcite , momentum entanglement @xcite , etc . ) , this naturally raises the question of what other forms of eph states might look like . along these lines , in this paper we introduce the idea of _ time - bin _ eph states , in analogy with time - bin entangled photon - pair states pioneered by gisin s group @xcite .",
    "the initial eph studies @xcite have also only considered the case where the background in which the photon - holes exist is formed by coherent states .",
    "this raises questions about the possibility of photon - holes in different types of background states , such as thermal states or even various nonclassical states .",
    "here we consider time - bin eph s in a background formed by highly nonclassical single - photon states .",
    "the combination of time - bins and single - photon background is particularly useful for illustrating the concept of eph s by comparison and contrast with more familiar entangled photon - pair states . indeed , as the coherent state background is replaced by single - photon state background , a basic time - bin eph state becomes fully equivalent to an antisymmetric time - bin entangled photon - pair state .",
    "this relatively simple scenario provides insight into the properties of more general eph states , such as energy - time eph s in coherent - state background @xcite , which do not have direct equivalences with entangled photon - pair states .    in section [ sec : overview ]",
    ", we overview the basic idea of time - bin eph s and transition from a general coherent - state background to a background formed formed by single - photon states . in section [ sec : experiment ] we describe a proof - of - principle experimental demonstration of time - bin eph s in single - photon background using a conventional parametric down - conversion ( pdc ) photon - pair source @xcite and techniques from the linear optics quantum computing ( loqc ) toolbox @xcite . here the time - bin eph states are sent into a `` franson interferometer '' @xcite and used to violate a bell - type inequality @xcite . in section [ sec : summary ] we summarize and discuss further applications of eph states .",
    "perhaps the easiest way to visualize eph states is by contrasting them with well - known photon - pair states produced by pdc .",
    "the original proposal for energy - time eph s used two - photon absorption as a nonlinearity which simultaneously removes one photon from each of two coherent states @xcite . in some sense , this is the direct opposite of continuous - wave ( cw ) pumped pdc , where a @xmath0 nonlinearity is used to simultaneously create one photon in each of two vacuum states @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the creation / removal of the two photons occurs at the same time , but that time is completely uncertain , which is essentially the origin of the energy - time entanglement in these states @xcite .    in this way",
    ", eph s can be thought of as the `` negative image '' of pdc @xcite . yet",
    "this analogy is not complete because the idea of a `` single hole '' ( in contrast to a single pdc photon ) is meaningless , and there can be many `` missing pairs '' in an eph state , whereas an idealized pdc state contains just one photon - pair .",
    "consequently , a better analogy is drawn by contrasting the relevant two - photon amplitudes involved in pdc vs. eph states @xcite .    to illustrate this analogy , figure [ fig : energytimeoverview ] shows two different forms of two - photon amplitudes ( ie . the biphoton picture @xcite ) for both energy - time pdc states and energy - time eph states . here",
    "the term @xmath1 represents the probability amplitude for detecting one photon in each output mode ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) at the same time , as function of an overall time @xmath4 .",
    "the term @xmath5 represents the probability amplitude for detecting two photons at two different times ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) , as a function of the difference in these times .     and",
    "@xmath1 , is found in the main text .",
    "the amplitudes have been normalized to 1 in each plot for convenience.,width=336 ]    figure [ fig : energytimeoverview](a ) shows the familiar scenario for an idealized cw pdc source . here",
    "the pdc crystal can only produce the two photons at the same time , so the amplitude @xmath5 is zero everywhere except near @xmath8 as shown in figure [ fig : energytimeoverview](b ) ( the width and shape of this peak is determined by phase - matching considerations and other details of the pdc process @xcite ) .",
    "due to the cw nature of the pdc pump , this photon - pair can be produced at any time with equal probability , so the amplitude @xmath1 is a constant value for all times @xmath4 as shown in figure [ fig : energytimeoverview](c ) .",
    "in contrast , figure [ fig : energytimeoverview](d ) shows the energy - time eph scenario of reference @xcite . here ,",
    "two narrowband weak coherent - states @xmath9 and @xmath10 pass through an idealized two - photon absorption ( tpa ) medium .",
    "the central frequencies of these coherent - states are non - degenerate , and chosen in such a way that the tpa medium does nothing to either beam by itself , but absorbs one photon from each state if they pass through at the same time @xcite .",
    "consequently , the amplitude @xmath5 is a constant value everywhere , but goes towards zero near @xmath8 as shown in figure [ fig : energytimeoverview](e)(the width and shape of this dip is determined by the lifetimes of the relevant states and other properties of the tpa system @xcite ) . in the the idealized limit of infinitely strong tpa , the probability of detecting two photons at the same time is always zero , so the amplitude @xmath11 for all times @xmath4 as shown in figure [ fig : energytimeoverview](f ) .",
    "contrasting the two - photon amplitudes of figures [ fig : energytimeoverview](b ) vs. [ fig : energytimeoverview](e ) , and figures [ fig : energytimeoverview](c ) vs. [ fig : energytimeoverview](f ) provides a clear analogy of eph s as the `` negative image '' of pdc .",
    "we now use this analogy to introduce the idea of time - bin eph s , which is the primary thrust of this paper .",
    "the main idea is to confine the usual cw background of figure [ fig : energytimeoverview](d ) into two well - defined time - bins . as in the case of gisin s",
    "time - bin entangled photon pairs @xcite , this is accomplished using short optical pulses and unbalanced mach - zehnder interferometers ( mz s ) .",
    "figure [ fig : timebinoverview](a ) first shows the standard scenario for time - bin entangled photon pairs produced by pulsed pdc @xcite . here a short pumping pulse is divided into two coherent amplitudes by a mz before the pdc crystal .",
    "the source produces one pair of photons in a superposition of two time bins ( labeled @xmath12 and @xmath13 for `` early '' and `` late '' ) separated by the mz imbalance time @xmath14 .",
    "the photons will always be found in the same time - bin , so again @xmath5 is only non - zero when @xmath8 as shown in figure [ fig : timebinoverview](b ) .",
    "however , the possible pair production time is now confined to the two time bins , so @xmath1 shows only two peaks separated by @xmath14 as shown in figure [ fig : timebinoverview](c ) .",
    "time - bin eph states are now constructed by designing a system that produces the `` negative image '' of figures [ fig : timebinoverview](b ) and [ fig : timebinoverview](c ) .",
    "one conceptual method is illustrated in figure [ fig : timebinoverview](d ) . here",
    "two non - degenerate coherent - state pulses pass through two independent mz s before entering the idealized tpa medium .",
    "the response time of the tpa process is assumed to be much shorter than @xmath14 , so that pairs of photons ( one in each mode ) in different time bins pass through without absorption . however , the possibility of two photons ( one in each mode ) exiting in the same time - bin is removed by the tpa process .",
    "consequently , @xmath5 shows two separated background peaks , but a missing central peak at @xmath8 as shown in figure [ fig : timebinoverview](e ) .",
    "the tpa process also causes @xmath15 in all time - bins , as shown [ fig : timebinoverview](f ) .    considering the relevant time - bins , by contrasting the amplitudes shown in figures [ fig : timebinoverview](b ) vs. [ fig : timebinoverview](e ) , and figures [ fig : timebinoverview](c ) vs. [ fig : timebinoverview](f )",
    ", it can be seen that the pulsed source of figure [ fig : timebinoverview](d ) generates time - bin eph s .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the pulses of figure [ fig : timebinoverview](d ) are thus far assumed to be coherent states , which provides time - bin eph s in a coherent state background .",
    "this case is particularly relevant , as it is essentially the coherent state background which allows eph states to be amplified under certain conditions @xcite , and time - bin techniques are known to be generally robust in quantum systems @xcite . because the dominant sources of errors in quantum communication systems can originate from loss and polarization errors @xcite , the combination of these two ideas might offer practical benefits for future systems .    on a more fundamental level , however , it is interesting to consider replacing the coherent state input pulses in figure [ fig : timebinoverview](d ) with single - photon input pules . in this case , the two - photon amplitudes in figures [ fig : timebinoverview](e ) and [ fig : timebinoverview](f ) remain the same , but the system produces time - bin eph s in a single - photon background .",
    "this case is particularly instructive , because a time - bin eph state in a background formed by single - photon states becomes physically identical to one of the conventional time - bin entangled photon - pair bell - states :    @xmath16    where the kets @xmath17 and @xmath18 represent , respectively , a single - photon in the early or late time - bin .    in other words ,",
    "there are known to be exactly two photons in the system ( one in each output mode ) , but the existence of the holes prevents them from being found in the same time - bin .",
    "this appears to be the limiting case where eph states and entangled photon - pair states reduce to the same physical state .",
    "therefore , this relatively simple scenario provides insight into the fundamental nature of eph states in more complicated scenarios such as energy - time eph s in a single - photon backgrounds , and more useful eph states in coherent - state backgrounds @xcite .",
    "additionally , this unique combination of time - bins and single - photon background allows an experimental investigation of time - bin eph s with current technology .",
    "indeed , a direct realization of the system sketched in figure [ fig : timebinoverview](d ) ( for coherent - state or single - photon backgrounds ) would require strong tpa at single - photon intensities , which is exactly the type of nonlinearity needed for photonic quantum computing @xcite and is beyond the reach of current technology .",
    "however , by considering single - photon backgrounds , proof - of principle eph experiments can be done by starting with two single photons and putting them in time - bins in such a way as to realize the state of eq .",
    "( [ eq : elvsle ] ) . in our experiment",
    ", we accomplish this using two photons produced from a typical cw pdc source , as will be described in the next section .",
    "a conceptual overview of our experimental demonstration of time - bin eph s is shown in figure [ fig : experimentoverview ] .",
    "the idea is to perform a bell - inequality test by sending time - bin eph states through a conventional franson interferometer @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", we consider a franson arrangement using the polarization - based unbalanced mz interferometers of reference @xcite to eliminate the need for large path - length imbalances and fast electronics .",
    "the eph state of interest is generated by forming the background using two orthogonally polarized single - photons ( denoted by the red and blue circles labeled @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) separated by a time @xmath14 , and mixing them at a 50/50 beamsplitter . because post - selection in the output of the franson interferometer will only register cases in which one background photon passes through each mz , the relevant part of the two - photon state at the output of the 50/50 beamsplitter is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : elvsle ] ) .",
    "the `` early - late '' and `` late - early '' terms of this background photon - pair state are denoted graphically by the two `` linked '' amplitudes in figure [ fig : experimentoverview ] , while the eph state itself is perhaps best described by the two - photon amplitudes of figures [ fig : timebinoverview](e ) and [ fig : timebinoverview](f ) .     and mixed at a 50/50 beamsplitter .",
    "post - selection at the output of a franson - interferometer realizes the time - bin eph state in the background state given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : slvsls ] ) .",
    "polarization - encoding and polarizing beamsplitters ( pbs ) are used to simplify the actual experiment @xcite.,width=336 ]    the polarizing beamsplitters ( pbs s ) direct horizontally polarized amplitudes along the short arms of the mz s , and vertically polarized amplitudes along the long arms , while polarizers oriented at @xmath21 in the outputs erase any which - path information @xcite .",
    "consequently , the franson interferometer of figure [ fig : experimentoverview ] transforms the background photon - pair state of eq .",
    "( [ eq : elvsle ] ) into the state :    @xmath22    where the kets @xmath23 and @xmath24 represent , respectively , a single - photon in the short or long arms of the unbalanced mz s , and @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the relevant phase differences ( an overall phase - factor has been omitted ) .    when the path - length imbalances of the mz s are set to match @xmath14 , the two terms in eq .",

    "the dependence on the difference or sum of spatially separated phases is the signature of nonlocal behavior . as in the more typical case",

    "figure [ fig : experimentalsetup ] shows our experimental setup used to implement the idea of figure [ fig : experimentoverview ] .",
    "a type - i pdc source ( 0.7 mm thick bbo crystal ) was pumped by a cw ultraviolet diode laser ( @xmath35 40 mw at 407 nm , @xmath35 0.1 nm linewidth ) .",
    "the source produced horizontally polarized photon pairs at 814 nm which were coupled into a 50/50 single - mode - fiber beamsplitter .",
    "translatable glass wedges were used to introduce and adjust the time - bin separation @xmath14 , and fiber polarization controllers ( fpc s ) on the input ports of the beamsplitter were used to prepare the states @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",

    "the pm fibers were 2 meters long , which gave a mz path length imbalance of @xmath36 2.6 ps for the 814 nm photons .",
    "this imbalance greatly exceeded the coherence - time of the pdc photons ( @xmath35 200 fs ) , as required in franson interferometry @xcite .    .",

    "the vertical axis changed its effective thickness and allowed smooth scanning of @xmath25 . for completeness",
    ", we added or removed a quarter - wave plate at the output of pm fiber 2 for two different relative values of @xmath26 ( @xmath37 or @xmath38 ) .    from a technical point of view , this setup was very robust against phase drifts .",

    "( [ eq : slvsls ] ) is insensitive to the relative phase difference between the two original photons @xcite .",
    "consequently , the delay @xmath14 introduced by the glass wedges ( and set equal to that of the pm fibers ) only needed to be adjusted to within the coherence length of the pdc photons , rather than interferometrically stabilized ; this is similar to the case of typical hong - ou - mandel experiments @xcite .",
