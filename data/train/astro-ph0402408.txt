    "the distance of x - ray binaries is challenging to determine precisely .",
    "they are usually too distant for current parallax measurements , and there are no really reliable standard candles , other than type - i x - ray bursts showing radius expansion , and these only occur in a subset of neutron star systems ( see @xcite and references therein ) . for black holes , such as gx3394 ,",
    "the problem is much less tractable .",
    "fortunately the majority of such systems undergo periods of deep quiescence when it is possible to detect the companion star , and determine the binary parameters .",
    "hence both the radius and temperature ( i.e.  surface brightness ) can be estimated and the distance derived from the apparent brightness ( see e.g.@xcite ) . for gx3394  this is not possible , as even in a very low luminosity state , no spectral features of the companion star were seen in vlt / fors observations @xcite .",
    "this is frustrating for distance and parameter estimation , and very puzzling in its own right .",
    "one explanation for the non - detection of the companion is that the distance has been significantly underestimated .",
    "current distance estimates are very uncertain ; @xcite has provided a convenient summary .",
    "early estimates were rather low , mostly falling in the 14kpc range .",
    "more recently , larger estimates have been proposed .",
    "the non - detection of the companion star @xcite was used as evidence for a distance @xmath4kpc .",
    "a more novel approach was taken by @xcite who has shown that in most black hole binaries , transitions between the high / soft and low / hard states occur at approximately a fixed fraction of the eddington limit . it was suggested that the transition luminosity can then be used as a mass - dependent standard candle . assuming a minimum black hole mass for gx3394  of @xmath5m@xmath6 @xcite , @xcite estimate a distance @xmath7kpc , allowing for scatter about the relation .",
    "the actual distance of gx3394  thus remains very uncertain , but could be rather large .",
    "this introduces considerable uncertainty into interpreting its quiescent and outburst luminosities , and the nature of the companion .",
    "the distance also has important implications for interpretation of the recently discovered resolved jets ; @xcite estimated that the motion of the jet head requires an apparent velocity of 0.9c even at 4kpc .",
    "a significantly larger distance would therefore imply apparent superluminal motion .",
    "we have therefore analyzed interstellar features in high resolution spectra described in section  [ observationsection ] to elucidate the properties of the line - of - sight in more detail . in section  [ modelsection ]",
    "we perform a detailed study of the properties of line - of - sight nai  and caii  absorption , resolving most individual clouds in nai  and hence determining cloud - by - cloud velocities , velocity dispersions , and nai  column densities .",
    "we also have some information about the relative abundances of caii  to naias a function of velocity .",
    "we discuss the implications for the distance of gx3394  in section  [ rotationsection ] , and for the reddening in section  [ reddeningsection ] .",
    "finally in section  [ discussionsection ] we consider how the range of distances proposed affect estimates of the outburst and quiescent x - ray luminosities and the nature of the companion star , and in section  [ conclusionsection ] we summarize our conclusions .",
    "high - resolution observations of gx3394  were obtained with the uv - visual echelle spectrograph ( uves ) on ut2 ( kueyen ) at the vlt on 2002 august 915 .",
    "these spanned a wavelength range of 41006200  and included a total exposure time of 12hr yielding a superb quality average spectrum ( signal - to - noise ratio near the na  d  lines greater than 100 without binning ) .",
    "a 1  slit was used giving a nominal resolution near the na  d  lines of @xmath8 , corresponding to a kinematic resolution of 6.8kms@xmath0 .",
    "the starlight will be concentrated to the center of the slit , however , yielding a somewhat higher resolution . from the spatial profiles near na  d  we estimate a mean seeing of about 0.5  , implying that the resolution could be as good as 4kms@xmath0 with a 1  slit . in practice , this will not be realized and we expect a value between these extremes . we therefore leave the instrumental resolution as a free parameter in subsequent fits . for the rest of this work",
    "we will focus only upon the na  d1 and d2 lines ( 5895.92  and 5889.95  respectively ) .",
    "pipeline optimal extractions were supplied and were of good quality in this region ; a manual reduction of selected spectra yielded negligible improvement .",
    "we supplement these data with lower - resolution observations of the caii  h and k lines ( 3968.47  and 3933.66  respectively ) .",
    "these were obtained with the rgo spectrograph of the anglo - australian telescope over 2002 june 611 , with the r1200b grating yielding a wavelength coverage of 35005250 .",
    "the images were de - biased and flat - fielded , and the spectra subsequently extracted using conventional optimal extraction techniques @xcite .",
    "wavelength calibrations were interpolated between cuar comparison lamp images , obtained every 2030mins .",
    "the kinematic resolution is estimated to be 74kms@xmath0 .",
    "we show line profiles of the two na  d  lines in fig .",
    "[ nadfig ] relative to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) .",
    "they are clearly complex with a large velocity dispersion , suggesting a relatively large distance .",
    "this immediately rules out suggestions that gx3394  is a local object at @xmath9kpc ( @xcite ; @xcite ) ; the same conclusion was drawn by @xcite for different reasons .",
    "we can obtain an approximate estimate of the distribution of naiwith velocity by converting the line profiles into apparent optical depths ( fig .",
    "[ nadtaufig ] ) , as discussed by @xcite .",
    "this is not the true optical depth , because it is modified by instrumental broadening .",
    "it is also reduced ( relative to the naicolumn density ) for strongly saturated components .",
    "this is seen in differences in the optical depths inferred from the d1 and d2 lines . we have scaled - up the d1 optical depths in fig .",
    "[ nadtaufig ] by a factor of two ( the ratio of oscillator strengths ) so that the two lines can be directly compared . where the two optical depth profiles overlay ( i.e.  the d1 line has exactly half the optical depth of the d2 line ) the apparent optical depths are simply blurred versions of the true optical depth , and the relative contributions of different components are preserved . where unresolved saturated structure is present , the d2 line becomes preferentially more saturated , the d1 line becomes proportionately stronger , and the ratio of apparent optical depths approaches unity . in this case the total absorption of a component",
    "is underestimated , but the d1 optical depths reflect the column densities more accurately .",
    "we can see that most of the absorption column appears to be at low velocities , @xmath10kms@xmath0 , especially when one considers that these are the most saturated components , and hence the most severely underestimated .",
    "there is also a significant contribution at higher velocities , however .",
    "we can perform a more quantitative analysis by modeling the line profiles , and explicitly accounting for unresolved saturation .",
    "we follow standard techniques ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) , as also applied by @xcite to caii  lines in xte  j1118 + 480 .",
    "we assume that the line - of - sight absorption consists of a number of discrete clouds , each of which has mean velocity @xmath11 , a gaussian distribution of velocities with width @xmath12 , and nai  column density @xmath13 .",
    "given this model we can simultaneously predict both d1 and d2 intrinsic line profiles .",
    "we then convolve these with the instrumental resolution and compare with the data . as discussed above",
    ", the exact instrumental resolution is uncertain and was fitted as a free parameter .",
    "the best fit was obtained for 6.0kms@xmath0 , which falls within the range expected given the slit width and seeing ( section  [ observationsection ] ) .",
    "note that in most cases these parameters are relatively well constrained , even though the intrinsic widths are not fully resolved .",
    "this is because the differential saturation of the d1 and d2 lines makes the ratio of the two line strengths sensitive to the intrinsic widths .",
    "hence we can recover a reasonable estimate of the column density even for somewhat saturated lines .",
    "the largest uncertainty exists where significant saturation is present , and then we sometimes only constrain a lower limit upon the column density .",
    "fitting was performed iteratively using the levenberg - marquardt algorithm ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "we began by fitting the components labeled in fig .",
    "[ nadfig ] .",
    "additional components were added when it was clear that they were needed ; for example d clearly includes an additional low velocity component and a weak component is also needed between g and h. other deficiencies were apparent only by comparison with the preliminary fits and lead us to add additional components near c and f as well .",
    "it may be that such weak components from small clouds are actually present throughout the profile , but are only discernible in the gaps between the larger components ( redfield priv.comm . )",
    "the derived parameters for the components are listed in table  [ optfittable ] .",
    "this model reproduced the data extremely well , with no significant residuals , so we have not shown the fit .",
    "velocities are derived from both d1 and d2 lines simultaneously , and indicate a range of mean cloud velocities of 143 to + 32kms@xmath0 .",
    "we will compare this to galactic rotation curves in section  [ rotationsection ] .",
    "component widths are 1.57.3kms@xmath0 .",
    "these values are typical of the ism ; @xcite found average values for the na  d  lines of 4.0kms@xmath0 .",
    "if the lowest widths are purely thermal , they indicate cloud temperatures of @xmath14k , but turbulent broadening could be present as well . it may be that some of the larger widths , such as for component b , indicate additional unresolved components rather than intrinsically high widths .",
    "one of these mechanisms is needed for the highest widths , as these are too high for thermal broadening alone .",
    "we derive a total nai  column density of at least @xmath15@xmath16 , of which components b and c ( assumed to be relatively local ) contribute at least 63% .",
    "lccc component & @xmath11 & @xmath12 & @xmath13 + & ( kms@xmath0 ) & ( kms@xmath0 ) & ( @xmath17@xmath16 ) +   + a1 & @xmath18 & @xmath19 & @xmath20 + a2 & @xmath21 & @xmath22 & @xmath23 + b & @xmath24 & @xmath25 & @xmath26 + c1 & @xmath27 & @xmath28 & @xmath29 + c2 & @xmath30 & @xmath31 & @xmath32 + d1 & @xmath33 & @xmath34 & @xmath35 + d2 & @xmath36 & @xmath37 & @xmath38 + e & @xmath39 & @xmath40 & @xmath41 + f1 & @xmath42 & @xmath43 & @xmath44 + f2 & @xmath45 & @xmath46 & @xmath47 + g & @xmath48 & @xmath49 & @xmath50 + h1 & @xmath51 & @xmath52 & @xmath53 + h2 & @xmath54 & @xmath55 & @xmath56 + j & @xmath57 & @xmath58 & @xmath59 +   + b1 & @xmath60 & @xmath61 & @xmath62 + b2 & @xmath63 & @xmath64 & @xmath65 + c1 & @xmath66 & @xmath67 & @xmath68 + c2 & @xmath69 & @xmath70 & @xmath71 +    in most cases the sensitivity to unresolved blends is weak as the components are not strongly saturated and the total column density is approximately conserved . for component",
    "b , however , the total column density is sensitive to assumed substructure . to illustrate this , we repeated the fitting with two sub - components ; the results are shown in table  [ optfittable ] .",
    "this allows the main component to be narrower , and hence saturate more easily . a much larger column density is then required to achieve the same equivalent width of absorption .",
    "consequently , the single component fit should be considered the lower limit on the column density in the bc complex ( @xmath72@xmath16 ) .",
    "this implies that the total column density estimated above , and the fraction of total column contained within the bc complex , are also lower limits .",
    "similar difficulties exist for components c1 and h1 , and large column densities can not be formally rejected in either case .",
    "this reflects the significant saturation also present in these components ( fig .",
    "[ nadtaufig ] ) .",
    "the resolution of the aat observations of the caii  lines is not sufficient to perform a similar component - by - component analysis .",
    "we can , however , use the model derived from the na  d  lines to predict the lower - resolution profiles and perform a crude comparison . to do this",
    "we initially assume a ratio of caii  to nai  column densities of 0.6 , appropriate for inner galactic center sight - lines @xcite , and an instrumental resolution of 74kms@xmath0 .",
    "the intrinsic width of each component is scaled down by 0.76 , which is appropriate if it is dominated by thermal broadening ( i.e.  scaling by the square root of the atomic weight ) .",
    "the fit to the profile of the k line is shown in fig .",
    "[ caiifig ] ; the h line is not used because it is blended with balmer emission , but the line profile otherwise appears to be similar .",
    "the abundance ratio assumed clearly underestimates the caii  absorption at higher velocities . to improve the fit , we recalculated assuming a small velocity offset ( 5kms@xmath0 ; a small fraction of a resolution element ) for the aat spectra , a slightly lower ratio of caii  to nai  of 0.53 for most components , but a higher ratio of 4.5 for components g  j .",
    "if we alternatively keep the intrinsic width , @xmath12 , fixed ( appropriate for turbulent broadening ) then we require abundance ratios of 0.42 and 2.5 for low and high velocity components respectively .",
    "either model provides a much better fit , although clearly still underestimates the wings of the caii  profiles .",
    "this is a common feature ; additional caii  absorption is often seen at high velocities ( beyond those allowed by galactic rotation ) where nai  absorption is weak or absent @xcite .",
    "it has been attributed to a significantly enhanced abundance of gas - phase calcium ( by a factor of 50 or more relative to sodium ) in the high velocity components of the ism via collisional destruction of dust grains .",
    "it is also observed that the mean calcium abundance is enhanced along halo sight lines @xcite , although this may simply reflect the preponderance of high velocity material at high latitudes .",
    "other than such diagnostics , the nai  lines are more useful , as they are more closely related to galactic rotation , and correlate better with @xmath73 .",
    "we have mapped out the properties of gas clouds along the line - of - sight to gx3394  in velocity space .",
    "we now attempt to associate these with distance , assuming the velocity is due to galactic rotation , and hence derive a lower - limit on the distance to gx3394 .",
    "qualitatively we expect to see low - velocity material from the solar neighborhood , and increasingly negative velocities as the tangent point is approached . beyond this , velocities become less negative again , and become positive at distances outside the solar circle .",
    "the preponderance of absorption components with negative velocities is thus as expected from galactic rotation along this sight line . to be more quantitative ,",
    "we show the expected velocity as a function of distance in fig .",
    "[ rotcurvefig ] .",
    "we assumed the rotation curve prescription of @xcite , with the modified polynomial coefficients of @xcite .",
    "these were derived for a solar galactocentric radius of @xmath74kpc and velocity of @xmath75kms@xmath0 , consistent with the most recent geometric determination of the distance to the galactic center ( @xmath76kpc , @xmath77kms@xmath0 ; @xcite ) .",
    "[ rotcurvefig ] also indicates the velocity and relative column density of each fitted absorption component for easy comparison with the predicted velocities .",
    "components b and c in gx3394  likely correspond to local material , and contribute @xmath78%  of the total nai  column density .",
    "the velocities correspond to a distance @xmath79kpc , but the material could be within 1kpc allowing for a 10kms@xmath0 dispersion in mean velocities . for",
    "a galactic latitude of @xmath80 , this material will thus be @xmath81kpc below the plane and well within the nai  layer ( which has an estimated scale height @xmath82kpc ; @xcite ) .",
    "examination of field stars near gx3394 , at distances up to 2kpc , suggests that local material within this distance accounts for @xmath83 of the reddening to gx3394 , consistent with this @xcite .",
    "if the distance to gx3394  were @xmath84kpc , as proposed by @xcite and @xcite , then the maximum expected negative velocity would be @xmath85kms@xmath0 .",
    "components d and e could be co - rotating , but the g ",
    "j complex would require peculiar velocities of 4080kms@xmath0 .",
    "the latter accounts for @xmath86%  of the total column density , and as we have already noted is relatively overabundant in caii .",
    "there are two possible interpretations for this high velocity absorption .",
    "we consider the most likely to be that it is co - rotating with the galactic rotation curve . in support of this , the similarity of the velocities of the g ",
    "j complex to the predicted tangent point velocity of approximately @xmath87kms@xmath0 is suggestive .",
    "the range of velocities is also in very good agreement with co maps , which exhibit a vertically integrated range of velocities to @xmath88kms@xmath0 for this galactic longitude @xcite .",
    "the inferred altitude of the tangent point material , is @xmath89kpc .",
    "this is not a serious problem given a scale height of 0.43kpc .",
    "the alternative explanation is that the g ",
    "j complex ( and component f ) arises from closer material with large peculiar velocities ; the same material as the ` forbidden velocity ' gas of @xcite .",
    "the enhanced caii  abundance would be typical of such gas .",
    "we believe that the presence of multiple components contributing a significant fraction of the nai  column at such high velocities is very unlikely , however .",
    "such features are not seen in nai  in any of the similar lines of sight collected by @xcite , and @xcite estimated that even the velocity dispersion of the _ high velocity _",
    "caii  absorption components was only @xmath90kms@xmath0 . if gx3394lies at 4kpc it would therefore have a rather unusual line - of - sight .",
    "neither are such extreme velocities seen in any of the spectra of local stars presented by @xcite .",
    "consequently , it seems more likely that most of the absorption velocities do indicate galactic rotation and that gx3394  lies at or beyond the tangent point .",
    "the implied distance is then @xmath91kpc , allowing for some uncertainty in rotation curves and the intrinsic velocity dispersion of the absorbing clouds .    beyond this",
    ", the situation is less clear .",
    "this is because the velocities increase again , and so there is ambiguity between close and distant material .",
    "components d  f could arise on either side of the tangent point , and it is hard to make a conclusive statement about how far beyond this gx3394  could lie . two lines of argument suggest a significantly larger distance is possible , but neither are conclusive .",
    "one is the systemic velocity of gx3394  itself .",
    "the best estimate of this comes from the emission line radial velocity analysis of the same dataset used here @xcite , with heii  emission line wings suggesting @xmath92kms@xmath0 , and bowen lines consistent with this for the preferred orbital period .",
    "this would of course be expected for a local object , but the na  d  velocity dispersion rules this out , even if earlier arguments do not . if gx3394lies at the tangent point , however , then the peculiar radial velocity would be @xmath93kms@xmath0 .",
    "this is unusually large for a black hole binary , as @xcite estimated that their radial velocity dispersion should be 40kms@xmath0 , based on their distances from the plane and consistent with measurements .",
    "larger values are not impossible ( e.g.  gro  j165540 has an estimated peculiar radial velocity of 114kms@xmath0 ; @xcite ) , but are thought to arise when black holes are formed by fallback onto a neutron star which received a kick @xcite . a large velocity is only expected for a low - mass black hole , however , which is inconsistent with the high mass function of gx3394  and lack of evidence for a high inclination . further increasing the distance is therefore appealing as it would reduce this required peculiar velocity .",
    "a location close to the solar circle on the far side of the galaxy ( @xmath94kpc ) would require negligible peculiar velocity , consistent with most galactic black hole binaries .",
    "the other argument comes from the one absorption feature we have not yet accounted for : component a. this has two sub - components with _ positive _ velocity , 2535kms@xmath0 .",
    "if this arises locally then it arises from material with a forbidden velocity @xmath95kms@xmath0 .",
    "given that there are only two weak components ( or one with a complex profile ) , and that the total contribution to the column density is @xmath96% , this is not impossible .",
    "this material could also arise on the far side of the galaxy , and would then have a radial velocity close to that of the source .",
    "one could argue that since gx3394  has a galactic latitude of @xmath80 , at this distance , the line - of - sight should be more than 1kpc below the plane .",
    "however the galaxy does exhibit warps , and the outer disk warps downward toward the line - of - sight of gx3394@xcite .",
    "it is possible that gx3394 , and the red - shifted absorption , are associated with this warped material .",
    "we thus conclude that a minimum distance of 6kpc is required , based on the presence of intervening material with large blue - shifts , consistent with expected tangent point velocities .",
    "the presence of red - shifted absorption , together with the low systemic velocity of gx3394  itself , suggest that a much larger distance @xmath94kpc might be correct , although a large peculiar velocity for gx3394 , together with forbidden velocity gas could obviate this . gx3394  is thus further away than most previous estimates ( but see @xcite and @xcite ) , and possibly a lot further .",
    "our high quality spectra should also allow us to obtain more robust reddening constraints from the na  d  lines ; we do not attempt this with the caiilines as these do not trace the dust as well @xcite .",
    "the integrated na  d  equivalent width ( ew ) has been estimated by a number of authors .",
    "the most recent values are 3.7@xcite and @xmath97  @xcite .",
    "we estimate a total ew of @xmath98  from our resolved na  dlines , with @xmath99  and @xmath100  in the na  d1 and d2 lines respectively , consistent with other estimates .",
    "the uncertainties quoted are conservative estimates based on the range of possible continuum levels ; formal statistical errors are smaller than this .",
    "the interpretation of the equivalent width is obviously complicated by saturation of some components , but neglecting this we recover a lower - limit of @xmath101 from the na  d2 line assuming the asymptotic linear calibration of @xcite .",
    "we can perform an analogous calculation using the less saturated na  d1 line , since in the optically thin limit the d2/d1 ratio has a value of 2 .",
    "this yields a lower limit of @xmath102 .",
    "an alternative approach is to circumvent the saturation effects by using the column density derived from the line profile fits . as with all such calibrations , it is still sensitive to assumptions about gas - to - dust scaling ratios .",
    "we use the values derived by @xcite , which include scalings for a number of types of sight line .",
    "an nai  column of at least @xmath15@xmath16 corresponds to @xmath103@xmath16 and @xmath104 using ratios appropriate to inner galactic center sight lines .",
    "these values change to @xmath105@xmath16 and @xmath106 using galactic center ratios , and @xmath107@xmath16 and @xmath108 for averaged ratios .",
    "the uncertainty is larger than implied by the scatter between these estimates , however , since the variance in ratios within each of these samples is large .",
    "while some of the variance may simply reflect measurement errors , it is likely that the ratios are subject to significant cloud - to - cloud scatter .",
    "as discussed earlier , these are also lower limits , since the local components of na  d  are saturated and the column density used here may have been significantly underestimated .",
    "this is likely why both the @xmath109 and @xmath73 values we estimate are lower than other measurements ( e.g.@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , even with the detailed resolution presented here , we can not determine a reliable @xmath73 from the na  d  lines ; this method is fundamentally rather crude , and limited by saturation .",
    "all we can say with confidence is that the reddening is greater than 0.5 , and probably greater than about 0.8 .",
    "this is comparable to previous estimates including @xmath110 @xcite and @xmath111 @xcite .",
    "we suspect that these quoted uncertainties are underestimates , however , as similar difficulties apply as with our own measurements ; indeed the latter estimate is also based on na  d. upper limits are problematic , and neither the methods of @xcite , nor @xcite , nor our discussion above adequately address this .",
    "neutral hydrogen column densities do allow a crude upper limit , however .",
    "a range of values are derived ( see references above ) , but all imply @xmath112@xmath16 .",
    "similarly , a range of gas - to - dust scalings exist , but that of @xcite , with an assumed 30%  uncertainty , encompasses all of them , and also accounts for the variance between lines of sight .",
    "using this scaling and the upper limit on @xmath109 implies @xmath113",
    ". the actual value could well be much less than this .",
    "an independent check is provided by the galactic dust maps of @xcite which imply @xmath114 , although their use for galactic latitudes less than @xmath115 is not recommended by the authors .",
    "the luminosity of the transition between high / soft and low / hard states in black holes is of interest @xcite and it may even be an approximate standard candle . as already noted , @xcite estimated a minimum distance of 6kpc assuming the minimum black hole mass is given by the mass function of @xmath116m@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the true mass is likely to be significantly larger than this , however , as the mass function is only approached for high inclinations and there is no evidence that gx3394  has a high inclination ; indeed it has been argued that the inclination is very low @xcite . for actual black holes masses of 10 , 15 , or 20m@xmath6 , distances of about 10 , 12 , or 14kpc",
    "respectively would be expected based on the method of @xcite .",
    "these are very reasonable if gx3394  lies somewhat beyond the tangent point as we have argued . if it is really beyond 15kpc , however , then either the black hole mass is relatively high , or the transition luminosity is rather high ( but not implausibly so ) .",
    "@xcite have instead tried to use the maximum observed luminosity as a constraint on the distance .",
    "we can reverse the argument , however and examine the maximum luminosity for different possible distances . at 6kpc ,",
    "their quoted maximum observed luminosity corresponds to just 10%  of the eddington limit of a 10m@xmath6 black hole .",
    "this seems rather low , and a higher black hole mass would further exacerbate this .",
    "in contrast , for a distance of 15kpc and black hole masses of 1020m@xmath6 , the eddington ratio is 0.30.6 , which seems much more in line with other galactic black hole x - ray binaries .",
    "more recent observations provide more stringent constraints , yielding an 0.1200kev flux of @xmath117erg@xmath16s@xmath0 ( extrapolated from a 3100kev fit ; homan et al .  in preparation ) . for a 10m@xmath6 black hole at distances of 6 and 15kpc",
    "respectively this corresponds to 20%  or 110%  of the eddington limit .",
    "the latter could readily be reconciled with a black hole somewhat more massive than 10m@xmath6 .",
    "thus the luminosity is consistent with a relatively large distance given the implied high mass for the black hole .",
    "the x - ray luminosity in the lowest observed state @xcite corresponds to @xmath118ergs@xmath0 or @xmath119ergs@xmath0 for distances of 6 or 15kpc respectively .",
    "most quiescent black holes have luminosities of between @xmath120 and @xmath121ergs@xmath0 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the exception is v404  cyg ( @xmath122ergs@xmath0 ; @xcite ) .",
    "this is a long period object ( 6.5day ) and may be something of an anomaly among quiescent black holes ; indeed it exhibits dramatic x - ray variability ( @xcite ; @xcite ; hynes et al .  in preparation ) which suggests that it may not be in a fully quiescent state .",
    "gx3394  appears to have a comparable or larger luminosity at minimum light , so its lowest observed state may also not correspond to the typical quiescent states of transient black hole binaries .",
    "a relatively active system is appealing in the light of the non - detection of spectral features from the companion star @xcite .",
    "two explanations exist for this : either the accretion flow is so luminous that it masks the companion star , or the companion is an early - type star with no spectral features in the region studied by @xcite .",
    "as noted above , a relatively active accretion flow already favors a larger distance , and even 15kpc gives a plausible luminosity .",
    "if we require an early - type companion then its luminosity will be larger than for the typical k or m companions of galactic black holes , and so a large distance might also required to avoid it being visible .    with no detection of the photospheric lines of the companion ,",
    "its nature is poorly constrained .",
    "the companion star should be somewhat evolved , as a 1.7day orbital period @xcite implies a mean density for the companion of only 0.06g@xmath123 .",
    "this is a factor of ten below that obtained by @xcite who assumed a shorter orbital period .",
    "such a low density is reached on the main sequence only for b0 stars ; it is unlikely that the companion is such a star , however , as it would then be expected to dominate the total light at low luminosities , and also significantly affect the motion of the black hole .",
    "hence the companion of gx3394  has a lower density than a main - sequence star of the same temperature .",
    "it is probably a sub - giant , as late - type giants have even lower densities than we derive for gx3394 .    for relatively early types , the companion mass is also significant and should result in measurable orbital motion of the accretion disk",
    "@xcite found no such evidence ( only a weak modulation was present , with the wrong phase - dependence ) and suggested a mass ratio of @xmath124 .",
    "this argues for a companion mass of 1.6m@xmath6 or less unless the black hole mass is significantly larger than in other objects ( @xmath125m@xmath6 ) and hence a spectral type of f or later unless the companion is hotter than a main sequence star of the same mass .",
    "in support of these arguments , groj165540 has a comparable orbital period ( 2.6d ) , and an f companion ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "its mass ratio is @xmath126 @xcite , however , the disk lines move with an amplitude of @xmath127kms@xmath0 @xcite , and the companion totally dominates the optical light in quiescence and remains visible even during outburst .",
    "these properties are very different to gx3394 , which evidently has a much less influential companion .",
    "g or k subgiants therefore seem more likely than earlier types .    at our proposed distances",
    "there is little difficulty in accommodating such companions .",
    "we consider a number of examples . for each we adopt the main sequence mass corresponding to the spectral type , but adjust the radius to fill the roche lobe .",
    "the size of the lobe is constrained by the 1.7day orbital period , an assumed black hole mass between 5.8 and 20m@xmath6 , and a mass ratio less than 0.1 .",
    "the reddening is assumed to be between 0.8 and 1.6 , as discussed above .",
    "the upper limit is more pertinent , as it makes it easier to hide luminous companions .",
    "an f0 star ( adopted mass 1.6m@xmath6 ) could only be accommodated if the black hole mass were near 20m@xmath6 ; otherwise we would expect detectable motion of the accretion disk . at 6kpc",
    "such a star should have an @xmath128 magnitude of 17.019.5 , dependent on reddening .",
    "this is brighter than the observed faintest magnitude ( @xmath129 ; @xcite ) , so is unlikely unless the companion is significantly less massive ( and hence has a smaller roche lobe ) . at 15kpc , however , this could be as faint at @xmath130 , so could be masked by the accretion light . for a g0 star ( assuming @xmath131m@xmath6 )",
    ", we expect a range of 18.120.6 at 6kpc , or 20.122.6 at 15kpc , and either distance is acceptable , provided the reddening is relatively large .",
    "a k0 star ( @xmath132m@xmath6 ) yields @xmath133 at 6kpc and 21.124.7 at 15kpc and poses no difficulties .",
    "these estimates are rather crude and dependent on some assumptions , but are probably still useful as approximations .",
    "to summarize , the companion to gx3394  is likely to be a sub - giant , of spectral type g or later if close , @xmath1kpc , or possibly f if the distance is much larger .",
    "we have analyzed nai  and caii  absorption along the line of sight to gx3394 .",
    "we find a rich absorption spectrum with a large velocity dispersion .",
    "velocities are predominantly blue - shifted and span the range of velocities expected for galactic rotation along this line - of - sight .",
    "the presence of multiple features with a significant column density near the tangent point velocity suggests that gx3394  is either at or beyond the tangent point , i.e.  @xmath134kpc .",
    "the presence of absorption at red - shifted velocities , together with the systemic velocity of gx3394  itself , suggest the possibility that the object could be at an even greater distance , on the far - side of the galaxy , @xmath135kpc .",
    "neither of these pieces of evidence are as secure as that for a location beyond the tangent point , however .",
    "our analysis also indicates a total nai  column density along the line of sight of at least @xmath15@xmath16 , and this suggests a reddening of at least @xmath136 , depending on assumed ratios of nai  to dust densities .",
    "this is consistent with more straightforward calibrations of the equivalent widths , which imply @xmath137 , but it could be considerably larger dependent on the degree of saturation . hence even with well resolved observations of the na  d  lines it is impossible to derive a precise reddening from these lines and published estimates should be viewed with caution .",
    "we have examined the implied outburst and quiescent luminosities , and the nature of the companion , in the context of these proposed scenarios .",
    "neither a distance of 6kpc , nor 15kpc , presents difficulties in these respects .",
    "in fact the larger distance simplifies matters somewhat , for example in explaining the non - detection of the companion ( likely a late - type sub - giant ) in quiescence .",
    "consequently we propose that a large distance , @xmath3kpc , should be given consideration .",
