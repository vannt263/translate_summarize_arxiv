    "in this paper we study the set of periods of continuous maps from the space @xmath0 to itself , where the space @xmath0 consists of a circle with a segment attached to it at one of the segment s endpoints .",
    "our results continue the progression of results which began with sharkovskii s theorem on the characterization of the sets of periods of periodic points of continuous interval maps @xcite and continued with the study of the periods of maps of the circle @xcite , trees @xcite and other graphs @xcite .",
    "a full characterization of the sets of periods for continuous self maps of the graph @xmath0 having the branching fixed is given in @xcite .",
    "our goal is to extend this result to the general case .",
    "the most natural approach is to follow the strategy used in the circle case which consists in dividing the problem according to the degree of the map @xcite .",
    "the cases considered for the circle are degree different from @xmath6 , and separately the cases of degree @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath1 .",
    "a characterization of the set of periods of the class of continuous maps from the space @xmath0 to itself with degree different from @xmath9 can be found in @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we aim at studying the set of periods of continuous @xmath0-maps of degree 1 .",
    "following again the strategy of the circle case , we shall work in the covering space and we shall use rotation theory .",
    "this theory for graphs with a single circuit was developed in @xcite ; the current paper is thus an application of the theory developed there .",
    "we shall follow three main directions in studying the set of periods of @xmath0-maps .",
    "the first very natural one follows from the trivial observation that the space @xmath0 contains both a circle and a subset homeomorphic to a @xmath5 ( also called a @xmath4-star ) .",
    "it is quite obvious that there exist @xmath0-maps of degree @xmath1 whose set of periods is equal to the set of periods of any given degree @xmath1 circle map , as well as the set of periods of any given @xmath4-star map .",
    "we shall show that there exist @xmath0-maps @xmath3 whose set of periods is any combination of both kinds of sets , provided that @xmath7 is an endpoint of the rotation interval of @xmath3 : the whole rotation interval gives a set of periods as for circle maps whereas the set of periods of a given @xmath4-star map appears with rotation number @xmath7 .",
    "the second direction is the study of periodic orbits that do not intersect the circuit of the space @xmath0 ; this study is necessary because the rotation interval does not capture well the behaviors of such orbits .",
    "we shall show that the existence of such a periodic orbit of period @xmath10 implies all periods less than @xmath10 for the sharkovsky ordering ; this is quite natural because this ordering rules the sets of periods of interval maps and the branch of @xmath0 is an interval .",
    "moreover , we shall show that if , in the covering space , there exists a periodic orbit living in the branches and with diameter greater than or equal to @xmath1 , then the set of periods contains necessarily all integers .",
    "the third direction focuses on the rotation number @xmath7 . for degree @xmath1 circle maps ,",
    "the strategy is to characterize the set of periods for a given rotation number @xmath11 in the interior of the rotation interval , which comes down to do the same for the rotation number @xmath7 for another map .",
    "unfortunately , mimicking this strategy fails for @xmath0-maps because the set of periods of rotation number @xmath7 can be complicated and we do not know how to describe it .",
    "however , we shall characterize the set of periods ( of any rotation number ) when @xmath7 in the interior of the rotation interval of a @xmath0 map : in this case , the set of periods is , either @xmath12 , or @xmath13 , or @xmath14 .",
    "moreover , we shall stress some difficulties that appear when one tries to follow the same strategy as for degree @xmath1 circle maps .    in the next section ,",
    "we state and discuss the main results of the paper , after introducing the necessary notation to formulate them .",
    "as it has been said , in this paper we want to study the set of periods of the @xmath0-maps . given a map ,",
    "we say that a point @xmath15 is _ periodic of period @xmath10 _ if @xmath16 and @xmath17 for all @xmath18 .",
    "moreover , for every @xmath15 , the set @xmath19 is called the _ orbit of @xmath20_. observe that if @xmath20 is periodic with period @xmath10 , then we have @xmath21 ( where @xmath22 denotes the cardinality of a finite set ) .",
    "the set of periods of all periodic points of @xmath3 will be denoted by @xmath23 .    following the strategy of the circle it is advisable to work in the covering space and we shall use the rotation theory developed in @xcite .",
    "we also shall consider periodic @xmath24 points and orbits for liftings instead of the true ones defined above .",
    "the results obtained in this setting can be obviously pushed down to the original map and space .",
    "we start by introducing the framework to use the rotation theory developed in @xcite .",
    "we consider the universal covering of @xmath0 .",
    "more precisely , we take the following realization of the covering space ( see figure  [ figs ] ) : @xmath25 where @xmath26\\}}},\\ ] ] and @xmath27 and @xmath28 denote respectively the real and imaginary part of a complex number @xmath29 . the set @xmath30 is called the _ set of branches of @xmath31_.

    "the set of all periods of the periodic @xmath24 points of @xmath67 will be denoted by @xmath77 .",
    "wen talking about periodic points and periodic @xmath24 points we shall sometimes write _ true period _ or _ true periodic point _ to emphasize that they are not @xmath24 .",

    "clearly , for every @xmath82 , @xmath83 is a well defined continuous self map of @xmath0 .",
    "reciprocally , for every continuous map @xmath3 from @xmath0 into itself , there exists a lifting @xmath84 such that @xmath85 , and this lifting is unique up to an integer ( that is , if @xmath86 is another lifting , there exists @xmath87 such that @xmath88 ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath89 and @xmath29 is a periodic @xmath24 point of @xmath58 of period @xmath10 if and only if @xmath90 is a true periodic point of @xmath91 of ( true ) period @xmath92 consequently , @xmath93 and _ characterizing the sets of periods @xmath24 of maps from @xmath94 is equivalent to characterizing the sets of periods of continuous self maps of @xmath0_.    this paper will deal with maps of degree @xmath1 , for which rotation numbers can be defined .",
    "next we recall the notion of rotation number in our setting and its basic properties .",
    "let @xmath64 and @xmath68 .",
    "we define the _ rotation number of @xmath29 _ as @xmath95 if the limit exists .",

    "the second property implies that , if @xmath58 , @xmath86 are two liftings of the same continuous map from @xmath0 into itself , then their rotation sets differ from an integer ( @xmath103 such that @xmath88 , and hence @xmath104 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the set @xmath105 may not be connected as it has been shown in @xcite .",

    "observe that the class of maps @xmath115 such that @xmath121 and @xmath122 for every @xmath123 can be identified with the class of liftings of continuous circle maps of degree @xmath1 .",

    "clearly , this includes the sets of periods of interval maps .",
    "moreover , it might happen that this phenomenon occurs for rotation numbers different from 0 , that is , there may exist a map from @xmath133 with set of periods @xmath134 , @xmath135 @xmath136 and @xmath137 such that @xmath138 and @xmath139 therefore , a natural conjecture for the structure of the set of periods of maps from @xmath124 could be that it is the union of the set of periods of a circle map of degree @xmath1 with some sets of the form @xmath140 with @xmath141 and @xmath142 much in the spirit of the characterization of the set of periods for circle maps of degree one .",

    "we are going to do this in the next two subsections ; we shall also introduce the necessary notations .",
    "a _ tree _ is a compact uniquely arcwise connected space which is a point or a union of a finite number of segments glued together at some of their endpoints ( by a _ segment _ we mean any space homeomorphic to @xmath143 $ ] ) .",
    "any continuous map @xmath3 from a tree into itself is called a _",

    "we say that @xmath3 is _ monotone _ if , either @xmath159 is reduced to one point , or @xmath159 is a non degenerate interval and , given any homeomorphisms [ i ] , [ f(i ) ] , the map is monotone .",

[ ex:2gluedstars - model ] given @xmath2011 , it is possible to build a map @xmath2012 with a true periodic orbit @xmath169 of period @xmath2013 such that the linear model of @xmath2014 lives in a tree consisting in a @xmath295-star glued to a @xmath378-star . to remain readable",

    "we choose points @xmath2018 and @xmath2019 as in figure  [ fig:2gluedstars ] .",
