    "the study of the formation and evolution of galaxies is a fundamental avenue of research in the process of understanding astrophysical and cosmological issues .",
    "how galaxies form and evolve can be studied using a variety of techniques , one of those being the galaxy luminosity function ( lf ) .",
    "the galaxy lf , assuming that galaxy mass - to - light ratios are nearly constant for similar types of galaxies , can potentially provide a direct link to the initial mass function and hence the distribution of density perturbations that are thought to give rise to galaxies @xcite .",
    "since most galaxies are not isolated entities , evolutionary processes , in addition to those expected for an aging stellar population , can occur as galaxies interact with their environment .",
    "the galaxy lf  the number of galaxies per unit volume in the luminosity interval @xmath8 to @xmath9  can be used as a diagnostic tool to search for changes in the galaxy population . in particular , the lf for cluster galaxies can help ascertain the influence of the cluster environment on the galaxy population .",
    "for example , a change in the shape of the lf with respect to cluster - centric radius provides important insight into the dynamical processes at work in the cluster environment .",
    "a central theme in the early studies of the galaxy cluster lf has been to determine whether the lf is universal in shape ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while introducing the modern form of the lf , the so - called `` schechter function '' , @xcite suggested that the cluster lf is universal in shape , and can be characterized with a turnover of @xmath10 and a faint - end slope of @xmath11 .",
    "further support for a universal lf has been provided by several studies such as @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "in contrast , several studies have shown that the shape of the cluster lf is not universal ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "one expects that the lf depends on cluster - centric radius since the mixture of galaxy morphological types should vary with radius , as implied by the morphology  density relation @xcite .",
    "since different morphological types are characterized by different lfs @xcite the cluster lf ( integrated over all galaxy types ) should not be universal . indeed ,",
    "some studies have provided evidence that the cluster lf does vary with cluster - centric radius ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the main goal of this paper is to investigate the change in the cluster @xmath12-band lf as a function of cluster - centric radius . to avoid the inherent bias that has plagued numerous studies ,",
    "the cluster lf will be compared based on scaling relative to the dynamical radius , @xmath0 .",
    "the use of a dynamical radius for comparing galaxy populations for a sample of clusters , provides one of the most robust , least - biased , photometric survey yet published on the lf of abell clusters . directly comparing lfs that sample only the cluster core region with other cluster lfs that extend to the outskirts , will suffer from radial sampling bias given that the shape of the lf has been shown to depend on cluster - centric radius ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "a direct comparison of the galaxy population with respect to cluster - centric radius based on @xmath0 , will help to accurately measure the change in the properties of cluster galaxies as a function of global environment .",
    "these data will also provide information to help settle the long - standing debate regarding the universality of the cluster galaxy lf and the properties of the faint dwarf galaxy component .",
    "this paper is the third in a series resulting from a multi - color imaging survey of low - redshift ( @xmath13 ) abell clusters .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we present a brief overview of the sample selection and data reduction procedure . in ",
    "3 we describe the methodology for generating the galaxy cluster lf . in  4 we examine the lf for different color - selected galaxy populations of our cluster sample .",
    "discussion and conclusions are presented in  5 .",

    "recent observations suggest that the best cosmological model is characterized by @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the clusters for this sample were selected using the previous criteria except that @xmath24 clusters were not preferentially excluded .",
    "in addition , two clusters imaged in @xmath25 and @xmath12 are included from @xcite using the same instrumental setup as the locos sample and selection criteria as the mosaic data .",
    "all clusters in the sample are detected in x - rays and are found to have a prominent cmr @xcite .",
    "the integration times for our 57-cluster sample varies from 250 to 9900 s , depending on the filter and the redshift of the cluster ( only the @xmath25- and @xmath12-band data are considered here ) .",
    "control fields are also an integral part of this survey . for this study",
    "we use a total of six control fields in both the @xmath25 and @xmath12 filters .",
    "the control fields were chosen at random positions on the sky at least @xmath32 away from the clusters in our sample .",
    "these control fields were observed using the mosaic camera to a comparable depth and reduced in the same manner as the cluster data .",
    "all observations included in this study were carried out during 1992 - 1993 and 1996 - 1998 .",
    "processing of the 8k mosaic images were done using the mscred package within the iraf environment .",
    "the photometric reduction was carried out using the program ppp ( picture processing package ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which includes algorithms for performing automatic object finding , star / galaxy classification , and total magnitude determination . a series of improvements to ppp described in @xcite that decreases the detection of false objects and allows star / galaxy classification in images with a variable point - spread - function ( psf ) was utilized .",
    "the object list for each cluster is compiled from the @xmath12 frames .",
    "the @xmath12 frames are chosen because they are deeper than the images from the other filters .",

    "an optimal aperture size for each object is determined based on the shape of the curve - of - growth using criteria described in @xcite .",
    "the photometry of galaxies near the cluster core was carried out after the cd and bright early - type galaxies had been removed using profile - modeling techniques developed by @xcite .",
    "galaxy colors were determined using fixed apertures of @xmath37 on the images of each filter at the redshift of the cluster , sampling identical regions of galaxies in different filters , while imposing a minimum color aperture of @xmath38 times the full - width - half - maximum ( fwhm ) in order to avoid seeing effects ( average seeing @xmath39 ) .",
    "the overall internal accuracy in the color determinations is @xmath40 mag in @xmath41 for bright objects .",
    "the errors for faint objects can be as large as 0.5 mag in @xmath41 .",
    "we note that the total magnitude of a galaxy is determined using the growth curve from the @xmath12 image , while the total magnitude in the @xmath25 image is determined using the color difference with respect to the @xmath12 image ( for more details , see * ? ? ?",
    "star / galaxy classification was performed within ppp using a classifier that is based on the comparison of the growth curve of a given object to that of a reference psf .",
    "the reference psf is generated as the average of the growth curves of high signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) , non - saturated stars within the frame .",

    ", up to 45 standard stars can be accommodated in a single frame .",
    "the color properties of the standard stars cover a large color range that encompasses those of elliptical and spiral galaxies .",
    "the standard stars are measured using a fixed aperture of 30 pixels for the locos frames and 32 pixels for the mosaic data .",
    "these aperture sizes are selected as being the most stable after measuring the magnitudes using a series of diameters .",
    "we adopt the average extinction coefficients for kpno and fit for the zero points and color terms .",
    "the rms in the residuals of individual fittings is in the range @xmath42 mag , which is comparable to the night - to - night scatter in the zero points .",
    "this can be considered as the systematic calibration uncertainty of the data .",
    "the final galaxy catalogs were generated using the information and corrections derived previously .",
    "for data obtained under non - photometric conditions , single cluster images were obtained during photometric nights in order to calibrate the photometry ( three clusters in total ) .",
    "the completeness limit for each field is based on a fiducial @xmath43 limit determined by calculating the magnitude of a stellar object with a brightness equivalent to having a @xmath44 in an aperture of @xmath45 .",
    "this is done by scaling a bright unsaturated star in the field to the @xmath43 level .",
    "since the @xmath43 limit is fainter than the peak of the galaxy count curve , and hence below the @xmath46 completeness limit for galaxies , a conservative @xmath46 completeness limit is in general reached at @xmath47 mag brighter than the @xmath43 detection .",
    "see @xcite for a detailed discussion of the completeness limit relative to the @xmath43 detection limit .",
    "galaxy colors and magnitudes were corrected for the extinction produced by our galaxy .",
    "the values of the galactic extinction coefficients were calculated from the @xcite maps using the reported @xmath48 values , or directly from the @xmath49 tabulations for bright galaxies @xcite with coordinates in the vicinity of our pointed observations using ned .",

    "the schechter function is fit to the cluster galaxy counts following the procedure in @xcite . in summary ,",
    "the function parameters @xmath7 , @xmath58 , and @xmath2 are estimated by performing a @xmath59 minimization of the form @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the net galaxy counts in the @xmath62 bin of the observed lf , @xmath63 is the expected number of counts in the @xmath62 bin of width @xmath64 , and @xmath65 is the uncertainty of the counts in the @xmath62 data bin .",
    "the expected number of counts in the @xmath62 bin , corrected for the loss of information due to the finite bin size , is given by @xcite @xmath66 where the derivative is with respect to absolute magnitude , and @xmath64 is the bin width .",

    "for a single schechter function fit , @xmath58 is fixed so that the total number of observed galaxies in the data set is equal to the number predicted by the schechter function .",
    "the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath2 are obtained by minimizing equation 3 using the levenberg - marquardt method @xcite .",
    "the @xmath12-band lf is constructed statistically by subtracting a background galaxy population from the cluster galaxy counts .",
    "this method , in contrast to measuring the redshift of individual galaxies in the cluster field , relies on an accurate determination of the background field population .",
    "this statistical approach has been used in numerous studies to date ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the modal field - to - field variation per magnitude bin has been measured to be @xmath72 above poisson statistics among the six background fields .",
    "we use this value to approximately account for the additional uncertainty in the background counts due to field - to - field variations in equation 5 .",
    "although the use of galaxy redshifts would provide a more robust determination of the cluster lf , the relatively modest variation of the background counts , with respect to the cluster counts , makes the statistically derived cluster lf valid .",
    "a similar conclusion has also been reached by a number of independent studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "several studies have examined the effect on the derived cluster lf using a global background galaxy field correction versus one measured locally for each cluster ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for example , @xcite has shown for a study of 69 clusters based on sdss dr2 data , that there is no significant difference in the measured cluster lf using either a global or local background subtraction technique .",
    "contamination from the 2-d projection on the sky of a distant cluster in the field - of - view of the target cluster can prove to be problematic by skewing the lf , especially at the faint - end where galaxies from the background cluster directly add to the desired lf .",
    "fortunately , the cmr can help minimize this contamination by identifying the early - type red sequence of the target cluster @xcite .",
    "the effect of background clusters on the desired lf can thus be reduced by selecting an appropriate color cut , thus eliminating objects redder than the cluster red sequence .",
    "this method can also help to locate foreground clusters which , given the low redshift of our cluster sample , are not a significant concern for this study .    to minimize contamination from background galaxies , we cull galaxies that are 0.22 mag redward of the cmr ( i.e. , @xmath73 times the average @xmath74 dispersion of the cluster red sequence ) .",
    "the dispersion of the cluster red sequences are tabulated in table 1 of @xcite and histogram representations of the rectified @xmath41 color distributions are presented in paper i ( see also figure 1 from * ? ? ?",
    "in several cases ( e.g. , a2152 ) , a color cut @xmath75 is used if a second red sequence from a more distant cluster ( and hence at a redder @xmath41 ) is apparent in the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of the target cluster . for faint magnitudes ,",
    "we cull galaxies redder than @xmath76 if 2.5 times the average uncertainty in the galaxy @xmath74 is redder than 3.0 times the dispersion of the cluster red sequence .",
    "k - corrections are applied using a single parametrization based on early - type galaxies , which dominant the cluster galaxy population @xcite . at the low redshift of our sample ,",
    "the difference between early- and late - type galaxies is minimal for the @xmath12-band . in general , the maximum k - correction applied was @xmath77 mag .",
    "the k - correction adopted for each cluster is tabulated in paper i. all lfs presented in this paper have been extinction- and k - corrected , and no attempt has been made to correct for individual internal galaxy absorption .",
    "studies of the properties of galaxy clusters , such as the cmr and lf , have been routinely compared on a cluster - by - cluster basis .",
    "nearly all of these studies define a `` cluster '' based on the total area covered by the telescope detector ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or by using a specific physical length ( e.g. , @xmath78 mpc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the large variation in cluster richness @xcite inhibits the usefulness of the above techniques for robustly comparing cluster properties .",
    "some authors have attempted to `` normalize '' clusters by directly comparing only clusters of comparable class ( e.g. , bautz - morgan type ) or by weighting each cluster according to richness @xcite .",
    "the use of a variety of different methods have certainly contributed to conflicting results that have emerged from past investigations regarding measurements such as the universality of the lf @xcite .    as a means of computing a `` dynamical '' radius within which cluster characteristics can be robustly compared ,",
    "the @xmath0 radius was calculated for each cluster .",
    "the @xmath0 radius marks the size of a cluster within which the average density is 200 times the critical density , and follows from the definition used in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 radius is expected to contain the bulk of the virialized mass of a cluster ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and is used in this study as a scaling factor to compare cluster features .",
    "the use of this type of `` normalization '' allows us to compare galaxy cluster populations in a less biased fashion , especially those properties which are a function of cluster richness and cluster - centric radius .",
    "this approach has recently been implemented by @xcite and @xcite to study the properties of a sample of clusters / groups from the sdss .",
    "the procedure for determining @xmath0 involves the calculation of the velocity dispersion , which requires redshift measurements for a number of cluster galaxies .",
    "the data available for this study do not include redshift information for cluster members , thus an alternative method was employed to estimate @xmath0 for each cluster .",
    "this method relies on the correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath0 as measured for the cnoc1 sample @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 parameter is a measure of the cluster - center galaxy correlation amplitude , and has been shown to be a robust estimator of cluster richness @xcite .",
    "the measured values of @xmath1 for our cluster sample are calculated using the method outlined in @xcite .",
    "figure  [ bgc - r200 ] depicts the relationship between @xmath0 and @xmath1 for 15 clusters from the cnoc1 survey @xcite , adopted from @xcite .",
    "we note that the @xmath0 vs. @xmath1 figure in yee & ellingson ( see their figure 5 ) used the less well - determined @xmath79 from ( * ? ? ?",

    "this explains the decrease in the scatter of @xmath0 vs. @xmath1 for our figure  [ bgc - r200 ] compared to the corresponding figure in yee & ellingson .",

    "the rms scatter in the derived values of @xmath0 is on the order of 15% .",
    "the fit was performed using the bisector bivariate correlated errors and intrinsic scatter ( bces ) estimator @xcite since this algorithm accounts for uncertainties in both variables .",
    "the cluster ms 1455 + 22 ( open circle in figure  [ bgc - r200 ] ) was excluded from the fit since it is @xmath82 from the expected relation ( see yee & ellingson 2003 for a detailed discussion of ms 1455 + 22 ) .",

    "the second criterion helps insure that faint red sequence galaxies near the completeness limit are selected , even though they will be scattered further from the cmr than the limit imposed by criterion 1 due to the increased uncertainty in the measured color . as stated in the second criterion , only galaxies redward of the cmr were chosen .",
    "this was implemented to minimize the inclusion of galaxies blueward of the red sequence ( what we refer to as the `` blue '' galaxy population ) , which are scattered into the red sequence region due to the color uncertainty at faint magnitudes . to compensate for the `` missing '' members of the red galaxy population that are located blueward of the red sequence ,",
    "the net galaxy counts for those galaxies fainter than the magnitude at which objects are culled based on criterion 2 , have been increased by a factor of two , since in the absence of a blue galaxy population one might expect the red sequence members to be symmetrically distributed on either side of the cmr .",

    "the dependence of the shape of the lf on cluster - centric radius provides strong evidence that the relative mixture of giant and dwarf galaxies depends on the fraction of the virial radius that is measured .",

    "figure  [ comparelf ] illustrates that the slope of the lfs are very similar at bright magnitudes where the giant galaxies have the greatest influence on the shape of the lf .",
    "the main difference in the slope arises at the faint - end where the influence of the dwarf galaxies tends to increase the steepness of @xmath2 .",
    "the sampling depth and effective cluster - centric radius thus has a major influence on the measured shape of the cluster lf since the inclusion of different amounts of the dwarf galaxy population will directly impact the faint - end slope .",

    "in addition , we measure a dispersion of 0.3 mag in the value of @xmath7 for the depicted cluster lfs ; the faintest value is @xmath264 for the inner - most annuli from this study and the brightest is @xmath265 from @xcite .",
    "as discussed in  4.3.2 , figure  [ mstar - radius ] shows that the bright - end @xmath7 becomes brighter with increasing cluster - centric radius for both the red , and with a lesser significance , the blue cluster galaxies .",
    "the observed dimming of @xmath7 toward the cluster center can be explained as a simple fading of the galaxy population . for the blue cluster galaxies , the truncation of star formation as field galaxies fall into the cluster environment ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) would lead to a fading of @xmath7 with decreasing cluster - centric radius . since clusters are believed to have formed via the infall of galaxies along filamentary - like structures ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is expected that a population of infalling field galaxies can be detected in addition to the older , mainly early - type red galaxies .",
    "if star formation for infalling spiral galaxies , which dominate the field galaxy population ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is truncated via some type of dynamical mechanism ( e.g. , ram pressure stripping , galaxy harassment , etc . ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "given enough time , infalling spiral galaxies may acquire characteristics that are similar to s0 galaxies .",
    "in fact , this type of mechanism for s0 formation has been proposed by numerous authors ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , although the formation of field s0s has remained problematic for these models .",
    "the dimming of @xmath266 , or the decrease of ( @xmath267 ) for the faint - end of the red sequence lf for decreasing cluster - centric radii , places constraints on the evolutionary path of the faint blue galaxies .",
    "if these galaxies simply fade and turn red , we would expect them to contribute to the red sequence lf by increasing the number of faint red galaxies in the central cluster region .",
    "we thus suggest that the faint blue cluster galaxies are destroyed in the central cluster region .",
    "this is not a far - fetched hypothesis since the faint blue galaxies are very similar to the low - mass dwarf spheroidal galaxies , which are expected to undergo tidal disruption in the central cluster environment @xcite .",

    "we will explore this possibility further in paper iv of this series .    the fading of the bright - end @xmath7 for the red sequence galaxy population may be the result of two separate processes ; the continuous fading of infalling red galaxies ( which may have turned red relatively recently due to the truncation of star formation ) and galactic cannibalism in the high - density central cluster region . for the infall scenario ,",
    "red galaxies are expected to originate from a population that had arrived in the cluster environment early in its history .",
    "the observed dispersion of the cmr for the cluster red sequence places constraints both on the formation timescale of the early - type galaxy population and any episodes of recent star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "red galaxies which have entered the cluster environment during the earliest part of the cluster lifetime , would be expected to be the faintest since the time between the last phase of major star formation and today would be the greatest for these galaxies ( after the truncation of star formation , galaxies would evolve passively with an associated reddening and dimming of their starlight ) . under this scenario",
    ", we would expect that the blue galaxy population would show a greater rate - of - change in @xmath7 with radius due to the more recent decline in the star formation rate .",
    "the red galaxies would be expected to exhibit a more gradual change in @xmath7 , as compared to the blue galaxy population , since the red galaxies are just a passively evolving old galaxy population .    as depicted in figure  [ mstar - radius ]",
    "the bright - end @xmath7 for the red sequence galaxies fades more rapidly toward the cluster center than for the blue galaxy population .",
    "since a simple infall scenario as described predicts that the blue galaxy population should exhibit the more rapid decline in @xmath7 , we hypothesize that an additional mechanism may affect the rate - of - change of @xmath7 with radius for the red galaxy population .",
    "a clue to this additional effect is gleamed from figure  [ mstar - bgc - bm ] where the correlation between @xmath7 and bm - type is depicted for the total cluster sample .",
    "as described in  4.3.1 , the trend for a brightening of @xmath7 with later bm - type can be explained by galactic cannibalism . as first theorized by @xcite and @xcite , as bright galaxies fall into the cluster center",
    "they will be swallowed by the giant central galaxy , thus resulting in the fading of @xmath7 as bright galaxies are depleted from the lf . since early bm - type clusters have , by definition , a bright central dominant galaxy ,",
    "the correlation depicted in figure  [ mstar - radius ] is expected .",
    "galactic cannibalism will also result in the fading of @xmath7 with decreasing cluster - centric radius , as illustrated in figure  [ mstar - radius ] .",
    "we performed a simple test of this hypothesis by calculating @xmath7 for our red cluster galaxy sample for early bm - type clusters ( i and i - ii ) and late bm - type clusters ( ii , ii - iii , and iii ) .",
    "we assume that the effect of galactic cannibalism on the radial dependence of @xmath7 will be greatest for the early bm - type sample . comparing @xmath7 between the inner- and outer - most radial bin",

    "this bias is a result of scattering in @xmath41 and @xmath12 of galaxies due to photometric uncertainties . to understand",
    "the extent of this effect , an artificial galaxy catalog for abell 260 was constructed by taking the original galaxy catalog and adding a small , random magnitude offset based on the measured @xmath12 magnitude and its uncertainty for each galaxy , assuming gaussian statistics . by tracking the relative offset in position on the cmd between the original cluster galaxies and their simulated counterparts ,",
    "the impact of the color bias can be measured .    in figure  [ colorbias ] a vector - type cmd for abell 260",
    "is presented for galaxies brighter than the cluster completeness limit ( @xmath290 ) .",
    "the vectors trace the scattering path of a galaxy from its initial position in the observed color - magnitude plane to its position in the artificial catalog . for bright galaxies ,",
    "the change in position is minimal compared to the size of the region from where the galaxies are selected ( see figures  [ redseq - region ] and [ blue - region ] for selection of red sequence and blue galaxies ) .",
    "the largest displacement in the color - magnitude plane occurs for the faint red galaxies where the relatively large uncertainties in @xmath41 produce a larger change in color .",
    "the magnitude of this displacement is not significant compared to the size of the regions used to select red and blue galaxies .",
    "this exercise justifies the method used to select faint red sequence galaxies ( see  4.2.2 , criterion 2 ) . by restricting the selection of faint red sequence galaxies from a region redward of the cmr ( see figure  [ redseq - region ] ) , the contamination from blue galaxies scattered into the red sequence region is minimized .",
    "as stated in section 3.4 , the value of @xmath0 determined from @xmath1 ( via equation 7 ) has an associated rms scatter of @xmath291 . to determine whether a 15% scatter in @xmath0 will have a significant influence on our conclusions ,",
    "a simulated composite lf was derived by randomly changing @xmath0 by @xmath292 .",
    "a comparison of the observed lf with the simulated lf is presented in figure  [ allr200 ] for the four cluster - centric radial bins used previously .",
    "inspection of figure  [ allr200 ] shows that the two lfs are equivalent for each radial bin depicted .",
    "thus , the 15% scatter in the value of @xmath0 is expected to have minimal impact on our results .",
    "this is at least in part due to the expected gradual change in the properties of the lf as a function of @xmath0 .      in  4.1",
    "it was noted that the bcg was not included in the construction of the cluster lf since they do not appear , statistically , to be a natural extension of the lf . in figure  [ compall - bcg ] the composite lf for the inner - most radial bin , @xmath92 ,",
    "is depicted for clusters ( complete to @xmath249 ) with and without the inclusion of the bcg . as this figure demonstrates ,",
    "the bcgs are not a simple extension of the schechter function , which may indicate that bcgs are formed by a different process ( e.g. , mergers , cannibalism , etc . ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) than the fainter cluster galaxy population .",
