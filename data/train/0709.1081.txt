    "<S> if the bare nucleus @xmath8 mg is deformed , the above analysis indicates that @xmath8 mg as a core in @xmath1al may have larger deformation as compared with @xmath8 mg as a nucleus . additionally , the first excited state of @xmath8 mg was calculated within the rmf framework and its @xmath76 is obtained to be around 2.4% larger than that of the ground state  @xcite . thus the core excitation effect may also contribute to the larger size for @xmath8 mg . as demonstrated by the shell model calculations , the configuration of @xmath8 mg ( ground state ) plus a @xmath10-wave proton is dominant in @xmath1al  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . if deformation and excitation effects exist in the core , the first one may be the main component .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> the longitudinal momentum distribution of fragments after one - proton removal for @xmath1al and reaction cross sections for @xmath3al were measured . </S>",
    "<S> an enhancement was observed for the @xmath2 of @xmath1al . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 distributions were found to be wide and consistent with the goldhaber model s prediction . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental @xmath0 and @xmath2 results were discussed within framework of the few - body glauber model . </S>",
    "<S> we determined the valence proton to be a dominant @xmath10-wave configuration in the ground state of @xmath1al . </S>",
    "<S> it indicates no halo structure in this nucleus . but </S>",
    "<S> a larger sized @xmath8 mg core was deduced in order to explain both the @xmath2 and @xmath0 distributions within framework of the spherical few - body glauber model . </S>",
    "<S> it is pointed out that deformation and core excitation effects may be two main reasons for the extracted larger sized core . </S>",
    "<S> further theoretical investigations are needed to extract more specific structure information for @xmath1al from the experimental data . </S>"
