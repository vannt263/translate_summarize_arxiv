    "the present main belt asteroid size distribution provides important constraints on models of the original size distribution of planetesimals and their collisional evolution .",
    "the size - frequency distribution , main belt asteroid scale height , and albedo variations extant in a large , well - sampled population are also essential to model the size distribution of the near earth asteroid ( nea ) population and to determine the evolution of main belt objects as compared to those bodies injected into earth crossing orbits ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "most main belt asteroids are found between 2.2 and 3.4 au from the sun and at ecliptic latitudes nominally less than 20 .",

    "while the infrared ( ir ) and optical methodologies yield comparable size estimates , these surveys are potentially biased as they are unable to detect ( either through intrinsic sensitivity limits or survey design ) fainter objects within the main belt .",
    "thus , the size - frequency distribution may not be complete due to the preferential selection of a cross section of the asteroid population with high albedo values or large sizes .",
    "@xcite have modeled the collisional evolution of the size distribution of the main belt using the current size - frequency distributions within the main belt as well as the size - frequency distribution of neas to constrain the primordial asteroid distribution .",
    "their best - fit models , based on the current size - frequency distribution , predict @xmath18 asteroids within the 0.3 to 1 km size range .",
    "collisional models by @xcite predict @xmath19 bodies in a similar size range within the main belt .",
    "however , the validity of the population extrapolation is based on an accurate understanding of the current size - frequency distribution necessitating deep observations to provide accurate number counts at both optical wavelengths ( higher albedo objects ) and ir ( larger dark asteroids ) wavelengths .",
    "the collisional evolution model by @xcite suggests that the primordial main belt contained @xmath20 to 250 times the current population of objects with diameters , @xmath21  km .",
    "the @xcite model produces a parent population of similar magnitude to that required by interpretation of the meteoritic record .",
    "for instance @xcite argues that the surface density within the main belt must be at least 100 times higher than that currently observed to be consistent with the meteoritic record .",
    "the total mass of known asteroids in the main belt is @xmath22 .",
    "however , both the meteoritic record and collisional models require a primordial main belt mass of @xmath23 to @xmath24 .",
    "the significant discrepancy between the mass of the primordial main belt and the current mass , primarily derived from large ( @xmath25  km ) sized asteroids , may be resolved by extending the asteroid number census to properly encompass smaller sizes while including populations found at higher ecliptic latitudes .    here",

    ", an asteroid must be detected in at least 2 of the 3 epochs of data .    in our optical data ,",
    "the 85@xmath70 moving target completeness limit in all fields is @xmath3 . because the moving target completeness samples the completeness due to ( 1 ) a limiting flux and ( 2 ) motion , a point source completeness test was also performed .",
    "this exercise shows that the point source completeness at @xmath3 is 90@xmath70 .",
    "for all asteroids counts at magnitudes greater than 21.3 , the difference in the two completeness values of 5@xmath70 , is applied by assuming that the number of asteroids not detected due to motion is the same at all magnitudes .",

    "figure  [ fig : lbt_histdist_4panel_fig1a ] shows the number counts per square degree as a function of magnitude in each optical field .",
    "the _ spitzer _ irac  8.0  analysis , under the constraints that the synthetic asteroid rate of motion was comparable to the median rates of motion in a field at a given ecliptic latitude combined with the requirement of a minimum of 2 detections per synthetic asteroid yields an 80@xmath70 completeness limit for the fls and swire data for @xmath71  @xmath37jy .",
    "our derived completeness value differs somewhat from that reported for the fls by @xcite who cite 90@xmath70 completeness at 100  @xmath37jy based on fixed target detections . with the completeness limit at 103  @xmath37jy",

    "other variables in the equation for thermal flux are : @xmath91 is the asteroid-_spitzer _ separation ( au ) , @xmath92 is the asteroid emissivity which is assumed to be 0.9 , a is the bond albedo , @xmath93 is the solar constant , @xmath94 is the asteroid heliocentric distance in au , and @xmath95 is the beaming parameter . adopting mean values for the known asteroids in our datasets @xmath96  au , @xmath97  au ( optical ) and @xmath98  au , @xmath99  au , ( _ spitzer _ asteroids ; table  [ table : stmres ] ) , assuming @xmath100 with @xmath101 and @xmath102 , the minimum asteroid radii detected in our data are @xmath103  m in the optical and @xmath104  m in the irac 8.0  channel . although _ spitzer _ is far more efficient than optical imaging surveys at detecting smaller asteroids , asteroids identified from these two data sets comprise a set of bodies with similar size ranges within the main belt .",

    ", we use the completeness corrected counts to measure the power law slopes summarized in table  [ table : oir - slopes ] .",
    "the derived optical and ir slopes are similar at all latitudes within the uncertainties , with a mean value of @xmath107 for the surface density distribution of asteroids . however , the formal errors suggest that the optical data provides a better constraint on @xmath108 .",
    "our derived @xmath108-values ( table  [ table : oir - slopes ] ) for the _ spitzer _ fields differs somewhat from those cited by @xcite .",
    "the differences can be attributed to how the asteroid photometry was conducted ; @xcite employed psf - fitting ( using , at that time , a poorly determined irac psf ) , whereas we resort to aperture photometry to measure the flux density .",
    "in addition , differences in completeness also lead to variances in our results as opposed to those presented in @xcite .",
    "we cite 80% completeness at 100  @xmath37jys for moving - objects , while @xcite quote 90% completeness at the same flux level for point sources .",
    "as the derived slopes of the surface density distributions are similar at optical wavelengths , we employed a kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test using the mean rates of motion of the asteroids at @xmath16 and @xmath109 ecliptic latitude to discriminate whether these bodies detected in the optical fields are drawn from the same size and magnitude population distributions . unlike a @xmath110 test",
    ", data is not binned in the ks test and the ks test can be used on data sets of different lengths . due to the low number of asteroids detected in the 10@xmath111 and 15@xmath111 , binning of the data",
    "was rejected due to the associated loss of information and arbitrariness of defining bin sizes .",
    "the derived probability is 96.88% , strongly suggesting that the two fields represent the same distance ( rate ) population .",
    "similarly , a ks test to determine the likelihood that the asteroids represent the same size distribution yields only a 41.32% probability that the objects at @xmath109 represent the same size distribution as those detected at @xmath16 ecliptic latitude .",
    "this statistical inference suggests that the size distribution of asteroids at @xmath16 and @xmath109 are dissimilar ; however , the veracity of this conclusion is limited by small number detection statistics of our data . table  [ table : ks - mmm ] summarizes our probability analysis of the magnitude distribution ( e.g. , asteroid diameters ) as a function of ecliptic latitude compared to the @xmath16 field .",
    "lastly , although the ks test indicates that the @xmath16 and @xmath109 optical fields are likely not the same population , they do appear to follow a distribution in which large , thus bright , objects are rare , whereas small and thus faint , objects are more numerous .",
    "our observed asteroid frequency distribution can be juxtaposed with current models describing the evolution of the asteroid populations in the solar system , such as the statistical asteroid model ( sam ) developed by @xcite .",
    "the sam uses a set of 8603 asteroids with absolute magnitudes less than 15.75 ( asteroids with diameters of @xmath112 2.5 km ) to determine a size - frequency distribution of asteroids which is assumed to be smooth to diameters of 1 km .",
    "this model also incorporates an albedo distribution derived from 15 dynamical families and 3 `` background '' populations based on 1980 asteroids which have diameter and albedo determinations from msx @xcite and iras @xcite .",
    "a number of asteroids are excluded from this model , including those with inclinations greater than @xmath113 , those with eccentricities @xmath114 0.3 .",
    "the asteroid number counts observed with both _ spitzer _ and the lbt are less than those predicted by the sam . for a limiting flux of 0.06  mjy at 8",
    "the sam predicts @xmath115 asteroids at @xmath16 latitude and @xmath116 asteroids at @xmath69 latitude .",
    "one reason the sam may overestimate the number of asteroids is the assumed faint flux limit of @xcite which corresponds to an effective diameter of 0.6  km .",
    "this flux limit is fainter than the completeness for both fields , thus the sam over predicts the number of small asteroids which would be observed by _ spitzer_. the overestimate of the number of asteroids may also be due to a fundamental assumption of the sam  the power law slope of the size - frequency distribution is continuous to diameters less than 1  km .",
    "this is not observed in the optical . the size - frequency distribution appears to fall off around 3  km @xcite ; however , the reasons for this fall off are not well understood .",
    "two possible reasons for the fall off in observed data are : 1 )  the bright limiting magnitude of most asteroid surveys excludes detections of asteroids smaller than 1  km in diameter , or 2 )  the asteroids smaller than 1  km may not be solid , but may instead be easily disruptible piles of rubble . if the predicted number of asteroids is scaled from the sam with a model that yields the number of asteroids with diameters @xmath114 0.6  km being 2.4 times the number of asteroids with diameters @xmath114 1.0  km , the sam still predicts @xmath117 asteroids in the @xmath16 latitude field and @xmath118 asteroids in the @xmath69 latitude field . the estimate at the high latitude is nearly in agreement with our fls results ; however , the sam still overestimates the number of asteroids in the @xmath16 field .",
    "the latter discrepancy may due to asteroids with high albedos ( @xmath114 0.25 ) which are not detected in the irac channels because they are too cool and thus their thermal fluxes are below the detection thresholds in this data .    for the lbt data which has limiting diameters of @xmath32 2  km , the number counts are within the uncertainty of the sam prediction . for the sdss survey which has a point source completeness limit of @xmath119 ,",
    "the sam predicts @xmath120 asteroids at @xmath16 latitude and @xmath121 asteroids at @xmath69 latitude .",
    "this completeness limit is fainter than ours by 0.9  mag ; however , the model values are nearly in agreement with the asteroid number counts at these two latitudes .",
    "unfortunately , the sam does not predict asteroid counts at higher latitudes ( @xmath122 ) and the current version of the sam only uses asteroids with inclinations less than @xmath123 to make estimates on number counts .",
    "a subset of our newly detected asteroids have large inclinations .",
    "in fact this limitation of the sam complicates derivation of the size - frequency distribution and physical characteristics of well known and well characterized targets such as pallas and asteroid dynamical groups such as hungarias and phocaeas @xcite",
    ".      direct comparison of mean and median irac 8.0  fluxes (  [ saf ] ) of asteroids in the two fls fields and the swire field , reveals that the swire asteroids are , on average across the population , brighter than those asteroids at @xmath16 and @xmath69 latitude detected in the fls fields , by a factor of two .",
    "this variance in brightness could be explained as a difference in asteroid diameter assuming that the populations have comparable albedos .",
    "we explored this possibility by estimating the diameters and deriving albedos for all asteroids which were detected in all four irac bands using the near earth asteroid thermal model ( neatm ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this model ,",
    "the thermal flux is dependent upon the sub - solar temperature and the temperature distribution of the surface of the asteroid .",
    "the latter is solely dependent on the albedo and @xmath95 as model variables .",
    "thus , our implementation of neatm follows the @xcite and @xcite prescription whereby the model fits the ir fluxes and the optical absolute magnitude of asteroids ( @xmath124 ) by varying the geometric albedo ( through a @xmath110-minimization ) until a best fit is found .",
    "the _ spitzer _",
    "fluxes were first color - corrected according to the prescription described in the irac data handbook @xcite , resulting in the measured fluxes being divided by 1.1717 and 1.1215 at 5.8  and 8.0  , respectively .",
    "the asteroid diameter is then calculated by the relation of @xcite which uses only the geometric albedo and the absolute magnitude as input values .",
    "because irac asteroid spectral energy distributions are composites of both thermal emission and reflected solar light ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we derived albedo and diameter estimates of the asteroids using only data from irac channels 3 and 4 . from the channel 3 and 4",
    "fits , we find that the percentage of reflected solar light in our channel 1 photometry to be @xmath46 56% and @xmath46 14% in the channel 2 photometry .",
    "our modeling results for _ known _ asteroids detected in our irac fields are summarized in table  [ table : stmres ] .",
    "the mean diameters of asteroids in swire is 5.91  km while the mean asteroid diameter in the fls is 2.28  km .",
    "analysis of the mean geometric albedos and derived sizes for these objects suggests they divide between the two populations .",
    "the mean geometric albedo for asteroids in the fls fields is @xmath125 as opposed to @xmath126 for asteroids in the swire fields .",
    "no low albedo asteroids ( @xmath9 @xmath10 0.1 ) were detected in the _ spitzer _ fls fields , whereas in the swire fields they are frequent .",
    "evidently the surface composition of the asteroids in the swire fields contains more carbonaceous material than the asteroids in the fls , as carbonaceous chondrites have significantly lower albedos in the 0.03 to 0.11 range @xcite .    however , the marked dichotomy in derived albedos is most likely a result of the two _ spitzer _ surveys sampling different asteroid taxonomy classes within the general asteroid belt .",
    "an extensive analysis of @xmath127 objects in the sloan digital sky survey moving object catalog ( sdss moc ) 4 by @xcite demonstrates that there is a strong correlation between sdss color , asteroid taxonomy ( c- , s- , v - type ) , and orbital elements . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sdssmoc4_fig3 ] we plot the proper orbital elements @xmath128 ( orbital semi - major axis ) vs. @xmath129 ( orbital inclination ) of our swire ( green squares ) and fls ( red triangles ) detected asteroids overlaid on 207,942 numbered asteroids ( black dots ) with orbital elements in the astorb files @xcite .",
    "the location of the major kirkwood gaps as defined by @xcite are indicated , and the colored symbols used to identify the _ spitzer_-detected asteroids are coded by derived albedo .",
    "open symbols are for _ spitzer _ asteroids with derived albedos , @xmath130 , while filled symbols identify asteroids with @xmath131 .",
    "the majority ( @xmath132% ) of the low albedo asteroids detected in the _ spitzer _ data reside at high inclination in the outer belt .",
    "primitive asteroids , with c - type colors and generally low albedos ( @xmath133 ) , are seen to dominate the asteroid population in the outer belt , while s - type asteroids with @xmath9 ranging from @xmath134 to 0.2 tend to be more dominant in the middle and inner asteroid belt @xcite .",
    "our swire data clearly samples asteroids in the middle and outer belts , and in fact , for the first time , we are able to estimate the albedos of km - sized asteroids in the outer belt ( table  [ table : stmres ] ) .",
    "the low albedos ( @xmath130 ) of the @xmath135  km - sized outer belt swire asteroids are similar to the albedos derived for jupiter - family comets , @xmath136 @xcite .",
    "recent modeling by @xcite investigating the capture likelihood of cometary planetesimals into the asteroid belt ( leading the establishment of a d - type population ) suggests that the inner edge of the d - type population is near @xmath137  au . whether the population of low albedo asteroids discovered in our swire fields discussed here are organic - rich , primitive objects can only be verified with follow - up spectroscopy .    from flux measurements in all 4 irac channels",
    ", we can also begin to constrain the colors of asteroids .",
    "this is beneficial for both the understanding of bulk asteroid albedo variations as a function of size and other orbital parameters such as orbital semi - major axis or inclination and for the future exclusion of asteroids from galactic or extragalactic catalogs .",
    "figure  [ fig : color_fig4 ] is an adaptation of the work by @xcite which shows the irac colors of fixed astronomical objects where we have now included asteroid color data derived from the our fls and swire field photometry .",
    "asteroids mainly reside in one isolated locus in color space .",
    "the size of this locus is dependent upon both temperature and albedo .",
    "the shortest wavelength observations with irac at 3.6  trace the fraction of reflected incident solar flux , thus traces albedo , while the 8.0   to 4.5  ratio traces the thermal emission and thus the albedo and distance of an asteroid .",
    "our combined optical survey of @xmath138 square degrees and _ spitzer _ irac  8.0   fields encompassing from 0.26 to @xmath139 square degrees of sky at five latitudes perpendicular to the ecliptic plane resulted in detection of 118 main belt asteroids , of which 91 are newly identified objects either at optical or infrared wavelengths .",
    "the optical and mid - ir asteroid counts and fluxes demonstrate that the slope of the size - frequency distribution is consistent with that of a similar size population at 0@xmath111 and 15@xmath111 ecliptic latitude .",
    "the derived power law slopes of the asteroid surface density distribution are similar at within each @xmath5 ecliptic latitude bin with a mean slope of @xmath140 .",
    "the observed asteroid number densities at optical wavelengths are generally consistent with those derived from the standard asteroid model within the ecliptic plane .",
    "however , we find an over density at @xmath11 in our optical fields , while the infrared number densities are under dense by factors of 2 to 3 at all ecliptic latitudes .    for the 28 known asteroids detected in all four irac channels , mean albedos range from @xmath7 to @xmath8 , statistically suggesting that these are two different populations .",

    "the errors in the slope of the size - frequency distribution can not be decreased by greater number statistics alone .",
