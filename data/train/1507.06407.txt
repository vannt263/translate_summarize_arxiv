    "green s function ( gf ) is widely used in the study of quantum many - body problems in condensed matter physics.@xcite it is not only a common language to describe the fundamental physical concepts and processes , but also an important tool to do quantitative calculations for physical observables . among all the methods of calculating a gf , expanding it into the power series of certain parameter",
    "@xmath0 is a basic and straightforward method for the hamiltonian @xmath5 , provided that @xmath2 is exactly solvable and its gf obtainable . in cases where no other reliable results are available for gf , such a series expansion ( se )",
    "provides a reference which is accurate in the limit of small @xmath0 . besides quantitative information , important qualitative understanding of the system",
    "can also be obtained by analysing the properties of gf series .",
    "well - known examples are the fermi liquid properties of weakly interacting fermions@xcite and the simplification of theory for lattice fermions in the large spatial dimension limit.@xcite    various gf series expansion methods have been developed so far . for a weakly interacting system , the weak - coupling expansion applies , where the non - interacting part of the hamiltonian is chosen as @xmath2 and @xmath3 is the interaction part . using wick s theorem , interacting gf is expanded in terms of the interacting vertex and free gf .",
    "standard feynman diagram techniques facilitate the representation and calculation of the series .",
    "various partial summation methods have been developed diagrammatically , including hartree - fock , random phase approximation , and fluctuation - exchange approximation.@xcite    in the other limit where the interaction is strong , the strong - coupling expansion can be considered , if the interacting part of hamiltonian is exactly solvable . in this case ,",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath3 denote the interacting part and the non - interacting part of a given hamiltonian , respectively .",
    "although the conventional wick s theorem no longer holds , various diagram techniques have been developed .",
    "wick - like theorems were established@xcite for the standard basis operators@xcite ( an extension of the hubbard operators@xcite ) to develop diagrammatic expansions for gf .",
    "a more convenient way is the cumulant expansion method@xcite introduced by metzner .",
    "he expands the gf in terms of the hopping lines and local cumulants@xcite with unrestricted summations . in another elegant approach , the strong - coupling problem of original fermions",
    "is transformed into an effective weak - coupling problem of the dual fermions through a grassmann hubbard - stratonovich transformation.@xcite the gf of the dual fermions and of the original fermions are then obtained from standard feynmann diagram technique.@xcite in both the weak- and the strong - coupling expansion approaches , it is necessary to sum partial contributions in the series to infinite order with a resummation method to restore the analytical structure of gf.@xcite if done correctly , such resummation can significantly extend the validity range of the theory .    in recent years , monte carlo ( mc ) sampling methods have been used to carry out the series expansion of gfs , either in the form of determinant calculation@xcite or the direct diagram summations.@xcite in these methods , usually a large number of expansion terms can be sampled and summed to give the gf which is reliable in broad parameter regimes .    in this work ,",

    "first , it is universal in the sense that the formalism does not depend on the concrete form of @xmath2 . for any hamiltonian @xmath2",
    "whose eigen states and eigen energies , or gf can be obtained exactly , one can always expand the full gf in terms of @xmath3 in a recursive fashion .",

    "single particle as well as many - particle gfs with two time variables can be obtained in the same general formalism .",
    "third , the expansion calculation only involves double time gfs of @xmath2 .",
    "the complicated multiple - time integrations in traditional expansion method are replaced with operator commutator calculations here .",
    "fourth , in the present framework , the issue of partial infinite summation and the zero temperature divergence problem in the unrenormalized series expansion can be dealt with by a standard procedure , i.e. , by using the continued fraction resummation and the self - consistent expansion scheme .",
    "fifth , eom of the residue of a finite order expansion is given , providing a possible means to estimate the error of the truncated series and to improve the expansion result .    in this paper",
    ", we carry out the eom expansion of single particle gf for the anderson impurity model .",
    "both the weak - coupling expansion to @xmath9 order and the strong - coupling expansion to @xmath10 order are obtained for single particle gf . in this work",
    ", we put the emphasis on the strong - coupling expansion . by comparing the obtained local density of states ( ldos ) with that from the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) method",
    ", we evaluate the effect of the bare eom expansion and the self - consistent eom expansion , supplemented with different resummation methods .",
    "we show that the self - consistent eom expansion together with the continued fraction resummation gives qualitatively correct results which are improved in several aspects over previous ones .",

    "iv , several issues about the method are discussed and a summary is given .",

    "the target of expansion is the gf defined in eq.([eq:1 ] ) with only two time variables .",
    "we focus on the equilibrium state where the gf depends only on @xmath20 , although the method can be generalized to the non - equilibrium case . in the equilibrium state",

    "will be generated .",
    "usually this heirarchical eom can not close automatically and approximate truncations have to be introduced to form a closed set of algebraic equations . in this way , gfs will be expressed explicitly in terms of @xmath28 and some unknown averages .",
    "finally , these averages will be calculated self - consistently from gfs through the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , @xmath29 being flexible and non - perturbative , the above eom formalism has been widely used in the study of quantum many - body systems since the early works of bogoliubov,@xcite anderson,@xcite hubbard@xcite and others .",
    "the applications range from kondo physics@xcite to quantum magnetism.@xcite however , due to the lack of a universal and systematic truncation scheme , it is difficult to control the precision of the resulting gfs . especially , the analytical structure of gf may be violated by the truncation .",
    "usually , well established truncation schemes are obtained empirically and only apply to specific problems . here",
    ", we will employ the eom formalism to obtain a systematic series expansion for the double time gfs .",

    "the corresponding super - operator @xmath32 , defined as @xmath33 $ ] , has certain symmetries and hence has finite dimensional invariant subspaces even in the thermodynamical limit .",

    "can still be solved exactly if every eigen - state @xmath35 and eigen energy @xmath36 of @xmath2 can be obtained , @xmath37 . in such cases",
    "one can construct the standard basis operators ( sbos)@xcite @xmath38 .",
    "any operator in the hilbert space of @xmath2 can be expanded by sbos as @xmath39 here @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the eom of gfs defined by sbos @xmath42 naturally close and give @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 is the partition function of @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath34 is then obtained as @xmath46 .",
    "now suppose that the full hamiltonian is a sum of an exactly solvable part @xmath2 and a perturbation @xmath3 .",
    "we add a bookmarking factor @xmath0 to @xmath3 and the hamiltonian reads @xmath47 .",
    "we will expand @xmath8 into a power series of @xmath0 and set @xmath0 as unity afterwards .",

    ", @xmath68 can be expressed in terms of the lower order gf @xmath71 with more complicated operators @xmath72 . repeatedly employing eq.([eq:9 ] ) , one can then reduce @xmath71 to @xmath73 , and so on .",
    "finally the gf component of every order @xmath57 can be reduced to the type @xmath74 with different operators @xmath6 .",
    "these zeroth order gfs are exactly solvable .",
    "therefore , eq.([eq:9 ] ) provides a practical way of calculating arbitrary order contributions to @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath55-th order residue of the expansion @xmath61 is determined by its eom eq.([eq:11 ] ) which can not be solved exactly . by truncating the hierarchical eom eq.([eq:11 ] ) , one could obtain an approximate result for @xmath61 .",

    "the set of equations is both consistent and sufficient .",
    "that is , a unique solution of the averages at @xmath63-th order is always obtainable .",
    "the @xmath55-th order residue of the average @xmath75_{\\pm } \\rangle^{r}_n $ ] needs to be calculated self - consistently using eq.([eq:13 ] ) .",
    "truncating the taylor series of a gf at a finite order always produces the problem of causality .",
    "this is most easily demonstrated by taylor expanding the lehmann representation of @xmath8 ( taking the fermion - type gf as an example ) @xmath76 here @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the eigen state and the eigen energy of @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "@xmath79 is the partition function , and @xmath80 is the matrix element .",

    ", we have shown that in general , @xmath81 factors will appear in @xmath68 ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "the cf resummation procedure transmits these @xmath81 factors into the parameters @xmath119 and @xmath117 , leading to an unphysical shifting of certain poles to infinity as @xmath124 approaches zero .",

    "the validity range of the cf - resummed gf is thus limited to temperatures higher than some energy scale . for the hubbard model",

    "generally speaking , this problem reflects that the ground state energy or the density matrix is not expanded on the same footing as the excitation energies . inspecting the lehmann representation of se shows that this problem also exists in the se resummation .    in the bare expansion formalism eq.([eq:9 ] ) , the only place where @xmath127 emerges is the component @xmath75_{\\pm}\\rangle_i$ ] ( @xmath128 ) .",

    "the weight distribution does not change much down to @xmath508 .",
    "compared to the nrg results in fig.5(d ) , sc gives quantitatively correct peak position of hubbard bands .",
    "what is missing in the sc results is the central kondo resonance at small @xmath124 and the continuous weight transfer from the lower hubbard band to the higher one as @xmath124 decreases .",
    "this is again a consequence of the atomic - like truncation scheme used in eq.([eq:93 ] ) and eq.([eq:95 ] ) .",
    "overall , in the low temperature limit , bse and bcf have diverging positions of hubbard peaks , while sc maintains correct peak position but has weaker spectral weight transfer compared to nrg . in the high temperature regime @xmath519 ,",
    "the shape of ldos from bcf and sc agree well with nrg .    in fig.6 , the sum rule , electron occupation , and the double occupancy as functions of @xmath124 are presented .",

    "at the low temperature limit , bcf gives out a fully polarized impurity @xmath520 , consistent with the enhanced asymmetry in ldos at the low-@xmath124 regime .",
    "in contrast , sc gives much weaker polarization , with @xmath499 saturating to @xmath521 at @xmath508 , much smaller than the nrg value @xmath522 . at the high - temperature regime @xmath519 , bcf and",

    "filled symbols are @xmath531 and empty symbols are @xmath532.,width=614,height=508 ]    we first discuss the validity range of the expansion schemes .",
    "the quality of an expansion is controlled by the small parameter @xmath0 in @xmath16 , which in our strong - coupling expansion for the anderson impurity model is characterized by the hybridization strength @xmath459 .",
    "roughly speaking , the validity range of the expansion is @xmath459 much smaller than all the other energy scales , including the interaction @xmath446 , temperature @xmath124 , and frequency @xmath28 . in figs.1 @xmath533 4 , @xmath534 is used which is on the boundary of the validity range , and the results have significant errors .",
    "it is seen from fig.6 that the agreement between the expansion and nrg is good for @xmath519 and @xmath535 .",
    "figures 3 and 4 shows that the agreement is also good for small @xmath536 due to the @xmath537-order accuracy acquired from the cf - resummation .",
    "figure 7(a ) and 7(b ) demonstrate that @xmath459 indeed sets in as the breakdown temperature scale in the present strong - coupling expansion approaches .",
    "taking the impurity magnetization @xmath538 as an example , we show the difference between the expansion and nrg results @xmath539 as functions of @xmath540 , for @xmath541 in fig.7(a ) and for @xmath542 in fig.7(b ) . for @xmath459 values ranging from @xmath543 to @xmath544 ,",
    "the magnetization from both bcf and sc approach the nrg values at @xmath545 , and deviate significantly at @xmath546 .",
    "similar behavior is observed in the double occupancy curve ( not shown here ) . in fig.7(c ) , we examine to what extent the friedel sum rule @xmath547 is satisfied at low temperatures.@xcite it is seen that for both spin polarized and un - polarized cases , this relation is fulfilled exactly only at @xmath472 .",
    "approximate fulfillment in seen in @xmath548 .",
    "since the friedel sum rule is a consequence of the fermi liquid ground state , it is not expect to be fulfilled well by the strong - coupling expansion which starts from the local moment limit .",
    "however , due to the cf - resummation method used in our approach , gf acquires the correct @xmath446 term and the friedel sum rule is satisfied in the regime @xmath549 .    to summarize , for @xmath519 , both bcf and sc schemes are quantitatively accurate in the regime @xmath535 , and produce a smoothly interpolation between large @xmath446 and small @xmath446 . for @xmath550 , accurate results can only be expected for @xmath536 .",
    "since the kondo scale @xmath551 is much smaller than @xmath459 for large @xmath446 , the kondo resonance can not be described by the the present strong - coupling expansion method .",
    "although the sc scheme improves over bse and bcf on the causality and the zero - temperature divergence problems , the appearance of a breakdown scale @xmath459 in the temperature axis is an obvious shortcoming , similar to the strong - coupling expansion for the hubbard model.@xcite considering that for the anderson impurity model , much better results are available from methods such as nrg , qmc , and functional renormalization group method@xcite , the present expansion schemes receives only partial success at this stage .",
    "however , the results are amenable to further improvement .",
    "the appearance of the breakdown scale in temperature and the zero - temperature divergence problem are related to the fact that @xmath552 is a singular point in the ground state of @xmath16 with a spin - polarized bath .",
    "one could avoid these problems by selecting a suitable @xmath2 whose ground state is continuously connected to that of @xmath16 .",
    "this issue will be studied in the future .",
    "below , we discuss some distinct features of the present expansion method compared to existing theories .",
    "the present approach is universal in the sense that it has no requirement on the form of @xmath2 . for any @xmath2 that is exactly solvable , i.e. , either its gf eom closes naturally , or its eigen states and eigen values are obtainable",
    ", series expansion of gf can be constructed in a unified framework . @xmath2- and",
    "@xmath3-specific diagrammatic rules are not needed in this method . by using the self - consistent eom expansion supplemented with cf resummation , causality of gf",
    "is guaranteed and the zero - temperature divergence problem removed .",
    "the resulting gf has extended range of validity .",
    "therefore , for those hamiltonians that both @xmath2 and @xmath3 are exactly solvable , by expanding gf from the two limits and comparing the results , one can obtain reliable knowledge in both the small and large interaction regimes . in principle , expansion around a cluster or impurity hamiltonian @xmath2 is also possible .",
    "this could provide a possible alternative derivation of the cluster perturbation theory@xcite or dual fermion dynamical mean - field theory.@xcite    the present approach is distinctive in that arbitrary double time gf can be expanded in the same framework . in the traditional methods ,",
    "calculation of gfs of more than one particle is a laborious task . here , due to the universality of the formalism",
    ", multiple - particle gf can be expanded in a way parallel to one - particle gf .",
    "for an example , the strong - coupling expansion method used in this paper for calculating the single particle gf can also be used to produce the dynamical spin- or charge- correlation functions , with only slight modification in the formalism .",
    "next , we discuss possible improvement and extensions of the present approach . as seen in fig.4(b ) and",
    "fig.6(b ) , @xmath466 from the second - order self - consistent strong - coupling expansion deviates significantly from the nrg result , even for @xmath446 as large as @xmath553 . also , the temperature dependence of @xmath499 is too weak .",
    "obviously there is much room to improve the result . to calculate the averages of the type @xmath379 ( in eq.([eq:88 ] ) ) and @xmath554 [ in eqs.([eq:90 ] ) and ( [ eq:91 ] ) ] , instead of using the atomic - like truncation scheme",
    ", we can carry out the self - consistent eom expansion for gfs @xmath555 and @xmath556 to @xmath10 order and calculate the averages from the cf - resummed gfs .",
    "also , a suitable selection of @xmath2 may help remedy the zero - temperature divergence problem and remove the breakdown scale in temperature .",
    "a by - product of the present method is the eom for the @xmath55-th order residue @xmath557 , eq.([eq:11 ] ) or eq.([eq:25 ] ) .",
    "it could be employed to produce higher order modifications to the series up to @xmath558 .",
    "the eom of @xmath557 is formally similar to that of the full gf @xmath8 , except that the lower order contributions have been singled out . in principle",
    ", it can be solved approximately by standard truncation schemes .",
    "this provide possibilities of constructing new types of truncation approximations which are exact up to order @xmath96 , or developing improved cf resummation formulas with a terminator.@xcite    an ideal expansion scheme may be that the resulting gf is exact simultaneously to @xmath559 and @xmath560 , and hence accurate in both the weak- and strong - coupling limits .",
    "as it is difficult to realize in traditional perturbation theories , it is apparently possible to achieve this goal in the eom expansion method .",
    "one could first carry out the weak - coupling expansion to obtain @xmath561 , and then carry out the strong - coupling expansion to @xmath203 order for the residue @xmath562 by employing its eom .",
    "the resulting gf @xmath563 satisfies the above requirement . in practice , however , the resummation method suitable for such an expansion is yet to be developed .",
    "direct multiple - variable expansion is also possible within the framework of eom expansion . for an example , the splitting of hamiltonian @xmath564 can be used to generate a gf expansion @xmath565 . if we choose @xmath566 , @xmath567 , and @xmath568 , the expansion up to lowest several orders can be obtained with ease .",
    "a subsequent resummation can be used to produce a physically meaningful result , being correct in both the strong- and weak - coupling limits .",
    "if the full hamiltonian is treated as a perturbation , the self - consistent expansion will produce a moment expansion of gf , while the bare expansion is equivalent to the simultaneous moment and high temperature expansions .",
    "the same strategy of expanding the double time gf can be extended straightforwardly to other gfs , if only the eom formalism also applies there .",
    "for an example , the keldysh gf describing the non - equilibrium process can be described by eom .",
    "the present eom - based expansion method can be extended to calculate the the keldysh gf .    from our demonstrative calculation for the weak- as well as strong - coupling expansion , it is clear that the present method also has some shortcomings . for most of the models ,",
    "it is difficult to obtain explicit expansion higher than second order because the complexity of calculation increases very fast with order .",
    "this feature is common in every expansion method such as the feynman diagram for weak - coupling expansion , metzner s diagram for strong - coupling expansion,@xcite or dai s direct expansion.@xcite in these techniques , the time ordering and multiple integrals will complicate the problem . with the aid of computer algebra , we hope that higher order gf could be obtained , similarly to the situation of strong - coupling expansion.@xcite another drawback of the present approach is that the partition function can only be obtained indirectly by using the coupling constant integral method .",
    "the calculation of free energy is important for studying thermodynamical properties and constructing the conserving approximations .",
    "the present eom - based expansion basically expands the excitation energies instead of the eigen energies .",
    "we have not yet found ways to construct the direct expansion of partition function .",
    "finally , differing from the diagrammatic methods where a diagram in arbitrary order can be evaluated directly , in the present method , series can be generated only recursively and calculated order by order .    in summary , we have presented an eom - based method for doing series expansion of double time gfs .",
    "we developed both the bare expansion and the self - consistent expansion formula . using this method",
    ", we carried out the second - order weak - coupling expansion as well as the strong - coupling expansion of the single particle gf for the single impurity anderson model .",
    "for the weak - coupling expansion , yamada s se up to @xmath9 is obtained . for the strong - coupling expansion , we obtained results from three different expansion - resummation schemes : the bare expansion with se resummation , bare expansion with cf resummation , and the self - consistent expansion with cf resummation .",
    "the latter overcomes both the causality problem and the zero - temperature divergence problem .",
    "we found that although they agree with nrg well in the large-@xmath446 and @xmath519 regimes , quantitative accuracy is not achieved at low temperature .",
    "some features of this new approach and possible extensions are discussed .",

    "( 11374362 ) , fundamental research funds for the central universities , and the research funds of renmin university of china 15xnlq03 .",

    "@xmath571 can be solved easily by its right - hand side eom as @xmath172 .",
    "direct eom for the three - particle gf @xmath572 will lead to new three - particle gfs and the closure of the hierarchy is slow .",
    "so we first diagonalize the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath2 ( eq.([eq:28 ] ) in the main text ) in the single - particle space and obtain @xmath573 here @xmath574 is the single particle orbital index .",
    "we assume @xmath575 with @xmath576 . using the quasi - particle gf of @xmath577 @xmath578",
