    "a complete understanding of photochemistry often requires photodynamics calculations since photochemical reactions may have excess energy and do not follow the lowest energy pathway , and since dynamic , as much as energetic , considerations often govern how a reaction jumps from one electronic potential energy surface ( pes ) to another .",
    "unfortunately , full photodynamics calculations are prohibitively expensive for all but the smallest molecules unless simplifying approximations are made .",
    "one such approximation is to adopt a tully - type mixed quantum / classical surface - hopping ( sh ) trajectory approach @xcite where the electrons are described quantum mechanically and the nuclei classically .",
    "then , since the quantum part of the calculation remains the computational bottleneck , further simplifications are required for an efficient electronic structure computation of the photochemical dynamics .    time - dependent density - functional theory",
    "( tddft ) @xcite represents a promising and relatively inexpensive alternative @xcite to accurate but more costly quantum chemical approaches for on - the - fly calculations of excitation energies .",
    "tddft methods for excited - state dynamics are not yet a standard part of the computational chemistry repertory but are coming on line .",
    "in particular , the basic methodology for the computation of analytic gradients has now been implemented in a number of codes @xcite and important practical progress is being made on the problem of calculating sh integrals within tddft @xcite .",
    "indeed first applications of mixed tddft / classical sh dynamics are being reported @xcite .",
    "problems in this new technology can be expected and modifications in the basic tddft methods will be necessary to enlarge the class of its potential applications . in particular , practical tddft calculations employ approximate functionals whose performance in describing photochemical problems requires careful validation .",
    "few applications of tddft to problems relevant to photochemistry can be found in the literature  @xcite and the few attempts made to assess the value of tddft for photochemical applications report either encouraging @xcite or discouraging results @xcite .",
    "the fundamental reasons for these descrepencies stem from the fact that conventional tddft has several problems which may or may not be fatal for modeling a given photochemical reaction . the main difficulties encountered in conventional tddft include the underestimation of the ionization threshold @xcite , the underestimation of charge transfer excitations @xcite , and the lack of explicit two- and higher - electron excitations @xcite . still other difficulties are discussed in pertinant reviews @xcite .    to help tddft",
    "become a reliable tool for modeling photochemistry , we must first obtain a clear idea of what are its most severe problems .",
    "it is the objective of this article to identify the most critical points where improvement needs to be made , at least for one prototypical molecule and one type of reaction path .",
    "the reaction chosen for our study is the photochemical ring opening of oxirane .",
    "the photochemistry of oxirane and of oxirane derivatives has been much studied both theoretically and experimentally ( appendix  [ sec : photochem ] ) .",
    "it is a text - book molecule used to discuss orbital control of stereochemistry in the context of electrocyclic ring opening .",
    "textbook discussions usually focus on cc ring opening ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite pp .  258 - 260 )",
    "but a discussion of co ring opening may also be found ( ref .",
    "@xcite pp .",
    "408 - 411 ) . at first glance",
    ", this would seem to be a particularly good test case for tddft .",
    "that is , oxirane is a simple molecule with a relatively simple photochemistry where tddft should work and , if not , where its failures will be particularly easy to analyze . in this paper , we will focus on the symmetric ring opening of this molecule even though the photochemical ring opening does not follow a symmetric pathway .",
    "the reason for our choice is the usual reason @xcite , namely that the use of symmetry greatly facilitates analysis and hence the construction of and comparison with highly accurate quantum monte carlo results .",
    "a mixed quantum / classical sh trajectory study of asymmetric ring opening will be reported elsewhere @xcite .    in the next section",
    ", we give a brief review of dft and of tddft . in sec .",

    "the ( td)dft pes for the @xmath0th excited state is calculated at each nuclear configuration by adding the @xmath0th tddft excitation energy to the dft ground state energy , so @xmath1 .",
    "[ hartree atomic units ( @xmath2 ) are used throughout the paper . ]",
    "even though the use of parentheses in the expression ( td)dft better emphasizes the hybrid dft + tddft nature of the calculation , we will usually follow the common practice of simply refering to tddft pess .",
    "the purpose of this section is to review those aspects of tddft most necessary for understanding the rest of the paper .",
    "the hybrid dft + tddft nature of ( td)dft calculations indicates that problems with the ground state pes can easily become problems for the excited - state pess .",
    "thus it is important to begin with a few words about the ground - state problem .",
    "the simplest methods for treating the ground state are the hartree - fock ( hf ) method and the kohn - sham formulation of dft . in recent years",
    ", the use of hybrid functionals has permitted the two energy expressions to be written in the same well - known form , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the hf exchange energy and @xmath5 and @xmath6 are generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) exchange ( x ) and exchange - correlation ( xc ) energies .",
    "the coefficient @xmath7 controls the amount of hartree - fock exchange , being unity for hartree - fock , zero for pure dft , and fractional ( typically around 0.25 @xcite ) for hybrid functionals . for more information about dft",
    ", we refer the reader to refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "time - dependent density - functional theory offers a rigorous approach to calculating excitation energies .",
    "unlike time - dependent hartree - fock ( tdhf ) , tddft is formally exact .",
    "consequently , although approximate exchange - correlation functionals must be used in practice , we can hope that good approximations will lead to better results than those obtained from tdhf which completely lacks correlation effects . in practice",
    ", the use of hybrid functionals means that tddft contains tdhf as a particular choice of functional ( i.e. , the exchange - only hybrid functional with @xmath8 ) .",
    "the most common implementation of tddft is via a kohn - sham formalism using the so - called adiabatic approximation which assumes that the self - consistent field responds instantaneously and without memory to any temporal change in the charge density .",
    "this allows the time - dependent exchange - correlation action quantity in tddft to be replaced with the more familiar exchange - correlation energy from conventional tddft .",
    "excitations may be obtained from the linear response formulation of tddft ( lr - tddft ) .",

    "this is particularly easy to see in the context of the tamm - dancoff approximation ( tda ) to eq .",
    "( [ eq : tddft.10 ] ) whose tddft variant is usually attributed to hirata and head - gordon @xcite .",
    "the tda simply consists of neglecting the @xmath13 matrices to obtain , @xmath16 .",
    "the number of possible solutions to this equation is the dimensionality of @xmath12 which is just the number of single excitations .",
    "in fact , the lr - tdhf tda ( exchange - only hybrid functional with @xmath8 ) is simply the well - known configuration interaction singles ( cis ) method .",
    "an issue of great importance in the context of the present work is triplet instabilities .",
    "these have been first analyzed by bauernschmitt and ahlrichs @xcite in the context of dft , but the explicit association with lr - tddft excitation energies was made later @xcite .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we suppose that the ground - state dft calculation has been performed using a same - orbitals - for - different - spin ( sods ) ansatz and we now wish to test to see if releasing the sods restriction to give a different - orbitals - for - different - spin ( dods ) solution will lower the energy .",
    "to do so we consider an arbitary unitary tranformation of the orbitals , @xmath17    \\psi_{r\\sigma}({\\bf r})\\,.\\ ] ] where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are real operators .",
    "the corresponding energy expression is , @xmath20    + { \\cal o}(\\lambda^3 ) \\",

    "the presence of the terms @xmath22 shows the connection with the pseudoeigenvalue problem  ( [ eq : tddft.10 ] ) which can be rewritten as the eigenvalue problem , @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",
    "it is an easy consequence of eq .",
    "( [ eq : tddft.11 ] ) that the matrix @xmath25 is always positive definite for pure functionals ( @xmath26 ) , as long as the _ aufbau _ principle is obeyed",
    ". however @xmath27 may have negative eigenvalues . in that case",
    ", the energy @xmath28 will fall below @xmath29 for some value of @xmath30 , indicating a lower symmetry - broken solution . at the same time",
    ", this will correspond to a negative value of @xmath31 ( i.e. , an imaginary value of @xmath32 . ) a further analysis shows the corresponding eigenvector corresponds to a triplet excitation , hence the term `` triplet instability '' for describing this phenomenon . in principle , when hybrid functionals are used , singlet instabilities are also possible",
    ".    thus imaginary excitation energies in lr - tddft are an indication that something is wrong in the description of the ground state whose time - dependent response is being used to obtain those excitation energies . as pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite , the tda actually acts to _ decouple _ the excited - state problem from the ground - state problem so that tda excitations may actually be _",
    "better _ than full lr - tddft ones .",
    "typically , full and tda lr - tddft excitation energies are close near a molecule s equilibrium geometry , where a single - determinantal wave function is a reasonable first approximation and begin to differ as the single - determinantal description breaks down .",
    "interestingly , there is a very simple argument against symmetry breaking in exact dft for molecules with a nondegenerate ground state . since the exact ground - state wave function of these molecules is a singlet belonging to the totally symmetric representation and so with the same symmetry as the molecule , the spin - up and spin - down charge densities will be equal and",
    "also have the same symmetry as the molecule .",
    "it follows that the same must hold for the spin - up and spin - down components of the exact exchange - correlation potential .",
    "since the potentials are the same , then the molecular orbitals must also be the same for different spins .",
    "thus , no symmetry breaking is expected in exact dft for molecules with a nondegenerate ground state .",
    "note however that the functional is still dependent on spin so that the spin kernels @xmath33 and @xmath34 are different .",
    "the interested reader will find additional information about tddft in the recent book of ref .",
    "the quality of our ( td)dft calculations is judged against highly accurate quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) results . for each state of interest",
    ", the qmc results are obtained in a three step procedure .",
    "first , a conventional complete active space ( cas ) self - consistent field ( scf ) calculation is performed .",
    "the resultant casscf wave function is then reoptimized in the presence of a jastrow factor to include dynamical correlation and used in a variational monte carlo ( vmc ) calculation .",
    "finally , the vmc result is further improved via diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) .    to properly describe a reaction involving bond breaking",
    ", it is necessary to adopt a multi - determinantal description of the wave function . in the casscf method ,",
    "a set of active orbitals is selected , whose occupancy is allowed to vary , while all other orbitals are fixed as either doubly occupied or unoccupied . in a casscf(@xmath35,@xmath36 ) calculation , @xmath35 electrons are distributed among an active space of @xmath36 orbitals and all possible resulting space- and spin - symmetry - adapted configuration state functions ( csfs ) are constructed .",
    "the final casscf(@xmath35,@xmath36 ) wave function consists of a linear combination of these csfs , like in a full configuration interaction ( ci ) calculation for @xmath35 electrons in @xmath36 orbitals , except that also the orbitals are now optimized to minimize the total energy . in the present article",
    ", we consider 4 electrons in an active space of 6 orbitals which represents the minimal active space for a proper description of all 9 states of interest .",
    "when several states of the same symmetry are requested , there is a danger in optimizing the higher states that their energy is lowered enough to approach and mix with lower states , thus giving an unbalanced description of excitation energies .",
    "a well - established solution to this problem is the use of a state averaged ( sa ) casscf approach where the weighted average of the energies of the states under consideration is optimized  @xcite .",
    "the wave functions of the different states depend on their individual sets of ci coefficients using a common set of orbitals .",
    "orthogonality is ensured via the ci coefficients and a generalized variational theorem applies .",
    "obviously , the sa - casscf energy of the lowest state will be higher than the casscf energy obtained without sa . in the present work ,",
    "we need to apply the sa procedure only for the @xmath37 state in the @xmath38 ring opening .",
    "although the casscf and sa - casscf @xmath39 energies are found to be really very close , we calculate the @xmath37 energy as @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "a similar procedure is used in the case of the corresponding qmc calculations .",
    "qmc methods  @xcite offer an efficient alternative to conventional highly - correlated _ ab initio _ methods to go beyond casscf and provide an accurate description of both dynamical and static electronic correlation . the key ingredient which determines the quality of a qmc calculation is the many - body trial wave function which , in the present work , is chosen of the jastrow - slater type with the particular form , @xmath41 where @xmath42 denotes the distance between electrons @xmath43 and @xmath44 , and @xmath45 the distance of electron @xmath43 from nucleus @xmath46 .",
    "we use here a jastrow factor @xmath47 which correlates pairs of electrons and each electron separately with a nucleus , and employ different jastrow factors to describe the correlation with different atom types .",
    "the determinantal component consists of a cas expansion , @xmath48 , and includes all possible csfs obtained by placing 4 electrons in the active space of 6 orbitals as explained above .",
    "all parameters in both the jastrow and the determinantal component of the wave function are optimized by minimizing the energy . since the optimal orbitals and expansion coefficients in @xmath48 may differ from the casscf values obtained in the absence of the jastrow factor @xmath47 , it is important to reoptimize them in the presence of the jastrow component .    for a wave function corresponding to the lowest state of a given symmetry ,",
    "we follow the energy - minimization approach of ref .",
    "if the excited state is not the lowest in its symmetry , we obtain the jastrow and orbitals parameters which minimize the average energy over the state of interest and the lower states , while the linear coefficients in the csf expansion ensure that orthogonality is preserved among the states  @xcite . therefore , the wave functions resulting from the state - average optimization will share the same jastrow parameters and the same set of orbitals but have different linear coefficients .",
    "this scheme represents a generalization of the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite where only the orbitals were optimized and orthogonality was only approximately preserved .",
    "the present approach is therefore superior to the one of ref .",
    "@xcite , which was however already giving excellent results when tested on several singlet states of ethylene and a series of prototypical photosensitive molecules  @xcite .",
    "we note that , when a cas expansion is used in the absence of the jastrow component , the method is analogous to the casscf technique for the lowest state of a given symmetry , and to a sa - casscf approach if the excited state is not the lowest in its symmetry .",
    "the trial wave function is then used in diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) , which produces the best energy within the fixed - node approximation [ i.e. , the lowest - energy state with the same zeros ( nodes ) as the trial wave function ] .",
    "all qmc results presented are from dmc calculations .",
    "calculations were carried out with two different computer programs , namely gaussian 03 @xcite and a development version of demon2k @xcite .",
    "we use the two programs in a complementary fashion as they differ in ways which are important for this work .",
    "in particular , gaussian can carry out hf calculations while demon2k has no hartree - fock exchange .",
    "similarly , gaussian can carry out time - dependent hf ( tdhf ) and configuration interaction singles ( cis ) calculations which are not implemented in demon2k .",
    "in contrast , the tamm - dancoff approximation ( tda ) for tddft may only be performed with demon2k .",
    "the present version of demon2k is limited to the local density approximation for the exchange - correlation tddft kernel , while the kernel is more general in gaussian .",
    "finally , gaussian makes automatic use of symmetry and prints out the irreducible representation for each molecular orbital .",
    "the particular version of demon2k used in the present work does not have this feature so we rely on comparison with the output of gaussian calculations for this aspect of our analysis .",
    "all gaussian results reported here are calculated with the extensive 6 - 311++g**(2d,2p ) basis set @xcite .",

    "the tdb3lyp calculations were found to be easier to converge , presumably because they have less self - interaction error .",

    "unfortunately , gaussian did not always print out the lowest triplet excitation energy , so we prefer to report our more complete demon2k results .",
    "the _ third _ point is the presence of a triplet instability .",
    "this means that , going away from the equilibrium geometry , the _ square _ of the first triplet excitation energy decreases , becomes zero , and then negative .",
    "the exact meaning of triplet instabilities will be discussed further below . for now , note that _ we follow the usual practice for response calculations by indicating an imaginary excitation energy as a negative excitation energy .",
    "_ however it is important to keep in mind that a negative excitation energy in this context is only a common convention and not a physical reality .",
    "incidentally , we presume that triplet instability is the source of the difficulty with the gaussian output mentioned above  the associated coefficients become more complicated and gaussian may have difficulty analyzing them .",
    "fourth _ and final point is that the tddft ionization threshold occurs at minus the value of the homo energy which is significantly underestimated with ordinary functionals such as the lda and b3lyp @xcite .",
    "this artificially low ionization threshold is indicated in the two graphs in fig .",

    "the tddft calculations are qualitatively capable of describing these one - electron rydberg excitations but not of describing the two - electron excitation in the bond - breaking region . as expected , the cusp in the dft @xmath39 ground state curve is simply reflected as cusps in the tddft @xmath94 excited - state curve .",

    "this is that the manifold of excited state pess is too complicated to interpret easily .",
    "the best way around this is to move from a pes interpretation to a pathway interpretation of photochemistry , and the best way to find the pathways moving along and between adiabatic pess seems to be to carry out dynamics . for",
    "now , it looks as though the use of tddft / tda in photodynamics simulations may suffice to describe the principal photochemical processes in oxirane .",
    "on - going calculations @xcite do indeed seem to confirm this assertion in so far as trajectories have been found in good agreement with the accepted gomer - noyes mechanism @xcite .",
    "the generic structure of oxiranes is shown as the starting point in the chemical reactions in figs .  [",
    "fig : alkyl_oxirane ] and [ fig : aryl_oxirane ] .",
    "when r@xmath140 , r@xmath119 , r@xmath141 , and r@xmath142 are hydrogens or alkyl groups , then the prefered reaction is co cleavage both photochemically and thermally ( step 1 , fig .",
    "[ fig : alkyl_oxirane ] ) .",
    "in particular it is estimated that the co rupture energy is about 52 kcal / mol while the cc rupture energy is 5 - 7 kcal / mol higher @xcite .",
    "since the molecule is not symmetric along the co ring - opening pathway , the wh model does not apply .",
    "photochemical co ring opening may be followed by alkyl migration @xcite ( step 2 , fig .",
    "[ fig : alkyl_oxirane ] ) . in the particular case of oxirane itself ( r@xmath140=r@xmath119=r@xmath141=r@xmath142=h ) , hydrogen migration",
    "is followed by breaking of the cc single bond ( step 3 , fig .",
    "[ fig : alkyl_oxirane ] ) .",
    "this is the gomer - noyes mechanism @xcite which was confirmed experimentally by ibuki , inasaki , and takesaki @xcite .",
    "in contrast , cyano and aryl substitutions favor cc bond breaking ( step 1 , fig .  [",
    "fig : aryl_oxirane ] ) to form what is often refered to as a 1,3-dipolar species or a carbonyl ylide .",
    "this is the case where there may be sufficient symmetry that the wh model applies .",
    "the photochemistry of phenyl and phenyl substituted oxiranes has been reviewed in refs .",
    "@xcite and on pages 565 - 566 of ref .",
    "evidence for carbonyl ylides goes back to at least the 1960s when ullman and milks investigated the tautomerization of 2,3-diphenylindenone oxide @xcite and linn and benson investigated the ring - opening reaction of tetracyanoethylene oxide @xcite . finding cases where the wh model applies and where its predictions can be verified turns out to be not straightforward , particularly in the photochemical case .",
    "there are several reasons for this .",
    "first of all , too much asymmetry should be avoided in order to assure the applicability of the wh orbital symmetry conservation rule and so avoid passing directly onto carbene formation ( step 2 , fig .",
    "[ fig : aryl_oxirane ] ) .",
    "secondly , the substituted oxirane should include groups which are bulky enough to confer the structural rigidity needed to avoid premature radiationless relaxation , but not bulky enough to favor carbene formation .",
    "the predictions of the wh model have been found to hold for _ cis_- and _",
    "trans_-1,2-diphenyloxirane @xcite while carbene formation dominates for tetraphenyl oxirane @xcite .",
