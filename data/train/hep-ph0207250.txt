    "inclusive unpolarized and polarized deeply inelastic diffractive scattering at high energies and momentum transfer is one of the important processes in lepton ",
    "nucleon scattering . as found by experiment , cf .",
    "@xcite , there are interesting relations between the cross sections of these processes and those of inclusive deeply inelastic scattering :  _ i ) _ the scaling violations of both processes are quite similar and  _ ii ) _ the ratio of the differential cross sections in @xmath2 and @xmath3 are widely constant in the whole kinematic domain and are of @xmath4 . whereas the latter aspect can not be understood with perturbative methods the former calls for a rigorous analysis in perturbative qcd . in recent analyses  @xcite",
    "this aspect has been investigated both for the unpolarized and the polarized case on the basis of the light  cone expansion . by this method",
    "the semi - exclusive processes of diffractive scattering could be related to forward scattering processes at short distances , for which similar evolution equations as in the deep inelastic case apply .",
    "moreover a callan  gross and wandzura - wilczek relation between the twist2 contributions of the diffractive structure functions were derived . in this note",
    "we give a summary of these papers .",
    "the process of deep inelastic diffractive scattering is @xmath5 , with a significant rapidity gap between @xmath6 and the remaining hadrons .",
    "the differential scattering cross section for single ",
    "photon exchange is given by @xmath7 with @xmath8 and @xmath9 the leptonic and hadronic tensors .",
    "using current conservation , p and t invariance and the hermiticity relation for the hadronic tensor one finds a representation of the hadronic tensor in terms of four unpolarized and eight polarized structure functions  @xcite .",
    "we will henceforth consider the case of small values of @xmath10 . in this limit",
    "the outgoing and incoming proton momenta are related by @xmath11 and the cross section depends on two unpolarized and two polarized structure functions only @xmath12 with @xmath13 and @xmath14 for @xmath15 .",
    "( [ eqhadr ] ) is considered in the generalized bjorken limit :   @xmath16 and @xmath17 = fixed .",
    "the non - forward variable @xmath18 is related to another variable often used , @xmath19 , by @xmath20 . in the limit",
    "@xmath21 the above structure functions depend on the three variables @xmath22 and @xmath3 .    since for diffractive processes the outgoing proton",
    "is well separated in rapidity from the diffractively produced hadrons ( rapidity gap ) , one may apply a. mueller s generalized optical theorem @xcite to calculate the scattering cross section .",
    "this is done moving the outgoing proton into an incoming anti - proton and considering the absorptive part of deep inelastic forward scattering off the state @xmath23 summing over all final - state spins . note that under this interchange @xmath24 is kept space  like . due to this operation",
    "we may now evaluate the compton ",
    "operator @xmath25 \\\\ & = &   -e^2 \\frac{\\tilde x^\\lambda}{2 \\pi^2 ( x^2-i\\epsilon)^2 }   rt   \\left [ \\overline{\\psi } \\left(\\frac{\\tilde",

    "we represent this operator in terms of a vector and an axial - vector operator , which are in turn related to the associated scalar and pseudo - scalar operators , through which we introduce the respective operator expectation values , see @xcite defining non  forward parton densities @xmath26 , @xmath27 with @xmath28 and @xmath29 . here",
    "we neglect sub - leading components @xmath30 . after passing a series of steps , see @xcite , we may express the hadronic tensor in this approximation by one unpolarized and one polarized distribution function , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively . for quarks and anti - quarks these distribution functions , which are the diffractive parton distributions , read @xmath33",
    "the upper sign refers to quarks , the lower to anti - quarks , and @xmath34 in the unpolarized case , @xmath35 in the polarized case , where @xmath36 .",

    "the emergence of the integral term in one of the above relations is due to a basic connection between a vector  valued non  forward distribution function and the associated scalar one  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding term exceptionally cancels in the callan  gross relation but is present in most relations of this type , see also  @xcite .",
    "the evolution equations of the diffractive parton densities can be formulated starting with the evolution equations for the scalar quark and gluon operators in the flavor non  singlet and singlet case , see e.g. @xcite . @xmath43 with @xmath44 the factorization scale .",
    "forming expectation values as in the foregoing section one notices that the evolution does not depend on the value of the light - cone mark @xmath45 , which can be set to 0 .",
    "moreover the all - order rescaling relation @xmath46 where @xmath47 , is applied .",
    "after some calculation one finds the following evolution equations @xmath48 these equations apply both to the unpolarized and polarized diffractive parton densities of twist2 to all orders in the coupling constant . in the calculation",
    "the absorptive part of the distribution was taken , which identifies the original momentum fraction , cf .",
    "@xcite , @xmath49 with @xmath50 and results in evolution equations with a support [ 0,1 ] , unlike those in @xmath51 . if compared to the case of deep - inelastic scattering the evolution is here not in @xmath2 but in the new variable @xmath41 .",
    "otherwise the same evolution equations are obtained .",
    "this holds also for higher twist operators , for which the argument is exactly the same as given in this section , see  @xcite .",
    "we derived the twist2 evolution equations for the unpolarized and polarized twist2 diffractive parton distributions considering these processes in the light ",
    "cone expansion at short distances .",
    "we also derived relations between the diffractive structure functions in the unpolarized and polarized case .",
    "the observed similarity of the scaling violations between deep - inelastic diffractive and deep ",
    "inelastic structure functions was shown in the present approach being due to the same structure of evolution equations which act in the former case on the variable @xmath41 and in the latter on @xmath2 . polarized deep ",
    "inelastic scattering was not yet observed nor studied in detail in a larger kinematic domain .",
    "it would be interesting to know if the pattern of relations as observed for unpolarized scattering repeats and the predictions of the present paper can be verified .",
