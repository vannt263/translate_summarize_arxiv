    "the liquid - liquid phase transition ( llpt ) , defined as a transition between two liquid states of different densities , called low density liquid ( ldl ) and high density liquid ( hdl ) , has received considerable attention not only due to its rarity in nature , but also due to its importance in our fundamental understanding of the liquid state of matter @xcite .",
    "the llpt was observed in many systems , such as elemental @xcite , ionic @xcite , molecular @xcite , and covalent @xcite liquids . in some cases ,",
    "the llpt can terminate at a liquid - liquid critical point ( llcp ) .",
    "systems such as liquid water , silicon , silica , and germanium , possess analogous thermodynamic and dynamic anomalies @xcite .",
    "the critical phenomena near the llcp are of crucial importance for the understanding of the anomalous properties in these systems @xcite",
    ". however the detection of the llcp or the llpt can be difficult due to the fact that in many cases , the llcp is deeply buried in the supercooled region , where crystallization may occur before we reach the llcp  @xcite .",
    "for example , in the case of water , it has been hypothesized that the putative llcp is the cause of water anomalies @xcite , but the existence of a llcp for bulk water in the deeply supercooled region has not been directly verified by experiments due to crystallization , even though indications of the existence of the llcp have been found both in pressure induced melting experiments @xcite and in nanoconfined water @xcite .    according to scaling theory , asymptotically near the critical point",
    "all response functions can be expressed in terms of the correlation length @xcite .",
    "different response functions diverge at the critical point , and display maxima in the one - phase region along constant pressure @xmath1 paths or constant temperature @xmath0 paths @xcite .",
    "the loci of different response function maxima in the @xmath0-@xmath1 plane are different , but they converge in the vicinity of the critical point to a single line , called the widom line @xcite .",
    "theoretically , widom line is defined as the locus of maximum correlation length @xmath2 as function of ordering field at constant thermal field in the one - phase region .",
    "approaching the critical point , the magnitude of the response functions increases , and becomes infinite at the critical point .",
    "this fact provide a new way of locating the critical point : instead of locating the critical point through the coexistence line below the critical temperature @xmath3 , we may locate the critical point through the widom line in the one - phase region from the higher temperature side by studying the behavior of the loci of response function maxima  @xcite .",
    "thus it is important to find a general model system with an accessible llcp which would permit detailed examination of the response functions in the vicinity of the llcp .",
    "the jagla model of liquids is a simplified model consisting of particles interacting via a spherically symmetric two - scale potential with both repulsive and attractive ramps @xcite . with a special choice of parameters ,",
    "the jagla model has an accessible llcp _ above _ the melting line @xcite , allowing us to explore the behavior near the llcp in equilibrium liquid states . in this case",
    ", the coexistence line between ldl and hdl is positively sloped , which means that when cooled down along the same isobar , the system changes from ldl to hdl .",
    "this behavior is opposite to that of water , where experiments @xcite and simulations @xcite show that the coexistence line might be negatively sloped , and an isobaric cooling path transforms the system from hdl to ldl @xcite .    gibson and wilding found that by changing the parameters of the jagla potential it is possible to reduce the slope of the coexistence line to zero @xcite . in this paper",

    "both of the @xmath28 maxima lines as functions of @xmath0 are related to critical fluctuations , and start from the llcp and extend symmetrically above and below @xmath66 .",
    "in addition , a third @xmath28 maxima line as a function of @xmath1 at constant @xmath0 can be defined .",
    "all these three @xmath28 maxima lines converge at the llcp , and together with the @xmath30 minimum line , can be used to locate the llcp . since in case of coexistence line with zero slope , the thermal field practically consides with temperature , this third @xmath28 maxima line gives the best approximation for the widom line .",
    "for negatively sloped coexistence line , the phase diagram near the critical point is similar to the phase diagram for the positively sloped coexistence line case reflected with respect to critical pressure @xmath130 .",
    "this follows from the linear scaling theory of the critical point since according to eq .",
    "( [ responsef ] ) @xmath131 , @xmath132 , while @xmath133 , which comes from the symmetry of the functions with @xmath134 , @xmath135 , and @xmath136 being even , but @xmath137 being odd .",
    "the @xmath30 maxima line and one of the @xmath28 maxima lines both originate from the llcp and extend into the one - phase region , while overlapping with each other in the vicinity of the critical point [ fig .",
    "[ ptmax](b ) ] .",
    "the second @xmath28 maxima line goes above the pressure of the critical point , and terminates at the point of maximum pressure of the hdl spinodal , where the tmd line also terminates .",
    "note that the location of the critical point with respect to the tmd line is related to the slope of the coexistence line .",
    "when the slope of the coexistence line is positive , the critical point stays outside the density anomaly region ; when it is negative , the critical point is inside the density anomaly region ; when it is horizontal , the tmd line terminates right at the llcp [ fig .",
    "[ ptmax ] ] . indeed ,",
    "when the slope is positive , the volume of the low temperature phase is smaller than the volume of the high temperature phase .",
    "thus if we connect these two phases by the isobar with @xmath71 , the volume along this isobar decreases with @xmath0 , the region above the critical point corresponds to the @xmath138 and , because @xmath139 is a continuous function everywhere except at the llcp , @xmath139 also remains positive in the one - phase region for pressure below the llcp .",
    "accordingly , the llcp lies outside the region of density anomaly .",
    "analogous considerations show that , when the slope of the coexistence line is negative , the llcp remains inside the density anomaly region , as is surely the case for water .",
    "we note that , in all three cases , the two @xmath28 maxima lines , merging with the @xmath28 minima lines , form a loop and cross the tmd line at its highest temperature point @xcite .    by changing the parameters of the jagla interacting potential , we can obtain systems with different slopes of the llpt coexistence line .",
    "we find that , when the slope of the coexistence line is small , the identification of the widom line is no longer possible by tracing the @xmath30 maxima . as the slope of the coexistence line approaches zero ,",
    "the @xmath30 maxima lines become increasingly vertical and , when the slope of the coexistence line is horizontal , it can not be observed in simulations .",
    "the study of @xmath30 maxima is best reserved for systems in which the slope of the coexistence line is strongly positive or negative .",
    "however , the response function maxima in terms of density fluctuations are still well defined , and it is possible to identify the widom line by following the loci of @xmath28 maxima .",

    "<S> we find that the method of identifying the widom line as the loci of heat capacity maxima becomes unfruitful when the slope of the coexistence line approaches zero in the @xmath0-@xmath1 plane . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the specific heat displays no maximum in the one - phase region because for a horizontal phase coexistence line , according to the clapeyron equation , the enthalpy difference between the coexisting phases is zero , and thus there can be no contribution to enthalpy fluctuations from the critical fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> the extension of the coexistence line beyond the critical point into the one - phase region must in this case be performed using density fluctuations ; the line of compressibility maxima remains well defined , though it bifurcates into a symmetrical pair of lines . </S>",
