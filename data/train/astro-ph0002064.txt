    "electric fields from nearly all astrophysical sources are indistinguishable from gaussian noise .",
    "thus , nearly all of the information in such signals lies in variances of and covariances between electric fields of different polarizations , spatial locations , or frequencies .",
    "spectra and cross - power spectra are estimates of the variance or covariance of the electric field as a function of frequency .",
    "these spectra are the fourier transforms of auto- or cross - correlation functions .",
    "such correlation functions are the averaged products of pairs of elements drawn from the series , for a range of time offsets or `` lags '' .",
    "the elements are drawn from separate series for cross - correlation , and from the same for autocorrelation .",
    "the resulting correlation , as a function of lag , is commonly averaged over enough realizations to provide the desired signal - to - noise ratio . the correlation function is then fourier transformed to form the desired cross - power or autocorrelation spectrum , as a function of frequency . in practice , correlation and averaging can take place before or after the fourier transform ; this makes little difference to the result from the standpoint of this paper .    often , data are digitized before correlation . for bandwidths that are within the capability of digital circuitry , processing is usually more accurate and economical for digital signals than for analog signals .",
    "digitization involves sampling , or averaging over time intervals ; and quantization , or describing the signal amplitude in each interval as one of a discrete set of values , rather than as a continuous variable .",
    "quantization is an intrinsically nonlinear operation that destroys information , unlike the linear operations of sampling and fourier transform .",
    "i find that quantization introduces effects similar to noise in the final result , as one might perhaps expect .",
    "usually observers wish to minimize noise , while maintaining an invertible , deterministic relationship between the mean correlation and the underlying covariance .",
    "optimal parameters for quantization , and errors from departures from those parameters , are topics of classic work in radio astronomy ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "calculation of the actual noise level can be important when signal strength varies rapidly , and quantizer settings can not remain optimal , as is sometimes the case for pulsars @xcite ; or when the distribution of the intensity of the signal must be measured accurately @xcite . as sensitivities of radiotelescopes improve , and as demands on the observed data increase , calculation of the noise level from quantizer parameters can be expected to become more important .    because correlation functions and spectra are averaged over many realizations , the central limit theorem implies that the resulting correlation function or spectrum has gaussian statistics .",
    "thus , the statistics of the spectrum are fully described by each spectral channel s mean and variance , and covariances between channels .",
    "the mean of the spectrum is the deterministic part of the measurement ; variances and covariances are the random part , or noise . in principle",
    ", one seeks to minimize the noise , while preserving the relationship between the mean and the underlying spectrum . in @xcite ( hereafter paper 1 ) , i discussed this problem for `` white '' signals , which have zero correlation except for elements of the two series with zero lag .",
    "here i consider the more general case , where signals have arbitrary spectral character , so that covariance can depend on lag .",
    "the effect of quantization on the statistics of such `` colored '' spectra , particularly their noise , is the subject of this paper .",
    "i calculate the noise in the quantized cross- and autocorrelation functions .",
    "the noise differs from that for correlation of continuous data in additional terms , some of them constant and others proportional to the autocorrelation function , and products of auto- and cross - correlation functions .",
    "i present this calculation through second order in correlation .",
    "i then fourier transform these expressions to determine the mean spectrum and its variance .",
    "the mean spectrum is simply the fourier transform of the mean correlation function , while the noise in the spectrum is a double fourier transform of the noise in the correlation function .",
    "i find that in the spectral domain , a gain factor , and white noise added in quadrature , approximately represent the effects of quantization in a single channel .",
    "the added white noise is commonly known as `` quantization noise '' .",
    "indeed , the gain factor and the noise are identical to those previous workers found for the deterministic , mean spectrum @xcite .",
    "however , i also show that noise is correlated across spectral channels .",
    "this covariance can reduce , or increase , the total noise in the spectrum , depending on the details of the quantization scheme and the details of the spectrum .",
    "for `` white '' signals without spectral variation , the more general result of this paper reduces to that found in paper 1 . in this case , the correlations or anti - correlations of noise between channels can represent an effect of the same order as quantization noise , when integrated over all channels of a spectrum .",

    " [ continuous ]",
    "i introduce these underlying complex time series @xmath2 and @xmath3 and describe their assumed statistical properties .",
    "i calculate the mean and variance of their correlation function and its fourier transform .",
    "i show that covariance of noise in different spectral channels is zero for correlation of the continuous ( un - digitized ) series .",
    "i introduce information - destroying quantization in  [ quantized ] . under the assumption that the covariances are small ( except for the zero lag of the autocorrelation function , which must be 1 )",
    ", i calculate the mean and the variance of the quantized correlation function for quantized data , and present analytic expressions for them .",
    "i compare the analytical results with computer simulations and find excellent agreement .    in ",
    "[ section_quantspectrum ] i find the statistics of the cross - power and power spectra .",
    "the cross - power spectrum is the fourier transform of the cross - correlation function ; and the power spectrum ( sometimes called the autocorrelation spectrum ) is the fourier transform of the autocorrelation function .",
    "i calculate the noise in the spectra by a double fourier transform of the noise in the correlation functions .",
    "i show that the noise in a single spectral channel can be approximately represented by a gain factor and white `` digitization noise '' added in quadrature with the original signal .",

    "i present analytical results for autocorrelation functions , and autocorrelation spectra , in  [ acf_subsection ] and  [ acspect_subsection ] .",
    "i summarize results in  [ summary ] , and show that correlations of noise between channels can represent an effect of the same order as quantization noise , when integrated over all spectral channels .",

    "these might be , for example , the electric fields recorded as analog signals at two antennas .",
    "all elements of each are drawn from gaussian distributions in the complex plane .",
    "the distributions have zero mean .",
    "i further assume that the series are stationary , so that the properties of @xmath2 and @xmath3 are independent of the time index @xmath4 .",
    "thus , the variance of each series is constant , and the covariances between elements can depend only on their time separation and whether they belong to the same or different series .",
    "the ensemble - average spectra , defined in  [ meanspectrum ] below , depend only on these variances and covariances .    for this paper ,",
    "i assume that the series are statistically identical , in the sense that the exchange of @xmath0 and @xmath1 leaves the statistical properties of the spectra unchanged .",
    "instrumental effects often violate this assumption in a mild fashion , as by variations in complex gain between two antennas .",
    "sometimes the assumption is violated in a more fundamental way , as in spatial variation of the spatial and spectral character of scintillating sources @xcite .",

    "the issue is moot if the number of lags correlated is smaller than the span of data @xmath17 , or for `` fx '' correlators , which correlate in the frequency domain .",

    "[ avg_hat_rk ] ) . note that @xmath231 for all @xmath232 , so that the added noise component is always positive .",
    "this component is conveniently interpreted as quantization noise . in this particular approximation ,",
    "treatment of the effects of quantization as white noise added in quadrature is accurate .      because the noise in different spectral channels is covariant ( often with negative covariance ) , the integrated noise across a spectral channel is different from the summed , squared values of the noise in each channel ( often less ) .",
    "[ covar_pkplc ] ,  [ covar_pkpl ] , and  [ covar_akal ] give the covariances .",
    "although the covariances are smaller than the variances of the spectral channels given above by factors of @xmath29 , they sum coherently across the channel , whereas the variances do not .",
    "thus , in principle they yield comparable contributions when summed over all channels . in practice , of course , the results of such a sum are given by eqs .",
    "[ digital_rtrtc ] and  [ digital_rtrt ] with @xmath85 , or eq .",
    "[ a0a0c ] for autocorrelation , because the sum over all spectral channels yields the zeroth lag .",
    "the interested reader can verify that the results for this lag are identical to those of paper 1 , for a white spectrum .    in principle , the reduction of noise by the covariances offers the possibility of reducing quantization noise in a spectrally - narrow signal .",
    "for example , one could introduce additional correlated signals , with known @xmath233 and @xmath234 , and measure the variation of those from theoretically - expected results .",
    "using eqs .",
    "[ covar_pkplc ] ,  [ covar_pkpl ] , and  [ covar_akal ] one can calculate what weighted sum of those variations should be applied to the unknown signal , to reduce the noise as much as possible .",
    "this potential application is closely related to `` dithering '' in quantization ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "note that the noise in the cross - correlation function depends on both @xmath23 and @xmath25 .",
    "the variance @xmath235 measures the summed squares of the principal axes of the elliptical gaussian distribution of noise , or its overall size . as one might expect from eq .",
    "[ continuous_twrktwrkc ] , that size depends primarily on the autocorrelation spectrum in that channel @xmath30 .",
    "the error ellipse must maintain the same size under the transformation @xmath236 , so the noise can depend only on even powers of @xmath190 , as it does .",
    "similarly , the variance @xmath237 measures the difference of the squares of the principal axes of the elliptical gaussian distribution of noise , or its shape .",
    "this shape must be circular for @xmath238 , so that the variance must vanish there , and so one expects that it can not depend on @xmath190 independently of @xmath188 .",
    "[ continuous_twrktwrk ] confirms this .",
    "the difference must remain the same under the transformation @xmath239 , for example , so dependence on @xmath188 must be second order .",
    "numerical experiments suggest that eqs .",
    "[ digital_ckrkckrkc ] and  [ digital_ckrkckrk ] reach their limits most commonly for spectra encountered in radio astronomy when the autocorrelation function becomes large at lags other than the zero lag . for example",
    ", for a single narrow line , when the integrated power in the line becomes comparable to the integrated continuum ( including system noise ) , then the autocorrelation function will reach about 0.5 in nonzero lags .",
    "this usually leads to noise larger than that expected from the second - order analytical expressions , especially in channels containing the line , but also throughout the spectrum .",
    "for particular spectra , the additional noise can be modeled accurately by expressions that involve higher - order terms allowed by the preceding discussion , such as @xmath240 or @xmath241 .",
    "this paper investigates signal and noise for correlation of digitized data .",
    "i assume that the received data are noiselike , in the sense that amplitudes and phases are drawn from complex gaussian distributions in the spectral domain .",
    "the variance varies with frequency . for cross - correlation of two data streams ,",
    "covariance between the data streams may also depend on frequency .",
    "almost all astrophysical signals have this character .",
    "the variances and covariances contain all the information in the signal .",
    "the observed time series are the fourier transforms of these spectral components . at millimeter and longer wavelengths , these time series are commonly digitized , and then correlated to obtain estimates of the underlying variances and covariances .",
    "the correlation functions are finally fourier transformed to yield the estimated autocorrelation or cross - power spectrum . averaged over a number of realizations",
    ", the elements of the correlation function will approach a gaussian distribution .",
    "the mean correlation represents the deterministic part of a measurement , or the signal . the standard deviation of the measurement represents the random part , or noise .",
    "digitization of the signals involves quantization , which represents the continuous signal with a finite set of levels , and thus destroys information .",
    "this affects both the signal and the noise .",
    "i summarize results for continuous data in  [ continuous ] , and present new results , for noise for quantized data , in  [ quantized ] and  [ section_quantspectrum ] .    in  [ quantized ]",
    "i investigate statistics of correlation functions . under the assumption that the correlation is smaller than 1 ( except equal to 1 for the zero - lag of the autocorrelation function ) ,",
    "i find expressions for the mean cross- and autocorrelation functions .",
    "results agree with earlier work @xcite .",
    "i then find analytical expressions for the noise in the correlation functions .",
    "this noise takes the form of variances of the measured elements , as a function of lag ; and of covariances between the measured elements .    in ",
    "[ section_quantspectrum ] i investigate statistics of spectra .",
    "the mean spectra are related to the mean correlation functions by fourier transform ; the noise in the spectra is related to that in the correlation functions by a double fourier transform .",
    "i find that the mean cross - power spectrum for quantized data equals that for continuous data , times a gain factor .",
    "the mean autocorrelation spectrum equals that for continuous data times the same gain factor , plus white noise added in quadrature with the original data : `` quantization noise '' .",
    "this accords with previous results @xcite .",
    "i then find analytical expressions for the noise in the spectra .",
    "for both cross - power and autocorrelation spectra , i find that noise in one channel of a spectrum is equal to a gain factor times that for continuous data , plus the same quantization noise found for the autocorrelation spectrum .",
    "however , i also find that noise is correlated ( most commonly anticorrelated ) across spectral channels .",
    "thus , when noise increases the value measured in one channel above the mean , noise will tend to decrease the value measured in another channel .",
    "this correlation can produce a contribution comparable to , or even greater than , the quantization noise when summed over all spectral channels .",
    "i am grateful to the drao for supporting this work with extensive correlator time .",
    "i gratefully acknowledge the vsop project , which is led by the japanese institute of space and astronautical science in cooperation with many organizations and radio telescopes around the world .",
