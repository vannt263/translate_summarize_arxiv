    "supergravity on @xmath5 spaces has received a lot of attention in the last few years because of its conjectured relation to the conformal field theory @xcite .",
    "this relation implies the correspondence between the primary operators in the bulk and the supergravity fields propagating in the @xmath5 space .",
    "the standard way to formulate this correspondence goes as follows @xcite .",
    "suppose that the yang - mills coupling constant @xmath6 is very small and the thooft coupling constant @xmath7 is very large , then the dual string theory on @xmath8 should be well described by the classical supergravity . upon the reduction of the massless fields in the classical supergravity on @xmath9 we get the series of massive fields in ads , which correspond to the primary operators in the conformal field theory .",
    "the spectrum of the kaluza - klein excitations in ads supergravities was computed in @xcite , and this gives us the description of the spectrum of primary operators on the cft side .",
    "but this description is good only for those operators which have relatively small conformal dimensions . increasing the conformal dimension corresponds on the supergravity side to increasing the momentum of the kaluza - klein harmonic . when the momentum is high enough",
    ", it could happen that the linearized approximation to supergravity breaks down and we have to take into account interactions .",
    "let us consider for example the four - dimensional @xmath10 supersymmetric yang - mills theory which is dual to the type iib supergravity on @xmath8 .",
    "the kaluza - klein harmonics are parametrized by their momentum @xmath11 which is an integer ( strictly speaking , a set of integers ) .",
    "the energy of this harmonic is @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the radius of @xmath8 ( we assume that our harmonic saturates the bps bound ) .",
    "we can interpret this energy as the mass of the corresponding five - dimensional field in @xmath14 .",
    "the particle with such a mass has the schwarzschild radius @xmath15 where we have taken into account @xmath16 .",
    "we see that for @xmath17 the schwarzschild radius becomes larger then the compton wavelength , which indicates the breakdown of the linearized supergravity approximation .",
    "therefore the analysis of @xcite does not work for the high momentum states .",
    "the supergravity description of the @xmath1 bps states with high @xmath11 was found by mcgreevy , susskind and toumbas @xcite .",
    "they have found that these states should be considered not as kaluza - klein reductions of massless supergravity fields but as branes .",
    "this is an example of a general phenomenon : the massless particle can `` polarize '' and become a brane @xcite .",
    "the branes representing the high momentum states were called giant gravitons .",
    "giant gravitons preserving half of the supersymmetries have been studied in @xcite .",
    "it has been found that they come in two species .",
    "the first type are spheres inside @xmath9 , the projection of the worldvolume on the ads space being a timelike geodesic .",
    "the second type are the spheres inside @xmath14 , the projection on a sphere being an equator .",
    "( these two types are formally related by an analytic continuation , which relates @xmath8 to @xmath18 . ) in our paper we discuss more general configurations preserving @xmath2 or @xmath3 supersymmetry .",
    "we present a class of such configurations parametrized by the holomorphic curves in @xmath19 .",
    "we formulate our results and explain the cft meaning of our configurations in section 2 . in sections 3,4 and 5",
    "we prove that our configurations are supersymmetric . in section 6",
    "we derive the mass formula and verify the saturation of the bps bound . in section 7 we consider similar configurations in flat space . in appendix we comment on the relation between our results and the results of the linearized approximation which was developed in @xcite .",
    "consider a five - dimensional manifold @xmath11 embedded into a six - dimensional @xmath21 . in our application , @xmath11 is a part of the @xmath22-dimensional space - time of type iib string theory , and @xmath21 is an auxiliary manifold ( the orthogonal direction to @xmath11 in @xmath21 does not belong to the space - time and does not have any physical meaning ) .",
    "for example , we can take @xmath23 of @xmath8 , and @xmath21 to be @xmath24 .",
    "suppose that @xmath21 has a complex structure .",
    "in this situation , @xmath11 has a preferred field of directions .",
    "this field of directions is defined as follows .",
    "let @xmath25 be the unit vector in @xmath26 orthogonal to @xmath27 .",
    "then , @xmath28 belongs to the tangent space of @xmath11 .",
    "this gives us the field of directions in @xmath11 .",
    "we will do it in the following way .",
    "let us denote @xmath29 the intersection of @xmath30 with @xmath11 .",
    "we will consider @xmath29 to be the surface of the @xmath31 brane at time @xmath32 .",
    "let us move this brane by translation in the preferred direction @xmath33 with the speed of light . since @xmath33 is usually not orthogonal to @xmath29 , the surface elements of the brane actually move with the speed less than the speed of light .",
    "we claim that the resulting @xmath34-dimensional worldvolume is supersymmetric .",
    "let us consider @xmath35 .",
    "we denote @xmath36 the flat coordinates on @xmath19 , and @xmath9 is @xmath37 .",
    "suppose that @xmath30 is given by the equation @xmath38 .",
    "then , @xmath39 , and the resulting worldvolume is the giant graviton found in @xcite .",
    "the spatial trajectory of this giant graviton is @xmath40 .",
    "more generally , we can consider @xmath30 described by the equation of the form @xmath41 , and the worldsurface of the giant graviton at time zero will be @xmath42 suppose that we measure time as the length of the geodesic in ads .",
    "then , the worldsurface of the giant graviton at time @xmath43 will be : @xmath44 where @xmath13 is the radius of @xmath9 .",
    "this is a supersymmetric trajectory .",
    "we can apply our construction for gravitons in @xmath20 . in this case",
    ", we should embed @xmath0 into the conifold , as explained in @xcite : @xmath45 the manifold @xmath0 is a @xmath46 bundle over @xmath47 , and the preffered direction @xmath33 is in fact the direction along the fiber .",
    "translation along this preffered direction corresponds to the phase rotation of @xmath48 .",
    "the equation for the giant graviton is : @xmath49 we have not tried to turn on the gauge field living on the @xmath31 brane .",
    "the spacetime @xmath51 arises in the study of d - branes of type iib string theory on @xmath52 or @xmath53 .",
    "we will consider type iib on @xmath52 .",
    "d - branes with @xmath54 noncompact dimensions are effectively described as six - dimensional black strings .",
    "these black strings are classified by the charge @xmath55 .",
    "take a large number @xmath21 of black strings all having the same charge @xmath56 .",
    "the geometry of the near horizon region is @xmath57 .",
    "consider the probe string having the same charge @xmath56 .",
    "suppose that at the time @xmath58 the probe string spans a one - dimensional curve @xmath59 , and is a point in @xmath51 .",
    "let us think of @xmath60 as a group manifold of @xmath61 .",
    "suppose that our probe string moves along a geodesic line in @xmath51 and its position in @xmath60 changes as follows : @xmath62 where @xmath63 are pauli matrices , @xmath64 , @xmath43 is the length parameter along the geodesic . in other words ,",
    "we translate our effective string along the one - parameter subgroup in @xmath61 with the speed of light . we claim that this brane configuration is supersymmetric , preserving @xmath2 of the supersymmetries",
    ". we will prove it in section 4 .",
    "this gives us a class of supersymmetric configurations in @xmath50 parametrized by the one - dimensional curves @xmath59 .",
    "the construction of giant gravitons for @xmath65 is similar to the construction for @xmath8 .",
    "we embed @xmath67 into @xmath68 and consider intersections with the holomorphic surfaces in @xmath68 .",
    "we get configurations preserving @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 supersymmetries .",
    "supersymmetric cycles in @xmath66 can be constructed in the following way .",
    "we embed @xmath69 and represent @xmath70 .",
    "then we consider the cylindrical surfaces in @xmath71 of the form @xmath72 where @xmath73 is a holomorphic curve .",
    "intersection of these cylinders with @xmath74 gives us the worldvolumes of @xmath75 branes at time zero .",
    "the motion of the @xmath75 corresponds to multiplication of the coordinates of @xmath76 by @xmath77 .",
    "these configurations for generic @xmath30 preserve @xmath2 of the supersymmetries . if @xmath30 is a plane then we reproduce the giant graviton of @xcite which preserves @xmath1 of the supersymmetry",
    ". we can interpret the splitting @xmath70 in the following way .",
    "the momentum of the bps state is an element of @xmath78 and it can be represented as an antisymmetric matrix @xmath79 acting in @xmath71 .",
    "an antisymmetric matrix acting in an odd - dimensional space has at least one zero eigenvector . the preffered direction @xmath80 is generated by a vector annihilated by @xmath79 .",
    "the details for @xmath65 and @xmath66 are presented in section 5 .",
    "we have seen that there is a continuum of supersymmetric giant gravitons with the given momentum , parametrized by the holomorphic curves ( or just arbitrary curves , in the case of @xmath50 ) .",
    "one could think that this implies that there is a continuum of bps states with a given momentum on the cft side .",
    "of course , this conclusion is wrong . to find the degeneracy of the bps states one should study the giant gravitons quantum mechanically .",
    "classical supersymmetric solutions of the d - brane equations of motion corresponding to the giant gravitons are in fact superpositions of the large number of supersymmetric quantum states having nearly the same energy and momentum .",
    "let us think of the momentum @xmath11 as specifying an irreducible representation of the @xmath13-symmetry group ( essentially , a set of integers ) .",
    "what is the number of states with the given momentum @xmath11 ? on the cft side , we at least naively expect it to depend on @xmath11 and the number of colors @xmath21 : @xmath81  it is the number of primary operators transforming in a given representation of the r - symmetry group . on the supergravity side @xmath21 is proportional @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the tension of the probe brane ( the brane which makes the giant graviton ) and @xmath13 is the radius of the ads space .",
    "the quantity @xmath82 is in fact the only dimensionless parameter in the born - infeld action for the probe brane , if we forget about @xmath84-corrections .",
    "naively this implies that the number of states with the given momentum is a function of @xmath82 , which would agree with what we expect from cft .",
    "but one should remember that the born - infeld action is not enough to define a worldvolume theory on a d - brane .",
    "there are divergences which should be regularized by adding @xmath84 corrections .",
    "in fact , considering the full quantum theory on the d brane requires taking into account the degrees of freedom living in the bulk .",
    "either the degeneracy of the bps states of the d brane does not receive @xmath84 corrections , or the number of primary operators in cft depends on the coupling constant .",
    "we will not try to quantize the worldvolume theory of the giant graviton in our paper .",
    "but we want to consider a simple and well - known example in flat space where we can actually compute the degeneracy .",
    "classical bps configurations of the d - string .    consider type iib at weak coupling @xmath85 compactified on a circle @xmath86 of the radius @xmath87 .",
    "let us wrap @xmath88 on @xmath86 .",
    "let @xmath89 be the time , @xmath90 the coordinate on the circle , and @xmath91 , @xmath92 the coordinates in the noncompact directions .",
    "consider the following classical solution of the d - string equations of motion : @xmath93 this is the left moving wave .",
    "this solution preserves @xmath2 of the supersymmetry of type iib ( we review this fact in section 7 ) .",
    "it saturates the bps bound for a given momentum .",
    "indeed , the energy of the solution is equal to : @xmath94 where @xmath83 is the tension of the d - string .",
    "we have taken into account that @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "the momentum along the circle is : @xmath98 we see that the bps bound is saturated : @xmath99 quantum mechanically @xmath100 should be quantized and for each integer @xmath100 there is a finite number of states .",
    "let us briefly review how this happens .",
    "suppose that the coordinates are slowly varying on the worldsheet : @xmath101 \\end{array}\\ ] ] we will forget about fermions . consider the fourier decomposition of the worldsheet fields : @xmath102 the action can be rewritten in terms of the fourier modes : @xmath103\\ ] ] the hamiltonian is : @xmath104 where @xmath105 and @xmath106 is the momentum conjugate to @xmath107 , @xmath108 . in quantum mechanics",
    "@xmath109 and @xmath110 become creation / annihilation operators , @xmath111 } = -k\\delta_{k , k'}\\delta_{i , i'}$ ] .",
    "let us consider the states of the form : @xmath112 these states are annihilated by @xmath113 with negative @xmath114 .",
    "quasiclassically this means that the state is purely left moving .",
    "these are the bps states .",
    "the classical bps configurations given by ( [ leftmoving ] ) are superpositions of the large numbers of these quantum bps states .",
    "suppose that we start increasing the string coupling constant .",
    "when @xmath115 we can describe our d - string as a fundamental string of the dual type iib . in this limit",
    "the left - moving waves correspond to the bps states in the spectrum of the fundamental string which have been discovered by dabholkar and harvey @xcite .",
    "these states are the form @xmath116 where @xmath117 is related to the momentum @xmath118 and @xmath119 is the winding number ; in our case @xmath120 . the degeneracy of these states is @xmath121  the coefficient of @xmath122 in @xmath123 ( in fact there is more degeneracy because of the worldsheet fermions ) .",
    "the number of states with the given momentum @xmath100 is finite although rapidly growing with @xmath100 .    in this example , the degeneracy of states with the given momentum did not depend on @xmath124 .",
    "this is because the theory on the worldvolume was free .",
    "if we have added interactions , for example consider the d string living in the curved space then the spectrum would depend on @xmath125 where @xmath126 determines the curvature .",
    "if in addition these interactions were nonrenormalizable then the spectrum would also depend on the cutoff ( that is on @xmath84 ) .",
    "spinors in the spaces of the form ads times a sphere were studied in many papers @xcite . in this subsection",
    "we will briefly review this subject .",
    "first of all , let us remember what is the spin bundle . consider a manifold @xmath128 with a metric @xmath129",

    "@xmath134 comes equipped with the connection , which is defined as follows .",
    "the section of the spinor bundle is covariantly constant along the path @xmath143 if and only if @xmath138 is constant provided that we have chosen the field of tetrads in such a way that @xmath144 .",
    "this connection is called `` spin connection '' .",
    "it can be described in the following way .",

    "suppose that we have an embedding of manifolds @xmath150 , @xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 is even , both @xmath128 and @xmath154 have a spin structure .",
    "the structure group of @xmath155 is @xmath156 . in other words",
    ", we can define the field of tetrads in such a way that the first @xmath114 vectors @xmath157 belong to @xmath158 and the last @xmath153 of them belong to @xmath159 .",
    "this gives us an isomorphism @xmath160 however , one should remember that this isomorphism usually does not commute with the parallel transport .",
    "it is important for us to consider a special case with @xmath161 , @xmath162 , @xmath163 , @xmath164 .",
    "for example , we can take @xmath165 and @xmath166 . more generally , we assume that @xmath167 is the cone with the base @xmath168 .",
    "this means that the metric on @xmath167 can be written as follows : @xmath169 we can write a general expression for some components of the spin connection : @xmath170 where @xmath171 is tangent to @xmath168",
    ". suppose that @xmath172 is a covariantly constant spinor in @xmath173 satisfying @xmath174 and @xmath175 .",
    "then , the restriction of the covariantly constant spinor to @xmath176 satisfies the following equations : @xmath177 where @xmath178 are the coordinates on @xmath179 and @xmath180 are the coordinates on @xmath181 .",
    "these are the equations for covariantly constant spinors in @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath172 is not the only solution to the equations ( [ covariantlyconstant ] ) .",
    "one can see that @xmath182 is another solution .",
    "in fact , our spinor representation is reducible if considered as a representation of @xmath183 .",
    "the operator @xmath184 is the projector on the irreducible subspace .",
    "this gives us the following description of the killing spinors in @xmath127 : @xmath185 here we have assumed that both the ads and the sphere have euclidean signature .",
    "the formula for the minkowski ads times the euclidean sphere is the same except for one should skip @xmath186 .",
    "first of all , let us summarize already introduced notations and introduce some more .",
    "we have embedded @xmath187 , @xmath188 , @xmath21 has a complex structure @xmath189 , which is an operator in @xmath26 with @xmath190 satisfying certain integrability conditions . for our application",
    ", we can take @xmath23 and @xmath191 , or @xmath192 and @xmath193conifold .",
    "we are considering a holomorphic surface @xmath194 , @xmath195 .",
    "in this situation , it is natural to consider the following obects :    [ cols=\"^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     notice that the orthogonal complement to @xmath196 in @xmath27 has real dimension two . in this subsection",
    "we will prove that the component of @xmath33 orthogonal to @xmath196 is proportional to @xmath197 : @xmath198 we will also find that the component of @xmath33 parallel to @xmath196 is proportional to @xmath199 ( in other words , it is orthogonal to @xmath200 ) .",

    "this vector should be orthogonal to @xmath197 , and also orthogonal to @xmath29 ( because @xmath202 is closed under @xmath189 ) .",
