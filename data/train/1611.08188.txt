    "thermodynamics and statistical mechanics have been mutually inspiring fields of research for over 100 years .",
    "recently , the formulation of thermodynamic laws for the description of small scale nonequilibrium systems in contact with heat and work reservoirs has deepened and extended our understanding of thermodynamics and its relation to microscopic laws .",

    ", we apply stochastic thermodynamics to a prototype model of statistical mechanics , namely a linear chain of ising spins which is at its ends in contact with heat reservoirs at different temperatures .",
    "one interest of our analysis is that , in contrast with most models studied so far in the context of stochastic thermodynamics , the internal dynamics in the chain is supposed to be microcanonical , in the sense that it is energy conserving .",
    "nevertheless , the standard formalism of stochastic thermodynamics applies and one of its basic predictions , the so - called the fluctuation theorem , will be verified .",
    "furthermore , the system can be mapped onto a model for particle transport , namely the symmetric exclusion process . in this respect",
    ", we note that , with a proper interpretation of the boundary conditions , the system can function as a small scale thermal engine .",
    "we verify another prediction of stochastic thermodynamics , namely the universality of efficiency at maximum power .",

    "we define the model and its different interpretations in terms of energy and particle transport as well as reviewing the relation with the symmetric exclusion process . in section [ sec : efficiency ]",
    "we discuss its use as a heat engine and compute its efficiency at maximum showing that it shares some universal features . in section",

    "this formalism can be applied without modification for stochastic systems with ",
    "internal \" transitions , provided they satisfy detailed balance with respect to a microcanonical distribution rather than the canonical or grand - canonical distribution that apply to rates describing the contact with the reservoirs . hence only transitions are possible between states of same energy and these rates are equal , as the corresponding microcanonical probabilities are equal . with this proviso",

    "the model is closely related to that of particle - energy transport considered in @xcite , with the difference that two particles can not occupy the same site , see also @xcite . to make the connection with a thermal engine we include , in addition to the above prescription , a new ingredient such that particle motion implies both a particle and energy flux .",
