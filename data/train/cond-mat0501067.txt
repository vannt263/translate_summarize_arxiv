    "this is in contrast to the well known random graphs introduced by erds and rnyi , whose degree distribution is poissonian @xcite . due to the absence of a characteristic value for the nodal degree these new class of networks",

    "traffic system usually involve queues and in the simplest information traffic system consisting of a random information input and a buffer shows a phase transition behavior when the buffer capacity is infinite . when the mean input rate is smaller compared to maximum possible output rate , the average accumulation of information at the buffer is finite and this is called the ` free ' phase . as the mean input rate of information",

    "the role of the node at the top of the hierarchy is crucial for congestion .",

    "an oriented square lattice of size @xmath17 placed on the @xmath18 plane is the network in our model : the lattice sites are the nodes and lattice bonds are the links of the network .",

    "similarly all nodes on the bottom row at @xmath21 are considered as sinks where packets are delivered and therefore disappear from the system . though the data packets are distinguishable a packet is delivered at any arbitrary sink . in general each of @xmath22 nodes is a router which receive , store and forward packets along the preferred direction .",

    "reported below we have used @xmath26 .    the total number @xmath27 of data packets in the network at time @xmath8 is called the ` load ' which fluctuates with time but maintains a steady mean value @xmath28 in the stationary free - flow state ( fig . 2 and 3 ) .",
    "for a posting rate @xmath29 the system switches over to a congested phase and the @xmath30 increases indefinitely .",
    "since packets are moving into the system a rate larger than the outflow rate , packets simply pile up in the system and no flow balance is attained .",
    "the variation of @xmath28 with @xmath0 is studied .",
    "different packets take different travel times , to reach their destinations .",
    "the probability distribution of these travel times is also measured for different @xmath0 values .",
    "the nodal queue length distribution of the network is studied for different posting rates .",
    "the fluctuation of mean load per node or the mean queue length @xmath31 is observed to have a self - similar fluctuation as shown in fig . 2 for @xmath32 and @xmath9 .",
    "in the fig .",
    "2(a ) @xmath12 has been plotted with time @xmath8 over an interval of length @xmath33 . a small boxed region over a time interval of @xmath34 from fig .",

    "2(b ) has been zoomed to fig .",
    "2(c ) using a vertical magnification 3.48 having the same size as of 2(b ) .",
    "it is evident from the three plots that apart from the stochastic noise present in the system the fluctuation of mean load is self - similar .",
    "in addition the fluctuation of mean load per node becomes stronger and more correlated when @xmath0 approaches the critical posting rate @xmath11 .",
    "for small @xmath0 value the load fluctuates around an average value and the fluctuations are also small .",
    "it means that the correlation time is short , that is state of the system at a certain time step has very little effect on the states of the system a few time steps away . as @xmath36 the fluctuations in the mean",
    "load becomes increasingly stronger and it spreads in a wider region indicating higher correlation in the system . near @xmath11 a particular state of the system naturally influences the states of the system far away from it . in fig .",
    "3 we plot @xmath12 for four different posting rates @xmath37 and 0.96 over an interval of length @xmath38 time units and for the system size @xmath9 .",
    "the width of fluctuation @xmath39 increases as posting rate increases and also the fluctuation becomes more and more correlated .     on systems of sizes",
    "@xmath40 and 64 for posting rates 0.95 , 0.97 and 0.99 .",
    "the scaled plot fits nicely with a log - normal function .",
    ", width=245 ]    when @xmath0 is very small the number of packet posted per time step is also very small and the system can deliver it very quickly to the destination .",
    "no queue could be formed on the nodes and a packet need not wait in any node while traveling .",
    "this is a free - flow phase .",
    "but when the posting rate @xmath0 increases , slowly queues are formed and a packet had to wait in queues while traveling and this waiting - time started contributing to the travel time of a packet .",
    "but up to certain @xmath0 value the queue length and hence the waiting - time at the nodes fluctuates around an average value , i.e , still the average delivery rate of the system and the average posting rate is equal and there is no growing accumulation of packets in the system . at this stage queues",
    "are formed on the nodes and average length of the queues increases with @xmath0 but that average value is not growing with time . but as @xmath36 posting rate becomes equal to the maximum delivery rate ( capacity ) of the system and beyond that there will be growing accumulation of packets in the system indicating congestion or jammed phase .    though exactly at @xmath41 the balance of inflow and outflow fluxes of data packet currents is maintained it is observed that no stationary state is attained at this critical point .",
    "this is because not all nodes of the bottom row at @xmath42 receive exactly one data packet each at every time unit , by fluctuation some nodes receive two and some other nodes do not receive any packet at all . since a node even if received two data packets can deliver at most one packet , some packets must have to stay back in the system ultimately leading to a global congestion .",
    "how the mean load per node increases with time at the non - stationary state of @xmath43 ?",
    "it is observed that the variation is parabolic i.e. , @xmath44 .",
    "however for @xmath29 the growth is linear in time : @xmath45 .",
    "the time averaged load per node @xmath46 in the free - flow stationary state is calculated for different values of the posting rates @xmath0 and are plotted in fig .",
    "4(a ) for @xmath47 . for small values of @xmath0",
    "the load is small and increases slowly .",
    "however when @xmath0 approaches @xmath11 the rate of increase is very fast and diverges .",
    "this is seen more explicitly in fig .",
    "4(b ) where @xmath46 is plotted with @xmath48 on a double logarithmic scale and a straight line is obtained for @xmath0 close to @xmath11 .",
    "the slope of the straight line is 0.98 , implying that the load may vary as : @xmath49    queue length distribution @xmath50 of the system which is analogous to jam size distribution in the highway network gives a better understanding of the packet flow scenario .",
    "compared to single - queue theories , here we have many interacting queues in which at each time step a single packet can hop from any queue to any of the two neighboring queues .",
    "thus here apart from the source nodes all other nodes are placed equivalently .",
    "they all have only two neighboring nodes as source of data packets . in fig .",
    "5 we show the plot of @xmath50 vs. @xmath51 for @xmath52 and 0.99 for @xmath47 on a semi - log scale indicating that the intermediate region of the distribution follow the exponentially decaying distribution @xmath53 in general . it has been observed that the dependence @xmath54 is followed very nicely .",
    "the average queue length @xmath55 is also measured as a function of the @xmath56 co - ordinate and found to vary as @xmath57 independent of @xmath56 except over a small region near the top level .",
    "the travel time @xmath58 of a data packet is defined as the time spent by the packet in the system which is obviously the difference between the delivery and posting times .",
    "each data packet is given a label and with each node a queue list is associated containing the labels of the data packets in this queue .",
    "if the queue length at a node is greater than @xmath1 then first @xmath1 packets from the front of the queue are deleted and the queue is shifted @xmath1 location to the front .",
    "each of these @xmath1 packets are then randomly routed to one of the ll or lr node .",
    "such a packet is placed at the end of the queue in the new node by the fifo rule .",
    "intuitively it is easy to understand that for very low posting rates @xmath59 every data packet makes a hop at every time instant and therefore all @xmath58 values are same and equal to @xmath13 . consequently the @xmath60 .",
    "however as @xmath0 increases the queue lengths become larger , as a result travel time increases and its distribution gains a finite width .",
    "we have studied in detail the distribution of travel times and its dependence on @xmath0 and @xmath13 and @xmath61 is observed to follow a combined scaling form over @xmath0 and @xmath13 as : @xmath62\\ ] ] the scaling function @xmath63 is seen to follow a log - normal function like : @xmath64     vs. @xmath8 on a semi - log scale and ( b ) power spectrum @xmath65 vs. @xmath66 on a double log scale for the posting rates : @xmath24 0.96 ( dot - dashed ) , 0.97 ( dashed ) and 0.98 ( solid ) lines for a system size @xmath13 = 64 . ,",
    "the fluctuation of mean queue length per node @xmath67 with time depends on the posting rate . in the free - flow stationary state",
    "the autocorrelation function of @xmath67 is defined as : @xmath68 fourier transform of the autocorrelation function @xmath69 is known as the spectral density or power spectrum @xmath65 defined as @xmath70 for a time series which has no temporal correlation , plot of @xmath65 against @xmath66 is independent of @xmath66 . for some other time data series , the power spectrum may vary as a power law : @xmath71 . in this case",
    "the spectral exponent @xmath72 characterizes the nature of persistence , @xmath73 indicates zero correlation associated with brownian motion , @xmath74 indicates positive correlation and persistence and @xmath75 represents negative correlation and anti - persistence .    the autocorrelation @xmath69 function of the mean queue length in the stationary state is plotted in fig .",
    "7(a ) on a semi - log scale up to @xmath8=8192 for three values of the posting rate @xmath76 and 0.98 calculated on a system size @xmath47 .",
    "fourier transformations of these correlation functions are done using ` _ xmgrace _ ' and the power spectrum @xmath65 is plotted with @xmath66 on a double logarithmic scale in fig .",

    "the intermediate regimes of the curves are quite straight indicating a power law variation of the power spectrum : @xmath77 . from fig .",
    "7(b ) we measure the slopes are all nearly same and @xmath78 indicating @xmath3 noise near critical posting rate @xmath11 irrespective of the precise value of the posting rate .",
    "similar autocorrelation functions and associated power spectrum are also calculated for the fluctuation of the length of a single queue @xmath23 .",
    "the power spectrum is also observed to follow a power law with the spectral exponent value nearly equal to one .",

    "however unlike the previous model , the critical rate @xmath81 as @xmath82 .",
    "this is because a large number of packets simply pile up at the middle line for all values of the posting rates greater than @xmath82 .",
