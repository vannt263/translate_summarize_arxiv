    "the total amplitude factorizes into a hard contribution , computable from perturbative qcd , and a soft matrix element which requires a non - perturbative treatment . from the point of view of chiral symmetry breaking a particularly interesting process is provided by the @xmath7 transition form factor . for real photons its normalization is fixed by the anomalous breaking of chiral symmetry by the @xmath8 decay .",
    "in addition , in the limit of large photon virtualities , factorization allows us to define the leading - twist pion distribution amplitude as a low energy matrix element whose normalization is fixed by the pion weak - decay constant , a spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking feature of the qcd vacuum .",
    "it seems obvious that such a process offers a unique opportunity not only to learn about the interplay between high and low energies , but also to understand the relation between the spontaneous and the anomalous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "radiative logarithmic corrections to the pion distribution amplitude ( pda ) can be easily implemented through the qcd evolution equations  @xcite , which yield for @xmath9 the asymptotic wave function of the form @xmath10 . moreover ,",
    "the pion transition form factor has been measured by the cello  @xcite and , recently , the cleo collaborations  @xcite .",
    "a theoretical analysis of pda based on these data and light - cone sum rules has been undertaken  @xcite , showing that at @xmath11  gev pda is neither asymptotic , nor possesses the double - hump structure @xcite proposed in early works @xcite .",
    "gev , the possible admixture of the chernyak - zhitnitsky wave function is rather small ]    the pion distribution amplitude has been evaluated with qcd sum rules  @xcite , in standard  @xcite ( only the second @xmath12-moment ) and transverse lattice approaches  @xcite , and in chiral quark models  @xcite . in chiral quark models the results are not always compatible to each other , and even their interpretation has not always been the same .",
    "while in same cases there are problems with chiral symmetry and proper normalization  @xcite , in other cases @xcite it is not clear how to associate the scale at which the model is defined , necessary to define the starting point for the qcd evolution .",
    "nevertheless , there is a precise way to identify the low energy scale , @xmath13 , at which the model is defined , namely the one at which the quarks carry @xmath14 of the total momentum  @xcite .",
    "the fact that several calculations  @xcite produce a pda strongly resembling the asymptotic form suggests that their working scale is already large , and the subsequent qcd evolution becomes unnecessary , or numerically insignificant .",
    "this also tacitly assumes that these models already incorporate the qcd radiative corrections .    in the present paper",
    "we compute the pion distribution amplitude and the pion light - cone wave function within the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model  @xcite in a semibosonized form using the pauli - villars ( pv ) regularization method  @xcite .",

    "although factorization holds beyond doubt in qcd , it is far from obvious that any of the regularization schemes used to make a low - energy model well defined is compatible with factorization .",
    "in addition , we want to determine what is the low - energy scale , @xmath13 , the model corresponds to .",
    "here we obtain it with help of the analysis of pda and compare it to the @xmath13 obtained in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) from the corresponding parton distribution function of the pion ( pdf ) .",
    "to a large extent our treatment of pda parallels the calculation of pdf carried out in previous works  @xcite .",
    "there , it has been argued that for inclusive processes , such as in deep inelastic scattering , by far the most convenient regularization scheme is the pauli - villars ( pv ) method .",
    "such a regularization allows the extraction of the leading - twist contribution to the forward virtual compton amplitude which possesses proper support and normalization .",
    "the relevance of regularization in chiral quark models should not be underestimated ; it is not evident what is the most convenient way to cut - off high energies in such a way that most features of qcd are retained .",

    "both results are independent of the particular form of the pauli - villars regulators used . after the qcd evolution of the pion distribution amplitude to the experimentally accessible region",
    "we find a result still rather far away from the asymptotic form , @xmath237 , but in a good agreement with the analysis of the experimental data from the cleo collaboration . we can determine the working momentum scale for the model to be @xmath4  mev , a rather low value .",
    "moreover , the scale @xmath13 obtained in this work is compatible , within experimental uncertainties , to the value obtained from the previous analysis of the parton distribution functions , carried out within exactly the same model . at the scale",
    "@xmath13 the quarks carry all the momentum of the pion . our value obtained for the second transverse moment of the pion light - cone wave function , @xmath238 ,",
    "becomes , after the qcd evolution , not far from the estimates based on the qcd sum rules .",
    "finally , we have also derived a model relation which binds the departure of the pion distribution amplitude from its asymptotic value to an integral involving the pion quark distribution function .",
    "the relation , specific to the feature of our model that at the scale @xmath13 both the pda and pdf are constant and equal to unity , has been successfully checked against the available data .",
