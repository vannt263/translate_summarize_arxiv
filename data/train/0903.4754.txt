    "moreover , the lie algebra of the isotropy group @xmath83 of @xmath32 at the point @xmath84 coincides with @xmath85 .    select a longest restricted root @xmath20 and take the shortest closed geodesic @xmath86\\to m$ ] defined by @xmath87 .",

    "this in turn implies that the value of @xmath2 on the midpoint locus @xmath123 is equal to @xmath110 since @xmath124 consists of points that are antipodes of @xmath120 in some helgason sphere .",
    "hence we have proved that @xmath125 for every @xmath24 in @xmath117 as we wanted .",

    "a helgason sphere in @xmath0 is nothing but a projective line .",
    "let @xmath2 be a smooth function on @xmath0 such that @xmath3 vanishes . then arguing as in the proof above we see that the restrictions of @xmath2 to the projective lines are odd functions .",
