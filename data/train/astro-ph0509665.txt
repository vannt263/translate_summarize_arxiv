    "although the currently favoured  model has proven to be remarkably successful on large scales ( cf .",
    "spergel et al . 2003 ) , recent high - resolution  simulations seem to be in contradiction with observation on sub - galactic scales : the cdm `` crisis '' is far from being over .",
    "suggested solutions to this include the introduction of self - interactions into collisionless  simulations ( e.g. spergel  & steinhardt 2000 ) , replacing cold dark matter with warm dark matter ( e.g. knebe  2002 ) or non - standard modifications to an otherwise unperturbed cdm power spectrum ( e.g. bumpy power spectra , little , knebe  & islam 2003 ) .",
    "some of the problems , as for instance the overabundance of satellites , can be resolved with such modifications but none of the proposed solutions have been able to rectify _ all _ shortcomings of  simultaneously .",
    "therefore , alternative solutions are unquestionably worthy of exploration , one of which is to abandon dark matter completely and to adopt the equations of modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ; milgrom 1983 ; bekenstein  & milgrom 1984 ) .",
    ".model parameters . in all cases a value for the hubble parameter of @xmath4 was employed . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we adapted our cosmological  code ` amiga ` ( knebe , green  & binney 2001 ) to account for the effects of mond in the following way . in an  code",
    "one usually integrates the ( comoving ) equations of motion    @xmath5    which are completed by poisson s equation    @xmath6    in these equations @xmath7 is the comoving coordinate , @xmath8 the canonical momentum , @xmath9 the divergence operator ( @xmath10 the nabla operator ) with respect to @xmath11 and @xmath12 the _ peculiar acceleration field in comoving coordinates_. we now need to modify these ( comoving ) equations to account for mond .",
    "sanders  & mcgaugh ( 2002 ) showed that the relation between the newtonian @xmath13 and mondian @xmath14 acceleration ( in proper coordinates ) can be written as    @xmath15    where we already faciliated milgrom s interpolation function @xmath16 ( milgrom 1983 ) and @xmath17 is the fundamental acceleration of the mond theory .",
    "if we further assume that mond only affects peculiar acceleration ( in proper coordinates ) , i.e. @xmath18 , the recipe for adding the mond formalism to an  code reads as follows : ( 1 ) solve eq .",
    "( [ poissonpec ] ) using ` amiga `  which gives the comoving @xmath19 , ( 2 ) calculate the peculiar acceleration in proper coordinates @xmath20 , ( 3 ) use eq .",
    "( [ ggn ] ) to calculate @xmath21 from @xmath22 , ( 4 ) transfer @xmath21 back to @xmath23 , and ( 5 ) use @xmath24 rather than @xmath19 for the equations of motion  ( [ eompec ] ) . for a more elaborate discussion of the assumptions upon which this scheme is based and a more detailed derivation of the formulae presented here",
    "we refer the reader to knebe  & gibson ( 2004 ) .",
    "our suite of simulations now consists of a standard  model , an open , low-@xmath0 model with the same @xmath1 as  ( ocbm ) , and an open , low-@xmath0 model with mond and adjusted @xmath1 ( ocbmond ) , and their physical parameters are summarized in table  [ parameter ] .",
    "we simulated @xmath25 particles in a box of side length 32  from redshift @xmath26 to @xmath2 .",
    "gravitationally bound objects were identified using the ` amiga ` s native halo finder ` ahf ` described in great detail in gill , knebe  & gibson ( 2004 ) .",
    "the first intriguing result can be viewed in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] where we show a projection of the whole simulation with each individual particle color - coded according to the local density at redshift @xmath2 .",
    "this figure demonstrates that the mond model exhibits fairly similar features in terms of the locations of high density peaks , filaments and the large - scale structure when being compared to both the standard  model and the ocbm simulation .",
    "one should bear in mind though that the ocbmond simulation was started with a much lower @xmath27 normalisation than the other two run indicating a faster growth of structures in mond universes .",
    "this result is supported by fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] ( left panel ) where the abundance evolution of gravitationally bound objects more massive than @xmath28  is shown .",
    "moreover , this figure also poses a serious problem for cosmological mondian structure formation . due to the increased formation rate of objects we had to lower the amplitude of the primordial density perturbations",
    "this in turn leads to a strong deficiency of gravitionally bound structures at redshifts @xmath29 , quite in contrast to observations where we find galaxies out to redshifts of @xmath30 ( shioya  2005 ) .",
    "[ figure2 ] ( right panel ) also shows the spherically averaged density profile of the most massive halo in all three models along with fits ( thin solid lines ) to a navarro , frenk  & white ( 1997 ) profile @xmath31 .",
    "we observe that even for the ocbmond model the data is equally well described by the functional form of a nfw profile ( at least out to the virial radius indicated by the respective vertical lines ) .",
    "however , the central density of that halo in the ocbmond model is lower than in  and especially in ocbm .",
    "a quantitative analysis further shows that the concentration of the ocbmond halo is about a factor of four smaller than in the  model .",
    "( left ) and the density profile for the most massive halo in all three models ( right).,width=377 ]",
    "even though it is possible to match a cosmological simulation including the effects of mond to the standard  structure formation scenario at redshift @xmath2 there are serious deviations at higher redshifts .",
    "we conclude that the most distinctive feature of a mondian universe is the late epoch of galaxy formation . however , the density profiles of gravitationally bound objects still follow the universal nfw shape .",
