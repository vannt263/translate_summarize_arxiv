    "over the past several years the first picture of the cosmic evolution of the global star - formation rate has been sketched ( e.g. giavalisco et al .",
    "2004 ; dickinson et al .",
    "this is a truly remarkable achievement .",
    "however , there is considerable work to be done .",
    "the ultimate goal of course is to understand the astrophysical processes that drove the evolution of star formation and to relate these processes to the building of galaxies , the fueling of active galactic nuclei , and the development of large - scale structure .",
    "this will require detailed and statistically robust comparisons of the fundamental properties of star forming galaxies as a function of redshift .",
    "one obstacle has been that our understanding of the evolution of star formation has until recently been a patchwork quilt that relied on different techniques ( each with their own selection biases and systematic methodological uncertainties ) over different redshift ranges .",
    "for example , our most detailed information about star formation in the early universe has been provided by the large sample of ( rest - frame ) uv - selected lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) .",
    "ironically , the properties of the uv - selected galaxy population have been much more fully characterized at z @xmath2 3 than at @xmath8 0 ( e.g. shapley et al . 2001 ; papovich et al .",
    "2001 ; giavalisco 2002 - hereafter s01 , p01 , and g02 respectively ) .",
    "this situation has changed dramatically with the successful launch of the _ galaxy evolution explorer _ ( galex ) . its all - sky imaging survey",
    "( ais ) and medium imaging survey ( mis ) will generate uv - selected samples of a million relatively nearby star forming galaxies ( martin et al 2004 ) with optical photometry and spectroscopy from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss - york et al",
    ". 2000 ) .",
    "one of the first major results from the galex mission is the measurement of the evolution of the galaxy ultraviolet luminosity function from @xmath8 0 to 4 ( arnouts et al .",
    "2004 ; schiminovich et al . , 2004 ) .",
    "as emphasized in these papers , the rate of cosmic evolution in the ultraviolet galaxy population is strongest at the highest luminosities .",
    "in particular , the co - moving space density of galaxies with far - ultraviolet luminosities @xmath9 increases by a factor of @xmath230 from @xmath10 = 0 to 1 , and by additional factor of @xmath24 out to @xmath10 = 3 .",
    "thus , it is clearly important to identify and study the most ultraviolet- luminous galaxies in the relatively nearby universe , and then compare the properties of these ( rare ) objects to their counterparts at high - redshift ( most notably , the lbgs ) . in the present paper",
    "we use the results from the initial matching of the galex and sdss data to initiate such an investigation .",
    "our goal is to define a sample of local galaxies that overlap significantly in uv luminosity with lbgs .",
    "however , within this range , the number of local galaxies is falling very steeply with luminosity .",
    "for this reason , we have chosen to define a sample of `` ultraviolet luminous galaxies '' ( uvlgs ) as having fuv luminosities ( @xmath11 at 1530  ) @xmath12.=70 km sec@xmath13 mpc@xmath13 , @xmath14=0.3 , and @xmath15=0.7 throughout this paper . ]",
    "this defining luminosity is roughly half way between the characteristic ( @xmath16 ) value for the present day uv galaxy luminosity function ( @xmath17 - wyder et al .",
    "2004 ) and that of the lbg population at @xmath8 3 ( @xmath18 - g02 ; arnouts et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "we started by matching the galex ir0.2 and sdss data release one catalogs ( as detailed in seibert et al .",
    "we then selected those objects spectroscopically classified as galaxes by the sdss , specifically excluding objects spectroscopically classified qsos ( or type 1 seyfert galaxies ) .",
    "finally , we have inspected the spectra and removed a few weak type 1 agn that had been misclassified by sdss .",
    "this gives us a sample of 74 galaxies , spread rather uniformly in redshift between 0.1 and 0.3 ( median @xmath10 = 0.19 ) .",
    "these galaxies are indeed rare : the co - moving space density of uvlgs at the current epoch is only @xmath19 mpc@xmath20 , several hundred times smaller than the co - moving density of lbg at @xmath213 .",
    "the sdss data by themselves provide a host of important galaxy parameters ( abazajian et al .",
    "2003 ; stoughton et al .",
    "we have used the sdss data release two archive to retrieve the petrosian magnitudes and seeing - deconvolved half - light radii in the @xmath22 and @xmath23 bands , the concentration index @xmath24 in the r - band , and the redshift for all the uvlgs . for the uvlgs in the sdss `` main '' galaxy sample ( strauss et al .",
    "2002 ) , we have used the value - added catalogs described at http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/sdss/ to retrieve estimates of gas - phase metallicities , emission - line widths , age - sensitive 4000   break amplitudes , emission - line ratios , and classifications ( agn vs. star forming ) .",
    "see kauffmann et al ( 2003a , b ) , brinchmann et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , and tremonti et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for details . for the other uvlgs we have used the methodology described in tremonti et al .",
    "( 2004 ) to measure fluxes and widths of the emission - lines .",
    "the combined galex plus sdss 7-band photometry has been used in conjunction with an extensive grid of models to estimate the stellar masses , fuv extinctions , and star formation rates .",
    "see salim et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for details .",
    "in figure 1 we show a plot of the far - uv luminosity @xmath25 _ vs. _ the half - light radius in the sdss @xmath22-band ( @xmath26 ) . for the redshift range of the uvlgs",
    ", the sdss @xmath22-band covers the rest - frame range @xmath22700 to 3200  band , where the contribution by young stars should dominate ( given the high specific star formation rates discussed below ) .",
    "the uvlgs span a broad range in size , from relatively compact systems with radii of a kpc ( similar to lbgs - ferguson et al .",
    "2004 ) to very large galaxies with radii of over 10 kpc .",
    "this implies a correspondingly large range in far - uv surface brightness ( @xmath27 - figure 2 ) .",
    "the uvlgs overlap the range of @xmath27 of typical lbgs ( @xmath28 to @xmath29 kpc@xmath30 ) , but most are significantly fainter .",
    "figure 2 shows that there is a strong inverse correlation between surface brightness and mass .",
    "while it is clear that a continuum of properties is present , the wide range of physical properties makes it instructive to subdivide our sample into two categories : `` large '' ( @xmath31 kpc@xmath30 ) and `` compact '' ( @xmath32 kpc@xmath30 ) .",
    "this choice not only divides the sample into two subsets with roughly equal numbers , but it also divides the sample in galaxy mass at the critical value ( @xmath33 ) where kauffmann et al .",
    "( 2003c ) find that the sdss galaxy population abruptly transitions from _ primarily _ low mass , low density , low concentration , disk dominated galaxies with young stellar populations to high mass , high density , high concentration , bulge dominated systems with old stellar populations .",
    "the compact , high surface - brightness uvlgs are typically low - mass galaxies ( @xmath34 to @xmath35 ) .",
    "this mass range is very similar to that of lbgs ( s01,p01,g02 ) .",
    "these compact uvlgs are larger , more luminous , and more massive than local hii galaxies ( telles & terlevich 1997 ) and overlap the high mass range of compact galaxies found at higher redshift ( 0.4 @xmath36 1 ) in the hubble deep field ( phillips et . al 1997 ) .",
    "the large , low surface - brightness uvlgs are significantly more massive ( @xmath37 to @xmath38 ) .",
    "the high - mass galaxies in the sdss that do have a significant population of young stars have the low concentrations typical of disk galaxies ( @xmath39 2.6 ) , and this is the case for the large uvlgs ( 90 % of which have @xmath39 2.6 ) .",
    "the large uvlgs have typical values of effective stellar surface mass densities @xmath40 to @xmath41 kpc@xmath30 .",
    "this is about a factor of three lower than average for comparably massive late type galaxies ( see figure 14 in kauffmann et al 2003c ) .",
    "these uvlgs are corresponding larger than average late type galaxies of the same mass ( shen et al .",
    "these results are not surprising , since kauffmann et al .",
    "( 2003c ) showed that at fixed galaxy mass , sdss galaxies with lower @xmath42 ( and thus larger radii ) have younger stellar populations .",
    "the typical values for the fuv extinction in uvlgs are modest : @xmath43 0.5 to 2 magnitudes .",
    "this range is similar to that of a nuv - selected sample of galaxies that is representative of the local galex population ( buat et al .",
    "2004 ) , as well as that of lbgs ( s01,p01 ) . adopting a kroupa ( 2001 ) initial mass function , the typical estimated star formation rates for the uvlgs are @xmath2 3 to 30 @xmath3 year@xmath13 ( or @xmath2 5 to 50 @xmath3 year@xmath13 adopting the historically standard salpeter initial mass function ) .",
    "these star formation rates overlap the range spanned by lbgs ( s01 , p01 , g02 ) .    in figure 3",
    "we show that the _ specific _ star formation rate ( @xmath44 ) is a strong function of the far - uv surface brightness .",
    "the compact , high surface brightness uvlgs have typical values of @xmath45 to @xmath46 year@xmath13 , compared to @xmath47 to @xmath48 year@xmath13 for the large low surface brightness uvlgs .",
    "of course the specific star formation rate is roughly the inverse of the time it would take to form the present galaxy mass at the present star formation rate . thus , the large uvlgs are ( in the mean ) forming stars at a rate similar to their past rate averaged over a hubble time .",
    "in contrast , the compact uvlgs have a typical `` galaxy - building time '' of only 1 to 2 gigayear .",
    "thus , they are `` starburst '' systems .",
    "the _ most _ compact uvlgs ( @xmath49 kpc@xmath30 ) have galaxy - building times of only 0.1 to 1 gyr , very similar to the corresponding timescales in lbgs ( s01,p01,g02 ) .",
    "salim et al . ( 2004 ) and brinchmann et al .",
    "( 2004 ) have shown that the specific star formation rates in galaxies correlate strongly with the fuv - optical colors and the 4000   break amplitude ( d4000 ) , respectively .",
    "this is true for the uvlgs .",
    "the large uvlgs have intermediate colors ( @xmath6 2 to 3 ) and 4000   break strengths ( d4000 @xmath2 1.2 . to 1.7 ) , while the compact uvlgs have the blue colors ( @xmath6 0.5 to 2 ) and small 4000   break strengths ( d4000 @xmath2 1.0 to 1.3 ) of very young stellar populations ( e.g. kauffmann et al 2003a ) .",
    "the uv - optical colors of the compact uvlgs are very similar to those of lbgs ( s01,p01,g02 ) .",
    "the metallicities in the ionized gas in the uvlgs are typical for sdss galaxies of the corresponding stellar mass ( tremonti et al .",
    "2004 ) : the large ( massive ) uvlgs have oxygen abundances of several times solar , while the compact ( less massive ) uvlgs span a broad range in metallicity from @xmath230% solar to several times solar .",
    "we note that the `` strong - line '' methods like those used by tremonti et al .",
    "to estimate metallicity are known to yield systematically higher metallicities than direct techniques ( kennicutt , bresolin , & garnett 2003 ) .",
    "pettini & pagel ( 2004 ) have recently recalibrated the `` [ oiii]/[nii ] '' strong line metallicity indicator . using their calibration",
    ", the uvlg metallicities would be roughly solar for the large uvlgs and @xmath230% solar to solar for the compact uvlgs .",
    "these latter metallicities are similar to estimates for lbgs ( pettini et al . 2001 ; shapley et al . 2004 ) .",
    "typical emission - line velocity dispersions range from 50 to 150 km sec@xmath13 , with little dependence on galaxy mass .",
    "these are similar to values in lbgs ( pettini et al . 2001 ) . using these velocity dispersions and the u - band half - light radii",
    "we have computed dynamical masses ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "these agree with the stellar masses to within a typical factor of three .",
    "we have used the emission - line flux ratios [ oiii]/h@xmath51 vs. [ nii]/h@xmath52 to identify uvlgs in which a type 2 agn is making a significant contribution to the emission - line spectrum ( see kauffmann et al .",
    "we find that agn are present in 35% of the large uvlgs , and in 15% of the compact uvlgs ( the stronger emission lines produced by the more intense star formation makes the presence of an agn more difficult to detect in the compact uvlgs ) . the great majority ( 83% ) of the agn",
    "would be classified by kauffmann et al . as `` composite '' systems",
    "in which the observed emission - lines are contributed by a combination of an agn and o stars .",
    "the high rate of agn in uvlgs is not surprising given the link between strong agn and star formation in the population of massive galaxies in the sdss ( kauffmann et al .",
    "the large uvlgs have specific star formation rates sufficient to build their stellar mass over a hubble time .",
    "thus , they are not starburst systems . instead they owe their high uv luminosities ( high star formation rates ) to their relatively large masses .",
    "these systems appear to be the tail of the distribution of the normal sdss high - mass galaxy population , extending to high star formation rates , low stellar surface mass densities , large radii , low concentrations , and ( by implication ) high gas - mass fractions .",
    "that is , these appear to be among the most massive late type galaxies in the current epoch .",
    "they are rare objects : comparably massive galaxies today are primarily old , gas - poor , bulge - dominated systems ( kauffmann et al .",
    "2003c ) .",
    "in contrast , the compact uvlgs overlap the properties of the lyman break galaxies in all respects considered in this paper ( see table 1 ) . by definition",
    ", they have similar uv luminosities .",
    "they have sizes , surface brightnesses , uv extinctions , and implied star formation rates that all overlap those of the lbgs .",
    "they have similar stellar masses , velocity dispersions , and gas - phase metallcities as lbgs .",
    "their rest - frame uv - optical spectral energy distributions are similar to those of lbgs .",
    "finally , they are forming stars at a rate sufficient to form their present stellar mass in typically 1 to 2 gigayear .",
    "the compact uvlgs are clearly systems undergoing starbursts , and a relatively low duty cycle for such bursts presumably contributes to their relative rarity today . since the compact uvlgs do appear similar to the lbgs , these `` living fossils '' may provide an opportunity for a detailed _ local _ investigation of the same physical processes that occurred in typical star forming galaxies in the early universe .",
