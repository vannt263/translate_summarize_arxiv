    "the breaking of the @xmath0 symmetry is an operator relation that remains valid even when the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry is restored .",
    "however , whether its effect on the @xmath2 mass survives even when chiral symmetry is restored is a phenomenological question that has caught the interest of many researchers @xcite .",
    "the question has recently been revived as the rhic data on two pion bose - einstein correlation at @xmath3 gev au+au collision seems to suggest the quenching of the @xmath2 mass in medium @xcite .",
    "its partial quenching in nuclear medium is also of great interest as such effects could be probed in finer detail in nuclear target experiments @xcite .",
    "the restoration of @xmath0 symmetry will depend on two important ingredients ; its relation to chiral symmetry breaking and the effects from topological configurations .",
    "how the former and latter contribute to the @xmath4-point correlation functions have been clarified in references @xcite and @xcite . combining both effects",
    ", it was shown@xcite that in the chiral limit , with @xmath5 flavors , the symmetry will effectively be restored in correlation functions composed of up to @xmath6 points @xcite .",
    "this means , for example , that for @xmath7 , @xmath0 symmetry will be effectively restored in the two - point functions when chiral symmetry is restored .",
    "still , the argument is based on correlation functions and does not explicitly relate the @xmath2 mass to the other pseudo - scalar masses . to establish this relation ,",
    "we revisit the witten - veneziano ( wv ) formula @xcite for the @xmath2 mass in vacuum and generalize it to finite temperature .",
    "although the formula is obtained in the large @xmath8 limit , we will obtain an explicit relation that relates the @xmath2 mass to condensates and two - point correlation functions at finite temperature .",
    "therefore the symmetry restoration pattern observed in the two - point function will be reflected in the @xmath2 mass .",
    "for the physical case of @xmath7 with explicit quark masses , this result implies that the mass of @xmath2 will become degenerate with the other pseudo - scalar mesons up to the quark masses when chiral symmetry is restored .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : correlation ] , we will revisit the main results in ref .  .",
    "we will then review and generalize the wv formula in section [ sec : wv ] .",
    "we discuss the @xmath2 mass in sec.iv .",
    "the summary will be given in the last section .",
    "here , we start with a brief summary of the main result given in ref.@xcite . the starting point is the euclidean partition function of qcd : @xmath9 & = & \\int d[a ] e^{-s_{ym } } { \\rm det } [ d \\hspace*{-.2cm}\\slash + m_q ] \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\sum_{\\nu } z[j]_\\nu,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 .",
    "the second line writes the partition function in terms of topological configurations with the topological charge @xmath11 .",
    "the whole integral in the first line is a positive definite quantity @xcite , which we will denote as @xmath12 for later convenience .",
    "the topological configurations are always accompanied by @xmath13 number of right - handed ( left - handed ) fermion zero modes such that @xmath14 . in",
    "such topologically non - trivial configurations , the fermion determinant comes with special chirality such that partition function with @xmath15 can be written more explicitly as follows : @xmath9_{\\nu=1 }   & = & \\int d[a]_{\\nu=1 } e^{-s_{ym } } { \\rm det ' } [ d \\hspace*{-.2cm}\\slash + m_q ] \\nonumber \\\\ &   & \\times { \\rm det } \\bigg ( \\int d^4x \\bar{\\psi_0}(x ) m_q \\psi_0(x ) \\bigg ) , \\label{part - top}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the prime in the fermion determinant means that the chiral zero modes @xmath16 have been explicitly taken out into the second determinant .",
    "therefore , in the chiral limit @xmath17 , the topological configuration does not contribute to the partition function as the fermion determinant gives zero .",
    "however , these terms do contribute in the correlations functions and select out the @xmath2 from the other pseudo - scalars .",
    "higher topological configurations will contribute at higher point functions when there are sufficiently many external legs to saturate the zero modes .    to see this ,",
    "consider a two point function of a generic quark bilinear : @xmath18 \\nonumber \\\\ & + { \\rm tr } [ s_a(x , x ) \\gamma ]   { \\rm tr } [ s_a(0,0 ) \\gamma ] + ( zero~mode ) \\bigg],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first , second and third term being the connected , disconnected terms and possible zero mode contribution respectively .",
    "@xmath19 is the quark propagator in the presence of the gauge field .",
    "when @xmath20 contains a flavor matrix , the contributions from the disconnected diagrams are identically zero .",
    "the results in refs.@xcite and @xcite can be summarized as follows . when one takes the difference between the two - point functions of chiral partners , the difference vanishes when chiral symmetry is restored . when the difference is taken between those composed of currents that are related by a chiral transformation and an extra @xmath0 transformation",
    ", there will be an extra contribution from the zero modes .",
    "as an example , the difference between a pseudo - scalar and @xmath2 is given as follows in su(2 ) : @xmath21   { \\rm tr } [ s_a(0,0 ) \\gamma_5 ] \\bigg ] \\nonumber \\\\   & + \\frac{1}{z } \\int d \\mu_{\\nu=\\pm 1 } \\bigg[4 \\bar{\\psi_0}(x ) \\psi_0(x ) \\bar{\\psi_0}(0 ) \\psi_0(0 ) \\bigg ] .",
    "\\label{pi - eta - diff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in ref.@xcite , it was shown that the first term goes to zero in the chiral limit when chiral symmetry is restored .",
    "this result is in fact independent of the number of flavors and also valid when the @xmath22 inside the trace is replaced by other gamma matrices such as @xmath23 or @xmath24 .",
    "the zero - mode contributions appearing in the second term of eq.([pi - eta - diff ] ) come from the topological configuration in eq.([part - top ] ) and are responsible for the appearance of the @xmath0 effect .",
    "however , when @xmath25 , the second determinant in eq.([part - top ] ) will have 2@xmath5 zero mode lines and hence the zero - mode contributions in eq.([pi - eta - diff ] ) will be proportional to @xmath26 and vanish in the chiral limit .",
    "therefore , when chiral symmetry is restored , the @xmath0 breaking effect will not appear in the two - point functions .",
    "however , this does not necessarily mean that the @xmath2 mass will become degenerate with the other pseudo scalar mesons because the coupling of the currents to the @xmath2 might just go to zero .",
    "therefore , let us look at a relation that directly relates the mass of @xmath2 to the chiral order parameters .",
    "as a first step of this study , we review the derivation of the wv mass formula  @xcite .",
    "we start with the gluonic correlation function defined in a pure glue theory : @xmath27 one should note that , in the large @xmath8 limit@xcite , eq.([eq1 ] ) scales as order @xmath28 .",
    "there is also a well known low energy theorem for the correlation function at zero external momentum @xmath29 , whose value we will come back in the next section .",
    "however , when massless quarks are added to the theory , the low energy theorem leads to the vanishing correlation function @xmath30 , where the subscript @xmath31 means the presence of light quarks , through the anomaly relation that relates the pseudo - scalar gluon current to axial current @xmath32 , where @xmath33 .",
    "this seems a little odd , because quark effects are suppressed in large @xmath8 , but for the low energy theorem , the leading @xmath8 effect seems to be canceled by a subleading @xmath8 effect .",
    "the answer to this question led to the wv formula .    in terms of the physical states ,",
    "the correlation functions looks as follows when light quarks are added .",
    "@xmath34 in the spectral form , eq.([eq2 ] ) , the first term in the right hand side indicates contributions from glueballs , while the second term shows those from the meson composed of light quarks . one can show that the residue of the first term is of order @xmath28 whereas the quark effects are of order @xmath8@xcite : @xmath35 since all the meson masses should have a smooth large @xmath8 limit @xmath36 , the terms of quark effects , @xmath37 , are suppressed in @xmath38 as expected . the resolution to the seemingly inconsistent result is by noting the existence of @xmath1-meson whose mass scales as order @xmath38 .",
    "one then recovers the consistent low energy theorem @xmath39 , if the second term is saturated by the @xmath2-meson and scales as @xmath28 . from this condition",
    ", one finds , @xmath40 by using the u@xmath41 anomaly , @xmath42 eq.([eq4 ] ) becomes as follows : @xmath43 where @xmath5 is the number of light flavors . in eq.([eq5 ] ) , we made use of @xmath44 to lowest order in @xmath8 .",
    "eq.([eq6 ] ) is the celebrated wv formula .",
    "consider the correction to eq.([eq6 ] ) at finite temperature . as mentioned before , the correlation function in eq.([eq1 ] ) is order @xmath28 , as can be seen by the two loops representing two gluon lines in fig.[fig1]-(a ) .        at finite temperature , the thermal correction could come from the thermal gluon or quark interactions .",
    "fig.[fig1]-(b , c ) show the thermal corrections to @xmath45 while fig.[fig1]-(d , e ) show those to @xmath46 .    the dominant thermal gluonic contribution to @xmath45 comes from fig.[fig1]-(b ) and scales as @xmath28 as in the vacuum scaling .",
    "the scaling comes as follows , @xmath47 which comes from the internal loop , two coupling and the number of external thermal gluons respectively .",
    "the contributions where the gluons couple directly to the currents scale the same as in fig.[fig1]-(b ) . on the other hand , the contributions from thermal quarks to @xmath45 scales as follows , @xmath48 where the factors are the same as before except for the last factor , which comes from the number of external quark lines , as can be seen from fig.[fig1]-(c ) .",
    "therefore , in the large @xmath8 limit , the thermal gluonic effect scales the same as in the leading vacuum scaling and will contribute to modifying @xmath45 .",
    "as for the modification in the quark loops @xmath46 , the thermal gluonic effects are shown in fig.[fig1]-(d ) , and the thermal quark effects in fig.[fig1]-(e ) . both scale as @xmath49 , and",
    "can thus be neglected in the leading order correction .",
    "if the system is in the confined state , the hadronic side will be saturated by color singlet glueball , meson and nucleons .",
    "here , the dominant contribution comes from the nucleons .",
    "one can show that the contribution from the nucleon to all figures in fig.[fig1 ] scale as @xmath49 because the nucleon contains @xmath8 quarks . on the other hand ,",
    "the contributions from meson or glueballs are suppressed in @xmath50 as the number of constituents are finite .",
    "hence , hadron effects can be neglected until near the phase transition point where the density of states increases , after which one can use the quark and gluon degrees of freedom .",
    "therefore , same arguments hold as in the vacuum .",
    "namely , the addition of quarks somehow has to cancel the leading @xmath8 behavior at @xmath51 .",
    "this cancelation can not be done by collective states , as quark collective states are also suppressed in large @xmath8 limit , and hence has to come from a modified @xmath1 contribution .",
    "all in all , a similar equation to eq.([eq4 ] ) will hold at finite temperature , with @xmath52 now defined at finite temperature at @xmath1 momentum zero .",
    "moreover , it should be noted that the @xmath1 mass we are discussing now could be different from that of the pole mass as we are discussing the scalar part of the mass , which survives at @xmath53 .",
    "a simplified example would be to assume that the small energy and momentum self energy has the following form , with @xmath54 and @xmath55 being the small corrections , @xmath56 the pole mass at @xmath57 would be @xmath58 .",
    "but the mass we are talking about is @xmath59 .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath60 has a nontrivial correction at finite temperature as we will see in the following sections .",
    "now , @xmath61 can be obtained from the low energy theorem . here",
    "we use the derivation using the heavy quark expansion  @xcite . for technical reasons ,",
    "we start from a slightly different definition of the correlation function .",
    "@xmath62 \\right{\\rangle}\\label{eq10}\\ ] ] it can be shown  @xcite that @xmath63 now , any matrix element with canonical dimension @xmath64 should be proportional to the @xmath65 power of the scale @xmath66 with @xmath67 . hence , the gluon condensate at finite temperature and density should be of the following form .",
    "@xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 is a generic function specifying the temperature and density dependence of the gluon condensate .",
    "then eq.([eq11 ] ) becomes , @xmath71 now , combining eq.([eq4 ] ) and eq.([eq14 ] ) , one finds , @xmath72 but now since we can make the identification of the left and right hand side only in the large @xmath8 limit , the right hand side should be calculated in the quenched approximation .",
    "this means that one should just read off the temperature dependence of the gluon condensate from the lattice calculation for pure gauge theory , and also take @xmath73 .",
    "thus , the @xmath2 mass is given by @xmath74      in order to evaluate the in - medium @xmath1 mass from eq.([eq16 ] ) , all we need are the temperature - dependence of the gluon condensate and the coupling of @xmath75 to @xmath2 .",
    "first let us consider the denominator of eq.([eq16 ] ) .",
    "it has been known for a long time , that the gluon condensate has contribution from the perturbative and non - perturbative contribution .",
    "moreover , it was also known that at the critical temperature , the non - perturbative contribution changes abruptly , but does not vanish completely , and retains more than half of its non - perturbative value  @xcite .",
    "the effect of subtracting out the second term in the denominator of eq.([eq16 ] ) is to get rid of the perturbative correction , or the seemingly scale breaking effect that is not related to scale breaking but due to the introduction of an external scale parameter @xmath76 .",
    "the leading perturbative correction to the gluon condensate is proportional to @xmath77  @xcite .",
    "therefore , assuming that the temperature dependence is of the following form , @xmath78 we find , @xmath79 if the temperature dependence of g is neglected , the conclusion will not change if we consider this seriously . ] .",
    "the only temperature dependence that survives is @xmath80 , whose scale dependence is coming from dimensional transmutation and not from the external temperature only .",
    "it is the non - perturbative part that dominates the behavior of the right hand side of eq.([eq16 ] ) .",
    "-dependence of gluon condensate and its derivative fitted to wuppertal - budapest lattice data in full qcd.,width=264,height=170 ]    in fig.[fig2 ] , we show the model fit  @xcite to the wuppertal - budapest s full qcd data  @xcite together with the modified @xmath76-dependent gluon operator as it appears in eq.([eq16 ] ) . in the quenched calculation ,",
    "the only difference is that the change is taking place more abruptly near the new critical temperature@xcite .",
    "one can see that the change in the denominator of eq.([eq16 ] ) will tend to reduce the @xmath2 mass near the critical temperature .",
    "the final step in obtaining the mass of @xmath1 using eq.([eq16 ] ) , when chiral symmetry is restored , is estimating the change of the coupling @xmath81 .",
    "for that purpose , let us consider @xmath82 in eq.([eq1 ] ) in the full theory , but rewrite it in terms of the quark axial current using the anomaly relation .",
    "@xmath83 , \\label{coupling}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have subtracted out the contribution from the conserved vector current . using the previous terminology , when chiral symmetry is restored",
    ", the connected piece will cancel , as they are the same as the difference between flavored chiral partners , and only the disconnected pieces will remain .",
    "assuming that the spectral sum starts from the @xmath1 , we find eq.([coupling ] ) can then be written as follows ,    @xmath84   { \\rm tr } [ s_a(0,0)i \\gamma_\\nu \\gamma_5 ] -   { \\rm tr } [ s_a(x , x )   \\gamma_\\mu ]   { \\rm tr } [ s_a(0,0 ) \\gamma_\\nu   ]   \\bigg ] .",
    "\\label{sumrule}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    however , the disconnected pieces are all of the same order in @xmath85 when chiral symmetry is restored . @xmath86 \\sim { \\rm tr } [ s_a(x , x ) \\gamma ] \\sim o(m_q),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is a hermitian gamma matrix@xcite . since eq.([sumrule ] ) is valid for any @xmath87 , we find that @xmath88 when chiral symmetry is restored . therefore ,",
    "going back to eq.([eq16 ] ) and making use of the previous discussions , we find that when chiral symmetry is restored , @xmath89 in the chiral limit .",
    "one concludes that in the large @xmath8 limit of qcd , @xmath1 mass will become degenerate with the other goldstone bosons .",
    "it should be noted that the @xmath1 mass that is being quenched is the part of the mass that comes from the breaking of the @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "going back to eq.([eq6 ] ) and substituting the vacuum value of eq.([eq14 ] ) one finds , @xmath90 where we have used @xmath91 and @xmath92 . this is smaller than the vacuum value of the @xmath1 mass as expected . assuming that the pseudo scalar mesons do not change their mass towards the phase transition point , it is this extra @xmath0 mass of @xmath1 that is going to be quenched in the chiral symmetry restored phase .",
    "few remarks are in order .",
    "first , in the quenched approximation , the changes of order parameters take place only near the phase transition point .",
    "this suggests that the effect of quenching might only be visible when the hadronization temperature is close to the phase transition point as in the case of rhic or lhc energies for example .",
    "second , it is hard to make a quantitative estimate on how much of this mass is quenched in the nuclear medium , as the effects of density are subleading in the large @xmath8 limit .",
    "however , assuming eq.([eq16 ] ) is an exact relation , we can use eq.([sumrule ] ) to approximate @xmath93\\propto",
    "\\langle \\bar{q}q \\rangle $ ] and then use it in eq.([eq16 ] ) to deduce @xmath94 , assuming that the change in the gluon condensate is small in nuclear medium . therefore ,",
    "if the chiral order parameter reduces by 20% in nuclear medium the @xmath0 breaking part of the @xmath1 mass will also reduce by the same fraction .",
