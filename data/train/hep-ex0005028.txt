    "the study of fermion  pair production , @xmath0 , at centre  of  mass energies well above the z resonance allows to look for physics beyond the standard model .",
    "the successful running of lep in 1997 and 1998 at energies of 182.7   and 188.7  , and the tenfold increase of luminosity compared to our previous searches  @xcite , improves substantially the sensitivity to new physics phenomena .",
    "the results presented in this paper are based on analyses of our measurements of hadronic and leptonic cross sections and leptonic forward  backward asymmetries  @xcite .",
    "the measurements in all channels are used to search for four - fermion contact interactions .",
    "the virtual exchange of leptoquarks and scalar quarks is investigated using our hadron cross section measurements .",
    "the effects of scalar neutrino exchange are looked for in all leptonic channels .",
    "limits on contact interactions , and on leptoquark , scalar quark and scalar neutrino couplings have been presented also by other lep collaborations  @xcite .",
    "the effects of strings , predicted recently  @xcite in theories of quantum gravity with extra dimensions  @xcite , are searched for in bhabha scattering .",
    "this is an extension of the searches for low scale gravity in fermion ",
    "pair production at lep  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a form factor ansatz is used to estimate the size of leptons and quarks .",
    "measurements of cross sections and forward  backward asymmetries for the reactions @xmath0 have been performed with the l3 detector  @xcite at centre  of  mass energies , @xmath1 , of 130.0  , 136.1  , 161.3  , 172.3  , 182.7   and 188.7  @xcite .",
    "they correspond to an integrated luminosity of 265.4  pb@xmath2 .    for the @xmath3 final state",
    "both leptons have to be in the polar angular range @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the angle between the incoming electron and the outgoing lepton .",
    "muon and tau  pair candidates are selected with both leptons in the fiducial volume given by @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "hadron events are selected in the full solid angle .    in total 28470 hadron events and 9417 lepton ",
    "pair events are selected . a minimum effective centre  of  mass energy , @xmath8 , or a maximum acollinearity angle in the bhabha channel ,",
    "are required to select events without substantial energy loss due to initial state radiation .",
    "the remaining samples , which are studied in this paper , contain in total 7785 hadron and 7704 lepton  pair events .",
    "the measurements of total cross sections and leptonic forward  backward asymmetries are analysed in terms of new physics , which will manifest itself as deviations from the standard model predictions .",
    "the contributions of contact interactions , leptoquarks and scalar quarks are included directly into the improved born cross section calculated with the program zfitter  @xcite and are convoluted to account for qed radiative corrections .",
    "for the analyses including the @xmath3 final state , i.e. contact interactions , scalar neutrinos , strings and form factors , the effects of new phenomena are computed with dedicated programs in the improved born approximation , taking into account qed radiative corrections . for contact interactions where both approaches are used ,",
    "the results agree well with each other .",
    "the measurements are compared to the predictions of the standard model  @xcite as calculated using the zfitter and topaz0  @xcite programs with the following parameters  @xcite : @xmath9  , @xmath10 , @xmath11  , @xmath12 , and @xmath13  .",
    "the results of our analyses are not sensitive to small variations of these parameters .",
    "the theoretical uncertainties on the standard model predictions are estimated to be below 1% except for large angle bhabha scattering where the uncertainty is 2%  @xcite .",
    "the measurements show no statistically significant deviations from the standard model expectations . in their absence , limits at 95% confidence level on the contributions of new physics are determined by integrating the log - likelihood functions in the physically allowed range of the parameters describing new physics phenomena , assuming a uniform prior distribution .",
    "the statistical errors and systematic uncertainties of the measurements  @xcite , as well as the theory uncertainties given above , are combined in quadrature for all analyses .",
    "four - fermion contact interactions offer a general framework for describing interactions beyond the standard model .",
    "they are characterised by a coupling strength , @xmath14 , and by an energy scale , @xmath15 , which can be viewed as the typical mass of new heavy particles being exchanged . at energies much lower than @xmath15 , the exchange of virtual new particles is described by an effective lagrangian  @xcite :    @xmath16    where e@xmath17 and @xmath18 denote the left and right  handed initial  state electron and final  state fermion fields .",

    "is chosen to be 1 and @xmath23 or @xmath24 , leaving the energy scale @xmath15 as a free parameter .",
    "the helicity combinations of the specific models considered are defined in table  [ tab : ci - models ] .",
    "atomic physics parity violation experiments probe with high precision the couplings of electrons to quarks of the first family , and place severe constraints on the scale @xmath15 of the order of 15  @xcite .",
    "the vv , aa , v0 and a0 models are parity conserving and hence are not constrained by such measurements .",
    "the four  fermion contact interactions for the different types of final  state fermions are tested separately as well as for all flavours combined and lower limits on the scale @xmath15 are derived .",
    "the lower limits on @xmath15 obtained from lepton  pair final states are summarised in table  [ tab : ci - leptons ] and figure  [ fig : ci - leptons ] .",
    "it is important to note that the pure leptonic case is only accessible at lep .    for hadronic final states",
    "the cases where the contact interactions affect either all flavours at the same time , or only one flavour of up  type or down  type quarks , are analyzed .",
    "the results are given in table  [ tab : ci - hadrons ] and depicted in figure  [ fig : ci - hadrons ] , together with the combined results for all charged fermions .",
    "similar limits are obtained from studies of deep inelastic scattering at hera  @xcite and proton  antiproton collisions at the tevatron  @xcite .",

    "constant , mass limits can be derived .",
    "the results for these lower bounds on leptoquark masses are given in table  [ tab : lqmass ] . in case of @xmath50 exchange , i.e. coupling to left - handed fermions , the assumption @xmath51 yields a very small contribution to the hadron cross section that is not observable with the precision of our measurements .",
    "the results at lep complement the leptoquark searches at hera . in most cases the indirect limits on leptoquark masses and couplings obtained in our analysis are more stringent than the corresponding limits presented by the h1 collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the indirect search covers regions at high leptoquark masses above the reach of direct leptoquark searches  @xcite .",
    "even in a minimal supersymmetric model  @xcite the most general superpotential contains interactions violating r  parity in the trilinear couplings of superfields .",
    "the only renormalisable gauge invariant operator that couples fermions and their scalar partners is given by  @xcite : @xmath52 where @xmath26 and @xmath53 are the leptonic , and @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the quark superfields .",

    "planes are excluded .    from the analysis of the hadronic cross section measurements , upper limits on the yukawa couplings",
    "@xmath68 @xmath69 are derived depending on the mass of exchanged scalar quarks .",
    "one single yukawa coupling at a time is assumed to be much larger than the others which are neglected .",
    "two cases are analysed : @xmath70 only the exchange of the much lighter scalar quark type is important . due to quark universality the limits on @xmath68 coincide for each of the two cases of mass relation .",
    "parity breaking yukawa couplings are mainly restricted by virtual exchange of right  handed scalar down  type quarks in the @xmath34channel which couple in the same way as @xmath71 leptoquarks with @xmath72 .",
    "their amplitudes interfere with the equal  helicity amplitude ( ll ) of the standard model .",
    "the amplitudes for left  handed scalar up  type quark exchange in the @xmath32channel are the same as for @xmath73 leptoquark exchange and interfere with the opposite  helicity amplitude ( lr ) .",
    "the latter is suppressed in comparison to ( ll ) .",
    "the results on @xmath68 can be taken from figure  [ fig : sca ] considering @xmath71(l ) and @xmath73 .",
    "assuming scalar up  type and down  type quark masses to be equal and both contributing to the hadronic cross section yields similar limits as for the case @xmath74 .",
    "recently , it has been realized that in a string theory of quantum gravity  @xcite there are new phenomenological consequences .",
    "for instance , massive string mode oscillations can lead to contact interactions , which may have stronger effects than those caused by the virtual exchange of gravitons .",
    "the effects of scale strings on bhabha scattering are computed  @xcite by multiplying the leading - order scattering amplitudes by a common form factor , which depends on the string scale @xmath75 and the mandelstam variables @xmath76 and @xmath32 . the standard model cross section for bhabha scattering",
    "is modified as follows : @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the gamma function .",
    "the differential cross sections measured at 183 and 189 are used to derive a lower limit on the string scale @xmath79 of 0.49  .",
    "the result of the analysis at 189 is depicted in figure  [ fig : string ] .",
    "in the standard model the fermions and the gauge bosons are considered to be pointlike .",
    "if this is not the case , form factors or anomalous magnetic dipole moments of the fermions could be observed  @xcite .",
    "the fermion - pair measurements above the z pole are analysed for such effects .",
    "the standard model cross sections for the reactions @xmath0 are modified as follows : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the mandelstam variable @xmath76 or @xmath32 for @xmath76 or @xmath32channel exchange , and the form factors of the initial and final state fermions are denoted as @xmath82 and @xmath83 , respectively .",
    "they are parametrized by a dirac form factor : @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the radius of the fermion .",
    "the upper limits on the fermion radii obtained from our data are shown in table  [ tab : fradii ] .",
    "they are derived with the assumption @xmath86 . for the , and @xmath39 final states the limits given in table  [ tab : fradii ] will increase by a factor of @xmath87 under the most conservative assumption that the electron is pointlike ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "the expected effects on the differential cross section for the @xmath3 final state are shown in figure  [ fig : string ] .",
    "the limits for quarks derived in this paper are more stringent than similar limits from high energy analyses of interactions involving quarks and electrons by the h1 collaboration  @xcite in deep inelastic scattering , and by the cdf collaboration  @xcite from study of the drell - yan process .",
    "limits on lepton radii have been extracted from the high precision low energy measurements of the magnetic dipole moment @xmath89 of the electron and the muon  @xcite . in the case where the deviations from the standard model of the magnetic dipole moments of the leptons depend linearly on their mass , the measurements of dipole moments can be interpreted as giving much more stringent limits . by contrast , in the case where the deviations depend quadratically on the masses , our limit on the electron size is one order of magnitude lower , and our limit on the muon size is similar to the limits derived from @xmath90 measurements .",
    "the measurements of fermion  pair cross sections and forward  backward asymmetries , performed with the l3 detector at centre  of  mass energies between 130   and 189  , are used to search for effects of new physics phenomena .",
    "no hint of manifestations of physics beyond the standard model is found .",
    "the sensitivity of the searches , performed at energies above the z pole , has improved substantially compared to our previous publications .",
    "limits on the energy scale @xmath15 of four  fermion contact interactions in the range 3.8  14.4   for leptons , and in the range 2.8  6.1   for quarks are obtained .",
    "the effects of the exchange of leptoquarks or r  parity violating scalar quarks and scalar neutrinos are studied . in both cases , upper limits on the coupling constants , @xmath72 and @xmath91 , or @xmath92 and @xmath93 are determined as a function of the particle masses .",
    "lower limits on the mass of leptoquarks between 55  and 560 , depending on the leptoquark type , are derived assuming @xmath94 .",
    "in addition , new searches are performed for the effects of strings , predicted in quantum gravity models , and a lower limit on the string scale @xmath75 of 0.49   is set .",
    "from an analysis of form factors , upper limits on the size of the different leptons and quarks in the range are derived .",
