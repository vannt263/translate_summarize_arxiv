    "the family of quasi one - dimensional organic superconductors ( the bechgard - fabre salts @xmath5 ) demonstrates , at low temperatures @xmath6 , transitions to almost all known electronic phases , see @xcite . at higher @xmath7 , usually there is also a set of weak structural transitions of the ( aos ) which are slight arrangements of chains of counterions @xmath8 @xcite . at even higher @xmath9 , also other transitions @xcite were observed sometimes in the @xmath10 subfamily but they were not explained and left unattended .",
    "recently their mysterious nature has been elucidated by discoveries of the huge anomaly in the dielectric susceptibility @xmath1 @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ epsilon ] ) and of the charge disproportionation ( cd ) seen by the nmr @xcite .",
    "the new displacive instability and the usual aos seem to be independent , as proved by finding their sequence in @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the phase transition was interpreted @xcite as the least expected one : to the ferroelectric ( fe ) state , which was proved by the clear - cut fitting of the anomaly in @xmath12 to the curie law ( see the figure in @xcite ) .",
    "the fe transition is followed by a fast formation , or the steep increase , of the conductivity gap @xmath13 ( see the fig.[cond ] ) with no signs of a spin gap formation",
    ". hence we deal with a surprising fe version of the mott - hubbard state which usually was associated rather with magnetic orderings .",
    "the fe transition in @xmath0 is a very particular , bright manifestation of a more general phenomenon of the cd , which already has been predicted in @xcite and now becomes recognized as a common feature of organic and some other conductors @xcite .",
    "the anomalous diverging polarizability is coming from the electronic system , even if ions are very important to choose and stabilize the long range @xmath14 order .",
    "thus the theory @xcite suggests that the collective singular contribution @xmath15 ( @xmath16 is the metallic plasma frequency ) develops upon the already big intergap contribution @xmath17 which is also seen as the background at the fig.[epsilon ] . typical plots at the fig.[epsilon ] demonstrate very sharp ( even in the @xmath18 scale ! ) fe peaks , while the anti - fe case of @xmath19 shows a smoother maximum . at the subsequent ist order ao transition in the case of @xmath20 , @xmath1 drops down which might be caused by the increase of @xmath13 seen at the conductivity plot at the fig.[cond ] .",
    "finally the iind order spin- peierls transition in the case of @xmath21 shows up only as a shoulder .",
    "all that seems to collaborate towards a consistent picture .    already within the nonperturbed crystal structure at @xmath22 ,",
    "the tiny dimerization of bonds by anions @xmath8 provokes the dielectrization @xcite , see more references in @xcite .",
    "the counting of the mean electronic occupation changes from @xmath23 per molecule to @xmath24 per their dimer which opens ( according to dzyaloshinskii & larkin , luther & emery ) the route to the mott - hubbard insulator . at @xmath25 the cd adds more to the charge gap @xmath13 which is formed now by _",
    "joint effects of alternations of bonds and sites_. the conductivity @xmath26 plots at the fig.[cond ] show this change by kinks at @xmath27 turning down to much higher activation energies at low @xmath6 .",
    "the steepness of @xmath26 just below @xmath28 reflects the growth of the cd contribution to the gap @xmath29 , see below .",
    "vs @xmath6 for fe cases @xmath21 ( @xmath30 ) , @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) , @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) , @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) and for the anti - fe @xmath19 ( @xmath37).,width=283 ]    none of these two perturbations changes the unit cell of the zigzag stack which basically contains two molecules , hence @xmath38 ( @xmath39 is the cd wave vector ) .",
    "their sequence lifts the mirror and then the inversion symmetries which must lead to the on - stack electric polarization . by a good fortune",
    ", the 3d pattern of the cd appears in two , anti - fe and fe , forms : i ) antiphase between stacks , @xmath40 which allows for its structural identification @xcite ( found only for @xmath19 ) ; and ii ) inphase ( @xmath41 hence the character ) which is the macroscopic fe state typically observed today @xcite .",
    "both types are the same paramagnetic insulators ( the mi phase of @xcite ) as we can see in fig.[cond ] and in other examples @xcite ; also their cd shows up similarly in the nmr splitting @xcite .",
    "( at @xmath42 ) for @xmath20 ( @xmath43 ) and @xmath19 ( @xmath30).,width=283 ]",
    "the microscopic theory for the `` combined mott - hubbard state '' @xcite accounts for two contributions , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , to the umklapp scattering of electrons which come from two symmetry breaking effects : the built - in nonequivalence of bonds and the spontaneous one of sites @xcite .",
    "the appearance of @xmath45 is regulated by a single parameter @xmath46 ( @xmath47 of @xcite , @xmath48 of today s convention ) which collects all information about electronic interactions .",
    "the spontaneous cd @xmath49 requires that @xmath50 , far enough from @xmath51 for noninteracting electrons . the magnitude @xmath52 is determined by a competition between the electronic gain of energy and its loss @xmath53 from the lattice deformation and charge redistribution .",
    "the @xmath14 ordering of signs @xmath54 discriminates between the fe and anti - fe states .",
    "while the earliest theoretical approach @xcite applies well to a generic cd , here the pronouncedly @xmath55 electronic regime calls for a special treatment @xcite which also needs to be well suited for the fe transition .",
    "it is done in terms of electronic phases @xmath56 and @xmath57 defined as for the cdw order parameters @xmath58 ) such that @xmath59 and @xmath60 count local concentrations of the charge and the spin . beyond the energies of charge and spin polarizations @xmath61 and @xmath62 , there is the commensurability energy @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "the gap @xmath13 is related to the total umklapp amplitude @xmath66 via its renormalized value @xmath67 .    for a given @xmath45",
    ", the ground state is doubly degenerate between @xmath68 and @xmath69 which allows for phase @xmath70 solitons with the energy @xmath13 which are the charge @xmath71 spinless particles , the ( anti)holons observed in conductivity at both @xmath72 . also @xmath45 itself can change the sign between different domains of ionic displacements .",
    "then the electronic system must also adjust its ground state from @xmath73 to @xmath74 or to @xmath75 .",
    "hence the fe domain boundary @xmath76 requires for the phase @xmath73-solitons of the increment @xmath77 or @xmath78 which will concentrate the non integer charge @xmath79 or @xmath80 per chain .",
    "below @xmath28 , the @xmath81 solitons must be aggregated into domain walls @xcite which motion might be responsible for the observed frequency dispersion of @xmath1 , and indeed it is more pronounced bellow @xmath82 , see @xcite .",
    "but well above @xmath28 they can be seen as individual particles , charge carriers .",
    "such a possibility requires for the fluctuational @xmath55 regime of growing cd .",
    "it seems to be possible sometimes in view of a strong increase of @xmath1 at @xmath83 even for the anti - fe case of the @xmath19 which signifies the growing single chain polarizability before the 3d interactions come to the game .",
    "the subsequent ao of the tetramerization in @xmath11 exhorts upon electrons a cdw type effect thus adding the energy @xmath84 ( the shift @xmath85 , the mixture of bond- and site cdws , reflects the lack of the inversion symmetry below @xmath82 ) .",
    "it lifts the continuous @xmath57 invariance thus opening the spin gap @xmath86 growing below @xmath87 .",
    "moreover it lifts even the discrete @xmath88 invariance of @xmath89 thus prohibiting the @xmath90 solitons .",
    "but the joint invariance ( @xmath91 ) is still present giving rise to _ combined topological solitons_. they are composed by the charge @xmath92 core ( with @xmath93 within the length @xmath94 ) which is supplemented by longer spin @xmath23 tails of the @xmath95 soliton ( @xmath96 within the length @xmath97 ) .",
    "these are the particles seen at the conductivity plot of the fig.[cond ] below @xmath87 .",
    "by now the revaluation concerns definitely only the @xmath10 subfamily .",
    "the @xmath98 compounds are highly conductive which today does not allow for difficult experiments either with the low frequency @xmath1 or with the small nmr splitting .",
    "nevertheless the transition may be their , just being hidden or existing in a fluctuational regime like for stripes in high-@xmath99 cuprates .",
    "when it is confirmed , then the whole picture of intriguing abnormal metallic state @xcite will be revised .",
    "the signature of the fe cd state may have been already seen in optical experiments @xcite . indeed the drude like peak appearing within the pseudogap can be interpreted now as the optically active mode of the fe polarization ; the joint lattice mass will naturally explain its surprisingly low weight .",
    "vice versa , the fe mode must exist in @xmath10 compounds , which identification is the ultimate goal .",
    "( being overdamped near @xmath82 , this mode must grow in frequency following the order parameter as @xmath100 which can yield about two orders of magnitude at low @xmath6 . )",
    "even the optical pseudogap itself @xcite , being unexpectedly big for @xmath98 compounds with their less pronounced dimerization of bonds , can be largely due to the hidden spontaneous dimerization of sites .",
    "a popular interpretation @xcite for optics of @xmath98 compounds neglects the dimerization and relies upon the more generic 4- fold commensurability effects originating higher order ( 8 particles ) umklapp processes .",
    "they give rise to the energy @xmath101 which stabilization would require for ultra strong @xmath102 repulsion corresponding to @xmath103 in compare to our moderate constraint @xmath50 .",
    "while not excluded in principle , this mechanism does not work in @xmath10 .",
    "we saw that even small increments of the dimerization just below @xmath28 immediately transfer to the activation energy .",
    "finally recall also numerical studies which have been performed in response to new discoveries .",
    "usually they pass the test for the cd but they may fail in finding the fe ; e.g. the nonpolar(1100 type ordering has been claimed @xcite , rather than the necessary 1010 one .",
