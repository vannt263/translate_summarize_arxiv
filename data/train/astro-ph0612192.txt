    "beyond the galactic and local - group ( in particular , magellanic clouds and m31 ) microlensing experiments @xcite , the main interest on the point - mass lenses lies in the effect of the individual stars in a lensing galaxy @xcite . for these cases , each point - mass lens can not be treated individually and their collective effects usually differ drastically from that of the simple linear superposition of them .",
    "the usual approach to this `` high - optical - depth microlensing '' problem is `` inverse ray tracing '' @xcite , that is , examining statistical properties of lensing observables using monte - carlo realizations of the lensing system .",
    "however , as the number of the individual point - mass lenses to reproduce the realistic scenario well approaches the number of stars in the galaxy , this becomes very expensive rather quickly in terms of the required resources .",
    "another complementary approach to the problem is from the random walk and the probability theory together with the thermodynamic approximation ( that is , effectively considering the limit at the infinite number of the stars ) , which has been quite successful in certain well - defined problems @xcite .    in the following ,",
    "we consider a different approach to the problem : seeking complete analytic solutions . in many complex systems , imposing high level of symmetry can reduce the problem to a simpler one , which may be otherwise too complicated to analyze . in a similar spirit ,",
    "in this paper we consider gravitational lensing by equal point masses that are arranged in an infinitely extended regular lattice .",
    "after we derive the appropriate lens equation in sect .",
    "[ sec : le ] , they are examined in sect .  [",
    "sec : cc ] to find the corresponding critical curves and the caustic networks . in sect .",
    "[ sec : mn ] , we study the mean number of positive parity images , which is compared to the case of lensing by an infinite random star field . in sect .  [",
    "sec : sh ] , we consider the effect of the external potential by mean of adding external shear ( and convergence ) , and discuss some possible connections to more realistic lensing scenarios .",
    "we argue that , while the system considered here may be somewhat artificial in its construct and rather abstract in its nature , the study presented in this paper can lead us to some insight on microlensing at high optical depth .",
    "in most astronomical situations , gravitational lensing is described by the lens equation @xmath0 , which is derived from the lowest - order nontrivial approximation to the path of light propagation @xcite . here ,",
    "@xmath1 and @xmath2 are the ( 2-dimensional ) vectors representing the lines of sight toward , respectively , the angular positions of the source under the absence of lensing and the lensed image .",
    "the lensing potential @xmath3 is the gravitational potential ( equivalently , the gravitational ` shapiro ' time delay ) integrated along the line of sight up to a scale constant @xcite .    in particular , gravitational lensing by a point mass",
    "is described by the potential @xmath4 if the point - mass lens is located along the line of sight indicated by the vector @xmath5 @xcite . here",
    ", the scale constant @xmath6 is known as the ` einstein ( ring ) radius ' and determined by the mass of the lens ( @xmath7 ) and the distances among the source , the lens , and the observer . with this potential , we find the lens equation for point - mass lensing , @xmath8 where the unit of angular measurements has been chosen such that @xmath9 .",
    "the equation is generalized to the case of multiple point - mass lenses with a smoothly - varying ` large scale ' potential @xcite such that @xmath10 here , the unit of angular measurements is now given by @xmath6 corresponding to a fiducial mass scale @xmath11 and subsequently the ` external ' lensing potential @xmath12 should be rescaled appropriately .",
    "in addition , the masses of individual lenses @xmath13 enter into the equation as the ratio to the fiducial scale .",
    "next , let us think of the case that the equal point - mass lenses are located at the lattice points on an infinitely extended square grid .",
    "in addition , we ignore the effect of the external potential for the moment .",
    "utilizing the complex - number notation @xcite , the lens equation ( [ eq : leq ] ) then can be written as @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 are the complexified variables corresponding to @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath5 , respectively , and the over - bar notation is used to indicate complex conjugation .",
    "we further assume that the lens locations are given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are any pair of integers ( both running from the negative infinity to the positive infinity ) and @xmath21 is the half distance between adjacent grid points . without any loss of generality , @xmath21 can be restricted to be a positive real .",
    "strictly speaking , the ` deflection function ' @xmath22 given formally in terms of the infinite sum in equation ( [ eq : cdef ] ) is not well - defined as it is not convergent .",
    "this is in fact a natural consequence of having an infinite total lensing mass , which is unphysical .",
    "however , what is important in our understanding of the lensing is not the absolute amount of the deflection but the difference of the deflections between neighbouring lines of sights .",
    "that is to say , if we add any constant to the deflection function in the lens equation , the resulting lens equation is reduced to the equivalent one without the constant by introducing the `` offset '' to the source position to cancel the constant .",
    "two equations then are observationally equivalent because there is no a priori information regarding the source position in the absence of the lens . similarly , despite the seeming global failure of equation ( [ eq : cdef ] ) , we can still proceed by focusing on the local properties of the lensing described by equation ( [ eq : cdef ] ) .    for this , we first write down the ( formal ) second - order complex derivative of the deflection function ; @xmath23 ^ 3 } \\\\ \\equiv&-\\wp'(z\\vert\\omega,{\\mathrm i}\\omega)=-\\wp'\\left(z;g_2,0\\right ) \\end{split}\\\\ \\intertext{where } \\label{eq : g2 } g_2 = & \\left(\\frac{\\omega_0}\\omega\\right)^4 = \\frac{\\gamma^8_{1/4}}{16{\\upi}^4}\\kappa_\\star^2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we find that this is related to the definition of the special function known as the weierstrass elliptic function ",

    "* or see also appendix ) . here",
    ", @xmath24 is the gamma function , @xmath25 is the weierstrass elliptic function and @xmath26 is its complex derivative .",
    "we also use an abbreviated notation for ( the power to ) the gamma function such that @xmath27^n=\\gamma^n_x$ ] in order to avoid proliferation of parentheses and brackets .",
    "in addition , @xmath28 is the real half - period of the lemniscatic case of @xmath29-function ( see appendix ) and @xmath30 is the optical depth @xcite of the lenses .",
    "if we consider the square cell given by the centres of each lensing lattice , it is straightforward to see that there exists a lens corresponding to each cell with side length of @xmath31 .",
    "hence , the mean surface density of point masses is in fact given by @xmath32 , and therefore , the optical depth by @xmath33 .",
    "moreover , the 90-rotational symmetry of the system implies that the total shear due to all the other lenses on any given lens cancels out to be zero [ mathematically this indicates the constant term in the laurent - series expansion of @xmath34 is null ] .",
    "consequently , we find that @xmath35 and @xmath36 . here , @xmath37 is the weierstrass zeta function @xcite and @xmath38 is an arbitrary complex constant .",
    "if we choose the ` centre ' of the system to coincide with the lens at the coordinate origin , then we have @xmath39 .",
    "we note that , while the constant @xmath38 can not be independently determined , its choice is physically inconsequential .",
    "the situation is analogous to lensing by an infinitely extended mass screen .",
    "while a nave expectation from the symmetry appears to indicate null deflections along every line of sight , detailed physical consideration leads to the uniform focusing with respect to an arbitrary choice of the centre . in the current situation",
    ", the discrete translation symmetry implies the arbitrariness in the choice of the centre and consequently that of @xmath38 , which results in the infinite sum in equation ( [ eq : cdef ] ) not being well - determined .",
    "however , the constant - deflection term in the lens equation again only leads to a constant offset between the source and the image / lens plane , which has no observable consequence and therefore can be ignored .",
    "some results are immediate from the resulting lens equation @xmath40 for instance , the property of @xmath37 such that @xmath41= \\zeta(z;g_2,0)+\\frac{{\\upi}}{2\\omega}\\,(m - n{\\mathrm i})\\ ] ] for arbitrary integers @xmath19 and @xmath20 indicates that the vertices @xmath16 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 of a square in the lens plane map to the points on the source plane : @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 where @xmath49 , and therefore the mean inverse magnification is given by @xmath50 ^ 2=[1-{\\upi}/(2\\omega)^2]^2 $ ] .",
    "the result confirms the expectation that the sufficiently large beam of light would see the system as if it were a uniform screen of mass with a convergence ( or the optical depth ) @xmath51 . along the real line ,",
    "equation ( [ eq : le ] ) maps each segment between two adjacent lenses onto the whole real line , and thus it is easily argued that there are infinite number of images . however , unless @xmath52 , all but a finite number of images have negative parity .",
    "f1.cap      analogous to the preceding case , we can also set up the lens equation for the equal point - mass lenses located at the lattice points on an infinitely extended equilateral - triangular grid .",
    "the 60-rotational symmetry of the system again implies that the total shear on any given lens caused by the remaining set of lenses also cancels out .",
    "this fact , combined with the general definition of @xmath29-function indicates that the lens equation can again be written down using the weierstrass functions .",
    "if the lenses are placed over the grid given by @xmath53 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are integers , the corresponding lens equation is given by @xmath54 and @xmath55 is the real half - periods of the equiharmonic case of @xmath29-function ( see appendix ) whereas @xmath56 is the corresponding optical depth .",
    "likewise , the quasiperiodicity of @xmath57 , @xmath58= \\zeta(z;0,g_3)+\\frac{\\upi}{\\sqrt3\\omega}\\,\\bigl(m+n{\\mathrm e}^{-{\\upi}{\\mathrm i}/3}\\bigr)\\ ] ] where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are arbitrary integers , indicates that the vertex points @xmath16 , @xmath42 , and @xmath59 of the equilateral triangle in the lens plane map onto the source plane points : @xmath45 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 where @xmath62 so that the mean inverse magnification is again given by @xmath63 where the optical depth or the mean convergence is @xmath56 ( and the mean surface density @xmath64 of the point masses on the triangular grid is given by @xmath65 where @xmath31 is the side length of the unit triangular cell ) .",
    "we note that the the preceding two cases of the lens arrangement correspond to two of the three possible regular tessellations of the two - dimensional plane .",
    "it may be of some interest to consider the regular lens placement corresponding to the remaining regular tessellation ",
    "the hexagonal or honeycomb tiling .",
    "it turns out that the regular hexagonal grid case is closely related to the equilateral triangular grid . by removing every third of the lens that forms a ( 30-rotated ) larger triangular grid of side length of @xmath66 from the base triangular grid with side length of @xmath31 , the remaining lenses form a hexagonal grid ( or the vertices of honeycomb cells ) .",
    "consequently , the corresponding lens equation may be written as @xmath67 where @xmath68 is related to @xmath21 through equation ( [ eq : g3 ] ) provided that @xmath31 is still the side length of the base triangular grid ( and also that of the unit honeycomb cell ) .",
    "however , since every third of lens has been removed from the base triangular cell , the optical depth is reduced to @xmath69 , and thus @xmath70 in addition , @xmath71 ( the primed symbol indicates the complex differentiation , i.e. , the derivative with respect to @xmath16 ) . the function @xmath72 is studied in appendix [ app : hex ] .",
    "it is again straightforward to establish that the mean inverse magnification is @xmath63 . unlike the preceding two cases ,",
    "the system described by lens equation ( [ eq : leq_hex ] ) does not have the lens at the centre , but the centre of the system corresponds to the location on the lens plane such that @xmath73 .",
    "however , we note that this is deliberately chosen for mathematical simplicity , and does not imply any intrinsic difference of the honeycomb grid from the square or triangular grid . in particular",
    ", we note the 120-rotational symmetry of the system with respect to any lens location , which actually implies that any lens on the honeycomb grid experiences zero shear from the remaining point masses . in other words , for all three cases of the point masses on the regular grid , the total shear from all the adjacent lenses exactly cancels out at any lens position .",
    "f2.cap    f3.cap      f4.cap    while most of the lensing properties of the lattice lens can be studied using the lens equations , it is still useful to have an expression for the lensing potential for some purposes such as the time delay .",
    "although the direct infinite sum of the individual logarithmic potential of the point - mass lens is divergent everywhere , one can get around this difficulty through the known antiderivative of the weierstrass zeta function .",
    "first , we note the relation between the real potential and the complex deflection function @xcite ; the complex lens equation is given by @xmath74 if the real potential is given by @xmath3 . here , the operator @xmath75 indicates the ` wirtinger derivative ' ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with respect to @xmath76 , that is , if @xmath77 and @xmath78 , then @xmath79 because @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "for the current scenario , we have @xmath82 ( note that @xmath83 since @xmath3 is real ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath22 is a complex analytic function and so there exists a complex analytic function @xmath84 such that @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",

    "consequently , we find that the real potential up to an additive constant for the regular lensing lattice is given by @xmath92 where @xmath78 and @xmath93 is the weierstrass sigma function @xcite , which can be defined as the anti - log - derivative of the weierstrass zeta function , that is , @xmath94 . here , we have also used the property of the complex logarithm function such that @xmath95=\\ln{\\left\\lvertg\\right\\rvert}$ ] where @xmath96 is any complex - valued function . note that an additional linear term may be required to be added in the expression for the potential if the centre of the system is chosen differently from those of the lens equations discussed earlier .",
    "[ fig : pot ] shows contour plots for the equipotential lines for the potential given in equations ( [ eq : pot ] ) .",
    "as usual , the jacobian determinant of equation ( [ eq : le ] ) , ( [ eq : leq_tri ] ) or ( [ eq : leq_hex ] ) @xmath97 is the inverse magnification of the individual image at the limit of the point source .",
    "in addition , the critical curves can be found from @xmath98 or equivalently solving @xmath99 for @xmath100 with @xmath101 being a real parameter @xcite , and the caustics from their images under the mapping given by the lens equation . since @xmath34 is elliptic ( hence , biperiodic )",
    ", there exists an infinite set of critical curves and caustics although they can all be recovered from the discrete grid translation of a ` unit ' curve .",
    "the homogeneity relation of @xmath29-function indicates that @xmath102 and from equation ( [ eq : hfun ] ) that @xmath103^{-2}.\\ ] ] hence , the topography of the critical curves may be studied from the lines of constant values of @xmath104 ( square grid ) and @xmath105 ( triangular and hexagonal grid ) . in particular , the critical curves for the square ( or triangular ) lens lattice with the half - period @xmath21 are basically the curves of constant @xmath106 [ or @xmath107 rescaled by a factor of @xmath108 ( or @xmath109 ) . on the other hand , those for the honeycomb lattice",
    "are found from the curves of constant @xmath110 scaled by @xmath111 and rotated by @xmath112 . since @xmath29-functions are well - defined elliptic functions , for all three cases the critical curves are an infinite set of nonintersecting closed curves except when @xmath21 assumes a particular value at which the curves are given by infinitely extended boundary lines that divide the lens plane .",
    "f5.cap      for the square grid case , if @xmath113 [ i.e , @xmath114 , each of the critical curves is centred at the centre of a square cell defined by the four adjacent lenses ( i.e. , @xmath115 where @xmath116 and @xmath117 are odd integers ) .",
    "any image in the region ` within ' the critical curves has positive parity and vice versa . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath118 [ @xmath119 , the critical curves are centred around each lens location . for this case , the images ` within ' the critical curves now have negative parity .",
    "finally , if @xmath120 [ @xmath121 , the critical curves are given by two infinite sets of parallel diagonal lines , and the whole lens plane is evenly divided into checker - like tiled regions according to the parity of the images in them .    for @xmath122 , the lens equation maps each connected and closed ` unit ' critical curve to a caustic that is also connected and closed .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the critical curves and the caustic network for @xmath123 . like the critical curves , the whole caustic network is composed of the lattice arrangement of ` unit ' caustic curves , but the unit curve exhibits self - crossing in contrast to the critical curves .",
    "the shape of the unit caustic curve , which is roughly similar to a variant of ( irregular ) octagram ( i.e. , \\{8/3}-star - polygon - star - polygon , with @xmath117 , @xmath124 positive integers , is a figure formed by connecting with straight lines every @xmath124-th point out of regularly spaced @xmath117 points lying on a circumference .",
    "see http://mathworld.wolfram.com/starpolygon.html . ] ) , is actually generic for the case that @xmath118 .",
    "the ` centre ' of each unit caustic curve forms a similar square grid to the lens lattice but the side length of the grid on the source plane is given by @xmath125 . as @xmath21 gets larger ( or equivalently @xmath126 gets smaller ) ,",
    "the size of the caustics shrinks and they asymptotically reduce to degenerate points . for @xmath127 , the caustic network can still be understood as the lattice arrangement of ` unit ' caustic curves , the shape of which is simply described as being a diagonally stretched square .",
    "again , the separation between the centres of the unit caustics are given by @xmath128 .",
    "however , this is smaller than the ` size ' of each unit caustic if @xmath129 so that the network can exhibit overlapping among the neighboring caustics , which leads to a rather complex network ( albeit regular thanks to the symmetry of the system ) .",
    "the critical curves and caustic network for @xmath130 are shown in fig .",
    "the transition of the caustic network over @xmath120 can be understood as the contact between ( the vertices of ) adjacent quasi - octagram caustics leading to their connection .",
    "the further evolution of the caustic topography for @xmath127 is presented in fig .",
    "since the separation between the unit caustics reduces to nil as @xmath131 , the network is the densest around @xmath132 . on the other hand , as @xmath126 increases past unity",
    ", the separations between unit curves @xmath133 increase while their sizes continually decrease .",
    "consequently , the network eventually reduces an array of separate tiles of the unit caustics , which exhibit no overlap between neighboring caustics .",
    "the critical value at which the sizes of the unit caustics coincide with the separations between them is found approximately to be @xmath134 ( @xmath135 ) .",
    "f6.cap    one physical interpretation of the caustics in gravitational lensing is that they are boundaries between regions in the source plane that produce different number of images .",
    "in addition , it is also known that a pair of images of opposite parity appears or disappears whenever the source crosses the caustics , and that the number of positive parity images , if the source lies outside any caustics , is one or nil depending on the characteristics of the system .",
    "hence , the maximum number of positive parity images can be determined from examination of the caustics network .",
    "for example , the quasi - octagram caustics for @xmath118 allow at most four positive parity images in the region around the centres of caustics .",
    "it is easy to convince oneself that the minimum number of positive parity images for the corresponding scenario is one when the source lies outside any caustic .",
    "as for the case @xmath136 , the examination of the caustic network leads us to conclude that , while the maximum number of the positive images approaches infinity at @xmath52 ( i.e. , @xmath137 ) , it is greater than four only if @xmath138 . in other words ,",
    "the number of positive parity images is bounded by four provided that @xmath139 ( @xmath140 ) or that @xmath141 ( @xmath142 ) .",
    "the source positions with no positive parity image start to exist if @xmath143 or equivalently @xmath144 .",
    "finally , if @xmath145 ( @xmath146 ) , there is no overlap between neighboring caustics , and thus the number of positive parity images is one if the source lies in the caustic , and nil if otherwise .",
    "f7.cap    the lenses on an equilateral triangular lattice produce the critical curves and the caustic network in a basically consistent pattern as the square lattice lens although many details are quite different . for triangular lattices , the unit critical curves for @xmath1472)\\approx1.214",

    "[ fig1 t ] shows an example of this , the caustic network for @xmath153 .",
    "the maximum number of positive parity images associated with these unit caustics is found to be six . if @xmath154 , the unit caustics are given by stretched triangular cells , and the whole network is given by tiling the source plane with these cells , which may overlap with one another . here",
    ", the centres of each cell actually form a hexagonal ( honeycomb ) grid with side length of @xmath155 , which is in fact the mapped image of the dual grid to the lens lattice in the lens plane , and the adjacent cells alternate their orientation with their symmetry maintained .",

    "[ fig2 t ] for @xmath156 .",
    "analogous to the case of the square lattice , dense overlapping of unit caustics leads to very complex network around @xmath157 .",
    "it is found that that the critical value that corresponds to no overlap between adjacent caustics is about @xmath158 ( @xmath159 ) .",
    "the triangular lens lattice with side length less than this value ( hence a denser lattice ) produces triangular unit caustics arranged on a honeycomb grid with no overlap , and the number of positive parity images is either one or nil depending on the position of the source relative to the caustics .",
    "f8.cap      in qualitative terms , the critical curves of the honeycomb lattice are basically the ` dual ' of that of the triangular case .",
    "the critical curves for @xmath160 [ @xmath161 are analogous to those for the triangular lattice with @xmath149 and located within each hexagonal cell centred at the positions of null shear . on the other hand , if @xmath162 , the critical curves are like those for the triangular lattice with @xmath154 and centred around each lens positions .",
    "the dual characteristic further indicates that there are twice more poles than the locations of null shear ( which are in fact fourth - order zeros ) , and thus there is one - to - two correspondence between unit critical curves of the former to the latter ( formally , the ` winding number ' of the former is twice that of the latter ) .",
    "on the other hand , the caustics of a honeycomb lattice are qualitatively distinct from those of a triangular lattice .",
    "[ fig1h ] shows an example for a sparse honeycomb lattice with @xmath163 , which is in fact archetypal for @xmath162 .",
    "the unit caustics are given by a six - sided closed self - intersecting curve , which may be labeled a bi - triangle , and they are arranged in a similar hexagonal pattern as the lattice of the lens with side length @xmath125 .",
    "we also note that the maximum number of positive parity images associated with these caustics is three . for a dense honeycomb lens lattice ( @xmath164 )",
    ", the unit caustics are found to be in the shape of a stretched hexagon ( an example of which for @xmath165 is given in fig .",
    "[ fig2h ] ) and arranged in a triangular grid with side length of @xmath166 .",
    "they also exhibit trends of varying overlap similar to the square or triangular lattice , as @xmath126 gets larger past the unity .",
    "we find that the critical value for no overlapping caustics for the honeycomb lattice is approximately given by @xmath167 ( @xmath168 ) .    despite their variety",
    ", we also notice some common characteristics of the caustic networks of three kinds of regular lensing lattices . for example , with an optical depth that is greater than a certain critical value , the unit curves are more or less in a similar shape as the lensing lattice except for the fact that they are distorted in a way stretching the vetices radially outward .",
    "they densely overlap with one another around @xmath129 .",
    "however , as @xmath126 gets larger past the unity , their size shrink whereas the separations among them grow , and so the networks eventually reduce to a simple array of tiles .",
    "likewise , towards the lower optical depths below the critical value , the networks are comprised of star - shaped unit curves whose exact characteristics are related to meeting pattern of the lensing lattice at the common vertex points .",
    "f9.cap    the area in the caustic accounting for its multiplicity can be understood as the covering fraction of the source plane by the region with ` extra image ' pairs once it is properly normalized . in general",
    ", however , the normalization is ill - defined for localized lenses .",
    "this difficulty is ameliorated with the introduction of the lattice of point masses since the whole plane is now evenly divided into identical cells . with the regular lensing lattice",
    ", the area under the unit caustic can be properly normalized with respect to the area of the mapped image ( on the source plane ) of the unit cell comprising the lensing lattice .",
    "the result , if the multiplicity is properly accounted for , is actually the mean number of extra image pairs , which has been calculated for the case of the random star field using techniques from the probability theory @xcite .",
    "f10.cap    for ` dense ' lattices that produce nonintersecting ( but possibly overlapping ) unit caustics , the relevant area under the unit caustics is straightforward to calculate since , despite overlapping , they are simply reduced to a set of closed loops .",
    "then , the area under one such loop normalized to the area of a unit cell in the source plane , @xmath169 where @xmath170 is the area under the unit cell defined by the adjacent lens positions in the lens plane , is the mean number both of extra image pairs and of positive parity images for a given source position because the corresponding critical curves in the image plane completely enclose the region where any positive images reside and thus there are no positive images formed ` outside ' of any caustics . on the other hand , for ` sparse ' lattices that produce the network composed of a grid set of self - intersecting ` star - shaped ' curves , the self - crossing of the unit structures requires some consideration on the meaning of ` area ' that properly accounts for the image multiplicity .",
    "we argue that the solution is rather simple .",
    "once the area calculation is reduced to the line integral along its boundary ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) using the fundamental theorem of multivariate calculus , the corresponding line integral along the caustic actually results in the area counted with multiplicity .",
    "that is to say , they can be considered as the ` area - excess ' or the ` over - covering factor ' of the source positions that produce positive parity images . unlike the previous case",
    ", the normalization cell in the lens plane is the unit cell of the dual of the lensing lattice , i.e. , the cell defined by the adjacent null shear locations ( which is in fact the centre of each cell of the lensing lattice ) .",
    "the corresponding critical curves lie completely within this unit normalization cell and furthermore enclose the regions of the image plane where negative parity images reside .",
    "subsequently , there is at least one positive parity image for any given source position  that is , the source ` outside ' caustics forms one positive parity image . as a result , the mean number of extra image pairs is less than the number of positive parity images by one .",
    "we note that the mean number of positive parity images actually varies continuously over the critical value dividing the dense lattice from the sparse one while the mean number of extra image pairs jumps by one .",
    "in fact , designating a certain image pair as an extra involves some degrees of arbitrariness whereas counting the number of positive parity images is well - defined . for these reasons , henceforth , we shall discuss the mean number of positive parity images exclusively .",

    "is much less likely to occur than in the highly symmetric arrangement of the lenses , for which there may be significant chances that the image is located at an exactly balanced position where the net shear is null .",
    "this is basically the reason for slower fall - offs of the mean number of positive parity images in dense square or honeycomb lattices . from equation ( [ eq : gdis ] ) , if the shear distribution behaves like @xmath205 as @xmath206 where @xmath207 is a constant , @xmath208 is the asymptotic power index for the shear distribution and @xmath20 is the order of the zeros of the shear , then equation ( [ eq : intg ] ) as @xmath171 reduces to @xmath209 since the last integral is a finite constant for @xmath210 , we find that @xmath211 as @xmath171 , which is consistent with the results found earlier ( fig .",

    "first , the lens equations indicate that @xmath260 , which implies that , in order to have an image that is arbitrarily far from the source , the image position should be rather close to the lens , that is , the poles of @xmath22 , at which @xmath22 is divergent .",
    "if we consider the lens mapping from the point @xmath261 where @xmath262 is one of the lens locations , then the lens equation ( [ eq : lea ] ) reduces to @xmath263 where @xmath264 . here , we use the quasiperiodic relation of @xmath22 [ which is inherited from that of @xmath37 ] and some additional properties of the weierstrass zeta function .",

    "additional locations of negative parity images are also found from the iteration given by equation ( [ eq : sec2 ] ) with starting points given by a grid of positions near @xmath291 .",
    "next , we consider the effect of the large - scale potential .",
    "it is a usual practice that the external potential @xmath12 in equation ( [ eq : leq ] ) is approximated by a quadratic function and consequently the corresponding deflection by a linear function ( i.e. , tensor )  that is , keeping only the linear terms in its taylor - series expansion @xcite .",
    "the resulting linear function is symmetric , thanks to the mixed coordinate differential being commutative .",
    "it is also customary that the linear function is decomposed into a scalar dilation and a traceless tensor .",
    "the former , usually referred to as a convergence , is directly related to the surface mass density ( which is not in the form of point masses ) whereas the latter , known as an external shear , physically models the tidal effects from the external mass distribution .",
    "in complex number notation , then the lens equation generalizes to @xmath292-\\bar\\gamma_c\\bigr\\rvert^2\\ ] ] where @xmath293 , which must be positive real , is the convergence due to the local surface mass density that is the source of the large scale potential ( i.e. , ` continuous mass density ' ) and @xmath294 , which can be any complex number , is the shear that models the tidal effect .",
    "the effect of the convergence term is uniform focusing , which basically results in a scaling difference between the image and source planes .",
    "it is usually incorporated into the analysis by the redefinition of the variables @xcite .",
    "for example , with the rescaled position variables for the image plane @xmath295 and the source plane @xmath296 where @xmath297 , equation ( [ eq : lcs ] ) for the square lattice with side length of @xmath21 [ i.e. , @xmath298 reduces to @xmath299 where @xmath300 is the reduced shear .",
    "we note that the deflection function is basically given by that for the square lattice with side length of @xmath301 ( i.e. , corresponding to the reduced optical depth @xmath302 ) . in general , if @xmath303 ( i.e. , @xmath304 ) , the qualitative lensing behaviour is basically same as the case that @xmath305 except the additional scaling difference between the image and the source planes , which leads to the use of the ` reduced ' values of the external shear and the optical depth @xcite . for the following discussion ,",
    "we only consider the lens equation ( [ eq : lcs ] ) for the case @xmath305 .",
    "f16.cap    the critical curves and the caustic networks of the lattice lens with external shear can be found in the same way as the case without external shear .",
    "however , the shear introduces two further degrees of freedom in the parameter space to be explored , which makes the task quite extensive and difficult to generalize .",
    "nevertheless , we can draw a rough generalization such that the patterns reduce to the case of the chang - refsdal lens @xcite if @xmath306 and to the simple lattices with no ( or negligible ) shear if @xmath307 .",
    "[ fig6]-[fig8 ] show some examples of the critical curves and the caustic networks for the square lattices with moderate values of @xmath308 and @xmath126 to illustrate the effects of varying @xmath126 at fixed @xmath294 or varying @xmath294 ( both the magnitude and the orientation ) at fixed @xmath126 .",
    "the situation becomes quite complicated if @xmath309 .",
    "as in the case of lattices with zero shear , with @xmath132 , there are overlaps among neighboring caustics .",
    "furthermore , with nonzero shear , neighboring caustics can be connected with one another , and the resulting dense networks of caustics are even more complicated to analyze properly",
    ". more detailed analysis of these will be attempted in a subsequent work .    instead",
    ", here we speculate on some possible connections of lattice lensing to more realistic lensing scenarios ( particularly , that of the random star field ) .",
    "one of the most significant differences of lattice lensing from that by a random field is the fact that the shear experienced at any given lens position due to the remaining lenses cancels out to be null . adding external shear",
    "only alters the situation minimally , that is , the total shear at any lens position is shifted to the value of external shear but every lens still experiences the identical shear . by contrast , in the random star field , the shear experienced by a given star is distributed according to the same distribution as that of the shear experienced by the random lines of sight .",
    "however , we note that the latter distribution has been calculated @xcite using the straightforward application of the characteristic function in the probability theory and the random - walk process .",
    "if lattice lensing were to model the effect of the shear ` variations ' in the random field reasonably well , each individual lens in the random field might be approximated as a lattice lens with the ` external shear ' being equal to the actual total shear experienced by the given lens .",
    "then , the lensing behaviour of the whole of the random star field could be understood as the sort of ` convolution ' of the lattice lens ( of the corresponding optical depth ) with the external shear distributed as the distribution of the random shear in the random star field .",
    "if this indeed be the case , one could study more realistic scenarios of the microlensing effects due to the stars in the lensing galaxy in an alternative way to the traditional inverse ray tracing approach .",
    "f17.cap    at this point , however , this remains a speculative possibility .",
    "as it has been noted widely , the effects of many lenses combine in a highly nonlinear fashion and the role of the individual lenses even in the simplest phenomenology is nontrivial ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "while one could expect that the approach of decomposing the star field into lattices outlined in the previous paragraph might fare better than the simplistic approach of seeing the star field as the combination of individual stars ( since it takes care of some of the nonlinear effects ) , no compelling argument can yet be made that this is the case .",
    "microlensing at high optical depth is not only of a theoretical interest but also of an importance in understanding a number of lensed systems ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , at present time , the only way to get any detailed quantitative grip on such problem is via monte - carlo simulations of each individual point corresponding specific values of the optical depth and the external shear ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is rather expensive in its requirement for resources .",
    "we argue that a grid of point masses discussed in this paper , while artificial and abstract so that it may appear to be entirely divorced from any physically realistic problem , can provide us with some insight , albeit indirect , into what is at work in microlensing at high optical depth , in particular for the numbers and magnifications of microimages .",
    "together with with various analytical methods and probabilistic approaches to the problem , this help us build pictures of phenomena complement to more traditional routes with comparatively inexpensive means .",

    "here , we summarize some basic concepts and properties of elliptic functions and the weierstrass functions that are related to the expositions given in the main text . for a general but concise introduction to the subject , we refer to online resources such as wolfram mathworld or standard references on special functions such as @xcite . for more detailed and rigorous ( and modern ) treatments ,",
    "we advise our reader to look upon advanced texts on the complex analysis ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or the analytic number theory ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , particularly those on the theory of the elliptic curves and/or modular functions / forms ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , large collections of formulae involving the weierstrass functions are also available online ( e.g. , the wolfram functions site ) .",
    "elliptic functions are the class of complex - valued functions of a complex variable that are meromorphic ( i.e. , analytic everywhere in the complex plane except isolated poles ) and biperiodic ( or ` doubly - periodic ' ) .",
    "the biperiodicity means that there exist two complex numbers @xmath310 and @xmath311 such that @xmath312 is not real and @xmath313 for all pairs of integers @xmath19 and @xmath20 and any complex number @xmath16 . here ,",
    "the two complex numbers @xmath310 and @xmath311 are referred to as the half - periods of the elliptic function if they are a pair of two ` smallest ' such numbers .",
    "being half - periods , many modern mathematical references adopt the different convention such that @xmath314 and the related arguments represent the periods . ] we note that the biperiodicity further implies that , once the behaviour of the function is known in the domain that is the parallelogram ` cell ' whose vertices are @xmath315 , @xmath316 , @xmath317 and @xmath318 ( or equivalently @xmath319 , @xmath320 , @xmath321 , @xmath322 ) , it is completely specified everywhere in the complex plane .",
    "the cell is sometime referred to as the fundamental period parallelogram ( fpp ) of the elliptic function . according to the general theory of elliptic functions , any elliptic function can be expressed using a set of standard functions , which are usually chosen to be one of two classes : jacobi functions ( @xmath323 , @xmath324 , @xmath325 and so on ) or the weierstrass @xmath29-function and its derivative .",
    "the weierstrass @xmath29-function ( or ` the ' weierstrass elliptic function ) is the elliptic function that has one second - order pole in its fpp .",
    "the standard definition locates a pole at @xmath326 whose principal part is exactly @xmath327 and constant part is nil ( i.e. , @xmath328=0 $ ] ) .",
    "the formal definition is given by @xmath329\\ ] ] where @xmath330 , and the summation is over all integer grid points of @xmath285 except @xmath331 . here ,",
    "the set of all complex numbers in the form of @xmath262 is usually referred to as a lattice .",
    "note that the function @xmath25 has second - order poles at every point of the lattice .",
    "in addition , @xmath25 is an even function , i.e. , @xmath332 .",
    "note that , for a given lattice , the choice of the pair of the half - periods is not unique  that is to say , the lattice forms a module over the ring of integers and the set of two periods ( i.e. , @xmath333 ) is the basis of this module .",
    "for this reason , the two secondary arguments of @xmath25 are usually replaced by the elliptic invariants defined by @xmath334 and @xmath335 such that @xmath336 . unlike a pair of the half - periods , the elliptic invariants are in fact uniquely specified by the given lattice , and vice versa .",
    "the elliptic invariants are directly related to the coefficients of the laurent - series expansion of @xmath29-function at origin via simple algebraic relations , that is , the coefficients are given by the polynomials of @xmath187 and @xmath68 .",
    "particularly , we have @xmath337 .",
    "this series expansion further indicates that @xmath338 ^ 2 - 4[\\wp(z;g_2,g_3)]^3-g_2\\wp(z;g_2,g_3 ) = g_3+\\mathscr o(z^2)$ ] .",
    "this combined with the results from the general theory of elliptic functions implies that @xmath339 is a particular solution of the differential equation given by @xmath340 .",
    "since this is a first - order differential equation that does not involve the independent variable , its general solution is given by @xmath341 where @xmath38 is an integration constant ( which is an arbitrary complex constant ) .",
    "note that , if the polynomial @xmath342 can be factored with a perfect square factor ( so that @xmath343 ) , the solution of the differential equation then can be expressed in terms of ` elementary ' functions such as trigonometric or hyperbolic functions and so does the weierstrass function . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath344 and @xmath345 are both nonzero real [ i.e. , @xmath346 , then @xmath347 - 2e & \\text{if $ e>0$}\\\\ ( -3e)\\cot^2[(-3e)^{1/2}z]+(-2e ) & \\text{if $ e<0 $ } \\end{cases}.\\ ] ] however , this case actually corresponds ( at least , formally ) to @xmath348 or @xmath349 , and the resulting functions are not elliptic but simply ( singly-)periodic [ unless @xmath350 , for which @xmath351 and @xmath352 so that it is in fact aperiodic ] .    the derivative of @xmath29-function @xmath353 is also an elliptic function with the same half - periods as @xmath354 but it has third - order poles at the lattice points and is an odd function .",
    "by contrast , the antiderivative ( or the indefinite integral ) of @xmath29-function can not be an elliptic function . according to the general theory of elliptic functions ,",
    "the sum of complex residues in fpp of any elliptic function must vanish .",
    "however , if the antiderivative of @xmath29-function were an elliptic function , it would have a single simple pole in its fpp and thus the sum of its residues could not vanish .",
    "in fact , the weierstrass @xmath355-function - function should not be confused with several other mathematical functions conventionally denoted by the same symbols , the most important among which is the riemann @xmath355-function and its generalization , the hurwitz @xmath355-function .",

    "we also note that the weierstrass @xmath355-function is an odd function .",
    "in addition , the theory of the weierstrass functions also introduces another auxiliary function referred to as the weierstrass @xmath64-function ; @xmath358\\ ] ] where the product is again over all integer pairs @xmath285 except @xmath331 . from this definition , it is straightforward to show that @xmath37 is the log - derivative of @xmath359 , that is , @xmath360 we note that @xmath359 is also a quasiperiodic function although the relation involves the successive ratios between the functional values at the points separated by the ` period ' , rather than the differences as in @xmath37 ; @xmath361 ( z+m\\omega_1+n\\omega_3)\\right\\}\\ ] ] where @xmath362 and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are any pair of integers .",
    "the function @xmath359 is in fact an entire function , that is , it is analytic everywhere in the complex plane without any pole or singularity ( except the essential singularity at infinity ) . in particular , it has zeros at the origin and the lattice points , that is , @xmath363 , which is easily verifiable from its definition .",
    "we also note that the set of weierstrass functions satisfy the homogeneity relations , which can be easily derived from their respective definitions in terms of the infinite sum or product over the lattice points .",
    "in particular , @xmath364 @xmath365 where @xmath366 is a complex constant .        if fpp is a square ( i.e. , @xmath367 ) , then @xmath368 and , from the symmetry , we have @xmath369 , and so that @xmath370 .",
    "then , after @xmath187 is reduced to the unity using the homogeneity relation , the behaviour of the corresponding weierstrass elliptic function can be studied through that of @xmath371 , which is called the lemniscatic case . the corresponding half - periods of @xmath372 are given by @xmath373 and @xmath374 .",
    "( the constant @xmath375 is sometimes known as the lemniscate constant . )",
    "some basic results known for the lemniscatic case are @xmath376 here , @xmath377 is in fact the only zero of @xmath371 within its fpp ( which is actually a degenerate second - order zero ) .",
    "note that these zeros are located at the centres of the square cells defined by the poles .",
    "we further note that the behaviours of these functions within fpp exhibit high degrees of symmetry and their study can be reduced to the one - eighth of fpp , that is , the isosceles - right - triangular region defined by @xmath326 ( the pole ) , @xmath378 and @xmath195 ( the zero ) .    although the standard reference on the numerical calculation , @xcite , does not list the routine for the weierstrass functions , their numerical evaluation is available in commercial softwares such as mathematica@xmath379 or maple@xmath380 or subroutine libraries such as imsl@xmath380 .",
    "however , for most purposes , they can be evaluated in a pretty straightforward manner without using any black - box routine ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "while there exist more involved algorithms that are valid for an arbitrary pair of complex numbers @xmath381 , the lemniscatic case of the weierstrass function can be easily evaluated through its laurent - series expansion at @xmath326 or taylor - series expansion at @xmath382 or @xmath383 ( after the reduction of the domain using biperiodicity and additional symmetry properties ) .",
    "the relevant series expansions up to the first several terms are available in @xcite .",
    "in particular , the laurent series at @xmath326 is given in the form of @xmath384 $ ] ( the first few coefficients @xmath385 s of which are given in table [ tab : co ] ) so that it converges relatively quickly for @xmath386  the radius of the convergence of the series is in fact @xmath387 .",
    "note that the coefficients for the laurent series at @xmath326 can in fact be derived using a total recurrence relation .",
    "since the lemniscatic case of @xmath29-function satisfies the differential equation @xmath388 , its inverse function is expressible through elliptic integrals .",
    "however , the relevant integral in fact more easily reduces to an incomplete beta function @xmath389 or a hypergeometric function , @xmath390 where @xmath391 is the incomplete beta function and @xmath392 is the gaussian @xmath393-hypergeometric function .",
    "[ c.f . , @xmath394 .",
    "] here , the last expression may be used for a convergent hypergeometric power - series expansion for the inverse @xmath29-function for @xmath395 .",
    "we note that , because we are interested in the case when @xmath29 takes an arbitrary complex value , there is no particular advantage using the legendre / jacobi elliptic integrals or the incomplete beta function , numerical or otherwise , compared to the hypergeometric series expression given above .",
    "alternative convergent hypergeometric series for @xmath396 also exists ; @xmath397 where @xmath398 is again the zero of @xmath371 .",
    "the inverse function can be effectively evaluated almost everywhere using these hypergeometric series together with some further refinement methods such as the ( complex ) newton - raphson algorithm if necessary .",
    "we note that fpp can be considered as a tile , the set of which covers the whole ( complex ) plane and the locations of the poles are vertices of individual tiles",
    ". then , the preceding lemniscatic case corresponds to the tile given by a square ( i.e , a regular tetra - gon ) , which is one of the three possible regular tessellations of the plane .",
    "the elliptic function with fpp corresponding to the tile pattern of the remaining two regular tessellations can also be studied similarly .",
    "the half - periods for the more basic of the two , that is , the tiles given by equilateral triangles , are related to each other via @xmath399 and then from the symmetry of the system , it follows that @xmath400 ( note that , while the choice of the two half - periods is not unique , the elliptic invariants are fixed for the given arrangement of poles ) . as before",
    ", the remaining invariant @xmath68 can be reduced to the unity using the homogeneity relation , and the resulting weierstrass elliptic function , @xmath401 is referred to as the equiharmonic case .",
    "it is known that the real half - period of @xmath402 is @xmath403 .",
    "additionally , it can be derived that @xmath404 the zeros of @xmath401 are found at the centres of each equilateral triangular cells so that there are actually two zeros within its fpp , and unlike the lemniscatic case , each zero is simple ( i.e. , the first - order zero ) .",
    "the particular zero within the cell defined by @xmath326 , @xmath405 , and @xmath406 is located at @xmath407 with @xmath408 . like the lemniscatic case",
    ", the equiharmonic case of the weierstrass function can also be readily evaluated via the power - series expansions at @xmath326 , @xmath409 , or @xmath383 .",
    "their coefficients are again found in the references such as @xcite .",
    "in fact , the laurent - series expansion at @xmath326 of the equiharmonic case ( whose radius of convergence is @xmath410 ) is in the form of @xmath411 $ ] , which converges even faster than that of the lemniscatic case for @xmath386 .",
    "the first few coefficient @xmath412 s are again given in table [ tab : co ] .",
    "analogous to the lemniscatic case , the inverse of @xmath29-function can be obtained through the integration of the differential equation @xmath413 .",
    "the resulting expression can again be written down in terms of elliptic integrals ( which is rather complicated ) , incomplete beta functions , or hypergeometric functions , @xmath414 similarly , the last expression can be used for the convergent hypergeometric power - series expansion of the inverse @xmath29-function for @xmath415 .",
    "for the case when @xmath416 , an alternative expression involving a hypergeometric function can be derived as before ; @xmath417 here , @xmath407 is again the zero of @xmath401 .",
    "the sign in front of the hypergeometric function is actually dependent upon the choice of @xmath195 .",
    "for example , with an alternative zero @xmath418 , it should be positive .",
    "again , these hypergeometric series supplemented by the newton - raphson algorithm provide an efficient way to evaluate the inverse @xmath29-function for the equiharmonic case .",
    "let us consider an elliptic function , @xmath419 note that every pole of @xmath420 coincides with that of @xmath193 and they cancel each other leaving a fourth - order zero at the location .",
    "on the other hand , the remaining poles of @xmath193 are located at the vertices of regular hexagonal tiles .",
    "hence , equation ( [ eq : hex ] ) corresponds to the remaining case of the elliptic function with their ( second - order ) poles forming vertex points of the regular tessellation of the space .",
    "while it is a straightforward calculation , equation  ( [ eq : hex ] ) is unsuitable for the accurate numerical evaluation near @xmath326 ( and also near the other zeros of the functions ) because of the canceling of two divergent terms leading to the zero .",
    "furthermore , the inversion of equation  ( [ eq : hex ] ) is also rather nontrivial .",
    "this difficulty can be overcome as follows .",
    "we first note that @xmath421 ^ 2 & = \\bigl[\\mathfrak p'(z)\\bigr]^2\\ , \\biggl(1-\\frac{2g_3}{27\\bigl[\\mathfrak p(z)\\bigr]^3}\\biggr)^2 \\\\&=\\biggl(4\\bigl[\\mathfrak p(z)\\bigr]^3+\\frac{g_3}{27}\\biggr)\\ , \\biggl(1-\\frac{2g_3}{27\\bigl[\\mathfrak p(z)\\bigr]^3}\\biggr)^2 = 4\\bigl[\\mathfrak q(z)\\bigr]^3-g_3 \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath422^{-2}$ ] and @xmath423 . in other words",
    ", @xmath424 is the solution of the differential equation @xmath425 , whose general solution is in the form of @xmath426 where @xmath38 is the ( complex ) integration constant . since the principal part of the laurent - series expansion of @xmath424 at @xmath326 is @xmath327 , it is in fact the case that @xmath427 , and consequently we have @xmath428^{-2 } = \\frac1{u^4}\\biggl(\\frac{g_3}{27}\\biggr)^{1/3}\\biggl[\\wp\\biggl ( u\\bigl(\\frac{g_3}{27}\\bigr)^{1/6}z;0,1\\biggr)\\biggr]^{-2}\\ ] ] where @xmath429 .",
    "subsequently , we find that the inverse function of equation ( [ eq : hex ] ) or equivalently that of equation ( [ eq : hfun ] ) is given by @xmath430 or @xmath431 where some of signs are chosen so that the principal value for positive real values of @xmath196 returns with being positive real ( in particular , @xmath432 ) .    on the other hand , if one wants to find the taylor - series expansion of @xmath72 at @xmath326 , it may be easier to use equation ( [ eq : hex ] ) at @xmath326 directly ; @xmath433 \\left(\\frac{g_3}{28}\\right)^kb_kz^{6k-2 } \\\\&=\\frac{g_3}{27}z^4\\left\\{1+\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\left[\\sum_{p=0}^k(-1)^{k - p}27^p\\right ] b_{k+1}\\left(\\frac{g_3}{27\\cdot28}z^6\\right)^k\\right\\ } \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath412 is the laurent - series coefficient of the equiharmonic case of @xmath29-function ( see table [ tab : co ] ) .",
