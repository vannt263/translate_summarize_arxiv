    "nine years ago in paper @xcite it was noted that contrary to the common belief expressed in review paper @xcite the precision electroweak data do not exclude the existence of extra quark - lepton generations . a year after in important paper",
    "@xcite it was found that heavy higgs boson does not contradict electroweak data as soon as extra generation exists .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is twofold .",
    "firstly , to update old results taking into account the present values of electroweak observables . secondly , the existence of the fourth generation does not contradict precision data even if the mass of new neutral lepton is much larger than @xmath4 contrary to the statement of the update of @xcite published in @xcite .",
    "in table 1 we present the results of the data fit performed by leptop code @xcite .",
    "* table 1 *    [ cols=\"<,<,<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     _ quark and lepton contributions to @xmath5 and @xmath6 at the points of @xmath7 minimum in figures 1,2 and 3 .",
    "all masses are in gev . _    for heavy higgs",
    "the mass of a neutral lepton is close to @xmath4 , that is why the values of @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 considerably differ from @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 . for light higgs ( @xmath14 gev ) the masses of all new fermions are far from @xmath4 , that is why @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 almost coincide with @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .    in order to get whether these sets of the fourth generation particle masses are allowed by precision data in the framework of @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 approach , we should look at fig .",
    "10.4 from @xcite .",
    "standard model corresponds to @xmath15 , and this point is just at the border of 90 % c.l . allowed domain for @xmath16 gev .",
    "summing quarks and leptons contributions for the fourth generation point with @xmath17 gev we get @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "it is at the border of the same domain , so its level of @xmath7 is the same as in the case of sm  the result coinciding with that of @xmath20 analysis presented in section 3 .",
    "next we should consider the point with heavy higgs , @xmath21 gev . at this point @xmath22 , @xmath23 , which is a bit outside the allowed domain for 1000 gev higgs from fig .",
    "however since at this point @xmath24 , @xmath25 we see that primed quantities are again at the border of 90 % c.l .",
    "allowed domain .",
    "the possibility to include an extra quark - lepton generation(s ) into standard model has been studied .",
    "we have found that the electroweak data do not contradict the existence of one extra family with specially adjusted masses .",
    "three examples corresponding to light and heavy higgs bosons are presented . the properly made analysis based on @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 ( for @xmath17 gev ) and",
    "@xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 ( for @xmath21 gev ) confirms the results of the analysis based on @xmath20 .",
    "let us note that in paper @xcite a set of masses of the fourth generation particles was found which pass electroweak tests and corresponds to @xmath26 gev .",
    "this paper is an expanded version of the presentation at the `` beyond the 3 sm generation at the lhc era '' workshop at cern , september 4 - 5 2008 .",
    "we dedicate it to lev okun , who initiated our common electroweak project many years ago .",
