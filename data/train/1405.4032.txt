    "red supergiants ( rsgs ) represent an important but still poorly characterized evolutionary phase of massive stars . as he - burning evolved stars , their surfaces present very cool effective temperatures between 3400 and 4100 k ( spectral type of late - k to m ) and average luminosities 20  000 to 300  000 @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "rsgs are amongst the largest stars , with radii up to 1500 @xmath1 and masses in the 10 - 25 @xmath2 range @xcite .",
    "the resulting low gravity has the consequence that material from the outer envelope can easily escape to the interstellar medium , giving rise to circumstellar envelopes @xcite and very significant mass - loss rates ranging between @xmath3 to @xmath4 @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the actual mechanism of the mass loss is still unknown but is likely to involve the combined effects of turbulent pressure from large convection cells and radiation pressure on molecular lines @xcite , as well as stellar magnetism @xcite and alfvn winds @xcite . through these processes , rsgs are key agents of nucleosynthesis and chemical enrichment of the galaxy .    in the last decade , photometric and spectroscopic observations have allowed several breakthroughs in our understanding of their dynamical convective patterns .",
    "rsgs have long been known for their semi - regular short term optical variations with periods of the order of hundreds of days @xcite .",
    "historically , this variability was usually attributed to radial pulsation , and while this path is still being investigated @xcite , the full explanation is now thought to involve variation of a few large granules on the surface of the rsgs .",
    "such huge convection cells are suggested by theory and simulations @xcite , and supported by recent spectroscopic observations that detected large amounts of material moving through the photosphere of rsgs @xcite .",
    "modeling these convection effects requires a precise determination of the temperature of the rsgs .",
    "the last decade of measurements of effective temperatures of rsgs seemed to indicate much cooler temperatures than predicted by stellar evolutionary theory , until @xcite used marcs stellar atmosphere models with state - of - the art ( at the time ) treatment of molecular opacities @xcite to fit moderate - resolution optical spectrophotometry of galactic rsgs .",
    "they derived a warmer effective temperature scale for rsgs of galactic metallicity than previous studies , in rough agreement with the geneva evolutionary tracks @xcite .",
    "long - baseline interferometry brings unique insights to the study of rsgs . because optically resolving rsgs by interferometry gives direct access to their angular diameters , it is complementary to spectrophotometry . in a recently published survey of  @xmath6 rsgs with the palomar testbed interferometer ( pti ) ,",
    "@xcite thus derived a slightly warmer temperature scale than that of @xcite .",
    "convection processes are involved in the creation of hotspots , and determining how the formation and evolution of hotspots is correlated to the fundamental stellar parameters is a difficult task .",
    "the presence of spots and large convection cells affects the estimation of these fundamental parameters , as it leads to short - term photometric variability @xcite in addition to long - term effects @xcite , while also producing photocenter shifts that throw off diameter determination @xcite .",
    "high angular resolutions techniques are becoming essential tools to understand these hotspots .",
    "using aperture masking at the william herschel telescope , @xcite and @xcite found bright asymmetries at visible wavelengths on the surface of m - supergiants ( @xmath7 ori @xmath7  sco , @xmath7  her ) , with timescale variations of order a few months possibly explained by the presence of hotspots . due to its large angular size , @xmath7",
    "ori then became the best - studied individual rsg in terms of multi - wavelength surface imaging .",
    "using the coast interferometer , @xcite found a strong variation in the apparent asymmetry as a function of wavelength , with the detection of hotspots in the visible , but only featureless disk in j - band .",
    "this has led to the suggestion that the bright spots are unobscured regions of elevated temperature , seen through a geometrically - extended and line - blanketed atmosphere , in which the features are seen along lines of sight for which the atmospheric opacity has been reduced as the result of activity ( e.g. convection ) at the stellar surface . in h or j band , the continuum opacity is close to minimum in these cool atmospheres @xcite , one would expect to see the photosphere , with negligible or no evidence of hotspots at this band .",
    "however , interferometric observations of agb stars ( somewhat less massive and less luminous than rsgs ) have revealed that a significant fraction of these present strong closure phase signals @xcite .",
    "these signals may be explained by unresolved bright spots , though circumstellar emission could not ruled out .",
    "while the envelopes and dust shells of several rsgs have been successfully imaged and shown to be very often asymmetric @xcite , resolving actual surface features has proved more difficult .",
    "it is only recently that @xcite reported the unambiguous detection of two hotspots on @xmath7 ori by the iota interferometer in h band , while @xcite found a similar number of spots in the same band on vx  sgr using with vlti / amber .",
    "these spots are thought to be the imprint of giant convection cells based on 3d stellar convection models @xcite .",
    "we present in section [ sec : obs ] of this paper our observations of two rsgs from the per ob1 association , t  per and rs  per , using the world - leading resolution of the chara array to resolve their surface in h - band .",
    "then in section  [ sec : modeling ] we attempt to model the stellar surface asymmetries as spots , and we devise a procedure to determine the probabilities of these models based on state - of - the - art bayesian techniques . using our best estimates of the stellar diameters , we then derive the linear sizes , bolometric fluxes , and temperatures of both stars . finally in section  [ sec : image_reconstruction ] we present model - independent images of both rsgs obtained with the latest version of the software squeeze and a new regularizer developed for spotted star reconstruction .",

    "our observations were carried out on five nights in july - august 2007 at the georgia state university center for high angular resolution astronomy ( chara ) interferometer array using the michigan infra - red combiner ( mirc ) .",
    "the chara array , located on mount wilson , consists of six 1  m telescopes .",
    "thanks to its 15  baselines ranging from 34 m to 331 m , it achieves the highest angular resolution of optical interferometers , up to @xmath160.5 mas in @xmath17  band @xcite .    the michigan infrared combiner ( mirc ) instrument was used to combine the h - band light ( @xmath18-@xmath19 m ) of four chara telescopes at low spectral resolution ( r=@xmath20 ) .",
    "this provided six visibilities , four closure phases , and four triple amplitudes simultaneously in each of the eight 30-nm wide spectral channels @xcite . using the same w1-w2-s2-e2 configuration of chara that was used for surface imaging of altair @xcite , we achieved adequate ( _ u , v _ ) coverage of each target for imaging .",
    "the longest baseline in this configuration is  @xmath21  m , corresponding to a resolution of  @xmath22 mas at  @xmath23 m . we secured 4 data blocks for rs  per and 3 for t  per , each data block corresponding to a continuous observation of a target during about 20  minutes .",
    "the data were reduced by the latest version of the mirc pipeline written by john monnier ( as of november 2012 ) and previously described in @xcite .",
    "the pipeline computes the squared visibilities using fourier transforms , then averages them .",

    "our targets were observed along reference calibrators to correct for the usual transfer function variations that occur during the night due to atmospheric and optical changes in the beam path @xcite .",
    "our observations were typical of july - august weather , with transfer functions remaining very stable ( less than 0.2 drop in visibility during the nights ) .",
    "the calibrators were modeled as uniform discs as indicated in table  [ tab : calibrators ] .",
    "note that @xmath24  and has recently been resolved by mirc as a binary ; however the flux ratio of the components is greater than 1:100 and thus this does not significantly impact our calibration .    as the brightness distributions of both targets",
    "is not expected to vary significantly during our observing run ( see table  [ tab : calibrators ] for the exact observing dates ) , all nights were combined into a single data file for each target , resulting in data sets that total 419 power spectra and 264 bispectra for t  per and 523 power spectra and 326 bispectra for rs  per .",
    "systematic errors are taken into account by applying additive and multiplicative errors on the data .",
    "all the following nominal values were determined based on the expertise of the mirc group with mirc 2007 data ( monnier , private comm . ) , and based on the in - depth study of @xmath8  and data acquired during the same nights @xcite .",
    "additive errors , that correct for biases at low fringe contrast were set to @xmath25 for squared visibilities and @xmath26 for triple amplitudes .",
    "multiplicative errors , that correct for the uncertainties in the transfer function , were @xmath27 on squared visibilities and @xmath28 on triple amplitudes .",
    "based on the analysis of the closure phase statistics made by @xcite , an error floor of @xmath29 is chosen on closure phases . to account for the unreliability of closure estimation at low flux , each closure error",
    "is further increased by @xmath30 degrees , where @xmath31 is the signal - to - noise of the corresponding triple amplitude . finally , to account for the difficulty of estimating rapidly varying closures , an error equal to 10% of the closure gradient in the spectral domain is further added .",

    "fitness is a straightforward combination of grid search to identify the global @xmath32 minima and levenberg - marquardt to refine the parameters .",
    "the best fits were obtained for the linear law and the hestroffer power law @xcite , but they both show the existence of a strong covariance between the limb - darkened angular diameter and the limb - darkening coefficient . the issue is illustrated on figure  [ fig : ldd ] ( top ) , where the reduced @xmath32 surface is plotted as a function of both parameters . for both targets , the problem is mainly due to the lack of high signal - to - noise data on the first visibility lobes . to increase the precision of the fit on the angular diameter , the limb - darkening coefficients have to be constrained .",
    "@xcite reported successfully fitting the visibility curve of @xmath7  ori ( m2 type , @xmath33  k ) with a linear coefficient @xmath34 ( roughly corresponding to a hestroffer law with coefficient  @xmath35@xmath36 ) . beyond this empirical result , it seems non - obvious whether conventional plane - parallel 1d radiative codes such as atlas @xcite or marcs @xcite may be reliably predict the intensity profiles of rsgs .",
    "rsgs are notoriously difficult to model : their atmospheres are very extended , which invalidates the assumption of plane - parallel geometry , and their very cool temperatures require an advanced treatment of molecular opacities .",
    "however more recent codes that assume spherical geometry such as marcs - spherical @xcite , satlas @xcite and phoenix @xcite have demonstrated successful results on comparably cool m  giants or supergiants @xcite .",
    "we used the latest satlas code ( with improved odf treatment and fixed h2o lines ) to weakly constrain the limb - darkening in h  band for both rsgs , with parameters based around the values found in @xcite and @xcite : temperatures ranging from 3100  k to 4000  k ( steps of 100k ) , @xmath37 to @xmath38 and a fixed metallicity @xmath39=-0.5 $ ] @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : ldd ] ( bottom ) presents the results of these simulations as a band of possible brightness distributions .",
    "the intensity profiles are weakly dependent on the temperature and are mostly determined by the mass and surface gravity .",
    "they are characteristics of spherical codes , showing a sudden drop of intensity at the rosseland radius , where the rosseland mean opacity equals unity and where most photons escape the atmosphere .",
    "as shown on figure  [ fig : ldd ] , the brightness distributions can adequately be bounded by two hestroffer laws with coefficients  @xmath40 and  @xmath41 . injecting this prior into the fit",

    "the formation of complex granulations is expected on the surface @xcite , and at the resolution and dynamic contrast provided by interferometry , these appear as compact spots .",
    "here we attempted to search only for the most prominent features , with the assumption that the stellar surface could be described as a limb - darkened disc with a limited number of these spots .",
    "previous studies on @xmath7  ori demonstrated that spots may be modeled well by gaussians or uniform ellipses @xcite .",
    "we also chose to use ellipses , so that each spot is modeled by six parameters : its coordinates on the stellar surface , its size , its flux contribution , its orientation angle and its ellipticity .",
    "our priors on these parameters were flat . during model - fitting , spots were not constrained to be brighter than the stellar surface ( hot ) and thus dark ( cold ) spots were not ruled out .",
    "spots lying on the circumference of the stellar disc were also searched for .",
    "fitting spots is a difficult numerical problem due to the properties of the @xmath32 .",
    "first , while the bispectrum probability density is generally approximated by a convex normal distribution @xcite , this approximation breaks down for small triple amplitudes , e.g. for very resolved targets such as these rsgs .",
    "therefore we revert to use separate @xmath32  expressions for closures and triple amplitudes . the likelihood expression for the closure phases",
    "may then be chosen based @xmath70-wrapped normal distribution @xcite or the von  mises distribution , and in general is non - convex . moreover , because the phase information is only partially retrieved from closure phases , the @xmath32 is multimodal , i.e. there exist local minima into which minimizers can easily get trapped @xcite .",
    "the @xmath32-minimization strategy has then to take both non - convexity and multimodality into account .",
    "due to the relatively large number of parameters ( eight to fourteen : two for the stellar disc description , plus six per spot ) , our strategy consisted in a grid search on the positions of the spots , with a three - step levenberg - marquardt minimization at each given position . during the first step",
    ", only the stellar disc parameters ( diameter and hestroffer coefficient ) and the spot flux are allowed to vary . during the second step , the shape of the spots ( size , aspect ratio , orientation ) is optimized , then in the third step consists all the parameters become free to settle .",
    "figure  [ fig : fits_tper ] and figure  [ fig : fits_rsper ] show that overall the fits provided by our models are not very satisfactory on the short baselines , where our models underestimated the visibilities .",
    "this is due to our naive assumption of a linearly limb - darkened disc model , compared to more refined models ( e.g. satlas , figure  [ fig : ldd ] ) , and possibly to the presence of circumstellar material further obscuring the stellar discs at their edges .",
    "note that model - independent image reconstruction , carried out in section  [ sec : image_reconstruction ] , also shows evidence for strong darkening at the periphery .",
    "however these considerations do not significantly affect our spot analysis , relying on medium and long baseline visibilities .",
    "figure  [ fig : tper_spots ] and figure  [ fig : rsper_spots ] presents the @xmath32 surface as a function of the spot position , as well as the corresponding best one - spot and two - spot models for t  per and rs  per . in all cases , we found that the total flux contribution of the spots represent roughly @xmath71 of the stellar flux .",
    "the reduced @xmath32 and parameters for these models are given in table  [ tab : tper_fits ] and [ tab : rsper_fits ] , with error bars derived using the classic bootstrapping technique .",
    "for t  per , our results imply the presence of a spot on along the diagonal nw - se .",
    "based solely on the @xmath32 metrics , a dark spot in the se quadrant ( @xmath72 ) , or a bright spot on the nw quadrant seem equally probable ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "there is also a slight decrease of @xmath32 ( @xmath74 ) when attempting to fit an additional spot to the dark spot model . for rs  per ,",
    "the results are clearer , with evidence of a single dark spot in the sw . in particular no solution involving any bright spot could be found .      in general",
    "the reduced-@xmath32 metric is ill - adapted to truly assess the relative probabilities of models @xcite .",
    "the @xmath32 decrease that results from the addition of a new set of spot parameters can be due to modeling a real spot or simply to over - fitting , with emergence of artifacts due to imperfect ( _ u , v _ ) coverage . here",
    "we present a general framework to treat the problem of fitting spots , based on bayesian model selection .",
    "model - fitting consists in estimating the most probable model coefficients @xmath75 of a model @xmath76 . to do so we actually maximize the posterior probability @xmath77 : @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the likelihood of the model coefficients",

    "the dominant uncertainties lie in interstellar reddening : though relatively well - characterized , the extinction to the double cluster is considerable due to its distance , and the choice of de - reddening law significantly affect the bolometric magnitude . these temperatures are consistent with previous literature estimates @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : tempscales ] presents our results in relation with four rsg temperature scales from the literature . both scales from @xcite and @xcite",
    "were derived by averaging previous observations from public catalogs , but they most likely suffered from de - reddening issues , underestimating the rsg temperatures .",
    "@xcite used spherical - geometry marcs models ( with the then - new opacity sampling method , later published in @xcite ) and improved de - reddening of the sources , reconciling the observations with both predicted temperatures and evolutionary tracks .",
    "finally , @xcite estimated the temperature by fitting the sed with stellar templates derived from @xcite in place of synthetic models , and independently estimated stellar diameters using the interferometer pti ( palomar tested interferometer ) .",
    "note that the spatial resolution of our chara observations is at least twice that of pti , therefore it should provide more reliable diameter estimates .",
    "our results confirm the hotter temperature scales of rsgs , falling in - between the results of @xcite and @xcite for t  per , and slightly under the levesque s curve for rs  per .",
    "hence , and taking into account the limits of our analysis ( noisy 2007 data compared to current chara / mirc data ) , we are reasonably confident in the quality of our temperature estimates .",

    "the range of possible masses appears to be @xmath148 for t  per , and @xmath149 for rs  per , which translates into @xmath150 for t  per and @xmath151 for rs  per .",
    "these results support the assumptions made during our selection of satlas models in sections  [ sec : ldd ] and  [ sec : temperatures ] .",
    "as four telescope data is secured on both objects , there exists enough phase information in our data sets to attempt `` model - independent image reconstruction '' . here",
    "the prefix `` model - independent '' signifies that the image reconstruction process will not rely on a specific astrophysical model .",
    "the target image @xmath152 is modeled as an array of pixel fluxes  @xmath153 .",
    "as the data is assumed to be normally distributed , to each image we can associate a @xmath154 metric that measure the distance between the observed data ( power spectra and bispectra ) and the same quantities derived from the current image . maximizing the likelihood of the image by minimizing its @xmath32 unfortunately does not lead to reasonable images .",
    "the reason is that image reconstruction belongs to the class of `` ill - posed '' inverse problems : the number of pixels to reconstruct is typically a few thousand , while we only have a few hundreds interferometric data points . under these conditions ,",
    "maximum likelihood leads to an overfitting the data .",
    "it is thus essential to `` regularize '' the solution by introducing reasonable but noncommittal prior expectations about the image .",
    "this is usually done through regularization functions that control the flux distribution within the image .",
    "in addition to preventing over - fitting , good regularizers fulfill other roles .",
    "as underlined during model - fitting , the @xmath32 is heavily multimodal .",
    "most classic regularization function @xmath155 effectively allow to discriminate between these local minima and thus ease minimization of eq .",
    "[ eq : reconst ] . in effect",
    ", regularizers help extrapolate the missing information from the phase lost to the atmosphere and the gaps in the data coverage of the ( _ u , v _ ) plane .",
    "a competent choice of regularizers ensures that high frequencies are extrapolated well , and image reconstruction has demonstrated it achieves super - resolution @xcite , i.e. that the effective resolution of the reconstructed images is typically about three to four times greater than the interferometer resolution .",
    "this regularized maximum likelihood approach constitutes the current framework for image reconstruction in optical interferometry @xcite .",
    "formally , the target image minimizes the sum of the @xmath154 metric and of @xmath156  regularizers @xmath157 : @xmath158 under the constraints of image positivity ( @xmath159 ) and of normalization of the image to unity ( @xmath160 ) .",

    "resolving spots entails that the stellar disc is proportionally much larger , which implies very low visibility amplitudes , and consequently bad signal - to - noise .",
    "moreover , the conventional convex approximations of the @xmath32 expression should then be ruled out . and as exemplified by the difficult reconstruction of vx sgr , the minimization of the non - convex @xmath32 is very prone to appearance of artifacts when using conventional tools such as bsmem  @xcite or mira  @xcite .    to solve this issue",
    "we suggest the use of non - convex reconstruction codes , such as those based on markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) approach . in this paper ,",
    "the software squeeze @xcite was used to obtain the reconstructions presented in this paper .",
    "squeeze uses parallel tempering to tentatively find the global minimum of the criterion in eq .",
    "[ eq : reconst ] , and therefore is well - adapted to non - convex problems .",
    "squeeze is multi - threaded , with each thread conducting minimization by simulated annealing at a different temperature and starting with a different random seed .",
    "compared to its predecessor macim @xcite , it is less sensitive to the initial condition of the markov chains ( i.e. the starting image ) .",
    "thus , the quality of its reconstructions mostly depends on the choice of regularization .    to select the best regularizer",
    ", we generated a synthetic test dataset simulating the observation of a spotted star using the oifits - sim tools @xcite .",
    "the original image used to create the data was chosen as the t  per `` bright spot '' model from figure  [ fig : tper_spots ] , and we use the same ( _ u , v _ ) coverage and signal - to - noise as the actual t  per data .",
    "we then reconstructed the stellar surface using the two most successful regularizers as benchmarked by @xcite : maximum entropy and total variation  @xcite .",
    "maximum entropy was implemented using the multiplicity expression from @xcite , which is well adapted to our mcmc implementation : @xmath162 where @xmath163 is the flux in pixel @xmath164 .",
    "total variation ( hereafter , tv ) is defined as the @xmath165 norm of the spatial gradient @xmath166 : @xmath167 several practical expressions are available to discretize @xmath166 on the image grid . in the context of this paper , we implemented the classic isotropic formulation of @xmath166 , i.e. for each pixel coordinate @xmath168 in the two - dimensional image  @xmath152 , the local gradient was given by : @xmath169 figure  [ fig : reconst_compare ] compares regularization obtained with both these regularizers on our synthetic dataset ( the full reconstruction procedure is detailed in section  [ sec : reconst_proc ] ) .",
    "our results demonstrate that the maximum entropy image suffers from several flaws : the stellar background is excessively non - uniform , and the precise location of spot is lost .",
    "the total variation reconstruction is definitively superior on both aspects .",
    "moreover , and unlike maximum entropy , total variation does not require an additional prior to constrain the flux to stay within a given diameter .",
    "the good performance of total variation are in line with the empirical results of @xcite but also theoretical predictions .",
    "total variation is indeed a direct application of the compressed sensing theory , a recent mathematical framework that supersedes the conventional shannon sampling theorem when applied to sparse images , i.e. , images that may be described with small number of non - zero coefficients in some give basis . here , on first order , our model spotted star consist of a ( mostly ) uniform disc with compact spots or cells .",
    "the spatial gradient of the image is sparse , with only the perimeters of the stellar disc and the spots as non - zero components .",
    "total variation enforces the sparsity of the spatial gradient so that the reconstruction is piecewise constant with sharp transitions , though this is not apparent on figure  [ fig : reconst_compare ] as these images are actually markov chain averages as explained further in section  [ sec : reconst_proc ] .    .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]      to derive a novel regularizer for use on spotted stars , we built upon the idea of spatial gradient sparsity , adding two noncommittal requirements .",
    "the first requirement is that for a given flux to distribute into possible spots , the regularizer should prefer a single spot to two spots , as per occam s razor prescription .",
    "the second requirement is that for a given flux to attribute to a spot , the size of the spot should be determined solely by the data .",
    "this implies that the regularizer value should be independent of the spot size .",
    "it is straightforward to demonstrate that tv violates this second requirement .",
    "let us consider an idealized stellar disc , and two cases : either two small spots of diameter @xmath170 , or a single large spot of diameter @xmath171 .",
    "let us assume the brightness distribution of the disc and the spots as uniform , so that the spatial gradient is null everywhere except on the perimeters of these components .",
    "the actual contribution of the spots to the spatial gradient is then proportional to the spot perimeters  equal to @xmath172 in both cases  multiplied by the flux density for each case . assuming that a combined flux @xmath173 is emitted by the spots , the spot flux density is then @xmath174 for the single spot case , and @xmath175 for the two spot case .",
    "consequently the total variation is @xmath176 for a single spot and @xmath177 for two spots .",
    "while this implies that tv does favor a single spot , this also demonstrates that the regularization depends on the size of the spot , and therefore it may bias a reconstruction toward larger spots .",
    "in contrast the regularizer @xmath178 defined by : @xmath179 meets both our requirements for an ideal regularizer , with @xmath180 and @xmath181 .",
    "figure  [ fig : reconst_compare ] confirms our analysis , and our spot regularizer demonstrates a significant improvement over total variation .",
    "the instrumental resolution is given by the largest chara baseline in our data sets ( s2-w1 or e2-w1 , @xmath182 meters ) , corresponding to  @xmath22 mas in h band .",
    "taking into account a super - resolution factor of four , the effective resolution of the reconstructed images should be about @xmath35  mas . in order to avoid excessive pixellation of the images , the actual resolution of the reconstruction",
    "was set to @xmath183  mas .",
    "we ran five batches of multi - threaded squeeze with @xmath184  threads each , corresponding to a total of @xmath185  independent markov chains that were averaged to reconstruct the final images .",
    "the number of pixel elements in each chain was set to  @xmath186 , with a length of  @xmath187 iterations .",
    "in addition to the spot regularizer derived in the previous section , we made use of the fitting results from section  [ sec : ldd ] to constrain the reconstruction .",
    "the fitted limb - darkening discs were used to initialize the chains to sensible starting points.the factors  @xmath161 were chosen so that the actual reduced @xmath32 is roughly unity for the reconstructed image .",
    "the final reconstructions are presented on figure  [ fig : images ] . for t  per",
    ", the spot location in north west quadrant agrees with the conclusions of bayesian model selection . for rs  per",
    ", there is indeed a darker area in the south west .",
    "however the correct interpretation is unclear : this may be a dark spot , or most of the surface could be understood as a temporary hot convection cell . without data outside the 2007 july / august period",
    ", we can not conclude from this single rs  per image . to exclude the possibility that the surface features on figure  [ fig : images ] are due to ( _ u , v _ ) coverage or to noisy data , we ran an  artifact test \" on both targets .",
    "we generated synthetic observations of the limb - darkening discs derived from model fitting , with exactly the same ( _ u , v _ ) coverage and signal - to - noise as the real data sets .",
    "we then reconstructed the images using the same procedure outlined above , and we found that the reconstructions did not display any significant surface features .    .",

    "we have analyzed the chara / mirc data taken in h  band on two red supergiants t  per and rs  per and presented evidence for the existence of spots on their surfaces .",
    "for this we developed a set of tools dedicated to the analysis of spotted stars . as the utility of simple model - fitting procedures is limited for spotted stars , we demonstrated that bayesian model selection is capable of assessing the relative probabilities of various models , the bayesian evidence constituting a more reliable metric than the reduced @xmath32 .",
    "our results on t  per confirm that hot spots can indeed be observed in @xmath17-band .",
    "if considered together with similar results on @xmath7  ori by @xcite and on vx  sgr by @xcite , it seems we should expect a significant proportion of rsgs to have bright spots , as is thought to be the case for agb stars @xcite .",
    "considering the typical continuum opacity curves in such cool atmospheres @xcite , the continuum opacity should be close to minimum in h  band , where our mirc observations took place .",
    "these spots must be generated very close to the photosphere , and therefore it seems currently doubtful that their enhanced contrast may be explained by opacity effects . as the correct approach to model these objects is not really to model spots , but to interpret the surface in terms of convective cells using 3d models @xcite , inhomogeneous granulation temperatures may explain the spots .",
    "our detection of a  dark spot  on rs  per probably corresponds to a cooler granulation , imaged with the reduced dynamic contrast typical of current interferometry .",
    "we also found that classic regularizers are hardly adequate to reconstruct model - independent images of spotted surfaces .",
    "hence we derived a novel regularizer tailored for this task , based on simple compressed sensing and occam s razor principles .",
    "our reconstructions of t  per and rs  per were found to essentially agree with the bayesian spot selection .",
    "it should be underlined that the data quality from mirc circa 2007 was a major limiting factor in the present analysis .",
    "fortunately since 2007 , the mirc combiner underwent a series of hardware upgrades which drastically improved its performance .",
    "mirc-6 t can now simultaneously combine all six chara telescopes with thrice higher signal - to - noise and much lower systematic errors .",
    "a survey of several rsgs over longer periods of time with mirc-6 t would allow to conclude to whether spots on m  supergiants are ubiquitous , and in particular if a relationship can be found between circumstellar activity / infrared excess and the complexity of observed surface features .",
    "our future work will thus focus on the analysis of new rsg data collected with mirc-6 t , with a systematic application of bayesian model selection to 3d  hydrodynamical models , and the development of better reconstruction algorithms for rsgs .",
