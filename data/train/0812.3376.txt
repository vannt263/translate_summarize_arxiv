    "the study of open charm production in high - energy lepton - hadron and hadron - hadron collisions is considered as a test of the general applicability of perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) and also provides information on the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) of protons and photons .",
    "the present analysis is to explore our potential to access a new dynamical regime , namely the high - energy regge limit , which is characterized by the condition @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the total collision energy in the center - of - mass ( cm ) reference frame , @xmath4 is the asymptotic scale parameter of qcd , and @xmath5 is the typical energy scale of the hard interaction . in the processes of heavy - quark production , one has @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the heavy - quark mass . in this high - energy regime ,",
    "the contribution from partonic subprocesses involving @xmath8-channel parton ( quark or gluon ) exchanges to the production cross section can become dominant .",
    "thus , the transverse momenta of the incoming partons and their off - shell properties can no longer be neglected , and we deal with _",
    "reggeized _ @xmath8-channel partons .",
    "the quasi - multi - regge - kinematics ( qmrk ) approach @xcite is particularly appropriate for this kind of high - energy phenomenology .",
    "it is based on an effective quantum field theory implemented with the non - abelian gauge - invariant action , as suggested a few years ago @xcite .",
    "our previous analyses of charmonium and bottomonium production at the fermilab tevatron @xcite demonstrated the advantages of the high - energy factorization scheme over the collinear parton model as far as the description of experimental data is concerned .",
    "these observations were substantiated for @xmath9-meson production at the tevatron in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the experimental data were again well described using the fadin - lipatov effective reggeon - reggeon - gluon vertex @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the effective photon - reggeon - quark vertex was obtained and for the first time , the hypothesis of quark reggeization was successfully used to describe experimental data on single prompt - photon production and on the proton structure functions @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the cdf collaboration measured the differential cross sections @xmath12 for the inclusive production of @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 mesons in @xmath17 collisions in run  ii at the tevatron as functions of transverse momentum ( @xmath18 ) in the central rapidity ( @xmath19 ) region @xcite .",
    "these measurements were compared with theoretical predictions obtained at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in the collinear parton model of qcd @xcite taking into account quark and hadron mass effects , and it was found that the latter improve the description of the data .    the differential cross sections @xmath12 and @xmath20 for inclusive @xmath21 and @xmath22 photoproduction measured by the h1 @xcite and zeus @xcite collaborations at the desy hera collider were compared with nlo predictions in the collinear parton model . for @xmath21 mesons , this was done in three approaches : the zero - mass variable - flavor - number scheme ( zm - vfns ) @xcite , the fixed - flavor - number scheme ( ffns ) @xcite , and the general - mass variable - flavor - number scheme ( gm - vfns ) @xcite .",
    "the experimental results were found to generally lie above the nlo expectations . for @xmath22 mesons ,",
    "the calculations were performed in the ffns @xcite and in the model suggested by berezhnoy , kiselev , and likhoded @xcite .    in this paper , we study @xmath1-meson production under hera and tevatron experimental conditions as well as the charm structure function @xmath0 of the proton for the first time in the framework of the qmrk approach @xcite complemented with the quark - reggeization hypothesis . this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : two ] , we present the basic formalism of our calculations and briefly recall the qmrk approach in connection with the quark - reggeization hypothesis . in sec .",
    "[ sec : three ] , we consider the charm structure function @xmath0 of the proton and compare our results with experimental data . in secs .",
    "[ sec : four ] and [ sec : five ] , we describe @xmath1-meson production via @xmath23-quark fragmentation at hera and the tevatron , respectively . in sec .",
    "[ sec : six ] , we summarize our conclusions .",
    "in the phenomenology of the strong interactions at high energies , it is necessary to describe the qcd evolution of the pdfs of the colliding particles ( hadrons or photons ) starting from some scale @xmath24 which controls a non - perturbative regime up to the typical scale @xmath5 of the hard - scattering processes , which is typically of the order of the transverse mass @xmath25 of the produced particle ( or hadron jet ) with ( invariant ) mass @xmath26 and transverse momentum @xmath27 . in the region of very high energies , which corresponds to the so - called regge limit , the typical ratio @xmath28 becomes very small , @xmath29 .",
    "this leads to large logarithmic contributions of the type @xmath30^n$ ] , where @xmath31 is the strong - coupling constant , which are conveniently resummed in the balitsky - fadin - kuraev - lipatov @xcite formalism by the evolution of unintegrated gluon and quark distribution functions @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the longitudinal - momentum fraction and transverse momentum of the reggeized parton w.r.t .  the parent particle , respectively .",
    "correspondingly , in the qmrk approach @xcite , the initial - state @xmath8-channel gluons and quarks are considered as reggeons , or reggeized gluons ( @xmath35 ) and quarks ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "they carry finite transverse momenta @xmath34 with respect to the hadron or photon beam from which they stem and are off mass shell .",
    "the advantages of the qmrk approach in comparison with the conventional @xmath37-factorization scheme @xcite include : firstly , it uses gauge - invariant amplitudes and is based on a factorization hypothesis that is proven in the leading logarithmic approximation ; secondly , it carries over to non - leading orders in the strong - coupling constant , as recently proven @xcite .",
    "the reggeization of amplitudes provides the opportunity to efficiently take into account large radiative corrections to processes in the regge limit beyond what is included in the collinear approximation , which is of great practical importance .",
    "recently , the feynman rules for the induced and some important effective vertices of the effective theory based on the non - abelian gauge - invariant action @xcite have been derived in ref .",
    "however , these rules only refer to processes with reggeized gluons in the initial state . as for @xmath8-channel quark - exchange processes ,",
    "such rules are still unknown , so that it is necessary to construct effective vertices involving reggeized quarks using qmrk approach prescriptions in each application from first principles .",
    "of course , a certain set of reggeon - reggeon - particle effective vertices are known , for example for the transitions @xmath38 @xcite , @xmath39 @xcite , and @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "the effective @xmath41 vertex , which describes the production of a quark in the collision of a virtual photon with a reggeized quark , has been recently obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in our numerical calculations below",
    ", we adopt the prescription proposed by kimber , martin , ryskin , and watt @xcite to obtain unintegrated gluon and quark distribution functions for the proton from the conventional integrated ones , as implemented in watt s code @xcite . to obtain the analogous unintegrated functions for the photon , we modify watt s code @xcite . as input for this procedure ,",
    "we use the martin - roberts - stirlin - thorne @xcite proton and the glck - reya - vogt @xcite photon pdfs .",
    "on the experimental side , the charm structure function @xmath0 of the proton was measured by h1 @xcite and zeus @xcite in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) of electrons and positrons on protons at hera . in this section",
    ", we consider this quantity in the framework of the qmrk approach endowed with the quark - reggeization hypothesis .",
    "we thus need the partonic cross section for the production of a @xmath23 quark in the collision of a virtual photon and a reggeized charm quark .",
    "the relevant vertex was found in ref .",
    "@xcite and reads : @xmath42,\\ ] ] where the four - momenta of the virtual photon , the proton , the reggeized charm quark , and the outgoing charm quark are denoted as @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "we concentrate on photons with large virtuality @xmath47 , so that the massless approximation for describing dis structure functions is appropriate @xcite .",
    "we then obtain the following master formula for @xmath0 : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the fractional electric charge of the @xmath23 quark and @xmath50 , with @xmath51 being the bjorken variable .",
    "for definiteness , we choose the factorization scale to be @xmath52 .    in fig .",

    "gev@xmath55 , where our prediction is about @xmath56 below the data .",
    "this disagreement shows the importance of higher - order corrections at large values of @xmath53 , which are beyond the scope of our present study .",
    "on the experimental side , zeus measured the @xmath57 distributions of @xmath21 @xcite and @xmath16 @xcite mesons with rapidity @xmath58 inclusively produced in photoproduction at hera  i , with proton energy @xmath59  gev and lepton energy @xmath60  gev in the laboratory frame , in the ranges @xmath61  gev and @xmath62  gev , respectively . in this section , we compare this data with our qmrk predictions . at leading order ( lo )",

    "[ figdtevn](a)(d ) , our results for @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath21 , and @xmath16 mesons , respectively , are compared with the cdf data @xcite .",
    "we find that the theoretical predictions generally agree rather well with the experimental data , except perhaps for the slope .",
    "in fact , the predictions exhibit a slight tendency to undershoot the data at small values of @xmath57 and to overshoot them at large values of @xmath57 . however , we have to bear in mind that these are just lo predictions , so that there is room for improvement by including higher orders .    in the framework of the collinear parton model , comparisons with the experimental data of ref .",
    "@xcite were performed beyond lo , namely in the fixed - order - next - to - leading - logarithm ( fonll ) scheme @xcite and at nlo in the gm - vfns @xcite .",
    "the fonll predictions systematically undershoot the cdf data @xcite .",
    "the gm - vfns predictions of ref .",
    "@xcite , which are evaluated with ffs determined in the zm - vfns @xcite , describe these data within their errors , but are still somewhat on the low side .",
    "the degree of agreement is further improved @xcite by evaluating the gm - vfns predictions of ref .",
    "@xcite using ffs extracted @xcite from a global fit to @xmath9- and @xmath95-factory data of @xmath96 annihilation in the very same scheme .",
    "in this paper , we explored the usefulness of the quark - reggeization hypothesis in the framework of the qmrk approach by studying several observables of inclusive charm production at lo , namely the charm structure function @xmath0 of the proton measured at hera @xcite as well as the one - particle - inclusive cross sections of @xmath21 and @xmath16 photoproduction in @xmath97 collisions at hera @xcite and of @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath21 , and @xmath16 hadroproduction in @xmath17 collisions at the tevatron @xcite . in all three cases , we found satisfactory agreement between our default predictions and the experimental data , which is quite encouraging in view of the simplicity of our lo expressions for the partonic cross sections .",
    "by contrast , in the collinear parton model of qcd , the inclusion of nlo corrections is necessary to achieve such a degree of agreement .",
    "we thus recover the notion that the qmrk approach is a powerful tool for the theoretical description of qcd processes in the high - energy limit and automatically accommodates an important class of corrections that lie beyond the reach of the collinear parton model at lo @xcite .",
