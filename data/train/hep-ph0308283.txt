    "the discovery of the higgs boson is one of the main goals of searches at the present and next hadronic colliders , the tevatron and the lhc .",
    "the few higgs boson candidates found at the end of lepii @xcite motivate the search for higgs boson production for a higgs mass in the 115 - 120 gev region , specially at the tevatron . since this search will be quite difficult at tevatron , it is important to find different ways to search for higgs bosons .",
    "the lhc is clearly the golden accelerator to look for higgs bosons .",
    "however , the domain at low masses ( @xmath0 gev ) is the most difficult . in that mass domain",
    ", the higgs boson decays mainly into @xmath1 , @xmath2 ( for about 10% of the events ) and into @xmath3 ( for about 0.1% of the events ) . because of the high background in the @xmath1 or @xmath2 channels , only the @xmath3 one seems to be relevant in the standard case and needs quite high luminosity ( about 50 fb@xmath4 to get a 5@xmath5 discovery ) and a precise calibration of the calorimeter .",
    "it is thus important to find other ways of looking for higgs bosons in the 115 - 160 gev mass range , even at the lhc .",
    "the models of diffractive production of jets , leptons , photons or higgs bosons are given in figs .",
    "[ diag1 ] , [ diag2 ] and [ diag3 ] . in fig .",
    "[ diag1 ] and [ diag2 ] , we give the schematic production for the inclusive mechanism . as shown in fig .",
    "[ diag1 ] , the diffractive higgs boson cross section is computed by taking the quark and gluon densities in the pomeron from the h1 experiment at hera @xcite.these densities are then convoluted with the hard subprocess , namely the higgs boson production via a top loop . in the second set of models , see fig .",
    "[ diag2 ] , we take the usual hadron - hadron cross section to produce the hard scattering ( higgs , dijets , @xmath6 ) and convolute it with the normalised parton densities inside the pomeron taken from the h1 experiment @xcite . the third set of models",
    "@xcite called exclusive is completely different since it does not assume the existence of a colorless object in the proton like the pomeron , and gives a perturbative calculation of the diffractive process using the gluon density in the proton ( at the lowest order , the exchange of two gluons is assumed in order to get a colorless object ) .",
    "we will now discuss all these models in more detail , and give their predictions concerning the higgs boson production cross section .",
    "we will also discuss how to test these models using tevatron data .",
    "the factorisable inclusive higgs and dijet production cross sections have been presented in ref . @xcite . in this model , the diffractive gluon density is taken from the h1 measurement @xcite at hera and is used to compute the diffractive dijet , diphoton or higgs boson cross sections , by convoluting this parton density with the standard hard subprocess ( diquark or higgs boson production via a top loop ) .",
    "the cross sections obtained are given in table [ cox ] for the pomeron and reggeon contributions .",
    "we will discuss the assumptions of this model in the following . in this model ,",
    "factorisation breaking between hera and tevatron is assumed to give a factor 0.1 in normalisation for the higgs or dijet production cross sections at the tevatron .",
    "since this number is not known at lhc energies , no factor has been applied for the higgs boson production cross sections at the lhc .",
    "we note that the cross section is very low at the tevatron and quite high at the lhc , provided the survival gap probability is not too small .",
    ".higgs boson production cross section in fb at the tevatron and the lhc for higgs masses between 115 and 160 gev for the _ inclusive factorisable _ models .",
    "the gap survival ( gsp ) probability used in this model is also given .",
    "at the lhc , the gsp is taken to be 1.0 since it is not known and all results should be multiplied by its value ( it should be however less than 0.1 ) ( see ref .",
