    "although lithium is very fragile , its galactic abundance increases from @xmath0(li)(li)= @xmath1 @xmath22.2 at the surface of population ( pop ) ii stars to @xmath0(li)@xmath23.3 or more in pop i. even if lithium is hidden in the atmospheres of pop ii , and its true primordial abundance is @xmath22.7 , a galactic production by @xmath20.7dex is necessary .    the mechanism responsible for lithium production has been proposed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* cameron & fowler ( 1971 ) ) : @xmath3be is produced by fusion of @xmath4he with @xmath5he , and rapidly transported to stellar regions where it can be converted into @xmath3li by k  capture .",
    "notice , then , that the lithium production may last only until there is @xmath4he  available in the region of burning , and that the production ends when the @xmath4he  is all consumed .",
    "there are two main physical situations where this mechanism can produce enough lithium that it is important to investigate their role in the galactic production : the first one is the explosive hydrodynamical formation during the outbursts of novae ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* arnould & norgaard 1975 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* starrfield et al . 1978 ) ) , the second one is the hydrostatic , slow formation in the envelopes of asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars , for which it was first proposed . in envelope models of agb stars ( ( *",
    "* scalo et al . 1975 ) ) , in which the bottom of the convective envelope reaches the hydrogen burning layers , and its temperature ( t@xmath6 ) becomes as large as t@xmath6@xmath240mk , the @xmath4he(@xmath7be chain acts .",
    "these models were able to explain the high lithium abundances found in some luminous red giants , and the process took the name of hot bottom burning ( hbb ) .",
    "in section 2 we will resume the state of the art of the modelling of lithium production during nova outbursts , and in section 3 we will deal with the agb models , to understand whether they can account for the lithium galactic evolution .",
    "in addition , we will show new models of lithium production in super  agb stars ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ventura & dantona 2010 ) ) and speculate on the possible role of these stars as efficient lithium factories .",
    "finally , in section 4 we will shortly summarize the problem of lithium in the  second generation \" stars of globular clusters .",
    "we will not consider here the different , slow mixing process also based on the @xcite mechanism and named",
    " cool bottom burning \" ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* nollett et al . 2003 ) ) .",
    "this process can explain the lithium abundances seen in lower luminosity red giants ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* wasserburg et al . 1995 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sackmann & boothroyd 1999 ) ) , but its physical reasons are not well studied , while the nucleosynthesis in hbb is based on straightforward time ",
    "dependent mixing in standard convective regions .",
    "@xcite was the first to propose that the isotope @xmath4he  could play a role in nova explosion , in the context of a theory of novae powered by thermonuclear detonations .",
    "arnould & noergaard ( 1975 ) proposed that the cameron ",
    "fowler mechanism , acting at the nova outburst , would produce a lithium abundance proportional to the @xmath4he  abundance in the nova envelope .",
    "@xcite showed that the mechanism could be efficient for outburst temperatures @xmath8150mk , and the fast ejection of the @xmath3be rich nova shell leads to @xmath3li production ; they quantified the expected linear relation , between lithium and the @xmath4he  initial mass fraction @xmath9 , as : @xmath10 \\simeq 200 \\times x_{3i}/x_{3\\odot }   \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] where @xmath11  is the solar @xmath4he  mass fraction .",
    "* dantona & matteucci ( 1991 ) ) modelled the galactic evolution of lithium , including the contribution of novae according to this result .",
    "the argument below their modelization was very simple : the nova explosion occurs when a critical hydrogen rich envelope is reached on the white dwarf component of the nova binary , by accretion from its low mass companion . by losing mass ,",
    "low mass stars expose the stellar regions in which the hydrogen burning p ",
    "p chain is incomplete , and thus bring to the surface the @xmath4he  accumulated in the envelope during the period preceding the mass transfer phase , and during the ( slow ) mass transfer phase itself ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* dantona & mazzitelli 1982 ) ) .",
    "thus @xcite linked the lithium abundance produced in the outburst to thedelay time \" between the formation of the white dwarf and the occurrence of nova outbursts . as a result ,",
    "mainly the novae containing an  old \" white dwarf , and therefore an old and @xmath4he  rich low mass companion contribute to the galactic production of lithium , in agreement with the li vs. [ fe / h ] galactic relation .    motivated by the @xcite paper , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* boffin et al . ( 1993 ) ) revisited the influence of @xmath4he  on the nova outbursts with simple one  zone models , but found out that equation [ eq1 ] was a large overestimate , due to two main reasons : 1 ) the neglect of the reaction @xmath12  in the @xcite network , and 2 ) the increasing influence of the competitive reaction @xmath13  when @xmath4he  is enhanced in the nova envelope .",
    "consequently , they found a milder dependence on the lithium production on the @xmath4he : @xmath14 where @xmath15  represents mass fractions , and @xmath16  is the lithium production when the solar @xmath4he  abundance is adopted .",
    "afterwards , @xcite and @xcite re - examined the problem with an implicit hydro - code including a full reaction network , able to treat both the hydrostatic accretion phase and the explosion stage .",
    "they considered both the case of white dwarfs having a carbon  oxygen core and the case of oxygen neon cores , showing that c ",
    "o cores are more efficient in the lithium production , as they have a shorter accretion phase , so that @xmath4he  is not destroyed efficiently , and more @xmath3be is produced .",
    "overproduction of lithium is found , but its dependence on the initial @xmath4he  abundance still follows @xcite prescription . including this revised lithium production in the galactic chemical evolution model , novae appear to be a modest lithium producer ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "are necessary to convert carbon to nitrogen .",

    "their carbon star features may have been lost by cn processing in hbb .",
    "carbon stars in the clouds , in fact , populate only the region at @xmath19@xmath22 .",
    "lithium rich  oxygen rich agb stars embedded in thick circumstellar envelopes have also been discovered in a galactic sample , in a survey by @xcite , aimed at obtaining spectroscopy of very massive agb candidates .",
    "a third possible processing occurs at even larger t@xmath6(@xmath880mk ) , where h burns through the full cno cycle .",

    "consequently , the lithium yield is very dependent on the mass loss rate : larger rates during the phase of lithium production provide a higher lithium yield .",

    "for the super ",
    "agb masses , the average abundance increases , and may also become very large , both due to the stronger production and to the huge mass loss rate achieved by the largest core masses .    based on these first computation of the super  agb phase",
    ", we can make a prediction on the lithium galactic evolution : which are the best producers ?",
    "the larger is the mass , the higher is lithium during the production phase . on the other hand ,",
    "the shorter is the duration of the li rich phase , the smaller is the lithium yield .",
    "increasing the metallicity , t@xmath6  becomes smaller , and the duration of the lithium production phase is longer . for large core mass ( and thus high luminosity ) the mass loss rates become larger and larger .",
    "so we should expect that the li yield is positively correlated both with metallicity and core mass , and that the super  agb stars of metallicity close to solar are possibly great producers .",

    "globular clusters ( gcs ) so far examined show spectroscopic evidence for the presence of two stellar generations : a first generation ( fg ) having  normal \" abundances , similar to those of halo stars of the same metallicity , and a second generation ( sg ) whose abundances are more spreaded , and bear the sign of hot cno processing , with an often very significative oxygen reduction , evidence for the action of the ne  na cycle and sometimes of the mg  al cycle ( see , e.g. ( * ? ? ?",

    "t@xmath6  becomes larger than @xmath280mk , and the on chain of the cno cycle becomes active . in these envelopes , oxygen is cycled to nitrogen , and its abundance can be dramatically reduced .",
    "thus some models for the formation of the different populations attribute the presence of  anomalous \" stars with low oxygen and high sodium , to a sg including matter processed by hbb ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",

    "the lithium yield from agb stars of different mass may contribute to understand the role ( if any ) of these stars in the formation of the sg in gcs .",

    "in fact , if the agb pollutors produce enough lithium , a dilution model must take it into account .",
    "notice that the dilution model is not so straightforward as we may think a priori : it will include a fraction @xmath36  of matter with pristine li , plus a fraction ( 1-@xmath36 ) having the li of the ejecta ( so , either the abundance of the agb ejecta in the agb mass range involved in the sg formation , or zero li for the frms model ) . the dilution required to explain a given range in observed li is different if we assign to the pristine li the value @xmath0(li)=2.72 ( see above ) , or the atmospheric pop ii value ( @xmath22.2 ) , or some intermediate value .",

    "[ f6 ] at face value , ignoring the big question mark on mass loss , the yields can be used to predict the lithium expected in the sg , if the sg is a result of star formation from agb ejecta diluted with pristine gas .",
