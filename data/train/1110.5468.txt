    "we focus on the algorithmic computation of a diagonal form of a given matrix with entries in a euclidean ore algebra @xmath7 .",
    "in contrast to commutative principal ideal domains ( @xmath8 or @xmath6 $ ] for a field @xmath9 ) , there is no such strong normal form as the smith normal form .",

    "the existing proofs of diagonal and jacobson normal forms offer an algorithm directly .",
    "however , such direct algorithms are rarely efficient in general .",
    "we proposed the splitting of the computation of a normal form ( like jacobson form over simple domain ) for matrices over ore localizations into the _ diagonalization _ and the _ normalization _ processes .",
    "the diagonalization process can be formulated and applied in a fairly general setting , while the normalization depends on the algebra and on the properties of concretely given diagonal elements .",
    "both diagonalization and normalization can be performed in a fraction - free fashion , and of course , the same ideas apply to the computation of the smith normal form over a commutative euclidean domain .",
    "as we demonstrate in section [ nfgeneral ] , the question of normal forms over non - simple domains is widely open and distinctly differs from the case where jacobson form exists .    in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the diagonalization and present the fraction - free algorithm [ diagonalpoly ] , which is based on grbner bases , and its implementation in singular : plural @xcite . as a byproduct",
    ", we obtain a fraction - free algorithm for the computation of the smith normal form over a commutative euclidean domain .",

    "we propose a new class of univariate skew polynomial rings , which are obtained as ore localizations of @xmath0-algebras ( olgas , see def .",
    "[ olga ] ) .",
    "this framework is powerful , convenient and constructive at the same time .",
    "notably , it is possible to perform algorithmic computations like grbner bases for modules in such algebras .",
    "moreover , many computations can be done in a fraction - free manner and hence they can be implemented in any computer algebra system , which can handle @xmath0-algebras or general polynomial ore algebras .",
    "such algebras allow to describe time varying systems in systems and control theory @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and constitute a general framework for dealing with linear operator equations with variable coefficients . in @xcite ,",
    "applications of a jacobson form to systems of partial differential equations are shown and several concrete examples are introduced .    in section [ solving ] we discuss solutions to a given system of operator equations with variable coefficients . starting with a polynomial ring @xmath10 and its big localization @xmath2 ,",
    "we denote by @xmath1 the presentation matrix @xmath10-module , corresponding to the system of equations .",
    "we compute matrices @xmath3 and a diagonal matrix @xmath4 , such that @xmath5 .",
    "then , we determine a smaller localization @xmath11 of @xmath10 , over which both @xmath3 become invertible .",
    "we provide a module isomorphism for @xmath12-modules , which allows to treat more general solutions , than those one can obtain with the @xmath2-module structure .    in prop .",
    "[ cyclicalg ] we propose an algorithm for a probabilistic computation of a jacobson form via a cyclic vector .",

    "+    [ polyisbetter ] using the fraction - free strategy , two improvements can be observed .",
    "on the one hand , once we have mapped the matrix we work with from @xmath124 to @xmath125 , the complicated arithmetics in the skew field of fractions is not used anymore .",
    "the other improvement lies in the nature of the construction of normal forms for matrices and the corresponding transformation matrices",
    ". the naive approach would be to apply elementary operations inclusive division by invertibles on the rows and columns , that is , operations from the left and from the right .",
    "indeed , there are methods using different techniques like , for instance , @xmath126-adic arguments to calculate the invariant factors of the smith form over @xmath8 @xcite , but this method does not help in constructing transformation matrices . surely the swap from left to right has no influence in the commutative framework . but already in the rational weyl algebra @xmath127 , @xmath128 is an unit in @xmath127 and @xmath129 . comparing the multiplication by the inverse element ,",
    "that is , with @xmath130 , we see that @xmath131 holds .",
    "thus a multiplication of any polynomial containing @xmath60 with the element @xmath128 in the field of fractions causes an immediate coefficient swell . since a normal form of a matrix",
    "is given modulo unimodular operations , the previous example illustrates the variations of possible representations . in examples , which we gather in the subsection [ examplez ]",
    ", the fraction - free strategy leads to a moderate increase of coefficients .",
    "on the other hand , switching to the polynomial framework changes the setup .",
    "the algebra @xmath10 is not a principal ideal domain anymore , which was the essential property for the existence of a diagonal form over @xmath2 . in the sequel ,",
    "we show how that this problem can be resolved by introducing a suitable sorting condition for the chosen module ordering .",

    "a block denotes all elements of the same leading position in @xmath97 . in theorem [ polynomialbasis ]",
    "we show that these elements indeed generate @xmath133 , while in lemma [ mindeg ] we show that these elements provide us with additional information .",

    "in particular , our algorithm returns transformation matrices with reasonable sizes of their entries and their coefficients .    concerning the further development of our implementation in singular @xcite called ` jacobson.lib ` , we plan the following enhancements . in order to provide diagonal form computations over @xmath319-algebras like @xmath319-commutative , @xmath319-shift , @xmath319-difference and @xmath319-weyl algebras",
    ", we need to find involutive antiautomorphisms .",
    "it turns out , that there are no @xmath576-linear but @xmath9-linear involutions , which act on @xmath319 as a non - identical involutive automorphism of @xmath576 .",
    "we will work on finding such involutions and adapt the implementation to the more general situation .",
    "moreover , it is possible to employ modular grbner bases in the implementation .",
    "we have demonstrated , how working with a ring @xmath10 and its localization @xmath556 with respect to some ore set @xmath577 is used in various situations . in this paper we concentrated on rings of polynomials respectively",
    "rational functions .",
    "the same ideas in theory immediately apply to operator algebras @xmath578\\langle \\d \\rangle$ ] and @xmath579 .",
    "however , in practical computations with the computer we are restricted to finite power series , presented by a laurent polynomial .    for the weyl and @xmath319-weyl algebras over a field",
    "@xmath9 with @xmath580 , algorithmic computations are possible over the local ring @xmath6_{\\mathfrak{m}_p}$ ] for @xmath581 and @xmath582 .",
    "notably , the ore completion of the set @xmath6\\setminus\\{\\mathfrak{m}_p\\}$ ] over shift and @xmath319-shift algebras will contain zero .",
    "thus , there is no analogon to the situation with ( @xmath319)-weyl algebras .",
    "* 1*. from the description and the proof of the algorithm [ diagonalpoly ] , we need in principle only the existence of a terminating grbner basis algorithm over @xmath2 resp . @xmath10 .",
    "the latter relies on the constructivity of basic operations with fractions in @xmath2 via @xmath10 .",
    "thus the algorithm [ diagonalpoly ] immediately extends to the case of a general olga @xmath583 ( cf .",
    "[ olga ] ) for a nontrivial completely prime ideal @xmath43 by @xcite .",
    "in which bigger class of algebras one can perform concrete computations ?",
    "one can work with local rings like @xmath6_{\\mathfrak{m}_p}$ ] , @xmath581 and @xmath584 $ ] for @xmath580 or with @xmath585 for @xmath586 as coefficient domains .",
    "* 2*. the algorithm computes @xmath230 such that @xmath5 .",
    "it is clear , that @xmath3 are not unique . by fixing @xmath1 and @xmath4 , how can one describe the set @xmath587 ?",
    "does there exist @xmath588 resp .",
    "@xmath551 from this set , such that special properties like unimodularity hold ?",
    "this is connected , in particular , to the recent results of a.  quadrat and t.  cluseau @xcite .",
    "namely , they prove the existence of matrices @xmath198 and @xmath232 , which are unimodular over @xmath10 for certain situations and present an algorithm for the computation of these matrices .",
    "* 3*. one of the most important problems in non - commutative computer algebra is to show algorithmically , that two given finitely presented modules are not isomorphic .",
    "it is still open even for cyclic modules over general simple euclidean ore domain .",
    "namely , let @xmath2 be the latter domain and @xmath589 with @xmath590 . up to now",
    "there is no algorithm , which determines that @xmath591 .",
    "however , there are several situations , where this question has been solved . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors presented a semi - algorithm for finitely presented modules .",
    "given degree bounds for the variables , the algorithm first looks for matrices , determining a homomorphism .",
    "if such a pair has been found , the kernel and cokernel of the corresponding homomorphism are computed and returned .",
    "as we have seen , over non - simple domains we have many different normal forms . starting with classical operator algebras like the ( @xmath319-)shift algebra and @xmath319-weyl algebra",
    ", it is important to describe possible normal forms .    * 5*. as in the previous item , what is the most probable normal form for a random square matrix ( which is then of full rank ) over a non - simple domain ?",
    "though it seems that this might depend on the algebra , we conjecture the @xmath592 , that is a jacobson form , is the most probable one .",
    "such approach might lead to the classification as in * 4*.",
    "we express our gratitude to eva zerz and hans schnemann for discussions and their advice on numerous aspects of the problems , treated in this article .",
