    "silicon monoxide ( sio ) is a widely observed astronomical species and appears to be ubiquitous in our galaxy . since its initial detection by @xcite",
    ", sio has proved to be a key astrophysical maser and its very bright maser emissions are the subject of continued study @xcite .",
    "sio was originally detected in the interstellar medium by @xcite .",
    "its emissions were subsequently observed in the envelopes of oxygen - rich giant and super - giant stars @xcite and the remnants of supernova 1987a @xcite .",
    "sio was detected in absorption in cool giant stars @xcite including @xmath6 tau @xcite .",
    "sio absorptions are prominent in sunspots which have proved to be a fruitful source of spectroscopic data on highly excited states @xcite which we exploit below",
    ". furthermore recent detections of hot , dense exoplanets have led to the speculation that their atmospheres might contain significant quantities of sio from vaporised silicates @xcite .",
    "these astronomical applications , combined with technological uses of sio spectra @xcite , have motivated a number of laboratory studies .",
    "@xcite,@xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite have all produced molecular constants characterising sio vibration - rotation states .",
    "transition probabibilities or einstein - a coefficients have also been provided by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "transition line lists have been constructed using these data @xcite , but none of them appears to be particularly complete .",
    "for example no single line list combines a comprehensive set of transition frequencies with an accurate model for the transition intensities .",
    "it is this that we aim to do here .",
    "@xcite reported transition probabilities for a large number of transitions based on a semi - empirical dipole moment which they claim should give results accurate to about 10  % .",
    "@xcite computed an accurate electric dipole moment function for the sio molecule which not only reproduces accurate dipole moments , but also reproduces line strengths for vibrational - rotational transitions within the ground - state manifold .",
    "the resulting line lists are for @xmath0si@xmath1o , @xmath2si@xmath1o and @xmath3si@xmath1o for @xmath7 but @xmath8 is limited to 15 .",
    "intensities were calculated using band intensities and hnl - london factors .",
    "@xcite calculated an _ ab initio _  @xmath0si@xmath1o line list for @xmath9 and @xmath10",
    "although the publically available line list from the strasbourg data centre contains only 503 transitions .",
    "@xcite s intensities are significantly larger than those of @xcite and they estimate their intensities are only accurate to about 20  % .",
    "the exomol project @xcite aims to provide line lists of spectroscopic transitions for key molecular species which are likely to be important in the atmospheres of extrasolar planets and cool stars ; it aims , scope and methodology have been summarised by @xcite .",
    "line lists for @xmath11 xh molecules , x = be , mg , ca , have already been published @xcite . in the present paper ,",
    "we present rotation - vibration transition lists and associated spectra for the five major isotopologues of sio .",
    "these line lists are particulary comprehensive and should be valid for temperatures up to 9000 k.",
    "rotation - vibration line lists for the ground electronic state of sio were obtained by direct solution of the nuclear motion schrdinger equation using the program level8.0 @xcite . in principle",
    "the calculations were initiated using a potential energy curve ( pec ) calculated _ ab initio_. in practice , as detailed below , there are sufficient experimental data available for sio that the pec was actually characterised by fitting to these data using the program dpotfit 1.1 @xcite .",
    "there appears to be no experimental measurements of any sio transition dipoles and a single measurement of its permanent dipole moment as a function of the vibrational state by @xcite .",
    "we determined a new dipole moment curve ( dmc ) using high level _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    "these are compared to previous , high - level _ ab initio _",
    "determinations @xcite given below .",
    "the _ ab initio _",
    "calculations were performed using molpro @xcite ; we tested both the coupled cluster ( ccsd(t ) ) and multi - reference configuration interaction ( mrci ) methods with large basis sets .",
    "our largest , and best , calculations used an aug - cc - pcv5z basis set for the ccsd(t ) study and aug - cc - pwcv5z for mrci ; in both cases a correction due to the correlation of the core electrons was included but the corresponding correction due to relativistic effects was found to be very small and was neglected .",
    "these calculations give a value for the dipole at equilibrium of 3.10 d and 3.07 d , respectively , which bracket the experimentally determined value of 3.088 d @xcite .",
    "the _ ab initio _",
    "dmc grid points were used directly in level .",
    "figure  [ fig : dipole ] compares the dmc s arising from our calculations with those obtained by @xcite ( cck ) using an mrci method .",
    "other previous studies based on the use of similar ccsd(t ) method gave curves similar to our ccsd(t ) calculation .",
    "the ccsd(t ) dipoles appear correct at short bondlengths but behave in an unphysical fashion for @xmath12   .",
    "ccsd(t ) is known to have problems as molecules are dissociated and so this model was not pursued . again at short @xmath13 our mrci dipoles are similar to those of cck .",
    "it is unclear why cck s dipoles do not vary smoothly as @xmath13 is increased but such behaviour is not consistent with obtaining reliable transition intensities .",
    "all calculations presented below therefore use our mrci dipole moments .",

    "the observed stellar spectrum would require running a stellar model which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "however it clear that both the line positions and general band structure predicted by our calculations are in very good agreement with the observations .",
