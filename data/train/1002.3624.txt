    "since the first realization of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) in 1995 @xcite , the focus of experiments with coherent atomic samples has shifted from the investigation of fundamental properties of becs towards the application of these properties to probing a variety of physical processes .",
    "bose - einstein condensates have been extensively used to simulate lattice effects in solid state physics @xcite , to investigate dipolar quantum gases @xcite and to show anderson localization of matter waves @xcite , to mention only a few . regarding atom interferometry @xcite ,",
    "however , the most remarkable results have been so far achieved using thermal atoms , e. g. for the measurement of the gravitational constant @xmath0 @xcite , the fine structure constant @xmath1 @xcite and for the definition of time in atomic clocks @xcite .",
    "bose - einstein condensates and the coherent beams or pulses derived from them , known as atom lasers , offer a compelling alternative to thermal sources .",
    "atom lasers like the @xmath2rb device used in this experiment are narrow - linewidth , highly directed beams , and their narrow transverse velocity widths make them favorable for high momentum transfer beam splitting in atom interferometers , effectively allowing larger enclosed areas and higher sensitivities to , e.g. , accelerations and rotations",
    ". the internal atomic states of the freely propagating atom laser used in this experiment ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) are magnetically insensitive to first order .",
    "similar to atoms in an atomic clock , the atom laser is strongly decoupled from its environment and well isolated from external sources of noise .",
    "improving the applicability of becs and atom lasers to the field of atom interferometry will involve either increasing the average atomic flux or improving the interferometric sensitivity by implementing quantum mechanical reduced - uncertainty ( so - called squeezed ) states @xcite , allowing a decrease in detection noise below what is known as the quantum projection noise limit @xcite . squeezing of atomic samples has become a subject of increasing importance in recent years .",
    "_ @xcite have demonstrated spin squeezing in trapped bose - condensed samples , and groups in copenhagen and cambridge have observed spin squeezing on the atomic clock transition in @xmath6cs @xcite and @xmath2rb @xcite .",
    "atom lasers , coherent atomic beams output - coupled from a bose - einstein condensate , offer a promising choice to implement a variety of squeezing mechanisms @xcite . a necessary prerequisite for implementing and observing spin - squeezing in an atomic sample is a highly stable interferometry and detection setup . more precisely , one needs to operate at the quantum projection noise limit .    in this paper",
    ", we present quantum projection noise limited operation of our atom laser ramsey type interferometer @xcite .",
    "we use a novel optical setup based on a sagnac interferometer to achieve highly passively stable two - photon raman coupling between the internal atomic states involved in the interferometer .",

    "we measure the probability @xmath8 of transferring atoms between two internal states , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , using a freely propagating pulse of coherent atoms . in the case of equal atom numbers ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) , fluctuations in the absolute number @xmath13 do not contribute to the classically achievable minimum uncertainty in @xmath14 .",
    "the limit is determined by quantum projection noise , @xmath15 .",

    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ scheme ] , we describe the experimental scheme , in particular the inherently stable optical sagnac interferometer used to produce raman light and the atomic shot noise limited imaging system . section [ results ] contains the results of our ramsey interferometry experiment and a noise analysis in the context of the quantum projection noise limit .",

    "the reduction of noise to an absolute minimum is the critical point that every part of the experimental setup is focussed on . in the following ,",
    "we describe the scheme for producing raman light to couple two internal states of the freely propagating atom laser .",

    "the two - photon rabi frequency @xmath39 is suppressed due to destructive interference of the different terms contributing to @xmath39 .",
    "this suppression is based on the same mechanism that prevents raman transitions to be driven with a purely phase - modulated light field . in the case of even values of @xmath53 ( @xmath55 ) ,",
    "the situation is different , and the electric field at the output port of the sagnac interferometer is suitable for driving raman transitions in the atomic sample .",
    "its amplitude modulation is no longer suppressed by the destructive interference effect described above .    to verify these points , we measure the beat note amplitude on the light at the output of the sagnac interferometer for various modulation depths at a modulation frequency of @xmath42ghz and values of @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( fig .",

    "a useful feature of our setup for generating the appropriate light field is that both the output intensity and the beat note amplitude after the sagnac interferometer have a well defined dependency on the modulation depth of the phase modulator . for a given output intensity",
    ", we can therefore infer the beat note amplitude on the light field .",
    "this relation of output intensity and beat note amplitude is independent of the modulation frequency . in other words , simultaneously measuring the intensity output and the beat note amplitude after the sagnac interferometer allows us to calibrate the beat note amplitude , and thus @xmath39 , with respect to the intensity .",
    "as the calibration is independent of the modulation frequency of the eom , it can be carried out at any arbitrary frequency within the bandwidth of the eom .",
    "once such a calibration curve has been established , one can infer the beat note amplitude from a simple intensity measurement of the light field . for high microwave frequencies ,",

    "<S> every measurement of the population in an uncorrelated ensemble of two - level systems is limited by what is known as the quantum projection noise limit . here , we present quantum projection noise limited performance of a ramsey type interferometer using freely propagating coherent atoms . the experimental setup is based on an electro - optic modulator in an inherently stable sagnac interferometer , optically coupling the two interfering atomic states via a two - photon raman transition . </S>",
    "<S> going beyond the quantum projection noise limit requires the use of reduced quantum uncertainty ( squeezed ) states . </S>",
    "<S> the experiment described demonstrates atom interferometry at the fundamental noise level and allows the observation of possible squeezing effects in an atom laser , potentially leading to improved sensitivity in atom interferometers . </S>"
