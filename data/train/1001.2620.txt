    "communication constraints play a major role in consensus and related problems of distributed computation and control .",
    "such constraints can be represented by a graph of available communication links among agents , together with further restrictions on which information can be exchanged across links .",
    "recently , the constraint of quantization , that is of communication restricted to a discrete set of symbols , has received significant attention .",
    "although most works to - date have dealt with discrete - time dynamics , it is worth considering the same restrictions in the context of continuous - time dynamics , because the dynamics of the agents is naturally described by continuous - time systems in many applications .",
    "an example of this is robotic networks .",
    "one might argue that it is possible to study the effect of quantization on continuous - time systems by considering their discretized or sampled - data model .",
    "however , implementing consensus control algorithms by discretizing the dynamics requires implicitly that all the agents sample synchronously with the same clock , a requirement which is difficult to satisfy in practice .",
    "this lack of synchronicity may disrupt the convergence properties of the algorithm and thus asks for a different approach .",
    "this paper proposes an approach which deals with consensus problems in continuous - time without relying on sampled - data systems : consensus is achieved by quantized measurements which are transmitted asynchronously .",
    "indeed , the quantization of the states induces a partition of the space into regions and each agent transmits quantized information about its state only when the state crosses the boundary of the quantization regions . in this sense communication among the agents takes place asynchronously . throughout the paper",
    "no assumption is imposed on the resolution of the quantizers , which therefore can be also very coarse .",
    "hence , this paper specifically aims at giving a rigorous treatment of continuous - time average consensus dynamics with uniform quantization in communications .",
    "it is an established fact that consensus problems can be reformulated in terms of feedback control systems : as expected , when quantization enters the loop , the stabilization problem becomes more challenging . from a mathematical point of view",
    ", a consequence of quantization is that we obtain a system with a discontinuous righthand side , which is not guaranteed to admit solutions in classical sense .",
    "this paper proves that classical or carathodory  solutions may in fact not exist : considering solutions in some generalized sense is thus unavoidable .",
    "the literature provides different approaches to the technical problem of having systems with discontinuous righthand sides ( see  @xcite for a review of these topics ) .",
    "tools from the theory of discontinuous differential equations and nonsmooth analysis have already been applied in consensus problems in @xcite . here",
    "we focus on krasowskii solutions essentially for two reasons : effectiveness and generality . with regard to effectiveness , there are many results available concerning the existence and continuation of krasowskii solutions , as well as a complete lyapunov theory @xcite . with respect to generality ,",
    "since the set of krasowskii solutions includes filippov and carathodory  solutions , results about krasowskii solutions also hold for filippov and carathodory  solutions , provided that they exist . on the other hand",
    ", the set of krasowskii solutions may be too large .",
    "in particular , from a practical point of view it may contain sliding modes which induce chattering phenomena . in the context of quantized consensus , chattering amounts to fast information transmission between the agents .",
    "this is undesirable because it results in algorithms which require large bandwidth communication channels to be implemented . to cope with this issue",
    ", we propose the use of a quantizer endowed with a hysteretic mechanism , and study the resulting dynamics by a hybrid system approach .",
    "specifically , we provide an estimate of the data rate needed to implement the quantized continuous - time consensus algorithm .",
    "these results can be of interest to other application fields , including load balancing problems and real - time control systems .",
    "with respect to earlier literature , our contribution is twofold . on one hand",
    ", we give a mathematical treatment , in terms of differential equations with discontinuous righthand sides , of a continuous - time consensus system under uniformly quantized communication of the states .",
    "we do this when the communication graph is only weakly connected and weight balanced . after showing basic properties of solutions , such as existence , boundedness and average preservation , we prove convergence to a set containing the equilibria of the system .",
    "this set depends on the communication graph , and is reduced to the set of equilibria in the particular case of symmetric graphs . on the other hand , our paper is the first to propose the application of hysteretic quantizers to solve a consensus problem with data rate constraints .",
    "preliminarly , we prove that the system is well - posed , in the sense that a solution exists , is forward unique , and the set of switching times is locally finite .",
    "the main results consist in proving convergence and estimating the required data rate .    in our paper , we provide convergence results for both the krasowskii and the hysteretic dynamics discussed above . due to the constraint of static uniform quantization",
    "we can not obtain exact consensus , but we can obtain approximations of the consensus condition which we informally refer to as `` practical consensus '' .",
    "similar conditions have been obtained elsewhere in the literature , which has already considered some related problems of quantized consensus .",
    "a number of publications have discussed mostly in discrete - time systems several options to deal with the quantization constraint , namely uniform deterministic quantizers  @xcite , uniform randomized quantizers  @xcite , logarithmic quantizers  @xcite , and adaptive quantizers  @xcite .",
    "moreover , quantization has been considered also in _ gossip _ consensus algorithms  @xcite . regarding continuous - time systems ,",
    "relevant bibliography includes  @xcite , which discusses discontinuous differential equations with consensus applications , and  @xcite , which studies a rendezvous algorithm in which each agent tracks another agent assigned to it by a quantized control law .",
    "a recent paper ( @xcite ) is also related : using graph - theoretical tools , the authors study a quantized consensus problem , under the assumption that the communication graph is a tree .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : problem ] we recall definitions and results from graph theory and about average consensus dynamics without quantization , recalling how the consensus problem can be reformulated in terms of a stability problem",
    ". we also present the problem of quantization in a continuous - time setting . in section  [ sec : unifquant ]",
    "we introduce state quantization and krasowskii solutions and we study the fundamental properties of the system : we compute the set of equilibria , we prove average preservation , and we deduce asymptotic and finite - time convergence results .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : hysteresisquant ] we define and study the system under a hysteretic quantizer , in terms of a hybrid system . after proving that chattering can not occur",
    ", we study the fundamental properties of this system : equilibria , average preservation and convergence .",
