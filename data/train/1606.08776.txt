    "we have chosen units such that @xmath19 for ease of notation , and called @xmath20 the energy gap between the two logical states of the qubit , @xmath21 the frequency of the @xmath22 oscillator in the bath , and @xmath23 its coupling strength to the qubit . in eq .",

    "all relevant bath properties are contained in the spectral density @xcite @xmath24 whose explicit form depends on the type of system and environment being considered . in circuit quantum electrodynamics , information about @xmath25 can be obtained by inspecting either the effective damping or noise caused by an electronic circuit coupled to a superconducting qubit @xcite . in light - absorbing biomolecules , such as chromophores",

    "the form of eq .",

    "a conventional assumption is that @xmath25 has a power - law behavior for small frequencies and vanishes in the limit @xmath27 in order to avoid pathological phenomena @xcite .",
    "thus , for this study , we use the spectral densities @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the dimensionless effective coupling strength .",
    "the differences between @xmath30 and @xmath31 are solely due to the choices of the cutoff function .",
    "while the heaviside distribution @xmath32 determines a sharp cutoff for @xmath33 , the exponential function establishes a smooth cutoff for @xmath34 .",

    ", such a condition occurs for @xmath65 it is also worth keeping in mind that the approximation to instantaneous error - free @xmath53 pulses is theoretically convenient since the hamiltonian of a single pulse is usually much stronger than the unperturbed system hamiltonian .    a natural question to ask is how random time jitter would influence the optimized decoherence suppression achieved by iudd as the number of pulses increases .",

    "one guarantees that all errors , caused by some external source , are uncorrelated and independent of the total elapsed time @xmath58 .",
    "furthermore , using a gaussian distribution is a sensible choice given that the complete characterization of errors might not be straightforward in the laboratory or even theoretically .",
    "other error models to the amplitude and phase of @xmath53 pulses have already been explored @xcite .",
    "however , the present paper explicitly considers a microscopic model for the system - bath arrangement and addresses the optimized sequences described by eq .   rather than periodic and concatenated sequences .",
    "for our analysis , besides studying @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the average signal produced by pudd after a large number of realizations , subjected to gaussian fluctuations , we found it convenient to also define and study the quantity @xmath75 clearly , good experimental implementations of udd would require values of @xmath76 close to one because @xmath77 as @xmath78 , which corresponds to iudd . in the next sections , we compare numerical results for qubit decoherence suppression produced by iudd and pudd in the configurations mentioned earlier .",
    "first , we carry out our analysis with a spectral density of the form described in eq .  .",

    "one may think of @xmath73 as an indicator of tolerance or threshold for errors in units of memory ( qubit ) .",
    "this is similar to what is normally done for quantum gates @xcite .",
    "provided that errors are mainly introduced by random jitter , both threshold and protection time @xmath58 will play a fundamental role on the interpretation of the results presented here . according to fig .",
    "[ fg : pudd1 ] , for a threshold set at @xmath96 and the dimensionless protection time @xmath97 , one has that @xmath98 pulses are already enough to keep the coherence of the qubit .",
    "however , for smaller thresholds , let us say @xmath99 and again @xmath97 , the application of three pulses is not useful for @xmath6 , and the application of a large number of pulses , e.g. , @xmath100 , is even worse in the sense that just @xmath9 stays below the threshold . in other words , unlike iudd , where a large number of pulses is always advantageous , this may not be true for pudd .",
    "the reason is that each pulse contributes to errors in @xmath74 so that the application of more pulses causes larger deviations from the ideal signal .",
    "it is important to remark that fig .",
    "[ fg : pudd1 ] reveals that devising a qubit interaction with a super - ohmic bath is desirable for a power - law spectral density with a sharp cutoff , so that it can reduce the impacts of random timing jitter and produce better decoherence suppression as long as relatively few pulses are applied .",

    "the comparison between @xmath73 and @xmath76 for different numbers of pulses and @xmath2 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : pudd1b ] .",
    "the main point to notice is that the behavior of @xmath73 with respect to @xmath2 is opposite from the one observed in fig .",
    "[ fg : pudd1 ] , so that the presence of a super - ohmic bath makes the qubit more affected by decoherence and udd sequences less robust against timing errors .",
    "the fact that the peaks of @xmath33 and @xmath34 are respectively at @xmath101 and @xmath102 plays an important role here . for @xmath33 , the integration in eq",
    ".   stops at @xmath101 and therefore the values of @xmath103 have larger contributions to @xmath63 . on the other hand , the integration in eq .",
    "does not have an upper bound for @xmath34 , which means that the values of @xmath5 contribute more to the deviation of the signal since the peak of the spectrum is beyond @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , the area under @xmath34 becomes considerably larger than the area under @xmath33 for super - ohmic environments , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : arjpl ] .",

    "in this section , we discuss case ( ii ) , where a qubit is coupled exclusively to a single damped harmonic oscillator @xmath107 with frequency @xmath10 .",
    "the damping experienced by the oscillator arises due to its interaction with a bath .",
    "this system is a paradigmatic model to represent the transfer of electrons between two localized sites in a biomolecule @xcite , as well as a qubit interaction with a prominent harmonic mode of a cavity field or vibration of a nano / microcantilever @xcite .",
    "this complicated problem can be effectively converted to the simple spin - boson problem treated in configuration ( i ) , where now the qubit is only subjected to an effective bosonic bath .",

    "the starting point is to consider an ohmic spectral density for a bath in contact with the single harmonic oscillator @xmath107 .",
    "this can be conveniently written as @xmath108 , with a cutoff frequency @xmath1 .",
    "then , with the use of normal coordinates for the bath , and the assumption of a broad continuum ( @xmath109 ) , it is possible to make configuration ( ii ) assume the form of configuration ( i ) , but with an effective spectral density @xmath12 that reads @xcite @xmath110 where @xmath111 and @xmath112 , with @xmath113 being the mass of the single harmonic oscillator @xmath107 . of course",

    ".   behaves ohmically at low frequencies and goes to zero in the opposite limit . also , contrary to the power - law case , it has a peak and this is both size and width dependent on @xmath114 . in underdamped cases ( @xmath115 ) , @xmath116 is narrow in the sense of a delta function and presents a peak around @xmath117 .",
    "the greater values of @xmath114 comprising the critical damping ( @xmath118 ) and overdamped cases ( @xmath119 ) make @xmath116 broader with a peak that does not coincide with @xmath117 .",

    "with @xmath116 to investigate the effects of coherence preservation under iudd and random timing jitter under pudd for configuration ( ii ) .",
    "the important point here is that the qubit is again under pure dephasing , now caused by its interaction with a structured environment .",
