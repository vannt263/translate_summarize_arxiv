    "a constraint satisfaction problem ( csp ) consists of @xmath0 variables , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 clauses , i.e. @xmath3-valued functions , @xmath4 .",
    "an assignment @xmath5 is a solution if all clauses simultaneously evaluate to @xmath6 . in the context of wireless networks , we show that csps provide a unifying framework that encompasses many important resource allocation tasks .",
    "examples include : allocation of radio channels so that transmissions by neighbouring wlans ( wireless local area networks ) or mobile phone cells do not interfere ; the selection of packets to be xored on each link in network coding ; and finding a non - colliding schedule of time - slots in a wlan .",
    "unlike in traditional csps , however , in network applications each constrained variable @xmath7 is typically co - located with a physically distinct device such as an access point , base - station or a link .",
    "the resulting communication constraints impose severe restrictions on the nature of the algorithm that can be used for solving the csp .",
    "these restrictions are violated by existing csp solvers , leading us to define a new class of algorithms that we term _ decentralized csp solvers_. we constructively establish the existence of decentralized solvers by introducing a family of randomized algorithms belonging to this class .",
    "roughly speaking , decentralized csp solvers must be capable of finding a satisfying assignment , @xmath5 , while updating each variable @xmath7 based solely on knowledge of whether all of the clauses in which @xmath7 participates are satisfied or at least one clause is unsatisfied .",
    "the following example gives a concrete illustration of the origins of these constraints .",
    "802.11 wlans are ubiquitous , but their deployments are unstructured and they operate in an unlicensed frequency band . within this band ,",
    "an 802.11 wlan can select one of several channels , typically @xmath8 , to operate on . in the vast majority of wifi routers",
    "channel selection is , at present , based on operator selection without any quantitative instruction from the router .",
    "self - selection of this channel is the task we consider here .",
    "co - ordinated selection is hampered by the fact that the interference range of a typical 802.11 device is substantially larger than its communication range .",
    "consequently , wlans can interfere but may be unable to decode each others messages ( illustrated schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : example ] ) .",
    "discovery by a wlan of the existence of interfering wlans via its wired back - haul may be prevented by firewalls and , in any case , these wlans may not know their physical location .",
    "these practical restrictions mandate a decentralized channel - selection algorithm",
    ".    we can identify the task of each wlan self - selecting a non - interfering channel with a csp with communication constraints imposed by the network topology .",
    "let @xmath7 be the channel selected by wlan @xmath9 and define @xmath10 clauses , one for each pair of wlans , that evaluates to one if the wlans are on non - interfering channels or are out of interference range and is zero otherwise .",
    "due to the unstructured nature of the deployment , the lack of shared administrative control and communication constraints , a wlan can not rely on knowing the number or the identity of interfering wlans or the channels that they currently have selected . a practical csp solver for this task can only rely on each wlan being able to measure whether : ( i ) all of the neighbouring wlans have selected a different channel from it ; or ( ii ) if one or more neighbours have selected the same channel .        in certain settings ,",
    "a limited amount of communication of variable values between the stations hosting them may be feasible .",
    "for example , it may be possible for stations hosting a link or for a wlan to overhear beacons or traffic from a subset of its interferers , or for an access point to communicate with other , nearby access points .",
    "algorithms for channel selection that are proposed in the literature assume the existence of end - to - end communication for centralized solutions , for message passing in decentralized or gossiping solutions , or to co - ordinate global restart in simulated annealing proposals e.g. @xcite and references therein .",
    "this information , however , tends to be opportunistic in nature and can not be relied on _ a priori_. we leave how best to exploit such partial information to future work , focusing here on the most challenging , fundamental cases where fully decentralized algorithms are required .",
    "the primary contributions of this paper are fourfold .",
    "firstly , we show that csps provide a unifying framework that encompasses several important problems in wireless networks , including channel selection , inter - session network coding and decentralized scheduling in a wlan .",
    "each of these problems is generally thought of as being distinct and requiring different solution approaches .",
    "we show that they are fundamentally related as csps so that the decentralized csp solver introduced in this paper can be used for all of them .",
    "secondly , we define a new class of csp algorithms which we term decentralized csp solvers and , extending our earlier approach to graph colouring @xcite@xcite , introduce a novel stochastic decentralized csp solver proving that it will find a solution in almost surely finite time , should one exist , and showing it has many practically desirable properties .",
    "thirdly , we benchmark the algorithm s performance on a well - studied class of application - agnostic csps , random k - sat . for problems with up to a thousand variables , which are large for our motivating examples , we find that the time the algorithm takes to find a satisfying assignment is close to that of walksat @xcite , a well regarded , efficient centralized csp solver , while also possessing desirable features of survey propagation @xcite . that is , despite its decentralized nature , the algorithm is fast .",
    "fourthly , we demonstrate the solver s practical utility in a complex , wireless resource allocation case study .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ subsec : dcsps ]",
    "we define decentralized csp solvers and show that well - known algorithms for solving csps fail to meet these criteria . in section [ sec : cfl ] we introduce a decentralized csp solver . we prove that it finds a solution in finite time with probability one whenever a feasible solution exists , obtaining an upper bound on the algorithm s convergence rate in the process . in section [ sec : sim ] we consider its speed at identifying solutions of instances of random k - sat . in section [ sec",
    ": example ] we demonstrate the algorithm s utility in solving the problems that motivated its introduction",
    ". section [ sec : disc ] contains discussion and closing remarks .",
    "we begin by formalizing the criteria that csp solvers must possess to be of use for problems with communication constraints such as those outlined above .",
    "we call algorithms that meet these criteria decentralized csp solvers .",
    "a csp with @xmath0 variables , @xmath11 , and @xmath2 clauses is defined as follows .",
    "the variables each take values in a finite set @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "each clause @xmath14 is defined by a function @xmath15 where for an assignment of variables , @xmath5 , @xmath16 if clause @xmath17 is satisfied and @xmath18 if clause @xmath17 is not satisfied .",
    "an assignment @xmath5 is a solution to the csp if all clauses are simultaneously satisfied .",
    "that is , @xmath19    this encompasses all of our examples of interest as well as k - sat , the most well - studied general class of csps .",
    "a csp solver is an algorithm that can find a satisfying variable assignment for any solvable csp .",
    "a csp solver takes a csp as input and determines a sequence @xmath20 such that for any csp that has satisfying assignments :    : :    for all @xmath21 sufficiently large @xmath22    for some satisfying assignment @xmath5 ; : :    if @xmath23 is the first entry in the sequence    @xmath20 such that @xmath24 is a    satisfying assignment , then @xmath25 for all    @xmath26 .    to provide criteria that classify csp solvers as being decentralized , we begin with the following definition .",
    "we say that variable @xmath7 participates in clause @xmath27 if the value of @xmath7 can influence the clause s satisfaction for at least one assignment of the rest of the variables in @xmath5 .    for each variable @xmath7 ,",
    "let @xmath28 denote the set of clauses in which it participates : @xmath29    re - writing the left hand side of eq . in a way that focuses on the satisfaction of each variable we have : @xmath30 a decentralized csp algorithm can be thought of as having intelligence co - located with each variable .",
    "the intelligence at variable @xmath7 can only determine whether all of the clauses that @xmath7 participates in are satisfied or that at least one clause is unsatisfied and must make update decisions locally based solely on this knowledge .",
    "a decentralized csp solver is a csp solver that for each variable @xmath7 , @xmath9 , must select its next value based only on an evaluation of @xmath31 that is , for each variable @xmath7 the solver must make a decision on the next value of @xmath7 based solely on knowing whether that variable is currently satisfied or not without explicitly knowing :    : :    the assignments of other variables , @xmath32 for any    @xmath33 ; : :    the set of clauses that any variable , including itself , participates    in , @xmath34 for @xmath35 ; : :    the functions that define clauses , @xmath36 for    @xmath37 .",
    "note that the properties of any csp solver mean that a decentralized csp solver must , without explicit communication , settle upon a satisfying assignment the first time one is found .",
    "communication to co - ordinate global stopping or restarting of the solver would be contrary to the nature of the natural constraints of these problems and so is forbidden .",
    "the stochastic algorithm we define in section [ sec : cfl ] shall provably satisfy the properties of a decentralized csp solver with probability one .",
    "moreover , it will also have the desirable property that it will automatically restart its search , without communication , upon any change to the clauses of a csp that makes the current variable assignment no longer satisfying .",
    "this is significant in practical applications as , for example , the arrival of new transmitters in a wireless network would induce a change the associated csp .      before proceeding ,",
    "we demonstrate that several important resource allocation tasks in wireless networks fall within this csp framework , which , therefore , provides a unifying framework for analyzing these tasks .",
    "_ 1 ) graph colouring .",
    "_ as briefly described in section [ sec : channel_all ] , the channel assignment problem corresponds to decentralized graph colouring . in the simplest model",
    ", the network is described by an undirected interference graph @xmath38 with vertices @xmath39 and edges @xmath40 .",
    "each vertex represents a wlan and an edge exists between two wlans if they interfere with each other when on the same channel .",
    "define @xmath41 and @xmath42 and let @xmath43 denote the set of available colours ( channels ) and let @xmath7 be a variable with value equal to the colour selected by an intelligence co - located with each vertex @xmath44 .",
    "each clause @xmath45 , which is an enumeration of the elements of @xmath40 , can be identified with an edge @xmath46 .",
    "we define @xmath47 the participation set , @xmath28 , of a variable @xmath7 consists of all clauses where the vertex @xmath48 is one end of the associated edge , @xmath49 a variable assignment satisfies this csp if and only if it is also a proper colouring for the graph @xmath50 .",
    "proper colourings correspond to channel assignments in which no two neighbouring wlans in the interference graph have selected the same channel . to find a proper colouring , when one exists , a decentralized csp solver requires only that an intelligence co - located with each vertex @xmath48 can measure whether : ( i ) all of its neighbours are using a different colour from vertex @xmath48 ; or ( ii ) at least one neighbour has selected the same colour as vertex @xmath48 .",
    "this information is sufficient to evaluate eq . and",
    ", in particular , the intelligence at each vertex does not need to know : the colour selected by any other vertex ; its set of neighbours ; or the exact nature of the clauses @xmath36 , @xmath37 .",
    "_ 2 ) channel assignment with channel - dependent interference . _ whether or not transmitters interfere in the channel assignment task may depend on the radio channel selected .",
    "this can arise due to frequency dependent radio propagation or to channel dependent spectral masks .",
    "that is , for regulatory reasons , different spectral masks are typically used when transmitting on channels at the edge and on channels in the middle of a radio band .",
    "this problem then has a collection of conflict graphs , one for each possible radio channel .",
    "this version of the channel assignment task can also be formulated as a csp even though it is no longer a graph colouring problem .",
    "let @xmath51 , @xmath52 be a set of undirected graphs with the same vertices @xmath39 but possibly differing edge sets @xmath53 .",
    "again each vertex represents a wlan , but the interference graph is channel - dependent . the graph @xmath54 is associated with radio channel @xmath55 and an edge exists in @xmath53 if two wlans interfere while on channel @xmath55 .",
    "let @xmath7 be a variable with value equal to the channel selected by each vertex @xmath44 .",
    "each clause @xmath56 , which is an enumeration of all edges in all graphs , can be identified with a @xmath52 and an edge @xmath57 and is defined by @xmath58 the collection of clauses that variable @xmath7 , associated with vertex @xmath48 , participates in can be identified as @xmath59 with @xmath7 being the current channel selection of vertex @xmath48 , for all @xmath60 the clauses associated with @xmath61 are automatically satisfied .",
    "thus to evaluate eq .",
    "it is sufficient for the station to measure if no neighbour coincides with its current channel selection or if at least one does . to find an interference - free channel assignment",
    ", a decentralized csp solver requires that each vertex @xmath48 can measure whether : ( i ) all of its neighbours on the currently selected channel are using a different channel from itself ; or ( ii ) at least one neighbour has selected the same channel .",
    "_ 3 ) inter - session network coding .",
    "_ network coding has been the subject of considerable interest in recent years as it offers the potential for significant increases in network capacity @xcite . in network coding ,",
    "network elements combine packets together before transmission rather than forwarding them unmodified",
    ". the combined packets can be from individual flows , known as intra - flow coding , or across multiple flows , inter - flow coding .",
    "while intra - flow coding within multicast flows has been well studied , inter - flow coding between unicast flows has received less attention , yet is , perhaps , of more immediate relevance to current internet traffic .",
    "inter - flow coding is known to be challenging @xcite .",
    "the task of a network finding a feasible linear network code in a distributed fashion , but with some global sharing of calculations , is investigated in @xcite through the use of a genetic algorithm . this task can be formulated as a csp .",
    "let @xmath38 denote a directed acyclic multi - graph representing the network with vertices @xmath39 and edges @xmath40 .",
    "each vertex represents either a source of an information flow , a destination or router in the network .",
    "edges represent physical connections between these elements .",
    "time is slotted and each edge can transmit a single packet per slot .",
    "we allow multiple edges between vertex pairs in order to accommodate higher rate links .",
    "it is the goal of each link beyond the source to determine a linear combination of its incoming packets to forward so that ultimately all flows get to their destinations .",
    "as the combination of packets coded by each link will take care of routing , each flow @xmath62 is defined by its source , @xmath63 , and its destination @xmath64 .",
    "each flow is assumed to be unit rate with higher rate flows accommodated by flows with the same source and destination vertices .",
    "we will treat the collection of source , @xmath65 , and destination vertices , @xmath66 , as special , solely having one incoming and one outgoing edge per flow respectively .",
    "for each edge @xmath67 , define @xmath68 , @xmath69 , to be its source vertex and @xmath70 , @xmath71 , to be its target vertex . for each vertex",
    "@xmath72 we define the set of incoming edges @xmath73 and the set of outgoing edges @xmath74 . for each edge",
    "not corresponding to source , @xmath75 , we associate a variable @xmath76 , which is an enumeration of the power set of the set of flows @xmath77 .",
    "we define a bijective map @xmath78 that determines a vector whose positive entries correspond to flows to be coded .    in total",
    ", we have @xmath79 clauses .",
    "one for every link that is nt an outgoing link from a source vertex . at each time slot , each link that does nt correspond to a source or final destination link , @xmath80 , wishes to forward a packet consisting of xored packets ( corresponding to addition in the galois field of two elements ) from the flows indicated by @xmath81 .",
    "each final link @xmath82 wishes to forward packets from @xmath83 , which we indicate by the vector @xmath84 with a @xmath6 at the location @xmath83 and zeros elsewhere .",
    "a link and its immediate upstream neighbouring links will be dissatisfied if it can not do so .",
    "more formally , for each edge not corresponding to the outgoing link from a source or incoming link to a destination , @xmath85 , we have a clause @xmath86 , @xmath27 , defined by @xmath87 where @xmath88 is a binary vector and @xmath89 is the rectangular matrix consisting of @xmath90 for @xmath91 and and @xmath92 if @xmath93 for some @xmath83 .    to complete the csp , we need to ensure that packets from flow @xmath83 can be decoded at their destination @xmath94 .",
    "for @xmath95 , then with @xmath96 we introduce a clause @xmath97 where again @xmath88 is a binary vector and @xmath98 is is the rectangular matrix defined above .",
    "the set of clauses a link variable @xmath7 , @xmath99 , participates in is @xmath100 any variable assignment then satisfies this csp if and only if it is a realizable network code satisfying all flow demands .    hence , to find a proper assignment a decentralized csp solver requires only that each link @xmath48 can determine whether : ( i ) its own coding is realizable and the coding of its immediately down - stream links are realizable ; or ( ii ) if at least one of these is not realizable . this is sufficient to evaluate eq . .",
    "each link does not need to explicitly know : the code selected by any other link ; the network topology ; any details of how code realizability is determined at any link .",
    "_ 4 ) decentralized transmission scheduling .",
    "_ in an ethernet or wlan it is necessary to schedule transmissions by stations .",
    "this might be achieved in a centralized manner using tdma , but it can also be formulated as a decentralized problem .",
    "the classical csma / ca approach to decentralized scheduling never settles to a single schedule and some comes at a cost of the possibility of continual collisions .",
    "recently , there has been interest in decentralized approaches for finding collision - free schedules , see @xcite .",
    "this task can be formulated as a csp as follows .",
    "let @xmath39 denote the set of transmitters in the wlan , @xmath101 denote the set of available time slots and define @xmath41 and @xmath10 .",
    "let @xmath7 be a variable with value equal to the transmission slot selected by transmitter @xmath44 .",
    "define a clause @xmath27 associated with each pair of transmitters @xmath102 such that @xmath103 the participation sets are @xmath104 any variable assignment satisfies this csp if and only if it is also a collision - free time - slot schedule . to find a collision - free schedule ,",
    "when one exists , a decentralized csp solver requires only that each transmitter @xmath48 can measure whether : ( i ) all of its neighbours are using a different time - slot from transmitter @xmath48 ; or ( ii ) at least one transmitter in the wlan has selected the same time - slot as transmitter @xmath48 .",
    "again , this is all that is needed to evaluate eq . .",
    "each transmitter does not need to know : the time - slot selected by any other transmitter ; the set of transmitters ; the clauses .",
    "the literature on general purpose csp solvers is vast , typically focusing on solving k - sat problems in conjunctive normal form , but they can be broadly classified into those based on : ( i ) the davis - putnam - logemann - loveland ( dpll ) algorithm @xcite ; ( ii ) survey propagation @xcite ; and ( iii ) on stochastic local search ( sls ) @xcite .",
    "each of these approaches has experienced substantial development and has its own merits , but none were motivated by problems where variables have a geographical sense of locality .",
    "algorithms developed from the dpll approach have proved to be the quickest at sat - race and sat competition in recent years , e.g. manysat @xcite .",
    "the dpll approach ultimately guarantees a complete search of the solution space and so meets the and criteria .",
    "they are , however , based on a branching rule methodology , e.g. @xcite , that assumes the existence of a centralized intelligence that employs a backtracking search .",
    "the implicit assumptions of the information available to this intelligence breaks the conditions and so they are not decentralized csp solvers .    survey propagation , a development of belief propagation @xcite from trees to general graphs , has proved effective in graphs that do not contain small loops @xcite . for a given csp , the fundamental structure of study is a called a factor graph . in order to generate this ,",
    "it is necessary to know what clauses each variable participates in and the nature of each of the clauses , breaking the and criteria and so these are not decentralized csp solvers .",
    "sls algorithms also depend fundamentally upon the exchange of information , mostly in an explicit manner breaking the condition by basing update decisions on relative rankings of the constraint variables but also in a more subtle fashion . to see this implicit requirement , consider the following algorithm for binary valued variables originally proposed by papadimitriou @xcite and developed further by schning @xcite .",
    "pick a random assignment of values for the constraint variables . repeat the following : from all of the unsatisfied clauses , pick one uniformly at random ,",
    "select one of the variables participating in that clause and negate its value , breaking the and conditions .",
    "the algorithm halts when all clauses are satisfied or a specified time limit expires .",
    "although simple , this forms the basic building block for all sls algorithms , including the well - studied walksat algorithm @xcite .",
    "it is important that a single unsatisfied clause is selected at each step and that a single variable within the clause is adjusted as it is this that leads to the algorithm behaving as a random walk @xcite .",
    "thus , again , solvers in this class are not decentralized .",
    "we now introduce an algorithm that satisfies the decentralized csp solver criteria .",
    "an instance of the following communication - free learning ( cfl ) algorithm is run in parallel for every variable . for each variable , @xmath105 it keeps a probability distribution , @xmath106 over @xmath107 as well as the current variable value @xmath7 . in pseudocode ,",
    "the cfl algorithm is :    initialize @xmath108 , @xmath109 .",
    "realize a random variable , selecting @xmath110 with probability @xmath106 .",
    "evaluate @xmath111 , returning _",
    "satisfied _ if its value is @xmath6 , as this indicates all of variable @xmath48 s clauses are satisfied given the present assignment , and _",
    "unsatisfied _ otherwise .",
    "update : if _ satisfied _ , @xmath112 if _ unsatisfied _ , @xmath113 where @xmath114 $ ] are design parameters .    to understand the logic behind cfl , note that for each variable a probability distribution over all possible variable - values is kept .",
    "the variable s value is then selected from this distribution . should all the clauses that the variable participates in be satisfied with its current value , the associated probability distribution is updated to ensure that the variable value remains unchanged .",
    "if at least one clause is unsatisfied , then the probability distribution evolves by interpolating between it and a distribution that is uniform on all values apart from on the one that is presently generating dissatisfaction .",
    "thus if all of a variable s clauses were once satisfied , the algorithm retains memory of this into the future .",
    "this has the effect that if a collection of variables are content , they can be resistant , but not impervious , to propagation of dissatisfaction from other variables .",
    "cfl possesses two parameters .",
    "the parameter @xmath115 determines how quickly the past is forgotten , while @xmath116 determines the algorithm s aversion to a variable value should it be found to cause dissatisfaction . even though an instance of cfl is run for each variable",
    ", we shall show that this completely decentralized solution is a csp solver .",
    "from here on we will assume that the update step 5 is performed in a synchronized fashion across variables .",
    "without synchronization , the fundamental character of the algorithm does nt change , but the analysis becomes more involved .",
    "synchronization solely requires that algorithm instances each have access to a shared sense of time and that this can be achieved without information - sharing or other communication between variables , i.e. between algorithm instances .",
    "a suitable clock is , for example , available to any internet connected device via the network time protocol ( ntp ) .      by construction ,",
    "the only information used by the algorithm is @xmath117 in step 4 and thus it satisfies the criteria , and .",
    "that is , it only needs to know if all clauses in which variable @xmath48 participates are satisfied or if one or more are not .",
    "the cfl algorithm also satisfies the criterion that it sticks with a solution from the first time one is found . to see this , note that the affect of step 5 is that if a variable experiences success in all clauses that it participates in it continues to select the same value with probability @xmath6 .",
    "thus if all variables are simultaneously satisfied in all clauses , i.e. if @xmath118 , then the same assignment will be reselected indefinitely with probability @xmath6 .    to establish that the cfl algorithm is a decentralized csp solver all that remains is to show that it meets the criterion , that if the problem has a solution it will be found , which is dealt with by the the following theorem .",
    "it provides an upper bound on the distribution of the number of iterations the algorithm requires to find a solution to any solvable csp .",
    "it s proof exploits the iterated function system structure of the algorithm and can be found in the appendix .",
    "[ thm : main ] for any satisfiable csp , with probability greater than @xmath119 the number of iterations for the cfl algorithm to find a satisfying assignment is less than @xmath120 for a csp corresponding to graph coloring , a tighter bound holds and a satisfying assignment will be found with probability greater than @xmath121 in a number of iterations less than @xmath122    theorem [ thm : main ] proves that for fixed @xmath0 the tail of the distribution of the number of iterations until the first identification of a satisfying assignment is bounded above by a geometric distribution and so all of its moments are finite . as theorem [ thm : main ]",
    "covers any arbitrary csp that admits a solution , for any given instance these bounds are likely to be loose .",
    "they do , however , allow us to conclude the following corollary proving that if a solution exists , the cfl algorithm will almost surely find it .    for any csp that admits a satisfying assignment , the cfl algorithm will find a satisfying assignment in almost surely finite time .",
    "hence the cfl algorithm satisfies all of the criteria , almost surely , and so is a decentralized csp solver .",
    "theorem [ thm : main ] establishes that the cfl algorithm provably identifies satisfying assignments for all values of its two design parameters , @xmath116 and @xmath115 .",
    "the value of @xmath116 determines the algorithm s aversion to variable values for which clause failure has been experienced . the value of @xmath115 impacts on the speed of convergence of the algorithm .",
    "optimal values of @xmath116 and @xmath115 depend upon each problem and a performance metric .",
    "for fast convergence across a broad range of csps with distinct structure , we have found that small values of @xmath116 and @xmath115 , corresponding to strong aversion to a dissatisfying variable value and reasonably long memory , work well .",
    "thus for simplicity , we set @xmath123 in all experimental examples .",
    "we use @xmath124 for random 3-sat , @xmath125 for random 4-sat and @xmath126 for random 5-sat .",
    "we use @xmath125 for our wireless networks example , a value which we have found to yield good performance across a range of @xmath127-sat problems .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     a csp associated with a specific networking task will possess structure induced by its topology . before considering practically - motivated applications in section [ sec : example ] , as the cfl algorithm can solve any csp but its design was subject to restrictions not normally considered it is prudent to investigate its performance as a csp solver in an application - agnostic setting .",
    "we present simulation data evaluating the performance of the cfl algorithm for random k - sat , a well - studied class of csps .",
    "a k - sat problem is a csp in which all variables are binary - valued and clauses consist solely of logical disjunctions of no more than k variables . in random k - sat , an instance of k - sat is generated by drawing @xmath2 such clauses uniformly at random @xcite .",
    "our investigation surprisingly reveals that the cfl algorithm is competitive with centralized and distributed solvers on problems of reasonable size ( order 1000 variables ) .",
    "briefly , we first review current knowledge regarding random k - sat .",
    "the behavior of random k - sat is known to depend strongly on the parameter @xmath128 with phase transitions and associated thresholds @xmath129 and @xmath130 . if @xmath131 the constraint problem is unsatisfiable with high probability , while if @xmath132 a satisfying assignments exist with high probability .",
    "evidently , @xmath133 and it is conjectured that @xmath134 @xcite .",
    "a simple argument gives @xmath135 and this upper bound can be refined to obtain the values in the second row of table [ table ] .",
    "also shown in row four of this table are estimated values for @xmath129 derived from statistical physics considerations .",
    "these latter estimates are supported by experimental data for @xmath136 , e.g. @xcite , although there are fewer experimental studies for @xmath137 .",
    "it can be seen that the theoretical bound for @xmath129 and the estimated values are in good agreement for @xmath138 , and that both approach @xmath139 for large @xmath127 .",

    "this linearity holds even when @xmath149 is close to @xmath130 ( data is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ksatvsn ] for 3-sat with @xmath155 ) and is of great practical importance as it implies that with high probability the cfl algorithm finds a satisfying assignment in polynomial time .    comparing the performance of the cfl algorithm with the popular walksat algorithm",

    "time is similar for cfl and walksat . above this value , however , the stopping time for walksat diverges , increasing super - exponentially in @xmath149 .",

    "having established general properties of cfl and determined its performance on random instances of k - sat , we return to a problem of the sort that motivated its introduction .",
    "we consider the performance of the cfl algorithm in a realistic wireless network case study . from the online database wigle",
    "@xcite we obtained the locations of wifi wireless access points ( aps ) in an approximately @xmath157 area at the junction of 5th avenue and 59th street in manhattan .",
    "this space contains @xmath158 aps utilizing the ieee 802.11 wireless standard .",
    "it can be seen from figure [ fig : meandistance ] , which plots the mean number of aps lying within distance @xmath159 of an ap , that within a 15 m radius an ap has on average 3 neighbours and within a 30 m radius it has on average 10 neighbours .",
    "of the 11 channels available in the 802.11 protocol , only 3 are orthogonal .",
    "thus managing interference in this dense deployment is a challenging task .",
    "imagine a worst - case scenario where after a power - outage all these aps are switched back on .",
    "the aim of each ap is to select its radio channel in such a way as to ensure that it is sufficiently different from nearby wlans .",
    "this can be written as a csp where we have @xmath160 aps and @xmath0 variables @xmath7 corresponding to the channel of ap @xmath48 , @xmath161 .",
    "as per the 802.11 standard @xcite and fcc regulations , each ap can select from one of 11 radio channels in the 2.4ghz band and so the @xmath7 , @xmath162 take values in @xmath163 . to avoid excessive interference",
    "each ap requires that : ( a ) no other ap within a 5 m distance operates closer than 3 channels away ; ( b ) no ap within a 10 m distance operates closer than 2 channels away and ( c ) no ap with a 30 m distance operates on the same channel",

    "taking the radio path loss with distance as @xmath176 , where @xmath159 is distance in meters and @xmath177 the path loss exponent , then these constraints ensure @xmath178 db attenuation between aps .    assuming all aps use the maximum transmit power of 18dbm allowed by the 802.11 standard",
    ", this means that the sinr is greater than 20db within a 10 m radius of each ap which is sufficient to sustain a data rate of 54mbps when the connection is line of sight and channel noise is gaussian @xcite .",
    "observe that each variable @xmath7 is located at a different ap .",
    "the aps do not belong to a single administrative domain and so security measures such as firewalls prevent communication over the wired network .",
    "an ap can not rely on decoding wireless transmissions to communicate with all of its interferers or even just to identify them .",
    "this is because interferers may be too far away to allow their transmissions to be decoded and yet still their aggregate transmission power may be sufficiently powerful to create significant interference .",
    "that is , an ap can not know the channel selections of other aps , condition and , moreover , can not reliably identify or enumerate the clauses in which it participates , condition .",

    "[ fig:5thave ] shows an example satisfying assignment of radio channels obtained by running an instance of the cfl algorithm at all aps .",

    "[ fig:5thavedist ] shows the measured distribution of number of iterations required to find a satisfying assignment , whereupon the algorithm natural halts in a decentralized fashion .",
    "the median value is 21 iterations and the 95% centile is 98 iterations .",
    "note that during this convergence period , although the network is operating sub - optimally , it does not cease to function . in a prototype lab set - up",
    "we have shown that a cfl update interval of less than 10 seconds is feasible on current hardware .",
    "thus the median time to convergence is under 4 minutes .",
    "this is a reasonable time - frame for practical purposes , particularly as subparts of the network are functioning during this convergence period , and thus the cfl algorithm offers a pragmatic solution to this difficult decentralized csp for which existing solvers could not be employed .",
    "we have shown that apparently distinct problems in networking can be placed within the framework of csps , where - unlike with traditional motivating examples - the variables are co - located with devices that may not be able to communicate .",
    "we define the criteria that practical solvers must possess in order to be suitable for theses problems , labeling them decentralized csp solvers .",
    "as existing solvers fail to meet one or more of these criteria , we introduce a decentralized algorithm for solving csps .",
    "we prove that it will almost surely find a satisfying solution if one exists . in doing so",

    "we suspect , however , that our bounds for a general csp are not tight and conjecture that the real bound should be closer to the one we have for the specific case of csps corresponding to graph coloring .    given how much information decentralization is sacrificing , surprisingly an experimental investigation of solving random k - sat instances suggests that the algorithm is competitive with two of the most promising centralized k - sat solvers , walksat and survey propagation , on instances of",
    "random k - sat with order one thousand variables .",
    "this raises the question : what is the performance cost of decentralized operation ?",
    "this is particularly pertinent as the decentralized nature of the cfl algorithm lends itself to parallelized computation as it has a small , fixed memory requirement per variable , making it suitable for use in circumstances where a centralized algorithm could also be used but would be difficult to implement in a distributed fashion .",
