    "it is widely accepted that the disk instability model ( dim ) provides the correct description of dwarf nova outbursts ( e.g bath & pringle 1982 , smak 1984 , lin , papaloizou & faulkner 1985 , cannizzo 1993a ) and probably of soft x - ray transient events ( van paradijs & verbunt 1984 , mineshige & wheeler 1989 , cannizzo 1998a ) . in this model , the variability of a steadily fed thin accretion disc is due to the occurrence of a thermal - viscous instability in the disc . for a certain range of mass transfer rates from the secondary , @xmath3 ,",
    "the effective temperature of a disc annulus lies within the unstable range @xmath4 k , which corresponds to hydrogen recombination inside the disc .",
    "the unstable annulus then experiences a limit cycle during which matter is processed at rates larger or smaller than the mean rate @xmath3 ( see cannizzo 1993b or osaki 1996 for reviews ) .",
    "transition fronts are essential to the dim because they are the link between the local instability of an annulus and the global evolution of the disc .",
    "the time required by a heating front to cross the disc is related ( depending on wavelength ) to the rise time of an outburst .",
    "similarly , the time required for a cooling front to cross the disc defines the decay time of an outburst in the dim ( if the entire disc is brought to the hot state , the decay time is increased by a `` viscous plateau '' phase , see cannizzo 1993a ) .",
    "observations of the rise , decay and recurrence times therefore allow a direct test of the predictions of the dim .",
    "several attempts to determine the structure and properties of transition fronts exist in the literature .",
    "analytical studies lead only to qualitative results or to complex results that require numerical simulations for calibration ( meyer 1984 , lin et al .",
    "1985 , vishniac & wheeler 1996 , vishniac 1997 ) .",
    "on the other hand , numerical studies have difficulties in correctly handling transition fronts because the fronts are very narrow and their propagation involves time and length scales which vary by several orders of magnitude in a single outburst . as discussed by hameury et al .",
    "( 1998 , hereafter hmdlh ) , heating fronts are unresolved in most numerical simulations while cooling fronts are often barely resolved , in particular close to the disc inner edge ( see e.g. cannizzo , chen & livio 1995 ) .",
    "the poor resolution of transition fronts not only affects localized regions of the disc but it has also consequences for the global evolution of the disc ( cannizzo 1993a , hmdlh ) .",
    "hmdlh have recently developed an implicit time - dependent numerical code which solves the disc equations on an adaptive grid .",
    "the code allows the resolution of very narrow structures in the disc at a relatively low computational cost .",
    "here we use this code to study the detailed structure and the propagation velocities of heating and cooling fronts .",
    "we show that the width of any transition front is proportional to the disc pressure scale height @xmath5 , and not to @xmath6 as proposed by cannizzo et al . .",
    "we confirm the existence of a self - similar regime of the hot inner disc during the propagation of a cooling front , and we discuss the possible reflections of cooling ( resp .",
    "heating ) fronts into heating ( resp .",
    "cooling ) fronts .",
    "the time evolution of an accretion disc is driven by thermal - viscous processes . for a keplerian disc the viscous equation , describing mass and angular momentum conservation ,",

    "the viscosity is parameterized according to @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the sound speed in the disc midplane , @xmath5 is the vertical scale height of the disc and the parameter @xmath2 ( @xmath13 ) describes our ignorance of the viscous processes .",
    "shakura and sunyaev ( 1973 ) first proposed this prescription with @xmath2 constant , but it was later shown by smak ( 1984 ) that @xmath2 must be larger for the hot ionized disc than for the cold neutral disc in order to obtain large amplitude outbursts in the dim .    in the following , we use two parameterizations often adopted in the literature .",
    "first , we adopt an @xmath14 prescription and an arbitrary functional dependence of @xmath2 with the disc central temperature @xmath15 which is similar to that used in hmdlh , i.e. @xmath16 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times \\left[1 + \\left ( \\frac{2.5 \\times 10 ^ 4 \\ ; \\rm k}{t_{\\rm c } } \\right)^8 \\right]^{-1 } , \\label{eq : alpha}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the two constant values of @xmath2 on the hot and the cold stable branches of the thermal equilibrium curves ( or s - curves ) , respectively .",
    "the second parameterization we consider is @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a constant ( @xmath21 here ) .",
    "such a dependence has been strongly advocated by several authors to explain the observed exponential decays of soft x - ray transients @xcite .",
    "this interpretation may face some difficulties , however (  4.6 ) .",
    "note that the viscosity parameter @xmath22 in this case ( e.g. mineshige & wheeler 1989 ) .",
    "the importance of allowing the disc outer edge , @xmath23 , to vary with time in order to reproduce correct outburst cycles was emphasized by hmdlh and before by smak ( 1984 ) and ichikawa and osaki ( 1992 ) .",
    "transition fronts are , however , localized structures and should not be influenced by the physical conditions at the disc outer edge .",
    "this is confirmed by a comparison between models differing only in whether or not @xmath23 varies with time , which shows that the structure and the properties of the fronts are identical in the two classes of models ( except when a front reaches @xmath23 ) . in the following , we assume that @xmath23 is fixed",

    "( [ eq : heat ] ) are no longer negligible .",
    "we use the numerical code developed by hmdlh with 800 grid points .",
    "this corresponds to about 100 points in the transition fronts , and is more than sufficient to avoid resolution - limited results .",

    "when the thermal - viscous instability is triggered at a given ignition radius , two heating fronts appear which propagate in opposite directions in the disc . because the ignition radius is often close to one of the disc edges , one of the two fronts is actually short - lived ( i.e. quickly reaches the disc edge ) .",

    ".    a careful look at figure  3 of hmdlh reveals a sudden increase and then decrease of the inner accretion rate , @xmath88 , which precedes the bulk of accretion in inside - out outbursts ; this spike is very short lived , contains almost no energy , and is probably not observable .",

    "this accounts for the density profile in the outer disc which is relatively flat close to the outer edge , steepens at smaller radii and finally becomes proportional to @xmath137 in the self - similar regime .",

    ". some additional limitations of the theory were pointed out by ludwig & meyer ( 1998 ) .",
    "it is standard in the theory of thin accretion discs to assume that the vertical structure of the disc is decoupled from its radial structure because the former evolves on much shorter timescales than the latter ( e.g. frank et al .",
    "1992 ) . because @xmath9 and @xmath158 vary on similar timescales , this assumption is no longer valid inside transition fronts : the vertical structure is coupled to the radial structure of the disc . in particular , radial transport of energy becomes important in the transition regions , while the transport occurs only vertically in steady thin discs ( frank et al .",
    "1992 ) .",
    "a correct treatment of the coupling between the radial and vertical structures of the disc would probably involve 2d simulations . for simplicity",
    ", however , the radial transport of energy is usually parameterized in a simple manner in 1d disc equations ( see also the approximations of decoupling used for the determination of the cooling rate @xmath26 , hmdlh ) . the fact that various prescriptions exist for @xmath33 ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : heat ] ) ) shows that the radial transport of energy in the disc is not well known , and surely not within a factor of a few .",
    "= 8.5 cm = 8.5 cm @xmath159    figure  [ fig : rad3speed ] shows the effect on the speed of heating fronts of increasing or decreasing by a factor @xmath160 the intensity of the term @xmath33 .",
    "the large uncertainty in @xmath33 translates into a significant uncertainty on the speed of heating fronts .",
    "( note that the speed of cooling fronts is not affected because the radial transport of energy has a minor influence on their structure ; cf fig .",
    "[ fig : cool ] ) .    an additional concern about the validity of the disc equations",
    "inside transition fronts comes from the narrowness of the fronts .",
    "lin et al . ( 1985 ) pointed out that having a front width @xmath161 , although it does not affect much the keplerian character of the flow , could lead to a rayleigh - unstable situation in the disc . a comparison between the criterion derived by lin et al .",
    "( 1985 ) and the structure of the narrow heating fronts found here suggests that this type of fronts may indeed experience the development of a rayleigh instability .",
    "this could result in an enhanced radial transport ( lin et al .",
    "1985 ) and an additional uncertainty in @xmath33 .",
    "the equations used in this study are only valid in the thin disc approximation , i.e. when radial pressure gradients can be neglected and both @xmath162 and @xmath163 are equal to the keplerian values .",
    "the effects of deviations from keplerianity and radial pressure gradients were shown , for instance , by ludwig & meyer ( 1998 ) using full hydrodynamical disc equations and by kley & lin ( 1996 ) in boundary layer computations .",
    "although these effects become non - negligible in narrow heating fronts , we do not expect our main results on the structure and properties of transition fronts to be affected if they were fully taken into account .",
    "this could be checked by taking the full equations , which is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "finally , we note that the use of a local @xmath2-prescription in narrow transition regions ( @xmath161 ) is also subject to caution because the approach of scale separation becomes much less rigorous on scales so close to the size of the `` turbulent eddies '' .",
    "our simulations show that transition fronts systematically experience a deceleration during their propagation in the disc , whatever their direction of propagation . yet , the front widths increase with radius in all the cases .",
    "this shows that the speed of a front is not directly related to its width ( see also a related claim by vishniac & wheeler 1996 for cooling fronts ) .",
    "a description according to which the width of a transition front , which defines the gradients and the fluxes in the front , also determines its speed thus appears oversimplified .",
    "our simulations reveal a qualitative agreement with one of the predictions of the theory of infinitely thin transition fronts ( meyer 1984 , 1986 ; see also papaloizou & pringle 1985 ) : we clearly observe that the speed of transition fronts is related to the proximity of @xmath9 in the disc to the critical values @xmath89 ( for cooling fronts ) and @xmath142 ( for heating fronts ) .    although ludwig et al .",
    "( 1994 ) pointed out that this theory may not be applicable to relatively broad cooling fronts , it could provide an explanation for the rapid deceleration of cooling fronts : the values of @xmath9 around the region where the cooling front appears are close to @xmath89 , so that the front speed is initially high ; soon , however , the front enters regions with larger and larger values of @xmath9 as compared to @xmath89 ( quasi - shakura - sunyaev profile ) , which results in a gradual decrease of the speed ; later , the front must wait for the inner hot disc to evolve on a viscous timescale , typically , before @xmath9 approaches @xmath89 in the disc , which explains the small speeds in the asymptotic regime .",
    "on the contrary , the speed of a heating front is able to remain large during the propagation , possibly because the profile of @xmath9 encountered in the disc is typically in between @xmath89 and @xmath142 ( cannizzo 1993b ) , i.e. not too far from @xmath142 everywhere in the disc . if this is true , the deceleration of heating fronts is due to the ( necessary ) proximity of @xmath9 to @xmath142 close to the ignition radius but not elsewhere in the disc .",
    "we have not considered the structure and properties of transition fronts close to @xmath23 in this paper . indeed , additional simulations show that in a small region close to the disc outer edge , transition fronts are affected in a complex way if @xmath23 is allowed to vary with time .",
    "the behavior of the fronts in this region of the disc may also depend sensitively on the precise choice of the outer boundary condition and how mass is deposited in the disc .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the structure and properties of transition fronts in thin accretion discs with detailed numerical calculations .",
    "we showed that heating fronts are very narrow and have complex structures .",
    "they propagate at a speed which depends on the profile of surface density in the disc , the radial transport term in the energy equation and the value of the viscosity parameter @xmath2 , but is typically of order a few @xmath164 .",
    "cooling fronts are broader , have a simpler structure and have smaller speeds ( of order a fraction of a km s@xmath1 ) than heating fronts .",
    "we found that their width is not equal to @xmath165 , but is rather @xmath166 , the local disc scale height , as for heating fronts .",
    "we confirmed that the structure of the inner hot disc is well described by a self - similar solution during the propagation of a cooling front .",
    "we proposed such a solution in which the surface density does not scale arbitrarily but with the value of the critical surface density @xmath89 .",
    "the self - similarity of the disc appears responsible for the periodicity of the outburst cycles in the simulations .",
    "since all our models show a deceleration of transition fronts during their propagation in the disc , the observation of such a deceleration would constitute a nice confirmation that the thermal - viscous disc instability , as we understand it , is responsible for the large amplitude variability of discs around white dwarfs , neutron stars and black holes .",

    "<S> we use high - resolution time - dependent numerical simulations of accretion discs around white dwarfs to study the structure and properties of transition fronts in the context of the thermal - viscous disc instability model . </S>",
    "<S> the thermal structure of cooling and heating fronts is dominated by radiative cooling and viscous heating , respectively , except in a very narrow precursor region in heating fronts where advection and radial transport of energy dominate . </S>",
    "<S> cooling fronts are much broader than heating fronts , but the widths of both types of fronts scale with the local vertical scale height of the disc . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm that during a fair fraction of the propagation time of a cooling front , the structure of the inner disc is close to self - similar . </S>",
    "<S> the speed of heating fronts is @xmath0 a few km s@xmath1 , while the speed of cooling fronts is @xmath0 a fraction of a km s@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that direct measurements of the speed of transition fronts probably can not discriminate between various prescriptions proposed for the viscosity parameter @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> . a natural prediction of the disc instability model is that fronts decelerate as they propagate in the disc , independent of the prescription for @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> observation of this effect would confirm that dwarf nova outbursts are driven by the thermal - viscous instability . most of our results also apply to low mass x - ray binaries in which the accreting object is a neutron star or a black hole .    </S>",
