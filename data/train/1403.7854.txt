    "presently , the number of asteroids is known to be more than 620,000 .",
    "most asteroids are , however , known only from their orbital data and their other properties are poorly constrained .",
    "in particular , size of asteroid , which is one of the most basic physical quantities , has been unknown for most asteroids .",
    "several techniques have been developed to determine the size of asteroid .",
    "one of the most effective methods for measuring asteroidal size and albedo indirectly is through the use of radiometry , where a combination of the thermal infrared flux and the absolute magnitude as the reflected sunlight .",
    "this radiometric method can provide unique data for asteroidal size and albedo .",
    "observations in mid - infrared wavelengths are suitable for studying asteroids with this method , particularly in the inner solar system inside the orbit of jupiter . using radiometric measurements",
    ", a large number of objects can be observed in a short period of time , providing coherent data for large populations of asteroids within the asteroid belt .",
    "infrared observations can be made still better under ideal circumstances , from space .",
    "the first space - borne infrared telescope is the infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ;  @xcite ) , launched in 1983 and performed a survey of the entire sky . to date , there are two other infrared astronomical satellites dedicated to all - sky surveys : the japanese infrared satellite akari  @xcite , and the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ;  @xcite ) .",
    "other space - borne infrared telescopes , e.g. , the midcourse space experiment ( msx ; @xcite ) , the infrared space observatory ( iso ; @xcite ) , the spitzer space telescope  @xcite , and the herschel space observatory  @xcite have conducted a series of observations with imaging and/or spectroscopy of asteroids . based on the all - sky survey data obtained by iras , akari , and wise ( hereafter i  a  w ) , the largest asteroid catalogs containing the size and albedo data were constructed . however , at present little is known about the consistency of these three catalogs of asteroidal data .",
    "performance of the on - board detectors and the survey strategies are different , the time and season of the observations and the duration of surveys are different , and the thermal model of asteroids adopted for determining size and albedo are different , between i  a  w . the relationship between these three catalogs should be checked in order to facilitate the use of these data sets for scientific purposes .    in this paper , we compare the asteroidal catalog data obtained by i  a  w to investigate the consistency and characteristics of these data sets and reveal some benefits of the usage of synthesized these three data for studying the physical properties of minor planets .",
    "we have reviewed each surveyor and its data set , and have compiled these data into a single data set .",
    "subsequently , we compare the number and distribution of the asteroids detected by these satellites , and discuss the completeness of the data sets obtained from each of the three satellites .",
    "in this paper the results obtained by iras , akari , and wise ( i  a ",
    "w ) are used .",
    "technical specifications of these three satellites are summarized in table  [ 3 satellites ] .",
    "a pioneering systematic asteroid survey with a space - borne telescope was made by iras in 1983 .",
    "iras performed a survey of the entire sky with a 57  cm aperture telescope in ten  months .",
    "the iras asteroid catalog was provided by @xcite as the supplemental iras minor planet survey ( simps ) .",
    "the simps includes the averaged results for 2,470 asteroids , which is 2,228 asteroids with at least two accepted observations and 242 that only have a single accepted sighting in a single band , by using the standard thermal model ( stm ;  @xcite ) .",
    "these data were revised by @xcite , which used the near - earth asteroid thermal model ( neatm ;  @xcite ) to derive asteroidal sizes and albedos , and which applied stricter criteria , selecting only objects with reported fluxes in three or four band - passes , and compiled the sizes and albedos for 1,483 objects .",
    "akari is a second - generation infrared all - sky surveyor following iras .",
    "akari conducted a 16-month survey in six wavelength bands from the mid- to far - infrared with a 68.5 cm aperture telescope . from many images taken in the mid - infrared part of the all - sky survey with the infrared camera ( irc ;  @xcite ) on board akari ,",
    "the infrared signals from asteroids were extracted and the asteroid catalog using akari ( acua ) was constructed , which contains the size and albedo data for 5,120 asteroids  @xcite . additionally , from the slow - scan observations in the pointed observation mode of akari , a serendipitous asteroidal catalog was constructed ( acua - iss ; @xcite ) , which includes data from 88 main belt asteroids .    the wise satellite , launched in december of 2009 , made a mapping of the whole sky in four bands in the near- to mid- infrared , with a 40  cm aperture telescope .",
    "while iras and akari conducted continuous scanning of the sky with horizontally aligned detector arrays along the attitude control of the satellites at a constant scan rate ( iras :  s@xmath3 , akari :  s@xmath3 ) , wise used a different approach .",
    "the payload of wise included a cryogenic scan mirror driven in a sawtooth pattern to cancel the orbital motion of the satellite , and to freeze the line of sight during each 11  s exposure interval ( actual exposure times were 7.7  s in 3.4 and 4.6  bands and 8.8  s in 12 and 22  bands ; @xcite ) , which achieves its wide field - of - view and high sensitivity .",
    "wise accomplished its four - band full cryogenic survey phase in seven  months , and continued survey observations for about six months after its cryogenic tanks became empty .",
    "the wise asteroid data set is the most recent and the largest asteroid catalog provided by an enhancement program called neowise  @xcite . the sizes and albedos of asteroids measured with wise",
    "are currently published as a series of papers : @xcite for the main belt asteroids , @xcite for the near - earth asteroids , @xcite for the jovian trojans , @xcite for the hilda group , and @xcite for the scattered disk objects and centaur populations .    in total , there are 137,837 asteroids in the wise data set with valid diameter and albedo information .",
    "figure  [ venn diagram ] shows the relationship between the number of asteroids detected with each of these surveyors in the form of a venn diagram .",
    "the number of asteroids detected with any three satellites is 138,285 , which is 22% of currently known asteroids with orbits , and all three satellites detected a common 1,993 asteroids .",
    "most objects were only detected with wise , because wise is about two orders of magnitude more sensitive than iras or akari at mid - infrared wavelengths ( table  [ 3 satellites ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , 448 asteroids were detected with only akari and/or iras .",
    "figure  [ hmag distribution ] shows the distribution of the absolute magnitude for all asteroids detected by i  a  w with known orbits and semimajor axes smaller than 6 au .",
    "this figure can be interpreted as reflecting the completeness of detections of known asteroids with the size and albedo data by three satellites .",
    "the akari asteroid catalog , which was constructed based on 16 months of the all - sky survey data , provides a 100% complete data set of all asteroids brighter than absolute magnitude of @xmath4 , which includes 40  km size asteroids at minimum ( and all main belt asteroids brighter than @xmath5 , corresponding to 20  km or larger objects ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is important to include the entire population of asteroids with @xmath4 for investigating the mass distribution of asteroids : asteroids with @xmath4 account for more than 90% of the total mass of all asteroids .",
    "while wise detected much smaller asteroids that peaked at @xmath6 , with corresponding diameter @xmath7  km , some larger ( and/or brighter ) objects were not detected .",
    "it is notable that the numbers of undetected asteroids that were brighter than @xmath4 are 23 for iras , 1 for akari , and 33 for wise , which are very small proportion of the total number of objects detected by each satellite .",
    "there is only one asteroids with @xmath4 that do not have measurements of its size and albedo so far : 1927  la ( @xmath8 = 8.81 ) .",
    "this belongs to the outer main belt asteroids and has an expected size of @xmath9  km , assuming albedo of @xmath10 .",
    "the discovery of 1927  la was reported in 1927 by albrecht kahrstedt at the heidelberg - knigstuhl observatory , germany , but it was a single - apparition with only three observations , and one of them was noted as being in question ( refer to astronomische nachrichten 232 , 257 ( 1928 ) and also to the minor planet center ) .",
    "no further follow - up observation has identified 1927  la since these studies and , as such , we consider its existence is doubtful at present .",
    "figure  [ fig : histogram of each 3 catalog ] illustrates the distribution of asteroids identified by i  a  w as a function of size and albedo .",
    "the size distribution in figure  [ fig : histogram of each 3 catalog ]  ( a ) shows diameter maxima at ca . @xmath11  km , 14  km , and 3  km for iras , akari , and wise , respectively .",
    "this suggests that asteroids larger than these limits are almost always detected by each satellite , but that the completeness of the catalog for each satellite decreases rapidly for asteroids smaller than these values .",
    "the albedo distribution in figure  [ fig : histogram of each 3 catalog ]  ( b ) exhibits a bimodal distribution : the primary peak is found around the geometric albedo of @xmath12 for each data set ; the secondary peaks are found at 0.16 for iras and akari , but at 0.25 for wise . in these three data sets ,",
    "there are extremely bright asteroids ( @xmath13 ) , which are all smaller than 55  km , and mostly smaller than 10  km , in the main belt as well as the near - earth region .",
    "the numbers of these anomalously high - albedo objects are , 5 in the iras catalog ( 0.20% of its total ) , 24 in the akari ( 0.46% ) , and 888 in the wise ( 0.64% ) .",
    "it should be noticed that brighter high - albedo objects are more likely to be discovered , identified , and photometrically measured in visible wavelengths , especially toward smaller sized objects ; in other words , the significant observational biases and selection effects still exist against darker and smaller objects .",
    "in contrast , infrared surveys are less biased against low albedo objects ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : comparing diameter ] and [ fig : comparing albedo ] show comparison of the sizes and albedos of the 1,993 asteroids commonly detected by i  a  w .",
    "comparisons between iras and akari , and between iras and wise have been studied  @xcite . from these figures , it is evident that the size and albedo measurements by all three satellites are in good agreement , although there are some systematic differences . in particular ,",
    "the diameters estimated by akari are larger than those by iras but smaller than those by wise .",
    "therefore , of these three data sets , wise yields the largest estimation of size , followed in order by akari and iras .",
    "conversely , iras yields the highest albedo , and wise the smallest albedo .",
    "this inverse relationship between size and albedo is unsurprising given that size is inversely proportional to the square root of albedo for a given absolute magnitude ( e.g. , @xcite ) as : @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath8 are the diameter in units of km , the geometric albedo , and the absolute magnitude , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig : histogram of akari , iras , wise commonly ] shows the distribution of the deviation of the sizes and albedos measured with i  a  w , from the respective mean values of those three data sets for the 1,993 commonly detected asteroids .",
    "the best - fit gaussian parameters for these distributions are listed in table [ gaussian fitting ] . as a result",
    ", they are in good agreement within @xmath010% in diameter and @xmath022% in albedo at 1@xmath1 deviation level .",
    "the survey period is one of the important factors for asteroid surveys in the infrared ( see table  [ 3 satellites ] ) .",
    "at least one year is required to survey all of the solar system bodies beyond a semimajor axis of 2  au with the surveyor in a fixed solar elongation of 90@xmath17 , while the inertial sky can be covered in half a year .",
    "the iras mission , which lasted ten  months , surveyed approximately 96% of the sky covered with two or more hours - confirming scans  @xcite . the all - sky survey conducted for 16 months by akari fully covered the main belt region , using a combination of 170 litres of super - fluid liquid helium and two sets of two - stage stirling cycle mechanical coolers  @xcite",
    "thus , the akari asteroid catalog provides a 100% complete data set of asteroids with @xmath4 , as mentioned above .",
    "the wise mission conducted a seven - month - long full cryogenic survey and a six - month - long post - cryogenic survey ( after depleting its cryogenic tanks ) . in the post - cryogenic phase , only the near - infrared channels ( 3.4 and 4.6  bands )",
    "were used . at these shorter wavelengths , asteroid fluxes",
    "are a mix of reflected sunlight and thermal emissions .",
    "nevertheless , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite produced reasonable estimates of the sizes and albedos of asteroids , assuming a relationship between visual albedo and infrared albedo , which are calibrated with data obtained in the full cryogenic phase .",
    "the differences between the mean sizes and albedos obtained by i  a  w are generally within @xmath1810% and @xmath1822% of each other , respectively ( at the 1@xmath1 standard deviation ) .",
    "these values are mostly larger than the uncertainties within each data set ( typically , 513% for diameter and 1033% for albedo ) .",
    "several possible reasons may explain the i  a  w differences .",
    "first , the different types of measurements do not fully include system uncertainties . also , several factors which may cause discrepancies originate from the physical properties of asteroids , such as their shape , thermal inertia , surface roughness , rotation rate , and pole orientation .",
    "asteroids are often elongated and irregularly shaped , and sometimes form binary systems , which generate lightcurve variance as they rotate .",
    "the asteroid lightcurve database @xcite indicates that , as of september 2013 , the mean value of the maximum amplitude of the lightcurve for the 5,730 available asteroids is @xmath19  mag .",
    "asteroids with larger amplitude lightcurves are likely to add to the uncertainty in establishing their size and albedo , especially for estimations based on single or a few sightings .",
    "in addition , uncertainties in the treatment of scattered sunlight in the visible wavelengths limit the accuracy of radiometric measurements .",
    "usually , simultaneous observations in visible and infrared wavelengths are not achieved . instead",
    ", the @xmath8@xmath20 system  @xcite is adopted to represent photometric values in visible wavelengths .",
    "uncertainties in the absolute magnitudes mainly impact the accuracy of the resulting albedo values  @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that a discrepancy exists between absolute magnitudes listed in the mpc orbit database and those measured by dedicated photometric observations over 30 years .",
    "they found that the mpc values are mostly too small for the 583 observed asteroids ; the mean offset of @xmath8 is @xmath21 to @xmath22 at @xmath23 .",
    "the slope parameter given in @xcite varies from @xmath24 to 0.55 ( mean , @xmath25 ) , while this value is often assumed to be @xmath26 .",
    "these discrepancies can account for the uncertainties in the estimated albedo , especially for @xmath27 .",
    "once improved measurements of @xmath8 become available , the values for the sizes and albedos can be revised .",
    "for example , @xcite devised a simple and convenient approximation for recalculating the size and albedo from improved @xmath8 values that does not require detailed thermal model calculations .",
    "saturation of the observed flux leads to another severe problem for larger asteroids .",
    "@xcite found that the iras observations of ( 1 )  ceres and ( 2 )  pallas showed unusual behaviors ( systematic wavelength variations ) as compared with the results of ground - based observations , perhaps due to saturation in 25 and 60  bands .",
    "while these point sources may be saturated , properly corrected values do not affect estimates of the sizes of other objects using the iras data  @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported that point sources detected with wise brighter than 0.88  jy in 12  band or 12.0  jy in 22  band show larger uncertainties owing to the onset of detector saturation .",
    "the former saturation level corresponds to the thermal emission from @xmath183070  km sized main belt asteroids .",
    "in contrast , no sign of saturation is apparent in the akari observations  @xcite ; in 18  band , recorded flux densities for ( 1 )  ceres were in the range of 500800  jy , and those for ( 4 )  vesta were in the range of 470600  jy , both of which are below the saturation limit ( d. ishihara , 2014 , private communication ) .",
    "the stm ( with some modification ) or the neatm can be used to characterize the physical properties of asteroids , although care should be exercised when applying these simple models to various types of asteroids .",
    "the stm produces good results if the asteroid has a small thermal inertia , rotates slowly , is observed at small solar phase angles , and is not heavily cratered or irregularly shaped ( i.e. , typical larger main belt asteroids ) . however , many asteroids are small irregular bodies with predominantly regolith - free rocky surfaces and relatively high thermal inertias  @xcite .",
    "most studies support the assumption that asteroid surfaces are generally heavily cratered and rough at all scales ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in combination with the lack of an atmosphere and small thermal skin depths",
    ", surface roughness gives rise to substantial temperature contrasts , even at small scales , and produces a _ beaming effect _ in which thermal emission is enhanced in the solar direction .",
    "a beaming parameter was introduced to adjust the surface temperature by compensating for the angular distribution of the thermal emission ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the beaming parameter physically correlates with the surface roughness and thermal inertia of an asteroid , and in practice , it can be considered as a normalization or calibration factor . for the iras catalog ,",
    "the stm was adopted as the thermal model , using a beaming parameter of @xmath28 , which was derived from observations of ( 1 )  ceres and ( 2 )  pallas using a ground - based telescope  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the size and albedo estimations of 60% of asteroids ( and @xmath29% of asteroids larger than 40  km ) detected by iras have been revised by a more robust estimation using the neatm , with @xmath30 values ranging from 0.75 to 2.75  @xcite .",
    "the akari asteroid catalog was processed using the `` modified '' stm , in which @xmath30 was determined separately for two observed mid - infrared bands ( @xmath30  =  0.87 for 9  band and 0.77 for 18  band ) , by comparing existing data from several different types of measurements for 55 asteroids ranging in diameter from 90 to 960  km ( see @xcite , table 11 ) .",
    "the wise results used the neatm with independently varying @xmath30 values , which were determined by fitting multiple observations using the wise data alone ; the results were then examined by comparisons with 49 unique objects with diameters ranging from 0.4 to 312  km ( data from several sources ; see @xcite , table 1 ) .",
    "the distribution of @xmath30 in the wise thermal model is shown for main belt asteroids in , for example , figure 6 of @xcite ( the mean value of their beaming parameters is @xmath31 , for asteroid diameters of @xmath32  km ) .    here , we consider the dependency of the size estimation on the value of the beaming parameter , under the conditions of the thermal model calculation .",
    "we assume an asteroid with given visible and thermal fluxes at given distances from the sun and an observer . once an incident solar flux is assumed , an absorbed flux is determined ( although it depends weakly on albedo ) .",
    "a larger @xmath30 causes lower surface temperatures of the thermal flux to balance the absorbed flux and the thermal emission .",
    "this can be easily found from the formulation of the temperature of the subsolar point ( @xmath33 ) on the surface of the asteroid ( e.g. , @xcite ) , as follows : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the bond albedo , @xmath36 is the solar flux at 1  au ( i.e. , the solar constant ) , @xmath30 is the beaming parameter , @xmath37 is the infrared emissivity , @xmath1 is the stefan  boltzmann constant , and @xmath38 is the heliocentric distance in units of au . a lower temperature implies a lower thermal flux per unit area . to provide the observed thermal flux ,",
    "a larger asteroid is needed , and a larger size is equivalent to a smaller albedo under a given flux in visible wavelengths .",
    "thus , larger @xmath30 values reflect larger sizes of asteroids .",
    "it should also be noted that there is a phase angle ( sun  target  observer angle ; @xmath39 ) dependency of the beaming parameter . in the stm",
    ", the temperature on the nightside of an asteroid is assumed to be zero , which is a reasonable assumption at small phase angles , where the dayside flux dominates ; i.e. , in the case of the main belt asteroids .",
    "however , @xcite pointed out that care must be exercised when applying simple thermal models to the near - earth asteroids because thermal model calculations based on observations made at larger solar phase angles are subject to relatively large uncertainties ; it was because of this that the neatm was developed  @xcite .",
    "as compared with main belt asteroids , the near - earth asteroids tend to have irregular shapes , and they are often observed at moderate to large solar phase angles ( @xmath40 ) , which is out of the valid range of the stm . if the nightside temperature is treated as non - zero , then the relationship between @xmath30 and @xmath39 can vary depending on the temperature distribution .",
    "based on the wise data obtained using the neatm , the average relationship between @xmath30 and @xmath39 is given as @xmath41  @xcite , or @xmath42  @xcite , although the spread around this value is large for @xmath43 .",
    "note that due to the constraints of the attitude control of infrared surveyors , the solar elongation angle of the wise observations is fixed at approximately @xmath44 , which means that the observing phase angle , heliocentric distance , and geocentric distance are strongly correlated .    the thermophysical model ( tpm , @xcite ) , which is a sophisticated approach for asteroid modeling , assuming a spherical body , is developed to derive the size , albedo , thermal inertia , and sense of rotation without assuming a value of the beaming parameter .",
    "@xcite discussed the validity of the tpm for a selected target by using only this simple spherical shape model .",
    "importantly , none of the i  a  w catalogs consider the irregular shapes of asteroids . while a non - rotating spherical body is assumed for asteroids in both the stm and neatm , the actual shapes of asteroids",
    "are generally elongated , especially in the cases of smaller asteroids .",
    "figure  [ fig : relative difference ] shows the relative differences between the diameters measured by i  a  w and the effective ( volume - equivalent ) diameters ( @xmath45 ) derived from the shape models determined by several methods : direct imaging with the hubble space telescope  @xcite , with the adaptive optics system on the w.m .",
    "keck ii telescope @xcite , or by spacecraft observations  km ) has also been observed by all three infrared surveyors.]@xcite , stellar occultation combined with lightcurve inversion techniques  @xcite , speckle interferometry  @xcite , and radar observations  @xcite . in total ,",
    "88 main belt asteroids ranging in size from 30 to 540  km are included .",
    "the relative difference is defined as @xmath46 , where @xmath47 refers to iras , akari , or wise .",
    "the mean values of the relative differences are 2.8% , 1.7% , and 7.5% for iras , akari , and wise , respectively , and the standard deviations for each are 1213  % .",
    "we found that the size derived by akari is closer to that derived by iras or wise .",
    "this is not a surprising result , as the beaming parameter adopted in the thermal model calculation in the akari catalog is calibrated with well - studied main belt asteroids larger than 90  km , whose size , shape , rotational properties , and albedo are known from different measurements , as mentioned above . in this respect ,",
    "the diameters obtained by radiometric measurements based on i  a  w are reliable in a statistical sense , which are smoothed out and averaged over a limited number of observations , even though the sizes obtained by radiometric and other measurements can be discrepant by up to 30% .",
    "a total of 138,285 asteroids were detected with three infrared all - sky surveyors : iras , akari , and wise , which enabled their sizes and albedos to be determined by the radiometric method .",
    "iras made a pioneering asteroid survey including 2,470 objects .",
    "akari resulted in a 100% complete survey for larger asteroids ( @xmath4 , corresponding 40  km or larger ) in its 16-month mission .",
    "wise has significantly improved the number of smaller sized asteroids detected ( @xmath48 , corresponding 1.5  km or larger ) as a result of its higher sensitivity compared with iras and akari .",
    "1,993 asteroids were commonly detected by all three satellites , and the size and albedo measurements of these asteroids by each satellite are in good agreement ( within @xmath010% for diameter and @xmath022% for albedo ) .",
    "the data sets from these three satellites complement one another and will provide an important database for statistical analysis of asteroid populations and characterizing the physical properties of each asteroid .",
    "this study is based on observations with akari , a jaxa project with the participation of esa .",
