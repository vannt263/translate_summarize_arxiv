    "[ fig : lbl ] can be calculated in light muonic atoms ( for simplicity we consider further muonic hydrogen ) within the static - muon approximation , in which the complete muon - line factor shrinks to @xmath41where @xmath42 is the total momentum transfer to the muon line , @xmath43 is the wave function and the error is of the order of @xmath19 .",
    "let us first compare the related diagrams with free nr fermion propagators ( cf .",
    "[ fig : eq ] ) .",
    "the expressions for the muon and proton lines are identical .",
    "apparently , one can approximate the proton line within the external field approach or , which is the same , by a static proton . to transform the complete nr expressions to the static - proton case",
    ", we have to neglect the proton kinetic energy in the proton propagators .",
    "once that is done , after a chain of identities we should arrive at the external - field approximation .    a reason to neglect",
    "the energy is the fact that a characteristic energy , related to a particle of the mass @xmath44 , is @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is a characteristic atomic momentum .",
    "one can prove that we can expand using small parameters @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",

    "the parameter @xmath47 ( and the related error ) differs indeed for a muon and proton , but it is small for both .",
    "meantime , in reality the situation for a muon and a proton is somewhat different .",
    "the muon characteristic momentum is of the same order as the electron mass @xmath49 , and we should treat it as a bound one .",

    "the characteristic energy of an intermediate state is indeed of order of magnitude of the atomic bound energy @xmath52 and we can neglect it , as we already did in the case of the free propagators .",

    "<S> these contributions are due to free vacuum polarization loops as well as to various effects of light - by - light scattering . </S>",

    "<S> recent progress of the psi experiment on the lamb shift in muonic hydrogen @xcite has attracted interest to theory of the lamb shift in light muonic atoms . their study can provide us with information on certain nuclear structure effects with accuracy that is not available in any other experiment .    to obtain such data </S>",
    "<S> , one has to be able to separate quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) effects from the nuclear structure effects , and for this purpose an adequate qed theory providing high accuracy is required . </S>",
    "<S> contributions to the energy levels in light muonic atoms and , in particular , to the lamb shift fall into a few different well - distinguished classes . </S>",
    "<S> a specific theory stands behind each of them . </S>",
    "<S> there are corrections , the evaluation of which is identical for hydrogen and muonic hydrogen , and corrections that are specific for muonic atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the latter involve a certain part of qed , recoil effects and effects of the finite nuclear size . </S>",
    "<S> an important class of such specific contributions , which , in fact , also include the dominant term for the lamb shift , is due to non - relativistic physics .    </S>",
    "<S> we remind that atomic momenta in light muonic atoms @xmath1 are compatible with the electron mass , while the atomic energy @xmath2 is much smaller than the electron mass . </S>",
    "<S> ( the relativistic units in which @xmath3 are applied throughout the paper . ) </S>",

    "<S> the loops may be for either free - loop vacuum - polarization ( vp ) effects , related to the uehling , kllen - sabry potential and higher - order diagrams , or the to light - by - light ( lbl ) scattering contributions .    </S>",

    "<S> the results have been obtained in @xcite and we confirm the deuterium result @xcite and obtain a result for a muonic helium ion @xmath9 which is consistent with @xmath10mev of @xcite , but more accurate , and strongly disagrees with @xmath11mev of @xcite .    in our calculation </S>",
    "<S> we used approximations for the wichmann - kroll potential in the form @xmath12   </S>",
    "<S> \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as discussed in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and @xmath13 as considered in @xcite and @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the results are consistent . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , if higher accuracy is required , one can apply an exact expression @xcite for @xmath15 as a two - dimensional integral .    the second term ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : lbl]@xmath8 ) is called ` virtual - delbrck - scattering contribution ' . </S>",
    "<S> it has been calculated for muonic hydrogen in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation was based on @xcite , where at first a scattering approximation was applied and subsequently a number of further approximations was made . </S>",
    "<S> we remind that the scattering approximation suggests that the external muon legs in the diagram in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : lbl]@xmath8 are on - shell ( i.e. @xmath16 ) and the muon propagator there is substituted for a free one , i.e. , the kinematics is exactly the same if one calculates a related born scattering amplitude . since atomic momenta @xmath17 in light muonic atoms are compatible with the electron mass @xmath18 , the validity of such an approximation is questionable ( see , e.g. , the discussion in @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we , however , have proved that the scattering approximation is applicable within the uncertainty of order @xmath19 ( in fractional units ) , which is at the level of about 1% in muonic hydrogen and deuterium and of about 4% in muonic helium . </S>",
    "<S> that is also correct for other simplifying approximations , which were made in the calculations for this contribution in light muonic atoms @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a general idea of our evaluation is presented in appendix  [ s : a ] , while the details of our evaluation are to be published elsewhere @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> eventually , we conclude that the uncertainty of the method applied in @xcite is substantially smaller than the uncertainty of the related numerical evaluations for the lamb shift correction in muonic hydrogen @xcite , muonic deuterium @xcite and muonic helium-4 ion @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the contribution in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : lbl]@xmath7 has no specific name . </S>",
    "<S> since any other lbl contribution has one ( ` wichmann - kroll term ' and ` virtual - delbrck - scattering contribution ' ) , sometimes it is referred to as a ` light - by - light contribution ' , which is somewhat confusing </S>",
    "<S> .    this contribution has remained uncalculated for a while . </S>",
    "<S> studying applicability of the scattering approximation for the diagram in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : lbl]@xmath8 , we have also managed to prove @xcite that this remaining contribution can be expressed in terms of the well - known wichmann - kroll term @xmath20 the uncertainty of this identity is of order @xmath19 ( in fractional units ) , which is at the level of about 1% in muonic hydrogen and deuterium and of about 4% in muonic helium .    by combining our results on the uncertainty of various approximations with the numerical results of other authors , </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the complete result for all lbl contributions of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : lbl ] . </S>",
    "<S> the result is listed in the summary table ( table  [ t : sum ] ) .    with identity </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 3:1 ] ) proved and a possibility to obtain a result for the wichmann - kroll ( @xmath21 ) with high accuracy for any light muonic atom , the uncertainty in the calculation of the complete lbl contribution now comes from the virtual - delbrck - scattering term , which should determine the eventual uncertainty of the non - relativistic @xmath0 term for muonic hydrogen , deuterium and helium - ion .    another major non - relativistic contribution in order @xmath0 is due to vacuum polarization contributions . </S>",
    "<S> the vp terms of this order were studied for muonic hydrogen in @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the most complicated terms are indeed related to the first line of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : vp ] , however , these diagrams were cross - checked due to their contributions to the anomalous magnetic moment of muon @xcite and we can rely on them .    </S>",
    "<S> the contributions of the second line of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : vp ] are specific for muonic atoms and do not correlate directly with any calculation for the muon @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> those have been recalculated completely independently of @xcite , as well as part of diagrams in the first line .    </S>",
    "<S> we confirm the second - order terms of nrpt , while our result @xcite for the third - order term ( the last diagram in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : vp ] ) disagrees with the one originally published in @xcite . </S>",
