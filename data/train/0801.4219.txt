    "<S> we suggest an extension of the standard concept of statistical ensembles . </S>",
    "<S> namely , we introduce a class of ensembles with extensive quantities fluctuating according to an externally given distribution . as an example the influence of energy fluctuations on multiplicity fluctuations in limited segments of momentum space for a classical ultra - relativistic gas is considered .    </S>",
    "<S> successful application of the statistical model to hadron production in high energy collisions ( see , e.g. , recent papers  @xcite and references therein ) has stimulated investigations of properties of statistical ensembles of relativistic hadronic gases . whenever possible , one prefers to use the grand canonical ensemble ( gce ) due to its mathematical convenience . </S>",
    "<S> the canonical ensemble ( ce )  @xcite should be applied when the number of carriers of a conserved charges is small ( of the order of 1 ) , such as strange hadrons  @xcite , antibaryons  @xcite , or charmed hadrons @xcite , in otherwise large systems . </S>",
    "<S> the micro - canonical ensemble ( mce )  @xcite has been used to describe small systems ( with total number of produced particles less than or equal to  10 ) with additionally fixed energy , and momentum , e.g. elementary particle collisions or annihilation . in these cases , </S>",
    "<S> calculations performed in different statistical ensembles yield different results . </S>",
    "<S> hence , ensembles are not equivalent , and systems are ` far away ' from the thermodynamic limit ( tl ) .    </S>",
    "<S> measurement of hadron multiplicity distributions @xmath0 in relativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions opens another interesting field of investigations . </S>",
    "<S> the average number of produced hadrons ranges from @xmath1 to @xmath2 , and mean multiplicities ( of light hadrons ) obtained within gce , ce , and mce approach each other . </S>",
    "<S> one refers here to the thermodynamical equivalence of statistical ensembles and uses the gce for fitting experimentally measured mean multiplicities . </S>",
    "<S> however , the number of particles fluctuates event - by - event . </S>",
    "<S> these fluctuations are usually quantified by the ratio of variance to mean value of a multiplicity distribution @xmath0 , the scaled variance , and are a subject of current experimental activities . in statistical models </S>",
    "<S> there is a qualitative difference in the properties of mean multiplicity and scaled variance of multiplicity distributions . </S>",
    "<S> it was recently found @xcite that even in the tl corresponding results for the scaled variance are different in different ensembles . </S>",
    "<S> hence the equivalence of ensembles holds for mean values in the tl , but does not extend to fluctuations .    </S>",
    "<S> statistical mechanics is usually formulated through the following steps . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , one fixes the system s extensive quantities : volume @xmath3 , energy @xmath4 , momentum @xmath5 , and conserved charges @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , one postulates that all microstates have equal probability of being realized . </S>",
    "<S> this defines the mce . </S>",
    "<S> the ce introduces temperature @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> each set of microstates with fixed energy @xmath4 ( a macrostate ) is weighted with the boltzmann factor @xmath8 . the probability to find a macrostate with energy @xmath4 in the ce is then proportional to the number of all microstates with energy @xmath4 times the boltzmann factor @xmath8 . to define the gce , </S>",
    "<S> one makes a similar construction for conserved charges @xmath6 and introduces chemical potentials @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> canonical or grand canonical observables can then be obtained by averaging over the ce energy distribution or the gce ( joint- ) distribution of both energy and conserved charges .    </S>",
    "<S> fluctuations in statistical systems , e.g. , multiplicity distributions @xmath0 in relativistic gases @xcite , are sensitive to conservation laws obeyed by the system , and therefore to fluctuations of extensive quantities . for calculation of multiplicity distributions , the choice of statistical ensemble is then not a matter of convenience , but a physical question . </S>",
    "<S> fluctuations of extensive quantities @xmath10 around their average values depend not on the system s physical properties , but rather on external conditions . </S>",
    "<S> one can imagine a huge variety of these conditions , thus , mce , ce , gce , or pressure ensembles @xcite are only some special examples .    </S>",
    "<S> a more general statistical ensemble can be defined by an externally given distribution of extensive quantities , @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> all microstates with a fixed set @xmath12 are taken to be equiprobable . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the probability @xmath13 of finding the system in a macrostate with fixed @xmath12 and additionally fixed multiplicity @xmath14 is given by the ratio of the number of microstates with fixed @xmath14 and @xmath12 to the number of microstates with fixed @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the construction of multiplicity distributions in such an ensemble proceeds in two steps . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , the mce multiplicity distribution , @xmath13 , at fixed values of the extensive quantities @xmath12 is calculated . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , this result is averaged over the external distribution @xmath11 , @xmath15 the ensemble defined by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ p ] ) , the @xmath16-ensemble , includes the standard statistical ensembles as particular cases .    </S>",
    "<S> let us illustrate above statements for a simple system of non - interacting massless particles , neglecting the effects of quantum statistics ( boltzmann approximation ) . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ p ] ) we choose : @xmath17 to calculate the multiplicity distribution @xmath18 in the presence of an energy distribution @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> we will firstly discuss the mce multiplicity distribution @xmath20 and then solve the integral ( [ palphan ] ) for a particular choice of @xmath19 in the large volume limit .    </S>",
    "<S> the mce multiplicity distribution is given by  @xcite , @xmath21 where @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the particle s degeneracy factor . </S>",
    "<S> the mce partition function @xmath24 is defined by the normalization condition , @xmath25 . in the tl , @xmath26 in eq.([pmce ] ) , one finds from the raw moments @xmath27  : @xmath28 additionally it follows from the equivalence of statistical ensemble that gce and mce values for average multiplicity are equal to each other , @xmath29 , where the temperature @xmath7 of the gce is found from @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> momentum spectra in the mce also converge to gce boltzmann spectra under this limit . </S>",
    "<S> multiplicity fluctuations , expressed by the scaled variances , are however different , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .    in the tl </S>",

    "<S> we consider a system with fixed large volume @xmath3 . as an illustrative example we will use the following asymptotic form of energy distribution , @xmath37~,\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the gce energy expectation value and @xmath39 is the scaled variance of gce energy fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> this choice for @xmath19 results in a simple correspondence to the gce and mce in the large volume limit . in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ p_alpha_e ] ) , @xmath16 is a dimensionless tuneable parameter for the width of the distribution . in the mce limit @xmath40 , </S>",

    "<S> ( [ p_alpha_e ] ) becomes a dirac @xmath41-function , @xmath42 . for @xmath43 , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ p_alpha_e ] ) results in the gce energy fluctuations ( [ pgcee ] ) in the tl @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the physical interpretation of the gce energy fluctuations corresponds to an ` infinite heat bath ' . </S>",

    "<S> the case of @xmath45 we would like to denote as ` strong ' energy fluctuations .    </S>",
    "<S> lastly we note that the mce distribution @xmath20 can be conveniently presented in terms of the gce distributions @xcite , @xmath46 . at fixed volume @xmath3 , the gce distribution @xmath47 is given by eq .  </S>",

    "<S> ] ) are thermodynamically equivalent </S>",
    "<S> . energy and multiplicity fluctuations are however different .    as a next step </S>",
    "<S> we want to discuss the effect of energy fluctuations , eq.([p_alpha_e ] ) , on multiplicity fluctuations in limited segments of momentum space for a classical ultra - relativistic gas in the tl . the results for the scaled variances , @xmath75  , in different momentum bins @xmath61 are shown in fig .  1 for several values of parameter @xmath16 . as in ref.@xcite , </S>",
    "<S> each momentum bin @xmath76 $ ] contains the same fraction @xmath77 of the total average multiplicity , @xmath78 .    in the mce ( @xmath65 ) , </S>",
    "<S> multiplicity fluctuations are essentially suppressed with respect to the gce ( @xmath67 ) . </S>",
    "<S> global energy conservation in the mce introduces correlations in momentum space  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the larger the fraction of the total energy in a given momentum bin , the stronger is the mce suppression effect ( @xmath65 in fig .  1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath79 the suppression effects become weaker . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath67 corresponds to the gce results for multiplicity fluctuations : @xmath80 , both in full momentum space , and in different momentum bins . for ` strong ' energy fluctuations , @xmath81 </S>",
    "<S> , we find an increase of multiplicity fluctuations with increasing bin momentum , as shown in fig .  1 .    in order to make a quantitative comparison with present and future data on multiplicity fluctuations in relativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions one needs to extend essentially the formulation considered in this letter . </S>",
    "<S> please note that eqs.([palphan],[p_alpha_e]-[p_e_n ] ) can be readily generalized to more complicated cases of non - zero particle masses , quantum statistics , many particle species , several conserved charges , and multiplicity fluctuations in limited segments of momentum space . </S>",
    "<S> in all these cases the expressions for @xmath13 and @xmath82 are already obtained @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the mce multiplicity distributions in systems with full hadron - resonance spectrum and quantum statistics effects were presented in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the role of momentum conservation was discussed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the next step would be an extension of this formulation to an external distributions @xmath83 , e.g. , taking into account fluctuations of energy @xmath4 , momentum @xmath5 , and three abelian charges - baryon number @xmath84 , strangeness @xmath85 , and electric charge @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> this is to be done according to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ p ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> fluctuations and correlations of the extensive quantities presented by the distribution @xmath87 could then be connected to measured fluctuations of hadron multiplicities in limited segments of momentum space . </S>",
    "<S> this will be a subject of future studies .    in this letter we suggested to extend the concepts of statistical ensembles and introduced the @xmath16-ensemble defined by an external distribution of extensive quantities . </S>",
    "<S> the key assumption used for calculation of multiplicity distributions is the ` equiprobability ' of all microstates with the same set of extensive quantities . </S>",
    "<S> we have discussed a simple example of a gas composed of classical massless particles to demonstrate the effects of energy fluctuations on multiplicity fluctuations in full momentum space and in limited segments of momentum space . </S>",
    "<S> measurement of event - by - event multiplicity fluctuations in different momentum bins correspond to current experimental studies of hadron production in relativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions . </S>",
    "<S> we believe also that the concept of statistical ensembles with fluctuating extensive quantities may be appropriate in other situations too . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , in all cases when fluctuations of extensive quantities are a subject of interest and can be measured experimentally .    </S>",
