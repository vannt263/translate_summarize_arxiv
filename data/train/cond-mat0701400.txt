    "the effect of external magnetic fields in the quantum properties of low - dimensional magnets has been of much interest in recent years .",
    "experimental and theoretical studies of these systems have revealed a plethora of quantum flactuation phenomena , not usally observed in higher dimensions .",
    "the magnetization processes in antiferromagnetic ( af ) spin chains and ladders have been under intensive investigation using novel numerical techniques .",
    "the progress in the experimental front is achived by introduction of high - field neutron scattering studies and synthesis of magnetic quasi - one dimensional systems such as the spin-@xmath5 antiferromagnet cu benzoate @xcite and @xmath6 @xcite . due to these developments",
    "we can now observe the effect of a staggered magnetic field ( or even more complicated interactions ) on the low energy behavior of a one - dimentional quantum model in the laboratory .",
    "there exist different mechanisms for generating a staggered field in a real magnet @xcite . in cu benzoate the alternating crystal axes is the source of such a field .",

    "@xcite have studied how an effective staggered field is generated by dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interaction if the crystal symmetry is sufficiently low .",
    "they showed that in the presence of dm interaction along the af chain , an applied uniform field @xmath7 generates an effective staggered field @xmath8 . ignoring small residual anisotropies",
    ", they obtained an effective hamiltonian where a one - dimensional heisenberg af chain is placed in perpendicular uniform ( @xmath0 ) and staggered ( @xmath1 ) fields @xmath9\\label{hamiltonian}\\ ] ] it is expected @xcite that the staggered field induces an excitation gap in the @xmath10 heisenberg antiferromagnetic ( af ) chain , which should be otherwise gapless .",
    "such as excitation gap caused by the staggered field is indeed found in real magnets @xcite .    in the absence of the staggered magnetic field ( @xmath11 ) and the uniform magnetic field ( @xmath12 ) , the spectrum is gapless . in the ground state ,",
    "the system is in the spin - fluid phase , where the decay of correlations fallow a power low . when a uniform magnetic field is applied the spectrum of the system",
    "remains gapless until a critical field @xmath13 , is reached . here",
    "a phase transition of the pokrovsky - talapov type @xcite occurs and the ground state becomes a completely ordered ferromagnetic state @xcite . since the uniform magnetic field does not destroy the exact integrability of the heisenberg model , the eigenspectra is exactly solvable . applying a staggered magnetic field ,",
    "the integrability is lost .",
    "the application of a staggered magnetic field when @xmath12 , produces an antiferromagnetically ordered ( neel order ) ground - state and induces a gap in the spectrum of the model .",
    "heisenberg model in both staggered and uniform fields has been recently studied @xcite using density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) .",
    "it is shown that bound midgap states generally exist in open boundary af - heisenberg chains .",
    "the gap and midgap energies in the thermodynamic limit are obtained by extrapolating numerical results of small chain sizes up to 200 sites .",
    "it is revealed that some of the gap and midgap energies for the half - integer spin chains fit well to a scaling function derived from the quantum sine - gordon model , but other low energy excitations do not fit equally well .    in this paper , we present the numerical results obtained on the low - energy states of the 1d af - heisenberg model in both uniform and staggered fields using an exact diagonalization technique for finite systems .",
    "we calculate the spin gap as a function of applied staggered field in the presence of small uniform field ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "with respect to the range of the staggered magnetic field , we show that there are two regimes in which we can compute the real critical exponent of the energy gap and it is important to note to which one of these regimes the numerical data are related . in sec .",
    "ii we discuss the scaling behavior of the gap using the available limiting behaviors .",
    "the leading exponent of the staggered field @xmath1 , depends on @xmath0 boath in finite size and thermodynamic limit . in sec .",
    "iii , we explain how , in certain limits the numerical calculations may produce incorrect result for the critical exponent .",
    "we apply a perturbative approach@xcite to find the correct critical exponent in the small-@xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) regime . in sec .",
    "iv , we increase the scaling parameter @xmath15 and find the correct critical exponent in the large-@xmath15 regime .",
    "finally , the summary and discussion are presented in sec . v.",
    "in the high field neutron - scattering experiment on cu benzoate @xcite , which is a quasi - one dimensional @xmath10 antiferromagnet , the magnetic field induces a gap in excitation spectrum of the magnet .",
    "the observed gap is proportional to @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the magnitude of the applied field .",
    "this exponent of about @xmath19 describing the field dependence of the gap obtained in different experiments @xcite identify the source of this gap as the staggered field .    using bosonization techniques ,",
    "affleck et.al showed that , the gap scales as @xmath20 where @xmath4 is the critical exponent of the gap and when @xmath0 is stricly @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "the @xmath0-dependence of the exponent @xmath4 is studied numerically in ref.[15 ] .",
    "their approach is based on the @xmath23-exponent , defined through the static structure factor of the model in the absence of a staggered field ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "they show that there is a relation between the critical exponent of the gap and @xmath23-exponent .",
    "then by computing the @xmath23-exponent of the structure factor of the model , they predict the @xmath0-dependence of @xmath4 .",
    "similarly , in an interesting recent work @xcite , the effect of an external field on the gap of the 2d af heisenberg model with dm interaction has been studied .",
    "it is shown that the effect of the external field on the gap can be predicted by investigating the on - site magnetization of the model .",
    "here we study the evolution of the gap , using the conformal estimates of the small perturbation @xmath24 , and the finite size scaling estimates of the energy eigenvalues of the small chains in the presence of the staggered field ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "we argue that there are two regimes in which the real critical exponent can be numerically calculated and it is very important to note to which one of these regimes the numerical data are related .",
    "let us rewrite the hamiltonian ( 1 ) in the form @xmath26 \\nonumber \\\\ v&=&h\\sum_{j } ( -1)^{j } s_{j}^{z } , \\label{efh6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is exactly solvable by the bethe ansatz and the staggered field @xmath24 is very small .",
    "for a small perturbation v , we can use conformal estimates .",
    "the large distance asymptotic of the correlation function of the model in the absence of the staggered field @xmath28 is obtained @xcite as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a function of the uniform ( @xmath0 ) field and is found using the bethe ansatz as @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 . by investigating the perturbed action for the model and performing an infinitesimal renormalization group with a scale @xmath34 , one can show that the staggered magnetic field scales as @xmath35 which leads that the energy gap scales as eq.([e5 ] ) by critical exponent @xmath36 which is also obtained with the bosonization technique in ref.[7 ] .",
    "for example , in the absence of a uniform magnetic field , @xmath37 , in agreement with the bosonization and experimental results . since",
    ", by increasing the uniform field @xmath0 , @xmath30 decreases , thus we can conclude that the critical gap exponent @xmath4 drops with increasing uniform field @xmath0 .    to make a numerical check on effect of the uniform field on the energy gap we have implemented the modified lanczos algorithm @xcite on finite - size chains ( @xmath38 ) using periodic boundary conditions to calculate the energy gap .",
    "we have computed the energy gap for different chain lengths in the cases of the uniform fields @xmath14 .",
    "the energy gap as a function of the chain length ( @xmath39 ) , uniform ( @xmath0 ) and staggered ( @xmath1 ) fields is defined as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the ground state energy and @xmath42 is the first excited state . in the absence of staggered field ( @xmath11 )",
    ", the spectrum of the af heisenberg model is gapless up to @xmath43 .",
    "the gap vanishes in the thermodynamic limit proportional to the inverse of the chain length @xcite @xmath44 the coefficient a is known exactly from the bethe ansatz solution @xcite and also can be computed in principle by the methods of conformal invariance and finite - size scaling @xcite .",
    "when the staggered field is applied , a non zero gap develops .",
    "thus the staggered field @xmath45 is a critical point for our model . in general , the critical point of an infinite system is defined , in the hamiltonian formulation , as the value of @xmath1 , @xmath46 , at which the mass gap @xmath47 vanishes as eq.([e5 ] ) . with our lanczos scheme",
    "we can compute @xmath48 , which approaches @xmath47 when n is large .",
    "the natural measure of the deviation of the finite system from the infinite one is @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the linear dimension of the finite system ( @xmath51 , a is the lattice spacing ) and @xmath52 is the correlation length of the infinite system ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "thus , we assume that @xmath48 depends on @xmath1 through @xmath49 as @xmath54 where @xmath16 is a scaling parameter , and @xmath55 is the scaling function .",
    "as expected , this equation behaves in the combined limit @xmath56 as eq.(@xmath57 ) , thus we assume the asymptotic form of the scaling function @xmath55 @xmath58 in addition , we need a factor to cancel the n - dependence of @xmath55 as @xmath59 .",
    "this factor must be of the form @xmath60 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath61 if we multiply both sides of eq.([dgap ] ) by @xmath39 we get @xmath62 eq.([ngap ] ) shows that the large-@xmath15 behavior of @xmath63 is linear in @xmath15 where the scaling exponent of the energy gap is @xmath4 .     at the fixed uniform field @xmath12 , versus the chain length @xmath38 .",
    "the best fit is obtained by @xmath64 . in the inset , the function @xmath65 is plotted versus n at the uniform field @xmath66 and the best fit is obtained by @xmath67 . data for different staggered fields",
    "@xmath68 fall exactly on each other.,width=302 ]",
    "since the scaling of the gap can only be observed in the thermodynamic limit and for very small value of @xmath1 , we compute the energy gap of the model for several values of staggered field @xmath69 and different chain lengths @xmath70 for fixed uniform fields @xmath14 .",
    "we have plotted the values of @xmath71 versus @xmath72 for @xmath73 .",
    "the results have been computed on a chain with the periodic boundary conditions . according to eq.([ngap ] ) , we have found from our numerical results that the linear behavior is very well satisfied by @xmath74 independent of h. this is very far from the correct value of critical exponent @xmath75 ( eq.(@xmath76 ) ) .",
    "note that the horizontal axes values in the small-@xmath15 regime are limited to very small values of @xmath77 .",
    "thus , we are not allowed to obtain the real scaling exponent of the gap which exists in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath78 or @xmath79 ) .",
    "when @xmath15 is small , or in other words @xmath1 is very small , we might be away from the thermodynamic behavior to observe the correct scaling .",
    "for very small @xmath1 in the finite size systems ( @xmath80 ) the value of @xmath15 will be small ( @xmath81 ) , which avoid us to get the information on the large-@xmath15 behavior of the scaling function @xmath55 . in this case",
    ", the values of the energy gap coming from a finite system are basically representing the perturbative behavior @xcite , which we reproduce for the convenience .",
    "we start from the hamiltonian eq.(@xmath82 ) .",
    "the energy eigenstates of the @xmath27 carry momentum @xmath83 or @xmath84 @xmath85 where , t is translation operator and @xmath86 are eigenstates of unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath27 .",
    "since the operator @xmath87 changes the momentum of the state by @xmath88 , we obtain that @xmath89 thus , the gap can be rewritten in the following form @xmath90 where @xmath91 is an integer .",
    "it is a good approximate to neglect the effect of higher order terms for @xmath92 . because the second - order perturbation correction is not zero in the staggered field",
    ", the leading nonzero term is @xmath93 .",
    "if the small-@xmath15 behavior of the scaling function is defined as @xmath94 , we find that @xmath95 this shows that in the small-@xmath15 regime , @xmath96 is a linear function of @xmath97 .",
