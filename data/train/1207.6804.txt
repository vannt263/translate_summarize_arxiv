    "this suggests that an effective way to excite these phonon modes is through a coupling with the spin degree of freedom as recently achieved in two - photon bragg experiments on fermi gases @xcite . for sound waves propagating in the direction orthogonal to @xmath8",
    "the situation is instead different .",
    "in particular in phase iii sound waves are purely density oscillations ( @xmath209 ) .",
    "a major usefulness of the hydrodynamic equations is that they can be easily extended to trapped non - uniform configurations . in the simplest @xmath210 case ,",
    "corresponding to @xmath211 , where the wave vector @xmath212 is density - independent , the chemical potential is given by the bogoliubov form @xmath213 with @xmath214 independent of the density , in both phase ii and phase iii , and the 3d hydrodynamic equations can be reduced to the compact form : @xmath215 \\label{hddeltan}\\ ] ] here @xmath48 is the thomas - fermi density profile given , in the presence of harmonic trapping @xmath216 , by an inverted parabola : @xmath217/g$ ] , with @xmath218 fixed by the normalization condition .",
    "one can easily check that all the solutions holding for usual becs @xcite still hold in the presence of spin - orbit coupling , with the simple replacement of the trapping frequency @xmath219 with @xmath220 .",
    "this reproduces the result @xmath221 derived in @xcite for the frequency of the dipole oscillation along the @xmath8-axis using a sum rule approach and also shows that the frequency of the other hydrodynamic modes involving a motion of the gas along the @xmath8 axis will be quenched .",
    "the quenching of the dipole mode due to spin - orbit coupling has been recently observed in the experiment of @xcite .",
    "in conclusion we have investigated the dynamic behavior of a bose - einstein condensate with spin - orbit coupling , pointing out the occurrence of novel features of high relevance for future experiments , like the strong quenching exhibited by the sound velocity near the second - order transition between the plane wave and the zero momentum phases , the anisotropy of the compressibility , and the occurrence of a roton minimum in the excitation spectrum .",
    "our theoretical predictions can be tested in future experiments bases on two - photon bragg spectroscopy and are expected to deeply influence the superfluid behavior of the gas .",
