    "with firm evidence for a higgs boson with a mass around @xmath8gev , the primary focus of particle physics has now shifted to the study of the properties of this new particle , in particular of its couplings .",
    "an important channel in this context is higgs - boson production with subsequent decay into a @xmath9 pair , for which both atlas and cms have recently reported @xmath10 evidence @xcite . with a branching ratio of about 22% ,",
    "this is the second largest decay channel of the higgs boson . because of the missing energy in the final state , the @xmath9 channel is not particularly well suited for a higgs mass measurement , but it offers the possibility for a precise higgs coupling measurement and spin studies .",
    "a challenge is posed by the large background from @xmath11 production , which , after the top - quarks decay , results in a @xmath9 pair in association with two @xmath12-quark jets .",
    "this background is significantly reduced by rejecting events containing jets with transverse momentum above a certain threshold @xmath13 , which is chosen around 2530gev in current experimental analyses .",
    "imposing such a jet veto enhances the higher - order qcd corrections to the higgs - boson production cross section by sudakov logarithms of the form @xmath0 , with @xmath14 .",
    "one might argue that these logarithms are not particularly large for the relevant values of @xmath13 ; however , even the total higgs production rate suffers from large corrections , and additional enhancements can easily lead to unreliable predictions . for the fixed - order predictions of the production cross section with a jet veto ,",
    "it was observed that there is a numerical cancellation between the negative corrections from sudakov logarithms and the large positive virtual corrections to the total rate , which leads to artificially small scale uncertainties @xcite . to avoid this cancellation and get a more reliable estimate of the theoretical uncertainties ,",
    "it was subsequently proposed to add in quadrature the scale uncertainties of the total cross section and the cross section with one or more jets in the final state , which leads to an uncertainty of 17% on the higgs production cross section with a jet veto @xcite .",
    "this uncertainty is about twice as large as the experimental systematic errors and of the same size as the current statistical uncertainty . to make full use of the coming lhc data ,",
    "the theoretical uncertainty should thus be reduced significantly .",
    "there has been a lot of progress in the theoretical description of the higgs - boson production rate with a jet veto over the past year , starting with the work @xcite , where it was shown that the sudakov logarithms associated with the jet veto can be resummed at next - to - leading logarithmic ( nll ) order .",
    "subsequently , we have derived an all - order factorization theorem @xcite using soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) @xcite , which allows for resummation to any desired accuracy , given the necessary perturbative input .",
    "we have also explicitly carried out the resummation at nnll order .",
    "one of the necessary ingredients at this level of accuracy is the two - loop coefficient @xmath15 of the so - called collinear anomaly @xcite , which we had extracted from partial nnll results of @xcite under the assumption that these results remained valid in the limit where the jet - radius parameter @xmath1 is taken to infinity .",
    "it was subsequently shown by banfi et al .  that this assumption does not hold @xcite .",
    "the limits @xmath16 and @xmath17 do not commute , and taking the large-@xmath1 limit naively one misses an @xmath1-independent term in @xmath15 .",
    "after correcting the value of the two - loop coefficient accordingly , there is full agreement between the nnll results presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the validity of factorization formula put forward in @xcite was questioned by the authors of @xcite , who claimed that this formula breaks down unless the jet radius @xmath1 is assumed to be parametrically small , such that @xmath18 . however , for small @xmath1 the perturbative corrections to the cross section are enhanced by logarithms of the jet radius , and these logarithms can not be resummed by means of the factorization formula obtained in @xcite .",
    "reference @xcite concluded that one is `` stuck between a rock and a hard place '' , because one would either face factorization - breaking corrections or large unresummed logarithms of @xmath1 .",
    "however , immediately after the paper @xcite appeared a nnll resummation formula was published in @xcite , and it was verified numerically that it correctly predicts the relevant logarithms up to @xmath19 , even for @xmath20 . to nnll accuracy , our factorization formula precisely matches the result of @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is three - fold .",
    "first , we will compute the two - loop anomaly coefficient @xmath15 directly within the scet framework .",
    "we find complete agreement with the qcd result of @xcite , which demonstrates explicitly and analytically that our factorization formula , which does not include soft - collinear mixing terms , is correct up to nnll order .",
    "we provide a completely analytic result for the expansion of the two - loop anomaly coefficient in @xmath1 , whose @xmath1-independent piece was only obtained in numerical form in previous papers @xcite .",
    "secondly , we will show that the soft - collinear mixing contributions obtained in @xcite are absent if one ensures that the computation is done in such a way that there is no double counting among the different momentum regions in the effective theory .",
    "this double counting is avoided from the beginning if loop and phase - space integrals in the effective theory are properly expanded in the different momentum regions .",
    "if the jet measure is left unexpanded , as was done in @xcite , then non - zero soft - collinear mixing contributions can arise in individual integrals , but they cancel if the necessary subtractions are performed to remove the soft - collinear overlap regions from the integrals .",
    "we discuss these issues in detail , give arguments that factorization breaking will also not arise at higher logarithmic accuracy , and conclude that all the available evidence indicates that the factorization theorem proposed in @xcite is valid to all orders .",
    "thirdly , we present an updated and improved phenomenological analysis of the higgs - boson production cross section with a jet veto . since the two - loop anomaly coefficient turns out to be numerically large for the values of @xmath1 used by the experimental collaborations , the predictions obtained at nnll order still suffer from significant scale uncertainties .",
    "we show that all the ingredients required to increase the accuracy to n@xmath4ll order are either already known or can be extracted numerically , except for the three - loop anomaly coefficient and the four - loop cusp anomalous dimension .",
    "we estimate the effect of these missing coefficients and find that they only have a small numerical impact on the results .",
    "we thus obtain predictions with n@xmath4ll@xmath21 accuracy , where the subscript `` p '' ( for `` partial '' ) indicates that two of the ingredients for a complete n@xmath4ll calculation are yet unknown .",
    "we also include power - suppressed terms by matching our results to the nnlo fixed - order cross section , finding that these power corrections are numerically small .",
    "this indicates that the expansion about small @xmath13 is well behaved at the experimentally relevant values of the jet - veto scale .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : we first review in section  [ sec:2 ] the factorization theorem for the cross section with a jet veto and collect the necessary perturbative ingredients . in section  [ sec : multipole ] , we then discuss the clustering of particles in different momentum regions and show that factorization - breaking terms are absent . after this general discussion , we present the explicit calculation of the two - loop anomaly coefficient @xmath15 in section  [ sec:2loop ] . the numerical extraction of the two - loop beam functions and the fixed - order matching are discussed in section  [ sec : beamfuns ] . with these ingredients at hand , we present in section  [ sec : numerics ] our numerical results for the jet - veto cross section for higgs production at the lhc .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section  [ sec : concl ] . in the appendix",
    ", we give some details on the analytic calculation of the two - loop anomaly coefficient as an expansion in the jet - radius parameter @xmath1 .",
    "using arguments based on scet , we have shown in @xcite that the higgs - boson production cross section defined with a jet veto @xmath22 can be factorized , to all orders in perturbation theory and at leading power in the small ratio @xmath2 , in a way that separates the short - distance scales @xmath23 and @xmath24 from the scale @xmath13 of the jet veto .",
    "we work with the usual class of sequential recombination jet algorithms @xcite , with distance measure @xmath25 where @xmath26 corresponds to the @xmath27 algorithm @xcite , @xmath28 to the cambridge - aachen algorithm @xcite , and @xmath29 to the anti-@xmath27 algorithm @xcite .",
    "the two particles with the smallest distance are combined into a new `` particle '' , whose momentum is the sum of the momenta of the parent particles . if the smallest distance is @xmath30 , then particle @xmath31 is considered a jet and removed from the list .",
    "the procedure is iterated until all particles are grouped into jets , i.e. , the algorithm is inclusive . in the following",
    ", the jet - radius parameter is assumed to obey the inequalities @xmath32 and we work in the limit where @xmath33 is a small expansion parameter",
    ". then these inequalities are satisfied as long as @xmath1 is treated as an @xmath34 number , independent of @xmath35",
    ". for too small values of @xmath1 ( meaning @xmath36 or smaller ) , large logarithms @xmath37 arise , which would require a special treatment .",
    "these `` clustering logarithms '' have a complicated structure in higher orders @xcite , and it is currently not understood how to resum them . for too large @xmath1",
    "( meaning @xmath38 or larger ) , on the other hand , the factorization formula breaks down .",
    "the factorization formula is obtained by factorizing the contributions of hard , collinear , anti - collinear , and soft modes in scet . denoting by @xmath39 the rapidity of the higgs boson in the proton - proton center - of - mass frame ,",
    "one first derives the preliminary result @xmath40_{q^2=m_h^2 } , \\ ] ] where @xmath41 and @xmath42 the wilson coefficient @xmath43 arises when one approximates the fermion - loop contribution to the gluon fusion amplitude by an effective , local @xmath44 operator , as is routinely done in calculations of the higgs - boson production amplitude .",
    "the hard matching coefficient @xmath45 appears when the scalar two - gluon operator is matched onto a corresponding operator in scet @xcite .",
    "both coefficients are known to three - loop order in perturbation theory , but for our purposes we only need the two - loop expressions derived in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the resulting expressions can also be found in eqs .",
    "( 12 ) and ( 17 ) of @xcite .",
    "the emissions of ( anti-)collinear and soft gluons , which are then grouped into jets according to the jet algorithm , are accounted for by the beam functions @xmath46 , @xmath47 and the soft function @xmath48 in the factorization theorem ( [ dsigdy ] ) .",
    "besides the veto scale , these functions also depend on the jet definition and in particular on the jet - radius parameter @xmath1 .",
    "this dependence is suppressed in our notation .",
    "the collinear matrix element relevant for higgs production reads @xcite @xmath49     & \\quad\\times \\langle p(p)|\\,{\\cal a}_{c\\perp}^{\\mu , a}(t\\bar n)\\,|x_c\\rangle\\ ,      \\langle x_c|\\,{\\cal a}_{c\\perp\\mu}^a(0)\\,|p(p)\\rangle \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 denotes the gauge - invariant collinear gluon field in scet .",
    "the matrix element in the second line is exactly the same as that entering the definition of the standard parton distribution function ( pdf ) for the gluon .",
    "the only difference is that the sum over intermediate states in ( [ collfun ] ) is constrained by the jet veto , whose effect is encoded in a `` measurement function '' @xmath51 , which depends on the momenta @xmath52 of the particles in the final state .",
    "likewise , the soft function is defined as @xmath53 with @xmath54 .",
    "it involves wilson lines of soft gluon fields in the adjoint representation , integrated along the beam directions @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "like in the case of the transverse - position dependent pdfs studied in @xcite , the presence of a measurement function probing parton transverse momenta leads to additional light - cone ( or rapidity ) divergences , which are not regularized in dimensional regularization .",
    "the sums over collinear states @xmath57 in ( [ collfun ] ) and soft states @xmath58 in ( [ softfun ] ) are therefore regularized analytically . to this end",
    ", we use the phase - space regularization prescription of @xcite , which amounts to replacing the usual phase - space measure by @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the regularization softens the light - cone singularities arising in the evaluation of the matrix elements .",
    "it introduces a new scale @xmath62 , which plays an analogous role to the scale @xmath63 entering in dimensional regularization .",
    "once the light - cone singularities in the ( anti-)collinear and soft functions have been regularized , they show up as poles in the analytic regulator @xmath64 , which cancel in the product of the three matrix elements in ( [ dsigdy ] ) .",
    "however , after the cancellation large logarithms of the scale ratio @xmath65 arise , which need to be resummed to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "this effect has been called the `` collinear factorization anomaly '' @xcite .",
    "the resummation of the anomalous logarithms can be accomplished by means of solving simple differential equations , which express the fact that the product of the three functions must be regularization independent @xcite .",

    "all objects in the factorization formula ( [ sigfinal ] ) are defined in a rg - invariant way , i.e.  they are formally independent of the factorization scale @xmath63 .",
    "as is common practice , we can use the residual @xmath63 dependence arising when the expressions ( [ pdfmatch ] ) and ( [ hbardef ] ) are evaluated at some fixed order in perturbation theory as an indicator of the remaining perturbative uncertainties .",
    "this can be done for each of these objects separately , not just for the total cross section .",
    "we also note that the expression for the hard function becomes particularly simple if one adopts the default scale choice @xmath109 on the right - hand side of ( [ hbardef ] ) . in this case @xmath110",
    "we now analyze the factorization properties of the jet - veto cross section using the formalism of scet , in which highly energetic particles aligned with the colliding protons are described in terms of collinear and anti - collinear quark and gluon fields , and soft particles emitted from the beam jets are described in terms of soft fields .",
    "the effective theory implements an expansion of scattering amplitudes in powers of the small parameter @xmath111 , where the jet veto sets the characteristic size of all transverse momenta in the process .",
    "we introduce two light - like reference vectors @xmath112 and @xmath113 ( satisfying @xmath114 ) parallel to the beam axis and decompose all 4-vectors in the light - cone basis spanned by these vectors , @xmath115 the different types of modes relevant to our discussion are characterized by the scalings of their momenta @xmath116 with powers of @xmath35 , namely @xmath117 for collinear particles , @xmath118 for anti - collinear particles , and @xmath119 for soft particles .",
    "hence , the particles in these three categories have transverse momenta of order the jet veto , but very different rapidities .",
    "the scaling of these modes is displayed graphically in figure  [ fig : regions ] .",
    "in addition , the cross section receives contributions from the hard momentum region @xmath120 , where we do not distinguish between @xmath24 and @xmath23 .",
    "these corrections are purely virtual and are integrated out in the construction of the effective theory .",
    "one may also worry about the contributions from modes with smaller virtualities , @xmath121 .",
    "for example , an on - shell soft mode , which accidentally is closely aligned with the beam axis , would have momentum scaling @xmath122 .",
    "this mode has a rapidity lying in between that of collinear and soft modes .",
    "indeed , it may also be regarded as a collinear mode whose minus component is accidentally small .",
    "the important point is that , because of their small transverse momenta , such modes play no role for the total transverse momentum of a jet .",
    "therefore , an arbitrary number of them can be emitted , and their effect cancels out in the factorization theorem .",
    "this is in analogy with the cancellation of ultrasoft modes in the factorization theorem for the drell - yan cross section at small transverse momentum  @xcite .",

    "the figure indicates the scaling of the @xmath123 and @xmath124 components of soft ( @xmath128 ) , collinear ( @xmath129 ) , anti - collinear ( @xmath130 ) , and hard ( @xmath131 ) contributions . the hyperbola corresponds to @xmath132 .",
    "the red hatching shows the soft - collinear overlap regions.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    as explained in @xcite , the jet clustering algorithm does not group particles with different momentum scalings ( collinear , anti - collinear , or soft ) into the same jet .",
    "the reason is that , generically , the rapidity difference between two such particles are such that @xmath133 , which by assumption is much larger than @xmath1 , see ( [ r1 ] ) . as a consequence , in the jet algorithm",
    "( [ algo ] ) the distance measure @xmath134 for two such particles is always larger than the minimum of @xmath30 and @xmath135 .",
    "since the soft and ( anti-)collinear modes have the same virtuality , they live along the hyperbola in the @xmath136 plane shown in figure [ fig : regions ] , and their precise separation along this hyperbola is to some extent arbitrary .",
    "the fact that these modes differ by large rapidities gives rise to large logarithms , which are accounted for by the collinear anomaly .",
    "in complete analogy with the construction of the scet lagrangian , where based on the _ generic _ scalings of the fields one does not include soft - collinear interaction terms , it is unnecessary to consider the degenerate case where a collinear and a soft mode near the boundary are clustered into a single jet .",
    "since there are no enhancements of the cross section in these power - suppressed phase - space regions , boundary effects do not contribute at leading power . only in corners of the phase space , e.g.  when a soft emission becomes collinear to the beam , soft and collinear radiation can be clustered into the same jet . however , since the cross section does not exhibit additional singularities in the corresponding limit , such configurations only give rise to power - suppressed contributions .    the argument",
    "just presented has been challenged in @xcite , where it was argued that the clustering of soft and collinear modes near the boundary of phase space that separates them in rapidity does give rise to leading - order contributions to the cross section starting at nnll order , unless the jet - radius parameter @xmath1 is taken to be parametrically much smaller than  1 .",
    "if this was true , then there would be no region in parameter space where our factorization theorem ( [ sigfinal ] ) would be useful , since for parametrically small values of @xmath1 it does not accomplish the resummation of @xmath37 terms .",
    "the argument presented in @xcite was backed up by a calculation of a particular soft - collinear clustering contribution , which was found to be non - zero and provided a leading - power contribution to the cross section proportional to @xmath137 and @xmath138 , hence the claim that these contributions are suppressed only for parametrically small @xmath1 .",
    "we will now demonstrate in detail that these findings are not in conflict with our factorization formula .",
    "scet is based on the method of regions .",
    "loop and phase - space integrations are split into different momentum regions in a systematic manner dictated by the structure of the effective lagrangian .",
    "one could separate the different regions using cutoffs , as indicated graphically in figure  [ fig : regions ] , but this is impractical because it would spoil gauge invariance in the individual sectors of the effective theory .",
    "instead , one uses dimensional regularization to handle the appearing singularities .",
    "it is then crucially important to perform the calculation of scet diagrams using a multipole expansion , which expands out components of particle momenta ( or position vectors ) that are parametrically suppressed with respect to the leading ones in a given interaction or propagator @xcite .",
    "only if this is done consistently , there is no double counting of momentum configurations .",
    "the reason is that , once we consider the contribution from a certain momentum region to an integral , any expansion of the integrand around another limit will leave us with a scaleless integral , which is zero in dimensional ( or , more generally , analytic ) regularization . in the present case ,",
    "it is important that one performs the multipole expansion not only for the integrands of loop or phase - space integrals , but also for the measurement functions @xmath51 in the definitions ( [ collfun ] ) and ( [ softfun ] ) .",
    "if one does not perform the multipole expansion consistently , then there arise contributions from the double counting of overlapping momentum regions , which must be subtracted by hand in order to obtain the correct result . in the scet community these subtraction terms",
    "are referred to as `` zero - bin subtractions '' @xcite .",
    "the problem with the argument presented in @xcite is that the soft - collinear clustering contribution was calculated _ without _ performing the multipole expansion , but the relevant zero - bin subtractions were not evaluated .",
    "we will argue that these zero - bin subtractions exactly cancel the soft - collinear clustering term , so that one recovers the same result as before .",
    "when the multipole expansion is performed consistently , the contributions in which different modes are clustered by the jet algorithm are simply zero .",
    "we will now illustrate these statements with the help of a simple example , which demonstrates our point without involving the technical complexities of the real calculation . in section  [ sec:2loop ]",
    ", we will perform the calculation of the two - loop anomaly coefficient @xmath15 in the context of scet , considering only the contributions of two collinear or two soft emissions , in accordance with our factorization formula ( [ dsigdy ] ) , according to which the jet veto must be applied separately in each sector of scet .",
    "the fact that in this way we reproduce the result extracted from @xcite proves that there are no missing contributions at this order .",
    "we thus do not confirm the statement made in @xcite that soft - collinear mixing terms contribute to the cross section at @xmath139 .",
    "moreover , since our arguments are completely general and not tied to a particular order in the perturbative expansion , they support our claim that the factorization formula ( [ sigfinal ] ) remains valid also in higher orders in perturbation theory .",
    "consider the following simple rapidity integral with integrand 1 and the constraint that two particles with rapidities @xmath140 and @xmath39 are clustered into one jet : @xmath141 here @xmath142 is the fixed rapidity of a collinear particle , and we assume that @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath143-function plays the role of the measurement function @xmath51 in the definitions ( [ collfun ] ) and ( [ softfun ] ) .",
    "even though this integral is extremely simple , it captures the main features of the integrals we will encounter in the computation of the @xmath144 term in section  [ sec : cf2 ] , since the relevant part of the amplitude for this color structure only depends on the transverse momentum .",
    "the only difference to the trivial example integral ( [ simpex ] ) is that one also integrates over the rapidity of the second emission and the azimuthal angles , which then also enter the @xmath143-function constraint . in the context of scet",
    "we should evaluate the integral as a sum over contributions from different momentum regions . in each region",
    "we must multipole expand the argument of the @xmath143-function according to the rules of the effective theory .",
    "for the purposes of our discussion we will consider for the moment only the contributions from collinear and soft partons ; as we discuss below , adding the anti - collinear region would not change the argument .",
    "a collinear particle has momentum scaling @xmath145 . in the collinear region",
    "both rapidities scale the same , @xmath146 , but their difference is @xmath34 . there is thus nothing to expand in the argument of the @xmath143-function , and we get @xmath147 for the collinear - collinear clustering term .",
    "a soft particle has momentum scaling @xmath148 and hence @xmath149 .",
    "it follows that in the argument of the @xmath143-function @xmath150 is parametrically larger than @xmath151 .",
    "we must therefore perform the multipole expansion @xmath152 the higher - order terms in the expansion will contain derivatives of @xmath153-functions , but because the arguments are always non - zero the entire expression on the right - hand side just vanishes .    at this point",
    "one may worry about double counting , since in the collinear - collinear contribution we have also integrated over the region where the collinear particle becomes soft .",
    "one should therefore subtract the contribution from the soft - collinear overlap region ( the `` zero bin '' ) , which otherwise would be counted twice .",
    "however , after the multipole expansion this overlap contribution vanishes , @xmath154 , for the same reason that the soft - collinear contribution vanishes .",
    "alternatively , one could evaluate the contributions from the two regions without performing the multipole expansion .",
    "then obviously both regions yield the same contribution , @xmath155 .",
    "but now the double - counted soft - collinear overlap contribution is also non - zero , and indeed @xmath156 is equal to the soft - collinear contribution .",
    "the final result is @xmath157 , as it should be . in analogy with the findings of @xcite",
    "the soft - collinear clustering term is non - zero in this case , but its contribution is precisely cancelled by the zero - bin subtraction .",
    "when also the anti - collinear region is included , we still only need to compute the contribution @xmath158 if the multipole expansion is performed consistently , but when working with subtractions the procedure gets more complicated .",
    "the general expression for three momentum regions reads @xmath159 the last term @xmath160 describes the double overlap region , where the momentum can simultaneously be part of any region .",
    "it is obtained by expanding the integrand in the limit where the momentum scales as @xmath161 .",
    "it has to be added back , since the other three subtractions would remove this region from the integral .",
    "the general systematics of subtractions was studied in detail in @xcite , as a step towards a proof of the method of regions . in our simple example ,",
    "all of the above contributions are equal to the original integral @xmath162 . since the momenta in the double overlap region and in the @xmath163 contribution scale in the same way , the last two terms in ( [ subtr ] ) are identical for any given integral , and the general expression simplifies to @xmath164 while useful to map the integrals in dimensional regularization onto standard integrals , the subtraction procedure is extremely cumbersome in practice .",
    "for the two - emission case , for example , one would start off with 25 momentum configurations , since each of the two momenta can be in any of the regions or overlap regions in ( [ subtrsimp ] ) .",
    "in addition to the proliferation of regions , another drawback of the subtraction method is fact that the integrals are no longer homogenous in the expansion parameter @xmath35 , so that in general one will need to reexpand the final result in @xmath35 after integrating .",
    "it may appear strange at first sight that we had to expand the argument of the @xmath143-function in ( [ simpex ] ) in powers of @xmath165 , not in powers of @xmath35 .",
    "this distinction is however meaningless . instead of ( [ thetaexp ] ) we may equally well write @xmath166 , where @xmath167 for a soft particle .",
    "the multipole expansion is now an expansion in powers of @xmath35 .",
    "indeed , one can always rewrite the rapidity integrals in terms of integrals over components of light - cone momenta . for example , denoting the collinear reference momentum by @xmath168 and the soft momentum by @xmath169 , we have @xmath170 and @xmath171 , and hence the phase - space constraint can be rewritten in the form @xmath172 in the last step we have indicated the scalings of the various soft and collinear momentum components . neglecting higher - order terms in @xmath35 , we obtain @xmath173 which vanishes , since each light - cone component of an on - shell momentum is positive .",
    "we can further think of the @xmath143-functions of momentum components as the discontinuities of some propagators .",
    "this clearly shows that the multipole expansion in ( [ thetaexp ] ) is not different from multipole expansions of propagators in ordinary scet loop or phase - space integrals , and it makes it clear that power - suppressed terms , which are expanded out , are governed by powers of @xmath35 , not powers of @xmath174 .",
    "we finish this section with an important remark .",
    "the structure of the first @xmath143-function in ( [ eq : phasespace ] ) suggests that some of the power - suppressed terms may be accompanied by a factor @xmath175 . because we treat @xmath1 as an @xmath34 parameter",
    ", also @xmath175 is _ not _ a parametrically large quantity , so even if such terms exist , their presence would not upset the structure of the factorization formula ( [ sigfinal ] ) .",
    "the question of the numerical size of power - suppressed corrections must be separated from the issue of parametrically enhanced corrections .",
    "the outcome of our discussion is that , for @xmath3 , there are _ no contributions _ to the cross section arising from soft - collinear clustering terms , which would upset the factorization formula . in our framework",
    "all soft contributions are purely scaleless . in physical terms",
    ", this means that the soft contributions can effectively be absorbed into the ( anti-)collinear fields .",
    "the structure of relation ( [ colanom ] ) implies that this is indeed possible .",
    "the same happens for the transverse - momentum spectrum of electroweak bosons @xcite , and also in all scet@xmath176 applications where a separate mode with @xmath148 scaling is not needed to describe the physics .",
    "nevertheless , there are power - corrections to our factorization formula from subleading terms in the effective lagrangian and subleading scet operators . in section  [ sec : numerics ] we will study their numerical impact by matching our results to the cross section computed in fixed - order perturbation theory . we will find that even for @xmath177 the power corrections remain small ; indeed , we will not find any numerical evidence for the existence of @xmath175-enhanced power corrections .",
    "we now turn to the computation of the two - loop anomaly exponent @xmath15 in ( [ fhexpansions ] ) . according to the factorization formula ( [ sigfinal ] ) , this quantity can be obtained from a perturbative computation of the collinear and soft matrix elements defined in ( [ collfun ] ) and ( [ softfun ] ) . instead of the beam function @xmath178 for a gluon",
    ", we will in the following consider the analogous function for a collinear quark , defined as @xmath179 this function would appear in the calculation of the jet - veto cross section for a quark - initiated process such as @xmath180-boson production at the lhc .",
    "as we will explain below , the result for @xmath15 relevant for higgs production can be obtained from the corresponding coefficient for @xmath180 production by replacing @xmath181 , but distinguishing the two color factors will make it easier to organize the calculation .",
    "the gauge - invariant gluon and quark fields in the matrix elements in ( [ collfun ] ) and ( [ collfunquark ] ) are related to the usual qcd fields by @xcite @xmath182 \\ , , \\qquad     \\chi_c(x ) = \\frac{n\\!\\!\\!/\\bar n\\!\\!\\!/}{4}\\,w^\\dagger(x)\\,\\psi(x ) \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath183 is a straight wilson line along the @xmath56 direction from @xmath184 to @xmath185 .",
    "we use the standard qcd lagrangian to evaluate the collinear matrix element in ( [ collfunquark ] ) , since the collinear scet lagrangian is equivalent to it ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",

    "in addition , we also need to calculate the soft function defined in ( [ softfun ] ) , which involves products of soft wilson lines along the two beam directions . for the higgs case , these are wilson lines in the adjoint representation , while the fundamental representation is relevant for the case of @xmath180-boson production .",
    "the normalization factor becomes @xmath187 in the latter case , such that @xmath69 at lowest order in perturbation theory . in the analytic regularization scheme based on the prescription ( [ analytreg ] ) ,",
    "the soft function is given by scaleless integrals of the type @xmath188 which vanish by definition .",
    "the reason is that the integral over the total rapidity @xmath189 of the emitted soft gluons is not constrained by the jet veto .",
    "it follows that @xmath69 to all orders in this regularization scheme . in principle , it is thus sufficient to evaluate the collinear functions @xmath190 and @xmath191 , and since the divergences in the analytic regulator must cancel in the product of these functions , calculating the left- or right - collinear function would be sufficient in practice .    in our calculation",
    "we will , however , adopt a different strategy .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that one obtains a non - zero soft function if one imposes different jet vetoes for the left- and right - moving particles .",
    "the anomalous large logarithms in the soft function are then tied , via the anomaly equations , to those in the collinear beam functions . extracting the coefficient @xmath15 from the soft function offers the advantage that the relevant wilson - line diagrams are simpler to compute than the loop diagrams for the collinear functions . instead of imposing different jet vetoes for left- and right - moving particles",
    ", we can generate a non - trivial soft function by using different analytic regulators for them . to this end",
    ", we generalize the regularization prescription in ( [ analytreg ] ) by replacing @xmath192 after the multipole expansion , the collinear function only involves the regulator @xmath82 , while the anti - collinear function is regularized by @xmath64 .",
    "the cancellation of divergences between the soft and ( anti-)collinear functions then proceeds in the way shown schematically in table  [ table : corrmat ] . because of the structure of the cancellations , the computation of the divergence of a single function is again sufficient , and with the regulator ( [ splitreg ] ) we can work with the soft instead of the ( anti-)collinear functions .",
    "for convenience , we will perform the extraction of the color structures @xmath193 and @xmath194 of the anomaly coefficient @xmath15 from the computation of the soft function using the split regulator ( [ splitreg ] ) , while we will extract the @xmath144 part from the collinear functions with the original form ( [ analytreg ] ) of the regulator .",
    ".[table : corrmat ] structure of the divergences of two - emission diagrams arising when one uses the regulator ( [ splitreg ] ) , which distinguishes left- and right - moving particles .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     numerical results for the jet - veto cross section and efficiency are given in table  [ tab : numbers ] for two different values of @xmath1 .",
    "in addition to the uncertainties shown in the table , one has to account for the pdf and @xmath196 errors .",
    "the combined relative uncertainty due to these input parameters is very similar to that obtained for the total cross section .",
    "the table shows that it would be beneficial to increase the jet radius compared to the presently used values @xmath197 . on the experimental side",
    ", this would increase the sensitivity to the underlying event and pile - up , but these effects could be mitigated by resorting to techniques such as the one proposed in @xcite .",
    "using methods from effective field theory , we have obtained precise predictions for the higgs - boson production cross section in the presence of a jet veto , in which both sudakov logarithms of the form @xmath0 arising due to the veto as well as the large virtual corrections affecting also the total cross section are resummed in a systematic way . to demonstrate the validity of the factorization formula ( [ sigfinal ] ) for the cross section , which was first derived in @xcite , we have determined all its ingredients at two - loop order and have increased the logarithmic accuracy of the resummation to ( partial ) n@xmath4ll order . in particular , we have computed the two - loop anomaly coefficient @xmath15 and have obtained a fully analytic expression for its series expansion valid for @xmath198 , including the constant term , which previously was only known in numerical form .",
    "our result agrees with the expression obtained in @xcite through a calculation in qcd .",
    "contrary to claims in the literature @xcite , we find that even for @xmath3 soft - collinear mixing contributions , which would break factorization , are absent .",
    "this establishes factorization at nnll accuracy .",
    "in addition to the explicit two - loop calculation , we have discussed in detail why such soft - collinear mixing terms are absent also in higher orders of the perturbative expansion . that they do not arise becomes manifest if the multipole expansion in the effective theory is properly implemented , i.e. , if power - suppressed terms are consistently expanded away at the integrand level .",
    "since scet does not include hard cutoffs to separate the soft and collinear momentum regions , this multipole expansion is necessary in order to avoid double counting of certain momentum configurations . if , as in @xcite , the multipole expansion is only performed at the lagrangian level , but not for the measurement function which defines the observable , then soft - collinear mixing terms arise in the overlap of the soft and collinear regions .",
    "however , we have shown that they cancel against the contribution from the overlap region .",
    "our analysis thus reinforces the validity of the factorization theorem proposed in @xcite .",
    "we have extended the phenomenological analysis of the higgs - boson production cross section with a jet veto to n@xmath4ll@xmath21 accuracy , where the subscript `` p '' stands for `` partial '' and indicates that two perturbative coefficients  the four - loop cusp anomalous dimension and the three - loop coefficient of the collinear anomaly  are currently still missing to complete the resummation at this order . the motivation for going beyond nnll order is that the two - loop anomaly coefficient @xmath15 turns out to be numerically quite large .",
    "for example , at @xmath199 it is almost six times larger than the corresponding coefficient arising in the resummation formula for the transverse - momentum spectrum of the higgs boson .",
    "this gives rise to a significant scale uncertainty of the nnll result .",
    "furthermore , for small values of the jet - radius parameter @xmath1 , the scale variation can not be trusted as an estimator of the effect of higher - order corrections .",
    "this is because the three - loop coefficient @xmath97 is enhanced by two powers of @xmath200 , while the scale - dependent pieces at two - loop order involve at most a single logarithm of @xmath1 . in view of this fact",
    ", we have estimated the impact of the three - loop coefficient and find that it is relatively small , even with a generous estimate for the coefficient of the double - logarithmic term .",
    "the numerical impact of the other missing ingredient , the four - loop cusp anomalous dimension , is negligibly small .",
    "the most important contribution at n@xmath4ll order arises from the two - loop beam functions , which we have extracted numerically using the fixed - order code hnnlo . as for the two - loop anomaly coefficient , we find that the two - loop perturbative corrections to the beam functions are rather large , especially in the region of small @xmath1 , where they are logarithmically enhanced . for @xmath201 ,",
    "the two - loop corrections are larger than estimated by the one - loop scale variation , and also the scale uncertainty of the two - loop beam functions is larger than at one - loop order .",
    "it constitutes the main uncertainty of our final results for the cross section . on the other hand , since the leading @xmath200-dependent corrections to both the exponent of the collinear anomaly and the beam functions are included in our n@xmath4ll@xmath21+nnlo results , we expect that yet higher - order corrections would turn out to be small",
    ". nevertheless , it would be interesting and important to compute the @xmath200-enhanced terms at three - loop order ( and perhaps even beyond ) .",
    "we believe that it should be possible to calculate the leading logarithmic part of the three - loop anomaly coefficient @xmath97 , which would reduce the uncertainty of our predictions especially at low values of @xmath1 .",
    "in addition to performing the resummation of the jet - veto cross section at leading power in @xmath2 , we have matched our resummed results to the full fixed - order expression for the cross section computed at nnlo , which has allowed us to also include power - suppressed terms .",
    "the size of these power corrections serves as an important check of the quality of the expansion in the small ratio @xmath2 , which is the basis for our factorization formula .",
    "numerically , the power corrections turn out to be quite small for the relevant values of @xmath13 .",
    "importantly , we find no evidence for a growth of the power corrections with increasing @xmath1 . a crucial element of our analysis is that we have separated different sources of theoretical uncertainties .",
    "this avoids accidental cancellations and furthermore allows us to investigate the uncertainty associated with each source individually . in our final results ,",
    "we have added in quadrature the uncertainties in the hard function ( which contains the resummation of all large logarithms ) , the beam functions , and the power corrections to the cross section .",
    "our results significantly improve the accuracy of the higgs - boson production cross section with a jet veto .",
    "detailed numerical predictions can be found in table  [ tab : numbers ] .",
    "it would be interesting to perform the resummation of large logarithms also for the @xmath9 production cross section , which is the main background to the @xmath202 signal in the presence of a jet veto .",
    "the @xmath9 cross section is furthermore used to search for anomalous gauge couplings , and also in this case it is necessary to impose a jet veto . likewise",
    ", sudakov logarithms should also be resummed for the cross sections for higgs production in association with one or two tagged jets .",
    "the resummation is more challenging in the higher jet bins , due to the presence of non - global logarithms .",
