    "correspondence analysis ( ca ) , developed by benzcri ( 1973 ) since 1960s , as a statistical method for different kinds of datasets , in particular for contingency tables , is embedded both in theory and in practice .",
    "the theory is based on the chi - square distance between the profiles ; parallel to this beautiful theory , the practice is entrenched in the joint interpretation of the graphical displays based on the euclidean geometry . seeing",
    "this extreme fondness of the use and interpretation of the maps by the users of ca , nishisato ( 1998 ) suggested the replacement of the adage seeing is believing  with graphing is believing  and stressed the importance of interpretable graphs .",
    "additionally , we recall the often cited quip a picture is worth a thousand words , and via geometricinterpretation of maps ca offers much to the analysis of complex multivariate data sets .",
    "so the philosophical question asked by schlick ( 2000 , part 5 ) `` theory and observation : is seeing believing ? ''",
    "is quite relevant here in the context of data analysis by ca .",
    "it is well known that , ca is very sensitive to some particularities of a data set ; further , how to identify and handle these is an open unresolved problem . here , we enumerate three under the umbrella of sparse contingency tables :",
    "first , rao ( 1995 ) stressed the influence of rare observations ( rows or columns that have relatively small marginal weights compared to others ) and proposed an alternative to ca based on hellinger distance ( a square - root transformation of counts ) .",
    "second , greenacre ( 2013 ) highlighted the adverse influence of a zero - block structure in a data set and suggested its suppression from analysis .",
    "similar to greenacre s observation , earlier novak and bar - hen ( 2005 ) observed that a zero - block structure in a contingency table disturbs ca results , but argued against the suppression of the zero - block .",
    "third , often few relatively high - valued cells have detrimental effect on the ca outputs by emphasizing some aspects of the data , even though apparently the interpretation of the dimensions seems meaningful to the researchers .",
    "our approach in this paper is to highlight the above mentioned points by comparing the maps obtained by ca with the maps obtained by taxicab correspondence analysis ( tca ) , where tca is a l@xmath2 variant of ca .",
    "if the projections of view of both maps are quite different , we refer to this phenomenon as parallax . in astronomy",
    ", parallax means the apparent change in the position of an object as seen from two different points . in our case",
    "the two different points correspond to the two different geometries , euclidean ( l@xmath1 ) and taxicab ( l@xmath0 ) .",
    "the existence of a parallax will highlight the important , but hidden , role of the underlying geometry in the interpretation of the maps obtained in multivariate data analysis .",
    "we emphasize the following fact based on our experience : only by comparing ca and tca graphical displays , we are able to see the existence of the phenomenon of parallax .    this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we introduce notation by presenting a brief comparison of ca and tca with further comments ; section 3 presents the analysis of three data sets to highlight the absence or the presence of the parallax phenomenon . and we conclude in section 4",
    ".    the theory of ca can be found , among others , in benzcri ( 1973 , 1992 ) , greenacre ( 1984 ) , gifi ( 1990 ) , le roux and rouanet ( 2004 ) , murtagh ( 2005 ) , and nishisato ( 2007 ) ; the recent book , authored by beh and lombardi ( 2014 ) , presents a panoramic review of ca and related methods .",
    "since 2006 , choulakian and coauthors have studied mathematical properties of tca applied to many kinds of non - negative data ; in particular , tca of contingency tables and their comparison with ca are studied in the following papers : choulakian ( 2006 ) , choulakian et al .",

    ", we suggest the analysis of a data set by both methods ca and tca : like a cubist painting where an object is painted from different angles , sometimes the views are similar ( no parallax ) , and at other times not similar ( there is a parallax ) .",
    "in particular for sparse contingency tables , in case there is a parallax , the comparison may reveal : either , ca and tca complement and enrich each other as shown in the analysis of the second data set ; or , the researcher uses his subjective knowledge to choose between the two methods , as shown by the analysis of the third data set .",

    "<S> visualization and interpretation of contingency tables by correspondence analysis ( ca ) , as developed by benzcri , has a rich structure based on euclidean geometry . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is a well established fact that , often ca is very sensitive to sparse contingency tables , where we caracterize sparsity as the existence of relatively high - valued counts , rare observations discussed by rao ( 1995 ) , and zero - block structure emphasized by novak and bar - hen ( 2005 ) and greenacre ( 2013 ) . in this paper , we aim to emphasize the important roles played by l@xmath0 and l@xmath1 geometries . </S>",
    "<S> this will be done by comparing the maps obtained by ca with the maps obtained by taxicab correspondence analysis ( tca ) , where tca is a robust l@xmath0 variant of correspondence analysis . </S>",
    "<S> if the projections of view of both maps are quite different , we refer to this phenomenon as parallax . in astronomy </S>",
    "<S> , parallax means the apparent change in the position of an object as seen from two different points . in our case </S>",
    "<S> the two different points correspond to the two different geometries , euclidean and taxicab . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of a parallax highlights the important , but hidden , role of the underlying geometry in the interpretation of the maps obtained in multivariate data analysis . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize the following fact : only by comparing ca and tca graphical displays , we are able to reveal the phenomenon of parallax . </S>",
    "<S> examples are provided .    </S>",
