    "they can also be investigated in ultra - cold atoms trapped in honeycomb optical lattices as the bosonic tight binding model is analogous to that of haldane model , which has been realized experimentally in optical fermionic lattice @xcite .    in 3d quantum magnets ,",

    "in 2d quantum spin magnetic materials , non - degenerate band - touching points or dirac points require at least two energy branches of the magnon excitations . therefore , ordered quantum magnets that can be treated with one sublattice are devoid of dirac points .",
