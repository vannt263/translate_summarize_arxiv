    "the problem of decentralized sequential detection with data fusion dates back to the 1980s with the works of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we are interested in the problem of quickest detection in an @xmath0-sensor network in which the information available is distributed and decentralized , a problem introduced in @xcite .",
    "we consider the situation in which the onset of a signal can occur at different times in the @xmath0 sensors , that is the change points can be different for each of the @xmath0 sensors .",
    "we assume that each sensor runs a cumulative sum ( cusum ) algorithm as suggested in @xcite and communicates with a central fusion center only when it is ready to signal an alarm .",
    "in other words , each sensor communicates with the central fusion center through a one shot scheme .",
    "we assume that the @xmath0 sensors receive independent observations , which constitutes an assumption consistent with the fact that the @xmath0 change points can be different .",
    "so far in the literature ( see @xcite ) it has been assumed that the change points are the same across sensors . in this paper",
    "we consider the case in which the central fusion center employs a minimal strategy , that is , it reacts when the first communication from the sensors takes place .",
    "we demonstrate that , in the situation described above , at least asymptotically , there is no loss of information at the fusion center by employing the minimal one shot scheme .",
    "that is , we demonstrate that the minimum of @xmath0 cusums is asymptotically optimal in detecting the minimum of the @xmath0 different change points , as the mean time between false alarms tends to @xmath1 , with respect to an appropriately extended lorden criterion @xcite that incorporates the possibility of @xmath0 different change points . as an observation model we consider a continuous time brownian motion model , which is a good approximation to reality for measurements taken at a high rate .",
    "moreover , given a high rate of observations from any distribution , the central limit theorem asserts that sums of such observations are normally distributed and therefore the brownian motion model is a plausible model for such situations .",
    "the communication structure considered in this paper is summarized in figure [ fig1 ] , in which @xmath2 for @xmath3 denote stopping times associated with alarms at sensors @xmath4 @xmath3 , respectively .    in the next section",
    "we formulate the problem and demonstrate asymptotic optimality ( as the mean time between false alarms tends to @xmath1 ) , in an extended min - max lorden sense , of the minimum of @xmath0 cusum stopping times in the case of centralized detection .",
    "we then argue that this result suggests no loss in performance of the one shot minimal strategy employed by the fusion center in the case of decentralized detection .",
    "we finally discuss an extension of these results to the case of correlated sensors .",
    "we sequentially observe the processes @xmath5 for all @xmath6 with the following dynamics : @xmath7    where @xmath8 is known , . ]",
    "@xmath9 are independent standard brownian motions , and the @xmath10 s are unknown constants .",
    "an appropriate measurable space is @xmath11 and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the filtration of the observations with @xmath14 .",
    "notice that in the case of centralized detection the filtration consists of the totality of the observations that have been received up until the specific point in time @xmath15 .    on this space",
    ", we have the following family of probability measures @xmath16 , where @xmath17 corresponds to the measure generated on @xmath18 by the processes @xmath19 when the change in the @xmath0-tuple process occurs at time point @xmath10 , @xmath6 .",
    "notice that the measure @xmath20 corresponds to the measure generated on @xmath18 by @xmath0 independent brownian motions .",
    "our objective is to find a stopping rule @xmath21 that balances the trade - off between a small detection delay subject to a lower bound on the mean - time between false alarms and will ultimately detect @xmath22 . to denote @xmath22 . ]    as a performance measure we consider @xmath23 where the supremum over @xmath24 is taken over the set in which @xmath25 .",
    "that is , we consider the worst detection delay over all possible realizations of paths of the @xmath0-tuple of stochastic processes @xmath19 up to @xmath22 and then consider the worst detection delay over all possible @xmath0-tuples @xmath26 over a set in which at least one of them is forced to take a finite value .",
    "this is because @xmath21 is a stopping rule meant to detect the minimum of the @xmath0 change points and therefore if one of the @xmath0 processes undergoes a regime change , any unit of time by which @xmath21 delays in reacting , should be counted towards the detection delay .",
    "the criterion presented in ( [ extlorden ] ) results in the corresponding stochastic optimization problem of the form : @xmath27    we notice that the expectation in the above constraint is taken under the measure @xmath20 .",
    "this is the measure generated on the space @xmath18 in the case that none of the @xmath0 processes @xmath19 changes regime .",
    "therefore , @xmath28 is the mean time between false alarms .    in the case of the presence of only one stochastic process ( say @xmath29 ) , the problem becomes one of detecting a one - sided change in a sequence of brownian observations , or a vector of observations @xmath30 with the same change points , whose optimal solution was found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the optimal solution is the continuous time version of page s cusum stopping rule , namely the first passage time of the process @xmath31 and",
    "@xmath32    the cusum stopping rule is thus @xmath33    where @xmath34 is chosen so that @xmath35 , with @xmath36 ( see for example @xcite ) and @xmath37 the fact that the worst detection delay is the same as that incurred in the case in which the change point is exactly @xmath38 is a consequence of the non - negativity of the cusum process , from which it follows that the worst detection delay occurs when the cusum process at the time of the change is at @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "we remark here that if the @xmath0 change points were the same then the problem ( [ eqnproblem ] ) is equivalent to observing only one stochastic process which is now @xmath0-dimensional .",
    "thus , in this case , the detection delay and mean time between false alarms are given by the formulas in the above paragraph .",
    "returning to problem ( [ eqnproblem ] ) , it is easily seen that in seeking solutions to this problem , we can restrict our attention to stopping times that achieve the false alarm constraint with equality @xcite .",
    "the optimality of the cusum stopping rule in the presence of only one observation process suggests that a cusum type of stopping rule might display similar optimality properties in the case of multiple observation processes . in particular , an intuitively appealing rule ,",
    "when the detection of @xmath22 is of interest , is @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the cusum stopping rule for the process @xmath5 for @xmath6 .",
    "that is , we use what is known as a multi - chart cusum stopping time @xcite , which can be written as @xmath41    where @xmath42    and the @xmath43 are the restrictions of the measure @xmath17 to @xmath44 .",
    "it is easily seen that @xmath45    this is because the worst detection delay occurs when at least one of the @xmath0 processes does not change regime .",
    "the reason for this lies in the fact that the cusum process is a monotone function of @xmath46 , resulting in a longer on average passage time if @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "that is , the worst detection delay will occur when none of the other processes changes regime and due to the non - negativity of the cusum process the worst detection delay will occur when the remaining one processes is exactly at @xmath38 .",
    "notice that the threshold @xmath48 is used for the multi - chart cusum stopping rule ( [ cusummultichart ] ) in order to distinguish it from @xmath34 the threshold used for the one sided cusum stopping rule ( [ cusumstop ] ) .    in",
    "what follows we will demonstrate asymptotic optimality of ( [ cusummultichart ] ) as @xmath49 .",
    "in view of the discussion in the previous paragraph , in order to assess the optimality properties of the multi - chart cusum rule ( [ cusummultichart ] ) we will thus need to begin by evaluating @xmath50 and @xmath51 .    since the processes @xmath52 , @xmath6 , are independent it is possible to obtain a closed form expression through the formula @xmath53 @xmath54^{n-1}dt.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    similarly , @xmath55^n dt,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath56 .",
    "in other words , the evaluation of ( [ e0infty ] ) and ( [ einfty ] ) is possible through the probability density function of the random variable @xmath57 for arbitrary fixed @xmath15 which appears in @xcite .    in order to demonstrate asymptotic optimality of ( [ cusummultichart ] ) we bound the detection delay @xmath58 of the unknown optimal stopping rule @xmath59 by @xmath60 where @xmath48 is chosen so that @xmath61 it is also obvious that @xmath62 is bounded from below by the detection delay of the one cusum when there is only one observation process , in view of the fact that @xmath63 the stopping time that minimizes @xmath64 is the cusum stopping rule @xmath65 of ( [ cusumstop ] ) , with @xmath34 chosen so as to satisfy @xmath66 we will demonstrate that the difference between the upper and lower bounds @xmath67 is bounded by a constant as @xmath49 , with @xmath48 and @xmath34 satisfying ( [ facsh ] ) and ( [ facsnu ] ) , respectively .",
    "[ asymptotics ] we have @xmath68 , \\\\&~&\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as @xmath49 ,    * proof : * please refer to the appendix for a sketch of the proof",
    ".    moreover , it is easily seen from ( [ dd ] ) that @xmath69.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus we have the following result .    [ main ] the difference in detection delay @xmath58 of the unknown optimal stopping rule @xmath59 and the detection delay of @xmath70 of ( [ cusummultichart ] ) with @xmath48 satisfying ( [ facsh ] )",
    "is bounded above by @xmath71 as @xmath72 .",
    "* proof : * the proof follows from lemma [ asymptotics ] and ( [ asymptoticsn ] ) .    the upper and lower bounds on detection delay for the optimal stopping rule , when @xmath46 is @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , in the case that @xmath76 are shown in figure [ ul ] .    * the upper and lower bounds on the detection delay ( dd ) for the optimal stopping rule *    the consequence of theorem [ main ] is the asymptotic optimality of ( [ cusummultichart ] ) in the case in which all of the information becomes directly available through the filtration @xmath13 at the fusion center .",
    "we notice however that this asymptotic optimality holds for any finite number of sensors @xmath0 .",
    "we now discuss the implications of the above result in decentralized detection in the case of one shot schemes .",
    "let us now suppose that each of the observation processes @xmath77 become sequentially available at its corresponding sensor @xmath4 which then devises an asynchronous communication scheme to the central fusion center .",
    "in particular , sensor @xmath4 communicates to the central fusion center only when it wants to signal an alarm , which is elicited according to a cusum rule @xmath78 of ( [ cusumstop ] ) .",
    "once again the observations received at the @xmath0 sensors are independent and can change dynamics at distinct unknown points @xmath10 . the fusion center , whose objective is to detect the first time when there is a change , devises a minimal strategy ; that is , it declares that a change has occurred at the first instance when one of the sensors communicates an alarm .",
    "the implication of theorem [ main ] is that in fact this strategy is the best that the fusion center can devise and that there is no loss in performance between the case in which the fusion center receives the raw data @xmath79 directly and the case in which the communication that takes place is limited to the one shown in figure [ fig1 ] . to see this , the detection delay of the stopping rule @xmath80 is equal to @xmath81 when @xmath82 is the one that first signals an alarm , @xmath83 when @xmath84 first signals and so on all of which are equal due to the assumed symmetry in the signal strength @xmath46 received at each of the sensors @xmath4 when a change occurs .",
    "the mean time between false alarms for the fusion center that devises the rule @xmath85 is thus @xmath51 .",
    "but theorem [ main ] asserts that this rule , namely @xmath70 , is asymptotically optimal as the mean time between false alarms tends to @xmath1 in the centralized case for any finite @xmath0 .",
    "in other words , the cusum stopping rules @xmath86 , @xmath87 , ... , @xmath88 are sufficient statistics ( at least asymptotically ) for the problem of quickest detection of ( [ eqnproblem ] ) .",
    "an interesting extension corresponds to the case in which the signal strengths @xmath46 are different in each sensor after the change . that is , after the change the signal in @xmath4 is @xmath89 with @xmath90 . in this case , it is not clear what the optimal choice of thresholds is , but it is possible that the thresholds @xmath91 should be chosen so that @xmath92 where @xmath93 .",
    "a further interesting extension corresponds to the case of correlated sensors . to demonstrate this case",
    "let us begin by assuming that @xmath76 .",
    "this case corresponds to ( [ corr ] ) , but with @xmath94 this case becomes significantly more difficult because of the presence of local time in the dynamics of the process @xmath95 .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to derive a formula for the expected delay of @xmath70 under the measure @xmath96 .",
    "this expression is given by @xmath97 where @xmath98 denotes the dirac delta function and the final term in this expression corresponds to the collision local time of the processes @xmath99 and @xmath100 weighted by the factor @xmath101 .",
    "the difficulty in the use of expression ( [ e ] ) is the fact that as @xmath102 changes , the expected value of the collision local time term , which is the last term in ( [ e ] ) , also changes .",
    "moreover , the expression for the first moment of @xmath70 becomes significantly more complicated under the measure @xmath103 .",
