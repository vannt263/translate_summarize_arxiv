    "atomically thin layers of semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides ( sc - tmdcs ) of the form mx@xmath0 ( such as mos@xmath0 , mose@xmath0 , ws@xmath0 and wse@xmath0 ) attract a considerable research interest stimulated by the scientific curiosity to study a new class of two - dimensional ( 2d ) semiconductors and by their potential applications in optoelectronics , photonics and the development of valleytronics.@xcite bulk mx@xmath0 crystals , largely investigated in the past,@xcite consist of weakly bonded x - m - x monolayer units ( three atomic planes ) .",
    "monolayer ( 1  ml ) and few- , n - monolayer ( n  ml ) flakes of sc - tmdcs can be conveniently extracted from bulk crystals and deposited on substrates using the methods of mechanical exfoliation.@xcite since very first works on mos@xmath0 layers@xcite , it is now well established that the band structure of n  mls of sc - tmdcs critically depends on n. monolayers of sc - tmdcs are believed to be direct band gap ( or nearly direct band gap ) semiconductors and undergo a crossover to the indirect band gap structure of bulk sc - tmdcs with increasing n.@xcite strong excitonic ( coulomb ) effects , whose strength may also vary with n , is another relevant ingredient which determines the optical properties of thin films of sc - tmdcs.@xcite a thorough understanding of basic optical properties of these films is essential for advancing their further explorations , towards efficient future applications .    in this paper",
    ", we report on optical investigations of thin films of 2 with thicknesses ranging from 1  ml to 4  ml and bulk flakes , using micro - photoluminescence ( ) , micro - photoluminescence excitation ( ) and micro - reflectivity contrast ( ) spectroscopy techniques , in 5  k-300  k temperature range .",
    "our n - layer 2 structures are first characterized with low temperature , band - edge and absorption - type experiments which depict the characteristic indirect to ( nearly ) direct band gap crossover , when approaching from thicker to the 1  ml film .",
    "we then focus on the evolution of absorption resonances as a function of n in a broader energy range , as they are derived from measurements .",
    "the ground state a and spin - orbit ( so ) split b excitons associated with the k - point of the brillouin zone are each accompanied by the excited state resonances a@xmath1 and b@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "energy separation between a and a@xmath1 , and between b and b@xmath1 varies with n , which reflects the changes in the strength of excitonic binding as well as in the character of excitonic states , from non - rydberg states in 1  ml to rather rydberg like states in bulk .",
    "another clear absorption resonance c , observed in the upper spectral energy range and most sensitive to n , is tentatively assigned to the transition at the m - point of the brillouin zone .",
    "energy shift and broadening of the ground state a exciton resonance with increasing temperature are both well accounted for by conventional formulae for the band gap shrinkage and optical phonon mediated broadening of free exciton emission , which have been widely applied to other semiconductors .",
    "strikingly , the integrated pl intensity in the 1  ml of 2 is found to increase considerably with temperature , whereas opposite is observed in conventional direct band gap semiconductors . although neutral excitons ( which dominate the pl spectra at high temperature ) have higher emission efficiency than the bound / charged excitons ( which dominate the pl at low temperatures),@xcite this observation of an enhancement of integrated intensity is a thinkable sign of the presence of a radiatively inefficient channel at low temperature , which upon thermalization , transfers the carriers to radiatively efficient channel at higher temperatures .",
    "it opens up scope for further investigations and discussions on this material .",
    "finally , both neutral ( a ) and charged ( trion , t)@xcite excitonic resonances are observed in 1  ml flake not only in emission , but in absorption - type spectra as well .",
    "this allows us to demonstrate the effect of transfer of oscillator strength from trion to exciton , upon increasing the temperature.@xcite further studies of the effects of the presence of free carriers on the optical response of the wse@xmath0 monolayers are highly desirable .",
    "for preliminary characterization of the flakes , we performed atomic force microscopy ( afm ) and measurements on the flakes .",
    "insets to the fig . [ figplple ] ( c - e ) show the optical images of the flakes .",
    "the thicknesses of the 1  ml , 2  ml , 3  ml , 4  ml as well as the bulk flake were found to be @xmath20.7  nm , @xmath21.4  nm , @xmath22.1  nm , @xmath22.8  nm and @xmath220  nm respectively using afm ( data not shown ) .",
    "the pl spectra of the flakes have been shown as solid curves in fig .",
    "[ figplple](a - e ) . the 1  ml thick flake is found to emit light most efficiently , and the emission intensity reduces considerably as the thickness of the flakes is increased . a reduction in intensity by 4 orders of magnitude",
    "is observed when the flake thickness is increased from 1  ml to 20  nm . it is because the nature of the band gap changes from direct to indirect for thickness greater than 1  ml.@xcite the emission also shifts to lower energy with increasing flake thickness .",
    "this indicates the reduction of the fundamental bandgap with an increased flake thickness , in analogy to the effect of quantum confinement in semiconductor quantum wells .",
    "to gain more insight into the near band - edge properties of our layers , apart from , we performed and spectroscopy studies on the same flakes . the well pronounced , lowest energy absorption resonance seen in these spectra ( dashed blue and dashed red traces in fig . [ figplple ] )",
    "is identified with the so - called a exciton associated to the direct band alignment of 2 at k - point of the brillouin zone .",
    "its double peak structure in the monolayer ( trion t resonance on the low energy side ) and in the bulk sample ( excited exciton state a@xmath1 on the higher energy side ) will be discussed later on .",
    "a small shift in the absorption resonances seen in the ple spectra and those extracted from measurements is likely due to effectively higher sample temperature in the course of ple measurements which imply the use of laser excitation and unavoidable local heating effects , and/or due to energy sensitive carrier relaxation process which may also alter the shape of absorption as reflected in ple spectra .",
    "one of the prominent and clear features of the data shown in fig .",
    "[ figplple ] is the red shift of the pl spectra with respect to the fundamental absorption resonances .",
    "this shift progressively increases with the number of layers .",
    "it is pretty large ( @xmath2150  mev ) for the 2 bilayer and up to @xmath2500  mev in the bulk sample .",
    "the logic of indirect and low energy transitions giving rise to the pl spectra but direct and higher energy transitions determining the absorption resonances is consistent with the indirect fundamental band gap in all 2 layers with n@xmath32 .",
    "instead , however , the monolayer 2 is believed to be a direct band gap semiconductor .",
    "its strong emission intensity and partially overlapping emission and absorption spectra ( practically common emission and absorption peak due to a exciton ) are in favor of this scenario .",
    "the main part of the low temperature emission spectrum of wse@xmath0 monolayer appears still below the fundamental absorption resonance , what is , however , commonly attributed to the recombination process due to localized / bound and/or charged excitonic complexes .",
    "in fig . [ figlayerdepref](a ) , we present the results of rc experiments performed at t  =  5  k for the same flakes in a wide range of energy ( spectra are shifted vertically for clarity ) .     with sample kept at 5  k temperature .",
    "the dashed lines are the lineshape fits to the corresponding spectra .",
    "( b ) shows the absorption coefficient of the flakes derived from the lineshape fittings . in both the plots , the spectra for the layers with thickness @xmath32  ml",
    "have been shifted along the for clarity.,width=321 ]    three dominant resonances , labelled a , b and c are observed for all the different flakes . a and b are attributed to the two ground state ( @xmath4 ) excitonic absorptions at the k - point of the brillouin zone while the origin of the excitonic absorption c ( labeled as a@xmath5 in some works following ref .  )",
    "is still a matter of debate.@xcite recent * k@xmath6p * calculations predict van - hove singularities at both k and m points , with a transition energy @xmath23  ev for 1  ml.@xcite considering an excitonic binding energy equal to that of a - exciton ( 0.37  ev)@xcite as a first approximation , then the exciton transition energy of @xmath22.6  ev agrees with our observation of c - exciton .",
    "another report predicted theoretically that the possible transition at m - point should red shift by @xmath2100  mev when the flake thickness is increased from 2  ml to bulk.@xcite this is in qualitative agreement with our observed red shift of @xmath2140  mev in c - exciton indicating that this feature possibly originates from the m - point of the brillouin zone .",
    "in addition , the behaviour of c - exciton is in contrast with that shown by the a - exciton transition where the observed shift is only a @xmath220   mev , and the former is therefore unlikely to have the much debated similar origins as a - exciton i.e. at the k - point . in all the flakes ,",
    "a and b excitons are accompanied by a broad shoulder at high energy side of the excitons .",
    "we associate these features with the contributions due to the excited state ( n  =  2 and onwards ) a@xmath1 and b@xmath1 exciton transitions .",
    "this is in accordance with a recent study where the excited states of a exciton in 2 mls were observed at an energy range lying @xmath2160  mev to @xmath2370  mev above the a resonance.@xcite a collective contribution of all these states gives rise to a rather broad feature in rc spectra .",
    "furthermore , in the case of 1  ml thick flake , a feature appears towards lower energy side of the a - exciton .",
    "as discussed later , we identify this shoulder as the spectral contribution due to the formation of the trion t ( cherged exciton ) .",
    "additional high energy features appear in the rc spectra of the flakes thicker than 2  ml .",
    "an assignment of these features requires a more detailed theoretical and experimental work .    for the lineshape analysis of the rc spectra",
    ", we followed a method similar to that described in ref .  .",
    "in this method , we considered the excitonic contribution to the dielectric response function to be given by a lorentz oscillator like model as @xmath7 where @xmath8 represents the background complex refractive index of 2 in the absence of excitons and was assumed to be equal to that of the bulk material@xcite in the simulations .",
    "the index @xmath9 stands for the type of exciton characterized by a resonance energy of @xmath10 , with amplitude @xmath11 and a phenomenological broadening parameter @xmath12 [ equal to full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the lorentzian function ] .",
    "the rc was then calculated using the transfer matrix formalism . to fully reproduce our experimental data",
    ", we introduced three additional oscillators in the dielectric function of the 2 layers to account for the two observed exciton excited states and for the trion feature . the refractive indices of si and the sio@xmath0 layers were obtained from ref . .",
    "the results of this calculation for our different flakes are presented in fig .",
    "[ figlayerdepref](a ) as dashed gray lines , together with the corresponding experimental data . we notice that the overall background shape of the reflectance contrast spectra has been reproduced quite well using transfer matrix method .",
    "also , the lorentz oscillator model has been able to reproduce the exciton lineshapes nicely .",
    "it is then tempting to express these results in the form of the absorption coefficient @xmath13 , defined as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the imaginary part of the refractive index .",
    "the calculated wavelength dependence of the absorption coefficient for the flakes are presented in fig .",
    "[ figlayerdepref](b ) .",
    "the transition energies derived from the modelling of our data are presented in fig .",
    "[ figlayerdepenergies ] as a function of the flake thickness .     and b@xmath1 and the trion t as a function of number of layers.,width=264 ]    both a and c - exciton energies decrease with increasing the number of layers , the effect being most pronounced for c. the energy of the b exciton appears to be only weakly dependent on the number of layers .",
    "interestingly , the energy of both excited states a@xmath1 and b@xmath1 increases from 1  ml to 2  ml and then decreases for larger thicknesses .",
    "this peculiar evolution observed only for the exciton excited states is due to two competing effects .",
    "the first effect is the reduction of the exciton binding energy , possibly due to the change of the dielectric environment and of the dimensionality of the material from 2d- towards a more 3d system .",
    "the second effect is characteristic of tmdcs monolayers and arises from the nonlocal character of screening of the coulomb interactions in such systems.@xcite indeed , exciton excited states in 1  ml 2 strongly deviate from the hydrogenic rydberg model,@xcite verified for conventional 2d semiconductors .",
    "they were experimentally observed much closer in energy to the ground state than expected .",
    "this effect dominates in the case of the 1  ml flake but ceases to contribute when the number of layers is increased .",
    "when going from the monolayer to the thicker flakes , the excited state energy increases in a first step because the exciton structure recovers its rydberg character but simultaneously , the exciton binding energy decreases when going towards the 3d limit .",
    "the latter effect dominates for stacks thicker than 3  ml and the excited state energy then decreases .",
    "this scenario has to be confirmed on theoretical grounds .    assuming that the dominant contribution to the a@xmath1 structure for the bulk comes from the n  =  2 state of the exciton",
    ", we find an a exciton binding energy of @xmath260  mev following the ideal rydberg model for 3d case .",
    "this is in agreement with a previous report.@xcite we notice that for 2  ml flake , the b@xmath1 resonance merges with the c exciton peak and is omitted from the fitting procedure .",
    "for the bulk flake , the b@xmath1 structure is too weak to be included in the analysis . from the rc fitting of the 1",
    "ml thick flake , the trion ( t ) binding energy is estimated to be @xmath230  mev which agrees quite well with a recently reported value.@xcite",
    "to explore the properties of a exciton and t trions further , we performed spectroscopy of the 1  ml thick flake as a function of temperature .",
    "in addition , we performed temperature dependent measurements of a exciton in a 2  ml and a 20  nm thick bulk flake . figures  [ figtempdepref](a - c ) show the evolution of the rc spectra around the a exciton peak as a function of temperature ( 5  k to 300  k ) for 1  ml , 2  ml and 20  nm thick flake respectively , along with the calculated spectra . in the fitting procedure ,",
    "we have also considered t for 1  ml and a@xmath1 for the bulk flake .",
    "commonly for the three studied films , the exciton resonance energies undergo a red shift with increasing temperature as shown in fig .",
    "[ figtempdepref](d ) .",
    "this evolution , very typical for semiconductors , can be reproduced by the bandgap versus temperature relations , equally well when using the varshni@xcite or odonnell _ _ et al.__@xcite formulae .",
    "varshni s relation is given by : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the band gap at absolute zero , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the fitting parameters related to the temperature - dependent dilatation of the lattice and debye temperature respectively .",
    "although , this relationship describes the evolution of band gap , it reproduces the exciton resonance energies equally well , which suggests the independence of exciton binding energy on temperature .",
    ".fitting parameters as obtained from fitting of temperature dependence of the ground state exciton resonance energies and lineshape broadenings for 1  ml , 2  ml and bulk 2 flakes [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the parameters which fit the data are given in table  [ tablevarshni ] .",
    "we notice that the parameter @xmath18 shows a reduction as the thickness of the flake is increased from 1  ml to 2  ml and bulk .",
    "notably , there is a fundamental change in the crystal lattice when the thickness is increased from 1  ml thickness onwards . however , the @xmath19 parameter is @xmath2170  k for all the three kinds of flakes , and it was fixed to this value during the fitting .",
    "the effective debye temperature seems therefore to be independent of the film thickness .",
    "our estimation of @xmath19 parameter of 2 is in agreement with a previous report of hu et al . where a value of @xmath20  k was found from the photoconductivity measurements on bulk crystals.@xcite the relation provided by odonnell et al",

    "similar to @xmath19 parameter , @xmath21 stays nearly the same @xmath215  mev , and its value was fixed during fitting .",
    "the s parameter shows a gradual decrease from the monolayer to the bulk .",

    "[ eqnlor ] ) obtained from the fits in figs .",

    "the temperature dependence of the width of the n  =  1 ground state exciton has the form@xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the broadening at 0  k , the term linear in t depicts the interaction of excitons with acoustic phonons and the last term arises from interaction with lo ( longitudinal optical ) phonons .",
    "the former is neglected being negligibly small compared to the latter , which is proportional to the bose function for lo - phonon occupation .",
    "@xmath25 is the lo - phonon energy and is taken to be equal to 31.25  mev ( 250  @xmath26 ) for 2.@xcite the fits to the data are shown as solid lines in fig .  [ figtempdepref](e ) and the fitting parameters are shown in table  [ tablevarshni ] .",
    "we notice that @xmath24 , which depends on the film quality , is different for the three films studied .",
    "however , @xmath27 is similar for 1  ml and 2  ml flakes , whereas it is larger for the bulk film .",
    "it can be understood as follows . for 1  ml and 2  ml films ,",
    "the binding energy of the exciton is much larger than the lo phonon energy , therefore the probability of scattering of the ground state exciton to its excited bound and continuum states through the lo - phonons is negligible.@xcite in such a case , the scattering of the exciton assisted by an annihilation of lo - phonons is mostly permissible within the n  =  1 state , to higher in energy excitonic states with larger center - of mass momentum .",
    "however , for the bulk case , the exciton binding energy is comparable to that of lo - phonon energy .",
    "therefore , the ground state exciton has a significant probability to scatter to the energetically accessible excited exciton states through annihilation of an lo - phonon .",
    "such additional contributions give rise to an increase in broadening in the bulk flake as compared to the 1 and 2  ml flakes at elevated temperatures , in turn increasing the slope of the @xmath28(t ) curve .",
    "the monolayers of sc - tmdcs are commonly accepted to be the direct band gap semiconductors and their optical response in the vicinity of the band edge is understood in terms of the associated excitonic resonances ( free- , charged- and localized / bound excitons ) . at low temperatures and in the presence of impurities and/or free carries ,",
    "the localized / bound and/or charged exciton states ( trions ) usually dominate the pl response of direct gap semiconductors whereas the free exciton emission is rather weakly pronounced .",
    "this picture can also be applied to account for low temperature spectra of our 2 monolayer , as shown in the bottom traces in fig .",
    "[ figtrionsandexc](a ) .",
    "these spectra consist of up to four emission peaks which , in line with the previous studies , can be attributed to the neutral exciton ( a ) , charged exciton ( t , trion ) and two localized / bound excitons ( l1 and l2).@xcite the observed evolution of the spectra with temperature is , however , intriguing . to begin with ,",
    "when the temperature is raised , the l1 and l2 peaks disappear from the spectra ( at @xmath240  k ) initially whereas the higher energy trion emission survives up to considerable higher temperatures ( up to @xmath2200  k ) .",
    "the opposite would be expected when naively assuming that lower in energy excitonic complexes should have higher dissociation / activation energies .",
    "this assumption may not , however , apply to tmdcs monolayers for which the t complexes have been speculated to exhibit higher dissociation energies than the impurity - bound excitons@xcite , in overall agreement with our observation .",
    "regardless of the apparent dissociation energies , the pl dynamics is another relevant parameter which has to be taken account when discussing the pl changes with temperature .",
    "time resolved pl studies of 2 monolayers show that a - exciton emission decays rather fast ( few picoseconds decay time ) whereas the decay time of the subsequent lower in energy pl peaks progressively increases up to @xmath2100  ps for the l2 peak.@xcite the temperature - activated population of higher energy states , which presumably give rise to the emission more effectively could also qualitatively account for the observed temperature - activated redistribution of the pl intensity among different emission peaks .        this redistribution itself can be qualitatively understood but the observed rise of the integrated pl intensity with temperature ( inset to fig .  [ figtrionsandexc](a ) ) is a veritable puzzle .",
    "typically in semiconductors , a quenching of the pl intensity is observed with increasing temperature .",
    "the observed rise of the pl yield ( integrated intensity ) is particularly striking because it appears at relatively higher temperatures where all the emission appears to arise due to recombination of free excitons .",
    "we do not have a solid explanation for this effect but can not restrain from speculating on its possible origin .",
    "we put forward an hypothesis where we speculate an existence of certain dark , optically inactive states in the 2 monolayer , below the ground state a exciton .",
    "those dark states could be associated with the excitons indirect in k - space , which is however in contradiction with a general belief that the 2 monolayer is a direct gap semiconductor,@xcite ( though the consensus in this matter may not have been reached so far@xcite ) .",
    "optionally one could speculate about other dark excitonic states , similar to the exchange - split dark excitons in conventional semiconductors,@xcite in case of the specific alignment of the signs of the spin - orbit splitting in the conduction and valence bands of the 2 monolayer.@xcite the existence of such states could also qualitatively account for a double exponential decay of the a - emission reported recently from time resolved experiments.@xcite nonetheless , firm conclusions about the fine structure of the fundamental exciton in 2 monolayer require further experiments and theoretical studies .",
    "the appearance of charged excitons in sc - tmdcs has been largely discussed in literature,@xcite though their identification has been so far based on the pl spectroscopy only .",
    "most convincing with this respect are the pl experiments carried out as a function of the gate voltage ( carrier concentration),@xcite nevertheless the distinction between the bound / localized and ( free ) trion states as observed in low temperature pl is rather a subtle issue .",
    "vast studies of conventional two dimensional structures ( e.g. cdte@xcite and gaas@xcite ) show that charged excitons are characterized by the significant oscillator strength and should be also visible in absorption type spectra , whereas bound / localized excitons may be predominant in the pl spectra . with the results shown in fig .",

    "[ figtrionsandexc](b ) ] as well .",
    "observation of trions in absorption spectra is further confirmed by spectral evolution with temperature .",
    "a characteristic transfer of the oscillator strength from the trion to neutral exciton is observed upon increasing the temperature .",
    "this effect is analogous to what has been largely discussed in the context of optical studies of ( weakly doped ) cdte and gaas quantum wells.@xcite generally speaking , the loss and gain of the oscillator strength of charged and neutral exciton with temperature , respectively , is due to the thermal redistribution of free carriers from fermi - dirac statistics at low temperature towards boltzmann distribution at higher temperatures .",
    "the increase of temperature opens the k - space around the band edge for the efficient formation of the neutral exciton which leads to its increased oscillator strength . on the other hand",
    ", the weakening of the oscillator strength of charged excitons associated with carriers with higher k - wave vectors explains the progressive disappearance of the trion absorption with temperature .",
    "quantitative analysis of the transfer of the oscillator strength from trion to neutral exciton remains to be done in future , on samples with the controlled carrier concentration .",

    "<S> we present optical spectroscopy ( photoluminescence and reflectance ) studies of thin layers of the transition metal dichalcogenide 2 , with thickness ranging from mono- to tetra - layer and in the bulk limit . </S>",
    "<S> the investigated spectra show the evolution of excitonic resonances as a function of layer thickness , due to changes in the band structure and , importantly , due to modifications of the strength of coulomb interaction as well . the observed temperature - activated energy shift and broadening of the fundamental direct exciton </S>",
    "<S> are well accounted for by standard formalisms used for conventional semiconductors . a large increase of the photoluminescence yield with temperature </S>",
    "<S> is observed in wse@xmath0 monolayer , indicating the existence of competing radiative channels . </S>",
    "<S> the observation of absorption - type resonances due to both neutral and charged excitons in 2 monolayer is reported and the effect of the transfer of oscillator strength from charged to neutral exciton upon increase of temperature is demonstrated . </S>"
