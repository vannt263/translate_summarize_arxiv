    "statistical physics has become a powerful framework to investigate the collective behavior of individuals and is playing an increasingly prominent role in quantitative social sciences studies . a case in point",
    "is opinion dynamics @xcite that aims at describing the emergent social behaviour , by considering models with simple rules of opinion formation through which agents update their internal state , or opinion , through the interactions with other agents. the interactions are typically local rules that consist in ( a ) following the majority or ( b ) random neighbour imitation , two simple mechanisms that have been studied for decades as models for the dynamics of ising spin systems , known in the physics literature as the glauber and voter models , respectively @xcite .",
    "traditional statistical physics models consider particles ( spins , agents ) interacting ( i ) with all the other particles as analytical solutions are often possible in this mean - field limit or ( ii ) with a number of neighbours located on the vertices of regular lattices in d dimensions , the topology characteristic of crystalline solids .",
    "recently , however , the field of complex networks @xcite paved the way for a better description of social dynamics , by providing adequate models for networks of social interactions that are neither well mixed as in ( i ) nor completely regular as in ( ii ) .",
    "since then , numerous studies have considered the evolution of opinion models on complex networks , and investigated the effects of the network topology on the model s dynamical behavior .",
    "in particular , novel , non - trivial behaviour has been found for the ordering dynamics of the zero temperature glauber and voter models on complex networks @xcite .",
    "language competition may be viewed as a particular case of consensus problems and as such has motivated related studies @xcite .",
    "other aspects of language dynamics include language change and evolution and language learning . in this context",
    "we follow the pioneering work of @xcite and consider an evolutionary game model where the errors in learning are assumed to be the major determinant for language change .",
    "this class of models for language change are based on the assumption that languages evolve like individuals in a population : the fittest survive and spread , the less fit are eliminated . the two driving forces evolution , selection and mutation ( i.e. language transmission with a bias that favours the fittest or the dominant language and errors in the transmission process ) ,",
    "are incorporated into the replicator - mutator dynamics equations and the time scale for change is generational .    in the framework of evolutionary models for language dynamics ,",
    "the question that arises is : how accurately children have to learn the language of their parents in order for the population to maintain a coherent language ?",
    "the question was answered in a series of papers @xcite that show that in the strong selection limit a critical threshold , largely determined by the error rate of language acquisition , exists for infinite ( well mixed ) populations , irrespective of the number of languages in competition @xcite .",
    "more recently , language games such as the naming game used to model the emergence of language understood as a consensual lexicon @xcite have attracted the attention of the physics community @xcite .",
    "this class of models focuses on the horizontal transmission and creation of language as a result of peer - to - peer interaction , in contrast with vertical transmission , the basic scheme of language change in models inspired by biological evolution @xcite .",
    "apart from the time scale for change , which is no longer generational , here the question is to establish when the dynamics of a set of interacting agents that can choose among several options leads to consensus , or alternatively , when a state with several coexisting options , or language diversity , prevails .",
    "the discovery of critical thresholds in the naming game is arguably the most important contribution of statistical physics in a problem of computational linguistics .",
    "another class of evolutionary models of languages with analogies with the theories of population genetics was proposed by baxter et al @xcite .",
    "the model was solved in the limit of a single speaker as well as for multiple speakers in the mean - field approximation and ( in these limits ) it was shown to be related to the model of abrams and strogatz @xcite for the extinction of languages .    in this work",
    "we follow the view on evolutionary models of language dynamics proposed by @xcite and consider the investigation of noise induced thresholds for linguistic coherence . in other words , we focus on the study ( both for deterministic and stochastic versions ) of the effectivness of the rate of learning errors , in precluding the emergence of linguistic consensus . in this framework",
    "the coherence threshold is the error rate of language acquisition above which a multi - lingual community is stable and below which there is a single dominant language .    in the following ,",
    "we extend the work of @xcite by analysing ( i ) a family of fitness driven models based on the replicator - mutator dynamics , that reduce to the glauber and voter models in the limit of neutral evolution and ( ii ) non - trivial networks of interaction .",
    "the results detailed below are based on the original komarova - nowak @xcite model with these generalizations , although the time scale for change through learning and selection is no longer generational . as in other models of social interaction and opinion dynamics ,",
    "learning and selection occur on a shorter time scale , associated with horizontal ( peer - to - peer ) interaction .",
    "the basic assumptions of our family of models are that each individual in the population is a speaker of one of two languages @xmath0 or @xmath1 , and that an individual may change its language through interactions with its neighbours .",
    "these interactions follow certain rules , where the fitnesses of the individual and of its neighbours determine the probability for language change in the absence of errors . in line with the usual replicator - mutator dynamics the state update that comes out of these rules",
    "is reversed with probability @xmath2 , that models learning errors as the presence of noise in the system coupled to the dynamics . in order to assess the robustness of the coherence threshold of the replicator - mutator dynamics we consider models with more general fitness driven rules , that reduce to the voter and glauber models in the limit of neutral evolution and zero noise .",
    "the latter are models of spin dynamics , used to model the mechanisms of opinion dynamics and cultural evolution , that play a role in the evolution of languages on short time scales .",
    "we find that , in general , in well mixed populations dynamical noise is not effective in driving a critical coherence threshold . in models that reduce to the voter and glauber dynamics in the limit of neutral fitness the noise induced thresholds , separating a dominant language regime from the regime where different languages co - exist , become non - critical in the mean - field limit .",
    "we derive analytical solutions for the coherence thresholds of the models in complete and regular random graphs , that are shown to provide a very good description of the different types of cooperative behaviour of this family of models .",
    "in particular , the increase in robustness of the coherent linguistic regime as the number of neighbours increases is described quantitatively by the analytical solutions , for all dynamical models .",
    "finally , we put our results in a more general context and provide a complete classification of the threshold behaviour of a family of fitness driven models models that includes a flipping rate , or noise uncoupled to the dynamics , instead of the dynamical noise of the replicator - mutator equations .",
    "we consider the simplest case of the model introduced in @xcite characterized by strong selection and two equally fit languages , with no affinity between them .",
    "following @xcite , we consider a population of @xmath3 individuals , where each individual @xmath4 speaks one of two languages @xmath5 and define the fitness @xmath6 of @xmath4 as the number of its neighbors that speak the same language , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a sum over the neighbors of @xmath4 and @xmath9 is @xmath0 if @xmath10 and @xmath11 otherwise .",
    "the evolution of the language follows two general rules : ( i ) the language of the fittest individuals at a given time step ( generation ) has a higher probability of being learnt by the population in the next time step ( selection ) ; ( ii ) in the process of learning there is a probability of error , i.e. a probability that the new generation learns a language with a lower fitness ( mutation ) .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that , in well mixed infinite populations , this model exhibits a critical coherence threshold , determined by the rate of learning errors , below which a dominant language is established and maintained in the population . in what follows we analyse the robustness of the linguistic coherence threshold when other mechanisms of evolution and networks of interaction are considered .",
    "in particular , we consider two generalizations of the replicator - mutator model by introducing : ( i ) more general fitness driven dynamics ( including additional imitation / social pressure mechanisms ) and ( ii ) populations with non - trivial interaction networks .",
    "we define the social fitness of an individual speaker , @xmath12 , as the total fitness of the neighbors of @xmath4 that speak language @xmath13 at generation @xmath14 : @xmath15 and denote by @xmath2 the probability of learning errors ( @xmath16 ) . unless otherwise stated the population has a fixed number @xmath3 of individuals .",
    "the language ( of the population ) at a given time step , @xmath14 , is characterized by the array @xmath17 . in the next time",
    "step the language is determined by the probability that each individual changes its language , through the combined effect of the dynamics and learning errors .",
    "we have considered three fitness driven dynamical models , with learning errors , as detailed below .      in this model the noise , or rate of learning errors , is incorporated in the probability of language change . if @xmath18 the probability for language change ( i.e. , the probability that the outcome of the update rule is @xmath19 ) is given by @xcite , @xmath20 while if @xmath21 the probability for language change ( i.e. , the probability that the outcome of the update rule is @xmath22 ) is given by , @xmath23      the update rule for this model is inspired in the simplest opinion / imitation dynamics model , the voter model : a speaker changes language if its fitness is lower than a randomly chosen neighbour that speaks a different language .",
    "in addition , with probability @xmath2 the outcome of the dynamical rule is reversed .",
    "the update rule for a speaker @xmath4 at time @xmath14 is the following : ( i ) choose one neighbor , @xmath24 , at random ; ( ii ) if @xmath25 then @xmath26 ; ( iii ) if @xmath27 then @xmath28 ; ( iv ) reverse the outcome of the dynamical rule with probability @xmath2 .",
    "the update rule for this model is inspired in the glauber dynamics of spin systems , that mimicks the effect of social pressure in opinion dynamics . in this model",
    "each individual tends to adopt the fittest ( dominant ) language in its neighborhood .",
    "the update rule for a speaker @xmath4 at time @xmath14 is the following : ( i ) if @xmath29 then @xmath22 ; ( ii ) if @xmath30 then @xmath19 ; ( iii ) if @xmath31 then @xmath32 ; ( iv ) reverse the outcome of the dynamical rule with probability @xmath2 .",
    "the models described above were first simulated on complete graphs or fully connected networks , i.e. , where all individuals are neighbors of each other . on these networks the fitness of individuals speaking the same language is identical , in each time step ( generation ) : the fitness of individuals speaking @xmath33(@xmath1 ) is @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) , where @xmath36 is the total number of speakers of @xmath0 .",
    "we start the simulations from a fully ordered system , i.e. , at @xmath37 all individuals speak language @xmath33 ( say ) . the language of the next generation is determined according to the rules described above for each model .",
    "the language of the population evolves through a large number of generations ( 5000 ) and the mean value of @xmath38 is calculated for each value of error rate in learning , @xmath2 .    in figure 1",
    "we plot the results of simulations of the three dynamics , for different population sizes , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 . although finite size effects are visible for the smaller systems they are negligible for populations of thousands .",
    "while we find a critical coherence threshold , at @xmath42 , reproducing the results of @xcite for the komorova - nowak model , the results for the voter and glauber fitness driven models are quite different : the threshold is shifted to the value of the noise that completely overrides the dynamics , @xmath43 , and the fraction of speakers of the dominant language approaches @xmath44 linearly , at the threshold , revealing its non critical nature .    in order to investigate the effects of the network of interactions on the linguistic coherence threshold we simulated the same models on regular random graphs ( rrg ) , where analytical results may also be obtained . in rrg networks",
    "@xmath3 nodes are linked at random to a fixed number of neighbors , @xmath45 , without double and self links .",
    "the models were simulated on two of these networks , for small ( @xmath46 ) and large ( @xmath47 ) degree .",
    "the simulations , for @xmath48 and @xmath49 , start ( as before ) in the ordered state where all individuals speak @xmath33 . for each value of @xmath2",
    ", the language evolves through 10000 generations at the end of which the average fraction of speakers of the dominant language is computed .",
    "the results for the three models are plotted in figures 2,3 and 4 .",
    "note that the transition on rrg exibhits a critical threshold for all models .",
    "the value of @xmath2 at threshold , @xmath50 , increases with the number of neighbours and approaches the mf values ( @xmath51 for the replicator mutator and @xmath52 for the voter and glauber dynamics ) as the number of neighbours tends to infinity . above threshold ,",
    "@xmath53 , the equilibrium value of @xmath54 corresponds to the coexistence of the two languages , @xmath55 .",
    "in order to shed light on these results we proceed to calculate the equilibrium values of @xmath36 analytically , in the infinite population limit .",
    "let @xmath54 be the fraction of speakers of language @xmath0 ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "the evolution of @xmath54 is given by , @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the rates of change of the two competing languages .",
    "in well mixed populations @xmath58 and @xmath59 depend only on @xmath54 and can be computed exactly for the three models .",
    "on rrg networks these probabilities are calculated using the following ( mean - field ) assumptions : ( i ) each of the @xmath45 neighbours of any site are linked to @xmath60 second neighbors , with no loops ( uncorrelated links ) ; ( ii ) the probability that the language spoken at a given site is @xmath33 is the average density of speakers of that language , @xmath54 ( uncorrelated densities ) . within this mean - field approximation ,",
    "the fitness of each node is a random variable that results from the sum of @xmath45 independent and identical binomial variables .",
    "the calculation of the transition probabilities @xmath58 and @xmath59 depends on the specific dynamics and proceeds in a straightforward fashion .",
    "given the symmetry of the models the probabilities ( [ eq : evolxtime ] ) may be written as , @xmath61 where @xmath62 is a function that depends on the network of contacts and on the dynamics . substituting ( [ p1m1],[pm11 ] ) , ( [ eq : evolxtime ] ) becomes @xmath63    in what follows we discuss the meaning of @xmath62 for each dynamical model and calculate it for each network of contacts .",
    "we find by inspection of ( [ p1m1nk],[pm11nk ] ) and ( [ p1m1],[pm11 ] ) that for the replicator - mutator model , @xmath62 ( @xmath64 ) is the normalized value of @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) in the neighbourhood of a speaker of language @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) , @xmath67    in well mixed populations , @xmath65 and @xmath68 take their mean values , and @xmath62 becomes , @xmath69 substituting ( [ qrmmf ] ) into ( [ xdot ] ) yields the evolution equation , @xmath70 and the ( stable ) fixed points , @xmath71 , are solutions of @xmath72 .",
    "it is straightforward to show that @xmath73 confirming that @xmath74 is the threshold for linguistic coherence .",
    "furthermore , this threshold is critical since the derivative of @xmath71 w.r.t .",
    "@xmath2 diverges there .",
    "the function ( [ eqnk ] ) is plotted , for @xmath75 , in figure 1 , and excellent agreement is found between the analytical solution and the simulation results for large systems .",
    "the transition probabilities of the replicator - mutator model on rrg are calculated by determining the average value of the total fitnesses @xmath76 and @xmath77 in the neighborhood of a given node .",
    "let us consider a node @xmath4 that speaks @xmath33 with @xmath78 neighbours that speak also @xmath33 .",
    "the average fitness of one of these neighbours is @xmath79 and that of the neighbours speaking @xmath1 is @xmath80 .",
    "the average values of @xmath76 and @xmath77 are then , @xmath81 the number of neighbours of @xmath4 speaking the same language , @xmath78 , is a random variable that results from the sum of @xmath45 random binomial variables , each one taking the value @xmath0 with probability @xmath54 and @xmath11 with probability @xmath82 .",
    "the function @xmath62 in ( [ qrm ] ) is then , @xmath83 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are given by ( [ fmnk],[fpnk ] ) and @xmath84 is the binomial coefficient , @xmath85 the evolution equation is obtained by substituting ( [ qrmrrg ] ) in ( [ xdot ] ) .",
    "the stable fixed points as a function of the noise parameter are ploted in figure 2 for @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively . for regular random graphs with @xmath86",
    "the agreement between the simulation and the analytic results is almost quantitative , for populations of the order of a few thousand .      in the fitness",
    "driven voter dynamics an individual that speaks language @xmath0 changes to language @xmath1 : with probability @xmath87 if the neighbour chosen at random speaks @xmath1 and has a higher fitness ; with probability @xmath2 if the neighbour chosen at random speaks @xmath0 or has a lower fitness .",
    "thus , @xmath62 ( @xmath64 ) is the probability to find a neighbour that speaks @xmath1 ( @xmath0 ) and has a higher fitness . in the mean field approximation ,",
    "@xmath62 is @xmath88 the product of the probability @xmath82 of finding a neighbor that speaks @xmath1 and the probability @xmath89 that a speaker of @xmath1 has higher fitness than a speaker of @xmath0 .    in well mixed populations , the probability that a speaker @xmath1 has",
    "a higher fitness is @xmath0 ( @xmath11 ) for @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) implying that , @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the step function : @xmath94 if @xmath95 and @xmath96 if @xmath97 .",
    "the dynamical equation is obtained by substituting ( [ q1vm ] ) into ( [ xdot ] ) and has stable fixed point solutions , @xmath72 , given by @xmath98 where @xmath99 .",
    "again , the rate of learning errors @xmath100 defines two regimes : for @xmath101 a dominant language is established and maintained while for @xmath102 there is coexistence of the two equally probable languages .",
    "note , however , that @xmath103 is a trivial threshold in the sense that for this level of noise the evolution is totally random , while for higher levels of noise the evolution rules actually hinder linguistic coherence .",
    "this trivial threshold is non critical since , @xmath104 the derivative at threshold is finite .",
    "the function ( [ eqvm ] ) is plotted , for @xmath75 , in figure 1 , and apart from the finite size effects mentioned previously , quantitative agreement is found between the analytical solution and the simulation results .    to calculate @xmath89 for rrg ,",
    "let us consider a node @xmath4 with @xmath105 , and a neighbor @xmath24 with @xmath106 . using the definition of fitness and the rules of the voter dynamics we can compute @xmath89 as the probability that @xmath24 has a number @xmath107 of neighbours speaking @xmath1 that is larger than the number @xmath78 of neighbours of @xmath4 speaking @xmath33 , @xmath108 the stable fixed points are calculated using ( [ xdot ] ) with @xmath62 given by ( [ eq : qvdrnet],[eq : hvotd ] ) and solving for @xmath109 .",
    "in general ( @xmath110 ) they are more easily written in terms of @xmath111 , @xmath112 where @xmath113 .",
    "@xmath111 given by ( [ fixpvd2 ] ) is plotted in figure 3 for @xmath91 .",
    "the calculated @xmath114 is in line with the results of the simulation and for @xmath86 the agreement becomes nearly quantitative .      in the fitness",
    "driven glauber dynamics , @xmath62 is the probability that a speaker @xmath4 of @xmath33 has total fitness satisfying @xmath115 .    in well mixed populations , @xmath116 iff @xmath90 and",
    "therefore , @xmath117 substituting in ( [ xdot ] ) and solving for the stable fixed points we obtain @xmath118    the rate of learning errors @xmath100 is again a trivial threshold that separates two regimes as in the voter driven model .",
    "also as in the voter model the threshold is non - critical since , the derivative of @xmath2 at threshold is finite and the fraction of speakers of the dominant language approaches the threshold linearly .",
    "the function ( [ fixpgd ] ) is plotted , for @xmath75 , in figure 1 , and excellent agreement is found between the analytical solution and the simulation results , for large systems .    in order to calculate @xmath62 for rrg , we consider in the neighborhood of a given node @xmath4 that is a @xmath33 speaker : ( i ) @xmath78 nearest neighbors that speak @xmath33 ; ( ii ) @xmath119 next nearest neighbours that speak @xmath33 and share with @xmath4 a nearest neighbour that speaks @xmath33 ; ( iii ) @xmath120 next nearest neighbours that speak @xmath1 and share with @xmath4 a nearest neighbour that speaks @xmath1 .",
    "then the total fitnesses are simply given by @xmath121 and @xmath122 and @xmath62 is the probability that @xmath123 , @xmath124 the fixed points are calculated using ( [ xdot ] ) and solving for @xmath125 .",
    "the function @xmath111 obtained is of the form ( [ fixpvd2 ] ) with @xmath126 and @xmath62 given by ( [ gxgd ] ) .",
    "@xmath111 is plotted in figure 4 for @xmath91 and is found to be in line with the results of the simulations . for @xmath86 the agreement is almost quantitative .",
    "again , the transition exibhits a critical threshold and the value of @xmath50 also increases with the number of nearest neighbours on the network approaching the mf value , @xmath127 , as this number approaches infinity . above threshold ,",
    "@xmath53 , the stable fixed point corresponds to the coexistence of the two languages , @xmath55 .",
    "for all the models considered above , the mean field description of the dynamics is given by equation ( [ xdot ] ) which is of the form @xmath128 with @xmath129 and @xmath130 . for ( [ eqgen ] ) to describe the mean field dynamics of an evolution process that selects for the dominant variant of two languages or species with the same intrinsic fitness , the additional assumptions are that @xmath131 and @xmath132 for @xmath133 , so that the coherent states @xmath134 and @xmath135 are the only stable solutions in the absence of noise .",
    "the threshold behaviour of this type of models is easily understood if we consider the related family @xmath136 where @xmath137 has the same symmetry properties as @xmath138 and noise and dynamics are uncoupled , so that @xmath2 represents a constant rate of random flipping independent of the evolution rules .",
    "indeed , ( [ eqgen ] ) can be brought to the form ( [ eqdrift ] ) with @xmath139 through a smooth rescaling of time , provided that @xmath138 is smooth . from equation ( [ eqdrift ] ) , the curve @xmath140 that relates the rate of random flipping @xmath2 with the corresponding equilibrium density @xmath54 is @xmath141 if we assume that @xmath142 is smooth , then given the symmetry @xmath143 and therefore @xmath144 this means that models ( [ eqdrift ] ) , ( [ eqgen ] ) always exhibit critical coherence thresholds when @xmath145 , @xmath146 are smooth .",
    "the values of the critical thresholds found in this section are particular cases of equation ( [ threshdrift ] ) , which for model ( [ eqgen ] ) reads @xmath147 equation ( [ eqcurve ] ) also shows that whenever @xmath142 is a step function with a discontinuity at @xmath44 , then model ( [ eqdrift ] ) has no coherence threshold : a dominant language persists for arbitrarily large levels of noise , because the right and left limits @xmath148 and @xmath149 are both infinite .",
    "the behaviour of model ( [ eqgen ] ) when @xmath138 is a step function with a discontinuity at @xmath44 , as for the fitness driven voter and glauber dynamics on the complete graph , may be obtained directly from the analogue of equation ( [ eqcurve ] ) for model ( [ eqgen ] ) @xmath150 then @xmath151 independently of @xmath146 , and @xmath152 which is always bounded away from zero .",
    "therefore , this class of models will exhibit a non critical trivial threshold at @xmath43 .    to summarize , the family of models described at the mean field level by equations ( [ eqgen ] ) , ( [ eqdrift ] ) exhibits three types of threshold behaviour .",
    "models with non - smooth density dependence transition rates @xmath138 and dynamically coupled noise exhibit a trivial non - critical threshold at the value of @xmath43 for which noise completely overrides the dynamics . models with non - smooth density dependence transition rates",
    "@xmath142 and dynamically uncoupled noise do not exhibit a noise induced threshold , i.e. there is always a dominant language irrespective of the level of noise .",
    "finally , in the generic case of models with smooth transition rates @xmath138 , @xmath142 there is a critical threshold , below which language coherence may be established and maintained .",
    "we have considered different models for the evolution in the presence of noise of two languages with the same intrinsic fitness that compete through the selective advantage of the language that is perceived by each individual as the dominant language .",
    "the language spoken by each speaker has for that speaker a social fitness given by the number of its neighbours that share the same language , and the dynamics driven by evolution rules based on this fitness measure will depend also on the interaction network of the population . starting from a state where all individuals speak the same language , mutations or transmission errors act as noise terms that favour the balance of the number of speakers of each language ,",
    "while selection according to social fitness drives linguistic coherence .",
    "the coherence threshold is the level of noise or mutation rate above which the system evolves to a state where both languages are equally frequent .    from simulations of these models on fully connected networks and on regular random graphs",
    ", we found that the critical threshold for the replicator - mutator model @xcite is robust with respect to the network structure , but that the coherence thresholds of related models are strongly affected by this feature .",
    "in particular , we have found that models with social fitness driven dynamics inspired by the voter and glauber models , two of the simplest models for spin dynamics used in opinion dynamics and cultural evolution studies , exhibit different linguistic coherence threshold behaviour , depending on the network of interactions . on a regular random graph ,",
    "these models have a critical coherence threshold , while on the fully connected network a dominant language persists up to the level of noise for which the evolution rules are totally random .",
    "we have obtained analytical mean - field solutions for the coherence thresholds on the fully connected network and on regular random networks that are in agreement with the results of the simulations for the three models , providing a quantitative description of the behaviour of the different microscopic rules .",
    "we have shown that the noise threshold behaviours of these models and , more generally , of evolution processes that select for the dominant variant of two languages or species with the same intrinsic fitness , can be understood as well in terms of a simple mean field analysis .",
