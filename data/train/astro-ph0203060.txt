    "the class of pulsating stars known as cepheids is a cornerstone in determining the distances to nearby galaxies .",
    "this is because cepheids exhibit a well - behaved period - luminosity relation which can be locally calibrated @xcite .",
    "in addition , these stars are massive and thus intrinsically very luminous , making it possible to observe cepheids located in very distant galaxies @xcite .",
    "because of the usefulness and fundamental importance of cepheids , it is important to calibrate their period - luminosity relation .",
    "this has been done using a variety of methods , including parallax @xcite , baade - wesselink methods @xcite and surface brightness @xcite .",
    "the period - luminosity relations used currently have uncertainties on the order of 0.09 mag @xcite , which in turn make up a significant portion of the systematic uncertainty in estimates to the large magellanic cloud .",
    "using long - baseline stellar interferometry it is possible to resolve the diameter changes undergone by a nearby cepheid during a pulsational cycle .",
    "when such diameter measurements are combined with radial velocity measurements of the stellar photosphere , it is possible to determine the size of and distance to the cepheid .",
    "such a direct measurement is independent of photometric observations and their associated uncertainties .",
    "the palomar testbed interferometer ( pti ) is located on palomar mountain near san diego , ca @xcite .",
    "it combines starlight from two 40-cm apertures to measure the amplitude ( a.k.a .",
    "visibility ) of the resulting interference fringes .",
    "there are two available baselines , one 110-m baseline oriented roughly north - south ( hereafter n - s ) , and one 85-m baseline oriented roughly north - southwest ( called n - w ) . in a previous paper",
    "@xcite we presented observations using pti of the cepheid @xmath1 gem . here",
    "we report on additional interferometric observations of @xmath1 gem , as well as a second galactic cepheid , @xmath0 aql .",
    "these observations allow us to determine the distances to these cepheids with the aim of reducing the uncertainty in currently used period - luminosity relations for cepheids .",
    "we observed the nearby galactic cepheids @xmath0 aql and @xmath1 gem on 22 nights between 2001 march 13 and 2001 july 26 .",
    "the observing procedure followed standard pti practice @xcite .",
    "for the observations of @xmath0 aql the n - w baseline was used , while observations of @xmath1 gem used the n - s baseline .",
    "each nightly observation consisted of approximately ten 130-second integrations during which the fringe visibility was averaged .",
    "the measurements were done in the @xmath4 m ( effective central wavelength @xmath5 m ) wavelength region , similar to the astronomical @xmath6 band .",
    "observations of calibration sources were rapidly ( within less than @xmath7 minutes ) interleaved with the cepheid observations , and after each 130-second integration the apertures were pointed to dark sky and a 30-second measurement of the background light level was made .",
    "the calibrators were selected to be located no more than 16 degrees from the primary target on the sky and to have similar @xmath6-band magnitudes . in choosing calibration sources we avoided known binary or highly variable stars .",
    "the calibrators used are listed in table [ tab : calibs ] . in this paper",
    "we make use of previously published observations of the cepheid @xmath1 gem @xcite .",
    "however , in order to improve on the previously published results we carried out additional observations of this source on 2001 march 1315 .",
    "we also observed additional unresolved calibrators in order to reduce the level of systematic uncertainty .",
    "the original data have been jointly re - reduced using the improved calibrator diameters and uncertainties .",
    "however , note that the primary calibrator diameter has not changed from the value used in @xcite .",
    "pti uses either a 10 or 20 ms sample rate .",
    "each such sample provides a measure of the instantaneous fringe visibility and phase .",
    "while the phase value is converted to distance and fed back to the active delay line to provide active fringe tracking , the measured fringe visibility is averaged over the entire 130-second integration .",
    "the statistical uncertainty in each measurement is estimated by breaking the 130 second integration into five equal - time segments and measuring the standard deviation about the mean value .",
    "the theoretical relation between source brightness distribution and fringe visibility is given by the van cittert - zernike theorem .",
    "for a uniform intensity disk model the normalized fringe visibility ( squared ) can be related to the apparent angular diameter as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the first - order bessel function , @xmath10 is the projected aperture separation , @xmath11 is the apparent angular diameter of the star in the uniform - disk model , and @xmath12 is the center - band wavelength of the observation .",
    "it follows that the fringe visibility of a point source measured by an ideal interferometer should be unity . for",
    "a more realistic model that includes limb darkening one can derive a conversion factor between a uniform - disk diameter ( @xmath11 ) and a limb - darkened disk diameter ( @xmath13 ) given by @xcite @xmath14 where a and b are quadratic limb darkening coefficients , determined by the spectral type of the source @xcite .",
    "the limb darkening correction factors ( @xmath15 ) used for the cepheids are shown in table [ tab : targ ] and for the calibrators in table [ tab : calibs ] .      the first step in calibrating visibilities measured by pti is to correct for the effects of detector background and read - noise , the details of which are discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , the visibilities thus produced are not yet final : due to a variety of effects , including systematic instrumental effects , intensity mismatches , and atmospheric turbulence , the fringe visibility of a source measured by pti is lower than that predicted by eq .",
    "1 . in practice",
    "the system response function ( called the system visibility ) is typically @xmath16 and furthermore is variable on 30 minute timescales .",
    "hence the visibilities must be calibrated by observing sources of known diameter .",
    "determining the diameter of the calibration sources was a multi - step process in which we made use of both models and prior observations .",
    "for each cepheid we designated a single , bright k giant as a primary calibrator , which was always observed in close conjunction with the target cepheid ( hd 189695 for @xmath0 aql , and hd 49968 for @xmath1 gem ) .",
    "we used model diameter estimates for the primary calibrators from previously published results based on spectro - photometry and modeling @xcite .    in order to verify that the primary calibrators were stable and had angular diameters consistent with the @xcite results , we observed them together with a number of secondary calibrators .",
    "these secondary calibrators were typically less resolved than the primary calibrators and hence less sensitive to uncertainties in their expected angular diameter .",
    "however , they were fainter than the primary calibrators , and tended to be located further away on the sky . for the secondary calibrators",
    "an apparent diameter was estimated using three methods : ( 1 ) we used available archival photometry to fit a black - body model by adjusting the apparent angular diameter , bolometric flux and effective temperature of the star in question so as to fit the photometry . ( 2 ) we repeated the above fit while constraining the effective temperature to the value expected based on the published spectral type . (",
    "3 ) we estimated the angular diameter of the star based on expected physical size ( derived from spectral type ) and distance ( determined by hipparcos ) .",
    "we adopted the weighted ( by the uncertainty in each determination ) mean of the results from the above methods as the final model diameter for the secondary calibrators , and the uncertainty in the model diameter was taken to be the deviation about the mean .",
    "in addition to the model - based diameter estimates derived above we also used extensive interferometric visibility measurements for the primary and secondary calibrators ; given that several of the calibrators were observed within a short enough period of time that the system visibility could be treated as constant , it was possible to find a set of assumed calibrator diameters that are maximally self - consistent , by comparing observed diameter ratios for which the system visibility drops out . to illustrate , let @xmath17 be an adjustable parameter , representing the diameter of star @xmath18 .",
    "let @xmath19 and @xmath20 be the theoretical model diameter and uncertainty for star @xmath18 derived above , and let @xmath21 and @xmath22 be the interferometrically observed diameter ratio and uncertainty of stars @xmath18 and @xmath23 . for notational simplicity , define @xmath24 as the ratio of @xmath17 and @xmath25 .",

    "the resulting diameter values are listed in table [ tab : calibs ] .",

    "there are two potential explanations for this effect : ( 1 ) for these observations the optical delay lines are close to their maximum range , which can exacerbate internal system misalignments and lead to vignetting .",
    "( 2 ) when observing low declination sources past transit , the siderostat orientation is such that surface damage near the edge of one of the siderostat mirrors causes vignetting .",

    "requires comparing the measured changes in angular diameter to the expansion of the cepheid photosphere measured using radial velocity techniques . in order to determine the expansion of the cepheid photospheres we fit a fifth - order fourier series to previously published radial velocities . for @xmath0 aql we used data from @xcite as well as data published by @xcite , while for @xmath1 gem we used data from @xcite",
    "both sets of data were from measurements made at optical wavelengths .",

    "we convert the radial velocity fourier series into a physical size change by integrating and multiplying by limb - darkening and p - factors . although the limb - darkening does vary with changing @xmath84 during a pulsational cycle",

    "the size change can in turn be converted into an angular size model with three free parameters : the mean physical radius , the distance to the star , and a phase shift .",
    "the latter is to account for possible period changes , inaccuracies in period or epoch , or phase lags due to level effects ( where the optical and infrared photospheres are at different atmospheric depths ; see below ) .",
    "we adjust the model phase , radius and distance to fit the observed angular diameters .",
    "results of the fits for @xmath0 aql and @xmath1 gem are given in table [ tab : result ] .",
    "there are several sources of uncertainty in the above fits : in addition to the purely statistical uncertainty there are systematic uncertainties of comparable magnitude .",
    "the three primary sources of systematic uncertainty are : uncertainty in the calibrator diameters , uncertainty in the p - factor , and uncertainty in the limb darkening coefficients .",
    "the magnitude of each effect was estimated separately by re - fitting the model while varying by @xmath86 each relevant parameter separately .",
    "the total systematic uncertainty was calculated as @xmath87    in order to explore the possibility of wavelength - dependent effects on the measured radial velocity , e.g.  due to velocity gradients in the cepheid atmospheres ( `` level effects '' ) , we re - fit for the radius and distance of @xmath0 aql using a radial velocity curve based on radial velocity data obtained at wavelengths of @xmath88 and @xmath89 m by @xcite .",
    "because of the limited number of observations available ( e.g only 3 @xmath6-band measurements of @xmath0 aql ) we used the shape of the radial velocity curve derived from the fit to the optical data ( i.e.  by using the same fourier coefficients ) ; the ir data was only used to determine an overall amplitude of the velocity curve . for the ir",
