    "recent data obtained in the experiments on @xmath0d and @xmath1he annihilation in flight at low energy  @xcite and on the measurement of the shift and the width of the 1@xmath10 level of the @xmath0d atom @xcite gave a first indication of a quite unusual phenomenon .",
    "indeed , the imaginary part of the @xmath0d scattering length appears to be smaller than the @xmath0p one  @xcite .",
    "the performed experiments were the first investigations of the @xmath0d system at low energy ; their realization was a very difficult task and the precision and accuracy obtained were limited .",
    "the first aim of this work is to combine the data coming from these experiments in order to extract improved information on the imaginary part of the @xmath0d scattering length .",
    "as we have shown in our previous paper  @xcite , devoted to the @xmath0p annihilation at low energies  @xcite , a successful analysis can be done within the scattering length approximation written for the systems with coulomb attraction .",
    "these two approaches , in - flight annihilation and antiprotonic atom experiments , were shown to give coherent results and can be used as complementary .",
    "the second aim of this work is to perform a first phenomenological analysis of the antiproton annihilation on heavier nuclei in s - wave and in p - wave .",
    "the values of the @xmath0d and @xmath1he annihilation cross sections used in this paper are reported in tab .",
    "[ t : tab1 ] .",
    "these are the only @xmath0-nucleus annihilation data available at incident momentum below 200  mev / c .",
    "the data concerning shifts and widths of antiprotonic atoms will be reported in the text .    .",
    "values of the @xmath0d and @xmath1he total annihilation cross sections used in this work , multiplied by the square of the incoming beam velocity @xmath11 for different @xmath0 incident momenta . in the data from  @xcite , in addition to the quoted statistical and systematic errors , an overall normalization error of 2.5% has to be considered .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tabvol ]    these values , as a function of the atomic weight , are presented in fig .",
    "[ scvol ] .",
    "unfortunately , the large experimental errors do not allow for an unambiguous conclusion about the form of the functional dependence .",
    "nevertheless , this function seems to have , at least , a saturation - like behaviour .",
    "an analogous question can be put forward for the d - wave .",
    "the experimental atomic information for heavy nuclei is quite abundant ( see for review @xcite ) .",
    "however , the scattering length approximation used here to extract the scattering parameter @xmath12 is no longer valid .",
    "when one works quite far from the threshold , it is necessary to take into account higher terms in the development of the @xmath13-matrix and to use an effective range approximation instead of the scattering length one .",
    "thus , the @xmath13-matrix must be written as : @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the momentum of the corresponding coulomb level : @xmath16 . for light nuclei , like hydrogen or helium , for which b = 57.6 fm and b = 18 fm respectively , a correction coming from the second term is negligible , if one supposes that @xmath17 is of the order of 1.0 fm . for heavier nuclei , for instance @xmath18f , @xmath19 fm and",
    "this value is of the same order as all other parameters in this expression .",
    "therefore , the development has no sense and the scattering parameters can not be extracted from the results of atomic experiments .",
    "note that the experiments measuring annihilation cross sections have no such problem because , in principle , any value of @xmath15 can be chosen .",
    "the proposed combined analysis of the recent @xmath0-light nucleus annihilation data and antiprotonic atom data allows our knowledge of the low energy parameters in these systems to be improved .",
    "the imaginary part of the spin - averaged @xmath0d scattering length can be obtained : @xmath20 \\mbox { fm}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] moreover , for the first time , it becomes possible to evaluate the imaginary part of the spin - averaged @xmath1he scattering length : @xmath21   \\mbox { fm}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] compared to the the imaginary part of the spin - averaged @xmath0p scattering length @xmath22   \\mbox { fm},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] obtained from annihilation data and in agreement with antiprotonic atom experiments , these values indicate the presence of a quite unexpected phenomenon : the absolute value of the scattering length seems to be a decreasing function of the atomic weight .",
    "a naive geometrical vision of @xmath0-nucleus annihilation would suggest a value of the @xmath0-nucleus scattering length increasing with the nucleus size .",
    "this naive picture is also wrong when one analyses the imaginary part of the p - wave scattering volume : the function seems to have , at least , a saturation - like behaviour .    to confirm this unusual phenomenon involving low energy @xmath0-nucleus interactions , it would be necessary to perform new measurements with higher statistics .",
    "this experimental information , expanded to heavier nuclei , could be obtained with the new ad facility at cern .",
