    "the yakutsk eas array effectively covers the energy domain from @xmath6  ev to @xmath7  ev by measuring charged particles , muons with @xmath8  gev@xmath9 and cherenkov light emission . in the same energy region two irregularities of cosmic ray ( cr ) energy spectrum are observed   the _ knee _",
    "( @xmath10  ev ) and the _ ankle _ ( @xmath11  ev ) . the nature of these irregularities is yet to be explained . from the work by",
    "@xcite it follows that such a spectrum shape could be a consequence of a transition from galactic to extragalactic components in the total cr flux , i.e. there must be some region in the cr spectrum where the intensities of these fluxes become equal to each other and then decrease .",
    "the boundaries of such a transition region is yet unknown and represents a subject of research at many large eas arrays .",
    "the physics of this phenomenon is tightly connected with particle drift in the magnetic fields of our galaxy and outer space .",
    "since nuclei of different masses behave differently in a magnetic field , then the cr composition in different points of space will differ .",
    "therefore , it is possible to solve the problem of the transitional region by measuring the cr mass composition in eas related experiments .",
    "it is a known fact that the depth of shower maximum ( @xmath0 ) and fluctuations in eas development are sensitive to the atomic number of the primary particle and for this reason they are used to estimate the cr mass composition  @xcite .",
    "it is especially important for the ultra - high energy region where direct measurements of mass composition are impracticable .",
    "for example , works by @xcite utilized single characteristics and their combinations : @xmath12 , @xmath1 and @xmath13 .",
    "these works provided initial estimations of inelastic interaction cross - sections at ultra - high energies .    in this paper",
    "we present the data on longitudinal eas development reconstructed from cherenkov emission data .",
    "these data were obtained after modernization of the yakutsk array when the accuracy of the main eas characteristics increased compared to the previous series of observations .",
    "a precise knowledge of the mass composition together with the energy spectrum plays a major role in understanding cr astrophysics  @xcite . in this sense , engaging the maximal possible number of composition - sensitive eas characteristics increases the reliability of cr chemical composition estimation .",
    "it is important to consider not only the mean eas parameters , e.g @xmath0 , muon content @xmath14 but also their fluctuations in given energy intervals  @xcite . in order to minimize the latter",
    ", it is also a good idea to analyze them at fixed energies .",
    "the determination of @xmath0 in individual showers is based on methods developed at the yakutsk array and utilize the measurements of eas cherenkov light emission at different core distances . in the first method , @xmath0 is determined by the parameter @xmath15 ( a relation of cherenkov light fluxes at @xmath16 and @xmath17  m from the core ) ; the second   involves the reconstruction of the eas development cascade curve , using the cherenkov light lateral distribution function and a reverse solving  @xcite ; the third is based on half - width and half - height of cherenkov light pulses recorded at @xmath16  m from the core ; the fourth method includes recording the cherenkov track with several detectors based on camera - obscura located at @xmath18  m from the array center  @xcite .",
    "various factors affect the methods mentioned above : the way the showers are selected , precision of core location , atmosphere transparency , mathematical methods used to calculate parameters of approximated functions , hardware - related fluctuations and so on .",
    "the influence from single and composite factors on physical results of the yakutsk array operation was calculated either with full simulation of the measurement procedure or empirically estimated during special methodical experiments .",
    "for instance , an estimation of hardware - related errors was performed by the analysis of two nearby detectors that measure charged particles , muons and cherenkov light emission  @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of @xmath0 determination in individual showers was estimated in simulating eas characteristics measurements at the array involving monte - carlo methods and amounted to @xmath19  g/@xmath20 , @xmath21  g/@xmath20 , @xmath22  g/@xmath20 , @xmath21  g/@xmath20 respectively for the first , second , third and fourth methods .",
    "the total error of @xmath0 estimation included errors associated with core location , atmospheric transparency during the observational period , hardware fluctuations and mathematical methods used to calculate main parameters .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] demonstrates a cloud of points in the @xmath0 distribution for showers with energy above @xmath23  ev .",
    "these data were obtained using all four methods and reflect an alteration of @xmath0 towards lower atmosphere depths with increasing energy .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows @xmath0 values averaged over energy intervals together with the data from other experiments . on the same picture results of different hadron models calculations",
    "are shown .",
    "all experimental data coincide within experimental errors and demonstrate an irregular shift with energy . up to @xmath24  ev e.r .",
    "has value @xmath25  g/@xmath20 and within the interval of @xmath26  ev it equals @xmath27  g/@xmath20 .",
    "this might be interpreted as a possible alteration in mass composition at very high energies .",
    "a comparison with calculations reveals a tendency for a light nuclei abundance starting from @xmath28  ev to @xmath29  ev and some abundance above @xmath29  ev .        .",
    "filled circles represent the yakutsk data , open circles   casa - mia , squares   auger data , blue triangles   preliminary results of the telescope array experiment @xcite .",
    "solid lines   results obtained with qgsjet  ii , dashed   epos  1.6 , point line   sibyll  1.62,scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "fluctuations of @xmath0 play a huge role in eas longitudinal development as they are associated with the point of first interaction ( and , hence , with the inelastic interaction cross - section , @xmath30 ) , energy transfer to secondary hadron particles ( inelastic coefficient @xmath31 ) and , to a great extent , depend on the kind of primary particle initiating a shower .",
    "so , the amount of fluctuations measured in different energy intervals could characterize the cr mass composition at a given energy and on the whole determine the dynamics of its change with the energy of the primary particle .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] demonstrates the energy dependence of @xmath1 obtained at the yakutsk array and for comparison the same figure shows the hires data  @xcite . the data from the hires experiment virtually reproduces the data from yakutsk but have a slight tendency of @xmath1 change : a small increase in the region of @xmath32  ev and a decrease at @xmath33  ev .",
    "the curves representing simulation results , obtained with qgsjet01 , qgsjet  ii and sibyll models , are also shown on this figure .",
    "calculations were performed for proton , helium nuclei , cno group and iron nuclei .",
    "comparison with experimental data has shown that the cr composition in this energy region is mixed with a dominance of protons and helium nuclei .",
    "it should be pointed out that according to figure  [ fig4 ] , the portion of heavy nuclei in the cr flux energy above @xmath34  ev is small and helium and cno - group nuclei might play a significant role .",
    "we came to the same conclusion @xcite where the shape of the @xmath0 distribution was analyzed within the framework of the qgsjet01 model at fixed energies @xmath5  ev and @xmath35  ev ( see figure  [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "distribution at fixed energy @xmath5  ev .",
    "solid line represents the yakutsk data ( @xmath36  ev , @xmath37  ev , @xmath38  events ) ; dotted line   qgsjet01 for mixed composition ( @xmath39%  p , @xmath40%  fe ) ; dashed line   qgsjet01 for primary protons , solid grey line   qgsjet01 for cno group nuclei , dash - dotted line   qgsjet01 for iron nuclei ( see  @xcite),scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] displays the mean natural logarithm of the cr atomic number @xmath41 concluded from the @xmath0 data from four experiments   yakutsk , hires , auger and telescope array @xcite . for @xmath41 derivation @xmath0 values",
    "were utilized , obtained in simulations within the framework of the qgsjet  ii models for proton and iron nuclei .",
    "the @xmath41 value was calculated according to the relation proposed by @xcite : @xmath42    at first glance , all data reveal a tendency to change @xmath41 with energy . for instance , in the energy interval @xmath43  ev , the value of @xmath41 drops from @xmath44 to @xmath45 and above @xmath5  ev a slight increase is noted .",
    "such a behaviour is close to the `` dip''-scenario from the work by @xcite , where two peaks are seen in the energy dependence of @xmath41 . the first one , at @xmath46  ev , corresponds to the ending of the galactic component , the second   at @xmath47",
    " to the start of cr intensity change due to gzk - cutoff .    however , there is still a significant data dispersion in this energy region due to poor event statistics .",
    "thus , the reliability of our statement is quite limited . for a more precise conclusion on ultra - high energy cosmic rays origin ,",
    "a few conditions must be fulfilled : improved statistics , improvement of @xmath0 estimation precision , adaptation of a single hadron interaction model that well describes experimental data and involving several alternative methods for @xmath0 evaluation .        [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "thus , according to all the data reviewed above , within the framework of the qgsjet hadron interaction model it is reasonable to speculate that the primary cosmic ray mass composition alters during the energy transition from @xmath23  ev to @xmath48  ev . at @xmath49",
    "ev @xmath50% of cosmic rays consist of protons and helium nuclei",
    ". the content of other nuclei in the region of the ankle of the spectrum does not exceed @xmath51% . a large portion of protons and helium nuclei in the primary cr near the ankle is most likely associated with a significant contribution from particles arriving from outside our galaxy . in such a case the region of transition from galactic to extragalactic component might be in the energy interval @xmath52  ev .",
    "the problem of mass composition altering above @xmath47  ev remains unresolved due to poor event statistics ."
