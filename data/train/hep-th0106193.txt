    "the properties of strongly coupled gauge theories with a sufficient amount of supersymmetry can be analyzed in great detail  @xcite .",
    "in particular , there are a number of supersymmetric gauge theories that are believed to be interconnected through a web of strong - weak coupling dualities .",
    "while these dualities provide a great deal of insight , there is still a need to study the bound states of these theories directly and at any coupling .",
    "it is well known that ( 1 + 1)-dimensional field theories _ can _ be solved from first principles via a straightforward application of discrete light - cone quantization ( dlcq )  @xcite .",
    "this includes a large class of supersymmetric gauge theories in two dimensions .",
    "more recently a supersymmetric form of dlcq ( or ` sdlcq ' ) , which is known to preserve supersymmetry , has been developed  @xcite .",
    "we have recently shown that the sdlcq algorithms can be extended to solve higher - dimensional theories  @xcite .",
    "one important difference between two - dimensional and higher - dimensional theories is the phase diagram induced by variations in the gauge coupling .",
    "the spectrum of a ( 1 + 1)-dimensional gauge theory scales trivially with respect to the gauge coupling , while a theory in higher dimensions has the potential of exhibiting a complex phase structure , which may include strong , intermediate , and weak coupling regions  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore interesting to study the properties of the bound states of gauge theories in @xmath1 dimensions in all of these regions .    towards this end",
    ", we apply sdlcq to the study of three - dimensional su(@xmath2 ) @xmath3 super - yang  mills theory compactified on the space - time @xmath0 .",
    "this extends previous work  @xcite to better numerical resolution and includes extraction of wave functions for bound states at these higher resolutions .",
    "we work in the large-@xmath2 limit , with the light - cone coordinate @xmath4 and transverse spatial coordinate @xmath5 compactified on the circles @xmath6 .",
    "as is customary in dlcq , we drop the longitudinal zero modes  .",
    "a review of dynamical and constrained zero modes can be found in  @xcite .",
    "we are able to solve for bound states and their properties numerically by diagonalizing the discretized light - cone supercharge . since we do not break the supersymmetry , the resulting spectrum is exactly supersymmetric .",
    "study of the entire spectrum , which one obtains by a complete diagonalization of the entire hamiltonian , shows that the spectrum breaks up into three distinct parts , which we will call the weak , intermediate , and strong - coupling regions .",
    "the weak - coupling region is closely related to the dimensionally reduced theory , and we have discussed it elsewhere  @xcite . by the intermediate - coupling region , we refer to the low - mass portion of the spectrum .",
    "we will see that this region clearly separates from the high - mass region for couplings beyond weak coupling .",
    "we will also see that a standard dlcq analysis of these low - mass states is only possible at intermediate coupling .",
    "we will present a detailed analysis of these states and their properties in this region .",
    "we then look at the high - mass spectrum and show that it appears to behave as a strongly coupled spectrum .",
    "unfortunately , a detailed analysis of these states requires a complete diagonalization of the hamiltonian and that is beyond the scope of this work .",

    "[ formulation ] , we summarize the formulation of su(@xmath2 ) @xmath3 super - yang  mills theory defined on the compactified space - time @xmath0 .",

    "[ numerical ] , we discuss the numerical methods that we use and present an overview of the full spectrum of the theory . in sec .",
    "[ icoupling ] , we present a detailed analysis of the states in the low - mass sector , where the sdlcq approximation is only valid up to intermediate coupling .",
    "this includes a study of the convergence of the states in both transverse and longitudinal resolutions .",

    "[ scoupling ] , we consider the other distinct sector of states",

    "this is equivalent to the choice of periodic boundary conditions in @xmath4  @xcite . for a review of ordinary dlcq ,",
    "see  @xcite . where dlcq and sdlcq differ is in the construction of the discrete @xmath20 . in dlcq",
    "this is done directly , but in sdlcq it is the supercharge that is discretized , with @xmath20 constructed from the anticommutator of @xmath28 in the supersymmetry algebra .",
    "the difference between the two discretizations disappears in the continuum limit .",
    "the advantage of the sdlcq approach is that the spectrum obtained from its discrete @xmath20 is explicitly supersymmetric at any numerical resolution , whereas the dlcq spectrum becomes supersymmetric only in the continuum limit .",
    "for additional discussion of this point , see ref .",
    "the specifics of the longitudinal discretization are presented in the following section on numerical methods .",
    "the spectrum can be classified according to three commuting @xmath40 symmetries of @xmath28 . as described in  @xcite , they are transverse parity @xmath41 the @xmath37 symmetry defined by kutasov  @xcite , which we call @xmath42 symmetry , to avoid confusion with the transverse cutoff @xmath37 , @xmath43 and the product of these two symmetries , @xmath44 .",
    "we diagonalize the supercharge separately in the four sectors defined by the four possible combinations of @xmath45 and @xmath42 eigenvalues .",
    "this significantly reduces the size of the individual matrices required for a given level of resolution .",
    "the @xmath45 symmetry is associated with a double degeneracy of the massive states , that is in addition to the usual boson / fermion degeneracy of supersymmetry .",
    "a demonstration of this is given in  @xcite .",

    "as discussed in the previous section , this is done in sdlcq by first discretizing the supercharge @xmath28 and then constructing @xmath20 from the square of the supercharge : @xmath48 .",
    "we have already introduced a finite discretization in the transverse direction , characterized by the compactification scale @xmath7 and cutoff or resolution @xmath37 . to complete the discretization of the supercharge",
    ", we introduce discrete longitudinal momenta @xmath49 as fractions @xmath50 of the total longitudinal momentum @xmath21 . here",
    "@xmath51 and @xmath52 are positive integers .",
    "it is in the nature of light - cone coordinates that the longitudinal momenta can be chosen positive , and that @xmath26 and the number of partons are bounded by @xmath52 .",
    "the integer @xmath52 determines the resolution of the longitudinal discretization and is known in dlcq as the harmonic resolution  @xcite .",
    "the remaining integrals in @xmath28 are approximated by a trapezoidal form .",
    "the continuum limit in the longitudinal direction is then recovered by taking the limit @xmath53 .    in constructing the discrete approximation we drop the longitudinal zero - momentum mode .",
    "for some discussion of dynamical and constrained zero modes , see the review  @xcite and previous work  @xcite .",
    "inclusion of these modes would be ideal , but the techniques required to include them in a numerical calculation have proved to be difficult to develop , particularly because of nonlinearities . for dlcq calculations that can be compared with exact solutions , the exclusion of zero modes does not affect the massive spectrum  @xcite . in scalar theories",
    "it has been known for some time that constrained zero modes can give rise to dynamical symmetry breaking  @xcite and work continues on the role of zero modes and near zero modes in these theories  @xcite .",
    "it is possible that a careful treatment of the dynamical zero mode of the gauge field @xmath54 could give rise to dynamical breaking of supersymmetry of the type suggested in  @xcite .",
    "our earliest sdlcq calculations  @xcite were done using a code written in mathematica and performed on a pc .",

    "the actual dimension of the fock basis as a function of the transverse and longitudinal resolutions is given in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "if only one symmetry sector is used , the dimension of the hamiltonian matrix to be diagonalized is roughly eight times smaller .",

    "in addition we see sets of trajectories with increasing masses at small @xmath65 .",
    "in fact , these trajectories with the low @xmath65 correspond to the most massive states in the entire spectrum .    in fig .",
    "[ averagenf ] we show the bound - state spectrum as a function of the average number of fermions . in spite of the fact that we are dealing with a supersymmetric theory , the average number of fermions behaves quite differently than that of the bosons .",
    "it does not appear to grow nearly as fast . in the intermediate - coupling region",
    "we saw that the number of fermions was nearly a sharp quantum number in the bound state , that is @xmath66 . in comparing the figures for @xmath60 and @xmath62 , in fig .",
    "[ averagenf ] , we see a particularly striking feature : there are no states in the range from 4 to 6 for @xmath62 .",
    "that is , all the bound states with six fermions have exactly six fermions .",
    "the interpretation of this fact is not yet clear .",
    "in this paper we present a first - principles calculation of the massive spectrum and the wave functions of @xmath3 sym theory in 2 + 1 dimensions .",
    "this is the first such calculation and will provide a benchmark for future calculations using lattice and other methods .",
    "the calculation was performed using sdlcq , which has been successfully applied to a number of ( 1 + 1)-dimensional theories .",
    "the success of this method stems from its retention of supersymmetry at every step of the numerical approximation .",
    "in our formulation this theory has three exact symmetries : supersymmetry , parity @xmath45 , and an orientation symmetry we call @xmath42 . these are all @xmath40 symmetries , and they allow us to reduce the size of the matrices in the numerical approximation by a factor of 8 .",
    "supersymmetry and parity give rise to a four - fold degeneracy which is now split between different symmetry sectors .",
    "the elimination of this four - fold degeneracy simplifies the application of the lanczos diagonalization algorithm .",
    "the theory has three dimensionful constants with the dimension of ( length)@xmath67 : @xmath68 ; @xmath39 , the transverse momentum cutoff ; and @xmath69 , the reciprocal of the length of the compact dimension .",
    "we find spectra that behave as @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 . in fig .",
    "[ full ] we see that the spectrum divides into three regions , a weak - coupling region and two bands at higher coupling .",
    "the weak - coupling region is discussed in detail in ref .",
    "there we found massless states and very light states that are totally determined by the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional theory , as well as heavier states whose masses come primarily from the transverse momentum of the constituents .",
    "these states all scale like @xmath70 .    of the two bands at higher coupling , we call the lower one the intermediate - coupling band .",
    "most of the bound states in this band are dominated by a very large number of constituents as the coupling gets strong .",
    "this fact limits the region in coupling space that we can explore using sdlcq .",
    "we have explored this region up to an intermediate coupling , and we find a well defined spectrum which converges very rapidly as we increase the transverse momentum cutoff .",
    "we also found that the transverse momentum distributions converge exceptionally well with transverse momentum cutoff .",
    "convergence in the longitudinal resolution is not as rapid as the transverse convergence , but it still appears to be well behaved .",
    "we extrapolate to infinite resolution in both the longitudinal and transverse directions and present a list of some of these states and their properties .",
    "the masses of all of these states scale like @xmath70 .",
    "it is interesting to note that , while the average number of particles grows rapidly with the coupling , this is not true for the average number of fermions .",
    "typically the states we studied in this band have precisely either zero fermions or two fermions .",
    "in fact , this is a property that persists throughout the full spectrum .",
    "it is as if each bound state has a valence number of adjoint fermions that characterizes the state .",
    "in addition to these states , there are other states in the intermediate - coupling band that we discussed previously  @xcite and have called unphysical states . the distinctive properties of these states are that the average number of particles is small and does not appear to saturate the resolution .",
    "the transverse momentum distributions are multi - humped , and the masses grow like @xmath72 and fall with increasing coupling .",
    "therefore , as we take the transverse cutoff to infinity , these states appear to decouple .",
    "it could be of some importance to find a physical meaning for these states , because they have a small average number of particles , as one might expect in a qcd - like theory , but even if their masses were to stabilize at some large transverse cutoff beyond what we currently can reach , they would be so massive that it is hard to see how they could be relevant .",
    "the only hope might be that at some very large coupling they fall back into an interesting region .    in the strong - coupling band we found states that scaled like @xmath73 at large coupling .",
    "we were motivated to look for this behavior because the supercharge is linear in the coupling .",
    "these states have multi - hump transverse momentum distributions , and their masses go like @xmath71 .",
    "we saw that some of the transverse momentum distributions have two clearly separated and symmetric humps .",
    "it is as if half of the constituents in these bound states are going one way while the other half are going the other way , leaving no constituents that are at rest relative to the center of mass of the bound state .",
    "it almost appears as though we are looking at two bound states  @xcite . if this were the case we would expect to see the same bound states elsewhere in the spectrum with a different relative transverse momentum and a different total energy .",
    "we have looked for these states but could not find them .",
    "also , this picture does not naturally seem to lead to an explanation of the linear growth of the mass with the transverse momentum cutoff .",
    "we have looked at the global properties of this strongly coupled band and found unusual behavior as a function of the average number of fermions and of the average number of particles .",
    "numerical limitations unfortunately make this band more difficult to investigate , and , while it remains possible that interesting physics might emerge from these states , the most likely result is that they decouple from the physical spectrum . we must note that we do not find states that scale as @xmath74 , which is the dependence one would expect in @xmath75 , where the coupling is the only dimensionful parameter in this finite theory .    from what we have learned about the spectrum of this theory , there appear to be three natural directions for future investigations .",
    "one is to explore the fact that all these states seem to prefer a small valence number of adjoint fermions .",
    "we might consider a supersymmetric - like theory which only has adjoint fermions .",
    "such a theory is obtained in 1 + 1 dimensions by simply dropping the boson terms in the supercharge  @xcite .",
    "one could try the same thing here .",
    "alternatively , one can decouple the bosons by adding a mass term for them .",
    "these are two simple extensions of the present work that might avoid the large number of adjoint bosons in the bound states .",
    "the third alternative is to consider a chern ",
    "simons extension of this theory .",
    "this has the advantage of maintaining exact supersymmetry and giving the constituents a mass .",
    "in addition to these three directions for the @xmath3 theory , we can consider the next class of interesting models by adding more supersymmetry .",
    "the @xmath76 theory would be particularly interesting because it is the dimensional reduction of the @xmath3 theory in 3 + 1 dimensions .",
    "this work is supported in part by the us department of energy .",

    "<S> one of the compact directions is chosen to be light - like and the other to be space - like . </S>",
    "<S> since the sdlcq regularization explicitly preserves supersymmetry , this theory is totally finite , and thus we can solve for bound - state wave functions and masses numerically without renormalizing . </S>",
    "<S> we present an overview of all the massive states of this theory , and we see that the spectrum divides into two distinct and disjoint sectors . in one sector </S>",
    "<S> the sdlcq approximation is only valid up to intermediate coupling . </S>",
    "<S> there we find a well defined and well behaved set of states , and we present a detailed analysis of these states and their properties . in the other sector , which contains a completely different set of states , we present a much more limited analysis for strong coupling only . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , while these state have a well defined spectrum , their masses grow with the transverse momentum cutoff . we present an overview of these states and their properties . </S>"
