    "since first identified by @xcite in 1981 , magnetic clouds ( mcs ) have been studied extensively in the past decades .",
    "they are large - scale organized magnetic structures in interplanetary space , developed from coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) , and play an important role in understanding the evolution of cmes from the sun to the heliosphere and the associated geoeffectiveness .",
    "the current knowledge of mcs are mostly from in - situ one - dimensional observations , and various mc fitting models have been developed to reconstruct the global picture of mcs in two or three dimensions .",
    "it is now believed that an mc is a loop - like magnetic flux rope with two ends rooting on the sun ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the modeling efforts mainly focus on two aspects .",
    "one is to reconstruct a realistic geometry and magnetic field configuration . in past decades ,",
    "mc fitting models have been developed from cylindrically symmetrical force - free flux ropes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) gradually to asymmetrically cylindrical ( non-)force - free flux ropes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and torus - shaped flux ropes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "some comparisons among various mc fitting models could be found in the papers by , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the other important aspect is to understand the expansion and distortion of the cross - section of a mc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is generally an issue about how the velocity is distributed in an mc .",
    "there are lots of observational evidence that mcs expand when propagating away from the sun ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "when the expansion is anisotropic , the initially circular cross - section of a mc will deform into a non - circular shape .",
    "the kinematic treatments and mhd simulations suggested that mcs may develop into an ellipse or ` pancake ' shape @xcite . after exploring the parameter space of flux rope models",
    ", @xcite concluded that the aspect ratio of the ellipse is around 2 , but not too large . on the other hand ,",
    "the fitting results applying an ellipse model to the observed mcs suggested that the cross - section of mcs may be not far from a circle ( see table 1 of * ? ? ?",
    "a similar result could be seen in the papers by @xcite and @xcite , who used the grad - shafranov ( gs ) technique to reconstruct mcs in a 2-dimensional plane .",
    "this technique does not constrain the shape of the mc s cross - section , but we still can find a nearly circular cross - section , particularly for the inner core .",
    "thus , it may be acceptable to assume a circular cross - section of an mc at 1 au .",
    "furthermore , expansion is only one type of the motion of the mc plasma . imagining a segment of an mc , which is approximately a cylindrical flux rope ( refer to fig.[fg_coord]b )",
    ", one may assume that there are at least three types of the global plasma motion : linear propagating motion , @xmath0 , expanding motion , @xmath1 and poloidal motion , @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath3 is the velocity in a rest reference frame , e.g. , gse coordinate system ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) , in which spacecraft movement could be ignored during the passage of an mc . @xmath1 and @xmath2 are both the speeds in a plane perpendicular to the mc s axis . by applying a cylindrical coordinate system , @xmath7 , sticking to the axis of the mc",
    ", we have @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "most of previous studies of fitting locally observed mcs simply assumed that mcs propagate radially from the sun , which means that @xmath10 .",
    "however , statistical and case studies of the propagation and geoeffectiveness of cmes suggested cme may experience a deflected propagation in interplanetary space @xcite .",
    "it will obviously provide a non - radial component of the linear propagation motion . besides",
    ", the orientation of the mc axis may probably rotate when an mc propagates in interplanetary space ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is another source of the non - radial motion .",
    "the pictures of both deflection and rotation are mainly established on indirect evidence and models .",
    "thus it is interesting to seek any signatures of non - radial motion from in - situ data .    as to the poloidal motion of plasma in mcs",
    ", there is so far no particular study .",
    "but some phenomena hint at the possible existence of such a motion .",
    "one of them is the strong field - aligned streams of suprathermal electrons in mcs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "another is the frequently observed plasma flows in prominences and coronal loops in the solar corona .",
    "prominences and coronal loops may be a part of a mc if they are involved in an eruption .",
    "if plasma poloidal motion did exist in mcs , we will shed new light on the dynamic evolution of cmes .",
    "the aim of the present work is to investigate the plasma motion of mcs from in - situ data with the aid of a flux rope model . as the first attempt",
    ", we utilize a relatively simple and ideal flux rope model , which is cylindrically symmetrical and force - free , but with all the three components of the plasma motion taken into account .",
    "one could go to the web page http://space.ustc.edu.cn/dreams/mc_fitting/ to run our model .",
    "the details of the model and method we employed in this work are described in the next section .",
    "our model is developed from the cylindrically symmetrical force - free flux rope model that has been widely used in many previous studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the following coordinate systems are used .",
    "one is the gse coordinate system , @xmath11 , in which @xmath12 is along the sun - earth ( or sun - spacecraft ) line pointing toward the sun , @xmath13 is a northward vector perpendicular to the ecliptic plane and @xmath14 completes the right - handed coordinate system .",
    "another is a cylindrical coordinate system in the mc frame , @xmath7 , with @xmath15 along the axis of the flux rope , as illustrated by figure  [ fg_coord]a . sometimes to show the pattern of magnetic field and velocity ,",
    "one more cartesian coordinates in the mc frame , @xmath16 , is used , in which @xmath17 is identical with @xmath15 , @xmath18-axis is the projection of the observational path on the plane perpendicular to @xmath17 , approximately directed toward the earth and @xmath19 completes the right - hand coordinate system ( see fig.[fg_vcircase1]e and @xmath20 ) .",
    "the magnetic field of a cylindrical flux rope is described by @xcite solution in the coordinates @xmath7 @xmath21 in which @xmath22 is the handedness or sign of the helicity , @xmath23 is the magnetic field strength at the axis , @xmath24 is the constant force - free factor , and @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the bessel functions of order 0 and 1 , respectively . like common treatment",
    ", we set the boundary of a flux rope at the first zero point of @xmath25 , which leads to @xmath27 and @xmath28 is therefore the radius of the flux rope .",
    "if any kinematic evolution of the flux rope could be ignored , the magnetic field profile along an observational path is determined once the following six parameters are known : ( 1 ) the orientation of the flux rope s axis , i.e. , the @xmath15-aixs , which is given by the elevation and azimuthal angles , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , in gse coordinate system ; @xmath31 is in the ecliptic plane and @xmath31 and @xmath32 is toward the sun , ( 2 ) the closest approach ( ca ) of the observational path to the flux rope s axis , given by @xmath33 in units of @xmath28 ; a positive / negative value of @xmath33 means that the observational path is above / below the axis in @xmath16 coordinates , i.e. , @xmath34/@xmath35 as shown by the examples of the positive @xmath33 in fig.[fg_vcircase1]e and [ fg_vcircase2]e , and ( 3 ) the free parameters in eq.[eq_b1][eq_b3 ] , which are @xmath36 , @xmath23 and @xmath28 .",
    "after the possible plasma motion is taken into account , five additional parameters should be considered , which are @xmath37 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 . here",
    "we assume that the flux rope propagates and expands uniformly and experiences a quasi - steady , self - similar expansion ( or contraction ) during the period of interest .",
    "thus , @xmath3 is a constant vector , describing a global linear motion , that does not change the internal magnetic field of the flux rope .",
    "the parameter @xmath1 is a constant expansion speed of the boundary of the cross - section of the flux rope .",
    "the self - similar assumption gives the expansion speed at any radial distance , @xmath38 , away from the flux rope s axis as @xmath39 in which @xmath40 is the normalized radial distance , equal to @xmath41 . as a consequence , the radius of the cross - section of the flux rope evolves as follows @xmath42 in which @xmath43 is the initial time ( or the time the observer first encountering the mc flux rope ) , and the magnetic field as @xmath44 ^ 2 \\label{eq_flux_cons}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] eq.[eq_flux_cons ] follows the magnetic flux conservation .",
    "it should be noted that , due to the curvature of the whole looped flux rope , the propagation velocity of the different segment of the flux rope is along the different direction as illustrated in figure  [ fg_coord]b , which may actually cause the expansion along the axis of the flux rope .",
    "that is also why the length of the flux rope increases as indicated by eq.[eq_rl ] below .",
    "the axial expansion rate could be on the same order of the expansion rate of the flux rope s cross - section ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which guarantee a roughly self - consistent evolution of a force - free flux rope @xcite .    under the assumption of self - similar expansion and the conservations in both mass and angular momentum ,",
    "the poloidal speed in the flux rope can be derived ( see appendix [ app_poloidal ] ) as @xmath45 in which @xmath46 is a constant and @xmath47 is a function dependent only on the relative position @xmath40 .",
    "however , the expression of @xmath47 can not be specified theoretically . as the first attempt",
    ", here we tentatively assume @xmath48 .",
    "it should be noted that the point at @xmath49 is a singularity under this assumption because @xmath50 has a non - zero value that is not physically meaningful .",
    "we just ignore this singularity , and as will be seen in sec.[sec_cir ] , we prove that this assumption can be treated as an acceptable approximation",
    ". then eq.[eq_vphi ] can be rewritten as @xmath51 where the parameter @xmath52 defines the poloidal speed of the plasma at the boundary of the flux rope in the direction of @xmath53 .      in summary ,",
    "table  [ tb_para ] lists all the 11 free parameters in the velocity - modified cylindrical force - free flux rope model . besides , based on the cylindrical force - free flux rope assumption",
    ", we may derive more parameters , which have been also summarized in table  [ tb_para ] .",
    "it is straightforward to obtain the first two derived parameters , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the next four parameters are derived as follows .    the axial magnetic flux , @xmath56 , is given by @xmath57 in which @xmath58 and @xmath59 is the first zero point of bessel function @xmath25 .",
    "the poloidal magnetic flux , @xmath60 , is given by @xmath61 in which @xmath62 is the length of the loop as denoted in figure  [ fg_coord]a and @xmath63 .",
    "the helicity , @xmath64 , is given by ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath65 in which @xmath66 is a vector potential of @xmath67 and @xmath68dx=0.701 $ ] .",
    "the magnetic energy , @xmath69 , is given by @xmath70 in which @xmath71 m h@xmath72 .",
    "we do not know the value of @xmath62 , but we may assume that it is bounded between @xmath73 and @xmath74 , @xmath75 is the heliocentric distance of the flux rope , as shown in figure  [ fg_coord]a . in practice , we let @xmath76 the uncertainty , @xmath77 , in the length of the flux rope will result in the uncertainty in @xmath60 , @xmath64 and @xmath69 . it should be noted that ( 1 ) the uncertainty here is not from the fitting procedure but the length of the flux rope , and ( 2 ) this treatment will underestimate the real length if the leg of an mc rather than its leading part was observed .    considering the conservation of magnetic flux , we may infer from eq.[eq_fluxz ] and [ eq_fluxp ] that @xmath78 and consequently , the helicity is conserved too .",
    "further , we may infer @xmath79 , suggesting that magnetic energy continuously decreases when an mc propagates away from the sun . in this work",
    ", we calculate its initial value , @xmath80 , as listed in table  [ tb_para ] , which is the magnetic energy when the mc is only one solar radius away from the sun , and the associated uncertainty of about @xmath81 comes from the uncertainty in @xmath62 .",
    "be aware that the decay index of the magnetic energy of an mc may not be @xmath82 .",
    "the case study by @xcite , for example , has shown that the decay index for the mc observed by two spacecraft at 1 and 5.4 au , respectively , on 1998 march is about @xmath83 , a little bit slower than the expectation from our model .",
    "if the decay index varies from @xmath83 to @xmath84 , the extrapolated @xmath80 suffers an additional uncertainty of about @xmath85 , which we do not taken into account in our model .",

    "[ tb_para ]    the last derived parameter , @xmath94 , is used to evaluate the goodness - of - fit , which will be introduced in the following section .",
    "our fitting procedure is designed to fit the observed magnetic field , @xmath96 , and velocity , @xmath97 , together , which means that all the three components of @xmath96 and @xmath97 are used to constrain the model parameters .",
    "there are 11 free parameters , among which three of them are time - dependent ( see table  [ tb_para ] ) and can be determined by eq.[eq_rt ] , [ eq_flux_cons ] and [ eq_vp ] . here",
    ", we use the first contact of the mc , @xmath43 , as the reference time .",
    "the detailed fitting process is as follows .",
    "first , by given a set of 11 free parameters , the imaginarily observational path relative to the axis of the flux rope can be derived from the orientation of the axis , @xmath98 , the closest approach , @xmath33 , the propagation velocity , @xmath99 , and the expansion speed , @xmath100 .",
    "second , the coordinates of the observational path are then transformed from the gse coordinate system to the mc frame , @xmath7 . in the mc frame",
    ", the three components of magnetic field along the path can be determined by eq.[eq_b1][eq_b3 ] , in which the free parameters @xmath23 , @xmath28 and @xmath36 are involved , and the velocity can be calculated as @xmath101 , in which @xmath102 and @xmath103 are given by eq.[eq_vr ] and [ eq_vp ] .",
    "third , we transform the derived magnetic field , @xmath104 , and velocity , @xmath105 , in the mc frame back to the gse coordinate system , and evaluate the goodness - of - fit by calculating the normalized root mean square ( rms ) of the difference between the modeled and observed values of magnetic field and velocity , which is given as @xmath106}\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}(\\chi_{bn}^2+\\chi_{vn}^2 ) } \\label{eq_chi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath107 is the number of measurements , and @xmath108 is a reference velocity .    to find the best - fit , we use the idl package , mpfit ( refer to http://purl.com/net/mpfit ) , to perform least - squares fitting @xcite .",
    "the initial value of @xmath109 is set to be the maximum value of the magnetic field strength during the interval of interest , the initial value of @xmath110 is estimated as @xmath111 , in which @xmath112 is the duration of the mc interval and @xmath113 is the mean value of the observed @xmath89 , the initial value of the propagation velocity @xmath114 is the mean value of the observed velocity , the initial value of the expansion speed is estimated from the slope of the observed radial velocity , and the initial value of the poloidal speed is set to be zero . for the free parameter @xmath36 , we just fix its value to @xmath88 or @xmath82 by adding a loop in our fitting procedure .",
    "the elevation and azimuthal angles , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , are two most important free parameters . in order to get the best fitting result , we test the initial value of @xmath29 every @xmath115 from @xmath116 to @xmath117 , and do the same thing for @xmath30 from @xmath118 to @xmath119 .",
    "besides , we assume that the front and rear boundaries of an observed mc define the interval of the flux rope , and then the closest approach , @xmath33 , could be uniquely determined based on the preset velocity and the axis orientation of the flux rope . in summary , we try 576 attempts of fitting ( i.e. , 576 sets of the initial values of the free parameters ) for an mc , and select the case with the smallest value of @xmath94 as the best - fit .    the reference velocity in eq.[eq_chi ]",
    "is used to adjust the weight of the velocity in evaluating the goodness - of - fit , and is set as @xmath120 if there was no reference velocity , @xmath121 and @xmath122 may not have the same weight and can not be inserted into one formula , because the dynamic range of the velocity is much different from that of the magnetic field .",
    "for example , assuming an mc interval during which the magnetic field varies from 5 to 35 nt and the velocity varies from 300 to 600 km s@xmath72 , and at a given point @xmath123 nt , @xmath124 nt , @xmath125 km s@xmath72 and @xmath126 km s@xmath72 , we can get that the relative error between the modeled and observed values in magnetic field is @xmath127 and that in velocity is @xmath128 .",
    "the values of the relative errors are different .",
    "but if considering the range of 30 nt in magnetic field and the range of 300 km s@xmath72 in velocity , one can find that the relative difference between the modeled and observed values in magnetic field is the same as that in velocity .",
    "thus the value of relative error depends on the dynamic range . to remove this effect",
    ", we use the reference velocity , which is 250 km s@xmath72 in the above case .",
    "the corrected relative error of the velocity becomes @xmath129 , the same as that of the magnetic field . after this treatment , @xmath121 and @xmath122",
    "can be fitted into one formula , eq.[eq_chi ] , to assess the goodness - of - fit .",
    "the normalized rms , @xmath94 , has a definite meaning here .",
    "it measures the average relative error of modeled vectors , @xmath67 and @xmath130 , with both length and direction taken into account .",
    "it should be noted that the normalized rms here is different from those used in some studies .",
    "for example , in @xcite and @xcite , @xmath96 and @xmath104 are normalized by the strength of themselves , and that rms merely reflects the average deviation of vector directions ; while in @xcite , @xmath96 and @xmath104 are normalized by the maximum value of observed @xmath131 during the whole interval of the flux rope , which might imply that a stronger mc has a smaller value of rms .",
    "the mc list compiled by  @xcite is the basis of this study , and hereafter we call it lepping list ( see http://lepmfi.gsfc.nasa.gov/mfi/mag_cloud_s1.html ; the list including the fitted parameters are kept being updated until 2011 december 13 ) .",
    "we use this list not only because it is well established but also because we can test the procedure of our model by comparing our fitting results with @xcite results .",
    "there are a total of 121 mcs in the list .",
    "the start time , end time and model - derived parameters are all given in the list .",
    "the goodness - of - fit is estimated by @xmath132 , which is 1 , 2 or 3 for good , fair and poor , respectively .",
    "our study only considers the mcs in the first two categories .",
    "it is noticed that there are large data gaps in the published wind data during 2000 july 15  16 .",
    "their event no.45 and 46 are in that period , and are therefore removed from our study . besides , the event no.85 in their list was studied by @xcite , and is believed to consist of two mcs .",
    "thus we discard this event too .",
    "finally , a total of 72 events are available for our study as listed in table  [ tb_parbv1][tb_parbv3 ] in appendix [ app_tables ] .",
    "to test our procedure , we switch off the velocity option in our model , and compare the fitted parameters with those given in lepping list . when fitting an observed mc with our model , we use the time - resolution of the wind data as the same as that indicated in the list , which is 15 minutes for some events and 30 minutes for others .",
    "the front and rear boundaries of the mcs given in lepping list are used and fixed in our model .",
    "it is different from the procedure taken by @xcite , in which the preset boundaries may be modified by their model .",
    "the difference between their fitted and observed boundaries is evaluated by the parameters , ck and asf , given in their list ( see eq.7 and 9 in @xcite for their definitions ) .",
    "larger values of ck and asf mean larger difference .",
    "thus to make a mostly reliable comparison , we further tentatively exclude events whose ck or asf is larger than 10% , that results in a sample of 23 events .",
    "it should be noted that those excluded events will be included again in the next section though they are not used for testing our procedure here .",
    "the parameters characterizing the configuration and strength of an mc are compared , which are @xmath36 , @xmath23 , @xmath28 , @xmath33 , and orientation ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) of an mc .",
    "figure  [ fg_errlepping ] shows the differences of the values between the parameters from our and @xcite procedures .",
    "it is found that both of them suggest the same sign of helicity , @xmath36 , for each mc ( fig .",
    "[ fg_errlepping]e ) . for @xmath23 and @xmath28",
    ", we calculate the relative difference , @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is from our results and @xmath135 from lepping list .",
    "our procedure gets very similar results with lepping list ( fig.[fg_errlepping]a and [ fg_errlepping]b ) .",
    "there are only 3 events , in which the relative difference in @xmath23 and @xmath28 is outside of @xmath136% . for @xmath33 , we do not use the above equation to calculate the relative difference , because @xmath33 is",
    "a ratio of the closest approach to the radius of the flux rope and its value could be zero which may cause the value of the relative difference to be extremely large .",
    "instead , we directly use the difference of absolute values of them , @xmath137 .",
    "a good agreement also can be obtained between the two procedures ( fig.[fg_errlepping]c ) .",
    "the two parameters @xmath29 and @xmath30 , which define the orientation of a flux rope s axis , are compared together .",
    "we calculate the angle between the orientation derived by our procedure and that given in lepping list .",
    "it is found that the angle is smaller than @xmath138 , and for most ( 19 out of 23 ) events , the angle is less than @xmath139 .",
    "overall , the comparison shows that our procedure can almost reproduce the results derived by @xcite , confirming the validity of our procedure .",
    "now we switch on the velocity option , and apply the model to the 72 high - quality events in lepping list .",
    "the time - resolution of the data input into our model is set to 10 minutes .",
    "all the parameters derived from our fitting procedure of these events have been listed in table [ tb_parbv1][tb_parbv3 ] in appendix [ app_tables ] for reference . in the following two sections",
    ", we will evaluate the effects of velocity on the goodness - of - fit , and show the statistical properties of plasma motion .",
    "the goodness - of - fit is evaluated by the average relative error , @xmath94 , given by eq.[eq_chi ] .",
    "for all the 72 events , the distribution of @xmath94 has been displayed in figure  [ fg_chi]a .",
    "it is found that the values of @xmath94 are all less than 60% , and on average , @xmath94 is about 28% .",
    "further , the comparison between the cases of velocity - on and velocity - off shows that considering velocity may get the value of @xmath121 larger or smaller ( see fig.[fg_chi]b ) . as examples ,",
    "figure  [ fg_casebv]a and [ fg_casebv]b show two cases ; for one of them the fitting to the magnetic field gets worse , and for the other , the fitting looks better . in a typical mc measurements ,",
    "a declining velocity means the expansion of the mc and as a consequence , the magnetic field strength of the mc should decrease as well .",
    "the former case does not follow the picture . the strongest magnetic field appeared in the rear part of the mc , but the velocity profile indicates a clear expansion , suggesting that the strongest magnetic field should appeared in the front part of the mc .",

    "all the mcs are less than 0.25 au , and its median value is about 0.09 au .",
    "note , the values of the above two parameters are all adopted at the time , @xmath54 , when the observer arrives at the closest approach to the mc axis .",
    "the angle between the mc axis and the sun - spacecraft line , @xmath55 , could be any value from @xmath118 to @xmath117 .",
    "the most probable angle is within @xmath141 , and the median angle is about @xmath142 .",
    "it suggests that observed mcs are more likely to transversely cross over the observer .",
    "the elevation angle of the mc axis tends to be small , with a median value of about @xmath115 , implying low tilt angles of flux ropes when they erupted from the sun .",
    "further by using the total length of the flux rope , @xmath62 , given by eq.[eq_length ] , we estimate that the total magnetic flux , which includes axial flux and poloidal flux , is on the order of @xmath143 mx with the median value of about @xmath144 mx .",
    "the distributions of the axial flux and poloidal flux are also indicated by dotted and dashed lines ( fig.[fg_mcprop]e ) .",
    "their median values are @xmath145 and @xmath146 mx , respectively .",
    "the estimation of the magnetic flux of mcs were made before by , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . in @xcite , for example , eight well - defined mcs were investigated and it was found that the axial flux is around @xmath145 mx , highly consistent with the result obtained here .",
    "our results are also roughly in agreement with previous studies about the magnetic flux of mcs and reconnection flux of solar eruptions by , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the helicity is shown in figure  [ fg_mcprop]f and [ fg_mcprop]h .",
    "the number of right - handed mcs is almost equal to the number of left - handed mcs , and the absolute value of the helicity is about @xmath147 mx@xmath148 on average .",
    "for the 8 events studied by @xcite , the helicity per unit length is about @xmath149 mx@xmath148/au . according to eq.[eq_length ] ,",
    "the helicity in their study is about @xmath150 mx@xmath148 , consistent with the average value we obtained here .",
    "moreover , the initial magnetic energy is found to be about @xmath151 erg , nearly one order higher than the kinetic energy of a typical cme , which is about @xmath152 erg ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , even considering the uncertainty in the decay index when we extrapolate the initial magnetic energy .        @xcite compared the static and expansion models and found that the modeled values of the mc parameters are not changed too much .",
    "here we consider not only the expansion but also other types of motion .",
    "will the values of parameters change more significantly ? by comparing the values of the fitting parameters obtained from the velocity - modified and non - velocity models as shown in figure  [ fg_errbv ] , we find that the values are more or less changed , but not too significantly except the orientation .",
    "the magnetic field strength is almost unaffected .",
    "for the radius , about 13% ( 9 out of 72 ) of the events get a smaller value after velocity is taken into account , and about 10% of the events get a larger value .",
    "for the closest approach , the velocity - modified model believes that the observer should be slightly farther away from the mc axis for 8 events and closer for only 4 events .",
    "the largest difference appears in the orientation .",
    "there are about 40% of the events , for which the orientation is changed by more than @xmath115 , and particularly , there are 6 events with the difference in orientation larger than @xmath153 . besides , for two cases , the handedness is also changed .",
    "one important implication to consider the velocity in fitting procedure is to reveal the properties of the plasma motion of mcs .",
    "first , we investigate the axial component , @xmath154 , and perpendicular component , @xmath155 , of the linear propagating motion of an mc .",
    "the former is a velocity along the mc s axis , i.e. , in the @xmath156-direction of the mc frame , and the latter is a velocity perpendicular to the radial direction , i.e. , the sun - spacecraft line , @xmath157 .",
    "the ratio of the axial velocity to the radial velocity , @xmath158 , as a function of the orientation of the mc s axis is shown in figure  [ fg_vaxis]a . a very nice correlation between them",
    "could be found .",
    "when the axis is almost aligned with sun - spacecraft line , the absolute value of @xmath154 is almost equal to that of @xmath89 , and when the axis becomes more and more perpendicular to the sun - spacecraft line , @xmath154 approaches zero . it well follows the cosine function as indicated by the solid line .",
    "the small deviation away from the cosine function is no more than @xmath159 , which corresponds to a very small speed on the order of 10 km s@xmath72 .",
    "this result suggests that the apparent axial velocity is mostly a consequence of the propagation of the mc though an insignificantly pure - axial flow might exist inside an mc .",
    "the distribution of @xmath155 is given in figure  [ fg_vperp ] .",
    "panel ( a ) shows that except 6 events , all the other events have a perpendicular velocity less than 60 km s@xmath72 , and panel ( b ) suggests that in 61 ( about 85% of ) events the perpendicular velocity is no more than 10% of radial velocity .",
    "a noteworthy thing is that some events have a significantly perpendicular velocity with respect to the radial velocity .",
    "the mc shown in figure  [ fg_casebv]b is an example , which occurred on 1998 september 25 .",
    "our model infers that the orientation of the mc axis is @xmath160 and @xmath161 , and the plasma motion of the mc is the combination of the linear motion at @xmath162 , 95 and 50 km s@xmath72 in @xmath12 , @xmath14 and @xmath13 directions and the expansion and poloidal motion at 90 and @xmath163 km s@xmath72 , respectively .    considering the expansion of the whole looped structure as shown in figure  [ fg_coord]b and that there is no significantly pure - axial flow inside an mc , one may find that a significantly perpendicular velocity may be present if not the front part ( or the apex ) but the flank ( or the leg ) of the mc was detected locally . which part of a looped mc is detected by spacecraft could be roughly inferred from the orientation of the mc axis .",
    "we think that the apex of an mc is encountered if the inferred axis of the mc is almost perpendicular to the sun - spacecraft line , and the leg is encountered if the axis is almost parallel to the sun - spacecraft line .",
    "thus , if the expansion of the whole looped structure was the reason of the presence of the perpendicular velocity , we may expect a very small perpendicular velocity for those apex - encountered events .",
    "figure  [ fg_vaxis]b shows the scatter plot of @xmath164 versus @xmath55 .",
    "obviously , there is no dependence of the perpendicular velocity on the axis orientation . for those events with @xmath55 close to @xmath117",
    ", the perpendicular velocity could be larger than 10% of the radial velocity .",
    "thus , there must be some other reasons for the significantly perpendicular motion .",
    "we think that the presence of a significantly perpendicular velocity might be an in - situ evidence of deflected propagation of a cme in interplanetary space ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the positive value of @xmath90 of the 1998 september 25 event suggests an eastward deflection in the ecliptic plane .",
    "this is in agreement with the proposed picture by @xcite that a cme faster than background solar wind will be deflected toward the east .",
    "if a cme propagated in interplanetary space with a perpendicular velocity at a tenth of the radial velocity , i.e. , @xmath165 , the deflection angle is then given by @xmath166 assuming @xmath167 au and @xmath168 less than 5 solar radii , we can estimate that the deflection angle is more than @xmath169 .",
    "this is quite consistent with our recent case study of a cme , which was found to be deflected by more than @xmath169 on its way from the corona to 1 au @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the perpendicular velocity might also be the result of the rotation of the whole structure of a cme with respect to the radial direction in interplanetary space , just as the rotation in the middle and outer corona ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .",
    "the distribution of the expansion speed is shown in figure  [ fg_vexp]a .",
    "it is noteworthy that a significant fraction ( about 26% ) of the events experienced a contraction process with a median value of about 12 km s@xmath72 .",
    "we check the large contraction events having @xmath170 km s@xmath72 , and find unsurprisingly that they were all caused by the overtaking of faster solar wind stream , as illustrated by the example in figure  [ fg_contraction ] . in that event ,",
    "the solar wind speed after the trailing edge of the mc is much larger than that before the leading edge , which cause the magnetic field strength increase with time , and reach the maximum near the rear boundary . under this circumstance ,",
    "the mc can not expand freely , but will be compressed by ambient solar wind .",
    "our model suggests that the contraction speed of the mc is about 27 km s@xmath72 .    .",
    "]        for the rest of the events suggested to be expanding at 1 au , the median speed is about 21 km s@xmath72 .",
    "the expansion substantially depends on the balance between the internal and external forces .",
    "the internal force is partially characterized by magnetic field strength .",
    "figure  [ fg_vexp]b shows the correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath23 .",
    "the black dashed line is the linear fitting to all the data points and the blue solid line is the linear fitting to the data points of @xmath171 ( blue dots ) .",
    "a weak correlation could be found , but it is not significantly different between all data points and data points of @xmath171 .",
    "the correlation coefficient is not so high , because the external condition is not considered . with the increasing distance away from the sun , both the magnetic and thermal pressures in the solar wind usually decrease .",
    "it will consequently cause the unbalance between the internal and external forces , which drives a cme / mc expanding .",
    "thus we may expect that the expansion speed should be correlated with propagation speed .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fg_vexp]c , there does exist a stronger correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath89 for expansion events .",
    "the correlation coefficient is about 0.55 .",
    "it is consistent with the previous result by , e.g. , @xcite that rapid decrease of the total solar wind pressure with heliocentric distance is the main driver of the mc expansion .",
    "similar results could also be found for the events in the inner and outer heliosphere @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", the mc expansion could be classified as self - similar expansion , overexpansion and underexpansion .",
    "note , the term ` self - similar ' here only refers to that the radius , @xmath28 , of an mc evolves proportionally to the distance @xmath75 , which is a subset of that defined in sec.2.1 where ` self - similar ' means that not only the size but also the internal plasma parameters of the mc evolve self - similarly .",
    "imaging data have suggested that most cmes undergo a self - similar expansion in the outer corona ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but whether or not they maintain the self - similar expansion in interplanetary space ? to measure the expansion rate of mcs , @xcite used a dimensionless quantity @xmath172 , in which @xmath173 is the difference of the measured solar wind speed along the sun - spacecraft line between the front and rear boundaries of an mc .",
    "they found that the value of @xmath174 is about 0.7 after analyzing all the mcs observed by helios spacecraft .",
    "considering @xmath173 is a proxy of the expansion speed of an mc and @xmath175 approximates the size of the mc , we may infer that @xmath176 , and @xmath177 means an underexpansion .",
    "thus , the parameter , @xmath174 , has the same physical meaning of the power index , @xmath178 , appearing in the power law of the heliocentric distance dependence of the cme / mc size ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , namely @xmath179 , where @xmath180 is the mc size and @xmath181 is a constant .",
    "@xcite found @xmath182 and @xcite gave @xmath183 .",
    "here we use model derived parameters to investigate the expansion rate again . since all the mcs in this study located at 1 au",
    ", we have @xmath184 au .",
    "figure  [ fg_vexp]d shows the plot of @xmath185 versus @xmath186au .",
    "the self - similar expansion is given by the dashed line .",
    "the data points above the line suggest an overexpansion , and those below the line a underexpansion . by considering a 20% uncertainty as indicated by the two dotted lines , we find that only 21% of the events underwent a nearly self - similar expansion , and 62%/17% of the events have and expansion rate lower / larger than 0.8/1.2 . by using a function of @xmath187 to fit the all these data points as indicated by the solid line ,",
    "we get @xmath188 on average , generally consistent with that obtained by , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , if the uncertainty is considered . a possible reason of why the expansion rate is significantly below unity",
    "is that the mcs are perturbed by ambient solar wind and/or other transients as shown in observational statistics @xcite , which may cause the external pressure surrounding the mc decreasing with distance more slowly than usual .",
    "the numerical simulations by , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite also suggested that cme - cme interaction may affect the expansion rate of the preceding cme .",
    "it should be noted that in our model the expansion speed is derived based on the measured solar wind velocity along the sun - spacecraft line and therefore the expansion speed here is more likely to reflect the radial expansion rather than lateral expansion .",
    "lots of studies have shown that the cross - section of a cme will more or less distorted from the circular shape to a pancake shape ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting that the lateral expansion is probably faster than the radial expansion .",
    "thus , the lateral expansion may probably still be self - similar as that in the outer corona though the radial expansion is not .",
    "one may notice that our model implies that @xmath189 , meaning a self - similar expansion ( see sec.[sec_para ] ) .",
    "it is inconsistent with the result here .",
    "this inconsistency may come from various sources , e.g. , the assumption of the magnetic flux and/or helicity conservation , the assumption of @xmath190 , and the assumption of the uniformly straight cylindrical geometry .",
    "it will consequently affect the values of some derived parameters , e.g. , @xmath60 , @xmath64 and @xmath69 .",
    "although such an inconsistency exists , we think that the values of these derived parameters still could be treated as a first - order approximation .",
    "the distribution of poloidal speed is shown in figure  [ fg_vcir ] .",
    "the median value is about 10 km s@xmath72 . by comparing the poloidal speed with other parameters",
    ", we can not find any significant correlation among them ( all the correlation coefficients are no more than 0.40 ) . obviously , the poloidal speed , if any , is less significant than the expansion speed on average .",
    "this fact may cause the observational signature of the poloidal motion in an mc unclear . to",
    "most clearly show the poloidal motion , we choose the events without significant expansion and convert the velocity into the cartesian frame , @xmath16 , of the mc ( see sec.[sec_model1 ] for the definition of the coordinates ) .",
    "a nice example is shown in figure  [ fg_vcircase1 ] , which was observed on 2009 october 12 .",
    "the two vertical lines mark the beginning and the end of the mc , and the fitting results are given by the red curves in figure  [ fg_vcircase1]a . according to the modeled parameters ,",
    "the path of wind spacecraft in the mc frame is shown in figure  [ fg_vcircase1]e . along the path from the beginning to the end of the mc , the rotation of the magnetic field vector is well presented in both the @xmath191 and @xmath192 planes ( see fig.[fg_vcircase1]b and [ fg_vcircase1]c ) .",
    "the color - coded dots are observations and the color - coded lines are fitting curves .",
    "more interestingly , the poloidal motion is evident in the mc frame ( fig.[fg_vcircase1]d ) . in this event ,",
    "the expansion speed is almost zero and the poloidal speed is about @xmath193 km s@xmath72 at time of @xmath54 .",
    "figure  [ fg_vcircase2 ] shows another event on 2003 march 20 , in which the modeled poloidal speed is @xmath194 km s@xmath72 , more significant than the modeled expansion speed of about @xmath195 km s@xmath72 , and therefore the poloidal motion can be also recognized in observations .",
    "based on the model , we could expect that the data points of velocity will form an arc which is symmetric about the axis of @xmath196 if the poloidal motion was significant and dominant in an mc .",
    "the above two cases just show the pattern .",
    "however , the arc s symmetrical axis will change to @xmath197 if the expansion was significant and dominant .",
    "figure  [ fg_vscatter]a roughly shows the case , which was observed during 1998 november 8  10 and the values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 are 69 and @xmath198 km s@xmath72 , respectively",
    ". if both expansion and poloidal motion are significant , the ` symmetric ' axis will rotate , and the velocity data points may deviate slightly from a symmetric distribution .",
    "the 2001 april 4  5 event shown in figure  [ fg_vscatter]b is an example to show the change .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath47 in the equation of poloidal speed ( eq.[eq_vphi ] ) is assumed to be unity . whether or not is this assumption reasonable ?",
    "we check it by investigating the correlation between @xmath199 and @xmath40 as shown in figure  [ fg_k2 ] .",
    "@xmath103 is derived from velocity measurements in the mc frame , and @xmath28 are obtained from model results .",
    "@xmath46 is an unknown constant , that may change from one event to another .",
    "we determine the value of @xmath46 by making the value of @xmath47 of most data points around unity .",
    "all the data points of the 72 events are plotted together to show the statistical trend ( fig.[fg_k2]a ) .",
    "the red diamonds in the figure are the mean values of the data points in the bins with a horizontal size of @xmath200 , and the error bars indicate the standard deviations .",
    "the blue line gives @xmath48 .",
    "it is clear that data points are generally distributed around the blue line no matter which value @xmath40 is , though a large scattering is evident , suggesting that @xmath48 is an appropriate assumption from the view of statistics .",
    "however , the form of @xmath47 is case dependent . is the assumption of @xmath48 generally appropriate for an individual mc ?",
    "it is further checked in figure  [ fg_k2]b[fg_k2]h , in which the dependence of @xmath47 on @xmath40 for 7 selected mcs are presented .",
    "these 7 mcs are selected for investigation because ( 1 ) the derived poloidal speed is significant , larger than 10 km s@xmath72 , and ( 2 ) the closest approach is smaller than @xmath201 so that there is a complete scan of @xmath40 .",
    "for different events , the pattern is indeed different . figure  [ fg_k2]b and",
    "[ fg_k2]h suggest a general increase of @xmath47 with increasing @xmath40 , figure  [ fg_k2]d and [ fg_k2]f show that @xmath47 has a unimodal distribution , and figure  [ fg_k2]c , [ fg_k2]e and [ fg_k2]g show a reversed unimodal distribution of @xmath47 . if considering the errors , we find that @xmath47 is almost independent on @xmath40 for all the cases except the last one ( fig.[fg_k2]h ) . even for the last case , @xmath47 is almost invariant for @xmath202 .",
    "thus , based on the above analysis , we may treat the simplest assumption , @xmath48 , as an acceptable approximation .",
    "in this paper , we present a velocity - modified cylindrical force - free flux rope model in details .",
    "both observations of in - situ magnetic field and plasma velocity are taken into account by our model to derive the geometrical and kinematic parameters of mcs , which have been summarized in table  [ tb_para ] .",
    "the validity of our fitting procedure and the effect of velocity on the fitting results are checked through the lepping list .",
    "it is found that the values of the modeled radius and orientation of an mc and the closest approach are more likely to be changed significantly if the velocity is considered . in our sample , the radius changes its value by more than 20% in 22% of the cases , orientation changes by more than 30@xmath203 in 15% , and the closest approach changes by more than 20% in 17% . in a few cases ,",
    "the handedness may also be changed .",
    "we then obtain the statistical properties of mcs , including the magnetic field strength , radius , orientation , magnetic flux , helicity and initial magnetic energy , which have been summarized in figure  [ fg_mcprop ] .",
    "furthermore , some findings about the plasma motion of mcs are obtained .    1 .",
    "the linear propagation velocity may not be along the radial direction",
    ". the value of the non - radial component of the propagation velocity could be more than 10% of radial speed in some cases , which constitutes the direct evidence of the deflected propagation and/or rotation of a cme in interplanetary space .",
    "as previous studies have shown ( see sec.[sec_exp ] ) , the expansion speed is correlated with the radial propagation speed with a coefficient of about 0.55 , and most mcs did not undergo a self - similar expansion at 1 au in radial direction , i.e. , the radius is not evolving proportionally to the heliocentric distance . in our statistics , 62%/17% of mcs",
    "underexpanded / overexpanded with an expansion rate @xmath204 , and on average the expansion rate is about 0.6 . 3 .",
    "the poloidal motion is not as significant as expanding motion generally , but does exist in some cases .",
    "its speed is on the order of 10 km s@xmath72 at 1 au .",
    "the last point is of particular interest .",
    "considering the possible presence of small pure - axial velocity ( see sec.[sec_prop ] ) , there may exist helical plasma motion following the helical magnetic field lines of an mc , which is worth to be investigated further .",
    "no matter how the plasma elements move inside the mc , the presence of the poloidal motion means that mcs may carry non - zero angular momentum .",
    "we think that there are at least three possible causes of the angular momentum .",
    "the first is that the angular momentum is generated locally through the interaction with ambient solar wind .",
    "if there is the velocity difference between the solar wind and an mc , the solar wind plasma would stream around the mc body . the viscosity or",
    "some other processes may cause the poloidal motion inside the mc .",
    "if this is true , we would expect that the poloidal speed , @xmath205 , is stronger at the periphery of the flux rope and therefore the absolute value of the derived @xmath205 is positively correlated with the closest approach , @xmath33 .",
    "our statistical study suggests that there is a weak correlation between them as shown in figure  [ fg_vcir - dep]a ; the correlation coefficient is about 0.4 .",
    "this result implies that the local solar wind interaction perhaps is probably a factor for the poloidal motion but not the only one .",
    "the second possible cause is that the angular momentum is generated internally all the time of the cme from its early phase in the corona to propagation phase in interplanetary space .",
    "it is well known that the magnetic energy of a cme will decrease when it expands ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the decreased magnetic energy may go into thermal energy and kinetic energy through some mechanisms .",
    "it means that the poloidal motion could be somehow generated inside the mc .",
    "if this is true , the decreased magnetic energy must partially go into the rotational kinetic energy , and we would expect that the poloidal speed , @xmath2 , be more or less dependent on the radial propagation speed , @xmath89 , because generally the faster the propagation speed is the larger is the rate of the magnetic energy decrease . as we can see in figure",
    "[ fg_vcir - dep]b , there is also a weak correlation with a coefficient of 0.4 .",
    "it suggests that the internal process perhaps is another factor for the poloidal motion .",
    "the numerical simulations of the evolution of magnetic flux rope by @xcite had shown that the expansion of a flux rope may cause the significantly azimuthal velocity , i.e. , the poloidal speed in our study , even if the azimuthal velocity was zero initially .",
    "the third one may be that the angular momentum is generated initially at the eruption of the cme in the corona , and carried all the way to 1 au .",
    "the kinking / unkinking behavior and rotation of the whole erupting magnetic structure are often observed in coronagraphs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such processes might introduce poloidal motion in the body of the cme .",
    "however , if the angular momentum is conserved as that we treated in the model ( see eq.[eq_vphi ] ) , we may estimate that the poloidal speed will be about 200 times of that at 1 au , or about 2000 km s@xmath72 near the sun if the poloidal speed is about 10 km s@xmath72 at 1 au .",
    "it is interesting to check the imaging data of cmes to search such a fast poloidal motion though no such a phenomenon was reported so far .",
    "no matter which of the above speculation(s ) is right , the evidence of poloidal motion inside mcs does shed a new light on the dynamic evolution of cmes from its birth to interplanetary space .",
    "some outstanding questions are open .",
    "how is the angular momentum in the solar wind transfered into an mc if the first speculation is right ?",
    "how is the magnetic energy of an mc converted into the rotational kinetic energy if the second speculation is right ?",
    "how does the poloidal motion depend on the heliocentric distance ?",
    "whether or how does the poloidal motion modify the macro / micro - scopic properties of an mc ?",

    "<S> magnetic clouds ( mcs ) are the interplanetary counterparts of coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) , and usually modeled by a flux rope . by assuming the quasi - steady evolution and self - similar expansion , we introduce three types of global motion into a cylindrical force - free flux rope model , and developed a new velocity - modified model for mcs . </S>",
    "<S> the three types of the global motion are the linear propagating motion away from the sun , the expanding and the poloidal motion with respect to the axis of the mc . </S>",
    "<S> the model is applied to 72 mcs observed by wind spacecraft to investigate the properties of the plasma motion of mcs . </S>",
    "<S> first , we find that some mcs had a significant propagation velocity perpendicular to the radial direction , suggesting the direct evidence of the cme s deflected propagation and/or rotation in interplanetary space . </S>",
    "<S> second , we confirm the previous results that the expansion speed is correlated with the radial propagation speed and most mcs did not expand self - similarly at 1 au . in our statistics , about 62%/17% of mcs underwent a under / over - expansion at 1 au and the expansion rate is about 0.6 on average . </S>",
    "<S> third , most interestingly , we find that a significant poloidal motion did exist in some mcs . </S>",
    "<S> three speculations about the cause of the poloidal motion are therefore proposed . </S>",
    "<S> these findings advance our understanding of the mc s properties at 1 au as well as the dynamic evolution of cmes from the sun to interplanetary space . </S>"
