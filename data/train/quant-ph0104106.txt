    "the purpose of this contribution is twofold : to review how an su(n ) transformation can be experimentally realized using optical elements , and to show how such an experimental realization can be used to investigate the cyclic evolution of a state over the manifold su(n)/u(n-1 ) .",
    "the bulk of the results will be presented explicitly for su(3 ) ( see @xcite for further details ) and su(4 ) , although it will become clear that the method can be applied to any su(n ) .",
    "recall that cyclic evolution of a wave function yields the original state plus a phase shift , and this phase shift is a sum of a dynamical phase @xmath0 and a geometric ( or topological , or quantal , or berry ) phase @xmath1 shift@xcite .",
    "the geometric phase shift is important not just for quantum systems but also for all of wave physics . thus far , controlled geometric  phase experiments , both realized and proposed , have been exclusively concerned with the abelian geometric phase arising in the evolution of u(1)invariant states @xcite    here , we generalize the above results to an abelian geometric phase which arises from geodesic transformations of u(n-1)invariant states in su(n)/u(n-1 ) space .",
    "the scheme employs a sequence of optical element , henceforth called su(n ) elements because they perform transformations described by an su(n ) matrix , arranged so that the net result of the sequence cyclically evolves an initial state back to itself up to a phase .",
    "it will be seen that the decomposition of an su(n ) transformation into a product of appropriate su(2 ) subgroup transformations is the prescription to construct each su(n ) element as a sequence of su(2 ) elements .",
    "it is important to distinguish the evolution of states in the geometric space su(n)/u(n-1 ) from the transformations of the optical beam as it progresses through the interferometer .",
    "it is possible to set up the experiment so as to eliminate the dynamical phase associated with these optical transformations , thus making the dynamical phase irrelevant for our purpose .",
    "the cyclic evolution described here occurs in the geometric space , and the geometric phase of interest is related to this evolution .",
    "consider an optical element which mixes two input beams .",
    "it is , formally , a black box which performs some transformation , as the output is not the same as the input .",
    "we are here interested by optical elements which mix the input beams in a linear way , _",
    "i.e. _ the output is a linear combination of the inputs .",
    "furthermore , we will assume that the optical element is passive , _",
    "i.e. _ it does not globally create or annihilate photons .",
    "the optical elements the enter in the construction of su(n ) device are beam splitters , mirrors and phase shifters .",
    "a phase shifter is essentially a slab of material which increases the optical path lenght of one beam relative to the other .",
    "a beam splitter is a partially  silvered mirror which lets photons through with some probability .",
    "provided that losses can be ignored , each of these optical elements can be associated with an su(2 ) unitary transformation@xcite .",
    "it is therefore advantageous to factorize each su(n ) transformation into a product of su(2)@xmath2 subgroup transformations mixing fields @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "an optical element mixing two fields is associated with an su(2 ) transformation in the following way .",
    "suppose that _ one _ photon enters the black box .",
    "we may assume that it will enter the optical system either via beam one or beam two .",
    "thus the hilbert space of input states is two  dimensional .",
    "as the transformation is linear , the set of all possible output states will also be a two  dimensional space .",
    "clearly this conclusion does not change if the input state is a general state @xmath5 , where the photon has probability @xmath6 of being in beam 1 and probability @xmath7 of being in beam 2 ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 are complex numbers ) .",
    "suppose now that _ two _ photons enter the black box .",
    "then , we can have one of three possibilities : two photons enter in beam 1 , one photon enters in each beam , or both photons enter in beam 2 . in this case , the hilbert space of states is three  dimensional .",
    "continuing in this way , and using the fact that the input photons are indistinguishable , one rapidly works out that , in a system containing @xmath10 photons , the relevant hilbert space is of dimension @xmath11 .",
    "the conservation of photon number leads to the following constraint on the possible form of the linear transformation .",
    "consider first the case of a single photon .",
    "the optical transformation @xmath12 with @xmath13 complex numbers , transforms a general state @xmath14 into the output state @xmath15 such that @xmath16 taking the transpose complex conjugate of that to find @xmath17 , multiplying from the right by @xmath15 , we find that , if the number of photon ( = 1 ) is to be conserved for any input state , @xmath18 implies that @xmath19 , the unit matrix .",
    "thus , @xmath20 is a @xmath21 unitary transformation . because we are only interested in the relative phase between the beams , the determinant of @xmath20 can chosen without loss generality to be + 1 , so that @xmath20 is an su(2 ) matrix .",
    "if the black box performs a transformation @xmath20 that is an su(2 ) transformation when there is a single photon in the system , it must also perform an su(2 ) transformation when there are @xmath22 photons in the system : the transformtation effected by the black box can not depend on the number of photons in the system ( at least not in the regimes that we are considering ) .",
    "thus , in a system of two photons , where state space is three  dimensional , @xmath20 will be @xmath23 representation of the relevant su(2 ) transformation . in a system containing @xmath10 photon",
    ", @xmath20 will be an su(2 ) matrix of dimension @xmath24@xcite .",
    "it is well known that an su(2 ) transformation can be factored into a product of three subtransformations : @xmath25    this factorization is a prescription on how to construct the su(2 ) device : a slab of material is inserted in one beamline so as to create a relative phase shift of @xmath26 , a partially silvered mirror which lets @xmath27 photons from beam 1 through is then inserted , and another phase shifter completes the design .",
    "in an su(3 ) interferometer , an general su(3 ) matrix is decomposed into a product of three su(2 ) matrices",
    "@xcite : @xmath28 where @xmath29 .",
    "this factorization , symbolically written @xmath30 , is a _ de facto _ prescription on how to build the su(3 ) device : fields @xmath31 and @xmath32 are mixed followed by a mixing of the output field  @xmath31 with the field in channel  @xmath33 , and , finally , the output field  @xmath31 is mixed with field  @xmath32 .    as it is possible to factorize an su(n ) matrix in terms of su(2 ) submatrices @xcite , the process of constructing a general su(n ) device is perfectly obvious and follows the lines illustrated explicitly for the su(3 ) device .",
    "for instance , the appropriate factorization of an su(4 ) matrix is a product of the type @xmath34 where @xmath35 is an su(2 ) matrix mixing fields @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the factorization of an su(n ) matrix into su(2 ) subgroup matrices is not unique , and the number of su(2 ) elements required to construct an su(n ) device can vary according to the parametrization : an estimate of the number of su(2 ) devices required to construct an su(n ) element was given in @xcite .",
    "finally , we mention that su(3 ) and su(4 ) devices have been constructed but with an aim to study non - classical statistics @xcite .",
    "the total phase @xmath38 acquired by a state during a generic cyclic evolution is the sum of @xmath39 .",
    "a special type of evolution is the geodesic evolution@xcite ; by transforming the output state along geodesic paths in the geometric space , the geometric phase shift along each path is zero .",
    "an essential property of geodesic evolutions is that they are not transitive : the product of two such evolutions is not necessary another geodesic evolution .",
    "this is most easily illustrated by drawing three points on a plane at random .",
    "it is well known that the geodesic on a plane is a straight line .",
    "let @xmath40 and @xmath41 denote the three points .",
    "then it is clear that , even if @xmath42 is the straight ( geodesic ) line that connects @xmath43 and @xmath44 , and even if @xmath45 is the straight line that connect @xmath46 and @xmath41 , the combined segment @xmath47 is _ not _ a geodesic between @xmath48 and @xmath41 .",
    "this property makes it possible to construct a cyclic evolution from a sequence of geodesic legs : the geometric phase acquired during the circuit is then a global property of the entire circuit .    for definiteness ,",
    "let us consider su(3 ) .",
    "there , the evolution of the state  @xmath49 to the state @xmath50 via 3 geodesic paths in the geometric space can be described by 3 one ",
    "parameter su(3 ) group elements @xmath51 , with @xmath52 an evolution parameter .",
    "these transformations satisfy the conditions that @xmath53 is the identity element and @xmath54 for some fixed end values @xmath55 of the evolution parameters .",
    "we consider evolutions @xmath56 of the form @xmath57 with @xmath58 an element of su(3 ) satisfying @xmath59 the form of the one ",
    "parameter subgroup @xmath60 with real entries was guided by the definition of a geodesic curve between two states @xmath61 and @xmath62 , which can be written in the form @xcite @xmath63 with @xmath64 . as it is always possible to choose unit vectors @xmath61 such that @xmath65 is real and positive",
    ", it is straightforward to show that any @xmath66 of the form given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : decomposeu ] ) satisfying @xmath67 real and positive gives evolution along a geodesic curve in su(3)/u(2 ) .",
    "the form of the geodesic evolution makes it easy to obtain its physical interpretation .",
    "the transformation @xmath60 is a transformation of appropriate length along some reference geodesic ( some generalized greenwich meridian on su(3)/u(2 ) ) .",
    "the transformation @xmath58 is a principal axis transformation which correctly orients the reference geodesic so that it passes through @xmath68 and @xmath69 . @xmath58",
    "therefore depends on the initial and final states .",
    "the three states in su(3)/u(2 ) must be chosen in a sufficiently general way to ensure that they can represent any triangle in su(3)/u(2 ) @xcite . since the latter is of dimension @xmath70 , there are @xmath70 free parameters to be chosen",
    ". the first state can be chosen , wlog , to be the `` north pole '' state .",
    "again wlog , the second state can always be chosen to lie along the reference geodesic some distance away from the initial state .",
    "the last state must therefore contain the remaining @xmath32 parameters . in short , the vertices of a geodesic triangle in su(3)/u(2 ) can , in general , be chosen as @xmath71 with @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 arbitrary .    since @xmath74",
    ", the geometric phase for the complete circuit is extracted from the overlap real positive overlap @xmath75 .",
    "this works out immediately to @xmath76    the generalization to su(4 ) is immediate : the form of eq.([eq : decomposeu ] ) remains the same , but the matrix of eq.([eq : rt ] ) is augmented to a @xmath77 matrix : @xmath78    the condition of eq.([eq : geocurve ] ) remains .",
    "as we have argued , the first two vertices of the geodesic triangle remain unchanged , but the last vertex now depends on the @xmath79 parameters of su(4)/u(3 ) : @xmath80 a form which obviously reduces to the su(3 ) case if @xmath81 . for su(4)/u(3 ) , the berry phase is again related to the inner product of @xmath82 through @xmath83 and can be seen to depend on the required number of parameters .",
    "an optical su(n ) transformation can be realized by a n  channel optical interferometer@xcite .",
    "the su(2)@xmath84 matrix  @xmath85 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rt ] ) is a special case of the generalized lossless beam splitter transformation for mixing channels  @xmath33 and  @xmath31 .",
    "more generally a beam splitter can be described by a unitary transformation between two channels@xcite .",
    "for example , a general su(2)@xmath86 beam splitter transformation for mixing channels  @xmath31 and @xmath32 is of the form @xmath87 with  @xmath88 and @xmath89 the transmitted and reflected phase  shift parameters , respectively , and @xmath90 the beam splitter transmission .",
    "a generalized beam splitter can be realized as a combination of phase shifters and 50/50 beam splitters in a mach ",
    "zehnder interferometer configuration .",
    "the goal of the following is to construct an su(3 ) optical transformations in terms of su(2 ) elements which realize the geodesic evolution in the geometric space by appropriately adjusting parameters of the interferometer",
    ".    it will be convenient to write @xmath91 in eq.([vertices ] ) as @xmath92 , where @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 are functions of @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the parameters of @xmath91 in eq .",
    "( [ vertices ] ) .",
    "following our factorization scheme , the geodesic evolution operators @xmath66 , connecting @xmath61 to @xmath62 , can be expressed as @xmath97 with @xmath85 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : rt ] ) , the parameters @xmath52 ranging from @xmath98 , and @xmath99 .",
    "note that @xmath100 and , in fact , all the parameters of @xmath101 are fixed by the requirement that @xmath102 also note that , for each @xmath36 , @xmath53 is the identity in su(3 ) and @xmath103 as required . once it is observed that @xmath104 , it is trivial to verify that each evolution satisfies eq .",
    "( [ eq : geocurve ] ) and is therefore geodesic .",
    "the geometric phase for the cyclic evolution @xmath105 is given explicitly by eq.([berryphase ] ) .",
    "this phase depends on four free parameters in the experimental scheme : @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , which describe a general geodesic triangle in su(3)/u(2 ) .",
    "the interferometer configuration for realizing the necessary evolution about the geodesic triangle is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : config ] .",
    "this configuration consists of a sequence of su(2)@xmath2 transformations , and we use the shorthand notation @xmath106 to designate the three parameters associated with the generalized beam splitter .",
    "the three ",
    "channel interferometer consists of a sequence of nine su(2)@xmath2 transformations .",
    "the field enters port  @xmath107 , and the vacuum state enters ports  @xmath108 and  @xmath109 .",
    "= 6.0 cm    for su(4 ) , the first evolution is the same , but the second will depend on more parameters as the dimensionality of su(4)/u(3 ) is larger than that of su(3)/u(2 ) .",
    "briefly , we have : @xmath110 where @xmath111 and where @xmath112 is an su(3 ) matrix of the form @xmath113 whose details are unimportant for our purposes .    although su(3 ) and su(4 ) interferometry have been considered in some details , the methods employed here can be extended to su(n ) , or n  channel , interferometry@xcite .",
    "the schemes discussed above employing such a device would produce and enable observation of the geometric phase shift for geodesic transformations of states",
    "invariant under subgroups of states in the dimensional coset space .",
    "this contribution is a summary of recent theoretical work on the possibility of measuring berry phases using optical elements .",
    "the scheme depends on the optical realization of su(n ) transformations in the optical domain ; this is possible because the lie algebra su(n ) can be realized in terms of boson creation and destruction operators which have immediate interpretation as photon field operators .",
    "there also exists the possibility of realizing sp(2n,@xmath114 ) transformation using optical elements @xcite : the lie algebra sp(2n,@xmath114 ) also has a realization in terms of boson operators .",
    "the setup to measure berry phase in an optical experiment is interesting because it provides a very practical realization of otherwise abstract ideas and allows one to do `` experimental differential geometry '' over su(n)/u(n-1 ) .",
    "this contribution has dealt exclusively with the optical realization of abelian berry phase : even if states are invariant under u(n ) , two states are equivalent if they differ by a u(1)phase .",
    "it is possible to enlarge the equivalence class to obtain the so  called non - abelian berry phase @xcite , which has been studied in the context of degenerate states .",
    "it is possible to study the non - abelian version of the results presented here by using polarization : two states of different polarization are declared equivalent .",
    "the larger equivalence class comes about because a rotation of the polarization plane is an su(2 ) transformation .",
    "the experimental aspects of this remain , at the moment , unclear .",
    "an optical experiment to measure an su(2 ) phase would require optical devices which perform `` tunable '' polarization  dependent transformation .",
    "the theoretical aspects of this questions are currently under investigation .",
