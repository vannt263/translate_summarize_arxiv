    "this vortex pinning phenomenon becomes significant at strong fields which push the vortex deeper past pinning sites .",
    "another reason is that the probe nonlinearity is over - simplified in the calculation : the phase of the @xmath127 is not included when subtracting the measured @xmath13 in the normal state from the measured @xmath13 in the superconducting state .    the loop area @xmath44 for the fit at t=9 k ( fig .",
    "[ bulknbp3fpf9k_fit ] ) is @xmath128 @xmath108 , equivalent to a circular loop with radius @xmath129 @xmath102 .",
    "this value of the fit loop radius is on the scale of the magnetic gap ( @xmath130 100 nm ) in the write head probe and implies the resolution of the magnetic write head probe in the near field microwave microscope .",
    "this length scale is also consistent with those put forward by halbritter for the distance between weak links on the surface of air - exposed bulk nb @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "( normal resistance of the junction ) and @xmath44 ( area of the induced screening current loop ) .",
    "each value is determined by the fitting method of the phase slip model from the @xmath13 versus @xmath131 data in fig .",
    "[ nbp3fpfset2 ] .",
    "note that all data points for both @xmath97 and @xmath44 are connected by an interpolation spline function.,width=288 ]    a summary of the temperature dependent @xmath97 and @xmath44 from our model fits for the effective @xmath13 at different temperatures is shown in fig .",
    "we see that these two parameters are temperature dependent .",
    "( note that the number of junctions in the loop , n , could also vary , but here we choose to keep this value fixed ) .",
    "one reason for temperature dependent @xmath97 and @xmath44 is because the screening current loop will look for the easiest trajectory with highest critical current of the weak link josephson junctions to pass through .",
    "one can see the @xmath97 gradually goes up with decreasing temperature from 9 k to 5.7 k. this is consistent with the decrease of quasi - particle density upon going to lower temperature . for",
    "@xmath132 , a feature of the jump from low - values at t=6.3 k to the larger values at t=5.7 k indicates the loops get bigger at low temperature .",
    "the temperature of this jump is coincident with the transition temperature of nbo@xmath5 material , or proximity - coupled nb , in the vicinity of weak links in bulk nb with reduced transition temperatures of 5.1 k to 6.0 k as identified by halbritter @xcite .",
    "below 5.7 k , the @xmath133 decreases with decreasing temperature .",
    "this decrease also corresponds to a decrease of the area @xmath44 with decreasing temperature below 5.7 k. although we do nt know how to interpret this decrease of @xmath97 and @xmath44 at low temperature , several possible issues may be in play .",
    "the localized heating of the sample by the probe may be another possible reason for the non - monotonic dependence in fig .",
    "these possibilities may affect the screening current area @xmath44 at low temperature and result in a corresponding change of @xmath97 at low temperature .",
    "these results are consistent with the existence of a dense network of weak links on the surface of air - exposed nb .",
    "it is clear that our microscope is probing this complex network on the scale of the defect size and that the network evolves significantly under rf - field excitation as a function of temperature .",

    "an interpolation function for the temperature dependence @xmath133 and @xmath132 plotted as the solid line of fig .",
    "[ rns ] and used for @xmath42 fitting .",
    "the black solid line in fig .",

    "other parameters ( @xmath109 @xmath102 , n=10 , @xmath110 @xmath102 ) remain the same as the fitting of @xmath13 on @xmath24 .",
    "the experimental data points are shown in red circles taken at 5.5 dbm excitation power and 5.025 ghz excitation frequency from fig .",
    "[ bulknbp3ftset2 ] . due to the finite number of data points in the interpolation function for the temperature dependence @xmath133 and @xmath132",
    ", the fitting curve shows some discrepancy . however , most of the @xmath42 data points still follow the trend of the phase slip model . the fit of the 0 dbm data in fig .",
    "[ bulknbp3ftset2 ] is qualitatively correct as well , which makes a compelling case that the nonlinear mechanism comes from the weak link josephson junction while the excitation power is less than the first deep oscillation in the effective @xmath30 curve .",
    "a clear reproducible nonlinear response signal from the surface of superconducting bulk nb is obtained by the magnetic write head probe .",
    "the success of nonlinear excitation on bulk nb also implies the magnetic field from the magnetic write head probe is on the order of the thermodynamic critical field of the measured bulk nb sample . from fits to the data , nonlinearity from the weak - link josephson effect can explain the measured nonlinear response on the bulk nb for both @xmath42 and @xmath30 measurements .",
    "the measured nonlinearity of the bulk nb samples is perhaps due to the contaminated surface in the fabrication process or subsequent handling in air .",
    "the nonlinear near - field magnetic field microwave microscope has great potential to identify the electrodynamic properties of bulk nb materials and to image the electrodynamic defects on superconducting nb in the ghz frequency region .",
