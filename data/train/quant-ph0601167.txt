    "quantum process tomography ( qpt ) is a method of experimentally determining the unknown dynamics of a quantum system .",
    "this is crucial as a method of checking the functionality of would - be quantum information processing devices . using knowledge obtained from qpt applied to such a device",
    ", one can ideally locate and possibly rectify any sources of errors or decoherence .",
    "the standard qpt technique , which involves the use of multiple test states , was first developed by nielsen and chuang @xcite and poyatos , cirac and zoller @xcite .",
    "a different technique , exploiting entangled states , was subsequently proposed by leung @xcite and dariano and lo presti @xcite .",
    "more recently , methods have been developed to determine a process from a tomographically incomplete set of measurements @xcite , as well as techniques to ascertain the master equation describing time evolution of the system @xcite .",
    "qpt has been performed in liquid nmr implementations @xcite , numerous optical systems @xcite , atoms in an optical lattice @xcite and in bulk solid state nmr @xcite . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", this work contains the first example of qpt performed on a single solid state qubit .",
    "the nitrogen vacancy defect ( or n - v center ) is a naturally occurring defect in diamond with nitrogen impurities .",
    "it can be manufactured in type ib synthetic diamond by irradiation and subsequent annealing at temperatures above 550 c ; radiation damage causes vacancies in the diamond lattice and annealing leads to migration of vacancies towards the nitrogen atoms ( see figure 1(a ) ) .",
    "the n - v center can also be produced in type iia diamonds by n@xmath1 ion implantation @xcite .",
    "the energy level scheme of the n - v center is shown in figure [ levels](b ) .",
    "it consists of a triplet ground state @xmath2 and a triplet excited state @xmath3 with a metastable singlet state @xmath4 . at zero magnetic field",
    "the ground triplet state energy levels are split into degenerate @xmath5 sublevels and the @xmath6 sublevel .",
    "this is due to the magnetic dipole - dipole interaction between the 2 unpaired electrons .",
    "this dipole - dipole interaction can be described by a hamiltonian term @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the zero - field splitting ( or fine structure ) tensor and @xmath9 . using standard techniques @xcite this dipolar term",
    "can be rewritten as @xmath10+e(s^2_x+s^2_y),\\ ] ] where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are zero - field splitting parameters which are dependent on the symmetry of the molecule .",
    "the axial symmetry of the n - v center means that @xmath13 mhz , while @xmath11 for this system has previously been characterized @xcite as @xmath14 mhz .",
    "the end result is that , at zero magnetic field , the @xmath5 sublevels are degenerate and at an energy 2880 mhz greater than that of the @xmath6 sublevel . with an applied magnetic field aligned along the z axis of the molecular system ( i.e. @xmath15 ) the total hamiltonian , including zero - field splitting term , takes the simple form @xmath16,\\ ] ] where the gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath17 , is 2.8025 mhz / gauss .",
    "this hamiltonian leads to a @xmath18 transition of energy @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the applied magnetic field ( figure [ triplet](a ) ) , measured in gauss .",
    "the fluorescence intensity corresponding to the @xmath6 transition between the ground @xmath21 and excited @xmath22 triplet states is strongest .",
    "optically detected magnetic resonance ( odmr ) is used to perform state readout @xcite , i.e. the population of the @xmath6 sublevel is identified by the amount of measured fluorescence ( figure [ triplet](b ) ) .",
    "manipulation of the qubit state is via standard electron spin resonance ( esr ) techniques , using microwave pulses resonant with the @xmath18 transition .",
    "the spin longitudinal relaxation time , @xmath23 , is on the order of milliseconds at room temperature @xcite ( relaxation time of the order of seconds is expected at low temperature ) .",
    "transverse relaxation times ( or decoherence times ) , @xmath24 , of up to 60 microseconds have been reported @xcite , for samples with low nitrogen concentration .    in the n - v center ,",
    "initialization into the @xmath6 state is achieved by optical pumping .",
    "optically induced spin polarization is thought to be related to spin - selective intersystem crossing from the photoexcited @xmath3 triplet state to the metastable @xmath4 singlet state ( figure [ levels](b ) ) i.e there is an irreversible transition between @xmath25 .",
    "the spin polarization achieved by this pumping corresponds to at least 70% population in the @xmath6 sublevel at room temperature . instead of a pure state , corresponding to 100% polarization ,",
    "we have what is known as a pseudopure state which takes the general form @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the number of qubits and @xmath28 is related to the amount of polarization .    in the case of the n - v center ,",
    "the 70% population of the @xmath6 sublevel , after optical pumping , corresponds to @xmath29tr@xmath30 and so @xmath31    it is hoped that , in future experiments , the use of projective readouts , which are possible at low temperatures , will lead to increased polarizations .",
    "a controlled two - qubit quantum gate in which the vacancy electron spin is hyperfine coupled to a nearby c@xmath32 nucleus , has recently been performed using this system @xcite .",
    "we briefly review the standard qpt technique :    @xmath33 prepare a complete basis of input states @xmath34 ( e.g @xmath35,@xmath36 , for a single qubit )    @xmath33 apply the unknown process @xmath37  to each member @xmath38    @xmath33 reconstruct the output states @xmath39 using quantum state tomography    while each of the reconstructed @xmath39 will be physically valid density matrices ( by appropriate use of quantum state tomography ) it is possible that the process @xmath37  describes is unphysical e.g. the @xmath39 are mutually inconsistent or @xmath37  is not completely positive . * experimental noise and a finite number of measurements to determine expectation values can result in a reconstructed @xmath37  which is not physically valid*.    if it is possible to write a process in the kraus representation then we can be sure it represents a physically valid process ( one that is described by a completely positive map ) .",
    "we can specify an unknown process @xmath37  by experimentally determining the kraus operators @xcite @xmath40 which describe it @xmath41 or , using a fixed ( complete ) basis of operators @xmath42 @xmath43    @xmath44 is a matrix of coefficients which completely describes the process @xmath37 and is positive hermitean by construction .",
    "the trace preserving constraint @xmath45 becomes @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath33 from the measurement results @xmath47 , @xmath48 can be determined , given the relation @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath33 in order to determine @xmath0 from the matrix @xmath50 one operates on @xmath50 with the pseudoinverse of @xmath51 , where @xmath51 is derived theoretically from the relation @xmath52 .",
    "@xmath33 using this last relation and we can see @xmath53 and so inverting @xmath51 gives us @xmath0 , as required .",
    "to derive @xmath40 from @xmath0 we first diagonalize @xmath0 with a unitary @xmath54 @xmath55 where @xmath56 are the eigenvalues of @xmath0 .",
    "the kraus operators can then be obtained by @xmath57    note that this procedure only works if @xmath58 which follows from the positivity ( semidefinite ) of @xmath0 .",
    "it is this property which we use to check the physicality of a process @xmath37 ; if the @xmath0 matrix reconstructed from experimental data has negative eigenvalue(s ) then this indicates that noise and/or finitely sampled expectation values has caused the output data to infer an unphysical process . to overcome this problem ,",
    "a physical matrix @xmath59 is found which is as close as possible to the original @xmath0 in some sense . specifically , we used a technique analogous to mle for state estimation @xcite by minimising a deviation function , @xmath60 , incorporating a general parameterization for a positive @xmath59 : @xmath61 where @xmath50 is a lagrange multiplier ( which ensures a trace - preserving process ) and @xmath62 where @xmath63 is a @xmath64 complex , lower triangular matrix with @xmath65 real parameters , @xmath66 . in the case of a single qubit",
    "we have : @xmath67 the algorithm used to minimise @xmath60 in was the nelder - mead simplex algorithm as implemented in matlab .",
    "as is often the case with numerical minimization problems , typically contains numerous local minima .",
    "our preliminary investigations suggested that , given a random initial point in parameter space , the algorithm would often fail to find the global minimum .",
    "as such , a good starting point , @xmath68 , in was deemed necessary if the results were to be meaningful . in order to obtain @xmath68 we used a technique based on principal component analysis @xcite .",
    "if the experimentally determined matrix @xmath0 is not positive semidefinite , one can  filter \" it by setting any ( presumably quite small ) negative eigenvalues to zero .",
    "specifically , if we decompose @xmath0 as @xmath69 where @xmath11 is a diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues of @xmath0 , then we can construct a similar but positive matrix @xmath70 via @xmath71 where @xmath72 is identical to @xmath11 except that any negative eigenvalues have been set equal to zero .",
    "from @xmath70 we can extract good initial parameters @xmath68 by performing a cholesky decomposition ( e.g. using the in - built  chol \" function in matlab ) .",
    "any one qubit state can be parameterized by a so - called bloch vector @xmath73 .",
    "equivalently , one can explicitly include the unit coefficient of the identity basis component and parameterise the qubit state by a 4-vector @xmath74 : @xmath75 where @xmath76 @xcite . in this basis",
    "any linear trace - preserving evolution @xmath37  takes the affine form @xmath77 and the process applied to an arbitrary input state is an affine map on @xmath73 , ( although it remains a linear map on @xmath78 ) : @xmath79 or , more explicitly , @xmath80    * identifying the surface of the unit bloch sphere as the set of all possible input states , we can visualize a process @xmath37  by its action on the sphere*. the @xmath81 matrix @xmath12 is responsible for deformation and rotation of the bloch sphere , while @xmath82 denotes displacement from @xmath83 .",
    "we can gain crude but immediate insight into the nature of a single qubit process by using this visualization technique .",
    "bloch vectors with @xmath84 do not correspond to any valid density matrix .",
    "hence , when a process is depicted this way , any protrusions of the output ellipsoid outside the unit bloch sphere mean that the process is not trace preserving .",
    "complete positivity also places constraints on physically allowable output ellipsoids . for a more detailed analysis of this problem",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "the crucial point to note is that seemingly innocuous ellipsoids ( i.e. contained within the unit bloch sphere and not overly deformed ) can represent a process which is not physically valid .",
    "the variety of allowable ellipsoids is particularly reduced when the translation vector @xmath82 in @xmath85 is non - zero .",
    "the qpt experiment was performed at room temperature using diamond nanocrystals obtained from type ib synthetic diamond .",
    "diamond nanocrystals were spin coated on a glass substrate , and single nanocrystals were observed with a homebuilt sample - scanning confocal microscope . in order to ensure the presence of a single defect in the laser focus",
    ", the second - order coherence was measured using hanbury - brown and twiss interferometer and the contrast of the antibunching depth was determined . in order to perform many repetitions ( to obtain good expectation values ) in a reasonable amount of time ,",
    "a sample with a relatively short coherence time ( @xmath86s ) was chosen .",
    "microwaves were coupled to the sample by a esr microresonator connected to a 40w travelling wave tube amplifier .",
    "a magnetic field ( @xmath87 , @xmath88 gauss ) was applied to the defect in order to remove degeneracy of the @xmath89 energy levels .",
    "rabi oscillations of fluoresence intensity were used to obtain expectation values .",
    "a reference nutation was initially taken in order to normalize the measurement nutations ( i.e. set 0,1 levels for expectation values for the pseudopure initial state ) .",
    "in addition this reference oscillation was used to derive the microwave pulse time required to perform @xmath90 and @xmath91 rotations of the bloch vector . a complete basis of four input states",
    "was then prepared using microwave pulses resonant with qubit transitions .",
    "the @xmath92 state was obtained directly by optical pumping and three remaining input states @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 were obtained by application of suitable @xmath91 or @xmath96 pulses .",
    "each of these states was left to decohere for a series of time intervals @xmath97 . as a last step",
    ", measurements of the diagonal and off - diagonal elements of the density matrix were performed .",
    "estimates of the density matrix elements were extracted from experimental data ( rabi oscillations ) using the maximum entropy ( maxent ) technique @xcite .",
    "this method returns a physically valid density matrix which satisfies , as closely as possible , the expectation values of measured observables . in cases where only incomplete knowledge of the output state is known ,",
    "an additional constraint is used ; the reconstructed state must also have the maximum allowable von neumann entropy .",
    "in summary the qpt experiment was performed as follows :    @xmath33 the n - v center was optically pumped to the initial pseudopure state @xmath98 hereafter we neglect the identity component and treat this initial state as @xmath99 .",
    "@xmath33 following this , each of the following input states @xmath34 ( @xmath35,@xmath36 was created by application of suitable @xmath91 or @xmath90 pulses .",

    "the method is different to standard qpt techniques insofar as it assumes markovian dynamics and , consequentially , the reconstructed equation has separate terms which describe the unitary and non - unitary aspects of the evolution .",
