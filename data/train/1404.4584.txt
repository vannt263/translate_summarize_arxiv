    "the applicability of the weibull distribution to describe the fracture strength of brittle and quasi - brittle materials has been a topic of intense debate  @xcite .",
    "several experimental studies argue that the weibull distribution is not always the best statistical distribution to fit fracture data  @xcite ( numerous other argue otherwise ) , particularly for quasi - brittle materials that have significant precursor damage .",
    "these observations demand a general theoretical explanation .",
    "the suggested explanations for these empirical observation includes bimodal or multimodal flaw size distribution  @xcite , r - curve behavior  @xcite , small size of the datasets  @xcite , and thermal activated crack nucleation @xcite .",
    "here we provide a general explanation for these observations by showing that the weibull distribution is unstable in the renormalization group sense for quasi - brittle materials , and thus not applicable at long length scales .    in deriving the weibull distribution of fracture strengths it is invariably assumed that the material volume has a population of non - interacting crack - like defects , and fracture happens as soon as the weakest of these defects starts to grow  @xcite .",
    "this assumption is also known as the ` weakest - link hypothesis ' .",
    "experimental observations suggest that this assumption does not hold for a large class of quasi - brittle materials . these materials , including paper  @xcite , granite  @xcite , antler bone  @xcite , wood  @xcite , and composites  @xcite etc .",
    ", typically `` crackle ''  @xcite , suggesting that several local cracks grow and get arrested prior to global fracture .",
    "advanced composites are designed to fail gracefully , that is , they have multiple failures before the ultimate fracture .",
    "it is clear that for such materials the weakest defect does not dominate the fracture properties of the material , and the defects interact via elastic fields .",
    "the emergent scale - invariant properties of these interactions have been a topic of intense study in the statistical physics community  @xcite .",
    "several researchers have used the weibull theory to model these quasi - brittle materials .",
    "we show that even if the microscopic strength distribution is weibull , the emergent distribution is significantly distorted due to elastic interactions and metastability .",
    "thus , the weibull distribution is not stable in the renormalization group sense .",
    "we provide numerical evidence to support our theoretical claims .    for brittle materials such as glasses or ceramics that fracture catastrophically without precursor damage",
    ", it is assumed that the distribution of fracture strength can be derived from the distribution of flaw sizes by using griffith s criteria ( or equivalently the stress intensity approach ) and ignoring effects such as crack bridging or coalescence  @xcite . for exponentially distributed cracks",
    "the fracture strength is expected to be described by the duxbury - leath - beale ( dlb ) distribution @xcite , while only in the case of power law distributed cracks one expects to obtain the weibull distribution @xcite .",
    "it is , however , challenging to measure the flaw size distribution experimentally , and thus these assumptions are rarely verified empirically  @xcite .",
    "one of the aims of this paper is use numerical simulations to show that the simple relations that are widely used in the literature are not accurate , and further study is needed to understand the discrepancy .",
    "this observation has important implications for material engineers who aim to improve the fracture properties of brittle materials by controlling the micro - structure .    in light of the above discussed limitations of the weibull theory",
    ", what distribution should one use to fit fracture data ? to answer this question , we consider two classes of fuse networks to model brittle and quasi - brittle materials . both of the these models are derived from the classical fuse network models  @xcite . in the model for brittle materials ,",
    "the fuse network is seeded with power law distributed cracks with varying morphology .",
    "this is different from the classical diluted fuse network model which has an exponential distribution of cracks  @xcite .",
    "the model for quasi - brittle materials has a continuous distribution of fuse strengths , where each fuse strength is a random number drawn from a standard weibull distribution . in this manner",
    "we can ensure that the microscopic strength distribution is weibull , and study the emergent macroscopic distribution .",
    "this model differs from its counterparts in the literature  @xcite by the choice of the microscopic disorder , and enables a numerical study of the stability of the weibull distribution . analyzing the simulations",
    ", we find that the recently proposed t - method provides a suitable alternative to fit the numerical data @xcite .",
    "the method is general enough that it can be applied in a wide variety of cases .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : weibulltheory ] presents the basics of the classical weibull theory and the commonly used relation between the strength distribution and the defect size distribution .",
    "the details of the numerical models used in this study are discussed in section  [ sec : rfm ] .",
    "section  [ sec : weibstab ] presents theoretical and numerical evidence to show that the weibull distribution is unstable under coarse graining for quasi - brittle materials . in section  [ sec : mod ] we present the numerical evidence to show that the relation between the strength distribution and the flaw size distribution is nontrivial , and can not be obtained by a straightforward application of the griffith s criteria .",
    "we discuss the possible sources of the observed discrepancy .",
    "section  [ sec : tmethod ] presents a comparison of the performance of the weibull distribution and the recently proposed t - method for fitting the simulation data for quasi - brittle fuse networks .",
    "the conclusions are presented in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "in this section we review the classical weibull theory in order to facilitate the discussion in the following sections .",
    "we consider a material volume @xmath0 subjected to a stress field @xmath1 .",
    "the material is supposed to have a density of defects of various shapes and sizes , such that @xmath2 is the probability of not finding a defect with critical stress less than @xmath3 in a volume @xmath4 of the material .",
    "here we assume that the stress in uniaxial and tensile ; the case of full tensorial stress is similar and is not presented here to avoid unnecessary notational complexity .",
    "the volume @xmath4 is supposed to be large enough that it contains sufficient number of cracks , and yet small enough that the stress can be considered roughly constant across it ; it is sometimes also called the representative volume element .",
    "@xmath5 is supposed to be a homogeneous material property .",
    "then , the probability that the material volume @xmath0 will survive the stress field @xmath1 is given by @xmath6 weibull recognized that taking @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a material dependent scale parameter , and @xmath9 is the material depended weibull modulus , gave a good fit for several brittle materials , and introduced what is now known as the standard weibull distribution @xcite @xmath10 it turns out that the empirical choice made by weibull can be justified by a renormalization group calculation in which one writes recursive equations describing the failure distribution as the scale is changed @xcite .",
    "the weibull distribution is one of the possible fixed points of the renormalization group transformation @xcite .",
    "the weibull distribution can alternatively be derived by connecting the function @xmath5 to the microscopic defect size distribution .",
    "the basic calculation outlined in the remainder of this section can be found in a number of important references  @xcite . according to griffith s criteria ,",
    "a crack of length @xmath11 is stable at applied normal stress @xmath3 if @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the geometry factor of the crack , and @xmath14 , the critical stress intensity factor , is a material property .",
    "the exponent of @xmath15 is applicable for ideally sharp cracks , and can have a different value for wedge shaped or blunted cracks .",
    "thus , if we take @xmath16 to be probability that the volume element @xmath4 does not contain any crack longer than @xmath11 , then we have @xmath17 if the defect size ( crack length ) distribution is a power law with exponent @xmath18 , then @xmath19 , which gives @xmath20 , where @xmath21 .",
    "thus , a power law defect size distribution with exponent @xmath18 leads to weibull distribution of fracture strength with modulus @xmath22 .",
    "as pointed out before , this entire analysis assumes that the flaws do not interact , and that the failure of the weakest flaw leads to the failure of the entire material volume .",
    "we also show in section  [ sec : weibstab ] relaxing the assumption that the weakest flaw leads to global failure has important consequences and results in the strength distribution flowing away from the weibull form . our numerical calculation reported in section  [ sec : mod ]",
    "sections show that crack bridging is an important form of crack interaction that can significantly alter the resulting weibull modulus away from the dilute limit ( but does not change the weibull form for power law distributed cracks ) .",
    "in this section we describe the computational model that we use for various classes of brittle and quasi - brittle materials . the theoretical arguments presented in later sections benefit from having a concrete model as a point of reference .",
    "we study several variants of the basic two dimensional random fuse model ( rfm ) @xcite .",
    "the rfm is a well accepted model of brittle fracture where each fuse represents a coarse grained material region ( analogue of the classical representative volume element ) .",
    "the model consists of a set of conducting fuses with unit conductivity @xmath23 and breaking threshold @xmath24 , arranged on a 45@xmath25-tilted square lattice composed by @xmath26 nodes .",
    "a unit voltage drop is applied along two parallel edges of the lattice while periodic boundary conditions are imposed along the other two edges .",
    "the kirchhoff equations are solved numerically using the algorithm proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite to determine the current flowing in each of the fuses .",
    "we then evaluate the ratio between the current @xmath27 and the breaking threshold @xmath24 and the fuse having the largest value , @xmath28 , is irreversibly removed ( burnt ) .",
    "the current is redistributed instantaneously after a fuse is burnt . each time a fuse is burnt ,",
    "it is necessary to re - calculate the current distribution in the lattice .",
    "the process of burning fuses , one at a time , is repeated until the lattice system fails completely ( becomes non - conductive ) .",
    "the random fuse model is equivalent to a scalar elastic problem where we consider a pure anti - plane shear deformation . in this condition ,",
    "the shear stress @xmath3 is related to the total current @xmath29 by @xmath30 , the shear strain @xmath31 to the voltage drop @xmath32 by @xmath33 and the conductivity @xmath34 is equivalent to the shear modulus . from the breaking sequence",
    "we can derive the current - voltage ( or stress - strain ) curve of the network under adiabatic loading as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this study",
    "we employ two different disorder distributions to model quasi - brittle and brittle materials :    * _ weibull disorder ( quasi - brittle ) . _",
    "the fuse strength threshold is chosen to be a random variable drawn from a weibull distribution with modulus @xmath9 , thus the survival probability of a fuse at applied stress @xmath3 is @xmath35 .",
    "fuse networks with continuously distributed strengths have been studied previously  @xcite . in those studies",
    "the thresholds were drawn from the uniform  @xcite , power law  @xcite , and hyperbolic distributions  @xcite . however , the focus of those studies was on the morphology and dynamic properties , while we focus on strength .",
    "further , by letting the local thresholds be weibull distributed , we can directly study the stability of the weibull distribution under coarse graining . * _ diluted cracks ( brittle ) .",
    "_ we remove a fraction @xmath36 of the fuses and assign the same breaking threshold (= 1 ) to the intact fuses  @xcite .",
    "we take @xmath37 , thus keeping the initial damage fairly dilute in order to avoid the phenomena that happens near the percolation threshold ( at @xmath38 for the tilted square lattice we are using ) .",
    "note that the missing fuses are not chosen randomly , but rather in a way that they form a set of cracks with power law distributed crack lengths with @xmath39 , where @xmath18 is the exponent of the power law .",
    "we employ both straight and fractal flaws , grown by using self - avoiding random walks .",
    "fuse networks with diluted cracks were originally studied in refs .",
    "however , in those studies the cracks lengths had an exponential distribution ( as opposed to power law ) .",
    "exponential distribution of defect sizes leads to a gumbel type distribution of strengths , and thus are markedly different from our model .",
    "for each case , we do extensive statistical sampling for network sizes @xmath40 .",
    "the standard weibull distribution reported in eq .",
    "[ eq : weibull ] is derived under the assumption that the failure of the weakest flaw ( or representative volume element ) leads to complete global failure . under this assumption ,",
    "if the strength distribution of the representative element is standard weibull with modulus @xmath9 , i.e.  @xmath41 , then the survival probability of the material volume @xmath0 is given by @xmath42 in mathematical terms , we can say that the weibull distribution is stable under coarse graining : a system composed by subsystems described by the weibull distribution is itself described by the weibull distribution .    as we mentioned earlier , however , the weakest - link assumption is not accurate in quasi - brittle materials .",
    "we can then derive the condition for eq .",
    "[ eq : simweibull ] to remain valid if this assumption is relaxed .",
    "the stress at which the weakest flaw fails scales as @xmath43 .",
    "the failure of this volume element enhances the stress on its neighbors due to stress concentration .",
    "however , the neighbors of the weakest flaw are typically not very weak , and we safely assume that their strength is near the mean strength @xmath44 . assuming that the stress concentration factor scales as @xmath45 , where @xmath13 is a geometry factor , the neighboring volume element fails if @xmath46 which yields @xmath47 as the approximate condition for the validity of the weakest link hypothesis . outside of this range",
    "the local failure of the weakest link does not trigger global failure . in this calculation",
    "we have ignored details and made several simplifications , thus it only gets the correct scaling .",
    "the above arguments show that the weakest link hypothesis is self - consistent , and the weibull distribution is stable under coarse - graining only if the weibull modulus is large enough , @xmath47 . clearly , the strength distribution flows away from the weibull distribution in the limit of @xmath48 .",
    "the typical ranges for the weibull modulus are @xmath49 for metals , @xmath50 for ceramics  @xcite , and @xmath51 for biomaterials such as nacre  @xcite .",
    "it is clear that for materials with small to moderate values of @xmath9 ( such as biomaterials ) the applicability of weibull analysis is questionable .",
    "indeed the weakest link hypothesis is manifestly false  these materials exhibit significant precursory fracture events ( crackling noise ) before failure @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : weibullflow ] shows the emergent strength distribution for fuse networks of various sizes where the fuse threshold is taken from a weibull distribution with @xmath52 .",
    "we choose such a high value of @xmath9 to show the crossover away from weibull , for smaller values of @xmath9 the distribution has already flown away from weibull even for the smallest networks that we can simulate .",

    ", with @xmath57 for the threshold distribution . if the emergent distribution was weibull , it would follow the solid black line . clearly , the distribution flows away from weibull at long length scales , showing that the weibull distribution is not stable in a renormalization group sense .",

    "however , to get some idea about the distribution , we compute a very simple minded upper - bound to the survival probability for the fuse network model . from eq .",
    "[ eq : stressintensity ] , at any given stress @xmath3 the length of the critical crack goes as @xmath58 ( i.e.  a crack longer than @xmath59 will have unstable growth ) if the fuse strength threshold is standard weibull , then the probability of having a crack of size @xmath59 at any given lattice site is at least @xmath60 . since there are @xmath54 lattice sites , the global probability of survival is at most @xmath61 making asymptotic expansions for small @xmath3 , we get @xmath62 if we take the slowly varying @xmath63 to be a constant , then the above expression is reminiscent dlb distribution@xcite .",
    "the factor of @xmath63 can be removed in a more natural way if one takes into account the stress concentration at each step of crack growth ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a similar treatment ) .",
    "our observation is supported by experimental results for some quasi - brittle materials where the dlb distribution was found to fit the data better than the weibull distribution  @xcite .    since the upper bound that we have established decays faster than any weibull function at @xmath64 ,",
    "the macroscopic survival probability can not be of the weibull form , even if the microscopic distribution is weibull .",
    "note that the arguments made here are fairly general , and thus we expect the macroscopic strength distribution for any material with significant precursor damage to deviate from the weibull distribution .",
