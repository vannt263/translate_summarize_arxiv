    "applications to neutron star phenomenology were discussed by reddy , who argued that star radii of 8  km or less clearly favor a quark - matter equation of state ( eos ) . much like in hehic s , electroweak emission is a promising signal of in - medium effects , probing the low - lying excitations ( goldstone bosons , ( di)quark quasiparticles ) of the matter in , e.g. , supernovae explosions or long - term cooling  @xcite .",
