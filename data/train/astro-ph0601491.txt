    "accreting binary pulsars are considered to have strong surface magnetic fields in the range of several times @xmath5 g. one of the methods to accurately measure their fields is to observe cyclotron resonance scattering features ( crsfs ) in their x - ray spectra , because the resonance energy @xmath6 and the magnetic field strength @xmath7 are related with each other as @xmath8 $ ] , where @xmath9 is the magnetic field strength in units of @xmath5 gauss and @xmath10 is the gravitational redshift .",

    "thus , 4u  0115 + 63 is one of the most suitable objects to study the physics of cyclotron resonance in the polar caps of binary x - ray pulsars .",
    "this source has been observed at various x - ray luminosity levels , and the fundamental resonance energy has been measured repeatedly at @xmath311 kev . however , in a minor outburst in april 1991 observed with _",
    ", when the 2@xmath060 kev luminosity ( 1.9@xmath1 erg s@xmath2 ) was @xmath37 times lower than those typical at the outburst peaks , a drastic change in the crsf was detected : instead of the familiar double absorption features at @xmath311 kev and @xmath322 kev , it exhibited a single deep and wide absorption at @xmath316 kev ( mihara 1995 ; mihara et al .",

    "we then selected the standard-2 mode data which have 16 s time resolution and 129 energy channels , and used only the top layer of the pca which has a low background .",

    ", we examined how the data - to - model ratio at each energy bin scatters among the pcus .",
    "form this , we have set the systematic error of the pcu to be 1 % .",
    "the subsequent results do not change if we instead use 0.5 % .",
    "for each dataset listed in table [ tab1 ] , we accumulated 3@xmath030 kev pcu data into a single spectrum , and 15@xmath050 kev hexte data into another .",
    "the background was subtracted in the way described in section 2 . in order to grasp the spectral shape in a model - independent manner without being hampered by the instrumental response , we surveyed these spectra normalized to that of the crab spectrum .",
    "the reference crab data are the same as utilized to estimate the systematic error .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig2 ] , where errors which propagated from the crab spectrum are negligible .    in figure",
    "[ fig2 ] , the first data set acquired on march 3 gives a relatively featureless spectral ratio .",
    "when the flux increased and exceeded 710 c s@xmath2 ( pcu)@xmath2 on march 5 , the crab ratio started to reveal two dip features at @xmath312 kev and @xmath325 kev .",
    "these can be interpreted as the fundamental and second harmonic , as have been observed repeatedly .",
    "the double absorption feature persisted throughout the flare peak until march 29 .",
    "however , when the flux decreased to @xmath17400 c s@xmath2 ( pcu)@xmath2 on april 2 , it turned into an apparently single absorption feature",
    ". thus , the present data appears to reconfirm the _",
    "results reported in paper 1 , that the crsf appears in double absorption when the x - ray intensity is high , while it changes into a single absorption as the source becomes faint . in the _ rxte _ data ,",
    "the threshold is suggested to lie between 400 and 710 c s@xmath2 ( pcu)@xmath2 .",
    "below , we attempt to quantitatively confirm these inspections .",
    "it is known that typical continuum spectra of accreting binary pulsars can be approximated with a power - law times exponential cutoff model . in this paper",
    ", we employ its updated version called npex ( negative and positive power - laws with exponential ) model ( mihara 1995 ; makishima et al .",
    "1999 ) , and fit the background - subtracted spectra in comparison with the results reported in paper 1 .",
    "the npex model is written as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the x - ray energy in units of kev , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the normalization and photon index of the negative power - law , respectively , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are those of the positive power - law , and @xmath24 represents the cutoff - energy in units of kev . in this paper",
    ", we tentatively fix @xmath23 at 2.0 , so that the positive power - law describes a wien peak ( rybicki & lightman 1979 ) .    figure [ fig3 ]",
    "shows the pulse - phase - averaged pca@xmath25hexte spectra obtained on march 27 and april 8 , when the crab ratio suggests the double and single crsf , respectively ( see figure [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "we first attempted to fit the spectra with the npex model . in order to take into account possible over- or under - subtraction of background",
    ", we allowed the background normalization to vary ( as described in the _ rxte cook book _ ) , so as to minimize the fit chi - squared .",
    "we found the optimum normalization factor to be close to the nominal value of 1.0 within a few percent . even allowing this correction ,",
    "the model left significant structures in data - to - model ratios as shown in figure [ fig3]d and g. as a result , the fits remained unacceptable with @xmath26 and @xmath27 for the march 27 and april 8 spectra , respectively .",
    "indeed , the march 27 spectrum exhibits two negative deviations at @xmath312 and @xmath322 kev from the npex fit , while that of april 8 shows only one negative feature around 16 kev .",
    "these results reconfirm the inference from the crab ratios .    in order to better reproduce the spectra",
    ", we next introduced a cyclotron absorption ( cyab ) factor which is given as @xmath28 where @xmath6 is the resonance energy , @xmath29 is the width of the absorption structure , and @xmath30 is the depth of the resonance ( mihara et al .",
    "we fitted the spectrum on march 27 with the npex continuum multiplied by two cyab factors ( hereafter npex@xmath31cyab2 model ) , in which all the npex and cyab parameters are left free except that the second crsf energy is fixed at twice the fundamental energy . for the spectrum on april 8",
    ", we applied the npex multiplied by a single cyab factor ( hereafter npex@xmath31cyab model ) .",
    "the pca@xmath25hexte data were fitted simultaneously with the same parameters , but using another free parameter to adjust relative normalizations of the two instruments .",
    "the background normalization was again allowed to vary , by up to @xmath32 % .",
    "we did not include low energy absorption nor fe - k line , since our spectra exhibit neither low - energy turn - offs nor an excess around 6.4 kev . the lack of significant fe - k line is often noticed among transient x - ray pulsars with be - type primary stars ( e.g. , nagase 1989 ) ; in such a system , the matter to be accreted by the pulsar presumably forms a disk - shaped envelope around the be star , and hence its solid angle as seen from the pulsar is much smaller than the case where the matter is captured from a more isotropic stellar wind .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig3]e and f , the npex@xmath31cyab model has successfully reproduced the pca@xmath25hexte data on april 8 , yielding reduced chi - squared of @xmath31.2 .",
    "the background correction factor turned out to be 0.3 % .",
    "in contrast , the march 27 spectrum was not reproduced successfully ( @xmath33 ) even by the npex@xmath31cyab2 model , because of negative residuals around 35 kev ( figure [ fig3]c ) .",
    "this feature was removed by multiplying a third cyab factor , of which the centroid energy is @xmath34 kev .",
    "since this energy is close to @xmath35 , the feature can be identified with the third harmonic resonance detected from the same outburst ( heindl et al .",
    "1999 ; santangelo et al .",
    "we hence fitted the march 27 spectrum with the npex continuum multiplied by three cyab factors , of which the resonance energies were constrained to have harmonic ratios ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "this model , hereafter called npex@xmath31cyab3 model , successfully reproduced the march 27 spectrum with @xmath37 .",
    "the derived fundamental resonance energy on march 27 is @xmath38 kev at an x - ray luminosity of 7.6@xmath39 erg s@xmath2 , while that of april 8 is @xmath40 kev at 3.0@xmath39 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "the resonance energy has thus increased by a factor of 1.4 as the luminosity decreased by a factor of 2.5 , although there still remains a possibility that the single crsf at 14.2 kev on april 8 is in reality the second harmonic .    while we tentatively fixed @xmath23 at 2.0 , santangelo et al .",
    "( 1999 ) obtained @xmath41 by analyzing the _ bepposax _ data of the same outburst .",
    "this is probably due to difference in the energy band used ; we fitted the spectra in the @xmath42 kev range , while santangelo et al .",
    "( 1999 ) in @xmath43 kev . to examine this difference , and to examine whether the constraint of @xmath44 is justifiable , we fitted the npex @xmath31 cyab3 model , with @xmath23 left free , to the pca@xmath25hexte data on march 19a , which is one of those with the highest statistics .",
    "then , this parameter has been constrained as @xmath45 , which includes the fiducial value of 2.0 .",
    "more specifically , fixing @xmath23 at 2.0 , at our best fit value of 1.60 , and at the _ bepposax _ value of 0.41 , gave a reduced chi - squared of 1.29 ( @xmath46 ) , 1.33 ( @xmath47 ) , and 1.67 ( @xmath46 ) , respectively .",
    "based on these results , we hereafter retain our initial assumption of @xmath44 .    apart from the continuum modeling , we must examine whether the crsf parameters we have derived are consistent with the previous analyses of the same outburst ( heindl et al .",
    "1999 ; santangelo et al .",
    "we therefore analyzed the pca@xmath25hexte spectra on march 11.36@xmath011.40 ( obs .",
    "7 ; table [ tab1 ] ) , in comparison with those reported by heindl et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for a particular pulse phase ( 0.70@xmath00.76 in terms of their phase convention ) on march 11.87@xmath012.32 .",
    "we found some difference in the resonance energy ; @xmath48 kev from our fit , while @xmath49 kev by heindl et al .",
    "the difference is likely to arise from the different modeling of the crsf employed in these studies , because heindl et al .",
    "( 1999 ) used a gaussian absorption model whereas we are using the cyab factor .",
    "accordingly , we re - fitted the same spectra with an npex model multiplied by two gaussian absorption models .",
    "the fundamental cyclotron resonance was then obtained at @xmath50 kev , which is consistent with heindl et al .",
    ". the higher accuracy of our result is probably because we analyzed the pulse phase - averaged spectra .",
    "other resonance parameters turned out to be consistent between the two works .",
    "we thus conclude that our results are consistent with those of heindl et al .",
    "( 1999 ) using the longer exposure , and have comparable accuracy .      for the moment",
    ", we mainly concentrate on the study of the 3@xmath030 kev pca spectra , because this energy range is most relevant to the crsfs . in order to more",
    "continuously resolve the drastic spectral change between march 27 to april 8 , we applied the npex model ( without incorporating cyab factors ) to the daily - averaged pcu0@xmath25pcu2@xmath25pcu3 spectra over this period .",
    "figure [ fig4]a shows ratios of the data to the best - fit npex model , which allow us to grasp the spectral changes objectively .",
    "the pca background normalizations were corrected in the way as described in section 3.2 .",
    "since the ratio on march 27 and 29 shows almost the same shape as figure [ fig3]d , we may consider that the two crsf persisted at least until march 29 . on march 31 ,",
    "the second crsf became less clear , and on april 2 onward , the ratio reveals only a single absorption .",
    "in addition , the fundamental resonance initially observed at @xmath51 kev moved to higher energies , up to @xmath52 kev , while there is no opposite trend such as the two features drifting toward lower energies .    in order to quantify the results of these visual inspections ,",
    "we have fitted the same set of spectra with the npex@xmath31cyab2 ( or npex@xmath31cyab ) model .",
    "the obtained best - fit parameters are summarized in table [ tab2 ] , and the ratio of the data to the model are plotted in figure [ fig4]b .",
    "the spectra from march 27 through april 2 all required the two cyab factors , because the double cyab fit gave a significantly better reduced chi - square ( 0.6@xmath31.2 ) than the single cyab case ( @xmath532 ) .",
    "on april 4 , the spectrum is roughly reproduced by the single cyab model , although there remains a hump at @xmath323 kev which does not disappear by including the second cyab factor .",
    "the successful single cyab fit continued to the end , on april 8 .",
    "these results quantitatively confirm our inference made above , that the fundamental crsf energy increased from 10 to 15 kev over this @xmath310 day period as assumed in paper 1 , although details of the change are not yet resolved clearly .",
    "although the 3@xmath030 kev spectrum apparently depends on the luminosity , the source exhibits significant intra - day variations , as shown in figure [ fig5 ] . as a result ,",
    "each spectrum in figure [ fig4 ] , in reality , is an average over a relatively wide luminosity range . in order to see the luminosity dependence more clearly , we sorted the pca data from march 27 to april 8 into 8 intensity intervals , in reference to figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "we again used data from pcu 0 , 2 and 3 , which worked throughout this period .",
    "then , we have repeated the same analysis as performed in section [ sec:3.3 ] .",
    "figure [ fig6]a shows the ratios of these intensity - sorted spectra to their best - fit npex models , to be compared with figure [ fig4]a .",
    "the two crsfs , at @xmath311 kev and @xmath322 kev , are thus observed clearly in the higher four intensity levels , f1 through f4 .",
    "as the intensity decreased , the second crsf gradually became shallower .",
    "finally , the second crsf disappeared at level f6 , and the fundamental crsf started to move from @xmath311 to @xmath316 kev over levels f5 through f8 . from these results ,",
    "we confirm that the @xmath316 kev single structure results from an upward shift of the @xmath310 kev fundamental crsf . the spectral changes revealed here are consistent with , but clearer than , those seen between april 2 and april 4 in the date - sorted spectra .",
    "using the npex@xmath31cyab2 ( or npex@xmath31cyab ) model , we quantified the crsf parameters as a function of the intensity .",
    "the fitting results are summarized in table [ tab3 ] , and the ratios of the data to the model are shown in figure [ fig6]b .",
    "the full fitting results are displayed in figure [ fig7 ] .",
    "the two cyab factors have been required by the f1 to f4 spectra .",
    "the second crsf is not clearly visible in the f5 ratio ( figure [ fig6]a and figure [ fig7 ] ) , but a large @xmath54 ( @xmath32.0 ) was obtained by the single cyab fitting .",
    "we therefore applied the npex@xmath31cyab2 model to the f5 spectrum , and obtained a fully acceptable fit ( table [ tab3 ] ) .",
    "this means that the second harmonic is still present in the f5 spectrum , with a reduced depth ( @xmath55 ) . from f1 through f5 ,",
    "both @xmath56 and @xmath57 decreased ; that is , the second harmonic feature became narrower and shallower .",
    "although this behavior is absent in the day - sorted results ( table [ tab2 ] ) , the difference can be attributed to the fact that each day - average spectrum is a mixture of different spectra corresponding to different intensities .",
    "the f6 through f8 spectra have been fitted successfully by the npex@xmath31cyab model .",
    "these results unambiguously show that the center energy of the fundamental crsf moved from 10 to 15 kev as the luminosity decreased .",
    "thus , we can conclude that the 16 kev spectral structure of 4u  0115 + 63 observed by _ ginga _ ( 1991 ) and this work is the fundamental crsf , rather than the second harmonic resonance which moved toward lower energies .",
    "the threshold between the single and double crsf structures is found at a @xmath58 kev luminosity of @xmath34.2@xmath1 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "now that we have understood the basic behavior of the crsfs , we now proceed to the analysis of the entire pca and hexte data prepared in section 3.1 . since the crab ratios on march 3 and 4 do not show clear crsfs ( figure [ fig2 ] ) , we first attempted an npex fitting , but the model was unacceptable ( @xmath59 ) , because of the negative deviation at @xmath52 kev .",
    "then we applied the npex@xmath31cyab model to these data , but the fit was still unacceptable ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "finally , we fitted these data with the npex@xmath31cyab2 model , and obtained reasonable fit with @xmath61 .",
    "these results imply that the double crsfs were already present in these early data sets , with the fundamental resonance at @xmath62 kev as given in table [ tab4 ] .",
    "thus , the data from the beginning through april 2 were generally well described with the npex@xmath31cyab2 model . by jointly analyzing the pca and hexte data , the second crsf parameters have been significantly better constrained than using the pca data alone .",
    "the derived parameters are listed in table [ tab4 ] .",
    "in some fits , however , we were still left with rather large values of @xmath54 .",
    "for example , the npex@xmath31cyab2 fits are rather poor ( @xmath63 ) on march 15 , 19a , 21a , 22 , 27 , 29 and 31 ( table [ tab4 ] ) , often with negative residuals at @xmath335 kev . like in figure",
    "[ fig3]b , these residuals can be mostly removed by multiplying the model with a third cyab factor .",
    "typical parameters of the third crsf , e.g. , observed on march 19a , are @xmath64 kev , @xmath65 kev and @xmath66",
    ". we can hence identify it with the third harmonic , after section 3.2 .",
    "the third harmonic persisted in the spectra for about half a month from march 15 , with relatively constant parameters , till march 31 when it became unconstrained presumably due to insufficient data statistics in higher energies .",
    "meantime , the second crsf stayed at around 22 kev .",
    "the data from april 3 to the end did not show the higher harmonics , with the npex@xmath31cyab model giving acceptable fits ( @xmath67 ) . in order to estimate the upper limits on the second harmonic feature",
    ", we attempted to fit the data obtained from april 3 to april 8 with the npex@xmath31cyab2 model .",
    "in addition to the constraint of @xmath68 employed so far , the second crsf width @xmath57 was tied to @xmath69 , because @xmath57 is close to @xmath69 ( except for april 1 and 2 ) when the spectrum exhibits the double features .",
    "the obtained upper limits on @xmath56 are given in table [ tab4 ] .    from these studies using the pca and hexte data",
    ", we reconfirmed that the cyclotron resonance energies increase as the x - ray luminosity decreases .",
    "these results are consistent with those derived in section 3.4 from the intensity - sorted study of the @xmath58 kev pca spectra .",
    "figure [ fig8 ] summarizes the fundamental resonance energies , derived through both the date - sorted and intensity - sorted analyses , as a function of the calculated @xmath42 kev luminosity at 7 kpc .",
    "we have analyzed the 34 pca@xmath25hexte datasets , covering the whole 1999 march - april outburst of 4u  0115 + 63 in which the @xmath42 kev source luminosity changed over @xmath70 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "when @xmath71 erg s@xmath2 , we observed the familiar double crsfs with @xmath72 kev .",
    "as @xmath73 decreased across a rather narrow range of @xmath74 erg s@xmath2 , the second harmonic resonance disappeared , and the fundamental resonance energy increased from @xmath75 kev to @xmath76 kev .",
    "these results reconfirm paper 1 , and unambiguously reveal that the resonance energy _",
    "increases _ as the source gets less luminous .      except for some hysteresis effects between the rising and decay phases of the outburst ,",
    "@xmath77 changes roughly as a single - valued function of @xmath73 . in particular , the intensity - sorted 3@xmath030 kev pca spectra and the date - sorted pca@xmath25hexte data imply consistent results .",
    "furthermore , the _ ginga _ results reported in paper 1 fall on the same @xmath77 vs. @xmath73 relation .",
    "therefore , the phenomenon is inferred to have a good reproducibility as a function of the luminosity .",
    "the crsf is known to depend also on the pulse phase , presumably because different scattering regions characterized by slightly different magnetic field strengths are observed as the neutron star rotates .",
    "when studying luminosity - related changes in the resonance energy , such pulse - phase dependent effects must be considered . in the case of 4u  0115 + 63 , however , the phase dependent variation of @xmath77 in the 1999 outburst was relative small , @xmath78% ( santangelo et al .",
    "furthermore , the phase - resolved analysis performed in paper 1 , on the two different luminosity levels , did not affect the main results from the phase - averaged spectroscopy .",
    "we therefore concentrate , in the present paper , on the phase - averaged analysis .    as mentioned in paper 1 , luminosity - dependent changes of the accretion column height provide the most likely explanation to our results , because the column is expected to become taller as the source luminosity increases ( e.g. , burnard et al .",
    "1991 ) . assuming that the crsf is formed at a height @xmath79 above the neutron star surface in the accretion column , and the magnetic field strength there",
    "follows the dipole law , we then expect @xmath80 with @xmath81 the radius of the neutron star .",
    "the factor @xmath82 describes the gravitational redshift , but below we assume @xmath83 for simplicity .",
    "then , the relative resonance height , @xmath84 , can be related to the resonance energy as @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the resonance energy to be observed on the neutron star surface .    substituting the observed value of @xmath77 into equation ( [ eq4 ] ) ,",
    "we have calculated @xmath84 as a function of the x - ray luminosity .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig9 ] . since there is no _ a priori _ knowing of @xmath87 , we employed two different values of @xmath87 ; 18 kev and 20 kev , the former close to the observed maximum value of @xmath77 . except for some differences between the two assumptions on @xmath87 ,",
    "the height @xmath79 thus increases in a rough proportion to the x - ray luminosity , up to @xmath88 erg s@xmath2 where @xmath79 appears to saturate at @xmath89 .",
    "in addition , @xmath84 may approach a finite value of @xmath90 , instead of zero , as @xmath73 decreases below @xmath91 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "the results presented in figure [ fig9 ] may be compared to a theoretical prediction by burnard et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , who calculated the height of the accretion column @xmath92 as @xmath93 here , @xmath94 is the eddington luminosity along the magnetic field which is identical to the conventional eddington luminosity for a @xmath95 neutron star , @xmath96 ergs s@xmath2 , and @xmath97 is the ratio of the thomson cross section to the rosseland - averaged electron scattering cross section for radiation flows across the magnetic fields .",
    "the dashed line in figure [ fig9 ] shows this prediction , assuming @xmath98 ( paper 1 ) and @xmath99 km . except for the observed saturation toward the highest luminosity and @xmath100 erg s@xmath2",
    ", the value of @xmath79 measured at each luminosity level thus corresponds to @xmath101 of the predicted @xmath92 .",
    "this is quite reasonable , because the resonance energy is expected to sample the magnetic field strength which is measured at , or slightly below , the top of the column ( i.e. , @xmath102 )",
    ".    so far , we have assumed that the observed x - ray intensity changes are caused solely by actual variations of the intrinsic source luminosity .",
    "however , the intensity may also be affected by other extrinsic factors , such as partial obscuration by materials around the accretion disk .",
    "such effects are known , e.g. , in her x-1 ( mihara et al .",
    "1991 ) . in the present outburst of 4u  0115 + 63 , heindl et al .",
    "( 1999 ) detected occasional appearance of `` mhz qpo '' , with a period of @xmath103 sec and intensity changes up to @xmath104 % , and suggested that the phenomenon is possibly due to source obscuration by some ionized materials .",
    "if so , we would need a caution in interpreting the results from our intensity - sorted analysis .    in order to investigate effects of the mhz qpo on our results , we inspected pca light curves acquired over the period used for our intensity - sorted analysis ( march 27 through april 8) .",
    "as shown in the inset to figure [ fig10 ] , a relatively clear qpo was found on march 31 , although the period is about 1000 sec instead of the 500 sec reported by heindl et al .",
    "then , we sliced the light curves as shown there , and produced a pair of pca spectra corresponding to peaks and valleys of the qpo .",
    "figure [ fig10 ] presents these spectra and their ratio , as well as residuals when fitted individually with the npex model .",
    "the resonance energy thus clearly increases at the qpo valley . by fitting the spectra with the npex times cyab2 model ( with @xmath57 again fixed at @xmath69 ) ,",
    "we have constrained the resonance centroid as @xmath105 kev at the qpo peak with @xmath106 erg s@xmath2 , and @xmath107 kev at the qpo bottom with @xmath108 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "thus , the energy shift is statistically significant .",
    "furthermore , these two data points line up in figure [ fig8 ] closely on the general @xmath73 vs. @xmath77 correlation from the day - sorted and intensity - sorted analysis .",
    "we hence conclude that our basic results remain unaffected , and that the qpo , at least on this occasion , is likely to reflect real changes in the intrinsic luminosity rather than some obscuration effects .",
    "this inference is reinforced by the relatively flat spectral ratio , because the ratio should show an increased low - energy absorption if the obscuration were due to neutral material , or fe - k edge feature if it were highly ionized .",
    "so far , many authors ( e.g. paper 1 and coburn et al .  2002 ) studied relations among the continuum and cyclotron line parameters .",
    "our work provides a valuable opportunity to investigate how these parameters in a single system change in correlated ways , when the resonance energy varies . among various correlations ,",
    "a particularly interesting one is that between @xmath30 and the @xmath109 ratio ; in fact , coburn et al .",
    "( 2002 ) found a positive correlation between them over a large sample of phase - averaged spectra of x - ray pulsars .",
    "later , kreykenbohm et al .  ( 2004 ) noticed that the same correlation holds for the phase - resolved spectra of gx  301 - 2 , and argued that the correlation may be explained if the accretion column has a tall cylindrical shape rather than flat coin - shaped geometry .",
    "as presented in figure [ fig11 ] , the fundamental and second harmonic widths of 4u  0115 + 63 from the present observations both depend positively on their respective resonance depths , in agreement with the correlation found by coburn et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . these results , together with the argument by kreykenbohm et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , strengthen the tall cylindrical column geometry which we invoked in   4.1 . for reference",
    ", we did not find particular correlations between @xmath110 and @xmath24 , or between @xmath110 and @xmath29 .",
    "figure  [ fig12 ] shows the spectral parameters as a function of the x - ray luminosity .",
    "there , the positive @xmath30 vs. @xmath109 correlation of figure  [ fig11 ] has been decomposed into luminosity dependent changes in @xmath109 ( panel a ) and @xmath30 ( panels c , d ) . up",
    "to @xmath111 erg s@xmath2 , @xmath112 thus stays relatively constant , with a hint of mild increase presumably due to the increased column density in the emission region . over the same luminosity range ,",
    "the fractional width @xmath113 increases more clearly .",
    "this would not be due to changes in the doppler broadening ( e.g. mszros 1992 ) , since the npex @xmath24 parameter shown in figure  [ fig12]b , which is thought to approximate the electron temperature in the emission region ( mihara et al .",
    "2004 ; makishima et al .",
    "1999 ) , stays rather constant .",
    "instead , the increase in the @xmath113 ratio could be a result of the luminosity - correlated elongation in the accretion column , which would cause a larger range of magnetic field intensities to participate in the resonance formation .    beyond @xmath111 erg s@xmath2 ,",
    "both @xmath112 and @xmath113 start decreasing clearly , while the 2nd harmonic resonance develops rapidly both in depth ( @xmath56 , figure [ fig12]d ) and relative width ( @xmath114 in figure [ fig12]a ) . in short ,",
    "the crsf makes a transition from the single feature at low luminosities to the harmonic double feature at higher luminosities .",
    "since this occurs approximately over the luminosity range where the rapid change in @xmath77 takes place , we consider that the single - to - double transition of the crsf has the same origin as the resonance energy shift .",
    "the behavior of the fundamental and 2nd harmonic parameters at the single - to - double transition may reflect basic differences in their elementary processes .",
    "the fundamental resonance has a very large cross section , but it acts as scattering rather than absorption , because an electron which is excited by absorbing a photon of energy @xmath115 will immediately return to the ground state by emitting a photon of nearly the same energy .",
    "the second harmonic resonance , though with a much smaller cross section , will in contrast act as pure absorption , because the electron excitation / deexcitation in this case occurs via absorption of a photon of energy @xmath116 and cascade emission of two photons of energies @xmath115 each .",
    "the emitted photons will fill up the fundamental resonance , making it shallower ( so - called two - photon effects ; alexander & meszaros 1991 ) . in the present case",
    ", the accretion column may be effectively thick to the fundamental resonance ( @xmath117 ) essentially at all the observed luminosities , but presumably optically thin ( @xmath118 ) to the second resonance photons when the luminosity is low and hence the accretion column is short . as the source luminosity increases ,",
    "the column becomes taller and opaque to the second resonance , leading to the emergence of the second resonance feature . at the same time",
    ", the two - photon effect would reduce @xmath112 , just as seen in figure [ fig12]c .",
    "a similar effect was observed in the _ integral _ spectrum of gx  @xmath119 by okada et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , who reported that @xmath112 of its @xmath120 kev crsf decreased toward higher luminosities .",
    "although 4u  0115 + 63 thus provides the first clear example of luminosity - dependent changes of the cyclotron resonance energy , there has emerged another promising case .",
    "this is the transient x - ray pulsar x0331 + 53 ( v0332 + 53 ) , from which a very prominent crsf was detected with _ ginga _ at @xmath121 kev together with a hint of the second harmonic ( makishima et al .",
    "this was observed in an outburst when the @xmath122 kev luminosity was @xmath91 erg s@xmath2 at an assumed distance of 3 kpc .",
    "a re - analysis of the same data using the npex continuum have revised the value slightly to @xmath123 kev ( makishima et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the object entered a bright outburst from 2004 november , becoming considerably more luminous than was observed with _",
    "( swank et al .  2004 ; remillard 2004 ) .",
    "observations with _ integral _ ( kreykenbohm et al .",
    "2005 ) and _ rxte _ ( coburn et al .",
    "2004 ) have clearly reconfirmed the fundamental crsf , and further revealed the second and third resonances . the fundamental resonance energy obtained with _",
    "integral _ is @xmath124 kev ( kreykenbohm et al . 2005 ) at a @xmath42 kev luminosity of @xmath125 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "this means that a factor 4 increase in the luminosity ( from the _ ginga _ outburst to the present one ) is accompanied by a @xmath126 decrease in @xmath77 .",
    "as mentioned by mihara et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , the same effect was already visible between two pointings with _",
    "ginga_. for comparison , the resonance energy of 4u  0115 + 63 changes by a somewhat larger amount ( @xmath127 ) across the same factor 4 luminosity range ( figure [ fig8 ] ) .",
    "the archival _ rxte _ data of x0331 + 53 are currently being analyzed , and the results will be reported elsewhere ( nakajima et al .  , in preparation ) .",
    "now , we have two examples of luminosity dependent changes in the resonance energy .",
    "however , there is an apparent counter example , namely her x-1 . in a large amount of _ rxte _ data covering its `` main on '' phase , the @xmath128 kev luminosity ( at 5.8 kpc ) of her x-1 varied by a factor of 2 over @xmath129 erg @xmath130 , but the crsf stayed at @xmath131 kev ( gruber et al .",
    "one possible interpretation of these results on her x-1 is that its luminosity swing was not large enough to reach the critical range ( _ cf .",
    "_ figure  [ fig8 ] ) where @xmath110 starts changing significantly .",
    "alternatively , the luminosity - related changes in the crsf may depend on the object , for some reasons which are yet to be detailed .    in conclusion ,",
    "our study using the _ rxte _ data has confirmed the inference made in paper 1 , that the cyclotron resonance energy of 4u  0115 + 63 increases as the x - ray luminosity decreases .",
    "while this provide a new tool with which we can diagnose the accretion column of strongly magnetized neutron stars , it remains yet to be confirmed whether the phenomenon is common among this type of objects .",
