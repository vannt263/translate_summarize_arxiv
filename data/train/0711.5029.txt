    "the present work is primarily concerned with the probability distribution function ( hereafter pdf ; some authors prefer to call this the probability density function ) , which describes the probability that a randomly placed cell of specified shape and volume contains a certain amount of mass . in",
    "the best studied cosmological models , the pdf has a gaussian form initially , but becomes increasingly positively skewed at later times .",
    "there are two methods for estimating the evolution of the dark matter pdf .",
    "one is based on perturbation theory @xcite and the other is based on excursion set methods @xcite .",
    "the perturbation theory based calculation is not expected to be accurate on scales where the variance is of order unity or larger ; in hierarchical models , this means that perturbation theory is not expected to be accurate on small scales .",
    "hyperextended perturbation theory ( hept ) @xcite is expected to be valid in the larger variance ( small cell ) regime where standard perturbation theory breaks down ; it provides explicit expressions for the moments of the pdf rather than a closed form expression . for the special case of clustering from white - noise gaussian initial conditions ,",
    "the excursion set method predicts exactly the same pdf as does hept , despite the fact that the methods used by the two approaches are very different .",
    "motivated by this coincidence , the purpose of the present note is twofold : first , to show that , for more general initial conditions , the excursion set approach actually makes rather similar predictions to those of perturbation theory on scales where the variance is small ; the second is to understand why .    in the analysis which follows ,",
    "we distinguish between two steps in the calculation of the pdf .",
    "the first is the approximation for nonlinear evolution which we will call the dynamics .",
    "the second is how this approximation is used to translate from the initial pdf to an evolved one , which we call the statistics . in the first half of this paper",
    ", we study approximations for the dynamics which are based on the assumption of spherical symmetry . in this case",
    ", the perturbation theory method provides what is , in effect , a monotonic , deterministic mapping between the initial and final overdensities .",
    "because the final overdensity at a specified position in space is determined solely by the initial value at that position , this is sometimes also called a ` local ' mapping , since values of the initial fluctuation field at other positions are assumed to not affect the mapping .",
    "the excursion set approach accounts for the fact that the evolution of a given region may actually be determined by less local surroundings .",
    "for example , consider the evolution of an underdense region which is surrounded by a dense shell . if the shell is sufficiently dense , then it will eventually collapse , crushing the smaller region within it .",
    "the local approximation would have predicted expansion rather than collapse for the smaller underdense region .",
    "sheth & van de weygaert ( 2004 ) call this the void - in - cloud problem , although it is clear that this is an extreme example of a more general ` cloud - in - cloud ' problem .",
    "clearly , in such cases , the mapping between initial and final overdensities is not as ` local ' as perturbation theory assumes , and accounting for this ` cloud - in - cloud ' problem is likely to be more important for small ` clouds ' .",
    "if not accounted for , this effect will manifest both as stochasticity ( since the same initial overdensity may map to many different final densities depending on the surroundings ) and , perhaps , as a bias .",
    "the excursion set approach provides an algorithm which accounts for this source of non - locality ; it assumes that , once the correct large scale has been chosen , the mapping is deterministic",
    ".    however , there is another source of non - locality which spherical evolution models ignore .",
    "this source plays a crucial role in models which account for the influence of the external shear field on the evolution .",
    "the simplest of these more sophisticated models for the dynamics is the zeldovich approximation @xcite . here",
    ", the nonlinear density is determined not just by the initial overdensity , but by two other quantities which are related to the surrounding shear field .",
    "these quantities also play an important role in extensions of the zeldovich approximation @xcite as well as in ellipsoidal collapse models @xcite . in all these models ,",
    "the nonlinear density is a deterministic function of three quantities associated with the initial fluctuation field . in the context of perturbation theory models for the pdf",
    ", the mapping from initial density to final density will appear to be stochastic if the influence of the two other variables is not accounted for .",
    "in the excursion set approach , this stochasticity is in addition to that which derives from the cloud - in - cloud problem which is now associated with all three variables .    to explore the consequences of this additional source of stochasticity we show the result of inserting the ellipsoidal collapse model into the perturbation theory and excursion set calculations .",
    "we do this in two steps : by showing the predictions when expanding the dynamics to first , and then to second order .",
    "to first order , the ellipsoidal collapse model reduces to the zeldovich approximation ; hence , our perturbation theory discussion of the first order approximation extends previous work on the zeldovich approximation @xcite",
    ". however , our analysis also accounts for another subtlety associated with non - spherical collapse models  that the final shape of a patch is different from its initial shape @xcite .",
    "we then present the results of the simplest excursion set treatment of this problem which accounts for the evolution in the volumes but not the shapes of cells .",
    "the perturbation theory and excursion set predictions associated with spherical dynamics are presented in section  [ models ] .",
    "this section also contains a discussion of the lognormal model .",
    "it includes a comparison of these predictions with measurements in simulations .",
    "the perturbation and excursion set treatments of the zeldovich and ellipsoidal collapse models are in section  [ stochastic ] .",
    "a final section summarizes our findings , and includes a discussion of the fact that local deterministic mapping models of nonlinear evolution motivate a simple method for reconstructing the shape of the initial pdf from that at late times .",
    "we illustrate the method using the spherical evolution model ; we also show that , for the present purposes , the spherical model is a good enough approximation to the second order ellipsoidal collapse dynamics .",
    "this section describes the perturbation theory and excursion set models of the pdf when the mapping from linear to nonlinear density is deterministic . in both",
    ", the variance of the initial density fluctuation field when smoothed on scale @xmath0 plays an important role .",
    "it is denoted by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the power spectrum of the initial field , @xmath3 is the fourier transform of the smoothing window , and @xmath4 .",
    "we will also use the quantity @xmath5 for @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "these methods make three important assumptions .",
    "first , an initial overdensity @xmath8 can be mapped to an evolved density @xmath9 . because @xmath9 at any given position in space is determined from @xmath8 at the same position ( in lagrangian coordinate ) , the mapping is said to be ` local ' . because @xmath9 depends on @xmath8 and nothing else ,",
    "the mapping is said to be ` deterministic ' .",
    "notice that these ` local ' ` deterministic ' assumptions make no mention of the scale on which they apply . in what follows , we will write the evolved density in a cell of volume @xmath10 , in units of the background density , as @xmath11 we hope that this slight abuse of notation will not cause confusion . since the evolved density is clearly smoothed on scale @xmath10 ,",
    "the question is : on what smoothing scale should the initial overdensity @xmath8 associated with @xmath9 be defined ? this is where the third key assumption is made : the appropriate scale is that which initially contains mass @xmath12 . as a result of this assumption ,",
    "the cumulative distributions of the evolved ( eulerian ) pdf at fixed @xmath10 and the initial ( lagrangian ) pdf at fixed mass scale @xmath12 are related as follows ( see section 5.4.3 in bernardeau et al .",

    ", the range of allowed @xmath21 relations is constrained by the relation @xmath22 , i.e. , by the initial power spectrum .      the excursion set model @xcite exploits the fact that @xmath23 is a monotonic function of @xmath12 , so the local collapse model @xmath21 defines a curve in the space of @xmath8 versus @xmath24 . in what follows , we will set @xmath25 .",
    "then , the excursion set model for the distribution of @xmath12 in cells of size @xmath10 is @xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes the probability that a random walk with uncorrelated steps first crosses a barrier of height @xmath28 on scale @xmath29 ( where @xmath29 denotes the variance in walk heights ) .",
    "the collapse dynamics is included in this solution of the statistical problem by setting @xmath30 .",
    "it is by relating the counts in cells distribution to the first crossing distribution that the excursion set model accounts for the ` cloud - in - cloud ' problem discussed in the introduction .",
    "note that this method allows a larger range of @xmath21 relations than does perturbation theory .",
    "we have used two methods for computing @xmath27 : one is a monte - carlo approach , where we simulate a large ensemble of random walks and count the distribution of first crossings , and the other is the analytical approximation of sheth & tormen ( 2002 ) .",

    "their expression is , essentially , yet another prediction for the spherical evolution based pdf .",
    "it fares substantially worse than either of our models - it overpredicts the high density tail - so we do not show it here .",
    "figure  [ fig : lgrho2prho1 - 4 ] shows that these spherical collapse based predictions remain accurate even on scales where the rms fluctuation is significantly larger than unity .",
    "this is well beyond the regime where standard perturbation theory is expected to be valid , and indeed , the perturbation and excursion set predictions for the high density tails differ significantly .",
    "perturbation theory provides a substantially better description of the simulations when the rms fluctuation is of order 2 ( left panel ) but is worse when the rms is larger ( right panel ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the average density within the virial radius of a dark matter halo is about 200 times the background density ; thus , in the regime where @xmath90 , the mapping of equation  ( [ eqn : scapprox ] ) is suspect .",
    "figures  [ fig : lgrho2prho ] and  [ fig : lgrho2prho1 - 4 ] show that the spherical model produces rather accurate predictions for the shape of the nonlinear pdf , at least on scales where the nonlinear rms fluctuation is smaller than about 2 .",
    "we show later that this can be used to motivate an algorithm which uses the nonlinear density field to provide an estimate of the initial pdf .",
    "in this section we replace the assumption of a spherical collapse in favor of the ellipsoidal collapse model .",
    "this evolution is considerably more complex , and so we only present results to first and second order in the dynamics .",
    "we use the formulation of this model in which it reduces , to lowest order , to the zeldovich approximation @xcite .      in the zeldovich approximation ,",
    "the nonlinear density is a deterministic function of three numbers in the initial distribution .",
    "these are the eigenvalues @xmath91 of the deformation tensor , a @xmath92 symmetric matrix whose elements are the second derivatives of the initial potential field .",
    "the initial density @xmath8 is the sum of the three eigenvalues , whereas the nonlinear density is @xmath93 ( note that @xmath94 when @xmath95 ) .",
    "all three eigenvalues are the same for a sphere , in which case @xmath96 . in this case",
    ", the relation above reduces to that of the spherical model from the previous section with @xmath97 .",
    "similarly , @xmath98 is associated with regions where the smallest eigenvalue is zero , and the other two are each equal to @xmath99 .",
    "if one calls such an object a filament , then a sheet has two eigenvalues equal to zero and the third equal to @xmath8 , so the evolution is given by equation  ( [ eqn : scapprox ] ) with @xmath59 .",
    "the evolved pdf of this model has @xmath100 @xcite .    for gaussian initial conditions ,",
    "the joint distribution of @xmath101 is known @xcite , and it is straightforward to evaluate the integral above by monte carlo methods . in practice , this distribution is a function of @xmath102 , so it is useful to think of the expression above as @xmath103 notice that if @xmath104 , then @xmath105 this choice is made by hui et al .",
    "( 2000 ) ; in this case , the normalization problems of section  [ norm ] do not arise .",
    "however , the analysis of the previous sections suggests that this ignores the effects of smoothing , and that setting @xmath106 is almost certainly a better choice @xcite .    notice",
    "that if any one of the eigenvalues equals unity then the density diverges , and that the density becomes negative if one and only one or all three eigenvalues exceed unity .",
    "this happens often when @xmath107 ( with probability 11% when @xmath108 ) , thus restricting the use of this approximation to large scales where @xmath89 is small .",
    "accounting for the effects of smoothing will mitigate this somewhat , since @xmath109 when @xmath110 , where we have defined @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "for simplicity , on the few occasions when the density does go negative , we take the absolute value of the _ rhs _ of equation  ( [ eqn : rhoza ] ) ; there is no physical motivation for this choice , but , in practice , this happens sufficiently rarely that it does not affect our results .",
    "the expression above is still not entirely self - consistent . although it tries to account for the fact that the final size of a region is different from its initial size , it does _ not _ account for the fact that the shape has also changed @xcite .",
    "if the final volume @xmath10 is spherical , the initial volume was not ; the analysis above does not account for this .",
    "however , this can be done in a relatively straightforward way by simply setting @xmath113 , where , for eulerian spheres @xmath10 of radius @xmath114 we require that @xmath115 .",
    "this means that the delta function picks out ellipsoids in the initial field which contained mass @xmath116 , and which are now spheres of volume @xmath10 which contain the same mass @xmath12 .",

    "the late time evolution in the ellipsodial collapse model is more complicated than in the zeldovich approximation @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we can still write the nonlinear density as a deterministic ( albeit complicated ) mapping of the three eigenvalues @xmath144 in the initial field .    thus , the non - linear density is given by an expression that is analogous to equation  ( [ eqn : rhoza ] ) .",

    "although the discrepancies at small @xmath9 are the most dramatic ( we discuss these in the next section ) , we are actually more interested in the region around the peak of the pdf : the bottom panels show clearly that the zeldovich approximation curves lie snake around the simulation results , whereas this sideways s - shaped residual is largely absent in the second order ellipsoidal collapse model .",
    "we discussed two approaches ( perturbation theory and excursion set ) for calculating the dark matter pdf using two different models for the dynamics ( spherical collapse and the zeldovich approximation ) in each case .",
    "although both approaches are deterministic , in the sense that the nonlinear evolution is determined by the initial conditions locally , the excursion set is slightly less ` local ' .",
    "we showed that both are expected to give similar predictions whenever the dynamics is approximated by local deterministic mappings ( equation  [ eqn : ptpdf ] ) , of which the spherical evolution model ( equation  [ eqn : scapprox ] ) is a special case ( figure  [ fig : besselk ] ) .",
    "the agreement is important , because the excursion set calculation allows one to connect discussions of the dark matter halo distribution with discussions of the pdf @xcite .",
    "both the perturbation and excursion set approaches , when combined with the spherical evolution model , provide good descriptions of the nonlinear pdf seen in simulations ( figures  [ fig : lgrho2prho ] and  [ fig : lgrho2prho1 - 4 ] ) .",
    "this agreement is slightly unexpected , in the sense that the spherical evolution model ignores the fact that the nonlinear evolution of a region may be determined by quantities other than its initial density .",
    "the ellipsoidal collapse model is a specific example of this ; we studied its first ( zeldovich approximation ) and second order expansions in some detail . in this model , the evolution of a patch is determined by its overdensity as well as the surrounding shear field ( only the overdensity matters for the spherical collapse model ) . as a result ,",
    "nonlinear evolution changes the shape as well as the volume of a patch ( in the spherical collapse model , only the volume changes ) .",
    "we found that including the evolution of the shapes is important when the density is high , so this is particularly important when the cell size is small .",
    "this shape dependence also complicates the excursion set calculation ( section  [ zel ] ) .    despite its increased complexity compared to the spherical evolution model",
    ", we found that the zeldovich approximation resulted in significantly worse agreement with the simulations ( figure  [ fig : lgrho2prhoza ] ) .",
    "going to second order in the ellipsoidal collapse model resulted in more accurate predictions , except in the lowest density regions .",
    "the relatively large discrepancies in underdense regions , in both models , may be related to the following fact .",
    "a taylor series in @xmath160 will converge more rapidly when @xmath161 than when @xmath162 , since the latter will be an oscillating series .",
    "thus , it may be that , to accurately represent the evolution of underdense regions , one must go beyond second order in the dynamics .",
    "presumably , going to even higher order would further improve agreement with the simulations ; this is the subject of work in progress .",
    "although our perturbation theory calculation accounts for the evolution of shapes , our excursion set calculation does not .",
    "this too is the subject of on - going work .",
    "the excursion set calculation is particularly interesting in view of the fact that the marriage of ellipsoidal collapse with the excursion set approach appears to provide a substantially improved prediction of dark halo abundances @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that our study of the real space pdf can be extended to redshift space ; we are in the process of extending previous work on this problem @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of the spherical collapse based predictions , and the fact that the associated deterministic mapping from initial to final overdensity also provides a good description of the mean mapping in the ellipsoidal collapse model ( figure  [ fig : ecmap ] ) , suggests that one might be able to estimate the shape of the initial pdf from a measurement of the evolved one as follows . starting from equation  [ eqn : scapprox ] and the normalization method in section  [ norm ] ,",
    "there is a mapping from the final density to its initial value . for each measured @xmath163 set @xmath164^{-1/\\delta_{\\rm c } } }              { \\sigma_{\\rm l}(m / n_{\\rm sc})/\\delta_{\\rm c } } ,   \\label{rescalenu}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the critical linear density associated with collapse in the spherical model , and @xmath165 is the corresponding normalization factor ( section  [ norm ] ) .",
    "then make a histogram of @xmath166 , but rather than having each cell count equally , weight each by its value of @xmath167 .",
    "the resulting distribution of @xmath166 should provide a good estimate of the shape of the initial pdf of @xmath168 .",
    "figure  [ fig : lineardm ] shows the results of this algorithm for a number of different scales .",
    "reconstruction of the initial pdf from the nonlinear pdf measured on scales larger than @xmath123mpc works rather well ( top panels ) .",
    "the reconstructed distributions trace the same gaussian shape very well ; for reference , the smooth black curve shows a gaussian with zero mean and unit variance .",
    "this mapping works well even when the cell size is as small as @xmath169mpc ( bottom left ) , but it fails at @xmath170mpc ( bottom right ) .",
    "the figure also shows that it is important to account for the factor of @xmath171 which relates eulerian and lagrangian statistics : weighting each cell in the nonlinear distribution equally would have lead one to conclude incorrectly that the reconstruction is biased even on very large scales . studying whether or not this is relevant for the mak reconstruction method",
    "@xcite is the subject of work in progress .    in effect , the spherical evolution model , when combined with the nonlinear pdf , is able to provide a good description of the initial pdf for scales where the rms fluctuation is smaller than about 2 . in principle , this might be used as the basis for a test of the gaussianity of the initial conditions because the algorithm makes no explicit assumption about the form of the distribution of @xmath166 .",
    "the fact that the nonlinear pdfs from a range of different scales all map back to the same zero mean , unit variance gaussian curve suggests that this method is a good test of gaussianity .",
    "although this is not the first method to reconstruct the shape of the initial one - point density field , it is simple and actually fares rather well compared to a number of previous methods ( e.g. kofman et al . 1994",
    "; narayanan & croft 1999 ) .",
    "this procedure is not as good a test of non - gaussianity , in the sense that it does not yield a simple estimate of the shape of the initial distribution if it were non - gaussian .",
    "this is because the reconstruction requires an estimate of the normalization factor @xmath165 , and to calculate it , one must first specify the form of the initial distribution .",
    "so the algorithm above is really a self - consistency check : it checks if the assumed form of the initial pdf is consistent with that reconstructed from the measured nonlinear pdf , under the assumption that spherical evolution is a good model whatever the initial fluctuation field .",
    "of course , rescaling to @xmath166 involved a rescaling and transformation of the measured @xmath12 , but it also involved @xmath172 ; this is a consequence of the fact that , for gaussian fluctuations , information about the volume enters only through the scale dependence of the rms value .",
    "for more general distributions this may not remain true , in which case the mapping to the initial variable @xmath8 may be more complicated than equation  ( [ rescalenu ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , figure  [ fig : lineardm ] suggests that this may be an interesting avenue to explore in future work .",
    "we are in the process of extending this method to include redshift space effects , as well as galaxy bias .",
    "we believe it may be interesting to merge it with the method recently proposed by eisenstein et al .",
