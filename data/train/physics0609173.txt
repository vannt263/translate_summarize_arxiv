    "<S> although the vector - field image of an electromagnetic dipole in a high numerical aperture confocal microscope has been known for some time @xcite , only recently have the light gathering properties of the instrument been studied . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , the collection efficiency function for a confocal microscope based on a hard - stop aperture was defined and studied by enderlein @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such a confocal microscope is sensitive to field intensity and the detected optical power is obtained by integrating the component of the dipole image field poynting vector that is perpendicular to the hard - stop aperture over the aperture area . </S>",

    "<S> fiber - based confocal microscopes are routinely employed in the study of silicon integrated circuits @xcite , single semiconductor quantum dots @xcite and other nanoscale light emitters , it is of great practical interest to understand the light collection properties of the fiber - based instrument . here </S>",
    "<S> , we will extend the previous studies by using the angular spectrum representation ( asr)@xcite to study the coupling of dipole radiation into a single - mode optical fiber @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> for the calculation below , we assume the optical system illustrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] is aplanatic . in what follows </S>",
    "<S> , we refer to reference sphere 1 as the collection objective and reference sphere 2 as the focusing objective . </S>",

    "<S> we make the weakly guiding approximation@xcite and assume the cladding refractive index , @xmath43 , is nearly equal to the core refractive index , @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> the utility of the weakly guiding approximation is that the propagating mode solutions for the fiber , @xmath45 , are linearly polarized ( along the direction indexed by @xmath24 ) . for each propagating solution , characterized by propagation constant @xmath46 , </S>",
    "<S> there exist two orthogonal , linearly polarized modes typically referred to as the @xmath47 modes . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , for a fiber with core radius @xmath48 , the single - mode fiber electric field solutions are@xcite    @xmath49    where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the transverse wavenumbers in the fiber core and cladding , @xmath52 is the fiber @xmath53-parameter , @xmath54 is the order @xmath55 modified bessel function of the second kind , @xmath56 is the characteristic impedance of the fiber core and the solution for the orthogonally polarized solution is obtained by interchanging @xmath57 with @xmath58 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : exsmf ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> next , we apply the previous formalism to study the collection efficiency of a fiber - based confocal microscope . </S>",
    "<S> first , we position the dipole in a region of refractive index @xmath59 at the focus ( equal to the coordinate origin ) of a @xmath60 collection objective and calculate the collection efficiency @xmath61 , averaged over a uniform distribution of dipole orientations in the object space , as a function of @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the single - mode fiber core radius is fixed to @xmath62 ( @xmath63 is the wavelength of the dipole radiation ) and the fiber @xmath53-parameter is equal to 1.03 . for the case of the two linearly polarized fiber modes , </S>",
    "<S> the collection efficiency is expressible as an incoherent sum of the contribution from each fiber polarization mode @xmath64 ( we assume the modes are linearly polarized along the @xmath57 and @xmath58 directions ) . </S>",
    "<S> the result is the solid black line decorated with squares plotted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](a ) , showing that the maximum collection efficiency is obtained when the ratio of the two objective focal lengths @xmath65 ( corresponding to an optical system magnification of @xmath66 ) . at this focal length ratio , </S>",
    "<S> we calculate a coupling efficiency of approximately fifty - one percent . from our definition of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : ceff ] ) , fifty - one percent of the dipole radiation that enters the microscope image space is coupled into the single - mode optical fiber .    fixing the magnification to @xmath66 , and keeping @xmath29 of the collection objective equal to 1.2 </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate collection efficiency @xmath67 when the dipole is displaced in the object space . </S>",
    "<S> the results are presented in fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig2](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](b ) displays linecuts along @xmath57 @xmath68 and @xmath69 @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> we find a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of approximately @xmath71 along the @xmath57-direction and approximately @xmath72 along the axis of the microscope . </S>",
    "<S> the product of these numbers provides us with a rough estimate of the dipole radiation collection volume ( three - dimensional optical resolution ) for this fiber - based confocal microscope . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the number is approximately @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> we also studied the transverse resolution ( along the @xmath57-direction ) of the optical system by calculating the fwhm as the focal length ratio was varied around the value that resulted in maximum collection efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> the solid black line in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](a ) is the result of the calculation . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the minimum of the fwhm ( the optimal resolution ) does not coincide with the maximum of collection efficiency . at the focal length ratio @xmath13 that maximizes the collection efficiency </S>",
    "<S> the transverse resolution is approximately nine percent larger than the optimal transverse resolution . finally , for comparison , the solid vertical line in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](a ) is both the collection efficiency and transverse resolution when @xmath74 where @xmath75 for the assumed single - mode fiber . by choosing the focal length ratio to match the refractive index - scaled numerical aperture ratio , </S>",
    "<S> the ability of the resulting optical system to collect radiation from the dipole is maximized .    in summary , for a set of fixed optical system constraints </S>",
    "<S> , we find that there is a particular value of another system parameter that optimizes the overlap of the conjugated dipole image field amplitude with the fiber mode profile and maximizes the collection efficiency as defined in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : ceff ] ) . in the example here , for fixed collection objective numerical aperture and single - mode fiber characteristics , there is a particular value of the objective focal length ratio @xmath13 that maximizes the collection efficiency @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> however , fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](a ) makes clear that in constructing a fiber - based confocal microscope there is a compromise between instrument collection efficiency and optical resolution . </S>",
    "<S> it is important in system design to determine which figure of merit , collection efficiency or resolution , is most important . </S>"
