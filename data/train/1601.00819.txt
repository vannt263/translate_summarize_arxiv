    "hundreds of 2 - 3 inch photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) are used in these detectors for the accurate measurement of scintillation light from liquid argon ( 128 nm shifted to 420 nm ) and liquid xenon ( 170 nm ) . a prerequisite for the next generation multi - ton scale noble liquid experiments to reach the",

    "photomultipliers as scintillation light readout devices and cryostat shells and flanges represent the largest sources of radioactive background for current experiments .",
    "while the radioactive background budget is the primary issue , it is not the only difficulty inherent in using pmt technology as it stands today . in particular for the liquid argon case",
    ", current cryogenic pmts ( r11065 and r10065 - 20 ) do not fully match the requirements of future experiments in terms of performance .",
    "we propose a brand new concept of detector for dark matter search : the geiger - mode avalanche photodiode time projection chamber * ( gap - tpc)*. the gap - tpc is designed to achieve : a very high light collection , an exceptional single photon resolution and a sub - cm spatial resolution on the xy plane that will considerably improve the surface background rejection .    the larger photosensitive coverage of the detector surfaces needed to reach the high design light yield requires a significant increase of the number of photodetectors .",
    "our idea is to use sipm arrays that are virtually radioactivity free , given the reduced mass and provided they are packaged with radiopure materials .",
    "in addition , they allow for cost effective large productions .",
    "the use of sipms reduces the complexity of the detector because they need a common low bias voltage to operate , with no need for high voltage feedthroughs and cables .",
    "moreover , sipm compactness reduces to the minimum the amount of passive liquid argon ( lar ) around the detector and opens up the possibility of increasing the photocathodic coverage of the tpc .",
    "given the above considerations , we propose a @xmath3 design to directly convey the photons to the photosensors with the highest efficiency without any use of reflectors .",
    "addtoresetfootnotesection    the gap - tpc is a @xmath3 photocatodic coverage liquid argon time projection chamber detector that uses sipm arrays ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : gap - tpc_detector ] ) . the @xmath3 design allows for the direct convey of the photons to the photosensors with the highest efficiency without any use of reflectors and for maximizing the photocathodic coverage .",
    "a fused silica vessel defines the active volume . to the bottom part of the cylinder",
    "is placed the cathode , an ito coated - fused silica window . on the top part",
    ", there is the grid for extracting ionization electrons to the gas pocket , the `` diving bell '' for creating the gas region as well as a second ito coated - fused silica window acting as an anode .",
    "the drift field is applied between the cathode and the anode and is kept uniform along the drift coordinate by means of field shapers . in conventional lar tpcs",
    "the shapers are metallic rings encapsulating the drift region .",
    "this solution is not applicable to a @xmath4 coverage .",
    "our idea is to realize the field shaping rings by thin coating the walls of the fused silica vessel with ito ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gap - tpc_detector ] ) .",
    "finally , a wavelength shifter ( tpb ) is carefully deposited on the vessel and planar surfaces to convert the ar 128  nm scintillation light to 420  nm .",
    "the ito very high transparency to visible light , together with the @xmath4 optical readout and the overall larger qe of the sipm ( @xmath550% ) with respect to cryogenic pmts ( < 40% ) allows for the expected significant increase in the total light collection .",
    "there are conceivable implementations of this design that can be scaled up to very large volumes .",
    "an example of the bottom photosensor plane of a gap - tpc prototype with an internal cylindrical shape is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : top_array ] . the compactness of the sipms with respect to pmts reduces to minimum the amount of passive lar around the detector increasing the ratio of active / not - active argon contained in the cryostat .",
    "the top and bottom photosensor planes can be composed of different sipm array units .",
    "for the lateral coverage of a cylindrical region one can foresee vertical slim arrays to be installed all around the fused silica cylinder to achieve the @xmath4 coverage .",
    "sipms give an additional advantage . the readout pattern of the photosensors top array can be chosen depending on the needs .",
    "as example , sipms can be readout with higher granularity nearby the edges of the tpc where the xy resolution is key to enhance surface background rejection and with much less granularity in the center of the top plane where high resolution on the position reconstruction is not needed .",
    "it is not trivial to sum up the output of sipm dies .",
    "a possibility is the analog sum of multiple sipm dies ( e.g. summing up 64 sipm output and reading out with a single cable ) by means of a cryogenic transimpedance amplifier .",
    "important results on this matter have been already published in our previous work  @xcite .",
    "an embryonal gap - tpc has been equipped at the infn napoli cryogenic laboratories to compare the performance at the liquid argon temperature of a cryogenic hamamatsu 3  inch r11065 pmt and a 6@xmath66  @xmath1 sensl - arrayc-60035 - 64p sipm array .",
    "the lar detector prototype has an active volume bounded by a ptfe cylinder of 100  mm height and 57  mm internal diameter .",
    "an enhanced specular reflector ( lumirror foils ) was coated with the tpb wavelength shifter in use for darkside-50 experiment  @xcite and rested against the internal wall of the ptfe cylinder .",
    "the detector was equipped with the two photosensors : the pmt installed on the top of the ptfe cylinder and the sipm array installed on the bottom of the cylinder ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gap_prototype ] ) .",
    "the sipm array is composed of 64 individual sipms of 6.0@xmath66.0  mm@xmath2 active area ( 7.2@xmath67.2  mm@xmath2 total surface area ) , each containing 18980 @xmath7-cells of 35@xmath635  @xmath7 m amounting to a total active area of 57.2@xmath657.2  mm@xmath2 .",
    "both photosensors were coated with uniform and similar layers of tpb .",
    "the choice of the ptfe internal diameter was made to ensure that the openings at both ends were fully covered by the photosensing area , in order to ease the comparison of the individual light yields .",
    "the detector is housed in a double wall stainless steel cryostats that contain the cryogenic liquid . a top flange vacuum - seals the cryostat through an indium wire .",
    "the flange hosts a series of additional smaller flanges and feedthroughs needed to evacuate the inner volume of the vessel , to fill in the liquid , to read - out the detector signals , to supply the bias voltage , to house the pressure monitors , level meter and safety valves , and to provide the transport of laser beams to the inner part of the tpc , used as a calibration and monitoring tool for the photosensors .",
    "light pulses are generated by a hamamatsu plp10 light pulser , equipped with a 408  nm laser head with a pulse width of 70  ps .",
    "the laser beam is passed through an optical attenuator mount in which discrete filters of different attenuation coefficients were used to select the magnitude of illumination reaching the photosensors .",
    "after the attenuator , a custom made 1x2 fiber splitter brings the laser light to cryostat .",
    "two internal fibers are installed at different heights along the vertical direction of the ftpe cylinder , one nearby the pmt and the other one nearby the sipm array , to ensure both photosensors to be reached by the laser light .    before the data taking starts , the cryostat is pumped out until a residual pressure of 10@xmath8",
    "mbar is reached .",
    "then , the lar filling operation starts",
    ". commercial argon gas is flown through a commercial getter ( oxysorb ) in order to remove impurities ( mainly oxygen , nitrogen and water ) before to be inserted in the cryostat .",
    "the level of the liquid argon in the cryostat is monitored with two pt1000 resistors , readout by a calibrated cryocon 32 controller .",
    "the first pt1000 ( low level ) is placed below the sipm array readout electronic board , while the second one ( high level ) is placed a few cm above the pmt base .",
    "the liquid argon filling operation is stopped 15  min after the high level is reached .",
    "the lar level is continuously monitored in order to ensure constant thermodynamical conditions during the data taking .",
    "the bias voltage was supplied via a low noise power supply through a 10  k@xmath9 resistor .",
    "the sipm array was coupled to a custom made cryogenic board able to sum up 32 + 32 sipm outputs with only two channels , developed at the electronic workshop of infn napoli .",
    "the two outputs of the readout board are conveyed outside the cryostat through a signal feedthrough flange and are fed to an external ( custom made ) nim amplifier ( gain x10 ) .",
    "the output of the amplifier is fed in to a caen v1720e digitizer with 4  ns sampling and 12  bit resolution , connected via optical link to a pc for data handling , storage and analysis .",
    "the single photoelectron ( spe ) response of the photosensors have been measured and monitored during the data taking .",
    "each data taking run consisted of 100,000 triggers at a given v@xmath10 , with a memory buffer of 5  @xmath7s , with 2  @xmath7s pre - trigger .",
    "the laser was triggered by an external pulser at a repetition rate of 10  khz and its illumination was set , through a system of discrete attenuators in order to send a few photons for each trigger to the photosensor . the single photoelectron spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spe ] ) , was reconstructed integrating the waveform region around the trigger for 800  ns ) . ] for a given run .",
    "in addition , a measurement of the influence of cross - talk and afterpulsing on photodetection characteristics has been performed on the sipm array .",
    "the method used is described in  @xcite .    during the data taking ,",
    "the operational voltage for the pmt was set to 1250  v , while the operational voltage for the sipm array was set to v@xmath11=6.3  v ( overvoltage ) , where the probability of correlated pulses were evaluated to be @xmath1225% .",
    "the gap - tpc prototype was calibrated with the use of an am-241 gamma - ray source ( 59.5  kev ) .",
    "the source was placed outside the cryostat in a lead collimator of cylindrical size of 10  mm diameter and 30  mm length , pointing towards the geometrical center of the active detector , at the same distance between the pmt and the sipm array .",
    "the overall light yield was found to be ly=9.9  pe / kev .",
    "the pmt light yield was ly=4.4  pe / kev while the sipm array achieved y=5.5  pe / kev ( fig .  [ fig : ly ] ) .",
    "the measured value of ly of the gap - tpc prototype set a record for liquid argon detectors , being 20% higher of what achieved so far by the darkside-50 detector .",
    "furthermore , with this test we have also demonstrated that the sensl sipm array has a light yield about 20% greater than the pmt .",
    "sipm technology is evolving very fast , so it is very reasonable to predict an increase of their qe in the near future .",
    "sipms look to be very promising devices for next generation noble liquids direct dark matter search experiments .",
    "sipm arrays sizes are nowadays comparable to pmts of 3 inch size .",
    "the manufacture progress of last years have made sipms arrays very appealing for substituting pmts in cryogenic environment .",
    "in particular , sensl - arrayc-60035 - 64p can be operated at liquid argon temperature coupled with a cryogenic readout amplifying board , to reduce the number of output channels without distorting the pulse shape .",
    "we assembled and operated in liquid argon the gap - tpc prototype .",
    "the calibration of the detector resulted in a record light yield of ly=9.9  pe / kev .",
    "the sipm array showed much better performance with respect to the pmt in terms of light collection .",
    "light collection is the key figure of merit for a lartpc , driving the numerical performance of the strong intrinsic pulse shape discrimination of lar .",
    "these results represent a very important step towards the adoption of sipms as the baseline for future liquid argon dark matter detectors .",
