    "sequences of neutron and proton capture , interspersed with @xmath3 decays , play an important role in astrophysics . the slow- and rapid neutron capture processes ( s- and r - process ) are responsible for the synthesis of most of the elements beyond the iron group @xcite .",
    "slower proton captures generate much of the energy in nova explosions and massive stars , while the rapid proton capture process ( rp - process ) powers type i x - ray bursts @xcite and might also occur in a proton rich neutrino driven wind in core collapse supernovae @xcite .",
    "the nature of such capture processes depends on the temperature and density conditions encountered in the stellar environment . at relatively low temperatures and densities",
    "capture reactions are typically much slower than @xmath3 decays .",
    "captures can then only occur on stable or very long lived isotopes and the reaction paths proceed along the valley of stability . at somewhat higher temperatures and densities encountered mainly in explosive scenarios capture rates can become faster than @xmath3-decay rates and the sequence of reactions responsible for nucleosynthesis and energy generation moves towards unstable nuclei . at the most extreme conditions ,",
    "nucleosynthesis paths are governed by partial ( qse , quasi nuclear statistical equilibrium ) or full nuclear statistical equilibrium ( nse ) as both , particle capture rates and the rates of their inverse photodisintegration processes triggered by high energy photons are fast .",
    "the nuclei favored in full nse depend on the conditions , in particular electron fraction and entropy , but typically nucleosynthesis paths tend to shift to nuclei closer to stability , or , at the extreme involve only protons , neutrons , and alpha particles .",
    "the temperatures and densities during the astrophysical rapid neutron capture process ( r - process ) and rapid proton capture processes ( rp - process ) are just short of establishing nse .",
    "these processes therefore proceed along some of the most exotic nuclei encountered in astrophysics . nevertheless , at these extreme conditions some local equilibrium clusters do form - in the rp - process along isotonic chains as ( @xmath4)-(@xmath5 ) equilibrium , and in the r - process along isotopic chains as ( @xmath6)-(@xmath7 ) equilibrium .",
    "these equilibrium clusters tend to prevent the reaction paths from reaching or crossing the respective drip lines and determine the so called `` waiting point '' nucleus - the nucleus with the highest abundance in an equilibrium chain .",
    "once equilibrium is established , the process has to wait for the waiting point nucleus to @xmath3 decay in order to proceed towards heavier nuclei .    in an isotonic or isotopic equilibrium",
    "the abundance ratio of two neighboring nuclei indexed by @xmath8 and @xmath9 with increasing @xmath10 or @xmath11 is simply given by the saha equation :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the abundances of an initial and final nucleus of a single proton or neutron capture reaction in the chain , @xmath15 is the temperature , @xmath16 the proton or neutron density , @xmath17 the partition function , @xmath18 the mass number , @xmath19 the atomic mass unit , @xmath20 the boltzmann constant , and @xmath21 the proton or neutron separation energy , respectively .",
    "the maximum abundance in a chain and therefore the path of the process for a given density and temperature occurs at a fixed separation energy . because of the exponential dependence on binding energy differences ( @xmath22 in eq .",
    "[ eqsaha ] ) nuclear masses are among the most important quantities for modeling the r- and rp - processes .    to which degree are equilibria along isotopic or isotonic chains realized in the r- or rp - process ?",
    "most but not all current r - process models , including models based on the neutron rich neutrino driven wind in core collapse supernovae , are based on a freezeout from some high temperature nse or qse state and therefore include an extended phase of more extended ( @xmath6)-(@xmath7 ) equilibrium along isotopic chains .",
    "before the fundamental problem of the site of the r - process is solved , it can not be decided with certainty what the relevant nuclear processes are but to move the field forward it is critical to address the nuclear physics issues of the most promising models .",
    "the situation for the rp - process in neutrino driven winds is similar with the system passing through a phase of ( @xmath4)-(@xmath5 ) equilibrium prior to freezeout . on the other hand ,",
    "the rp - process in x - ray bursts is characterized by a rapid heating phase ( 1 - 10 s ) up to peak temperatures around 1.5 - 2  gk followed by a slower cooling phase ( 10 - 100 s ) and freezeout . in x - ray bursts , extended ( @xmath4)-(@xmath5 ) equilibrium in most isotonic chains is only established for the relatively short period during the peak of the burst when temperatures exceed about 1.2 - 1.3  gk . even then , because of the relatively steep slope of the proton separation energy towards the proton drip line , there are still many important reactions where proton separation energies are too high and ( @xmath5 ) reactions are too slow to establish equilibrium .",
    "for example , for @xmath23 the main rp - process flow proceeds via @xmath0ge(p,@xmath24)@xmath25as(p,@xmath24)@xmath26se with leakages through @xmath3-decays .",
    "the proton separation energy of @xmath25as is low ( -0.36 mev , see below ) and therefore @xmath25as(@xmath24,p ) is fast , establishing ( @xmath4)-(@xmath5 ) equilibrium during the entire phase of reaction flow during this region . on the other hand",
    "the proton separation energy of @xmath26se is 2.4 mev ( see below ) .",
    "as we will show below , temperatures of more than 1.5  gk are required for @xmath26se(@xmath24,p ) to establish a full ( @xmath4)-(@xmath5 ) equilibrium between @xmath25as and @xmath26se .",
    "therefore , the rp - process in x - ray bursts proceeds through phases of partial ( @xmath4)-(@xmath5 ) equilibrium , mostly between pairs of isotones near the proton drip line , and , depending on the peak temperatures reached in the particular x - ray burst model , a brief phase of complete ( @xmath4)-(@xmath5 ) equilibrium at the highest temperatures .",
    "therefore , the rp - process in x - ray bursts is a rather complex process .",
    "the extent of equilibria is rapidly changing within seconds during the burst rise and within 10 - 100  s during the burst cooling .",
    "the reaction flows can not be described simply with eq .",
    "[ eqsaha ] and , as we will show below , proton capture rates play an important role during much of the rp - process .",
    "in addition , up to about @xmath27 ( depending on the peak temperatures attained in a particular x - ray burst ) ( @xmath28,p ) reactions can compete with proton capture chains and the respective branchings depend also on reaction rates .",
    "nevertheless , masses are a critical part of the nuclear physics determining observables of x - ray bursts .",
    "the sensitivity of r - process calculations to nuclear masses has been discussed extensively in the past ( for example @xcite ) .",
    "the rp - process in neutrino driven winds is a rather new concept with the added complication of an interplay with neutron induced reactions as neutrino interactions do create a sizeable neutron density @xcite .",
    "pruet et al .",
    "2005 @xcite point out that mass uncertainties directly affect the final abundances and that improved masses for neutron deficient isotopes , for example around @xmath29ru , would be important to address the question of the contribution of this scenario to galactic nucleosynthesis .",
    "more work needs to be done to investigate in detail the nuclear physics sensitivities . in this paper",
    "we therefore concentrate on the role of masses in the rp - process in x - ray bursts .",
    "in contrast to the r - process , a significant number of masses along the rp - process have been detemined experimentally .",
    "reviews of the relevant nuclear physics can be found in @xcite . as all but a few rp - process nuclei",
    "have been observed in experiments , the proton drip line is roughly delineated by experimental constraints on the lifetime of nuclei .",
    "in addition , unknown masses can be predicted more reliably as one only needs to extrapolate a few mass units in most cases .",
    "this can be done using the extrapolation method of audi and wapstra @xcite . as the rp - process proceeds mostly beyond the @xmath30 line one can also take advantage of isospin symmetry and calculate the masses of the most exotic rp - process nuclei from the better known masses of their mirrors .",
    "brown et al .",
    "@xcite have recently shown that mass shifts between isospin mirror nuclei can be calculated with an accuracy of 100  kev using a skyrme hartree - fock model .",
    "however , this still requires accurate knowledge of the masses of the mirror nuclei that lie closer to stability . despite of this progress ,",
    "the typical theoretical mass uncertainties of many hundreds of kev are still not acceptable to reliably model x - ray bursts and to compare calculations with observations in a quantitative way .",
    "mass measurements ( together with reaction rate measurements ) are therefore essential for a better understanding of the rp - process .    in section [ rp - process ]",
    "we begin by summarizing the astrophysical observables that drive the demand for improved nuclear physics in the rp - process . after discussing the importance of mass measurements for reaction rate calculations , we then focus in section [ waitingpoints ] on a series of recent precision mass measurements performed using ion traps .",
    "we explore the potential impact on rp - process calculations and the interplay of masses and reaction rates .",
    "in particular we show that even though tremendous progress has been made through recent experimental work , the question of the rp - process timescale for passing through the region of the major bottle - necks @xmath0ge , @xmath1se , and @xmath2kr is still not resolved .",
    "the rapid proton capture process powers type i x - ray bursts , which occur when a neutron star accretes hydrogen rich matter from a companion star in a binary system .",
    "see @xcite for reviews of the astrophysical aspects and @xcite for a recent review of the nuclear physics aspects .",
    "the observed burst light curves are sensitive to the underlying nuclear physics @xcite .",
    "nuclear physics is therefore needed to allow one to interpret burst observations in terms of system parameters such as the properties of the neutron star or the composition of the accreted matter .",
    "in addition , most of the nuclear burning ashes from x - ray bursts remains on the surface of the neutron star and gets incorporated into the crust by the ongoing accretion .",
    "the nuclear physics of x - ray bursts is therefore needed to accurately calculate the composition of the burst ashes and therefore the composition of the neutron star crust .",
    "a wide range of observable crust phenomena such as the rare superbursts @xcite or the surface cooling behavior of the neutron star depend critically on composition @xcite .",
    "this is particularly important as these phenomena could be used to constrain the properties of the neutron star if understood in a quantitative way .",
    "finally , it has been shown recently that there is the possibility for some types of bursts to eject small but potentially observable amounts of burst ashes @xcite .",
    "nuclear physics is needed to accurately predict the observables and to match possible future observations with x - ray burst models .",
    "precision mass measurements are important for rp - process calculations for two reasons .",
    "first , as explained above , ( @xmath4)-(@xmath5 ) equilibrium clusters form during the rp - process with the reaction flow largely determined by mass differences , i.e. proton separation energies .",
    "the mass sensitivity comes mainly from the @xmath31 term in eq .",
    "[ eqsaha ] .",
    "the second reason is the importance of accurate nuclear masses in the calculation of reaction rates , for example for proton capture .",
    "most of the relevant nuclear reactions proceed through resonances , and the corresponding rate can be expressed as a sum over all resonances through @xcite    @xmath32    with the resonance energy in the center of mass system @xmath33 , the temperature in gk @xmath34 and the reduced mass of the entrance channel @xmath35 in amu .",
    "the resonance strengths @xmath36 are in mev and can be calculated for proton capture as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the target spin , and @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 are spin , proton decay width , @xmath24-decay width , and total width of the compound nucleus state @xmath43 .    near the proton drip line level densities",
    "tend to be low limiting the applicability of more reliable statistical model calculations .",
    "direct reaction rate measurements using low energy radioactive beams are extremely difficult due to limited beam intensities at existing radioactive beam facilities , and therefore eq .  [ eqres ] is often the only way to determine a reaction rate . the various ingredients , such as particle and radiative widths for the levels involved can be obtained from experiments or from shell model calculations @xcite . however , as eq .",
    "[ eqres ] shows , the reaction rate depends exponentially on the resonance energy , which is obtained from the excitation energy @xmath44 of the resonant state using the reaction q - value @xmath45 from @xmath46 .",
    "in addition , the proton width @xmath47 in eq .  [ eqog ] includes the penetrability of the proton through the coulomb barrier and depends therefore also exponentially on the resonance energy . reaction rates calculated with eq .  [ eqres ]",
    "are therefore extremely sensitive to nuclear masses and excitation energies .",
    "typically , resonance energies need to be known to better than 10  kev to keep the corresponding reaction rate uncertainty below about a factor of 2 .",
    "this is far beyond the accuracy achievable with mass extrapolations for the q - values , and shell model calculations for the excitation energies .",
    "the latter typically reach 100  kev accuracy in the rather well constrained sd - shell when the levels in mirror nuclei are accurately known @xcite .",
    "recently techniques have been developed to measure excitation energies of low lying states in very neutron deficient nuclei using radioactive beams .",
    "an example is the use of ( p , d ) transfer reactions in inverse kinematics using fast radioactive beams at the nscl at michigan state university @xcite . in a first experiment excitation energies in @xmath48ar needed for the calculation of the @xmath49cl(p,@xmath24)@xmath48ar reaction rates",
    "could be determined with accuracies of better than 10  kev .",
    "in addition , the mass of @xmath48ar had been determined independently at isoltrap @xcite with an accuracy of 0.44  kev . combining the mass and excitation energy measurements and using shell model calculations for all other level properties",
    "the reaction rate uncertainty could be reduced from a factor of about 10000 to a factor of 3 - 6 @xcite .",
    "excitation energy measurements with fast radioactive beams are now possible for much of the rp - process up to about a@xmath5068 . however , these measurements need to be complemented with accurate measurements of ground state masses of better than 10  kev ( 1  kev accuracy is desirable ) to be useful . as fig .",
    "[ figmass ] shows masses are currently not known with sufficient accuracy for most of the rp - process path , even when experimental data are available .",
    "further precision measurements of ground state masses using ion trap measurements together with measurements of excitation energies along the path of the rp - process are therefore needed .",
    "a particularly important part of the rp - process is the reaction flow through the region of the three major waiting points @xmath0ge , @xmath1se , and @xmath2kr @xcite with @xmath3-decay half - lives @xmath52 of 63.7  s , 35.5  s , and 17.16  s @xcite , respectively .",
    "because these isotopes are located at the proton drip line , proton capture is hampered by ( @xmath24,p ) reactions on the next , most likely proton unbound isotone .",
    "if the rp - process had to proceed via the @xmath3-decay of these waiting points , their combined @xmath3-decay lifetime @xmath53 of 168  s would represent a large impedance for the rp - process that would be comparable to typical burst timescales of 10 - 100  s. this would significantly slow down the rate of hydrogen burning and lead to extended burst tails .",
    "x - ray burst model calculations are therefore particularly sensitive to the question to which degree weak proton capture flows can reduce these lifetimes .",
    "this issue is at the heart of the question whether long burst timescales can be used as a signature of the rp - process and if one can use burst timescales to put quantitative constraints on the amount of hydrogen accreted .",
    "as discussed and demonstrated in several studies , x - ray burst lightcurves are directly sensitive to the effective lifetimes of the waiting points @xmath0ge , @xmath1se , and @xmath2kr @xcite .    the nuclear physics determining the effective rp - process lifetime of major waiting points has been discussed extensively in schatz et al .",
    "@xcite . in",
    "the following we discuss in detail the situation at the @xmath0ge waiting point .",
    "analogeous processes occur at @xmath1se and @xmath2kr . the proton capture flow on @xmath0ge proceeds via a so called 2p - capture reaction .",
    "current mass predictions ( see below ) predict @xmath25as to be slightly unbound with a proton separation energy of -0.36 mev .",
    "the coulomb - barrier is sufficient to suppress spontaneous proton decay so that @xmath25as decays under terrestrial conditions by @xmath3-decay in agreement with experimental evidence @xcite .",
    "the low proton separation energy leads to an establishment of a ( @xmath4)-(@xmath5 ) equilibrium between @xmath0ge and @xmath25as at all times when there is reaction flow in this mass region . also , because of the low proton separation energy the equilibrium abundance of @xmath25as is very low .",
    "nevertheless , proton capture on @xmath25as can lead to a significant 2p - capture flow that can reduce the lifetime of @xmath0ge during an x - ray burst . at x - ray burst peak conditions",
    "@xmath0ge , @xmath25as , and @xmath26se are in ( @xmath4)-(@xmath5 ) equilibrium",
    ". the net 2p - capture flow through this isotonic chain and therefore the effective lifetime of @xmath0ge is then determined by the leakage out of the equilibrium via the @xmath3 decay of @xmath26se",
    ". the most critical quantities to determine the 2p capture rate and the effective lifetime of @xmath0ge for a given temperature and proton density are therefore the @xmath3-decay half - lives of @xmath0ge and @xmath26se , the proton separation energies of @xmath25as and @xmath26se , and the proton capture rate on @xmath25as .",
    "accordingly , the @xmath3-decay half - lives of @xmath1se , @xmath54kr , @xmath2kr , @xmath55sr , the proton separation energies of @xmath56br , @xmath54kr , @xmath57rb , @xmath55sr , and the proton capture rates on @xmath56br and @xmath57rb are of importance for the waiting points at @xmath1se and @xmath2kr respectively .",
    "while the @xmath3-decay half - lives of the important nuclei around these major waiting points have been known in most cases for some time @xcite , it has recently become possible to also perform precision mass measurements using ion traps in this mass region .",
    "of particular importance are recent mass measurements of @xmath0ge and @xmath1se using the canadian penning trap at anl @xcite ( the mass of @xmath1se had also been determined independently using the @xmath3-endpoint technique @xcite ) and the mass measurements of @xmath58kr at isoltrap @xcite . in addition , skyrme hartree - fock calculations allow now the calculation of coulomb mass shifts between mirror nuclei with an estimated accuracy of 100  kev @xcite . while mass measurements on @xmath25as , @xmath26se , @xmath56br , @xmath54kr , @xmath57rb , and @xmath55sr have not been feasible so far , their isospin mirrors are within reach for ion trap mass measurements .",

    "@xmath3-decay of @xmath56kr or proton removal reactions are possibilities and might be feasible at existing radioactive beam facilities . in parallel , improved theoretical estimates of the proton capture rates on @xmath25as and @xmath56br would be helpful , as these could reduce , or increase , the sensitivities to nuclear masses ( see fig .  [ figge ] ) .",
    "masses play a critical role in the r- and rp - processes . for the rp - process in x - ray bursts , masses in the vicinity of the major waiting points @xmath0ge , @xmath1se , and @xmath2kr are particularly important .",
    "while mass uncertainties have been reduced significantly through experimental and theoretical progress , they are still too large to reliably determine the effective lifetimes of these waiting points in the rp - process",
    ". mass related lifetime uncertainties for @xmath0ge , @xmath1se , and @xmath2kr still amount to up to factors of 60 , 4 , and 1.7 respectively with the combined effective lifetime of all three waiting points at 1.4  gk ranging from 29  s to 108  s. in general , mass accuracies of the order of 10  kev are needed to sufficiently constrain 2p - capture flows . while some of the relevant measurements should be feasible at existing facilities , others will require considerable advances .    as we have also shown , all lifetimes are sensitive to the proton capture rates on @xmath25as , @xmath56br , and @xmath57rb . without reliable estimates for these reaction rates (",
    "upper limits would already be helpful ) the question to which degree the rp - process reaction flow is impeded by the waiting points @xmath0ge , @xmath1se , and @xmath2kr can not be answered reliably .",
    "for example , within all the uncertainties the effective lifetime of @xmath0ge can still range from 10  ms to the full @xmath3-decay lifetime of 92  s. in the former case , @xmath0ge would not delay the rp - process at all , while in the latter case it would be the singly most important waiting point imposing a delay of the order of the burst timescale .",
    "direct measurements of these reaction rates are difficult , or , in the case of the proton captures on @xmath57rb or @xmath56br , impossible due to the sub microsecond lifetime of the target nuclei . however , decay and transfer reactions clarifying the structure of the final nuclei , or coulomb breakup , might be possibilities in the future . until then ,",
    "a better theoretical description and further experimental clarification of the structure of the mirror nuclei would be helpful .",
