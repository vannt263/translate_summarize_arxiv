    "the study of fractal phenomena was introduced to high energy particle and nuclear physics by bialas and peschanski in ref .",
    "@xcite , see also ref.@xcite for a review . in qcd , jets emit jets that emit additional jets and so on . the resulting fractal structure of qcd jets was explored with the help of a beautiful geometric picture in refs .",
    "these ideas were developed further by the lund group in refs .",
    "@xcite , by dokshitzer and dremin in ref .",
    "@xcite as well as by ochs and woisek in refs .  @xcite .",
    "both theoretical and experimental aspects of the so - called intermittency or fractal structures in high energy physics were reviewed by de  wolf , dremin and kittel in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "bialas realized , that bose - einstein correlations and intermittency might be deeply connected  @xcite .",
    "the mathematical properties of bose - einstein correlation functions for lvy stable ( convolution invariant ) sources were written up by three of us in refs .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we add a physical interpretation and show , that the fractal properties of qcd cascades can naturally be measured by the lvy index of stability of bose - einstein correlations .",
    "our analytical results are similar in spirit to the numerical investigations of wilk and collaborators in ref .  @xcite .",
    "in this section we recapitulate earlier theoretical results of the lund group ,   @xcite , that related the properties of qcd cascades to intermittency .",
    "these results are based on a beautiful geometric interpretation of the color dipole picture , and on an infrared stable measure on parton states related to hadronic multiplicity .",
    "the phase - space of qcd jets in the @xmath0 plane , where @xmath1 .",
    "( a ) the phase - space available for a gluon emitted by a high energy @xmath2 system is a triangular region in the @xmath0 plane .",
    "( b ) if one gluon is emitted at @xmath3 , the phase - space for a second ( softer ) gluon is given by the area of this folded surface .",
    "( c ) the total gluonic phase - space can be described by this multifaceted fractal surface  @xcite . ]",
    "a high energy @xmath2 system radiates gluons according to the dipole formula @xmath4 hence the phase - space for the emission of a gluon is given by the relation @xmath5 which corresponds to the triangular region in a @xmath6 diagram as shown in fig .",
    "if two gluons are emitted , then the distribution of the hardest gluon is described by eq .",
    "the distribution of the second , softer , gluon corresponds to two dipoles , the first is stretched between the quark and the first gluon , and the second between the first gluon and the anti - quark .",
    "the phase - space available for the second gluon corresponds to the folded surface in fig . 1 ( b )",
    ", with the constraint @xmath7 , as the first gluon is assumed to be the hardest one .",
    "this procedure can be generalized so that the emission of a third , still softer gluon corresponds to radiation from three color dipoles , with @xmath8 gluons emitted already the emission of the @xmath9-th gluon is given by a chain of @xmath10 dipoles .",
    "thus , with many gluons , the gluonic phase - space can be represented by a multi - faceted surface as illustrated in fig . 1 ( c ) .",
    "each gluon adds a fold to the surface , which increases the phase - space for softer gluons .",
    "( note , that in this process the recoils are neglected , as is normal in leading log approximation ) . due to its iterative nature",
    ", the process generates a koch - type fractal curve at the base - line .",
    "the length of this base - line of the partonic structure on figure 1.c is proportional to the particle multiplicity .",
    "this curve is longer , when studied with higher resolution : it is a fractal curve , embedded into the four - dimensional energy - momentum space , characterized by the fractal dimension d_f = 1 + , or one plus the anomalous dimension of qcd  @xcite .    with the help of the lund string fragmentation picture , this fractal in momentum space",
    "is mapped into a fractal in coordinate space , and the constant of conversion is the hadronic string tension , @xmath11 gev / fm .",
    "this mapping does not change the fractal properties of the curve .",
    "the emission of softer and softer gluons corresponds to a smaller and smaller modification of this curve , as a gluon with a very small transverse mass creates a very small kink on the lund string .",
    "hence this process is infrared stable .",
    "let us discuss here the stability of the particle emitting source in qcd , and consider the bose - einstein correlation functions for such sources .",
    "the two - particle bose - einstein correlation function is defined as the ratio of the two - particle invariant momentum distribution to the product of the single - particle invariant momentum distributions : @xmath12 if long - range correlations can be neglected or corrected for , and if the short - range correlations are dominated by bose - einstein correlations , this two - particle bose - einstein correlation function is related to the fourier - transformed source distribution . for clarity ,",
    "let us consider the case of a one - dimensional , factorized coordinate and momentum space distribution , @xmath13 in this case  @xcite , the bose - einstein correlation function is @xmath14 where the fourier transformed source density ( often referred to as the _ characteristic function _ ) and the relative momentum are defined as @xmath15    let us focus on the property of particle emission from qcd jets , that the fractal defining the particle emission is infrared stable : adding one more , very soft gluon does not change the resulting source distributions .",
    "thus the source of particles is stable for convolution .",
    "the bose - einstein correlation functions for such particle emitting sources were evaluated recently by three of us , which we summarize in this section following refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite .    for the case of the jets decaying to jets to jets and so on , the final position of a particle emission",
    "is given by a large number of position shifts , hence the distribution of the final position @xmath16 is obtained as a convolution , x = _",
    "i=1^n x_i , f(x ) = _",
    "i=1^n x_i _",
    "j=1^n f_j(x_j ) ( x - _",
    "k=1^n x_k ) .",
    "various forms of the central limit theorem state , that under certain conditions , the distribution of the sum of a large number of random variables converges ( for @xmath17 ) to a limit distribution . in case of  normal \" elementary processes , that have finite means and variances ,",
    "the limit distribution of their sum is a gaussian .",
    "stable distributions are precisely those limit distributions that can occur in generalized central limit theorems .",
    "their study was begun by the french mathematician paul lvy in the 1920 s .",
    "the stable distributions are frequently given in terms of their characteristic functions , as the fourier transform of a convolution is a product of the fourier - transforms , f(q ) = _",
    "i=1^n f_i(q ) and limit distributions appear when the convolution of one more elementary process does not change the form of the limit distribution , but it results only in a modification of its location and scale parameters .",
    "the characteristic function of univariate and symmetric stable distributions is f(q)= ( i q -|q|^ ) , [ e : fqs ] where the support of the density function @xmath18 is @xmath19 .",
    "deep mathematical results imply that the index of stability , @xmath20 , satisfies the inequality @xmath21 , so that the source distribution be always positive .",
    "these lvy distributions are indeed stable for convolutions , in the following sense : f_i(q ) & = & ( i q _ i -|_i q|^ ) , _",
    "i=1^n f_i(q ) = ( i q -|q|^ ) , + ^ & = & _ i=1^n _ i^ , = _ i=1^n _ i. [ e : gami ]    thus the bose - einstein correlation functions for univariate , symmetric stable distributions ( after a core - halo correction , and a re - scaling ) read as @xmath22 for the special value of @xmath23 we obtain the well known gaussian case . refs .",

    ". figure  [ fig:1dlevy - lin ] ( b ) illustrates , that values of the index of stability @xmath20 are related to the tails of these distributions . if @xmath26 , for large values of @xmath31 the lvy sources decay as @xmath32 .",
    "figure  [ fig:1dlevy - lin ] ( c ) shows a two - dimensional symmetric lvy stable source .",
    "bose - einstein correlation functions for lvy stable source distributions are shown in figure  [ fig:1dlevy - lin ] ( d ) for various values of the index of stability @xmath20 , and for a constant value of the radius parameter @xmath33 .",
    "these bose - einstein correlation functions are sensitive to the value of @xmath20 not only in the small @xmath34 region , but are also in the  large \" relative momentum region of @xmath35 .",
    "thus these correlations are sensitive to the structure of the particle emission in the region which is shaped by the jets .",
    "a random walk , where the length of the steps is given by a lvy distribution , and the direction of the steps is random , corresponds to a fractal curve , in physical terms it can be interpreted as the path of a test particle performing a generalized brownian motion .",
    "this motion is referred to as anomalous diffusion and the probability that the test particle diffuses to distances @xmath36 greater than a certain value of @xmath37 is given by @xmath38 .",
    "this relation is valid for anomalous diffusion not only in one , but also in two and three dimensions .",
    "thus the lvy index of stability @xmath20 is the fractal dimension of the trajectory of the corresponding anomalous diffusion  @xcite . when we apply this result to qcd , there are two key considerations .",
    "first , if gluon radiation is neglected , the @xmath2 system hadronizes as a 1 + 1 dimensional hadronic string , which has no fractal structure .",
    "if the gluon emission is switched on , the emission of gluon @xmath8 from one of the @xmath8 dipoles corresponds to a step of an anomalous diffusion in the plane transverse to the given dipole .",
    "hence the anomalous dimension of qcd equals to the lvy index of stability of this anomalous diffusion , = _ .",
    "second , data on bose - einstein correlations are often determined in terms of the invariant momentum difference @xmath39 .",
    "bose - einstein correlation functions that depend on this invariant momentum difference can be obtained within the framework of the so - called @xmath40-model .",
    "this model assumes a broad proper - time distribution , @xmath41 and very strong correlations between coordinate and momentum in all directions , @xmath42 .",
    "hence @xmath43 , see refs .",
    "@xcite for details . in this case , the bose - einstein correlation function measures the fourier - transformed proper - time distribution @xmath44 in the following , unusual manner : c_2(q_inv ) 1 + h^2 ( ) , where @xmath45 stands for the ( transverse ) mass of the pair for ( two)- or more jet events . from this relation",
    "it follows , that @xmath46 .",
    "thus we find the following relationship between the strong coupling constant and the exponent of an invariant relative momentum dependent bose - einstein correlation function : _ s = ^2_.[e : qcda ]",
    "in ref .  @xcite three of us have fitted the na22  @xcite and the ua1 data  @xcite on two - particle bose - einstein correlation functions with the lvy stable form of eq .",
    "( [ e : bec - levy ] ) .",
    "the results were summarized in table 1 of that paper .",
    "here we re - interpret the exponent of this fit with the help of eq .",
    "( [ e : qcda ] ) and extract @xmath47 , the coupling constant of qcd , as given by table 1 of this paper .    .",
    "converting the best lvy fits to ua1 and na22 two - particle correlations using the @xmath40-model converted with eq.([e : qcda ] ) to values for the running qcd coupling constant @xmath47 . [ cols= \" < , > , < , > , < \" , ]",
    "using the picture of strongly correlated coordinate and momentum space distributions , we determined the ( running of the ) strong coupling constant from na22 and ua1 two - pion bose - einstein correlation measurements .",
