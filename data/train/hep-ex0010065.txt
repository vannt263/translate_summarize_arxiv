    "the large active detector volume , the necessary expandability to perform different physics experiments and the upgradeability during the longevity of the experiment requires a scalable and distributed readout system with federal event building ( figure  [ fig : architecture ] ) .",
    "the high particle flux from the traversing beam at intensities of @xmath0particles per spill ( 2.4  s ) requires dead - timeless readout with digitisation immediately at the detector .",
    "data are stored on the front - end boards in random access memories or pipelines for about 2  @xmath1s until trigger decisions have been taken .",
    "only those hits are transmitted to the master event - builder which are time correlated to a physics trigger event .",
    "hence background data are suppressed at an early stage of the readout chain , which reduces the necessary bandwidth significantly down to several gigabytes per spill .",
    "the trigger rate depends on the physics reactions to be studied and is in the range of 10100  khz .",
    "trigger signals are distributed synchronously to a 38.88  mhz clock via optical fibres from the trigger control system ( tcs ) laser crate .",
    "additional event information like spill and event numbers , time synchronisation signal and begin- and end - of - spill flags are transmitted through the same fibre by time multiplexing .",
    "the readout driver named catch ( compass accumulate , transfer and control hardware  @xcite ) serves as a common interface between the detector - specific front - end boards , the trigger control system and the readout buffers .",
    "data which belong to one event are combined in a local sub - event building process and consistency checks are performed on the data integrity .",
    "the sub - events are transmitted via a fast optical link to readout buffers , which can store all data from at least one spill .",
    "sub - events are combined and transmitted via gigabit ethernet to filter computers . here",
    "the final event - building is performed , events are partly reconstructed and , based on physics cuts , data may be reduced by a factor of 5 to 10 .",
    "finally a continuous rate of 30  mbyte / s of event data can be transfered to the central data recording facilities at cern , where the events will be stored in an objectivity / db data base .",
    "the total amount of data accumulated each year will be about 300  terabyte .",
    "to be in compliance with a dead - time free data - digitisation and the time resolution requirements of the detectors we developed a new tdc - chip .",
    "this device can be easily adapted to the conditions of different detector types  @xcite .",
    "the f1-tdc , produced in 0.6  @xmath1 m sea - of - gates technology , supports basically three modes : in the high rate option ( @xmath2  6  mhz input rate ) the tdc chip provides a digitisation width of 60  ps on four input channels at a double pulse resolution of about 18  ns . the standard mode delivers a digitisation unit of about 120  ps on eight inputs per chip at a dynamic range of 16 bits .",
    "the latch mode implements a 32  channel low resolution ( @xmath24.7  ns ) readout for multi wire proportional chambers . in all modes",
    "the hits , which are time correlated to the trigger . are selected for readout from an internal buffer .",
    "we have chosen two options for interfacing the f1-tdc to the catch readout driver : for the high rate detectors like scintillating fibres , trigger hodoscopes and the beam momentum stations , the tdcs are placed on mezzanine cards , which are mounted on the catch , allowing for a readout speed of 120  mbyte / s .",
    "each mezzanine card hosts four tdc chips and supports 32 differential inputs in standard resolution or 16  inputs in high resolution mode ( software selectable ) .",
    "the straw tubes , drift chambers and micromega chambers have the tdcs mounted on the front - end boards operated in standard resolution mode , as well as the multi wire proportional chambers with the f1-chip in latch mode . in case of the micromega chambers  @xcite both leading and trailing edges are read - out allowing for noise suppression and walk correction by measuring the time over threshold .",
    "for all front - end mounted f1-tdcs a dac interface is used to set the thresholds of the external discriminators . up to",
    "eight tdcs are placed on one front - end board and read - out through a common bus , which interfaces to a hotlink serialiser chip .",
    "four exchangeable input mezzanine cards mounted on the 9u vme module provide a highly flexible input interface ( figure  [ fig : catch ] ) . at the moment",
    "we have developed three different types of mezzanine cards following the ieee cmc standard :    one type receives digitised data from up to four different front - end boards . for this mezzanine card",
    "we use the hotlink serialising chip and a 600  mhz differential twisted pair line to achieve 400 mbaud sustained input data rate .",
    "the same patch cable is used to transmit trigger , time synchronisation and a power - up reset signal on a common line . through a third and fourth line the reference clock and initialisation data ,",
    "respectively , are distributed to the front - end boards .",
    "this card is also available with a fibre optical link to replace copper cables .",
    "another type of mezzanine card hosts four f1-tdc chips resulting in a 128 channel tdc module .",
    "a 32 channel 300 mhz dead - time free and trigger - latency correcting scaler is implemented on the third mezzanine card .",
    "while framed data are transmitted at a maximum throughput of 160  mbyte / s to the readout buffer via a s - link module  @xcite , an independent spy buffer can be used to access events via the vme bus at a lower data rate .",
    "this allows for an easy setup of a stand alone daq without s - link and spill buffer at test beams .",
    "the live insertion of the catch and plug  & play feature for front - end and mezzanine boards greatly enhances the maintainability of the system and eliminates miscabling .",
    "the front - end boards transmit their identification and position on the detector to the catch , which stores this information in the geometry database and receives the corresponding initialisation data from the calibration database .",
    "this work would be impossible without the formidable support of the local electronic workshop and engineer team .",
    "we deeply appreciate the many stimulating discussions with our colleagues from the compass collaboration involved in front - end electronics development .",
