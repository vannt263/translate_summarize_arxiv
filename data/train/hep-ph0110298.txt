    "the infinite tower of integral schwinger - dyson equations ( sdes ) links n - point green s functions ( @xmath0 ) of a quantum - field theory .",
    "their exact solution would provide complete information on the physics of the theory , including its non - perturbative regime . in practice",
    ", the system of sdes has to be truncated and closed by making assumptions about the driving term , which contains more complicated green s functions determined by equations that were thrown away .",
    "most often only the simplest equation for the 2-point green s function(s ) ( one particle propagator ) is retained , its kernel contains n - point ( @xmath1 ) vertex the full form of which is unknown .",
    "hence some physical ansatz has to be used and then the equations can be solved ( usually numerically ) .",
    "one hopes that the solution provides some useful information on the behavior of the theory , in particular in the non - perturbative region .",
    "it is certainly interesting to compare the solution with results of alternative non - perturbative techniques @xcite .    in most papers on the solution of the sde , the wick rotation from minkowski to euclidean space",
    "is employed in order to escape singularities of the kernel inherent to physical green functions . we instead attempt to find the solution directly in minkowski space by making use of the spectral representation of the green s functions based on their known ( or assumed ) analytical properties . in this contribution",
    "we will for simplicity illustrate this method of solution with a simple example of self - interacting scalar fields with super - renormalizable unphysical @xmath2 coupling .",
    "possibilities of extending the technique to more realistic theories are briefly discussed .",
    "our approach is a straightforward extension of the spectral decomposition method of kusaka _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , developed for the solution of the bethe - salpeter equation for scalar bound states .",
    "the green s functions  one scalar particle propagator in our case  are written as spectral integrals over some weight functions .",
    "then we put these parameterizations and an expression for the vertex function into the sde , combine denominators with the help of the usual feynman parameterization , integrate over the loop momentum / momenta and obtain the real integral equations for the weight functions depending on spectral variables . these equations",
    "are free of singularities and can be solved by iterations .",
    "the generic spectral decomposition of the dressed renormalized scalar propagator reads : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a positive spectral function . here , we assume that @xmath5 has a singular contribution due to the propagation of physical particle with the mass @xmath6 and a regular positive smooth part @xmath7 which starts at the two - particle threshold .",
    "this assumption means that the particle spectrum of the system is essentially perturbative , e.g. , there is no confinement and also the contribution of possible bound states below @xmath8 is neglected ( the latter appears as corrections to the vertex from the poles in the 4-point green s function ) .",
    "the form of the sde for an one particle propagator depends on the form of the interaction . for our toy model with @xmath9 and introducing the renormalized ( by on - mass shell subtraction ) self - energy @xmath10",
    "we get @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a bare mass , the residue of @xmath13 at the pole @xmath14 equals 1 ; @xmath15 is a combinatorial factor , @xmath16 is the renormalization function of the @xmath17 field , which is finite for the cubic interaction .",
    "the adopted renormalization procedure suggests the following spectral decomposition for @xmath10 : @xmath18 we will mostly work in the bare vertex approximation @xmath19 . from the imaginary part of @xmath20 and from the dispersion relations of eqs .",
    "( [ genspec ] ) and ( [ selfdis ] ) follows : @xmath21 from the sde ( [ sde ] ) we get the second relation between @xmath22 and @xmath23 : @xmath24 \\ , , \\label{rhopi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is a purely kinematical function which also determines the integration bounds .",
    "the set of equations ( [ sderho],[rhopi ] ) is solved by iterations .",
    "the method works in essentially the same way also for more complicated theories .",
    "of course , if there is more than one type of particles , one gets a set of coupled integral equations . in more complicated theories",
    "it might not be always possible to integrate out all feynman parameters . then kinematical functions analogous to @xmath25 in eq .",
    "( [ rhopi ] ) are expressed in terms of the remaining integrations .",
    "that might slow down and complicate the solution , in particular one has to determine numerically the bounds for integrals over the spectral parameters @xmath26 .",
    "the iterations work very well for small @xmath27 , but in that region the propagator is not far from the free one . with increasing @xmath28 the rate of convergence is slowing down rather fast , then for a certain value @xmath29 it breaks down .",
    "we do not know at this stage the meaning of this critical value of the coupling constant , neither for our unphysical example of the scalar cubic interaction nor for other theories ( e.g.  @xmath30 ) .",
    "we even do not know whether the sde indeed does not have a ( formal ) solution for larger @xmath28 or whether it is just a failure of our numerical method .",
    "we would only observe that a very similar behavior was found in @xcite , where a similar coupling @xmath31 was considered . in our case",
    "it is also possible ( in a slightly modified formulation ) to calculate the field renormalization function @xmath16 which is finite .",
    "it appears that very close to @xmath32 ( within 5 per cent ) this function goes through zero ( another sign of pathological behavior ) .",
    "we are aware of the fact that the @xmath33 model is in fact not defined at all @xcite , hence its study should be viewed as purely methodological and one has to be very cautious in making any generalization",
    ". it might be nevertheless interesting that when one includes one loop corrections to the vertex function , @xmath32 drops by a factor of about 2 .",
    "figure 1 shows the weight functions @xmath7 from below for @xmath34 .",
    "the last line already shows wiggles , precursors of the numerical breakdown .",
    "figure 2 displays the self - energies below threshold @xmath35 from above for @xmath36 , compared with those obtained by dyson ( bubble ) summations ( for the last value @xmath37 we do not get a solution of the dse ) . for small @xmath28 s",
    "the dyson summation approximates our full solutions rather well , for @xmath28 close to @xmath32 they deviate by up to 25 per cent .",
    "we have developed and tested in a cubic scalar toy model the method of solving dse s in minkowski space .",
    "several applications of the method are in progress : studies of the scalar @xmath30 theory , of 3 + 1 qed in a quenched rainbow approximation , and of a theory with @xmath38 fermion - pseudoscalar coupling .",
    "the solution of sdes in the described framework seems to be feasible for all of these models , even with more complicated structure of equations employed .",
    "when one tries to include more loops , much more painful algebraic manipulations has to be done to bring equations for weight functions into manageable form .",
    "we hope to prove by this further tests that this method is competitive , compared to solutions in euclidean space .",
