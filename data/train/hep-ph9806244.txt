    "because of its very large mass , the top quark is an interesting object for precise studies and searches for possible `` new physics . '' in consequence of the large @xmath8 , top lifetime is very short . with good accuracy",
    "the top decay rate @xmath3 is proportional to the third power of the top mass and equals approximately @xmath9 gev for @xmath10 gev .",
    "this large width makes the top quark behave almost like a _ free _ quark , a unique situation in qcd @xcite .",
    "the reason for this is that the time scale @xmath11 of the weak top quark decay @xmath12^{-1},\\ ] ] is much shorter than the time scale of the non - perturbative qcd effects , @xmath13 .    within the standard model ( sm )",
    "the reaction @xmath14 is the dominant top quark decay channel .",
    "however , in most extensions of the standard model ( sm ) there are additional decay channels ( e.g.  @xmath15 or decays into final states including supersymmetric particles ) .",
    "since the sm prediction for the top quark lifetime can be given with high precision , its measurements can in principle shed light on the new physics contributions to top decay .",
    "the fact that the life time of the top quark is so small has rather interesting consequences for the top production in @xmath16 annihilation . because the nonperturbative effects are suppressed by the large @xmath3 , threshold production cross section of @xmath17 in @xmath18 collisions",
    "can be predicted rather reliably .",
    "clean signature and a rich physics potential @xcite make the investigation of this process in the threshold region one of the priorities at the next linear collider ( nlc ) .",
    "many studies have recently been performed in order to describe this reaction with high precision ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the total cross section for @xmath19 in the threshold region is determined by the equation : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the center of mass energy squared , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the value at the origin of the schrdinger equation green function describing the non  relativistic @xmath17 system . because of the @xmath24 dependence on @xmath3 , a precise prediction for the cross section requires a matching accuracy in @xmath3 .",
    "this is true not only for the total cross section but also for other top threshold observables , for example top momentum distribution .",
    "the analysis of @xmath24 has been recently extended to the next - to - next - to - leading order accuracy @xcite .",
    "that analysis was made possible in part by the recently calculated two - loop corrections to the qcd potential @xcite , whose influence on the threshold cross section was investigated in @xcite . on the other hand , the @xmath25 corrections to the width",
    "were not known at that time and were not included into those studies .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to provide @xmath3 including @xmath0 effects .",
    "the direct measurement of the top quark decay width at nlc is difficult . at the moment",
    "a determination of the top quark width based on the measurement of the forward - backward asymmetry of @xmath26 quarks in the threshold region in @xmath27 collisions is considered to be the most promising option .",
    "it is believed that the accuracy of @xmath28 can be obtained in such a measurement @xcite .",
    "more optimistic estimates of 5% accuracy have also been published @xcite .",
    "still better accuracy might be obtained at a future muon collider .",
    "because of the importance of the top quark width , much effort has been invested into studies of radiative corrections to its decays .",
    "here we briefly summarize the results obtained in the sm .",
    "for a more extensive discussion and a summary of calculations in some extensions of the sm we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite , where also corrections to various differential decay distributions are presented .",
    "qcd corrections to heavy quark decays were first studied in an effective fermi - like theory , valid for quarks much lighter than the @xmath29 @xcite . for the semileptonic",
    "decays such calculations were technically similar to the muon decay case @xcite .",
    "after it had become clear that the top quark is heavy , qcd corrections were calculated in @xcite with full @xmath29 propagator taken into account .",
    "these results are also applicable to the process @xmath30 which is now considered the dominant decay channel of the top quark , and in this context were confirmed in @xcite .",
    "the one - loop qcd corrections decrease the rate of this decay by about @xmath31 ( for @xmath32 gev ) .    at the @xmath0 level only the so - called blm @xcite corrections",
    "have been known @xcite .",
    "their numerical value will be illustrated below .",
    "summation of these effects to all orders has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "the electroweak corrections to @xmath30 were evaluated in @xcite and were found to increase the decay rate by about 1.7% .",
    "this effect is almost canceled by accounting for the finite width of the @xmath29 , which decreases the rate by about @xmath33 @xcite . in the present paper",
    "these both effects will be neglected .",
    "present uncertainty in the theoretical prediction of the top quark width is to a large extent connected with the unknown two - loop qcd corrections @xcite and the need for their complete evaluation has been repeatedly emphasized .",
    "this paper is devoted to this calculation .",
    "an exact computation of this effect would be very difficult , but since the size of those corrections is expected to be small , it is justified to make some approximations . in the present calculation we neglect the mass of the @xmath29 ; the error is expected to be of the order @xmath34 .",
    "level , the difference between the qcd correction calculated for @xmath35 and the correction calculated for physical values of @xmath36 and @xmath37 is approximately @xmath38 . ]",
    "another , smaller source of error is inherent in the method we employ in this calculation .",
    "as described below , we use the difference of the @xmath26 and @xmath39 masses as an expansion parameter and calculate many ( about 20 ) terms of the series in this parameter",
    ". an error of up to @xmath40 is caused by the truncation of this series . in any case",
    ", the accuracy of our final result is completely sufficient for all applications which can presently be contemplated .    in this paper",
    "we consider @xmath29 as stable .",
    "part of the effects of its instability can be accounted for using the known results for the @xmath0 corrections to its hadronic width .",
    "there are also `` non  factorizable '' corrections due to an exchange of gluons between the top , or the @xmath39 quark resulting from its decay , and the quarks produced in the @xmath29 decay .",
    "we expect these effects to be additionally suppressed by @xmath41 .",
    "there is also another application of the calculations reported in this paper , related to the @xmath39 quark physics .",
    "the inclusive decay width @xmath42 is of interest for the extraction of the ckm matrix parameter @xmath43 .",
    "the @xmath0 corrections to @xmath1 presented below , after simple modifications can be used to obtain the corrections to the differential inclusive decay width @xmath44 at the point where the invariant mass of leptons vanishes .",
    "thus , the results reported here can be used in the future to estimate the second order qcd corrections to @xmath45 .",
    "most of the results presented here have been derived using methods described in @xcite in the context of @xmath46 decays .",
    "in addition , since the @xmath26 quark is much heavier than @xmath39 , we have to include three diagrams which result from `` non - planar '' interference of @xmath47 amplitudes .",
    "their calculation is described in some detail in the following section [ sec : ccc ] . in section [ sec : twoloop ] we present the numerical results for various values of the quark masses in the final state .",
    "our conclusions are given in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "since the top quark is significantly heavier than @xmath49 , the decay @xmath48 contributes to the width of the top at @xmath25 .",
    "the treatment of this decay channel is complicated by the presence of non - planar interference diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : c3 ] .",
    "@xmath50    in order to compute them , we expand around the point @xmath51 .",
    "the expansion variable is @xmath52 such that m_b = ( 1- ) .",
    "we introduce the following notations : @xmath53 the momenta of the virtual gluons which later split into @xmath54 pairs , namely : @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "@xmath57 are the @xmath39 quark momenta and @xmath58 is the antiquark momentum in the final state .",
    "@xmath29 denotes the @xmath29-boson momentum , @xmath26 is the top quark momentum . @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the momenta of the virtual top propagators : @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "@xmath39 is the momentum of the virtual @xmath39quark , @xmath63 .",
    "all propagators can be expanded around the static limit , because the configuration around which we expand is the top quark decaying into three @xmath39quarks at rest .",
    "for instance , the leading term in the expansion of the gluon propagator @xmath64 is @xmath65 .",
    "the virtual top propagators give : - , etc .",
    "therefore , no dependence on phase space variables remains in the expanded denominators and the integration over the phase space can be performed by successive factorization into two - particle phase spaces .",
    "first we introduce the vector @xmath66 which combines @xmath58 and @xmath67 : @xmath68",
    ". we decompose @xmath69 into components parallel and perpendicular ( in four - dimensional sense ) to the @xmath66 direction . after averaging over directions of the perpendicular components",
    "this phase space integration gives the volume factor r_2(h;p_4,p_5 ) = 2 .",
    "next , we combine @xmath66 and @xmath29 into @xmath70 .",
    "since @xmath29 is masseless , this phase space gives no square root function r_2(q;h , w ) = 2q^2-h^2q^2 .",
    "we are then left with @xmath71 phase space and two integrations over @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the integration limits are @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "also , the @xmath76 phase - space is given by klln function , the momentum of the @xmath77 in the rest frame of @xmath26 : r_2(t;q , p_3 ) = 2m_t^2 .",
    "finally , for @xmath72 and @xmath73 we introduce variables @xmath78 , defined by @xmath79 and @xmath80 . from the limits on @xmath72 and @xmath73 we find = ( m_t - m_b)^24m_b^2 - 1 ~and the volume of the phase space @xmath81 is given by r_2(t;q , p_3 ) = 4m_bm_t , where the last square root can be expanded in @xmath52 .",
    "also the @xmath82 expressed in terms of @xmath83 becomes proportional to @xmath84 . as a result",
    "we obtain an expression containing only half - integer or integer powers of @xmath83 which can be easily integrated .",
    "in the limit of vanishing @xmath29 mass , the width of the decay @xmath30 is given by the formula ( we neglect terms @xmath85 ) @xmath86 , \\label{eq : param}\\ ] ] where @xmath87 .",
    "in this paper we use @xmath88 determined in the @xmath89 scheme and @xmath90 are the pole masses . @xmath91 and",
    "@xmath92 is also known in a closed analytical form @xcite . in the limit of the vanishing @xmath39",
    "quark mass we have a_0 = 1 , a_1 = 54 - ^23 .",
    "@xmath93 is the main new result of the present paper .",
    "it can be divided up into 4 gauge invariant parts a_2 = ( c_f - c_a2 ) a_f + c_a a_a + t_rn_l a_l + t_r a_h , [ eq : a2 ] where @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 is the number of quark flavors whose masses can be neglected . for the top quark decay we take @xmath98 .",
    "@xmath99 are functions of the mass ratio of the @xmath39 and @xmath26 quarks .",
    "we have calculated them using an expansion around the equal mass case .",
    "the expansion parameter , @xmath100 is close to one , so that many terms of the series must be calculated in order to obtain good accuracy .",

    "for @xmath108 the resulting change is insignificant ; the magnitude of @xmath109 is decreased by less than 3% . ] for the purpose of the present application we have more than doubled the number of terms in the expansion .",
    "@xmath110 is analogous to @xmath111 , except that it now contains contributions of the top quark loop only .",
    "the @xmath39 quark loop and part of real @xmath112 pair radiation is accounted for by adjusting @xmath97 .",
    "there is , however , part of real @xmath112 pair production which can not be described in this way .",
    "it corresponds to the non - planar interference diagrams shown in fig .",

    "we note that @xmath113 has the largest error bar .",
    "this is because there are two separate series contributing to it : in addition to the series in @xmath122 there is also the non - planar contribution expanded in @xmath123 .",
    "both these series are separately divergent in the limit @xmath117 like @xmath124 .",
    "for this reason their reliable estimate near this limit is difficult and we have assigned a conservative error bar to the result . on the other hand , because of the color factors in eq.([eq : a2 ] ) , the final result for @xmath93 is not very sensitive to the relatively large error in @xmath113 .",
    "the expressions we have obtained for @xmath125 contain the first and second powers of @xmath126 .",
    "it turns out that the convergence of these series is improved if we rewrite these terms as @xmath127 , with @xmath106 and expand @xmath128 in @xmath107 .",
    "since @xmath129 approaches 1 much faster than @xmath107 , the remaining logs are smaller . because of the many terms which had to be evaluated for the coefficient functions @xmath119 , the results are rather lengthy and not suitable for publication in a journal .",

    "it is likely that the corrections to @xmath30 will be calculated analytically in the point @xmath130 .",
