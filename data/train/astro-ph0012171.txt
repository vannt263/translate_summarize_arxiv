    "the co(10 ) and ( 21 ) lines , which are usually used as a tracer of molecular hydrogen , originate in the large bulk of molecular gas at low and moderate temperatures , and therefore trace the total amount and distribution of molecular gas rather than the highly excited molecular gas close to regions of star formation .    to observe this warmer and denser molecular gas component",

    "we found that the co(32 ) emission is not confined to the nucleus of the galaxies , but rather extended , with the actual extent depending on the object . in some cases , the co(32 ) is as extended as the co(10 ) . in a few objects ,",
    "it was even detected in the spiral arms .",
    "nevertheless , the co(32 ) emission is more concentrated to the vicinity of star forming structures ( nuclear regions and spiral arms ) .",
    "this is shown by the difference in the co(32)/(10 ) line ratios between the very centers to regions located further out .",
    "the sizes of the central emission peaks , estimated by gaussian fits and deconvolution , are given in tab .  1",
    ".    the co(32 ) luminosity is enhanced in objects that contain a nuclear starburst or morphological peculiarities .",
    "the total power emitted in the co(32 ) line from the central regions ( i.e.  excluding spiral arms / outer disk ) is highest in the starburst galaxies ngc2146 , m82 , ngc3628 , and in the spiral galaxy m51 . when comparing the total power divided by the size of the emission region , the starbursts m82 and ngc253 show the highest values ( about @xmath20 times higher than the other objects ) , and ngc278 the smallest .    with the present spatial resolution , the line ratios seem to be independant of hubble type , color or luminosity .",
    "most galaxies with enhanced central star formation show line ratios of @xmath21 in the very inner center and @xmath22 at a radius of about 1kpc .",
    "those objects with a ring - like molecular gas distribution ( m82 and ngc4631 ) show lower ratios .",
    "the two galaxies that show co(32 ) emission distributed over their spiral arms ( ngc891 and m51 ) show very low line ratios despite their high infrared luminosities .",
    "this result suggests that co in these two objects reflects a large amount of molecular gas , rather than enhanced star formation efficiency .",
    "these observations have shown that it is necessary to study several types of galaxies in order to obtain results which are not biased towards starburst objects .",
    "further it is not sufficient to observe only one point per galaxy , since this can not account for differences of the co(32 ) spatial distribution .    in order to improve this study ,",
    "our group will survey more galaxies in the future .",
    "this will lead to better statistics of the findings presented here .",
    "even higher transitions of @xmath23co are considered , as well as observations of other isotopomers to restrict interpretations concerning optical depth effects .",
