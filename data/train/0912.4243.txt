    "the strong interactions among baryons are key to every aspect of our existence .",
    "the two- and higher - body interactions among protons and neutrons conspire to produce the spectrum of nuclei and the complicated chains of nuclear reactions that allow for the production of the elements forming the periodic table at the earliest times of our universe , in the stellar environments that follow , and in reactors and our laboratories .",
    "decades of experimental effort have provided a very - precise set of measurements of the nucleon - nucleon scattering cross sections over a wide range of energies  @xcite , and these cross sections have in turn given rise to the modern nuclear forces .",
    "these experimentally determined two - body forces , encoded by potentials such as @xmath7  @xcite and the chiral potentials  @xcite , when supplemented with three - body interactions , now provide the cornerstone of our theoretical description of nuclei  @xcite and their interactions .",
    "the two - nucleon forces are observed to be significantly more important than the three - nucleon forces , which , in turn , are significantly more important than the four - nucleon forces .",
    "present - day calculations are sufficiently precise that the inclusion of three - nucleon forces is required in order to post - dict the structure of light nuclei  @xcite . given the relatively small contributions of the three - nucleon and higher - body interactions to light - nuclei , where reliable calculations are presently possible , there is considerable uncertainty with regard to their form .",
    "this leads to enhanced uncertainties in the calculation of systems for which there is little or no experimental guidance , such as moderate to high - density neutron - rich environments , and more generally , nuclear environments at densities exceeding that of nuclear matter .    in dense nuclear systems",
    "it is not only the multi - nucleon forces that are difficult to quantify as non - nucleonic objects may play an important role . in a core - collapse supernova",
    ", it is the nuclear equation of state ( neos ) that ultimately dictates whether the system collapses into a neutron star or forms a black hole .",
    "this , in turn , is determined by the composition and structure of the hadronic matter in the core of the supernova , which is at ( baryon number ) densities that are a few times that of nuclear matter . at such densities ,",
    "the strange quark may play a pivotal role through the formation of a charged kaon condensate made possible by the strength of attractive kaon - nucleon interactions .",
    "it may also become energetically favorable for the matter to contain strange baryons , such as the @xmath8 or @xmath9 , because of their interactions with nucleons . in either case , it is the two - body interactions between the strange hadrons and the nucleons , and also between themselves , that largely determine the composition of the hadronic matter at core - collapse densities , and ultimately the fate of the collapsing supernova  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , experimental determinations of the interactions of strange hadrons are very challenging due to their weak decays , and existing cross - section measurements are not precise enough to provide meaningful constraints on the neos at core - collapse densities .",
    "so , while it is the interactions between three - nucleons that currently limit the precision with which properties of material composed of neutrons and protons can be calculated , it is the two - body interactions involving strange hadrons that currently provide the most serious limitation to reliable calculations at densities that exceed that of nuclear matter .",
    "one of the major objectives of lattice qcd ( lqcd ) is to calculate the properties and interactions of nucleons and , more generally , systems comprised of multiple hadrons .",
    "precise exploration of the simplest multi - hadron systems has recently become possible with significant advances in computational resources , as well as through algorithmic and theoretical developments ( for a recent review , see ref  @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath10 two - pion system , @xmath11 , is the simplest of such multi - hadron systems to calculate in lqcd , and current computational resources have allowed for a @xmath12 level determination of the @xmath11 scattering length  @xcite .",
    "further , systems comprised of up to twelve @xmath13 s  @xcite and systems comprised of up to twelve @xmath14 s  @xcite have been explored , allowing a determination of the three-@xmath13 and three-@xmath14 interactions as well as aspects of pion and kaon condensates .",
    "in general , a determination of the two - particle scattering amplitude , or multi - body interactions , with lqcd requires calculating the energy eigenvalues of the appropriate two - hadron system in the finite volume  @xcite .",
    "the energy differences between the multi - particle energy levels in the finite volume and the sum of the particle masses determines the scattering amplitude at the corresponding energy .",
    "processes of interest to low - energy nuclear physics occur in the mev energy regime , while the masses of the baryons and nuclei are in the gev regime . as a result , very precise ( high - statistics ) measurements must be performed in order to reliably extract useful constraints on two- and higher - body interactions from a lattice calculation .",
    "in contrast to mesonic systems , lattice qcd calculations in the baryon sector are complicated by the statistical behavior of the correlation functions  @xcite .",
    "we performed the first unquenched lqcd calculation of nucleon - nucleon ( nn )  @xcite and hyperon - nucleon ( yn )  @xcite scattering lengths , and found that the nn scattering lengths appear to be of natural size at larger pion masses , and are set by the range of the interaction .",
    "consequently , an increase in the magnitude of the scattering length as the pion mass is reduced down to its physical value is anticipated .",
    "further , we have recently performed the first lattice qcd calculation of scattering in various meson - baryon channels  @xcite using the mixed - action scheme of domain - wall valence quarks on the milc staggered sea .",
    "recently , we have performed a high - statistics calculation of a number of single - hadron correlation functions  @xcite and also the first calculations of three - baryon systems  @xcite on an ensemble of the anisotropic gauge - field configurations generated by the hadron spectrum collaboration  @xcite .",
    "this ensemble has a pion mass of @xmath15 , a spatial lattice spacing of @xmath16 , an anisotropy @xmath17 and a lattice volume of @xmath18 .",
    "the goal of those studies was to `` jump '' an order of magnitude in the number of measurements performed to estimate correlation functions , and to explore the `` new territory '' that subsequently emerged .",
    "the baryon masses were extracted with fully quantified uncertainties at the @xmath19-level from the @xmath20 measurements performed on @xmath21 gauge - field configurations . with a somewhat smaller statistical sample , the binding energies of the @xmath22 ( triton @xmath23 @xmath24he by the isospin symmetry of the lqcd calculation ) and `` @xmath25 '' three - baryon systems were investigated and in the latter case , determined with an uncertainty of @xmath26 mev / baryon .",
    "subsequently , a study of the @xmath24he ( @xmath27 ) and @xmath28he ( @xmath29 ) systems in quenched qcd at a large quark mass appeared @xcite .",
    "a number of important and surprising observations were made in those works  @xcite that have modified how we foresee moving toward calculating the properties of light nuclei .",
    "one of the most important aspects of our previous work was the detailed study of the signal - to - noise ratio in the single - baryon correlation functions .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio was found to be approximately independent of time for a significant number of time - slices  @xcite prior to evolving toward the expected exponential degradation  @xcite .",
    "this window of time - slices is understood in terms of the suppression of contributions from purely mesonic states in the correlation function that determines the variance of the single - baryon correlation function .",
    "given that the signal - to - noise ratio for a system containing more than one baryon is expected to scale ( approximately ) as the product of the signal - to - noise ratio s of the individual baryons ( neglecting their interactions ) , this window of time slices suggests that calculations of the energy levels of systems containing a number of baryons in this lattice volume with these interpolating operators is possible . in this work we present the baryon - baryon scattering phase shifts that have been measured in our high - statistics anisotropic clover - quark calculation .",
    "our analysis and results are presented in the following manner . in section",
    "[ sec : latt - qcd - calc ] , we introduce the details of the formalism used in extracting phase shifts from our lqcd calculations .",

    "section [ sec : stat - behav ] details our analysis of statistical scaling and noise in the various correlation functions while section [ sec : discussion ] is a concluding discussion .",
    "in this work , the finite volume scaling method ( lscher s method )  @xcite is employed to extract the two - particle scattering amplitudes below inelastic thresholds at a given energy . in the situation where only a single scattering channel is kinematically allowed",
    ", the deviation of the energy eigenvalues of the two - hadron system in the lattice volume from the sum of the single - hadron masses is related to the scattering phase shift , @xmath30 . for energy eigenvalues above kinematic thresholds where multiple channels contribute ,",

    "the energy shift for two particles @xmath31 and @xmath32 , @xmath33 , can be determined from the correlation functions for systems containing one and two hadrons",
    ". for baryon - baryon systems , correlation functions of the form @xmath34 are used , where @xmath35 denotes a baryon interpolating operator , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are dirac indices , and the @xmath38 are spin tensors that typically project onto particular parity and/or angular momentum states .",

    "other hadrons in the lowest - lying octet can be obtained from the appropriate combinations of quark flavors .",
    "the parentheses in the interpolating operators indicate contraction of spin indices into a spin-0 `` diquark '' .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the overlap of the composite operator @xmath42 onto two - baryon states is not simply the product of individual baryon `` @xmath43-factors '' , but depends explicitly upon @xmath44 , with a correlation length set by the pion mass .",

    "as has been discussed extensively in the literature @xcite , it is not possible to directly extract the hadron - hadron potential ( unless one or more of the quarks in each hadron is infinitely heavy ) , but effective interactions that reproduce the measured scattering amplitudes can be constructed and used in the calculation of other quantities of interest , in the same way that the modern nn potentials are constructed to reproduce the experimentally - measured nn scattering cross - sections .",
    "the detailed exploration of the behavior of the signal - to - noise ratio in the baryon - baryon correlation functions , made possible by the very large number of measurements that have been performed , has been exceptionally illuminating .",
    "the importance of the `` golden window '' of time - slices in which the signal - to - noise ratio is essentially independent of time can not be overstated .",
    "this window allows for precise determinations of the energy - splitting between interacting baryons and isolated baryons , and in this window , the signal - to - noise ratio does not scale with baryon number , making precise measurements in multi - baryon systems feasible as discussed in ref .",
