    "the gamma - ray burst grb  990123 was an astrophysical event of astonishing proportions .",
    "it was the brightest burst yet detected with the wide - field cameras on the _ bepposax _ satellite @xcite , and has a total fluence among the brightest 0.3% of bursts detected by the batse instrument on the _ compton gamma - ray observatory _ ( cgro ) .",
    "optical observations , which began with the rotse - i telephoto array while the gamma - ray event was still in progress , detected an optical transient ( ot ) that reached a peak magnitude @xmath10 about 40 seconds after the start of the burst @xcite . within hours , spectroscopy revealed metal absorption lines in the spectrum of the ot at @xmath11 @xcite , constraining the grb redshift to be at least this great . if the gamma - ray burst emission was directed isotropically , the implied energy release is @xmath12ergs .    recognizing the importance of rapid observations of this object and the extraordinary level of interest in the astronomical community , _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( hst ) observations were scheduled using director s discretionary time , for immediate public release @xcite . to help ensure rapid access",
    ", we processed the data on the day of the observation and made the resulting images and a first report on the results of the imaging freely available on the web @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present a more detailed analysis , and combine the hst data with further optical images we have obtained at the palomar 5-m telescope .",
    "together these observations allow us to study both the light curve of the ot and the nature of the host galaxy of grb  990123 .",
    "the field of grb  990123 was observed by hst over the course of three orbits between 8 february 23:06:54 ut and 9 february 03:21:43 ut , using stis in clear aperture mode .",
    "two images of 650s each were taken at each of six dither positions for a total exposure time of 7800s .",
    "the images were processed using the standard stis data pipeline ; however , a `` dark '' was first constructed using data obtained the week before the observations , and this was used instead of the standard calibration file , dramatically reducing the number of hot pixels in the pipeline - calibrated image .",
    "the standard pipeline performed a first pass cosmic - ray removal using the two images at each dither position .",
    "remaining cosmic rays and hot pixels were eliminated and the images combined using the drizzle algorithm and associated techniques @xcite .",
    "the final output image was created with an output pixel size of @xmath13 on a side , or one - half that of the original pixels .",
    "a `` pixfrac '' of 0.6 was used .",
    "figure  1 shows the central region of the final image .",
    "the total counts associated with the ot were determined by two methods : 1 ) obtaining the counts above an estimated galactic background in an aperture with radius 4 output pixels , and then applying an aperture correction ( a factor of 1.5 ) determined using a stis psf star obtained from the hst archives , and 2 ) directly subtracting the psf star from the image while scaling to minimize the image residuals .",
    "the values obtained by these methods agreed to 5% .",
    "the total counts in a box @xmath14 on a side were then found , and the counts from the ot were subtracted to obtain the counts associated with the galaxy .",
    "photometric calibration of the images was performed using the synthetic photometry package synphot in iraf / stsdas .",
    "we refer the reader to fruchter _",
    "et  al .  _",
    "( 1999c ) for further discussion of the stis / ccd and its photometric calibration .",
    "we find that on 1999 feb 9.05 ut , the ot of grb  990123 had a magnitude of @xmath15 , and the galaxy on which it is superposed was @xmath16 .",
    "( unless otherwise stated , all magnitudes in this paper are vega magnitudes , landolt 1992 ) .",
    "observations of the grb host were also obtained using the palomar 5-m telescope with the cosmic camera in direct imaging mode on 1999 feb 8.4 - 8.5 ut ( approximately 12 h before the hst observations ) .",
    "the detector in cosmic is a 2048x2048 ccd with 24micron pixels , projecting to @xmath17 on the sky .",
    "three dithered 300s exposures were obtained in b - band , 3x300s in v , and 4x300s in r. the seeing measured in the final images varies from @xmath18 in v to @xmath19 in b. photometric calibration was performed using images of the pg 1633 field ( landolt 1992 ) . a comparison to the fainter stars measured by nilakshi _",
    "et  al .  _",
    "( 1999 ) shows agreement to better than 0.1mag .",
    "aperture photometry of the host galaxy was performed using a 5-pixel radius aperture , and including a rough correction to large aperture derived from the curve - of - growth measured for bright nearby point sources .",
    "the resulting magnitudes are @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 . given the magnitude measured for the ot in the hst images taken hours later , we estimate that the galaxy alone is approximately 0.3 mags fainter .",
    "the usno a2.0 stars surrounding grb  990123 have been used by a number of observers as standards for performing relative photometry on the ot .",
    "we have therefore used our observations to recalibrate 47 of the usno a2.0 standards that fall in the frame and are sufficiently faint to avoid saturation .",
    "we find that in this region , the usno calibration is @xmath23mag too bright .",
    "this correction is in the opposite sense of that reported by skiff ( 1999 ) .",
    "in figure  2 , we show the r band light curve of the counterpart of grb  990123 , combining our observations with those reported in the literature . we have attempted to reduce all available observations to the photometric standards measured by nilakshi _",
    "et  al .  _",
    "observations by sagar _",
    "et  al .  _",
    "( 1999 ) and veillet ( 1999 ) have been directly referenced to these standards , and we have been able to reference published photometry from sokolov _",

    "( 1999 ) , yadigaroglu and halpern ( 1999 ) and halpern _ et  al .  _ ( 1999 ) to the same standards .",
    "other observations , including zhu and zhang ( 1999 ) , zhu , chen and zhang ( 1999 ) , and masetti _",
    "et  al .  _",
    "( 1999 ) were made relative to usno a1.0 stars .",
    "observations made relative to usno a2.0 stars @xcite were adjusted by 0.2mag , as indicated by our photometry of a2.0 stars described above .",
    "gunn r band observations made with the palomar 1.5-m telescope @xcite were reduced to cousins r assuming @xmath24 .",
    "observations using the rotse - i telephoto array and an unfiltered ccd @xcite were reported as approximate v magnitudes relative to catalog values for nearby reference stars .",
    "for these data , as well as the stis data , we have estimated the r band flux assuming @xmath25 , consistent with the measured colors of the transient at later times @xcite .",
    "we have analyzed the ot light curve in terms of a broken power law . as seen in fig.2 ,",
    "at least three power - law segments are required to fully characterize the data .",
    "first , it is important to note that the measured power - law index at early times depends strongly on the assumed time origin .",
    "one common choice is the batse trigger time .",
    "however , this time is strongly dependent on the particular design of the batse instrument , and particularly on the trigger energy band , since both the gamma - ray onset and duration were strongly energy dependent .",
    "the osse and comptel instruments on cgro detected a much narrower burst from grb  990123 at mev energies @xcite than did batse in the hard x - ray .",
    "in fig.2 we have chosen the time origin to be the time of peak hard x - ray and gamma - ray emission , which was independent of energy . with this choice of origin ,",
    "the rotse data are well - described by a simple power - law decay , with @xmath26 .",
    "using the batse trigger as an origin would steepen the curve at early times , and produce a poorer fit .",
    "independent of the choice of time origin , r band observations made between 0.16 and 2.75days after the grb are well described by a power law with index @xmath27 .",
    "the data are consistent with a break to this shallower decay slope @xmath28minutes after the grb , though more complicated light curve behavior during the data gap between 10min and 3.8hrs can not be ruled out . beginning one week after the grb @xcite , the data are consistently fainter than the extrapolation of the @xmath29 power law ; the ot magnitude measured by stis is @xmath30mags fainter than expected .",
    "if the fading behavior of the transient since day four is described by another power law , its slope must be at least as steep as @xmath31 , as can be seen in fig .  2 , but a slope as steep as @xmath32 can not be ruled out . determining whether this is a true break in the long - term fading behavior , or a temporary fluctuation around a long term @xmath33 power law ( as was seen in the grb  970228 light curve , fruchter _",
    "et  al .  _",
    "1999c ) will require further observations . if the ot continues to fade at @xmath31",
    ", it will become essentially undetectable , even from hst , in the spring of 1999 .",
    "there are numerous possible physical causes for the observed breaks in the ot light curve , and in the absence of broadband spectral information a definitive classification of temporal breaks is impossible .",
    "one physically plausible way to account for the early break from steep decay to shallower decay at early times is to suppose that the early ( @xmath34days ) , rapidly fading optical flash arises in the reverse shock that propagates from the fireball - ism boundary back into the ejecta material , while the more slowly fading optical emission seen on timescales of a few hours arises in the forward shock propagating into the ism @xcite .",
    "a possibility for a break to a steeper power law at late times is the spread of the opening angle of a strongly beamed ( or jet dominated ) flow @xcite .",
    "this occurs when fireball material has decelerated to @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the opening angle of the beam .",
    "however , mszros and rees ( 1999 ) have pointed out that a break may occur at this time due to the observer beginning to see the edge of the jet .",
    "they predict an increase in the power - law index of @xmath37 , which is approximately equal to the lower - limit of the break observed here .",
    "eleven ots associated with grbs have been reported , at least nine of which are well established , and with at most one exception these appear to lie on host galaxies @xcite .",
    "reasonable models predict that in about 20% of cases the host galaxy will be fainter than @xmath38 , and thus too faint to be detected by the ground - based telescopes that have been used @xcite .",
    "the association between grbs and galaxies is hence well established , leading to a reasonable presumption that a galaxy coincident with a grb is its host .",
    "the particular case of grb  990123 ( as in 970508 , metzger _",
    "et  al .  _",
    "1997 ) is even stronger , because spectra obtained by the keck and not telescopes show a deep metal line absorption system at @xmath39 @xcite , but no evidence of other absorption line systems .    given that the observed galaxy is at @xmath11 ,",
    "what can we learn about it from the optical observations presented here , and the k band data reported by bloom _",
    "et  al .",
    "_ 1999 ? ( note : bloom _ et  al .",
    "_ also discuss the hst data analyzed here . ) in fig .  3 , we compare the colors of the host galaxy with those of other objects in the hdf - n @xcite and with those of two other host galaxies , grb  980703 @xcite and grb  970228 @xcite .",
    "as is common in papers on the hdf , the colors are shown in ab magnitudes ( for all colors , ab mag @xmath40jy ) .",
    "all three hosts lie on the locus which defines the bluest edge of observed galaxies .",
    "unfortunately , there are few galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts @xmath41 that are as faint as the host of grb  990123 ; however , one can compare this object to galaxies in the hdf which have estimated spectroscopic redshifts of @xmath41 using the catalog of fernandez - soto , lanzetta and yahil ( 1999 ) .",
    "one finds that the host is among the bluest of galaxies at that redshift in @xmath42 , but it is not particularly bright .",
    "indeed there are of order a dozen galaxies in that catalog in the range @xmath43 which are brighter in the _ blue _ ( rest frame uv ) than the host of grb  990123 .",
    "therefore while the host is rapidly star - forming for its mass ( or population of old stars ) it is not a particularly bright galaxy .",
    "the position of the grb on the host can also provide information on the progenitors of these extraordinary outbursts .",
    "we now have four grbs with hst imaging : 970228 @xcite , 970508 @xcite , 971214 @xcite and 990123 . in all four cases ,",
    "the ot occurs superposed on the stellar field .",
    "thus neutron - star  neutron - star mergers , which on occasion should happen well outside the stellar field due to kicks given by supernovae at their birth @xcite , are perhaps disfavored both by this evidence , and by the fact stated earlier that nearly all ots have host galaxies .",
    "however , it is possible that without a dense external working surface no ot would appear @xcite , so by only localizing grbs with bright ots we may be selecting for events which occur in stellar fields .",
    "if all grbs at cosmological distances are produced by the same mechanism , then the images of grb  970228 would have ruled out agn as the source of grbs : grb  970228 lies at the edge of an undistinguished galactic disk . on the other hand",
    "it is difficult to use grb  990123 as further evidence against agn , for if one were to ask what local galaxy the host of grb  990123 resembles , one might well choose ngc  4038/4039the `` antennae , '' the most well - known galaxy merger @xcite . in the early stages of merger , the massive black hole(s ) need not be near the apparent center of the remnant .",
    "furthermore , if more than one mechanism causes cosmological grbs , then one must wonder whether the remarkable @xmath44 coincidence of grb  970508 with the center of that regular host galaxy @xcite suggests the presence of a nuclear starburst or a massive black hole .",
    "we wish to thank steven beckwith , the director of stsci , for using director s discretionary time to observe grb  990123 and for making the data public .",
    "we also thank jen christensen for assistance in creating appropriate stis dark files . note : the reduced hst images discussed in this paper can be retrieved in fits format from http://www.stsci.edu/  fruchter / grb/990123 .",
