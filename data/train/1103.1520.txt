    "the sun is the only star whose features can be studied in great detail and on long time scale , forming a paradigm for a large population of sun - like stars .",
    "the sun exhibits a great deal of magnetic variability generically called the solar activity , which is grossly dominated by the quasi - periodic @xmath011-year cycle . on top of that",
    ", secular variability is superposed ranging from very high activity during the late 20-th century down to very quiet periods of grand minima @xcite .",
    "generally , the 11-year cyclicity is understood in terms of solar dynamo @xcite , while the secular / millenial variability still remains unclear .",
    "a particular enigma for solar / stellar dynamo is the occurrence of grand minima , that is not an intrinsic feature of the standard mean - field dynamo @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the occurrence of grand minima is often modelled by an _ ad hoc _ approach , including , e.g. , stochastic or chaotic driven processes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , observational constraints on solar / stellar dynamo with respect to grand minima are crucially important .",
    "while the statistic of grand minima / maxima of solar activity is studied to some extent using the cosmogenic isotope data @xcite , the variability of solar activity during and around a grand minimum is not precisely known .",
    "this is caused by the fact that presently we have more or less detailed information on only one grand minimum - the maunder minimum in the second half of 17-th century @xcite , which serves as an archetype for grand minima in general . the present paradigm for a general scenario of a grand minimum ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) is widely considered as a constraint for solar dynamo models . therefore , every piece of information on solar activity during that period is extremely valuable .",
    "temporal variability of solar activity around the maunder minimum is usually studied using historical telescopic observations of sunspots since 1610 @xcite .",
    "the period before the maunder minimum ( i.e. , the first half of the 17-th century ) was very uncertain in the original wolf sunspot series , but the data were greatly improved after tremendous work of @xcite and @xcite , who collected large amount of historical sunspot records , forming the group sunspot number ( gsn ) series . the solar activity variability before 1650 ad is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : t ] according to the official gsn series ( dotted curve ) and reanalyzed with improved statistical techniques ( * ? ? ?",
    "*  grey curve ) .",
    "the first observed solar cycle 16101618 was pretty high ( maximum annual gsn values above 100 ) , and this is quite reliable as it was covered by the direct data including sunspot drawings and counts @xcite .",
    "the second cycle 16181630 was lower ( maximum gsn values 3040 ) , but the quality of data is not good .",
    "the next cycle 16351645 is marked as high in the gsn series , and this gave rise to the idea of an abrupt onset of the general grand minimum scenario .",
    "however , the gsn series is also not complete , and new data , which remained unnoticed by wolf and his successors including hoyt & schatten , are continuously recovered in various places , often outside major observatories @xcite .",
    "this leads to a revision of some parts of the gsn series and requires re - analysis of some results . here",
    "we reconsider the paradigm of grand minimum general scenario by using newly recovered sunspot observations as well as revising some earlier uncertain data for the period 16361642 , i.e. , one solar cycle before the beginning of the maunder minimum .",
    "as discussed in great detail by @xcite sunspot data in 16101644 ( before the maunder minimum ) contains numerous gaps and uncertainties .",
    "this problem is specially acute for the period from 1636 through 1642 . for that period",
    "the following data sets were available in the gsn series : ( 1 ) three years ( 1636 , 1637 and 1641 ) without any solar observational record ; ( 2 ) two years ( 1640 and 1642 ) with little amount of records by horrox , gassendi , hevelius , scheiner and rheita ( 2 and 37 , respectively ) ; and ( 3 ) two years ( 1638 and 1639 ) with estimated data based on crabtree data .",
    "here we use the gsn database ( ftp://ftp.ngdc.noaa.gov/stp/solar_data/ sunspot_numbers / group_sunspot_numbers/ ) , but critically revise it for 16361642 .",
    "first we add newly recovered sunspot data by g. marcgraf which are not included into the gsn database .",
    "georg marcgraf ( 16101648 ) was a german naturalist and astronomer @xcite .",
    "we have consulted his manuscripts of astronomical observations preserved in leiden regional archive ( collection marcgraf lb7000/1 ) and in the national library of portugal ( mss .",
    "6 , n@xmath1 37 ) .",
    "we have recovered sunspot records for the year 1637 , just the year with no records in the gsn database .",
    "these records are preserved in the collection marcgraf ( leiden regional archive , lb7000/1 ) in the documents labelled as 22 , 24a , 24b and 52 according to the numeration made by the historian of science john north in the 1980s ( north 1989 ) .",
    "[ fig : m ] depicts an example of solar disc drawings by marcgraf showing one sunspot from 9 to 12 june 1637 ( document 24a ) .",
    "sunspot records by marcgraf cover 17 days of 1637 , that were included in the new database ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "another addition is correction of horrox s records .",
    "jeremiah horrocks or horrox ( 16181641 ) was an english astronomer who predicted , observed and recorded the transit of venus in 1639 .",
    "his sunspot records appeared in his opera posthuma @xcite .",
    "horrox used the julian calendar and , therefore , we have converted these dates to gregorian calendar @xcite . moreover , horrox noted  maculae duas in sole ",
    "( two spots in the sun ) in 30 oct  1 nov 1638 .",
    "we have interpreted these two spots as one sunspot group to make this record compatible with the only group observed by gassendi on the same dates .",
    "next we noted that the filling of the years 1638 and 1639 in gsn was done based on an unclear estimate rather than on real data .",
    "@xcite wrote in their bibliography appendix :  according to a letter by crabtree the average number of spot groups seen in 1638 and 1639 were 4 - 5 per day .",
    "the database has greenwich fill values to give 4 - 5 groups per day .",
    "this substitution technique was used to simplify the analysis .",
    "this is the only place in the entire database where we do this type of substitution .",
    " however , the number of the actually observed groups was smaller than the number of estimated groups for these years in the reconstruction ( see figure 5 in * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , we decided not to use this non - observed values for our estimations and eliminate crabtree data .",
    "we have also made some minor corrections to the database using the original sources .",
    "we have eliminated one spurious observation by gassendi on 1 dec 1638 , because this record does not appear in his astronomical observations @xcite . moreover ,",
    "we have incorporated one sunspot record by horrox in 4 december 1639 .",
    "curiously , the treatise `` venus in sole visa '' [ venus in transit across the sun ] by horrox was published by johannes hevelius at his own expense in 1662 @xcite . in this work",
    ", horrox noted that he saw one small and common spot in the sun on 4 dec 1639 ( p. 115",

    "all these additions and changes in the original hoyt and schatten database are listed in table  [ tab1 ] and summarized below :    1 .",

    "a spurious observation by gassendi on 1 december 1638 is eliminated ; 5 .",
    "one missing sunspot record by horrox in 4 december 1639 is added .",
    "the record by rheita in 1642 is corrected .    using the revised data presented in table  [ tab1 ]",
    ", we have evaluated the annual sunspot numbers for the period of 16371642 , employing the statistical method proposed by @xcite .",
    "the method is based on comparing the actual sparse data ( sample population ) to the daily sunspot data in 18501996 ( reference population ) , assuming constancy of the statistical properties of sunspot activity . for a given sample population of daily measurements within a month",
    ", months in the reference population are found that contain the same subset of daily values . a statistical distribution of the corresponding monthly means",
    "is then built that allows to estimate the mean and uncertainty of monthly sunspot numbers , reconstructed from sparse daily observations ( see full details in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . from monthly mean values ,",
    "yearly values can be obtained in the same way .",
    "the newly computed yearly sunspot numbers for 16371642 are given in table  [ tab2 ] and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : t ] as thick solid line with error bars .    as one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : t ] , the revised and updated data for 16371642 has essentially changed the profile of temporal variability of sunspot data before the maunder minimum . in particular , the last solar cycle before the",
    "minimum now appears quite modest , with the peak value of @xmath2 compared to about 70 in the gsn series .",
    "the new scenario , in accordance with the new database , implies low solar activity roughly two solar cycles before the beginning of the maunder minimum .",
    "this suggests that transition from the normal activity to the deep minimum was not as sudden as previously thought @xcite , and the descent of solar activity might have started as early as in the 1610s .",
    "since the maunder minimum forms an archetype for the grand minima , detailed knowledge of its temporal development has important consequences for the solar dynamo theory dealing with long - term solar activity evolution . the general dynamo theory ( see , e.g. * ?",
    "* ) can not naturally reproduce occurrence of grand minima and requires some prescribed changes in the dynamo parameters . the present paradigm for the maunder minimum ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is that transition from the normal high activity to the deep minimum was sudden ( within a few years ) and without any apparent precursor , while the recovery to the normal activity level was gradual , taking several decades .",
    "the abrupt onset of a grand minima forms a strong constraint , as only few models with stochastically driving forces can naturally produce such a feature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while others require special _ ad hoc _ assumptions .",
    "presently , several models can reproduce , with different approaches , the proposed scenario of a grand minimum ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , many dynamo models succeed in predicting grand minima to start gradually , through a continuous decrease of the activity level to the deep minimum , followed by a gradual recovery .",
    "just to mention a few , @xcite .",
    "thus , it is crucial to know the solar activity evolution before the maunder minimum with high confidence .",
    "the revised sunspot records presented here imply that the scenario of the maunder minimum can correspond to a gradual onset , contrary to the earlier consideration , thus affecting observational constraints on the solar / stellar dynamo .",
    "unfortunately , cosmogenic isotope data can hardly resolve individual cycles @xcite to clearly answer this question , but a cautious statistical study of radiocarbon @xmath3c data in tree rings for the maunder and sprer solar minima indicate a possible lengthening and attenuation of solar cycles a few decades before the onset of a grand minimum @xcite .      1 .   using newly recovered sunspot records by georg marcgraf and carefully revised data for other observations ( table [ tab1 ] ) , we provide a new sunspot number series ( table  [ tab2 ] ) for the period 16361642 .",
    "2 .   the new data dramatically change the magnitude of the sunspot cycle just before the maunder minimum , from 6070 down to about 20 , implying a possibly gradual onset of the minimum with reduced activity started two cycles before it .",
    "this revised scenario of the maunder minimum changes , through the paradigm for grand solar / stellar activity minima , the observational constraint on the solar / stellar dynamo theories focused on long - term studies and occurrence of grand minima .",
    "thus , we have essentially revised the sunspot data prior to the maunder minimum leading to the revisited observational scenario of a grand minimum of solar activity .",
