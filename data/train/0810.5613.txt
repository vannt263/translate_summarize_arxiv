    "the synchronization of uni - directionally coupled chaotic systems have been studied reasonably well in the past few years @xcite .",
    "the synchronization state in such cases can be phase , lag , generalized or complete depending upon the strength of the coupling @xcite .",
    "recently synchronization of systems via coupling with a time delay , which presumably takes care of the finite propagation times , switching speeds and memory effects have been reported @xcite .",
    "such studies relate to a variety of diverse phenomena like chirping of crickets , neural networks , automatic steering and control and coupled phase locked lasers @xcite .",
    "when the coupling is not isochronous with the system dynamics , it is possible to realize retarded ( delay ) , complete and anticipatory synchronization of chaotic systems .",
    "moreover , synchronization in such cases reveal many novel phenomena like parametric resonance@xcite , multi - stable phase clustering @xcite , amplitude death etc @xcite .",
    "an interesting aspect of such delay induced synchronization , that has attracted lot of attention , is that the driven system can anticipate the dynamics of the driver @xcite .",
    "the maximum possible anticipation time is reported to be enhanced considerably by using an array or ring of such systems @xcite",
    ". experimental verification of anticipatory and retarded synchronization is reported in electronic circuits as well as semiconductor lasers with delayed optoelectronic feed back @xcite .",
    "in all these studies , the delay time in the coupling , once chosen , remains constant as the system evolves .",
    "the synchronization of chaotic systems , in general , has attracted great attention due its potential application in secure communication @xcite .",
    "however the use of low dimensional systems in this context is found to be insecure due to the ease of reconstruction from the transmitted signal @xcite .",
    "therefore recently , chaos synchronization in high dimensional systems , especially systems with an inherent time delay , has been proposed as a better alternative @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we propose a method of delay / anticipatory synchronization with coupling involving variable time delay . here",
    ", the synchronization can be realized with limited information about the driver via occasional contacts or feedbacks at specific intervals .",
    "this makes the method highly cost effective and can be applied to cases where the signal transmission from driver is slow or intermittent .",
    "this is achieved by using a variable delay in the coupling that is reset at definite intervals .",
    "the dynamics then evolves under three additional time scales , the delay @xmath0 , the anticipatory time @xmath1 and the reset time @xmath2 . unlike the case of fixed delay",
    ", the resetting mechanism makes the error dynamics discrete and it is possible to carry out an approximate analytic analysis .",
    "the analysis gives the maximum @xmath1 for a given @xmath2 .",
    "this also fixes the regions of stability in the parameter plane of coupling and delay .",
    "the method is demonstrated for standard systems like rssler and lorenz .",
    "consider a dynamical system @xmath3 of dimension @xmath4 that drives an identical system @xmath5 .",
    "we choose a simple coupling term of the linear difference type but with the drive variable delayed by @xmath0 and the driven variable delayed by @xmath1 .",
    "thus , the dynamics is given by    [ system_def ] @xmath6    where @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath2 is the resetting time and @xmath9 is an indicator function such that @xmath10 and zero otherwise . here ,",

    "we take only one coponent of @xmath12 to be nonzero .",
    "both the delays @xmath13 and @xmath14 depend on time and we choose this dependence as @xmath15 thus , @xmath16 .",
    "as the two systems evolve , @xmath13 and @xmath14 also evolve with the same time scale and the coupling term uses the same value of both variables @xmath17 and @xmath18 during each resetting time interval @xmath2 , i.e. the coupling term is constant for the time interval @xmath2 . in each time interval",
    "@xmath2 , the initial values of the delays @xmath13 and @xmath14 are @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively .",
    "the delays increase linearly with time upto values @xmath19 and @xmath20 and then they are reset for the next interval . as a consequence ,",
    "the coupling requires the variable of the drive system only at discrete time intervals of @xmath2 .",
    "we also note that @xmath21 for all @xmath22 .",
    "synchronization manifold for the coupled systems ( [ system_def ] ) is defined by @xmath23 thus , we can get all the following three possibilities @xcite .",
    "( 1 ) if @xmath24 , we can get delay or lag synchronization with @xmath25 as the lag time . ( 2 ) if @xmath26 , we can get anticipatory synchronization with @xmath27 as the anticipation time . ( 3 ) if @xmath28 , we can get equal time synchronization .    as an illustration of this , we take the standard rssler oscillator in the chaotic state as the driver described by the equations @xmath29 this is coupled to an identical system through the coupling scheme given in eq .",

    "taking the parameter values @xmath33 and @xmath34 , both the systems are evolved from random initial conditions using runge kutta algorithm with a time step 0.01 for 2000 units of time . with @xmath35 and the coupling strength @xmath36 , the resulting time series obtained for @xmath0=0.84 and @xmath1 = 0.02 is plotted in fig.1.a . here the response system y(t)(dashed line ) lags behind the driver x(t)(solid line ) by @xmath37 .",
