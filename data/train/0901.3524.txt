    "we discuss the effects of the lightest neutrino mass in thermal leptogenesis @xcite where lepton flavor dynamics @xcite@xmath2@xcite plays an important role in the generation of the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe and the cp - violation required for the baryogenesis mechanism to work is due exclusively to the dirac and/or majorana cp - violating phases in the pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns )  @xcite neutrino mixing matrix .",
    "a detailed investigation of these effects was performed in reference @xcite .",
    "we review some of the results obtained in @xcite .",
    "the minimal scheme in which leptogenesis can be implemented is the non - supersymmetric version of the type i see - saw  @xcite model with two or three heavy right - handed ( rh ) majorana neutrinos .",
    "taking into account the lepton flavour effects in leptogenesis it was shown @xcite ( see also @xcite ) that if the heavy majorana neutrinos have a hierarchical spectrum , the observed baryon asymmetry @xmath3 can be produced even if the only source of cp - violation is the majorana and/or dirac phase(s ) in the pmns matrix @xmath4 . in this case the predicted value of the baryon asymmetry depends explicitly ( i.e. directly ) on @xmath0 and on the cp - violating phases in @xmath0 .",
    "the results quoted above were demonstrated to hold both for normal hierarchical ( nh ) and inverted hierarchical ( ih ) spectrum of masses of the light majorana neutrinos . in both these cases",
    "they were obtained for negligible lightest neutrino mass and cp - conserving elements of the orthogonal matrix @xmath1 , present in the `` orthogonal '' parametrisation @xcite of the matrix of neutrino yukawa couplings .",
    "the cp - invariance constraints imply that the matrix @xmath1 could conserve the cp - symmetry if its elements are real or purely imaginary . and the `` high energy '' cp - violating phases in a complex orthogonal matrix @xmath1 , in thermal `` flavoured '' leptogenesis scenario , was addressed in @xcite and @xcite . ]",
    "we remark that for a cp - conserving matrix @xmath1 and at temperatures @xmath5 gev , the lepton flavours are indistinguishable ( one flavour approximation ) and the total cp - asymmetry is always zero . in this case",
    "no baryon asymmetry is produced .",
    "one can prove @xcite that , for nh spectrum and negligible lightest neutrino mass @xmath6 successful thermal leptogenesis can be realised for a real matrix @xmath1 .",
    "in contrast , in the case of ih spectrum and negligible lightest neutrino mass ( @xmath7 ) , the requisite baryon asymmetry was found to be produced for cp - conserving matrix @xmath1 only if certain elements of @xmath1 are purely imaginary : for real @xmath1 the baryon asymmetry @xmath3 is strongly suppressed and leptogenesis can not be successful for @xmath8 ( i.e. in the regime in which the lepton flavour effects are significant @xcite ) .    in the present article",
    "we discuss the effects of the lightest neutrino mass on `` flavoured '' ( thermal ) leptogenesis .",
    "we consider the case when the cp - violation necessary for the generation of the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe is due exclusively to the dirac and/or majorana cp - violating phases in the pmns matrix @xmath0 .",
    "the results we review correspond to the simplest type i see - saw scenario with three heavy rh majorana neutrinos @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "the latter are assumed to have a hierarchical mass spectrum , @xmath11 . as a consequence ,",
    "the generated baryon asymmetry @xmath3 depends linearly on the mass of @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and on the elements @xmath14 of the matrix @xmath1 , @xmath10 , present in the orthogonal parametrisation of neutrino yukawa couplings of @xmath12 .",
    "as was already mentioned previously , this parametrisation involves an orthogonal matrix @xmath1 , @xmath15 . although , in general , the matrix @xmath1 can be complex , i.e. cp - violating , in @xcite we were primarily interested in the possibility that @xmath1 conserves the cp - symmetry .",
    "we report results of the two types of light neutrino mass spectrum allowed by the data @xcite : i ) with normal ordering ( @xmath16 ) , @xmath17 , and ii ) with inverted ordering ( @xmath18 ) , @xmath19 .",
    "the case of inverted hierarchical ( ih ) spectrum and real ( and cp - conserving ) matrix @xmath1 is reviewed in detail .    the analysis in @xcite was performed for negligible renormalisation group ( rg ) running of @xmath20 and of the parameters in the pmns matrix @xmath21 from @xmath22 to @xmath13 .",
    "this possibility is realised for sufficiently small values of the lightest neutrino mass @xmath23  @xcite , e.g. , for @xmath24",
    "the latter condition is fulfilled for the nh and ih neutrino mass spectra , as well as for spectrum with partial hierarchy @xcite . under the indicated condition @xmath20 , and correspondingly @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and @xmath0",
    "can be taken at the scale @xmath27 , at which the neutrino mixing parameters are measured .",
    "following the discussion in @xcite , we introduce combinations between the elements of the neutrino mixing matrix @xmath0 and the orthogonal matrix @xmath1 that appears in the casas - ibarra parametrisation @xcite of the matrix of neutrino yukawa couplings : @xmath28 if cp - invariance does nt hold , then one can easily prove that @xmath29 is not a real quantity : @xmath30 in the parametrisation of the neutrino yukawa couplings considered , the condition ( [ cp - cons ] ) triggers cp - violation in the thermal leptogenesis scenario , when the dynamics of the flavour states plays a role in the generation of the baryon asymmetry of the universe . in particular , from ( [ p ] )",
    "it is possible to understand what is the interplay between the `` low energy '' cp violation , encoded in the majorana and/or dirac phases present in the neutrino mixing matrix @xmath0 , and the `` high energy '' cp - violating phases of the matrix @xmath1 and to disentangle the two contributions . in the present article",
    "we are primarily interested in the situation in which the cp - violation necessary for having successful leptogenesis can arise exclusively from `` low energy '' physics in the lepton sector .",
    "for this reason , we impose the orthogonal matrix @xmath1 to satisfy cp - invariance constraints , i.e. all the matrix elements , @xmath31 , are real or purely imaginary .",
    "if this is the case , cp - violation , and therefore condition ( [ cp - cons ] ) , is accomplished through the the neutrino mixing matrix @xmath0 ( `` low energy '' cp - violation ) . for real or purely imaginary @xmath32 , @xmath33 , the cp - asymmetries @xmath34",
    "is given by@xmath35 with @xmath36 and @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",
    "note that , according to condition ( [ cp - cons ] ) , real ( purely imaginary ) @xmath40 and purely imaginary ( real ) @xmath41 , @xmath39 , implies violation of cp - invariance by the matrix @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "an interesting possibility is for example when the dirac phase @xmath42 and the effective majorana phases @xmath43 , @xmath44 take the cp - conserving values : @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "then , for real @xmath14 , @xmath10 , condition ( [ cp - cons ] ) is fulfilled and the cp - asymmetry @xmath48 is different from zero .",
    "we say in this case that both the pmns matrix and the orthogonal matrix are cp - conserving , but the neutrino yukawa couplings still violate cp - symmetry .",
    "more specifically , it is impossible to construct a high energy observable that is sensitive to cp - symmetry breaking and depends only on the matrix @xmath1 .",
    "the only possibility to break the symmetry at high energy scales is to couple the matrix @xmath1 to the pmns neutrino mixing matrix , as in @xmath48 .    in order for the cp - symmetry to be broken at low energies",
    ", we should have both @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( see @xcite for further details on this point ) .",
    "the case of inverted hierarchical ( ih ) neutrino mass spectrum , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , is of particular interest since , as was already mentioned , for real @xmath14 , @xmath10 , ih spectrum and negligible lightest neutrino mass @xmath53 , it is impossible to generate the observed baryon asymmetry @xmath54 in the regime of `` flavoured '' leptogenesis @xcite , i.e. for @xmath8 , if the only source of cp - violation are the majorana and/or dirac phases in the pmns matrix .",
    "it can be proven that for @xmath55 and @xmath56 , the resulting baryon asymmetry is always suppressed by the factor @xmath57 .",
    "we analyse the generation of the baryon asymmetry @xmath3 for real @xmath14 , @xmath10 , when @xmath7 is non - negligible .",
    "we assume that @xmath3 is produced in the two - flavour regime , @xmath58 gev . under these conditions",
    "the terms @xmath59 in @xmath34 will be dominant provided @xcite @xmath60 this condition can be easily satisfied if @xmath61 , or @xmath62 , and if @xmath7 is sufficiently large .",

    "we have found that in the case of ih spectrum with non - negligible @xmath7 , @xmath84 , the generated baryon asymmetry @xmath83 can be strongly enhanced in comparison with the asymmetry @xmath83 produced if @xmath53",
    ". the enhancement can be by a factor of @xmath85 , or even by a larger factor . as a consequence",
    ", one can have successful leptogenesis for ih spectrum with @xmath86 ev even if the elements @xmath14 of @xmath1 are real and the requisite cp - violation is provided by the majorana or dirac phase(s ) in the pmns matrix . as a consequence , successful thermal leptogenesis is realised for @xmath87 ev .",

[",

    "the values of the lightest neutrino mass and the elements @xmath104 , @xmath105 , are chosen in such a way as to maximise the baryon asymmetry @xmath83 .",
    "we remark that a value of @xmath106 , majorana cp - conserving phases @xmath46 and @xmath47 and real matrix @xmath1 imply `` low energy '' cp - violation due to the neutrino mixing matrix , but a `` high energy '' contribution associated with the matrix @xmath1 is still present , as already discussed in section 2 .",
    "for this reason we did nt consider this possibility in the reported results .",
