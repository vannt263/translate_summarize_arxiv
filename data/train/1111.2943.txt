    "a survey is given of some recent work on the infinitesimal dynamics of _ crystal frameworks _ ,",
    "by which we mean translationally periodic discrete bar - joint frameworks in @xmath3 .",
    "this includes a discussion of rigidity operators , matrix symbol function representations and the connections with models for low energy phonon modes in various material crystals .",
    "these modes are also known as rigid unit modes , or rums , reflecting their origin in the relative motion of rigid units in the crystalline structure .",
    "i also introduce briefly the contexts of semi - infinite crystal frameworks and bicrystal frameworks and indicate how their rigidity operators involve multivariable toeplitz operators whose symbol functions are matrices over multi - variable trigonometric polynomials on the @xmath4-torus .    the topic of infinite bar - joint frameworks , whether periodic or not , can be pursued as a purely mathematical endeavour and many aspects of deformability and rigidity remain to be understood .",
    "the main perspectives below and related issues are developed in owen and power @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and power @xcite , @xcite .",
    "translationally periodic bond / node bar - joint frameworks or networks are ubiquitous in mathematics ( periodic tilings for example ) , solid state physics ( crystal lattices , graphene ) , solid state chemistry ( zeolites ) and material science ( microporous metal organic frameworks ) .",
    "so there is no lack of interesting examples .",
    "i shall illustrate a number of concepts with three examples derived from tilings seen in seville at the alcazaar and the cathedral .",
    "we begin by outlining one particualr motivation from material science .",
    "a crystal framework @xmath5 in @xmath6 can serve as a mathematical model for the essential geometry of the disposition of atoms and bonds in a material crystal @xmath7 . in the model of interest to us the vertices correspond to certain atoms while the edges correspond in some way to strong bonds .",
    "also the identification of strongly bonded `` units '' in @xmath7 imply a polyhedral net structure and it is this that gives the relevant abstract framework @xmath5 .",
    "a fundamental example of this kind is quartz , sio@xmath8 , in which each silicon atom lies at the centre of a strongly bonded sio@xmath2 unit , which in turn may be modeled as a tetrahedron with an oxygen atom at each vertex . in this way",
    "the material crystal quartz provides a mathematical crystal framework of pairwise connected tetrahedra with a particular connectedness and geometry .",
    "material scientists are interested in the manifestation and explanation of various forms of low energy motion and oscillation in materials . of particular interest",
    "are the rigid unit modes in aluminosilicate crystals and zeolites , where quite complicated tetrahedral net models are relevant .",
    "these low energy ( long wavelength ) phonon modes are observed in neutron scattering experiments and have been shown to correlate closely with the modes observed in computational simulations .",
    "there is now a considerable body of literature tabulating the ( reduced ) wave vectors of rums of various crystals as subsets of the unit cube ( brillouin zone ) and it has become evident that the primary determinant is the geometric structure of the abstract frameworks @xmath5 .",
    "see , for example , dove et al @xcite , hammond et al @xcite , @xcite , giddy et al @xcite and swainson and dove @xcite . particularly intriguing is the simulation study in dove et al @xcite which gives a range of pictures of the rum spectrum and multiplicites for various idealized crystal types .    in the experiments and in the simulations",
    "the background mathematical model is classical lattice dynamics and rigid unit modes are observed where the phonon dispersion curves indicate vanishing energy .",
    "however , one can also identify such limiting cases through a direct linear approach as we outline below and from this it follows that these sets ( at least in simulations ) may be viewed as real algebraic varieties .",
    "see theorem [ t : phaserigiditymatrix ] below , @xcite , @xcite and wegner @xcite .",
    "it is convenient to define the rum dimension to be the dimension of this algebraic variety .",
    "( see section 5 . ) in 3d it takes the values @xmath9 .",
    "the following simple example will serve well to illustrate the notation scheme for general crystal frameworks in @xmath4 dimensions that we adopt .",
    "the example is also of interest in its own right , as we see later .",
    "figure 1 indicates a translationally periodic bar - joint framework @xmath10 determined by a sequence @xmath11 in @xmath12 .",
    "the framework edges @xmath13 $ ] , associated with the edges of the underlying graph @xmath14 , are viewed as inextensible bars connected at the framework vertices @xmath15 but otherwise unconstrained .",
    "let the scaling be such that @xmath16 are three framework vertices of a triangular subframework .",
    "write their translates as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the isometry @xmath19 od @xmath12 .",
    "the translation group @xmath20 is also used to define a natural periodic labelling of the framework edges : @xmath21,~~ e_2=e_{2,0}=[p_2,p_3 ] , ~~e_3=e_{3,0}=[p_1,p_3,],\\ ] ]",
    "@xmath22 , ~~e_5= e_{5,0}=[p_{3,0 } , p_{2,1}]\\ ] ] and @xmath23 thus , the pair of finite sets @xmath24 have disjoint translates under @xmath25 and the set of all such translates determines @xmath5 .    in an exactly similar way a translationally periodic bar - joint framework @xmath5 in @xmath3",
    "is determined by a triple @xmath26 where we refer to the finite set pair @xmath27 as a _ motif _ for @xmath5 .",
    "of particular interest for applications are the cases @xmath28 in which @xmath29 and @xmath25 has full rank . for @xmath30 `` full rank ''",
    "means that the so - called _ period vectors _",
    "@xmath31 are linearly independent , in which case the framework vertices , if they are distinct , form a discrete set in @xmath6 .",
    "we call such discrete bar - joint frameworks _ crystal frameworks_.    we now introduce a key dynamical ingredient , namely the notion of an",
    "_ infinitesimal flex_. this definition is the same as that for finite bar - joint frameworks being a specification of velocity vectors at the nodes which , to first order , do not change edge lengths .",
    "let @xmath5 be crystal framework , with framework vertices @xmath32 as above .",
    "an infinitesimal flex of @xmath5 is a set of vectors @xmath33 ( velocity vectors ) such that for each edge @xmath34 $ ] @xmath35    the linear equations required for an infinitesimal flex @xmath36 translate to a single equation @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the so called _ rigidity matrix _ for the framework and where @xmath39 is a vector in the direct product vector space @xmath40 , regarded as a composite vector of instantaneous velocities .",
    "the rigidity matrix is sparse with rows labelled by edges and columns labelled by the euclidean coordinate labels @xmath41 of the framework vertices , with @xmath42 ; the row for framework edge @xmath43 $ ] has the entry @xmath44 for column @xmath45 , and has the negative of this entry for column @xmath46 .",

    "the entries are scalar - valued functions on the @xmath4-torus of points @xmath56 in @xmath57 with @xmath58 .",
    "we define this matrix function below in definition [ d : phi2 ] and one can check that the strip framework of figure 1 has associated matrix function @xmath59.\\ ] ]      the next three frameworks are based on some simple two - dimensional tessellations that are suggested by tilings found in seville cathedral ( figures 2 and 3 ) and in the alcazaar in seville ( figure 4 ) .",
    "all three are in maxwell counting equilibrium in the sense that the average coordination number ( average vertex degree ) is @xmath60 , matching the degree of freedom of each vertex , while each subframework is not `` overconstrained '' , in the sense that the number of edges does not exceed twice the number of vertices .",
    "a motif for the framework @xmath61 is shown in figure 3 together with the period vectors ( dotted ) .",
    "the motif edges consist of a square of edges together with two vertical edges whose ( equal ) lengths fix the geometry up to a global scaling .",
    "( the `` rigid units '' of this framework are the single vertex subframeworks . )",
    "note that there is an evident ( edge - length preserving ) continuous flex , or deformation , @xmath62 of @xmath61 which is associated with an expansion in the @xmath63 direction and a matching contraction in the @xmath64 direction .",
    "we remark that in the case of the geometry with all edge lengths equal this deformation passes through the framework composed of congruent rhombs which is reciprocal ( in the lattice sense @xcite ) to the well - known kagome framework , indicated in section 5.1 . from the first instant of the deformation , so to speak , one obtains an infinitesimal flex @xmath65 which ( unlike infinitesimal translation flexes ) is unbounded .",
    "less evident are various nontrivial bounded infinitesimal flexes , but we see below that there are plenty of these and that the rum dimension is @xmath66 .",
    ".,width=264 ]    the framework @xmath67 in figure 3 has triangular rigid units and a local ( finitely supported ) infinitesimal flex is indicated , with four nonzero velocity vector components .",
    "it is a general principle , as we note further below , that such a local phenomenon makes the framework maximally flexible from a rum point of view .    , with a local infinitesimal flex.,width=264 ]",
    "the planar graph , or `` topology '' of this framework is rather interesting , being a network of @xmath68-rings of triangles connected `` square - wise '' , so that the `` holes '' are @xmath69-cycles and @xmath68-cycles .",
    "one can make similar constructions with equilateral triangles with this topology although now the local infinitesimal flex is lost .",
    "we remark that periodic networks of pairwise corner - joined congruent equilateral triangles provide the 2d variants of the tetrahedral nets associated with zeolites .",
    "( that the hole cycles of 2d zeolites can be arbitrarily large follows from the substitution move which replaces each rigid unit triangle by a @xmath70-ring of smaller triangles with edge length halved . )    , a homeomorph of @xmath71.,width=264 ]    the framework @xmath72 is derived from a tiling in the alcazaar in seville .",
    "a moment s thought reveals it to have the same topology ( underlying graph ) as that for the basic square grid framework @xmath71 .",
    "the infinitesimal flexibility is less evident than is the case for @xmath71 but from the rum viewpoint they turn out to be equally flexible with rum dimension @xmath66 .",
    "informally , a `` linkage '' is a bar - joint framework with one degree of essential flexibility . in 1784",
    "james watt designed a bar - joint linkage which transformed circular motion into approximate linear motion .",
    "this was rather important for steam engine transmission .",
    "the mechanism was approximate and was superseded by peaucellier s exact linear motion linkage eighty years later . in 1876",
    "kempe @xcite solved the general inverse problem by showing that any finite algebraic curve can be simulated by a linkage .",
    "the rigidity of geometric frameworks was also of interest to euler and to cauchy who in particular were concerned with the rigidity of polyhedra with hinged faces ; a beautiful classical result is the infinitesimal rigidity of all convex triangle - faced polyhedra .",
    "james clerk maxwell initiated combinatorial aspects with the observation that a graph @xmath73 with a minimally rigid generic framework realisation in the plane must satisfy the simple counting rule @xmath74 together with the inequalities @xmath75 for all subgraphs .",
    "the number @xmath70 represents the number of independent global infinitesimal motions for the plane . in 1970",
    "laman @xcite obtained the fundamental result that maxwell s conditions are sufficient for generic rigidity and this result also anticipated the advent of matroid theory in rigidity theory . while corresponding counting rules are necessary in three dimensions they fail to be sufficient and no necessary and sufficient combinatorial conditions for generic rigidity are known ! for further information see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "laman s theorem concerns _ generic _ frameworks with a particular graph .",
    "one can expect that special frameworks with global symmetries may have more flexibility and this is a topic of current interest .",
    "see for example , connelley et al @xcite , owen and power @xcite and shulze @xcite , @xcite .",
    "understanding constraint systems of geometric objects with symmetry present is also of significance for algorithms for cad software @xcite .",
    "laman s theorem is also concerned with _",
    "finite _ frameworks .",
    "a natural generalisation , also of significance for applications , are periodic frameworks in the sense of the crystal frameworks above .",
    "see also whiteley @xcite , borcea and streinu @xcite , malestein and theran @xcite , and ross , schulze and whiteley @xcite .",
    "the theory of general infinite bar - joint frameworks , from the point of view of rigidity , is a novel topic and perhaps a rather curious one .",
    "we point out in owen and power @xcite,@xcite that it is possible to generalise kempe s theorem to the effect that any _ continuous _ curve ( ie",

    "( in @xcite this is achieved with three vertices of infinite degree but in fact infinite degree vertices are not necessary . )    in material science the microporous flexing materials known as zeolites are on the one hand important for industrial applications , as filters , and on the other hand present diverse tetrahedral rigid unit frameworks .",
