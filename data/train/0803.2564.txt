    "the nuclear shell model @xcite has been applied successfully for the description of various aspects of nuclear structure , in large part because it is based on a minimum number of assumptions .",
    "although direct diagonalization of the hamiltonian matrix in the full hilbert space would be desirable , the dimensionality of such a space is often too large to allow calculations of this type to be done .",
    "recently , in order to relax this restriction dramatically , various stochastic approaches , for instance , the shell - model monte carlo method @xcite , have been suggested .",
    "alternatively , algebraic models using the symmetry properties of the systems under investigation have been developed ( e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "intruder levels are present in heavy deformed nuclei where the strong spin - orbit interaction destroys the underlying harmonic oscillator symmetry of the nuclear mean - field potential .",
    "the role they play for the overall dynamics of the system has been the topic of many questions and debates @xcite . until now",
    ", the problem has been either approached within the framework of a truncation - free toy model @xcite or by just considering the role of the single intruder level detached from its like - parity partners @xcite .",
    "it was argued in @xcite that particles in these levels contribute in a complementary way to building the collectivity in nuclei .",
    "however , some mean - field theories suggest that these particles play the dominant role in inducing deformation @xcite . in order to build a complete shell - model theory ,",
    "these levels need to be included in the model space especially if experimentally observed high - spin or opposite - parity states are to be described .",
    "until recently , su(3 ) shell - model calculations - real su(3 ) @xcite for light nuclei and pseudo - su(3 ) @xcite for heavy nuclei - have been performed in either only one space ( protons and neutrons filling the same shell , e.g. the @xmath6 shell ) or two spaces ( protons and neutrons filling different shells , e.g. for rare - earth and actinide nuclei ) .",
    "various results for low - energy features , like energy spectra and electromagnetic transition strengths , have been published over the years @xcite .",
    "these applications confirm that the su(3 ) model works well for light nuclei and the pseudo - su(3 ) scheme , under an appropriate set of assumptions , for rare - earth and actinide species . up to now , su(3)-based methodologies have not been applied to nuclei with mass numbers @xmath7 to @xmath8 , which is an intermediate region where conventional wisdom suggests the break down of the assumptions that underpin their use in the other domains . in particular , the @xmath4 intruder level that penetrates down from the shell above due to",
    "the strong spin - orbit splitting appears to be as spectroscopically relevant to the overall dynamics as the normal - parity @xmath3 levels .",
    "specifically , in this region the effect of the intruder level can not be ignored or mimicked through a `` renormalization '' of the normal - parity dynamics which is how it has been handled to date .",
    "the upper-@xmath9 shell is the lightest region of nuclei where the intruder level must be taken into account .",
    "its presence poses a significant challenge and opens a sequence of questions , many of them still unanswered .",
    "for example , if the pseudo - su(3 ) symmetry proves to be a good scheme for characterizing upper-@xmath2 shell configurations , should one integrate the @xmath4 intruder into this picture by treating it as a single @xmath10-shell that is independent of couplings to the other members ( @xmath11 ) of the @xmath5 shell , or should one take the complete @xmath5 shell into account ? while the treatment of the @xmath4 intruder as a single additional orbit is possible for only a few exceptional nuclei within the m - scheme shell - model calculations , an su(3 ) approach to the problem could allow the inclusion of the @xmath4 intruder as a member of the full gds shell and can be applied to all upper - fp nuclei .",
    "it is the purpose of this work to introduce and establish the benefits of a new and extended su(3 ) shell model which , for the first time , explicitly includes particles from the complete unique - parity sector and therefore can be used to explore the role that intruder levels play in the dynamics of the system .",
    "calculations are performed for two nuclei which are of major importance in astrophysics , namely , the waiting - point @xmath12 nuclei @xmath0ge and @xmath1se @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xmath1se is known to be among the nuclei for which shape coexistence effects have been reported @xcite .",
    "both the strengths and the limitations of the model are demonstrated and discussed .",
    "first , a motivation for our approach is presented and the appropriate choice of model space is established by calculating , using a realistic hamiltonian , the occupancies of the single - particle orbitals and the symmetry properties of these typical upper - fp shell nuclei .",
    "then , following a brief introduction of the basics of the extended su(3 ) model , calculations for the energy spectra , b(e2 ) transition strengths and the wave function content are performed and results are compared with the realistic predictions .",
    "finally , discussion about various future applications of the model is included .",
    "to benchmark the benefit of the su(3 ) scheme in this region ( pseudo - su(3 ) for the upper-@xmath2 shell and normal su(3 ) for the @xmath4 configurations extended to the full @xmath5 shell ) , we first generated results in a standard m - scheme representation for both nuclei , @xmath0ge and @xmath1se , with the 8 ( 4 protons + 4 neutrons ) and 12 ( 6 protons + 6 neutrons ) valence nucleons , respectively , distributed across the @xmath13 model space with the @xmath14 level considered to be fully occupied and part of a @xmath15ni core .",
    "the hamiltonian we used is a g - matrix with a phenomenologically adjusted monopole part @xcite that in many cases describes the experimental energies reasonably well .",
    "specifically , this upper-@xmath9 shell interaction was succesfully used in the past to obtain quite good results for nuclei like @xmath16ga @xcite , and @xmath17ge and @xmath18se @xcite .",
    "later , it was applied for exploring the pseudo - su(4 ) symmetry in the region from the beginning of the upper fp - shell up to @xmath19 and for describing beta decays @xcite .",

    "[ figure_occupancies ] , a comparison is made between the occupancies for @xmath0ge as determined in a restricted basis , where at most two particles ( protons / neutrons ) are allowed in the @xmath4 level and the full - space resuls .",
    "the upper ( yellow ) bars show the contribution to occupations from basis states with an occupied intruder level while the lower ( blue ) portion represents those where the intruder level is empty .",
    "the calculated results suggest that the occupancy probability for the intruder level is approximately 0.3 particles for the low - lying states of @xmath0ge .",
    "calculations with no particles allowed in the intruder level or with just one identical - particle ( or proton - neutron ) pair ( fig . [ figure_occupancies ]",
    "( a ) and ( b ) ) can not describe either its occupancy or the gradual change in the occupancy of the single - particle levels in the ground - state ( g.s . )",
    "band that is found in the full - model - space results .",
    "however , using a restricted space with at most two identical particles occupying the intruder level ( in fig .",
    "[ figure_occupancies](e ) ) is sufficient to describe both features as well as the low - energy spectrum and the b(e2 ) transition strengths @xcite .",
    "similar results were observed for the @xmath20 band of this nucleus . as expected , calculations for @xmath1se performed in a truncated basis with at most 2 nucleons allowed in the intruder level produce a slighlty higher value of the @xmath4 occupancy compared to @xmath0ge .",
    "next , the goodness of the pseudo - su(3 ) symmetry in these nuclei was tested using a renormalized version of the same realistic interaction in the @xmath21 space @xcite .",
    "the matrix of the second - order casimir operator of pseudo - su(3 ) , @xmath22 , was generated and the method of moments @xcite used to diagonalize this matrix by starting the lanzcos procedure with specific eigenvectors of the hamiltonian for which a pseudo - su(3 ) decomposition was desired .",
    "although the procedure provides distributions only over the @xmath23 values ( and not over the actual @xmath24 irreducible representations ( irreps ) ) this analysis is quite useful and gives valuable information about the structure of certain eigenstates .    the distribution of the second order casimir operator @xmath25 of pseudo - su(3 ) yields contributions of about 50 - 60% from the leading pseudo - su(3 ) irrep in the g.s .",

    "[ figure_symmetry](a ) ) which suggests that the pseudo - su(3 ) symmetry is quite good . in the @xmath20 band",
    "[ figure_symmetry ] ( b ) and ( c ) ) this contribution appears to be somewhat lower , ranging from approximately 37% for the @xmath26 state to about 62% in the @xmath27 state .",
    "the analysis also reveals that using only five irreps which have the highest @xmath23 value one may take account of at least 70% and up to about 95% of the wavefunction for the states in these bands .",
    "in the case of @xmath1se , the outcome turns out to be quite similar for the states from the g.s .",
    "band ( fig .",
    "[ figure_symmetry](d ) ) .",
    "although the irreps with the maximal value of @xmath28 participate with only between about 40% and 50% , the first eleven irreps with distinct values of @xmath29 and @xmath30 account for 88 - 93% of the wavefunction .",
    "in addition , the @xmath31 state at 2.51 mev is also dominated ( @xmath32 ) by irreps with the biggest @xmath23 value .",
    "however , other states are predicted to be highly - mixed su(3 ) configurations .",
    "this includes the @xmath33 state found at 1.05 mev - a value very similar to the ones reported in @xcite for a low - lying state of prolate shape . a recent analysis reveales that many low - lying states in other @xmath34 nuclei also have good pseudo - su(3 ) symmetry which further underscores the value of using symmetry - based truncation schemes @xcite .    in summary",
    ", the outcome of the m - scheme study has demonsrtated that only part of the configurations are relevant for the structure of the low - lying states in the upper - fp shell nuclei .",
    "this along with the pseudo - su(3 ) spectral decomposition of the states establishes the validity of a su(3)-based truncation scheme in @xmath35 upper - fp shell nuclei . as for the unique - parity spaces , the so - called quasi - su(3 ) concept @xcite may also be applicable , however",
    ", this question is deferred to a follow - on investigation . since ( as we will see below )",
    "the role of the unique - parity spaces for the nuclei we deal with , is to introduce only some high - order effects , it is relatively safe to accept this to be true throughout the current work .",
    "following the series of arguments and motivations presented in the previous section , we can now introduce the basics of the extended su(3 ) shell model . like its early precursors",
    "@xcite , it is also a microscopic theory in the sense that both su(3 ) generators - the angular momentum ( @xmath36 ) and quadrupole ( @xmath37 ) operators - are given in terms of individual nucleon coordinate and momentum variables .",
    "however , the model space has a more complicated structure than the one used in earlier models based on the su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "specifically , it consists of two parts for each particle type , a normal ( n ) parity pseudo - shell ( @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath40 ) and a unique ( or abnormal ) ( u ) parity shell composed of all levels of opposite parity from the @xmath5 shell above .",

    "the colons in the quadrupole operator notation represent normal - ordered operator since all the one - body effects have already been taken into account by the single - particle terms in the hamiltonian .",

    "more significant deviations are observed for the transitions between members of the @xmath20 band and the @xmath114 transitions in @xmath0ge .",
    "these could be attributed to the fact that some of the states from this band ( e.g. @xmath115 and @xmath116 ) are found to be highly mixed with @xmath117 irreps and differ more significantly from the rest thus displaying a less regular structure pattern throughout the band , for example , to what has been observed in the same bands of some rare - earth nuclei .",
    "it seems that the orbit - orbit interaction is the part of the hamiltonian responsible for this feature .",
    "results when only the normal - parity spaces are included in the calculation ( shown in parentheses ) reveal a contribution of the unique - parity sector of only up to 2 - 3% .",
    "an increase in this number is expected for higher - lying states or heavier nuclei where the dominant configurations are the ones with an occupied unique - parity space .",
    "finally , let us look at the content of the eigenfunctions for the states in the different bands . in the g.s .",

[ figure_wf_content](a ) ) which gradually declines throughout the band from about 80% for @xmath120 to less than 40% for @xmath121 . since the spin - orbit interaction is not as strong as in the case of the ds - shell nuclei , the mixing of irreps is smaller compared to the corresponding normal - su(3 ) results for @xmath122 mg and @xmath123si @xcite . on the other hand , as mentioned above , the @xmath20 band follows a less regular pattern with some of the states being of highly mixed nature .",
    "the @xmath33 state is found to be dominated ( 85% ) by the @xmath124 irrep . in the case of @xmath1se ,",
    "the leading irrep @xmath125 contributes from 75 to 85% ( fig . [",
    "figure_wf_content](b ) ) .",
    "a slight change in the type of hamiltonian used may help establish the transition from states of prolate shape dominated by the irrep ( 12,0 ) in the g.s .",
    "band to ones where the ( 0,12 ) irrep prevails . to achieve this effect we need to add a term proportional to the third order casimir invariant @xmath126 of su(3 ) .",
    "it was demostrated earlier @xcite that this term is capable of adjusting the prolate - oblate band crossing by driving irreps with @xmath127 lower in energy than those with @xmath128 . the same term",
    "can also be used to fix the position of the first excited @xmath129 state not assigned yet experimentally but predicted by our g - matrix calculations to lie at 1.05 mev .",
    "although the extended - su(3 ) calculations are performed in a model space that involves the whole gds shell , the basis is still much smaller in size even compared with the one used for realistic calculations in the @xmath77 space .",
    "this drastic reduction translates into the use of only hundreds or at most a few thousand basis states ( table [ table_spaces ] ) .",
    "for example , the size of the basis used in the extended - su(3 ) calculations for @xmath0ge represents only between 0.02% to 0.3% of that for unrestricted calculations in the @xmath77 model space .",
    "this means that a space spanned by a set of extended - su(3 ) basis states may be computationally manageable beyond the limit accessible for the modern full - space shell - model calculations as is the case for the combination of the upper - fp and the gds shells .    while some refinements in the model certainly could be done ( like trying different and more sophisticated types of hamiltonians , using different strengths for identical - particle and pn - pairing interactions , etc . ) and the role of the model - space truncation may be further explored , the results presented in this paper suffice to demonstrate that the su(3 ) scheme in its extended formulation can be a valuable tool for studying nuclei of the upper - fp - shell region .",
    "its benefits will show even more prominently in the more general and complicated case , namely , when the dominant configuration is no longer the one with an empty unique - parity space and in situations when two or more competing configurations are closer to one another in energy and as a consequence experience strong mixing .",
    "in this paper we extended the usual pseudo - su(3 ) shell model for upper - fp shell nuclei in two ways : firstly by integrating the g@xmath130 level into the dynamics ; and secondly by including the entire gds - shell organized via its su(3 ) structure , which we dubbed the extended su(3 ) shell model .",
    "while this work only deals with the simplest case in which one configuration ( the one with no particles in the unique - parity space ) dominates all others , it is still possible to appreciate the strength of this new approach .",
    "specifically , the model offers a richer model space compared to the previous su(3 ) schemes by taking particles from the unique - parity space explicitly into account . as a result",
    ", the current approach presents an opportunity for a better description of the collectivity properties of the systems considered by reducing the effective charge needed in the description of their b(e2 ) transition strengths .",
    "these results will be even more pronounced for heavier systems where the intruder space is expected to have higher occupancy .",
    "this approach also offers an opportunity to explore the role of the intruder levels in the dynamics of the system as in the current study they are treated on the same footing as the normal - parity orbitals .",
    "it is important to underscore that these advantages are accomplished within a highly truncated and symmetry - adapted basis , which possibly allows one to reach into otherwise computationally challenging ( if not inaccessible ) domains .",
    "the results for the nuclei @xmath0ge and @xmath1se , presented in this paper , demonstrate a close reproduction of various results obtained with a realistic interation .",
    "specifically , many of the states in the energy spectra and the b(e2 ) transition strengths are nicely reproduced . while the results are satisfactory for the states from the g.s .",
    "bands , there still seem to be some need for a more precise description of the nuclear characteristics related to the properties of the eigenfunctions . these could be addressed in the future by including some corrections with the use of more elaborated interactions .",
    "nevertheless , the results certainly suggest that the extended su(3 ) model can be a valuable tool in studying properties of nuclei of special interest from this region , such as those lying close to the proton drip line or / and actively participating in the processes of nucleosynthesys .",
    "they also point to an excellent opportunity to reveal the role the intruder levels play in the dynamics of the system in an exciting and completely new way , namely , considering their connection to their like - parity partners within the framework of a severely - truncated symmetry - adapted model space .",
    "an extension of the su(3 ) shell model for the rare - earth and actinide nuclei is also underway .",
    "it will be able to provide some valuable new information and a better understanding of the fragmentation and clusterization phenomena in the b(m1 ) transition strengths .",
    "also , it will signifficantly reduce the values of the effective charges used in estimates of the b(e2 ) transition strengths .",
    "in addition , an expected new emerging structure of the states in the excited @xmath118 bands could give an explanation for the enhanced b(e2 ) transition strengths to members of the g.s .",
    "finally , the new model provides a powerful means of explanation for the abundance of low - lying @xmath118 states found experimentally .",

    "<S> an extended su(3 ) shell model that for the first time explicitly includes unique - parity levels is introduced . </S>",
    "<S> shell - model calculations for the isotopes of @xmath0ge and @xmath1se are performed where valence nucleons beyond the n=28=z core occupy levels of the normal parity upper-@xmath2 shell ( @xmath3 ) and the unique parity @xmath4 intruder configuration . </S>",
    "<S> the levels of the upper-@xmath2 shell are handled within the framework of an m - scheme basis as well as its pseudo - su(3 ) counterpart , and respectively , the @xmath4 as a single level and as a member for the complete @xmath5 shell . </S>",
    "<S> it is demonstrated that the extended su(3 ) approach allows one to better probe the effects of deformation and to account for many key properties of the system by using a highly truncated model space . </S>"
