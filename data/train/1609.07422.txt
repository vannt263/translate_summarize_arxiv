    "heavy quark production processes provide a powerful insight into our understanding of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . the study of heavy mesons properties is also a subject of interest for understanding of quark - gluon interaction dynamics .",
    "generally , two mechanisms are investigated for the production of heavy mesons : recombination and fragmentation @xcite . in the first scheme ,",
    "heavy mesons are formed from heavy - heavy or heavy - light quarks which are produced independently in hard subprocesses . in the second mechanism",
    ", the fragmentation refers to the process of a parton which carries large transverse momentum and subsequently forms a jet containing the expected hadron @xcite . at sufficiently large transverse momentum of the heavy meson production , the direct leading - order production scheme ( recombination mechanism )",
    "is normally suppressed while the fragmentation scheme becomes dominant , though it is formally of higher order in the strong coupling constant @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "+ the fragmentation mechanism is described by the function @xmath2 which refers to the probability for a parton @xmath3 at the factorization scale @xmath4 to fragment into a hadron @xmath5 carrying away a fraction @xmath6 of its momentum @xcite .",
    "the fragmentation functions ( ffs ) are key quantities to calculate hadroproduction cross sections and their specific importance is for their model - independent predictions of the cross sections at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) . in this respect , one needs to determine these functions with high accuracy as possible .",
    "+ basically , there are two approaches to determine the ffs where one calculates these functions in the initial scale of fragmentation and then can evolve them to higher scales using the dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ( dglap ) renormalization group equations @xcite . in the first approach ( _ phenomenological _ approach ) the free parameters in the proposed forms of the ffs are extracted form experimental data analysis . since the hadronization mechanism is universal and independent of the perturbative processes which produce the partons one can exploit , for example , the existing data on @xmath7 events to fit the proposed models for the @xmath8 transition . in @xcite , considering a power model for the ffs we determined the @xmath9 ffs , both at lo and nlo , through a global fit to the single - inclusive @xmath10 annihilation data and the semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering asymmetry data from hermes and compass .",
    "this phenomenological approach is frequently used to obtain the nonperturbative ffs .",
    "the ffs are related to the low - energy part of the hadroproduction processes but , fortunately , it was found that these functions for heavy hadron productions are analytically calculable by virtue of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) with limited phenomenological parameters @xcite .",
    "an alternative fragmentation model which does contain spin information has been proposed by suzuki @xcite . in this approach",
    ", suzuki calculates the heavy ffs using the same feynman diagrams , as in the pqcd approach , for the parton level of the process and also by considering the wave function of heavy meson which contains the bound state nonperturbative dynamic of produced meson . in the suzuki s model ,",
    "the analytical expression of ffs depends on the transverse momentum @xmath11 of the initial parton , while in the pqcd scheme one integrates over the invariant mass of the fragmenting quark .",
    "the invariant mass is related to the transverse momentum @xmath11 of the meson relative to the fragmenting quark @xcite .",
    "in fact , rather than integrating over @xmath12 , the suzuki s model chooses to evaluate the integrand at a typical value @xmath13 , see ( [ ayda2 ] ) . in @xcite , using the suzuki s model we calculated the initial scale fragmentation function for @xmath14-quark to split into s - wave @xmath15-mesons at leading - order of perturbative qcd . here",
    ", we review the suzuki s formalism at lo and detail the extension of this formalism at nlo by considering the real and virtual gluon radiative corrections .",
    "finally we will present , for the first time , our nlo analytical expression of the heavy quark ff in the suzuki s model and compare our result with the lo one @xcite . to show the importance of our calculations we will also compare both results with experimental data from belle @xcite and cleo @xcite .",
    "we also compare our analytical results with a well - known phenomenological model .",
    "as will be shown , the nlo corrections improve our theoretical results at lo and make good agreement with experimental data .",
    "the theoretical approaches to calculate the heavy quark ffs depend on the fact that the ffs for hadrons containing heavy quarks can be calculated theoretically using the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) @xcite .",
    "the first theoretical effort to illustrate the production procedure of hadrons containing heavy quarks was established by bjorken @xcite . in a naive quark - parton model",
    ", he deduced that the inclusive distribution of heavy mesons should peak almost at @xmath16 , where @xmath17 refers to the longitudinal momentum fraction of the hadron state .",
    "the pqcd scheme was followed by suzuki @xcite , ji and amiri @xcite by considering more elaborate models . while in this approach suzuki computes the heavy ffs by applying a feynman diagram similar to that in fig .",
    "[ lo ] , amiri and ji calculate their ffs in @xmath10 annihilation process in the same order of pqcd . in their models",
    "the total amplitude for the fragmentation of a heavy quark into a heavy meson is obtained by perturbative calculations of quark - gluon non - abelian interaction up to the order of @xmath18 and use of a delta function to represent the s - wave heavy meson bound state .",
    "in fact , they consider a heavy bound state as a nonrelativistic system and reduce its wave function to a delta function @xcite .     the lowest order feynman diagram contributing to the fragmentation of a heavy quark q into a heavy meson @xmath19 . ]",

    "are also labeled . ]",
    "the suzuki s model includes most of the kinematical and dynamical properties of the splitting process and gives us a detailed insight about the fragmentation process . specifically ,",
    "if we want to know about further details such as the spin property of fragmentation , this model can be instructive .",
    "briefly , the suzuki s model is a dynamical model which is more predictive and describes spin - dependent effects and also includes the kinematical details of the fragmentation process .",
    "it mixes a perturbative picture with nonperturbative dynamics of fragmentation and not only predicts the z - dependence of the ffs , but also their dependence on @xmath11 , the transverse momentum of the meson relative to the jet .",
    "+ in @xcite , using the suzuki s model we derived an analytical expression for the heavy quark ff at lowest order ( @xmath18-order ) of pqcd by considering the typical feynman diagram shown in fig .  [ lo ] , where a heavy quark q creates a bound state @xmath19 along with a light quark @xmath22 through a single gluon .",
    "the result for the fragmentation function @xmath23 was dependent on the transverse momentum @xmath11 of the initial heavy quark . here , we present a compacted expression of our previous result as @xmath24\\left\\langle k_t^{2}\\right\\rangle+m_qm_q\\big[m_q-(1-z)m_q\\big]\\bigg ) \\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\big[\\left\\langle k_t^{2}\\right\\rangle+m_q^2\\big]\\big[\\left\\langle k_t^{2}\\right\\rangle+m_q^2\\big]\\frac{m_qz^4}{m_q}\\bigg\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath25 ^ 2\\times \\bigg[z^2 \\left\\langle k_t^{2}\\right\\rangle+(m(z-1)-zm_q)^2\\bigg]^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath26 , but the coefficient b is related to the normalization condition @xmath27 @xcite . in computing eq .",

    "in fact , hadron mass modifies the relations between partonic and hadronic variables and is responsible for the low-@xmath17 threshold , although this additional effect is not expected to be truly sizable numerically , its study is nevertheless necessary in order to fully exploit the enormous statistics of the lhc data .    in the present work we derive an analytical form of the transverse momentum dependent heavy quark ff at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) with assumption of a delta function for the meson bound state , as in @xcite .",
    "the underlying link between hadronic phenomena in qcd at large and small distances is the hadronic wave function .",

    "in fact , in the suzuki s model a meson is replaced by collinear constituents with neglecting the fermi motion and the nonperturbative aspect of the hadroproduction is included in the wave function of the heavy meson bound state .",

    "in fact , it is just a matter by definition and notation . as long as one is consistent , both definitions are possible : according to the definition",
    ", one can say that the experimental data are a differential cross section or a fragmentation function .",
    "similar issues hold for structure functions and parton distribution functions . in practice , it is also possible to show that both definitions are consistent at lo and at higher - orders they are equal approximately . according to the second definition , the cross section for @xmath10 annihilation can be expressed as in ( [ monaa ] ) .",

    "besides the @xmath184 ffs themselves , also their first moment is of phenomenological interest and subject to experimental determination .",
    "it corresponds to the average fraction of energy that the @xmath185-mesons receive from the @xmath177 quark , @xmath186 where the cut @xmath187 excludes the problematic @xmath17 range where the formalism is not valid . on the other hand , as may be seen from fig .",

    "the dominant mechanism to produce hadronic bound states with large transverse momentum is fragmentation , that is the splitting of a high - energy parton into a hadronic state and other partons .",
    "it is tempting to use the heavy - quark limits of the perturbative qcd fragmentation functions as phenomenological models for the fragmentation of a heavy quark q into heavy - light mesons @xmath33 , where @xmath193 or @xmath62 and @xmath194 , or @xmath153 . in this work , using the suzuki s model we studied the perturbative qcd fragmentation functions for a heavy quark to fragment into s - wave heavy - light mesons in the heavy - quark limit at nlo . in this model , the nonperturbative aspect of the hadroproduction processes",
    "is emerged in the bound state of the meson which is described by the wave function .",
    "our result describes not only the @xmath6 dependence of the fragmentation probabilities , but also their dependence on the transverse momentum of the initial parton . as a numerical example",
    ", we studied the initial ffs of c - quark to split into s - wave @xmath195-mesons to leading order in @xmath1 and next - to - leading order .",
    "specifically , we compared the lo and nlo ffs for @xmath195-mesons with available @xmath112 annihilation data from belle @xcite and cleo @xcite and we found good agreement between the nlo result and experimental data .",
    "our results are also compared with a well - known phenomenological model ( bowler model @xcite ) for the heavy - quark fragmentation and found reliable consistency .",

    ", one needs to consider many real gluon feynman diagrams including the gluon , light and heavy quark propagators .",
    "normally , we expect that the nnlo corrections would increase the ff at @xmath17-large and decrease then at @xmath17-low to make a better fit with the data , as we had for the nlo effect , see figs .",
