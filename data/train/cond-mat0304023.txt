    "the classification of universality classes of second order phase transitions is still one of the most important uncompleted task of statistical physics .",
    "recently phase transitions of genuine nonequilibrium systems have intensively been investigated among reaction - diffusion ( rd ) type of models exhibiting absorbing states @xcite .",
    "there has been a hope that in such homogeneous systems symmetries and spatial dimensions are the most significant factors like in equilibrium ones , but gradually it turned out that there may be more relevant constituents as well .",
    "the most well known example is the parity conserving class ( pc ) , which differs from the robust universality class of directed percolation ( dp ) .",
    "the dp hypothesis stated by janssen and grassberger @xcite , according to which _ in one component systems exhibiting continuous phase transitions to single absorbing state ( without extra symmetry and inhomogeneity or disorder ) short ranged interactions can generate dp class transition only_. however parity conservation itself proved to be an insufficient condition in many cases @xcite and rather an underlying @xmath6 , @xmath7 ( barw2 ) process @xcite of particles and the @xmath8 symmetry of absorbing states is necessary for this class @xcite . on the other hand parity conservation in n - component branching and annihilating random",
    "walk ( n - barw ) systems @xcite , or by triplet production models @xcite was found to be responsible for novel classes again .",
    "in one dimensional , multi - component reaction - diffusion systems _ site restriction _ turned out to be a relevant , new factor @xcite . global conservation laws by directed percolation and lattice gas models were shown to be irrelevant @xcite , while systems with multiple absorbing states @xcite or with multi - components also exhibit dp class scaling behavior @xcite .",
    "an other important puzzle was being investigated intensively during the past three years that emerges at phase transitions of binary production reaction - diffusion systems @xcite ( pcpd ) . in these systems particle production by pairs competes with pair annihilation and single particle diffusion .",
    "if production wins steady states with finite particle density appear in ( site restricted ) , while in unrestricted ( bosonic ) models the density diverges . by lowering the production / annihilation rate",
    "a doublet of absorbing states without symmetries emerges .",
    "one of such states is completely empty , the other possesses a single wandering particle . in case of site restricted systems",
    "the transition to absorbing state is continuous .",
    "it is important to note that these models do not break the dp hypothesis , because they exhibit multiple absorbing states which are not frozen , lonely particle(s ) may diffuse in them .",
    "however _ no corresponding symmetry or conservation law has been found yet_. non - dp type of phase transition in a binary production system was already mentioned in the early work of grassberger @xcite . a corresponding bosonic field theoretical model the annihilation fission ( af ) process was introduced and studied by howard and tuber @xcite .",
    "these authors claim a non - dp type of transition in af , because the action does not contain linear mass term and the theory is non - renormalizible perturbatively unlike the reggeon field theory of dp . in field theories of models exhibiting dp class transition the canonical @xmath9 ,",
    "@xmath10 reactions are generated by the renormalization transformation unlike here .",
    "further facts opposing dp criticality are the set of different mean - field exponents and the different upper critical dimension of binary production pcpd like models ( @xmath11 vs. @xmath12)@xcite .",
    "forthcoming numerical studies reported somewhat different critical exponents , but there has been a consensus for about two years that this model should possess novel , non - dp type of transition .",
    "the first density matrix study by carlon et al .",
    "@xcite did not support a dp transition , but reported exponents near to those of the pc class . since the pcpd does not conserve the particle number modulo 2 , neither exhibits @xmath8 symmetric absorbing states the pc criticality was unfavored .",
    "simulation studies by hinrichsen @xcite and dor @xcite and coherent anomaly calculations by dor @xcite resulted in novel kind of critical behavior , although there was an uncertainty in the precise values of critical exponents .",
    "exponent estimates showed diffusion ( @xmath13 ) dependence that was under - pinned by pair mean - field results @xcite , possessing two distinct classes as the function of @xmath13 .",
    "recently park et al . reported well defined set of critical exponents in different versions of binary production pcpd - like processes @xcite .",
    "however these simulations were done at a fixed , high diffusion / annihilation rate and agree with dor s corresponding results @xcite .",
    "kockelkoren and chat on the other hand claim an other set of critical exponents @xcite that agrees with dor s low diffusion / annihilation data .    the pcpd model can be mapped onto a two - component model @xcite in which pairs are identified as a particle species following dp process and single particles as an other , coupled species following annihilating random walk .",
    "simulations of such a two - component system at @xmath14 showed a continuous phase transition with exponents agreeing with those of the pcpd for high diffusions .",
    "this model is similar to an other one @xcite , which exhibits global particle number conservation as well .",
    "field theory @xcite and simulations @xcite for the latter model reported two different universality classes as the function of @xmath13 .",
    "it would be interesting to see if this conservation law is relevant or not like in case of the dp @xcite .",
    "interestingly , higher level cluster mean - field approximations result in a single class behavior by varying @xmath13 and it turned out that by assuming logarithmic corrections the single class scenario can be supported by simulations too @xcite .",
    "the origin of such logarithmic corrections may be a marginal perturbation between pairs and single particles in a coupled system description .",
    "a filed theoretical explanation would be necessary .",
    "two more recent studies @xcite reported non - universality in the dynamical behavior of the pcpd .",
    "while in the former one dickman and menezes explored different sectors ( a reactive and a diffusive one ) in the time evolution and gave non - dp exponent estimates , in the latter one hinrichsen set afloat a speculative conjecture that the ultimate long time behavior might be characterized by dp scaling behavior . in a forthcoming preprint @xcite hinrichsen provided a discussion about the possibility of the dp transition based on a series of assumptions . his starting point is a langevin equation that is mapped onto a wetting process by cole - hopf transformation . by analyzing this process within a certain potential he gave arguments for a dp transition .",
    "while this langevin equation with real noise is valid for the bosonic version of pcpd at and above the critical point , its usage in case of site occupancy restricted models is hypothetic , the noise can be complex at the transition point and may even change sign by the transformation .",
    "furthermore the diffusive field of solitary particles is neglected .    in a very recent preprint @xcite",
    "barkema and carlon continue this line and show that some simulation and density matrix renormalization results may also be interpreted as a signal of a phase transition belonging to the dp class . by assuming correction to scaling exponents that are equal to dp exponents and relevant up to quadratic or 3-rd order in the asymptotic limit they fitted their numerical results in case of two independent exponents .",
    "the extrapolations resulted is close to dp values for @xmath14 .",
    "however for smaller @xmath13-s and by surface critical exponents this technique gave exponent estimates which are out of the error margin of dp .",
    "an other novel class that may appear in triplet production systems was proposed in @xcite ( tcpd ) .",
    "this reaction - diffusion model differs from the pcpd that for a new particle generation at least three particles have to meet . for such generalizations park et al .",
    "proposed a phenomenological langevin equation that exhibits real , multiplicative noise @xcite . by simple power counting",
    "they found that the triplet model exhibits distinct mean - field exponents and upper critical dimension @xmath15 .",
    "the simulations in 1d @xcite indeed showed non - trivial critical exponents , which do not seem to correspond to any known universality classes .",
    "kockelkoren and chat reported similar results in stochastic cellular automata ( sca ) versions of general @xmath16 , @xmath17 type of models @xcite , where multiple particle creation on a given site is suppressed by an exponentially decreasing creation probability ( @xmath18 ) of the particle number .",
    "they claim that their simulation results in 1d are in agreement with the fully occupation number restriction counterparts and set up a general table of universality classes , where as the function of @xmath19 and @xmath20 only 4 non - mean - field classes exist , namely the dp class , the pc class , the pcpd and tcpd classes",
    ". however more extensive simulations of 1 and 2 dimensional site restricted lattice models @xcite do not support some of these results in case of different triplet and quadruplet models . in the @xmath21 @xmath22 triplet model",
    "1d numerical data can be interpreted as mean - field behavior with logarithmic corrections and in two dimensions clear mean - field exponents appear , hence the upper critical dimension is @xmath23 , which contradicts the langevin equation prediction . surprisingly other non - trivial critical behavior were also detected in the @xmath24 @xmath25 parity conserving triplet model and in some quadruplet models @xcite .",
    "the cause of differences between the results of these studies is subject of further investigations .",
    "again proper field theoretical treatment would be important .",
    "the classification of universality classes of nonequilibrium systems by the exponent @xmath26 of a multiplicative noise in the langevin equation was suggested some time ago by grinstein et al .",
    "however it turned out that there may not be corresponding particle systems to real multiplicative noise cases @xcite and an imaginary part appears as well if one derives the langevin equation of a rd system starting from the master equation in a proper way .",
    "furthermore for higher - order processes the emerging nonlinearities in the master equation action do not allow a rewriting in terms of langevin - type stochastic equations of motion , hence for high - order processes like those of the tcpd a langevin representation may not exist .",
    "this situation resembles to some extent to a decade long debate over the critical phase transition of driven diffusive systems @xcite .",
    "the latest papers in this topic suggest that the phenomenological langevin equation originally set up for such systems do not correspond exactly to the lattice models investigated .",
    "simulations for different lattice models show , that instead of an external current the anisotropy is the real cause of the critical behavior observed in simulations @xcite .",
    "in this section i show that mean - field classes of site restricted lattice models with general microscopic processes of the form @xmath27 with @xmath0 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are different from those of the dp and pc processes backing numerical results which claim novel type of criticality below @xmath32 . the mean - field equation that can be set up for the lattice version of these processes ( with creation probability @xmath33 and annihilation or coagulation probability @xmath34 ) is @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes",
    "the site occupancy probability and @xmath37 is a dimension dependent coordination number .",
    "each empty site has a probability ( 1-@xmath36 ) in mean - field approximation , hence the need for @xmath38 empty sites at a creation brings in a @xmath39 probability factor . by expanding @xmath39 and keeping the lowest order contribution one can see that for site restricted lattice systems a @xmath40-th order term appears with negative coefficient that regulates eq.([mfeq ] ) in the active phase . in the inactive phase one",
    "expects a dynamical behavior dominated by the @xmath41 process , for which the particle density decay law is known @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "the steady state solutions were determined in @xcite analytically and one can distinguish three different situations at the phase transition : ( a ) @xmath43 , ( b ) @xmath44 and ( c ) @xmath45 .      as discussed in @xcite the leading order singularities of steady state solution can be obtained . by approaching the the critical point @xmath46 in the active phase",
    "the steady state density vanishes continuously as @xmath47 with the order parameter exponent exponent @xmath48 . at the critical point",
    "the density decays with a power - law @xmath49 with @xmath50 , hence @xmath51 , providing a series of mean - field universality classes for @xmath0 ( besides dp an pc where @xmath52 ) and backing the results , which claim novel type of non - trivial transitions below the critical dimension . unfortunately determining the the value of @xmath32 is a non - trivial task without a proper langevin equation .",
    "these scaling exponents can be obtained from bosonic , coarse grained formulation too @xcite , where a @xmath40-th order term , with negative coefficient had to be added by hand to suppress multiple site occupancy .",
    "it is known however that hard - core particle blocking may result in relevant perturbation in @xmath53 dimension @xcite , so for cases where the upper critical dimension is @xmath54 the site restricted , @xmath55 cluster mean - field approximation that takes into account diffusion would be a more adequate description of the model ( see @xcite ) .      in this case",
    "the mean - field solution provides first order transition ( see @xcite ) , hence it does not imply anything with respect to possible classes for models below the critical dimension ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "note however , that by higher order cluster mean - field approximations , where the diffusion plays a role the transition may turn into continuous one ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the simulations by kockelkoren and chat report dp class transition for such models in one dimension @xcite .      in this case",
    "the critical point is at zero branching rate @xmath57 , where the density decays with @xmath58 as in case of the @xmath59 branching and @xmath60 annihilating models showed by cardy and tuber @xcite ( bkarw classes ) .",
    "however the steady state solution for particle production with @xmath0 parents gives different @xmath61 exponents than those of bkarw classes , namely @xmath62 , defining a whole new series of mean - field classes @xcite , for a simplicity i shall call them pkarw classes .",
    "it is important to note , that one has not found a corresponding symmetry or conservation law to these classes .",
    "these mean - field classes imply novel kind of critical behavior for @xmath56 . for @xmath63 , @xmath64 the mean - field exponents are @xmath65 and @xmath66 agreeing with the mean - field exponents of the pcpd class . indeed for @xmath63 ,",
    "@xmath64 @xcite reports pcpd class dynamical criticality .",
    "this supports the expectation that non - mean - field classes follow the distinctions observed in the corresponding mean - field classes . to go further in sections [ 2dsimu ] and [ 1dsimu ]",
    "i investigate the phase transition of the simplest unexplored pkarw classes , in the @xmath63 , @xmath67 model",
    ".      in the mean - field approximation @xmath38 and @xmath68 do not affect the universal properties , however simulations in one dimension showed @xcite that in case of the @xmath69 model the critical point was shifted to zero branching rate and a bkarw class transition emerged there contrary to what was expected for @xmath43 .",
    "for a stochastic cellular automaton version of these reactions @xcite reported a non - trivial critical transition .",
    "in general one may expect such effects for large @xmath38 and @xmath68 values , for which n - cluster mean - field approximation  that takes into account diffusion  would give a better description .",
    "in the [ mfnmsect ] section i introduced pkarw mean - field classes for @xmath45 . here",
    "i explore the phase transition in the simplest model from this class , in the @xmath2 , @xmath3 model with @xmath14 diffusion rate .",
    "two dimensional simulations were performed on @xmath70 linear sized lattices with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "one monte carlo step ( mcs )  corresponding to @xmath71 ( where @xmath72 is the number of particles )  is built up from the following processes .",
    "a particle and a number @xmath73 are selected randomly ; if @xmath74 a site exchange is attempted with one of the randomly selected empty nearest neighbors ( nn ) ; if @xmath75 two particles are created with probability @xmath33 at randomly selected empty nn sites provided the number of nn particles was greater than or equal @xmath76 ; or if @xmath77 two particles are removed with probability @xmath78 .",
    "the simulations were started from fully occupied lattices and the particle density ( @xmath79 ) decay was followed up to @xmath80 mcs .",
    "first the critical point was located by measuring the dynamic behavior of @xmath79 .",
    "it turned out that the transition is at zero branching rate ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "the density decay was analyzed by the local slopes defined as @xmath81   \\over \\ln(m ) } \\label{slopes}\\ ] ] where i used @xmath67 .",
    "as fig.[2a4a ] shows the local slopes curve for @xmath82 mcs extrapolates to the mean - field value @xmath83 .",
    "this value agrees with the mean - field value @xmath84 .",
    "density decays for several @xmath33-s in the active phase ( @xmath85 ) were followed on logarithmic time scales and averaging was done over @xmath86 independent runs in a time window , which exceeds the level - off time by a decade .",
    "the steady state density in the active phase near the critical phase transition point is expected to scale as @xmath87    using the local slopes method one can get a precise estimate for @xmath61 as well as for the corrections to scaling @xmath88 as one can see on fig.[beta2a4a ] the effective exponent clearly tends to the expected mean - field value @xmath89 as @xmath90 . assuming a correction to scaling of the form @xmath91 non - linear fitting results in @xmath92 correction to scaling exponent .",
    "besides these scaling correction assumptions i also tried to apply different , lowest order logarithmic corrections to the data , but these fittings gave exponents slightly away from mean - field values and the corresponding coefficients proved to be very small , therefore i concluded that @xmath93 . in the next section i do the same analysis in @xmath53 .",
    "the simulations in one dimension were carried out on @xmath94 sized systems with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the initial states were again fully occupied lattices , and the density of particles is followed up to @xmath95 mcs .",
    "an elementary mcs consists of the following processes :    ( a ) : :    @xmath96 with probability d , ( b ) : :    @xmath97 with probability    @xmath98 , ( c ) : :    @xmath99 or    @xmath100 with probability    @xmath101 ,    the critical point was located at @xmath57 again .",
    "as one can see on figure [ 2a4a_5 ] there is a crossover of the local slopes for @xmath102 mcs and a linear extrapolation for this region results in @xmath103 agreeing with the mean - field value .",
    "the steady state data were analyzed in the active region for @xmath104 as in two dimensions , by the local slopes method ( eq . [ beff ] ) and by assuming correction to scaling of the form ( [ corsca ] ) .",
    "this resulted in @xmath105 correction to scaling exponent .",
    "the local slopes plotted as the function @xmath106 shown on fig .",
    "[ beta2a4a_5 ] extrapolates to @xmath107 in agreement with the mean - field exponent .",
    "in this paper i reviewed and discussed the state of the art of the phase transitions of reaction - diffusion systems exhibiting explicit diffusion and production by @xmath0 parents .",
    "arguments are given against dp criticality that has recently been suggested in some papers .",
    "these are supported by a series of mean - field classes that can be classified by the existence of a @xmath43 symmetry in the system and by the @xmath19 and @xmath20 values .",
    "especially the need for a proper field theoretical treatment is emphasized .",
    "the upper critical dimension in these models is not known .",
    "i determined by simulations the @xmath108 and @xmath61 exponents of the @xmath2 , @xmath3 model in one an two dimensions .",
    "these results indicate that for this binary production system the upper critical dimension is @xmath109 .",
    "this model conserves the parity of particles still its transition does not belong to the pc class .",
    "note that while the density decay results in one dimension are in agreement with that of kockelkoren and chat - s simulations @xcite , the off - critical order parameter exponent is @xmath62 which shows that there are more classes exist at zero branching rate besides the bkarw universality classes .",
    "it is still an open question if there is any variant of pkarw models that exhibits non - mean - field criticality in physical dimensions ( @xmath110 ) .      for references",
