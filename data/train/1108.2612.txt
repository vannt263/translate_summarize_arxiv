    "the search for a consistent quantum gravity is mainly being suffered from obtaining a renormalizable and unitary quantum field theory .",
    "stelle has first introduced curvature squared terms of @xmath9 in addition to the einstein - hilbert term of @xmath10  @xcite . if @xmath11 , the renormalizability was achieved , but the unitarity was violated unless @xmath12 .",
    "this clearly shows that the renormalizability and unitarity exclude to each other . in other words ,",
    "the renormalizability requires 8 dof ( 2 massless graviton , 5 massive graviton from @xmath13-term , and 1 massive scalar from @xmath14-term ) , whereas the unitarity imposes 3 dof ( 2 massless graviton and 1 massive scalar ) .",
    "although the @xmath13-term of providing massive graviton improves the ultraviolet divergence , it induces ghost excitations which jeopardize the unitarirty . in this sense ,",
    "a first test for the quantum gravity is to require the unitarity , which means that there are no tachyon and ghost in its particle contents .    to this end",
    ", we would like to comment that the critical gravities as candidates for quantum gravity were recently investigated in the ads spacetimes  @xcite . at the critical point",
    ", a degeneracy takes place and massive gravitons coincide with either massless gravitons ( @xmath15 ) or pure gauge modes ( @xmath16 ) . instead of massive gravitons ,",
    "an equal amount of logarithmic modes appears in the theory  @xcite : 1 dof for topologically massive gravity ( tmg )  @xcite , 2 dof for new massive gravity  @xcite , 5 dof for higher curvature gravity in 4d  @xcite . in general",
    ", we have @xmath17 dof for massive graviton .",
    "however , the non - unitarity issue of the log - gravity is not still resolved  @xcite , indicating that any log - gravity suffers from the ghost problem .",
    "furthermore , the critical gravity on the schwarzschild - ads black hole has suffered from the ghost problem when the cross term @xmath18 is non - vanishing  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we introduce a lorentz - violating theory of cherns - simons modified gravity  @xcite .",
    "a silent feature of this theory is the presence of a constant vector @xmath19 which spoils the isotropy of spacetime ( cpt - symmetry ) and is coupled to the pontryagin density of @xmath20 .",
    "motivation of considering cherns - simons modified gravity is twofold in minkowski spacetimes : one is its close connection to the tmg which accommodates a single massive graviton in three dimensions  @xcite and the other is the crucial dependence of massive graviton on a choice of constant vector @xmath19 .",
    "it was shown that a timelike vector of @xmath21 did not provide any massive mode , leaving massless graviton with 2 dof , while a spacelike vector @xmath22 yielded a massive graviton with 5 dof  @xcite .",
    "however , the authors  @xcite have shown that the only tachyon- and ghost - free model is the case of timelike vector @xmath21 , giving 2 dof .",
    "this implies that the role of chern - simons term is unclear to show its propagating dof .    here",
    "we wish to perform the perturbation analysis of the chern - simons modified gravity around the ads@xmath0 spacetimes to obtain the critical gravity , instead of minkowski spactimes . under the transverse and traceless gauge",
    ", we could not obtain a compactly third - order perturbed equation which shows a massive graviton with 5 dof , but for the kerr - schild perturbation with spacelike vector @xmath23 , we find the ads wave as a single massive graviton propagating on ads@xmath0 spacetimes .",
    "this was found as a solution to the einstein equation  @xcite .",
    "this ( 1 dof ) contrasts to propagating dof of graviton in minkowski spacetimes . at the critical point of @xmath24 ,",
    "the solutions takes the log - form and the linearized excitation energies vanish , which indicates a feature of critical gravity .",
    "let us first consider the chern - simons modified gravity in four dimensions with a cosmological constant ( @xmath25 ) whose action is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a diffeomorphism breaking parameter and it will be fixed by the equation of motion . therefore , it is hard to be considered as a lagrange multiplier . in the chern - simons",
    "modified maxwell theory , @xmath27 can be fixed as @xmath28 which yields the modified ampere s law  @xcite . at this stage , one may ask the question `` can we call any model without diffeomorphism as gravity ? '' . in order to answer it",
    ", we remind the feature of the gravitational chern - simons modified theory  @xcite . here",
    "the diffeomorphism breaking is being realized from the fact that the covariant divergence of the four - dimensional cotton tensor is non - zero [ see eq.([bian ] ) ] , in contrast to the case in three dimensions .",
    "therefore , a consistency condition on this theory is that @xmath29 for @xmath30 ( the theory reduces to the general relativity for @xmath31 because of @xmath32 ) . in this sense ,",

    "we introduce the perturbation around the the background metric as @xmath43 the linearized equation to ( [ equa1 ] ) can be written by @xmath44 where the linearized tensor @xmath45 and @xmath46 take the form @xmath47+\\bigg[a\\leftrightarrow b\\bigg]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath48 and @xmath49 . imposing the transverse and traceless ( tt ) gauge condition as @xmath50 which takes into account the diffeomorphism  @xcite",

    "reduces to the tmg when choosing the schwarzschild coordinates .",

    "however , it violates the allowed region of @xmath99 , @xmath100 for @xmath101 .",
