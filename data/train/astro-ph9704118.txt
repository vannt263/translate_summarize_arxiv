    "accurate modelling of the mechanical and thermal properties of very - low - mass stars ( vlms ) , or m - dwarfs , defined hereafter as objects with masses below @xmath50.8@xmath0 , is of prior importance for a wide range of physical and astrophysical reasons , from the understanding of fundamental problems in basic physics to astrophysical and cosmological implications .",
    "vlms are compact objects , with characteristic radii in the range @xmath6 .",
    "their central densities and temperatures are respectively of the order of @xmath7 g @xmath8 and @xmath9 k , so that correlation effects between the particles dominate the kinetic contribution in the interior stellar plasma .",
    "effective temperatures of vlms are below @xmath10 k , and surface gravities @xmath11 are in the range @xmath12 .",
    "these conditions show convincingly that the modelling of vlms requires a correct description of non - ideal effects in the equation of state ( eos ) and the nuclear reaction rates , and a derivation of accurate models for dense and cool atmospheres , where molecular opacity becomes eventually the main source of absorption . several ground - based and space - based ir missions are now probing the vlms wavelength range ( @xmath13 ) down to the end of the main - sequence ( ms ) , reaching sometimes the sub - stellar domain .",
    "these existing or future surveys will produce a substantial wealth of data , stressing the need for accurate theroretical models .",
    "indeed the ultimate goal of vlms theory is an accurate calibration of observations , temperature , luminosity and above all the mass , with the identification of genuine brown dwarfs . at last ,",
    "vlms represent the major component ( @xmath14 ) of the stellar population of the galaxy .",
    "a correct determination of the contribution of these objects to the galactic mass budget , both in the central parts and in the outermost halo , requires the derivation of reliable mass functions for vlms , and thus accurate theoretical _ mass - luminosity _ relationships for various metallicities .",
    "tremendous progress has been realized within the past decade in the field of vlms , both from the observational and theoretical viewpoints . from the theoretical point of view , the most recent benchmarks in the theory , without being exhaustive , have been made by dantona & mazzitelli ( 1985 , 1994 ) , who initiated the research in the field , the mit group ( dorman , nelson & chau 1989 ; nelson , rappaport & joss 1986 , 1993 ) and the tucson group ( lunine et al .",
    "1986 ; burrows , hubbard & lunine 1989 ; burrows et al . 1993 ) .",
    "so far , all these models , however , failed to reproduce the observations at the bottom of the vlms sequence , predicting substantially too large temperatures for a given luminosity ( see e.g. monet et al .",
    "this shortcoming of the theory made a reasonable identification of the observational h - r diagram elusive .",
    "such a discrepancy stemed from incorrect stellar radii ( and adiabatic gradients ) , a consequence of inaccurate eos , but most importantly from the use of _ grey _ atmosphere models .",
    "these points will be largely examined in  2.4 and  2.5 . a significant breakthrough in the structure and evolution of vlms",
    "was made recently by the tucson group , who first derived evolutionary models based on non - grey atmosphere models ( saumon et al .",
    "1994 ) , although for zero - metallicity , and by the lyon group ( baraffe et al .",
    "1995 , bcah95 ; 1997 , bcah97 ; chabrier et al .",
    "1996 ) who derived evolutionary models based on the allard - hauschildt ( 1995a , ah95 ; 1997 , ah97 ) non - grey model atmospheres for various finite metallicities .",
    "the bcah95 models were shown to improve significantly the afore - mentioned discrepancy at the bottom of the ms .",
    "these initial calculations have now been improved substantially .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to present a complete description of the physics entering the theory of vlms and to relate the properties of these objects to well understood physical grounds .",
    "extensive comparisons with available observations , color - magnitude diagrams and mass - magnitude relationships , will be presented in companion papers ( bcah97 ; allard et al .",
    "1997a ) .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in  2 , we describe the input physics which enters the present theory , eos , enhancement factors of the nuclear reaction rates , atmosphere models and boundary conditions .",
    "evolutionary models are presented in  3 , together with the prediction of the abundances of light elements ( @xmath15li,@xmath16be,@xmath17b ) along evolution and the burning minimum masses for these elements .",
    "we also derive a new limit for the _ hydrogen _ burning minimum mass ( hbmm ) , i.e. the brown dwarf limit , which is found to be lower than previous estimates , a direct consequence of non - grey effects .",
    "the mass - dependence of photospheric quantities is examined in  4 .",
    "section 5 is devoted to the concluding remarks .",
    "the lyon evolutionary code has been originally developped at the gttingen observatory ( langer et al . 1989 ; baraffe and el eid , 1991 and references therein ) and is based on one - dimensional implicit equations of stellar structure , solved with the henyey method ( kippenhahn and weigert , 1990 ) .",
    "convection is described by the mixing - length theory . throughout the present paper ,",
    "we use a mixing length equal to the pressure scale height , l@xmath18 = h@xmath19 as a reference calculation .",
    "as discussed in  3.2 , the choice of this parameter is inconsequential for the evolution of objects below @xmath20 . for larger masses ,",
    "the dependence of the results on the mixing length is examined in bcah97 , along comparison with observations .",
    "the updated livermore opacities ( opal , iglesias & rogers 1996 ) are used for the inner structure ( t @xmath21 10 000k ) .",
    "the effect of the improved opal opacities compared to the previous generation ( rogers & iglesias , 1992 ) on the evolution of vlm stars ( bcah95 ; chabrier , baraffe & plez 1996 ) is found to be negligible , affecting the effective temperature by less than 1% and the luminosity by less than 3% for a given mass . for lower temperatures",
    ", we use the alexander and fergusson ( 1994 ) opacities .",
    "the helium fraction in the calculations is y=0.275 for solar - like metallicities and y=0.25 for metal - depleted abundances .",
    "an adequate theory for stellar evolution requires i ) an accurate eos , ii ) a correct treatment of the nuclear reaction rates , iii ) accurate atmosphere models and iv ) a correct treatment of the boundary conditions between the interior and the atmophere profiles along evolution .",
    "each of these inputs is discussed in the following sub - sections .",
    "interior profiles of vlms range from @xmath22 k and @xmath23 g @xmath8 at the base of the photosphere ( defined as @xmath24 ) to @xmath25 k and @xmath26 g @xmath8 at the center for a 0.6 @xmath0 star , and from @xmath27 k and @xmath28 g @xmath8 to @xmath29 k and @xmath30 g @xmath8 for a 0.1 @xmath0 , for solar metallicity . within this temperature / density range ,",
    "molecular hydrogen and atomic helium are stable in the outermost part of the stellar envelope , while most of the bulk of the star ( more than 90% in mass ) is under the form of a fully ionized h@xmath31/he@xmath32 plasma .",
    "therefore a correct eos for vlms must include a proper treatment not - only of temperature - ionization and dissociation , well described by the saha - equations in an ideal gas , but most importantly of _ pressure_-ionization and dissociation , as experienced along the internal density / temperature profile , a tremendously more complicated task .",
    "moreover , under the central conditions of these stars , the fully ionized hydrogen - helium plasma is characterized by a plasma coupling parameter @xmath33 for the classical ions ( @xmath34 is the mean inter - ionic distance , @xmath35 is the atomic mass and @xmath36 the _",
    "mass_-density ) and by a quantum coupling parameter @xmath37 ( @xmath38 is the electronic bohr radius and @xmath39 the electron mean molecular weigth ) for the degenerate electrons .",
    "these parameters show that both the ions and the electrons are strongly correlated .",
    "a third characteristic parameter is the so - called _ degeneracy parameter _",
    "@xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the electron fermi energy .",
    "the classical ( maxwell - boltzman ) limit corresponds to @xmath42 , whereas @xmath43 corresponds to complete degeneracy .",
    "the afore - mentioned thermodynamic conditions yield @xmath44 in the interior of vlms along the characteristic mass range , implying that _ finite - temperature _ effects must be included to describe accurately the thermodynamic properties of the correlated electron gas . at last , the thomas - fermi wavelength @xmath45 ( where @xmath46 denotes the electron particle density ) is of the order of the mean inter - ionic distance @xmath34 , so that the electron gas is _ polarized _ by the ionic field , and electron - ion coupling must be taken into account in the plasma hamiltonian .",
    "such a detailed treatment of strongly correlated , polarisable classical and quantum plasmas , plus an accurate description of pressure partial ionization represent a severe challenge for theorists .",
    "several steps towards the derivation of such an accurate eos for vlms have been done since the pioneering work of salpeter ( 1961 ) and we refer the reader to saumon ( 1994 ) and saumon , chabrier and vanhorn ( 1995 ) for a review and a comparison of the different existing eos for vlms . in the present calculations , we use the saumon - chabrier ( sc ) eos ( saumon 1990 ; chabrier 1990 ; saumon & chabrier 1991 , 1992 ; saumon , chabrier & vanhorn 1995 ; scvh ) , specially devoted to the description of low - mass stars , brown dwarfs and giant planets .",
    "this eos presents a consistent treatment of pressure ionization and includes significant improvements w.r.t .",
    "previous calculations in the treatment of the correlations in dense plasmas .",
    "this eos is tied to available monte carlo simulations and high - pressure shock - wave experimental data ( see scvh and references therein for details ) .",
    "as shown in saumon ( 1994 ) and scvh , significant differences exist between the sc eos and other vlms eos , for the pressure - density relations and for the adiabatic gradients , so that we expect substantial differences in the derived stellar radii and entropy profiles .",
    "the scvh eos has been used previously to derive interior models for solar ( chabrier et al .",
    "1992 ; guillot et al .",
    "1995 ) and extrasolar ( saumon et al . 1996 ) giant planets and for brown dwarfs ( burrows et al . 1993 ) .",
    "the sc eos is a pure hydrogen and helium eos , based on the so - called additive - volume - law ( avl ) between the pure components ( h and he ) .",
    "the accuracy of the avl has been examined in detail by fontaine , graboske & vanhorn ( 1977 ) .",
    "the invalidity of the avl to describe accurately the thermodynamic properties of the mixture is significant only in the _ partial ionization _ region ( see e.g. scvh ) . as mentioned above , this concerns only a few percents of the stellar mass under lms conditions . given the negligible _ number_-abundance of metals in stars ( @xmath47 by mass , i.e. @xmath48 by number ) we expect the presence of metals to be inconsequential on the eos .",
    "their contribution to the perfect gas term is just proportional to the number density ( @xmath49 ) , i.e. @xmath50 , whereas their non - ideal ( correlation ) contribution can be estimated either by the debye - huckel correction ( @xmath51 ) for @xmath52 or by the electrostatic ( ion - sphere ) term ( @xmath53 ) for @xmath54 . for solar metal - abundance ( see e.g. grevesse & noels , 1993 ) this yields an estimated contribution to the eos of @xmath55 compared with the hydrogen+helium contribution .",
    "although this simple estimation shows that metals do not contribute appreciably to the eos of vlms , as long as the _ structure _ and the _ evolution _ are concerned , we have decided to conduct complete calculations by comparing models derived with the sc eos and models based on the so - called mhd eos ( hummer & mihalas , 1988 ; mihalas , hummer & dppen , 1988 ) , which includes the contribution of heavy elements under solar abundances . although the mhd eos is devoted to stellar _ envelopes _ and weakly correlated plasmas , like the solar interior ( @xmath56 ) , and thus can not be applied to vlms , it provides a useful tool for the present test .",
    "the test is even strengthened by comparing the complete mhd eos with the pure hydrogen - helium ( @xmath57 ) mhd eos kindly provided by w. dppen .",
    "note that the mhd eos for mixtures does not assume the additive - volume law between the various components , so that comparison with this eos provides also a test for the validity of this approximation .",
    "figure 1 shows in a hr diagram the results obtained with the mhd eos for solar metallicity ( open circles ) and for @xmath57 ( triangles ) up to 1 @xmath0 .",
    "case is shown only to illustrate the effect of metals in the eos for the sun ; it is not intented to reproduce an accurate solar model , since we use a mixing length l@xmath18 = h@xmath19 in the present calculations ] the difference is less than 1% in @xmath58 and 4% in l. this demonstrates convincingly the negligible contribution of the metals to the eos over the entire lms mass range . as shown above , the contribution of metals to the eos is proportional to a power of the charge @xmath59 and the atomic mass @xmath35 . therefore , when applying a metal free eos to solar metallicity objects , the presence of metals can be mimicked by an equivalent helium fraction @xmath60 in the eos , at fixed hydrogen abundance .",
    "varying x instead of y would yield larger differences in @xmath58 and @xmath61 .",
    "figure 1 also displays results based on the sc eos , with the afore - mentioned equivalent helium fraction ( filled circles ) .",
    "both the sc and mhd eos yield very similar results .",
    "the differences between the sc and the complete ( @xmath62 ) mhd eos amount to less than 1.3% in @xmath58 and 1% in @xmath61 . below 0.3 @xmath0 , however , the track based on the mhd eos starts to deviate substantially from the one based on the sc eos , a fairly reasonable limit for an eos primarily devoted to solar conditions .",
    "this is better illustrated in figure 2 , which displays the adiabatic gradient along the density - profile in a 0.2 @xmath0 and a 0.6 @xmath0 star for the sc and mhd eos .",
    "for the 0.6 @xmath0 star , slight discrepancies between the sc and mhd adiabatic gradient appear in the regime of partial ionisation of hydrogen and helium ( log @xmath36 @xmath63 -4 to -0.5 and log t @xmath63 4.2 to 5.3 ) .",
    "the differences become substantial for the 0.2 @xmath0 star because of the strong departure from ideality in a large part of the interior .",
    "the main discrepancies appear for log @xmath64 , with log t @xmath65 and @xmath66 , which marks the onset of hydrogen pressure and temperature partial ionisation .",
    "the unphysical negative value of the adiabatic gradient in the mhd eos for log @xmath67 clearly illustrates the invalidity of the mhd eos to describe the interior of dense systems , as clearly stated by its authors ( see hummer & mihalas , 1988 ) .",
    "similar discrepancies occur also for other lms eos ( see saumon 1994 ; scvh ) , which will affect substantially the structure and the _ evolution _ of these convective objects .",
    "we emphasize the excellent agreement between both eos in the domain of validity of the mhd eos , even though the sc eos does not include heavy elements .",
    "this clearly demonstrates the negligible effect of metals on the adiabatic gradient .",
    "this latter is essentially determined by hydrogen and helium pressure- and temperature- ionisation and/or molecular dissociation .",
    "these calculations clearly demonstrate that metal - free eos can be safely used to describe the structure and the evolution of lms with a solar abundance of heavy elements , providing the use of an effective helium fraction to mimic the effect of metals .",
    "it also assesses the validity of the saumon - chabrier eos , devoted primarily to dense and cool objects , for solar - like masses on the _ speed of sound _ ) , the effect of metals can become important and the mhd eos or the opal eos ( rogers & iglesias , 1992 ) , specially devoted to such study , must be used . ] .",
    "the thermonuclear processes relevant from the energetic viewpoint under the central temperatures and densities characteristic of vlms are given by the ppi chain :    @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70    the destruction of @xmath71 by reaction ( 3 ) is important only for t @xmath72 k i.e masses m @xmath73 for ages @xmath74 10 gyrs , since the lifetime of this isotope against destruction becomes eventually smaller than a few gyrs . in the present calculations ,",
    "we have also examined the burning of light elements , namely li , be and b , whose abundances provide a powerfull diagnostic to identify the mass of vlms and brown dwarfs ( see  3.3 ) .",
    "our nuclear network includes the main nuclear - burning reactions of @xmath75 and @xmath76 ( cf .",
    "nelson et al . 1993 ) .",
    "we will focus on the depletion of the most abundant isotopes @xmath77 and @xmath76 , described by the following reactions :    @xmath78 @xmath79 @xmath80    the rates for these reactions are taken from caughlan and fowler ( 1988 ) .",
    "these rates correspond to the reactions in the vacuum , or in an almost perfect gas where kinetic energy largely dominates the interaction energy . as already mentioned , such conditions are inappropriate for vlms . in dense plasmas ,",
    "the strongly correlated surrounding particles act collectively to screen the bare coulomb repulsion between two fusing particles .",
    "this will favor the reaction and then enhance substantially the reaction rate with respect to its value in the vaccuum . as mentioned in  2.1 , under the central conditions characteristic of low - mass stars , the electrons are only partially degenerate and are polarized by the ionic field .",
    "this responsive electronic background will also screen the nuclear reactions and must be included in the calculations . under the conditions of interest , both enhancement factors , ionic and electronic , are of the same order , i.e. a few units ( chabrier 1997 ) .",
    "different treatments of these enhancement factors have been derived , again following the pioneering work of salpeter ( 1954 ) .",
    "a complete treatment of the _ ionic _ screening contribution over the whole stellar interior density - range , from the low - density debye - huckel limit to the high - density ion - sphere limit was first derived by dewitt et al .",
    "( 1973 ) and graboske et al .",
    "the inclusion of _ electron _ polarisability , in the limit of _ strongly degenerate _",
    "electrons , i.e. @xmath81 and @xmath43 , was performed by yakovlev and shalybkov ( 1989 ) .",
    "an improved treatment of the ionic factor , and the extension of the electron response to finite degeneracy , as found in the interior of vlms , was performed recently by chabrier ( 1997 ) .",
    "the difference between the graboske et al . and the chabrier results , which illustrates both the improvement in the calculation of the ionic factor and the effect of electron polarisability , is shown on figure 3 along temperature profiles characteristic of vlms , for two central densities , for li - burning ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "substantial differences appear , in particular in the intermediate - screening regime ( @xmath83 ) characteristic of lms and bd interiors .",
    "the larger the charge , the larger the effect ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "such differences translate into differences in the abundances as a function of time and mass , as will be examined in  3.3 .",
    "note that the inclusion of electron polarisability was found to decrease substantially the deuterium - burning minimum mass ( saumon et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "the _ initial _ d - burning phase ends after @xmath85 yrs and is inconsequential for the rest of the evolution and the position on the main sequence ( burrows , hubbard & lunine , 1989 and  3 below ) .",
    "we focus in this section on the deuterium production / destruction rate along the ppi reactions , given by eqn .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , which is essential for the nuclear energy generation required to reach thermal equilibrium . for stars below @xmath86 , which are entirely convective ( see  3.2 ) , the deuterium lifetime against proton capture @xmath87 is found to be much smaller than the mixing timescale in the central regions , where energy production takes place .",
    "the mixing time in these regions is estimated from the mixing- length theory ( mlt ) , @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the mean velocity of turbulent eddies .",
    "these fully convective stars are essentially adiabatic throughout most of their interior , with a degree of superadiabaticity @xmath90 variing from @xmath5 10@xmath91 to @xmath92 from the center to 99% of the mass .",
    "thus the mixing - length parameter is inconsequential , and a reasonable estimate for the mixing length is the pressure scale height @xmath93 .",
    "this yields a mixing timescale @xmath94 s , to be compared with @xmath95 s in the central part of the star where nuclear energy production takes place .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.4 where both timescales are compared in a 0.075 @xmath0 star evolving on the main sequence .",
    "since deuterium is burned much more quickly than it is mixed , a deuterium abundance gradient will develop in the central layers .",
    "this process can be described by the stationary solution of the following diffusion equation , since the diffusion and the nuclear timescales are orders of magnitudes smaller than the evolution time :    @xmath96    here @xmath97 is the convective mixing diffusion coefficient , @xmath98 and @xmath99 are the respective rates of reactions ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , and @xmath100 and @xmath101 denote respectively the hydrogen and the deuterium abundances by number ( @xmath102 , following the notations of clayton 1968 ) .",
    "as long as @xmath103 , the deuterium abundance @xmath104 in each burning layer will be close to its nuclear quasi - equilibrium value , as given by @xmath105 in eq.(7 ) .",
    "the abundance of deuterium is relevant only in the central region , where we adopt the equilibrium value .",
    "the complicated task of solving eq.(7 ) is thus not necessary in this case .",
    "the nuclear energy production - rate of the @xmath106 reaction is then given by :    @xmath107    where @xmath108 is the energy of the @xmath106 reaction .",
    "note that during the _ initial _ deuterium burning phase , this situation does not occur and the deuterium abundance is calculated like other species in the network , under the usual _ instantaneous mixing _ approximation , which corresponds to @xmath109 . in that case",
    "abundances are homogeneous throughout the whole burning core , i.e. @xmath110 and the concentration of deuterium is given by an average value over the convective zone @xmath111 .",
    "when @xmath112 , instantaneous mixing will thus overestimate the deuterium - concentration in the central layers .",
    "this can be understood intuitively since instantaneous mixing will provide too much deuterium , i.e. more than produced by nuclear equilibrium , at the bottom , i.e. the hottest part , of the burning region .",
    "this yields an overestimation of the nuclear energy production at a given temperature and @xmath100 , and thus of the total luminosity of the star .",
    "this effect is not drastic for stars m @xmath113 , but increases the luminosity by @xmath114 for 0.1 @xmath0 and by @xmath115 for 0.075 @xmath0 and thus bears important consequences for a correct determination of the stellar to sub - stellar transition .",
    "the low temperature and high pressure in the photosphere of m - dwarfs raise severe problems for the computation of accurate atmosphere models . for these low effective temperatures ( @xmath116 k )",
    "molecules become stable ( h@xmath117 , h@xmath117o , tio , vo , ... ) , and constitute the main source of absorption along characteristic wavelengths .",
    "the presence of these molecular bands complicates tremendously the treatment of radiative transfer , not only because of the numerous transitions to be included in the calculations , but also because the molecular absorption coefficients strongly depend on the frequency and a grey - approximation , as used for more massive stars , is no longer valid . moreover , the high density in m - dwarf atmospheres yields the presence of _ collision - induced _ absorption , an extra degree of complication .",
    "these points have been recognized long ago and motivated various developments in the modelling of m - dwarf atmospheres since the pioneering work of tsuji ( 1966 ) .",
    "substantial improvement in this field has blossomed in recent years with the work of allard and collaborators ( allard 1990 ; allard and hauschildt 1995a ; 1997 ) , brett ( 1995 ) , tsuji and collaborators ( tsuji et al . 1996 ) and saumon ( saumon et al .",
    "1994 ) , due to recent interest in the extreme lower main sequence and the necessity to derive accurate atmophere models to identify the luminosity and the colors of m - dwarfs and brown dwarfs .",
    "we refer the reader to the recent review by allard et al .",
    "( 1997b ) for details .",
    "the present evolutionary calculations are based on the latest generation of lms non - grey atmosphere models at finite metallicity ( allard & hauschildt 1997 ; ah97 ) , labeled @xmath118 . in order to illustrate the most recent improvements in lms atmosphere theory",
    ", we will make comparisons with stellar models based on the previous so - called _ base _ models ( allard and hauschildt 1995a ; ah95 ) , as used in the calculations of baraffe et al .",
    "( 1995 ) . a preliminary version of the _ nextgen _ models was used by chabrier , baraffe & plez ( 1996 ) and baraffe & chabrier ( 1996 ) and compared with results based on the other source of non - grey atmosphere models presently available , computed by brett and plez ( brett 1995 ; plez 1995 , private communication ; bp95 ) .",
    "this latter set , however , is restricted to solar metallicity . as shown in chabrier et al .",
    "( 1996 ) the bp95 models lead to @xmath58 intermediate between the @xmath119 and @xmath118 models , for a given mass .",
    "note that the ah97 models used in the present work include improved molecular opacity treatment compared to the straight mean method used in the _ base _ models , and the more recent water linelist of miller et al .",
    "( 1994 ) ( see ah97 for details ) .",
    "a summary of the main differences in the input of these atmosphere models is outlined in chabrier et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .    as shown e.g. by jones et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , the models still predict too strong infrared water bands despite the inclusion of these new ( even if still incomplete and preliminary ) water linelists ( see ah97 ) . this shortcoming , and the remaining uncertainties in the calculation of the @xmath120 absorption coefficients , represent the main limitation of present vlms atmosphere models for solar - like metallicities .",
    "a second limitation comes from grain formation below @xmath121 ( tsuji , ohnaka & aoki ; 1996 ) which is likely to affect the spectra and the atmosphere structure of the coolest m - dwarfs , and brown dwarfs , for solar - metallicity .",
    "work in this direction is under progress .",
    "the last but not least problem arising in the modelization of vlms is the determination of accurate outer boundary conditions ( bc ) to solve the set of internal structure equations .",
    "all previous vlms models relied on grey atmosphere models . the bc were based either on a @xmath122 ) relationship ( burrows et al .",
    "1989 ; dorman et al . 1989 ; dantona & mazzitelli 1994 , 1996 ; alexander et al .",
    "1996 ) or were obtained by solving the radiative transfer equations ( burrows et al .",
    "1993 ) . in order to make consistent comparison with these models , and to demonstrate the limits of a grey approximation for vlms",
    ", we first give a short overview of the various procedures used in the literature .",
    "@xmath122 ) relationships have the generic form : @xmath123 with different possible q(@xmath124 ) functions ( mihalas , 1978 ) .",
    "the most simple form is based on the eddington approximation , which assumes that the radiation field is isotropic , which yields q(@xmath124)=2/3 , as used in burrows et al .",
    "an exact solution of the grey problem ( mihalas 1978 ) gives actually a function which departs slightly from 2/3 , but this correction is inconsequential on the resulting evolutionary models ( baraffe & chabrier 1995 ) .    as mentioned in the previous sub - section , the strong frequency - dependence of the molecular absorption coefficients yields synthetic spectra which depart severely from a frequency - averaged energy distribution ( see e.g. allard 1990 ; saumon et al .",
    "modifications of the function q(@xmath124 ) have been derived in the past in order to mimic departures from greyness ( henyey et al .",
    "1965 , as used by dantona & mazzitelli 1994 ; krishna - swamy 1966 , as used by dorman et al . 1989 ) .",
    "these corrections , however , are based at least partly on ad - hoc calibrations to the sun and do not rely on reliable grounds .",
    "the assumption of a temperature stratification following a @xmath122 ) relationship requires not only a grey approximation _ but also _ the assumption of radiative equilibrium , implying that all the energy in the optically thin layers is transported by radiation .",
    "however , below @xmath125 k , molecular hydrogen recombination in the envelope ( h+h @xmath126 h@xmath117 ) reduces the entropy and thus the adiabatic gradient ( see scvh ) .",
    "this favors the onset of convective instability in the atmosphere so that convection penetrates deeply into the optically thin layers ( auman 1969 ; dorman et al .",
    "1989 ; allard 1990 ; saumon et al .",

    "this stems from the decreasing sensitivity of the atmosphere structure to metal abundance with decreasing @xmath58 ( see e.g. allard , 1990 ; brett , 1995 ; ah97 ) .",
    "in this paper , we have presented new calculations aimed at describing the structure and the evolution of low mass stars , from solar masses down to the hydrogen burning limit , for a wide range of metallicities .",
    "these calculations include the most recent physics aimed at describing the mechanical and thermal properties of these objects - equation of state , screening factors for the nuclear reaction rates , non - grey atmosphere models - .",
    "the saumon - chabrier hydrogen - helium eos gives the most accurate description of the internal properties of these objects over the entire afore - mentioned mass range .",
    "given their negligible number abundance , metals play essentially no role on the eos itself and their presence is mimicked adequately by an effective helium fraction .",
    "of course they do play a role as electron donors for the opacities and must be included in the appropriate ionization equilibrium equations when _ opacities _ are concerned .",
    "note that , for the _ densest _ stars ( @xmath257 , @xmath258 , @xmath259 ) , departure from ideality at @xmath260 ( resp .",
    "@xmath261 ) in the atmosphere is found to represent @xmath160 ( resp .",
    "@xmath55 ) on the adiabatic gradient ( as obtained from a comparison between the complete sc eos vs an ideal gas eos ) . thus , under lms conditions",
    ", an ideal ( saha ) eos can be safely used over the entire atmosphere , for metallicities @xmath262 . note that an ( incorrect ) grey approximation yield denser atmospheric profiles ( cf  2.4 ) and thus will overestimate non - ideal effects .",
    "we show that under lms conditions , the _ responsive _ electron background participates to the screening of the nuclear reactions , and must be included for an accurate determination of the various minimum burning masses and of the abundances of light elements along evolution .",
    "we show that , near the bottom of the main sequence , the deuterium lifetime against proton capture in the ppi chain is order of magnitudes smaller than the convective mixing time .",
    "instantaneous mixing is thus no longer satisfied .",
    "this yields the presence of a deuterium gradient in the burning core , which bears substantial consequences on the determination of the luminosity near the brown dwarf regime .",
    "we have examined carefully the effect of various grey - like approximations on the evolution and the mass - calibration of lms . under lms conditions , these prescriptions are incorrect , or at best unreliable , and yield inaccurate mass - luminosity and mass - effective temperature relationships , which in turn yield inaccurate _ mass functions _ from observed luminosity functions .",
    "we examine the behaviour of the different stellar macroscopic quantities , radius , temperature , luminosity , as functions of mass , time and metallicity .",
    "we link the general behaviour of these quantities to intrinsic physical properties of stellar matter , in particular the transition from classical to quantum objects and the onset of convection or radiation in the stellar interior and atmosphere .",
    "we derive new limits for the hydrogen - burning minimum mass , effective temperature and luminosity , for each metallicity .",
    "these limits are smaller than the values determined previously , a direct consequence of non - grey effects in the atmosphere .",
    "we believe the present calculations to represent a significant improvement in low - mass star theory and in our understanding of the properties of cool and dense objects .",
    "this provides solid grounds to examine the structure and the evolution of substellar objects , brown dwarfs and exoplanets .    at last",
    "the present models provide reliable mass - luminosity relationships , a cornerstone for the derivation of accurate mass functions ( mra , chabrier & baraffe , 1996 ; chabrier & mra , 1997 ) .",
    "the comparison with observations has already been presented in different _ letters _ ( see references ) , and is examined in detail in two companion papers , namely baraffe et al .",
