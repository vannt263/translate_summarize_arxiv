    "cross sections of the reactions @xmath13 and @xmath2 , are determined by strong and electromagnetic interactions of the light quarks @xmath14 and can not be evaluated at present from first principles . but a rather good description of these cross sections is provided by the vector meson dominance model ( vdm ) with phenomenologically adjusted coupling constants ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) . in the vdm ,",
    "the cross sections are determined by the amplitudes of vector meson v transitions ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) into the final state : @xmath22 , @xmath23 . in the energy range from 980 to 1070 mev ,",
    "the main contributions to the @xmath13 and @xmath2 cross sections come from the @xmath10-meson . therefore the measurement of these cross sections allows us to determine the @xmath10-resonance main parameters and study its interference with other vector mesons .",
    "such studies provide important information about light meson physics .",
    "earlier these processes were studied in several experiments : @xmath24 @xcite , @xmath1 @xcite and @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the snd ( spherical neutral detector ) experiment continues these efforts at the vepp-2 m collider @xcite . here",
    "we present the results of this investigation .",
    "the snd has been operating at the vepp-2 m collider in the energy range from 360 to 1400 mev since 1995 ( the snd detailed description can be found in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the detector contains several subsystems .",
    "the tracking system includes two cylindrical drift chambers .",
    "the three - layer spherical electromagnetic calorimeter is based on nai(tl ) crystals .",
    "the muon / veto system consists of plastic scintillation counters and two layers of streamer tubes .",
    "the calorimeter energy and angular resolution depend on the photon energy as @xmath25{e(\\mbox{gev})}}$ ] and @xmath26{e(\\mathrm{gev } ) } }   \\oplus 0.63^\\circ$ ] .",
    "the tracking system angular resolution is about @xmath27 and @xmath28 for azimuthal and polar angle respectively .",
    "the energy loss resolution @xmath29 in the drift chamber is about 30%  good enough to provide charged kaon identification in the region of @xmath10-meson production .",
    "this work is based on the data sample collected in the snd experiments during 1998 .",
    "the data were collected at 32 energy points in the energy range from 984 to 1060 mev ( table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "the total integrated luminosity accumulated in these experiments is 8.5 pb@xmath30 .",
    "the beam energy was calculated from the magnetic field value in the bending magnets and revolution frequency of the collider . in the vicinity of the @xmath10-meson peak we also used the beam energy calibrated by the cryogenic magnetic detector ( cmd-2 ) , which operated at vepp-2 m at the same time .",
    "this calibration @xcite is based on the measurements of the charged kaon momenta in the drift chamber of cmd-2 .",
    "the energy calibration accuracy in each point is about 0.1 mev , the common shift of the energy scale is estimated to be 0.04 mev , and the energy spread of the beams is about 0.37 mev .    for the luminosity measurements , @xmath31 and",
    "@xmath32 processes were used .",
    "the corresponding luminosity values were respectively used for normalizing the events containing charged particles and those with neutral particles only .",
    "they are different by about 10% ( tab.[tab1 ] ) due to the dead time of the trigger , which selected events containing neutral particles only .",
    "the systematic error of the integrated luminosity determination is estimated to be 2% . since luminosity measurements by @xmath31 and @xmath32",
    "reveal a systematic spread of about 1.3% , this was added to the statistical error of the luminosity determination in each energy point .",
    "the statistical accuracy was better than 1% .",
    "the experimental conditions were rather stable during data taking : the snd systems counting rate , average currents and luminosity of the collider were stable at the level of about 20 % and no correlation between different energy points was observed .",
    "the procedure of the experimental data selection consists of several stages . during the experimental runs ,",
    "the first - level trigger was used @xcite .",
    "the first - level trigger selects events of different types : events with photons only and events with charged particles .",
    "the thresholds applied on the energy deposition in the calorimeter were about 200 mev for events containing charged particles and 300 mev for events with neutral particles only .    during the processing of experimental data ,",
    "the event reconstruction is performed in the following sequence .",
    "the first step is a search for separated clusters in the calorimeter .",
    "track reconstruction in the drift chambers is then performed .",
    "tracks are linked to the calorimeter clusters .",
    "clusters with energy depositions of more than 20 mev , and not linked to tracks in the drift chambers are considered as photons . for charged tracks no requirements on the energy depositions in the calorimeter",
    "are imposed .    for further analysis ,",

    "simulated events were reconstructed and the actual selection criteria were applied . to take into account the apparatus resolution of the first - level trigger thresholds , for simulated and experimental events the trigger conditions were applied with the threshold values 10% higher than during the experimental runs .    as a result of uncertainties in the simulation of the distributions over some selection parameters ,",
    "the detection efficiency was multiplied by correction coefficients , which were obtained in the following way .",
    "the experimental events were selected without any conditions on the parameter under study , using the cut parameters uncorrelated with the studied one .",
    "the same selection was applied for simulated events .",
    "then the cut was applied to the parameter and the correction coefficient was calculated : @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the number of events in experiment and simulation selected without any cuts on the parameter under study ; @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the number of events in experiment and simulation , when the cut on the parameter was applied . as a rule ,",
    "the error in the coefficient @xmath44 determination is connected with the uncertainty of background subtraction .",
    "this systematic error was estimated by varying other selection criteria .",
    "the overlap of the beam background with the events containing charged particles can result in track reconstruction failure and a decrease of detection efficiency . to take into account this effect , background events ( experimental events collected when detector was triggered with an external generator )",
    "were overlapped with the simulated events .",
    "it was found that the detection efficiency decreased by about 3% and therefore the correction coefficient @xmath45 was used for the processes containing charged particles . in the analysis described further simulated events are not overlapped with beam background events .      in the studied energy region",
    "the @xmath0 events have the following features :    * the charged kaons are rather slow ( @xmath46  @xmath47 ) and therefore have large @xmath29 losses in the drift chamber . * events often contain several photons due to the kaon decays ( @xmath48 , @xmath49,@xmath50 , @xmath51 ) in the tracking system .",
    "* tracks attributed to the kaon decays in the tracking system ( secondary particles ) are also present .    to select the @xmath0 events , detection of two charged particles was required , with polar angles in the range @xmath52 , with acollinearity angle in the azimuthal plane @xmath53 and the energy losses in the drift chamber @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is an average @xmath56 loss of a minimum ionizing particle .",

    "after these cuts , the background processes @xmath59 , @xmath60 and also beam and cosmic backgrounds still contribute .",
    "the data accumulated under the @xmath61 production threshold , at the energy point @xmath62{s } = 984 $ ] mev , were used to estimate the number of background events .",

    "so one of the possible approaches to the solution of this problem can be a precise study of these contributions to the total cross section , by means of the measurement of the @xmath13 cross section in a wide energy range .",
    "unfortunately the snd data have rather high systematic errors , which preclude such studies , and they are accumulated in a rather narrow energy region . from snd data ( table  [ tab6 ] ) one can obtain @xmath293{z(m_\\phi ) } } =   0.92 \\pm 0.03.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this value agrees with the quoted world average , but is also consistent with the expected value of 1 ( the difference is about 2.5 standard deviations ) .",

    "the @xmath10-meson total width was found to be @xmath295 mev in contradiction to the pdg value @xmath12 mev . for a good approximation of the @xmath2 cross section the additional contribution",
    "is strongly required , and its value is about 2 times lower than the real part of the @xmath20-meson contribution .",
