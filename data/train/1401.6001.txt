    "it may be worth beginning this introduction with a brief overview of the considerable literature devoted to laplace asymptotic expansions and large deviation principles for the canonical random paths : the brownian motion in @xmath7 . to make things simple",
    ", the aim of these studies is to investigate the asymptotic behaviour as @xmath8 of @xmath9\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is a brownian motion and @xmath11 are general functionals .",
    "schilder s pioneering work @xcite ( see also @xcite ) treated the full asymptotic expansion in the case of wiener integrals .",
    "similar results were obtained for conditioned brownian paths ( such as the brownian bridge ) by davies and truman @xcite .",
    "ellis and rosen @xcite also developed further laplace asymptotic expansions for gaussian functional integrals .",
    "then azencott and doss @xcite used asymptotic expansions to study the semiclassical limit of the schrdinger equation ( see also azencott @xcite ) .",
    "these works initiated a long series ( see for instance @xcite ) and it is beyond the scope of this paper to review the whole literature until nowadays .",
    "one of the aims of this paper is to initiate the study of laplace asymptotics and large deviation principles in the realm of continuous random surfaces .",
    "there is an important conceptual difference between canonical random paths and canonical random surfaces .",
    "whereas brownian motion and its variants are rather nicely behaved , the canonical two dimensional random surface , i.e. the gaussian free field ( gff ) , is much wilder : it can not be defined pointwise for instance and must be understood as a random distribution . as a consequence , many nonlinear functionals defined solely on the space of continuous functions must be defined via renormalization techniques when applied to the gff : see the book of simon @xcite for instance . in this paper , we consider probably the most natural framework of weighted random surfaces : the @xmath0-liouville field theory ( lft ) .",
    "lft is ruled by the ( non critical , i.e. @xmath12 ) liouville action @xmath13\\,\\lambda_{\\hat{g}}({\\mathrm{d}}x)\\ ] ] in the background metric @xmath14 ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 stand for the gradient , curvature and volume form of the metric @xmath14 ) with @xmath18 and @xmath190,2]$ ] .",
    "this is a model describing random surfaces or metrics .",
    "informally , the probability to observe a surface in @xmath20 is proportional to @xmath21 where @xmath20 stands for the `` uniform measure '' on surfaces . to give a rigorous meaning to this definition we have to interpret the term @xmath22 as the law of the centered free field ( see @xcite )",
    "therefore , you replace the brownian motion in by a shifted free field @xmath23 and the nonlinear functional @xmath24 in is the integrated exponential of this free field @xmath25.\\ ] ] such an exponential , also called liouville measure , is nothing but a gaussian multiplicative chaos in @xmath0 .",
    "recall that the theory of gaussian multiplicative chaos , founded in 1985 by kahane @xcite , enables to make sense of the exponential of the gff though the exponential is not defined on the abstract functional space the gff lives on .",
    "our main motivation for considering this framework is to compute the semiclassical limit of @xmath0-liouville quantum field theory and establish a large deviation principle .    before going into further details",
    ", we must mention that there is a sizeable literature on mathematical studies of discrete random surfaces in all dimensions : see for instance the recent review of funaki @xcite .",
    "in particular , within the ( discrete ) framework of gradient perturbations of the gff , there has been an impressive series of results : large deviation principles ( see @xcite ) or central limit theorems ( see @xcite for a convergence to the massless gff in the whole space ) for instance .",
    "nonetheless , the results of this paper bear major differences with the discrete case and , in particular , can not be derived from the discrete frameworks previously considered .",
    "indeed , in the discrete case , one can work in nice functional spaces whereas , in the continuum setting of this paper , the gff lives in the space of distributions and not in a functional space .",
    "besides , an important aspect of our work is the derivation of an exact equivalent for the partition function ( see below ) and more generally the laplace transform of the field @xmath23 : this is a specifc feature of the continuum setting which is essential in the problem of establishing exact relations for the three point correlation function , the celebrated dozz formula @xcite derived on the sphere ( see @xcite for a recent article on this problem )",
    ".    now recall that , in the physics literature , the liouville action enables to describe random metrics in liouville quantum gravity in the conformal gauge as introduced by polyakov @xcite ( studied by david @xcite and distler - kawai @xcite , see also the seminal work of knizhnik - polyakov - zamolodchikov @xcite in the light cone gauge ) or in @xmath0 string theory ( see klebanov s review @xcite for instance ) .",
    "there are many excellent reviews on this topic @xcite .",
    "the rough idea is to couple the action of a conformal matter field ( say a planar model of statistical physics at its critical point so as to become conformally invariant ) to the action of gravity .",
    "this gives a couple of random variables @xmath26 , where the random metric @xmath27 encodes the structure of the space and @xmath28 stands for the matter field .",
    "liouville quantum gravity in @xmath0 can thus be seen as a toy model to understand in quantum gravity how the interaction with matter influences the geometry of space - time . in the conformal gauge and up to omitting some details , the law of this couple of random variables tensorizes @xcite and the marginal law of the metric @xmath27 is given by the liouville action .",
    "the only way the metric keeps track of its interaction with the matter field @xmath28 is through the parameter @xmath2 , called liouville conformal factor , which can be explicitly expressed in terms of the central charge @xmath29 of the matter field using the celebrated kpz result @xcite @xmath30 therefore , the influence of the matter is parameterized by @xmath2 . in a way",
    ", we will see that the geometry of space is encoded in the quantity @xmath31 .",
    "more precisely , we study the so - called semiclassical limit , meaning the convergence of the field @xmath32 when the parameter @xmath8 while keeping fixed the quantity @xmath33 ( thus @xmath34 ) . in the case where @xmath14 is flat or hyperbolic , we prove that the field @xmath35 ( resp . the measure @xmath36 )",
    "converges in law towards the solution @xmath37 ( resp .",
    "@xmath38 ) to the so - called classical liouville equation @xmath39 recall that equation appears when looking for metrics in the conformal equivalence class of @xmath40 with prescribed ricci scalar curvature @xmath41 and has for instance the following explicit form on the unit disk @xmath42 ( equipped with the flat metric , i.e. take @xmath14 equal to the euclidean metric ) @xmath43 with @xmath440,1[$ ] when imposing dirichlet boundary condition on @xmath45 . the quantity @xmath41 describes the expected curvature of the random metric @xmath46 ( see figure [ bob ] ) for small @xmath2 .",
    "the fact that this quantity is negative reflects the hyperbolic nature of the geometry of space .",
    "we also characterize the leading order fluctuations around this hyperbolic geometry .",
    "they are gaussian and massive in the sense that the rescaled field @xmath47 converges towards a massive free field in the metric @xmath48 .",
    "the mass of this free field is @xmath5 and thus exactly corresponds to minus the curvature : the more curved the space is , the more massive the gaussian fluctuations are .",
    "then we investigate the possible deviations away from this hyperbolic geometry : we prove that the liouville field satisfies a large deviation principle with an explicit good rate function , the liouville action given by .",
    "this rate function is non trivial , admits a unique minimum on the solution to the liouville equation with curvature @xmath5 .",
    "the proof is based on computing the exact asymptotic expansion of expression when @xmath49 is the exponential of a linear function of @xmath23 : in fact , this exact expression ( see below when @xmath50 ) is the main result of this paper as all the other results stem from this equivalent . in a way",
    ", this shows that this hyperbolic description of the geometry of the space is rather sharp as it shows that drifting away from the liouville equation arises only with exponentially small probability .        on the other hand ,",
    "we investigate the liouville action with heavy matter insertions .",
    "this means that we plug @xmath51 exponential terms of the form @xmath52 ( with @xmath53 ) in the liouville action in order to compute the @xmath51-point correlation functions of lft .",
    "we prove that the liouville field @xmath35 then concentrates on the solution of the liouville equation with sources ( where @xmath54 stands for the dirac mass at @xmath55 ) @xmath56 this equation appears when one looks for a metric with prescribed negative curvature @xmath5 and conical singularities at the points @xmath57 ( see figure [ pikedbob ] ) .",
    "each source @xmath58 creates a singularity with shape @xmath59 in the metric @xmath48 .",
    "such singularities are called conical as they are locally isometric to a cone with `` deficit angle '' @xmath60 ( see figure [ fig : cone ] ) .",
    "( -20:1 ) arc ( -20:240:1 ) ; ( -20:1 )  ( 0:0 )  ( 240:1 ) ; ( 240:0.4 ) arc ( 240:340:0.4 ) ; ( 290:0.4 ) node[below]@xmath61 ; ( 2,0 ) to[bend left ] ( 3,0 ) ; ( 4,-0.5 ) .. controls ( 4,-1 ) and ( 6,-1 ) .. ( 6,-0.5 ) ",

    "the mass of this free field is once again minus the curvature , namely @xmath5 .",
    "we also establish a large deviation principle with an explicit good rate function , which is non trivial and admits a unique minimum on the solution of the liouville equation with sources .    * conformal gravity in @xmath62 . *",
    "let us stress that an analog @xmath62-conformal field theory have been studied in the physics literature ( see @xcite ) from quantized gravity .",
    "the dynamics are governed by the wess - zumino action and the weyl action . basically , the underlying idea is that the @xmath62 paneitz operator is conformally covariant and yields a notion of @xmath63-curvature .",
    "to put it simply , we can consider the euclidean background metric so that the paneitz operator simply becomes the bilaplacian .",
    "the action then becomes @xmath64\\,\\lambda({\\mathrm{d}}x),\\ ] ] which is the @xmath62 analog of in @xmath62 in flat background metric .",
    "the important point for our purposes is that the corresponding free field action ( @xmath65 ) generates a log - correlated gaussian field so that our approach applies word for word . in passing",
    ", we mention that such a theory shares fractal properties similar to @xmath0 liouville field theory , like the geometrical kpz formula , as proved in @xcite .",
    "the semiclassical limit is described in terms of the equation @xmath66 which is a prescription of constant ( negative ) @xmath63-curvature .",
    "the reader may consult @xcite for more on this topic of @xmath63-uniformization of @xmath62-surfaces .",
    "heavy matter operators may be added as well , leading to a perturbed equation with additional sources ( i.e. dirac masses ) .",
    "this approach can also be generalized to even larger dimensions by considering the conformally covariant gjms operators , which take the simple form @xmath67 in even @xmath68-dimensional flat space .",
    "* discussion on possible extensions or other geometries .",
    "* extra boundary terms @xmath69\\,d\\ell,\\ ] ] where @xmath70 stands for the length element on @xmath71 in the metric @xmath14 and @xmath72 for the geodesic curvature on @xmath71 , may be considered as well in the liouville action .",
    "these boundary terms rule the behaviour of the liouville field on the boundary and gives rise to the boundary liouville field theory .",
    "we will refrain from considering these extra terms here : our purpose is to expose some aspects of lft mainly to mathematicians and we wish to avoid these further complications .",
    "yet , this would be a first natural ( and non trivial ) extension of our work .    in this paper , we focus on the unit disk with flat or hyperbolic geometry . of particular interest",
    "is the construction of lft on the sphere .",
    "it can be constructed by taking the large @xmath73 limit of @xmath0 liouville quantum gravity on the disk with radius @xmath73 and a curvature bump on its boundary ( see @xcite ) . in that case",
    ", the semi - classical limit exhibits some further interesting features .",
    "the point is that the limiting equations requires to construct a hyperbolic structure on the sphere , which is rather not inclined to support such a structure .",
    "this can be addressed by taking care of the nature of the insertions in the surface : there are some additional constraints on the insertions @xmath74 , which are called seiberg bound in the physics literature .",
    "this problem also receives a new growing interest in the community of differential geometry : the reader may consult for instance @xcite and references therein for more on this topic and other closely related topics , like the toda system .",
    "indeed , another natural extension of our work could be to consider the large deviations of toda field theories .",
    "in fact , tilting the free field measure with any nonlinear functional of the free field that yields interesting critical points for the laplace method deserves to be investigated .",
    "the authors wish to address special thanks to franois david .",
    "this work originates from one of the numerous discussions we have had with him , where he gave us hints to construct the liouville action on the hyperbolic disk .",
    "the authors are also very indebted to andrea malchiodi and yannick sire who patiently explained to them how to deal with equation .",
