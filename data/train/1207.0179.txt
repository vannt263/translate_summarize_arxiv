    "if the lepton number conservation is violated in a new physics model beyond the sm , neutrinos can be majorana particles which form a mass term with its self - conjugation field only  @xcite , since neutrinos are electrically neutral unlike to all other sm fermions .",
    "therefore , it seems natural to expect that the possible majorana nature of neutrinos provides the reason why neutrinos have very different masses from those of other sm fermions .",
    "the doubly charged scalar boson @xmath1 , which has a twice electrical charge of the electron , exists in several models to generate majorana neutrino masses . for instance , the particle is a member of an @xmath2 triplet scalar field in the higgs triplet model  ( htm )  @xcite .",
    "the triplet field develops a tiny vacuum expectation value  ( vev ) , which breaks the lepton number conservation and is the source of the neutrino mass .",
    "such a triplet field appears also in some models of extended gauge symmetries  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a doubly charged scalar boson is introduced as an @xmath2 singlet scalar field in the zee - babu model  ( zbm )  @xcite which generates majorana neutrino masses at the two - loop level . in these models with @xmath1 , its yukawa interactions with charged leptons depend on the @xmath2 property of @xmath1 .",
    "namely , @xmath1 from an @xmath2 triplet field couples only with left - handed charged leptons @xmath3 while the one from an @xmath2 singlet field interacts only with right - handed charged leptons @xmath4 .",

    "the new yukawa interaction is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the lepton doublet field , the yukawa coupling matrix is symmetric @xmath13 , @xmath14 are the pauli matrices , and @xmath15 in the htm , the doubly charged scalar boson interacts with a pair of _ left - handed _ charged leptons .",
    "the neutrino mass matrix in the flavor basis is obtained as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the vev of the triplet field , @xmath18 is the neutrino mass matrix in the diagonal basis , and @xmath19 is the maki - nakagawa - sakata  ( mns ) matrix for the lepton flavor mixing .",
    "since the neutrino mass matrix is directly related to the yukawa matrix , the decay patterns of the doubly charged scalar boson are constrained by observed neutrino oscillation data  @xcite .",
    "for example , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are required because the observed neutrino mass matrix approximately has the @xmath22-@xmath8 exchange symmetry . by assuming the realistic values of decay branching ratios , constraints on the mass of @xmath23",

    "we have seen that the invariant - mass distributions are good analyzers of the @xmath8 polarization especially for the hadronic @xmath8 decays .",
    "we have performed a simple monte - carlo simulation for decays of @xmath8 s made from the decays of pair - produced @xmath0 . if @xmath177 mode exists ( @xmath178 )",
    ", the invariant - mass distribution of @xmath179 gives the best analysis power on @xmath8 polarization .",
    "the background contribution can be highly reduced by requiring @xmath180 whose invariant - mass is @xmath181 .",
    "we have shown that @xmath182 mode followed by @xmath183 for both @xmath8 is also useful to discriminate the @xmath8 polarization by using the distribution of the invariant - mass of @xmath155 .",
    "even if there is no @xmath184 , we have found that @xmath8 polarization can be determined by the distribution of the invariant - mass @xmath185 in @xmath186 mode with a leptonic and a pionic @xmath8 decays .",
    "the reduction of the background events can be achieved by requiring same - signed @xmath70 with the collinear approximation method .",
