    "a study of abundances and their gradients is based on measurements of emission line spectra of individual hii regions in nearby galaxies . to define the parameters of radial distribution of oxygen and nitrogen abundances ( the extrapolated central intercept value and the gradient ) , the abundance measurements for a sufficiently large number of hii regions evenly distributed across the galaxy disk are necessary .",
