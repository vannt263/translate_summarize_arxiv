    "cl0024 + 17 is one of the most extensively studied lensing clusters of galaxies , located at @xmath2 . since the discovery of the multiply lensed arc system",
    ", several authors modeled the matter distributions in the cluster .",
    "tyson , kochanski , & dellantonio ( 1998 ) constructed a very detailed mass map and suggested that the dark matter profile has a soft core .",
    "broadhurst et al .",
    "( 2000 ) measured the arc redshift to be 1.675 and also built a lens model in a simplified manner .",
    "on the other hand , the x - ray emitting gas is an excellent tracer of the dark matter potential .",
    "soucail et al .",
    "( 2000 ) performed a combined analysis of the _ rosat _ and _ asca _ data and estimated the cluster mass within the arc radius ( the x - ray mass , hereafter ) .",
    "they found that there is about a factor of @xmath3 discrepancy between the x - ray mass and the strong lensing mass ( tyson et al .",
    "1998 ; broadhurst et al .",
    "because the _ rosat _ hri image suggested the elongated gas distribution , they considered that the discrepancy may be caused by the irregular mass distribution .",
    "however , there were still large measurement uncertainties in both the x - ray temperature and the image morphology .",
    "it was mainly because of the heavy contamination from the bright seyfert galaxy .",
    "thus for the cluster mass estimation the temperature determination is crucial . in this paper",
    ", we report on the accurate measurements of the temperature and the morphology with _",
    "chandra _ ,",
    "from which we discuss whether there is an inevitable mass discrepancy between the x - ray and the strong lensing .",
    "we use @xmath4 km / s / mpc and @xmath5 . @xmath6",
    "kpc at @xmath2 .",
    "we observed cl0024 + 17 with the _ chandra _ acis - s detector on september 20 , 2000 .",
    "the net exposure time is 37121 sec . in figure 1a , we show the acis - s3 image .",
    "the strongest x - ray peak is at ( 00:26:36.0 , + 17:09:45.9)@xmath7 and the extended emission is detected out to @xmath8 in radius .",
    "the point sources detected in the field were removed in the following analysis .",
    "we extracted the cluster spectrum from a circular region of @xmath9 , centered at the x - ray peak ( the dashed circle in figure 1a ) .",
    "the background was estimated from the @xmath10 ring region .",
    "we fitted the spectrum to the mekal thin - thermal plasma model with the galactic absorption ( figure 2a ) and determined the temperature to be @xmath11 kev ( 90% error ) .",
    "this is consistent with our previous result with _ asca _",
    "( soucail et al . 2000 ; ota & mitsuda 2002 ) .",
    "we detected the strong redshifted fe - k line from the cluster for the first time .",
    "the iron abundance is @xmath12 solar .    in order to investigate the radial temperature profile , we accumulated spectra from four ring regions with various radii and fitted them with the mekal model .",
    "the radius ranges were chosen so that the each spectrum contains more than 400 photons .",
    "we found that there is not any meaningful temperature variation against radius ( figure 2b ) ; the gas is consistent with being isothermal .",
    "though the original acis ccd has a pixel size of @xmath13 , we rebinned the image by a factor of 4 .",
    "we restrict the energy range to 0.5  5 kev in the image analysis .",
    "we find that there is the second x - ray peak at ( 00:26:35.1,+17:09:38.0)@xmath7 . from comparison with the galaxy catalog by czoske et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , we recognized that the three central bright elliptical galaxies are located at the positions consistent with the fist and second x - ray peaks ( g1 and g2 , hereafter ) .",
    "note that g1 contains two of the three elliptical galaxies ( figure 1a ) .      in order to determine the x - ray emission profile of the icm , we fitted the 2-dimensional surface brightness distribution with a model consisting of three @xmath1 profiles which we consider to represent emissions from two elliptical - galaxy components and icm component ; @xmath14 .",
    "we fitted the image of @xmath15 region with the maximum - likelihood method .",
    "the center positions of the two elliptical - galaxy components were fixed at the g1 and g2 peaks , respectively , while for the third component , which we consider describes the icm emission , the position was allowed to vary .",
    "the results of the fits are shown in table 1 and figure 1b . in order to check the goodness of the fit , we rebinned the image into two single dimensional profiles of two perpendicular directions and calculated the @xmath16 values between the model and data profiles to find they are enough small ( @xmath17 for 99 degree of freedom ) .",
    "the best - fit cluster center position is @xmath18kpc away from the g1 peak .",
    "we consider that the emission of g1 and g2 can be attributed to the elliptical galaxies because of the small luminosities .",
    "furthermore , we tested the significance of the ellipticity of the cluster image and found it is not significant ( @xmath19 ) .",
    ".results of the 2-d image fitting with the three @xmath1-models [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     \\(f ) fixed parameters . @xmath20",
    "the 90% errors are @xmath21 for ra and @xmath22 for dec .",
    "from the spectral and spatial analysis mentioned above , we found that the gas is isothermal and can be described with the spherical @xmath1-model . assuming the gas is hydrostatic",
    ", we obtained the projected x - ray mass within the arc radius to be @xmath23 . on the other hand ,",
    "the strong lensing mass was estimated to be @xmath24 by tyson et al .",
    "therefore the discrepancy of a factor of 3 is evident .",
    "this is consistent with our previous result ( soucail et al . 2000 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the x - ray surface brightness profile of the nfw potential is similar to that of the @xmath1-model and can be converted from the @xmath1-model parameters through the relations of @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( makino , sasaki , & suto 1998 ) .",
    "we thus derived the gas profile for the nfw case based on the results of @xmath1-model fitting and estimated the x - ray mass to be @xmath27 .",
    "thus the discrepancy still remains even in this case .    since the gas is isothermal and spherical",
    ", we consider that the gas is relaxed in the cluster potential and the hydrostatic equilibrium is a good approximation in the x - ray mass estimation .",
    "this suggests that the lens mass is significantly overestimated .",
    "czoske et al .",
    "( 2001 , 2002 ) measured the redshift distribution of galaxies in the direction of cl0024 + 17 and revealed the presence of foreground and background groups of galaxies .",
    "this may possibly enhance the strong lensing mass .",
    "thus updated lens modeling of the cluster is urged .",
