    "the seyfert  1 galaxy ngc5548 was the target of intensive space- and ground - based monitoring designed to measure the light travel time across its broad optical - line - emitting region ( @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "these reverberation studies imply that the broad line region ( blr ) has a characteristic diameter @xmath7  40  light days , or @xmath8as for h@xmath9  km  s@xmath10  mpc@xmath10 and the galaxy s recession velocity relative to the 3  k background ( 5354  km  s@xmath10 ; @xcite ) .",
    "given this small size , is it possible to constrain models for the ultimate energy source for the blr in ngc5548 ?",
    "the common view is that the energy source is a supermassive black hole fuelled by an accretion disk ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and three recent findings support this scenario for ngc5548 .",
    "first , analysis of variations in the emission line profiles of ngc5548 suggests that the blr material moves along randomly inclined keplerian orbits defined by a central mass of order @xmath11 ( @xcite ) .",
    "second , the central continuum source must irradiate the blr anisotroptically ( @xcite ) , perhaps because the continuum source is surrounded by an optically - thick accretion disk ( cf .",
    "figure  1 of @xcite ) .",
    "third , ngc5548 exhibits very broad and asymmetric x - ray emission lines whose profiles are well matched by gravitationally - redshifted and fluorescing lines from accretion disk material ( @xcite ) .    still , the starburst hypothesis of terlevich et al .",
    "( 1992 ) potentially offers an alternative energy source : a compact star cluster hosts a supernova and the blr is identified with the compact supernova remnant formed as the supernova ejecta interacts with dense circumstellar material .",
    "although the star cluster hypothesis has yet to be tested against the three findings listed above for ngc5548 , it appears consistent with analysis of the optical continuum variability and the reverberation results ( @xcite ) .",
    "astrometric monitoring of seyfert nuclei offers another strong test of of the starburst hypothesis ( @xcite ) .",
    "the low supernova rates and their short radiative lifetimes mean that as the compact star cluster evolves and new supernovae occur , the blr should dance within the star cluster . in constrast , black hole models for low - power objects like",
    "seyfert nuclei predict no motion of the nucleus over time , or simple linear motion if the emission arises from propogating shocks in a jet and counterjet ( @xcite ) .",
    "this paper imposes observational constraints on the astrometric stability of the radio continuum nucleus of ngc5548 , to help distinguish between star cluster and black hole models for the energy source of the blr .",
    "although the star cluster models do not predict light curves for the radio continuum emission from a compact supernova remnant , terlevich et al .",
    "( 1995 ) do remark on the relevance of sn1988z to their models , as being an example of a ( radio ) supernova expanding into dense circumstellar material ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore this paper also examines the photometric variability of the radio continuum nucleus of ngc5548 , for comparison with the photometric evolution of sn1988z at radio wavelengths .",
    "table  1 gives a log of the astrometric imaging observations of ngc5548 with the very large array ( vla , @xcite ) and the very long baseline array ( vlba , @xcite ) .",
    "both instruments acquired data in dual circular polarizations at the center frequencies tabulated . for each polarization ,",
    "the vla bandwidth was 100  mhz with 3-level sampling and the vlba bandwidth was 32  mhz with 4-level sampling .",
    "all vla and vlba observations after 1990 assumed a coordinate equinox of 2000 .",
    "earlier vla observations assumed an equinox of 1950 and were transformed to 2000 using a reference date of 1979.9 for the phase calibrator grid used at the vla prior to 1990 ( @xcite ) .    on the vla ,",
    "an 8-minute observation of ngc5548 was preceded and followed by an observation of the phase calibrator oq208 ( b1404 + 286 ) about @xmath12 from ngc5548 ( figure  1 ) .",
    "vla observations of 3c286 were used to set the amplitude scale to an accuracy of about 3% . on the vlba ,",
    "a 3-minute observation of ngc5548 was preceded and followed by an observation of the phase , rate , and delay calibrator j1419 + 27 about @xmath13 from ngc5548 ( figure  1 ) .",
    "the position assumed for j1419 + 27 was @xmath14 and @xmath15 , with an error in each coordinate of less than 1  mas ( m.  eubanks , private communication ) .",
    "sources oq208 and j1310 + 32 were also observed with the vlba to check the astrometric accuracy and to align the phases of the baseband channels , respectively .",
    "vlba system temperatures and gains were used to set the amplitude scale to an accuracy of about 5% , after first correcting for sampler errors .",
    "for both the vla and vlba , the position assumed for oq208 was @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( m.  eubanks , private communication ) .",
    "these assumed positions for both j1419 + 27 ( b1417 + 273 ) and oq208 agree with those in ma et al .",
    "the vla data were calibrated using the 1994 january 15 release of the nrao aips software , while the vlba data were calibrated with the 1999 april 15 release .",
    "the aips task imagr was used to form and deconvolve images of the stokes @xmath18 emission from ngc5548 .",
    "neither the vla nor vlba data on ngc5548 were self - calibrated .",
    "the vla images were made with a weighting scheme that achieved high angular resolution without seriously degrading sensitivity .",
    "furthermore , vla imaging tests showed that the peak source strength increased as angular resolution decreased , suggesting that the source was slightly resolved .",
    "thus only vla images with matched resolutions were analysed .",
    "the vlba images were made with natural weighting to optimize sensitivity and were restored with a matched elliptical gaussian beam .",
    "photometric and astrometric comparisons will be limited to observations at matched angular resolutions of 500  mas @xmath0 260  pc ( figure  2 , 9 vla observations ) , 1210  mas @xmath0 640  pc ( figure  3 , 9 vla observations ) , and 2.3  mas @xmath0 1.2  pc ( figure  4 , 3 vlba observations ) .",
    "image rms values ( @xmath19 ) appear in table  1 in units of microjanskys per beam area ( @xmath20jy  ba@xmath10 ) ; all rms values match those expected given the array and observation parameters ( @xcite ) . the image resolutions , expressed either as the fwhm dimension of a circular gaussian beam or the fwhm dimensions and elongation orientation of an elliptical gaussian beam , also appear in table  1 .",
    "the tabulated position peaks were derived from quadratic fits in the image plane . for the vla images ,",
    "these quadratic fits also yielded the peak flux densities listed in the table , along with errors that are quadratic sums of a 3% scale error and @xmath19 .",
    "for the vlba images , the source appeared to be resolved , so total flux densities were derived by integration over @xmath21 beam areas and tabulated along with errors that are quadratic sums of a 5% scale error and @xmath22 .",
    "this apparent resolution could be due either to unmodelled atmospheric and/or station motion effects ( @xcite ) , or due to real structure . that the structure is similar in the vlba images",
    "suggests the latter but does not prove it , because some phase - referencing errors can be systematic from observation to observation .",
    "the table also notes the 1@xmath23 error in each coordinate for the astrometry of the peak position .",
    "@xmath23 is the quadratic sum of a term measuring the peak signal - to - noise ratio ( @xcite ) and a term measuring the accuracy of the absolute astrometry .",
    "this latter term was _ estimated _ in the vla case as follows .",
    "the imaging at 500-mas resolution was done in the same configuration and season as patnaik et al .",
    "( 1992 ) or in the same configuration and contemporaneous with browne et al .",
    "those authors used phase calibrators @xmath24 or less from their targets , cycled back to a calibrator every 6 minutes , and measured a 1-d positional accuracy of about 10  mas rms .",
    "the present work involves a calibrator @xmath12 from the target ( figure  1 ) but observed with a 10-minute cycle time , so 20  mas was adoted as an estimate for the 1-d accuracy of the absolute vla astrometry . in the vlba case ,",
    "the accuracy of the absolute astrometry was _ derived _ from analysis of the astrometric check source oq208 , as referenced to j1419 + 27 . as figure  1 shows , oq208 and j1419 + 27",
    "are separated by about @xmath25 , while the separation between j1419 + 27 and ngc5548 is about @xmath13 .",
    "thus the position error for oq208 as referenced to j1419 + 27 , plotted in figure  5 , serves as a cautious upper limit to the position error for ngc5548 as referenced to j1419 + 27 . indeed ,",
    "residual position errors of order 1  mas and 0.7  mas are expected for separations of @xmath25 and @xmath13 , respectively , due to known deficiencies in the 1980 iau nutation model adopted at the correlator ( @xcite ) .",
    "photometric monitoring results from table  1 are plotted in figure  6 .",
    "each figure panel shows results for a given angular resolution within 100 days centered on the mean observation epoch indicated .",
    "data at 8.4  ghz are plotted as dark symbols , while data at 4.9  ghz appear as light symbols .",
    "the figure legend indicates which symbols encode which matched angular resolutions .",
    "photometric comparisons should only be made among data at matched resolutions .",
    "to aid such comparisons the pairs of panels at the top , middle , and bottom of figure  6 show data at matched resolution , with the left columns having the earlier mean epoch of observation .",
    "figure  6 demonstrates that the radio nucleus of ngc5548 is photometrically variable , on timescales that are both short ( comparing within a panel ) and long ( comparing across paired panels ) . specifically , the maximum flux densities are higher than minimum flux densities , by @xmath1% between vla observations separated by 41  days ( panel [ d ] ) and by @xmath2% between vla observations separated by 4.1  yr ( panel [ a ] _ versus _ [ b ] ) .",
    "panel ( d ) also establishes that the 41-day `` flare '' is milder ( @xmath3% ) at 4.9  ghz than at 8.4  ghz .",
    "furthermore , the spectral index @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) is @xmath28 prior to the 41-day `` flare '' but @xmath4 during the `` flare '' .",
    "thus the `` flare '' is optically thick and milder at the lower frequency , traits typical for variable active nuclei .",
    "the `` flare '' is too poorly sampled to derive a meaningful variability timescale .",
    "the flux densities plotted in figure  6 correspond to 8.4-ghz powers @xmath29  w  hz@xmath10 , while the associated luminosities are @xmath30 erg  s@xmath10 .",
    "the radio sampling in figure  6 is too coarse for useful comparisons with concurrent continuum monitoring from the ground or space .",
    "however , some relevant comparison can be made in connection with the 41-day radio variability between 1993 march 15 and april 25 .",
    "first , that radio variability is much slower then the 1-day and 3-day variability reported for the hard and soft x - rays , respectively , during the period 1992 december to 1993 january ( @xcite ) .",
    "second , the 33% change during the 41-day radio `` flare '' is comparable to the 40% changes documented for the continuum at @xmath31 during the period 1993 march 19 to may 27 ( @xcite ) .      radio continuum emission can arise from ( 1 ) an advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) onto a black hole ( @xcite ) , ( 2 ) jets emerging from an adaf ( @xcite ) , or ( 3 ) jets emerging from a standard accretion disk which itself emits no radio photons ( @xcite ) .",
    "comparisions with these models will assume a black hole mass @xmath11 ( @xcite ) and will try to match the spectral indices @xmath26 , luminosities @xmath32 , and photometric variability observed for the radio nucleus of ngc5548 , plus be consistent with vlba emission being predominantly unresolved .",
    "the radio continuum from an adaf is synchrotron emission fron an x - ray emitting and optically - thin plasma ( @xcite ) , and is characterized by three key traits .",
    "first , equation  1 of yi & boughn ( 1999 ) predicts that the radio power should have an inverted spectral index @xmath33 , consistent with the index measured in the `` flaring '' state ( @xmath4 ) but not in the the quiescent state ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "second , equation  2.7 of yi & boughn ( 1998 ) implies that the 8.4-ghz photons should originate about 6 schwarzschild radii from the black hole , placing them at radii less than @xmath34as , which is consistent with the vlba emission being predominantly unresolved .",
    "finally , equations  1 and 3 of yi & boughn ( 1999 ) predict an 8.4-ghz luminosity @xmath35 erg  s@xmath10 .",
    "this is about @xmath36 times weaker than observed and argues for an alternative source of radio photons .",
    "radio emission from jets is a plausible alternative , but before turning to that topic the existing evidence for outflow from the nucleus of ngc5548 will be described .",
    "figure  7 displays a vla image at 8.4  ghz with resolution 660  mas @xmath0 350  pc and rms sensitivity @xmath37jy  ba@xmath10 .",
    "this deep image was obtained by adding the 1988 - 1989 vla data lacking evidence for photometric variability ( see panels [ a ] and [ c ] in figure  6 ) and two further 1989 observations at lower resolution .",
    "areal integration over the figure yields a total flux density of @xmath38  mjy , corresponding to a total power at 8.4  ghz of @xmath39  w  hz@xmath10 .",
    "figure  7 shows that bipolar lobes straddle the radio nucleus and span 12  arcsec @xmath0 6.4  kpc .",
    "the lobes are very faint at 8.4  ghz , with peak intensities @xmath40jy  ba@xmath10 .",
    "the lobe morphologies confirm previous hints from images at lower resolution ( figure  3 , @xcite ) that the southern lobe is amorphous and the northern lobe is edge - brightened , possibly due to a bubble - like structure in 3-d .",
    "these synchrotron - emitting lobes could be driven by a bipolar wind emanating from the nucleus of ngc5548 , as has been suggested for ngc3079 ( @xcite ) .",
    "models for the absorption of the x - ray and ultraviolet continuum from ngc5548 do imply outflowing ionized gas on subparsec scales ( @xcite ) . the shape of the subparsec outflow ( radial _ versus _ bipolar _ versus _ cylindrical ) is not constrained , but its kinetic luminosity of @xmath41  erg  s@xmath10 is four orders of magnitude higher than the photon luminosities of the radio lobes ( @xcite ) . if the subparsec outflow contains relativistic plasma , then figure  4 could be used to trace the shape of the flow on parsec scales provided the reality of the apparent vlba structure was verified ( see section  2 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that weak synchrotron emission from relativistic plasma on scales 100 - 500  pc could be responsible for the source resolution effects , discussed in section  2 , that prompted the use of matched angular resolutions .",
    "suppose the synchrotron luminosity of the jets on scales @xmath42  pc is powered by a rotating black hole accreting from a magnetized plasma .",
    "then the jet luminosity can be estimated from the blandford - znajek process given values for the spin paramter @xmath43 of the black hole , the efficiency @xmath44 of the jet radio emission , and the mass accretion rate @xmath45 , normalized to the eddington rate ( @xcite ) .",
    "adopting @xmath45 from an adaf analysis of ngc5548 leads to radio jet luminosities of @xmath46 erg  s@xmath10 .",
    "this process could easily match the required radio jet luminosites on scales @xmath47  pc , but the predictions are woefully imprecise compared to the predictions from the adaf models .",
    "this process could also in principal match the kinetic luminosity of @xmath41  erg  s@xmath10 for the subparsec outflow ( @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , in the jet - disk symbiosis model of falcke & biermann ( 1996 ) , the radio jet luminosity and the ( standard ) accretion disk luminosity are correlated .",
    "gauging the latter for ngc5548 by the nuclear bolometric luminosity of @xmath48  erg  s@xmath10 ( @xcite ) , then the radio jet luminosity is as expected from that jet / disk correlation .",
    "moreover , the spectral index of the quiescent radio emission is as expected for an inhomogeneous jet model , while the inverted spectrum during the 41-day `` flare '' could arise from a brightening in the optically - thick base of the jet .",
    "terlevich et al .  (",
    "1995 ) note the relevance of sn1988z to their models , as being an example of a ( radio ) supernova expanding into dense circumstellar material ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is thus of interest to compare the radio properties of this most distant known radio supernova ( @xcite ) , with those of the radio nucleus in ngc5548 .",
    "van dyk et al .  ( 1993 ) conclude that sn1988z is a rare , peculiar type ii supernova , which represents the endpoint of stellar evolution for a massive progenitor ( @xmath49 ) that underwent a period of high mass loss ( @xmath50  yr@xmath10 ) before explosion .",
    "sn1988z achieved a maximum power at 8.4  ghz of about @xmath51  w  hz@xmath10 , similar to the minimum power recorded in figure  6 for the radio nucleus of ngc5548 .",

    "( while the evolution appears to be smooth , the defining light curves are not well sampled in time . )",
    "their models are plotted in figure  8 with an arbitrary epoch shift for comparison with the vla data from panel ( d ) of figure  6 .",
    "the radio supernova models appear able to account for the photometric variability of ngc5548 observed on time scales of years .",
    "those models can not , however , account for the variability observed on time scales of tens of days .",
    "all astrometric monitoring results from table  1 are plotted in figure  9 .",
    "each panel shows data at the matched angular resolution indicated , with the panels ordered as in figure  6 to aid astrometric comparisons among data at matched resolutions . the origin for each panel is taken to be the position of the nucleus measured from the vlba image at epoch 1995.337 .",
    "data at 8.4  ghz are plotted as dark symbols , while data at 4.9  ghz appear as light symbols .",
    "the symbol shapes encode the matched angular resolution and have the same meaning as in figure  6 .",

    "( a ) and ( b ) demonstrate that the nucleus is astrometrically stable at 8.4  ghz , to an accuracy of @xmath52  mas @xmath0 28  mas @xmath0 15  pc between vla observations spanning both tens of days and 4.1  yr . panels ( c ) and ( d ) verify this stability but with a poorer accuracy of @xmath53  mas @xmath0 35  mas @xmath0 19  pc .",
    "the nucleus is as astrometrically stable at 4.9  ghz as it is at 8.4  ghz , based on comparisons within panels ( b ) and ( d ) .",
    "finally , panels ( e ) and ( f ) imply that the nucleus is astrometrically stable at 8.4  ghz , to an accuracy of @xmath54  mas @xmath0 1.8  mas @xmath0 0.95  pc between vlba observations spanning 13 days and 3.1  yr .      the observed astrometric stability is consistent with any models based on black holes , including adaf and jet models , but an adaf model was ruled out photometrically in section  3.1 . if the reality of the apparent vlba structure in figure  4 could be verified , then those images could be used to constrain the evolution of the lengths of , or features within , any jets or counterjets .",
    "furthermore , if a vlba image was acquired during a radio flare , then the peak in that image would arise from the optically - thick base of the jet and would be expected to be located closer to the black hole .",
    "suppose that the blue luminosity from the seyfert `` nucleus '' of the ngc5548 arises from a compact star cluster .",
    "then the absolute magnitude of the cluster can be equated to the historical minimum of @xmath55  mag recorded for the seyfert nucleus ( @xcite ) .",
    "a star cluster with that magnitude will be characterized by an optical supernova rate of 0.6  yr@xmath10 ( @xcite ) and an effective radius @xmath56  pc @xmath0 42  mas ( @xcite ) .",
    "each new optical supernova event should yield a radio counterpart if sn1988z is indeed as relevant to the starburst models as claimed by terlevich et al .",
    "( 1995 ) .",
    "a circle with the effective radius @xmath57 of the star cluster is shown in panels ( a)-(d ) in figure  9 , with the circle arbitrarily centered at the origin .",
    "figure  9 implies that radio nucleus of ngc5548 does not move with the characteristic step size @xmath57 between supernova events , as predicted by melnick et al .",
    "the strongest constraints follow from the vlba - vlba astrometric stability at the 1-pc level for observations separated by 3.1  yr",
    ". however , in the star cluster model it is the massive stars which are the supernova progenitors , so if the initial mass function is biased toward massive stars and/or mass segregation is occuring , then the radio supernova would occur within a region of radius much smaller than @xmath56  pc @xmath0 42  mas ( @xcite ) .",
    "the optical supernova rate of 0.6  yr@xmath10 for ngc5548 is moderately high , leading to a new supernova event about every 1.7  yr .",
    "this motivates a deep search for secondary radio sources at the matched vlba resolution .",
    "data from vlba epochs 1998.445 and 1998.481 were combined to yield an image with rms @xmath58jy  ba@xmath10 , corresponding to about 100 times the strength of casseopiaa were it placed at the distance of ngc5548 ( @xcite ) .",
    "no secondary sources stronger than @xmath59 , or about 200 times casseopiaa , were found in about 7600 vlba beam areas within an annular region , centered as for figure  9 and with inner radius 10  mas @xmath0 5.3  pc and outer radius 84  mas @xmath0 45  pc @xmath60 .",
    "this outer radius is well within the limitations to the field of view given the vlba observing strategies ( @xcite ) .",
    "the absence of secondary vlba sources , in conjuction with the vlba constraints on the astrometric stability of the radio source , requires the presence of no more than one radio supernova during a 3.1-yr interval .",
    "this condition is improbable if the detected vlba source really is a radio supernova whose slow decline , based on the vlba photometry , is shared by other radio supernovae .",
    "thus either the radio supernova rate is lower than 0.6  yr@xmath10 and/or , as mentioned above , the radio supernovae occur within a region of radius much smaller than @xmath61  pc @xmath0 42  mas .",
    "the vla and vlba were used to monitor the radio continuum counterpart to the optical broad line region ( blr ) in the seyfert galaxy ngc5548 .",

    "the photometric variability and astrometric stability of the radio nucleus is not consistent with star cluster models that treat the blr as a compact supernova remnant and , for ngc5548 , required a new supernova event like sn1988z every 1.7  yr within an effective radius @xmath56  pc .",
    "the radio supernova models for sn1988z can not account for the vla variability observed on time scales of tens of days .",
    "the combined vlba evidence for astrometric stability , no secondary sources , and slow photometric evolution of the detected source mean that the radio supernova rate is lower than predicted and/or the radio supernovae occur within a region much smaller than predicted .",
    "additional vlba monitoring would thus be benefical , to provide further astrometric and photometric constraints on the detected radio source and to continue searches for secondary sources .",
    "the photometric variability and astrometric stability of the radio nucleus in ngc5548 is consistent with models of jets on scales @xmath47  pc emerging from a black hole .",
    "if the subparsec outflow inferred from x - ray / uv absorber models contains relativistic plasma , then the vlba images could be used to trace the shape of the flow on parsec scales .",
    "however , the reality of the apparent vlba structure must first be verified .",
    "tracing flow kinematics to 100  pc should also be feasible through an hst study of the narrow optical emission lines , because those lines are so dominated by gas within 70  pc @xmath0 130  mas from the nucleus ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a deep image at 8.4  ghz with a resolution 350  pc was obtained by adding data from quiescent vla observations .",

    "the northern lobe is edge - brightened , suggesting a bubble - like structure in 3-d .",
    "these lobes are plausibly driven by twin jets or a bipolar wind from the seyfert  1 nucleus .",
    "the kinematics of the flow could be followed to kiloparsec scales if neutral or molecular gas was detected in absorption against the radio continuum lobes .",
