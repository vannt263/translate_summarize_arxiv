    "many theories of galaxy evolution assume that a galaxy s evolutionary stage and its cold gas content are tightly linked .",
    "for example , it is often assumed that a depleted cold gas reservoir can explain why massive galaxies are redder and exhibit less active star formation , but recent observations have challenged this picture by identifying populations of galaxies that contain significant amounts of cold gas despite their low or moderate star formation rates @xcite .",
    "some attempts have been made to systematically search for these galaxies to understand them as a population . in this paper",
    "we pursue this line of reasoning by studying a sample of massive galaxies with an unusual combination of high hi masses and low specific star formation rates .",
    "galaxies that have more cold gas than expected can be placed into two broad categories : red , early - type galaxies with unexpected measurable hi and galaxies that have significantly more hi than their star formation rates ( sfrs ) would suggest . in the first category , early - type galaxies were expected to be devoid of cold gas because they lack the spiral arms that indicate recent star formation . the first systematic imaging search for hi in early - type galaxies , motivated in part by the evidence for hi in individual early - types , found that hi is common at low levels in early - type galaxies in the field and could play an important role in their evolution @xcite .",
    "more recent surveys have revealed that at least 32% of such galaxies have detectable hi and that 20% of etgs have regularly rotating disks of hi @xcite .",
    "@xcite show that even red early - type galaxies have cold gas at detection rates of 10 - 34% and that the detection rates are highest among the most massive ( log m@xmath5/m@xmath1 @xmath2 10.5 ) red early - types .",
    "galaxies in the @xcite sample contain up to 10@xmath6 solar masses of hi .",
    "because galaxies with more than this amount of hi are rare , study of these galaxies has so far focused on individual galaxies rather than entire populations .",
    "galaxies with low rates of star formation compared to their cold gas content comprise a diverse population of not just red early - type galaxies but also massive spirals that are expected to contain cold gas but have a high gas content incommensurate with relatively low sfrs .",
    "the reasons for their low sfrs can be difficult to ascertain .",
    "recent simulations and observations have attempted to determine which physical processes or conditions can prevent cold gas from collapsing and forming stars . in simulations the heating and disruption of gas by agn feedback",
    "are frequently used to explain the low specific star formation rates ( ssfr = sfr / m@xmath3 ) of massive galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite showed that feedback from radio - mode agn can shut down star formation , but it is unclear how this would affect the cold gas reservoir @xcite .",
    "@xcite show that morphological quenching can quench star formation in bulge - dominated galaxies without removing or heating the cold gas .",
    "a high cold gas content may coexist with a low sfr in galaxies such as those with inefficient star formation in their outer disks .",
    "the outer disks could harbor large quantities of gas but observations have shown that their densities are low and typically dominated by hi over h@xmath7 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "inefficient star formation is frequently attributed to a low gas surface density below a threshold level of 3 - 10 m@xmath1 pc@xmath8 that is required for h@xmath7 to form and for star formation to proceed efficiently @xcite . below this threshold level",
    "the sfr surface density decreases steeply ; this downturn could be related to h@xmath9-derived star formation thresholds in outer disks such as those discovered by @xcite .    extended uv ( xuv ) disks and giant low surface brightness galaxies ( glsbs )",
    "are both populations of galaxies characterized by inefficient star formation .",
    "xuv - disks are defined by the presence of low - level uv flux beyond the main stellar disk .",
    "the prevalence of xuv - disks suggests that inefficient star formation in the outer disks of galaxies may be common @xcite , especially around massive , bulge - dominated galaxies @xcite .",
    "glsbs have a less stringent definition than xuv - disks , but are generally known to have low surface brightness disks at optical wavelengths and massive hi disks that extend well beyond the optical radius .",
    "malin 1 @xcite is the prototypical glsb , and several similar galaxies have been discovered ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "simulations have shown that extended low surface density gaseous disks may be common if the cold gas building up the gaseous disk has a high angular momentum @xcite .",
    "it has become clear that cold gas and star formation are not always linked in obvious ways . to gain a deeper understanding of the role hi plays in galaxy evolution , both within the general population and in populations that deviate from the general population",
    ", it is necessary to have large , well - defined samples of galaxies with known star formation and gas properties .",
    "recent large hi surveys such as the galex arecibo sdss survey ( gass ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the arecibo legacy fast alfa survey ( alfalfa ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) complement galex ( galaxy evolution explorer ) and sdss ( sloan digital sky survey ) data on star formation and galactic structure by providing key measurements of the cold gas in galaxies .",
    "the advent of large hi surveys such as these provides the first opportunity for us to select and study volume - limited populations of galaxies defined only by their gas content .    in this paper",
    "we take advantage of these recent hi surveys to assess the link between cold gas and star formation in a unique and systematic way .",
    "although the term cold gas generally refers to both atomic and molecular gas , we only have information about hi so we refer to cold gas and hi interchangeably throughout the rest of the paper except when noted otherwise .",
    "we define a sample of massive ( log m@xmath3/m@xmath1 @xmath2 10.0 ) hi - rich galaxies to investigate the relationship between hi and star formation in this crucial stellar mass range in which galaxies become less actively star - forming .",
    "we uncover an intriguing population of galaxies at stellar masses log m@xmath3/m@xmath1 @xmath2 10.5 that exhibit surprisingly low ssfrs despite their significant amounts of hi .",
    "because the galaxies were selected based on single - dish hi observations with arecibo , there existed no information about the morphology or spatial extent of the hi , which is crucial in determining why much of the hi is not participating in star formation . in this paper",
    "we describe the sample and report on the results of an hi imaging survey at the jansky very large array ( vla ) intended as an observational test of the mechanisms acting to suppress star formation in these massive hi - rich galaxies .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we select a sample of hi - rich galaxies and we compare their star - forming and structural parameters to two control samples .",
    "this section motivates the observational test described in section 3 , in which we obtain hi imaging for massive hi - rich galaxies with suppressed star formation . in section 4",
    "we discuss the implications of our results in terms of star formation suppression mechanisms .",

    "our simple selection criterion , based only on hi mass and stellar mass , defines the hi - rich sample to contain galaxies that have hi gas fractions in the top 5% of the gass distribution . to determine where the top 5% lies , we sort the hi gas fractions , or upper limits on the gas fractions for non - detected gass galaxies , and select the gas fraction that divides the bottom 95% from the top 5% ( fig .",

    "a similar sample could be constructed using results of the bivariate hi mass function @xcite , but we chose this method for simplicity .",
    "although we use gass to establish the criterion for selecting hi - rich galaxies , we select the hi - rich sample from alfalfa , a blind , shallow wide - field hi survey that contains many more hi detections than gass and whose sky footprint overlaps with that of gass . whereas gass provides a complete census of hi in massive galaxies and can be used to derive quantiles of the distribution , alfalfa mainly detects hi - rich galaxies at the redshifts probed by gass and so can not be as easily used to quantify the full range of hi masses for massive galaxies . however , alfalfa is complete over this volume to the hi - rich gas fraction limits considered here and so is useful for selecting a large , unbiased sample of hi - rich galaxies .",
    "we select the hi - rich sample from the @xmath9.40 subsample @xcite . to ensure that the physical parameters for galaxies in the hi - rich and gass samples are measured homogeneously , the hi - rich sample contains only alfalfa galaxies that are also in the gass parent sample ( n=12006 ) .",

    "the latter is consistent with @xcite , who show that the radius enclosing half of the hi flux ( their r50 ) for normal galaxies is comparable to or less than the optical radius ( half of d@xmath19 ) .",
    "first we examine how the sfrs of galaxies in the hi - rich sample vary with stellar mass .",
    "one might naively expect hi - rich galaxies to have uniformly high sfrs . to test this , in figs .",
    "[ fig : gasrich]c , e we plot the gas fractions and ssfrs of the hi - rich galaxies vs. stellar mass .",
    "two distinct results are apparent : 1 ) the ssfrs of the hi - rich galaxies decrease with increasing stellar mass faster than their hi contents decrease ; and 2 ) the scatter in their ssfrs increases with stellar mass , leaving many hi - rich galaxies well below the star - forming sequence ( dashed line ; from @xcite ) at log m@xmath3/m@xmath1 @xmath2 10.5 .",
    "this population is the subject of our study in the next section .",
    "our hi - rich sample contains galaxies that have extreme hi contents _ for their stellar mass _ so their hi fractions necessarily decrease with stellar mass .",
    "but the decreasing gas fraction can not be the sole driver of the decreasing trend in ssfr because the ssfrs decline with a steeper slope ( @xmath20 -1.29 ) . to emphasize that the decreasing ssfrs are characteristic of hi - rich galaxies in general and not just a sample of hi - rich galaxies whose hi gas fractions decrease with stellar mass",
    ", we compare the hi - rich sample to the constant gas fraction sample , whose galaxies have higher - than - average gas fractions within the same narrow range with respect to stellar mass . even though the gas fractions for galaxies in this sample remain constant with respect to stellar mass , their ssfrs decrease in the same way as for the hi - rich sample .",
    "this inconsistent relationship between gas and star formation runs counter to the simple assumption that star formation efficiency ( sfe = sfr / m@xmath0 ) does not vary with stellar mass @xcite and hints that something other than the lower gas fractions in massive hi - rich galaxies contributes to their low ssfrs .",
    "importantly , this result is not just a reflection of the generic trend of decreasing ssfrs vs. stellar mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) because we selected hi - rich galaxies which , by definition , are not representative of the full galaxy population .",
    "thus , the decreasing ssfrs within the hi - rich sample is an unexpected result rather than a confirmation of expectations . that ssfrs decrease with stellar mass even within a sample of galaxies that have extremely high hi contents indicates that gas loss alone can not explain why ssfrs decrease with stellar mass within the larger population . by studying this extreme population of galaxies with high hi fractions and incommensurately low",
    "sfrs , we can gain insight into the star formation suppression mechanisms at work both in hi - rich galaxies and in less extreme form in normal galaxies . fig .",
    "[ fig : gasrich]g , h we show the sfe vs. stellar mass for the two hi - selected samples .",
    "the average sfe for gass galaxies is constant with respect to stellar mass ( dashed line ) but exhibits a large scatter @xcite .",
    "overall the hi - rich sample exhibits sfes lower than the median .",
    "there is also a clear trend for the distribution of sfes to become wider and extend to lower sfes at higher stellar masses , which confirms the increasingly weak relationship between hi and star formation within the hi - rich sample .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig : gasrich]i , j we show the nuv - r color of the samples , which is generally considered a proxy for specific sfr .",
    "indeed , the distributions of nuv - r and specific sfr tell a similar story : at low stellar masses , hi - rich galaxies exhibit a narrow range of colors and lie on the blue sequence , but as stellar mass increase , galaxies become redder and the scatter in color increases .",
    "although the massive hi - rich galaxies have much lower ssfrs than would be expected based on their hi contents , the galaxies do not lie on the red sequence .",
    "they appear to have a low level of residual or recent star formation .",
    "because the two hi - selected samples have different hi properties by definition but produce similar trends in ssfr , there is some ambiguity in the role of the hi .",
    "it is only clear that within this stellar mass and hi gas fraction range , stellar mass is a better predictor of ssfr than is hi content .",
    "a clearer understanding of these trends requires knowledge of the molecular gas as well , which does not exist for this sample , though we discuss the possible relationship between hi and h@xmath7 in this sample below .",
    "we determined that our uv - based sfrs , which can be strongly affected by dust , are not artificially low due to dust attenuation by examining their infrared colors @xcite and d@xmath21(4000 ) , and removing from the sample edge - on galaxies whose uv fluxes are most likely to be attenuated by gas .",
    "the distribution of d@xmath21(4000 ) , a stellar age indicator that correlates with star formation history and is expected to be insensitive to extinction , mimics the distribution of ssfr , confirming the existence of a weaker link between gas fraction and ssfr at higher stellar masses .",
    "although ssfrs for some edge - on galaxies may be underestimated by a factor of  10 , it is unlikely that the decreasing ssfrs with stellar mass are driven by a higher proportion of edge - on galaxies at high stellar masses . to be sure ,",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : gasrich ] that our results hold if we exclude edge - on galaxies from the hi - rich sample .",
    "finally , we note that there is generally more scatter in uv - derived sfr measurements for more massive galaxies ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but it is unlikely to produce the strong trend we see .",
    "the ssfrs of galaxies in the hi - rich sample show that the relationship between hi and star formation varies with stellar mass : at high stellar masses , star formation is suppressed even within galaxies that are hi - rich for their stellar mass . in the next section we describe hi imaging of 20 hi - rich galaxies with low ssfrs .",
    "the resulting hi maps provide insight into the physical conditions that can suppress star formation while maintaining a significant hi reservoir at high stellar masses .",
    "the low ssfrs in some massive hi - rich galaxies suggests that star formation is being suppressed in some massive galaxies _ without the removal of hi_. the high gas fractions and low ssfrs in the most massive galaxies could be a signature of internal suppression of star formation , extended hi disks with surface densities below that required for efficient star formation , or recently accreted gas that has not yet formed stars .",
    "the distribution and surface density of the hi can provide key insight into the physical conditions of the cold gas in the galaxy , which can help us understand why the cold gas is not forming stars .",
    "we obtained followup hi imaging with the jansky very large array ( vla ) for a subset of the hi - rich galaxies to understand the star formation suppression mechanisms at work in these galaxies .",
    "below we describe the galaxies selected for followup , the observations , and the conclusions we can derive from the observations .",
    "galaxies in our hi - rich sample are ideal for followup with the vla because their high hi fluxes ( 1.38 - 8.1 jy km s@xmath22 ) , previously measured at arecibo for the alfalfa survey , ensure they can be easily detected in a short amount of time . from the final hi - rich sample of 258 galaxies we selected 20 galaxies for followup with the vla from the population of galaxies with high hi masses and low ssfrs , i.e. those that deviated from the star - forming sequence at high stellar mass .",
    "the final sample includes all hi - rich galaxies with high stellar masses ( log m@xmath3/m@xmath1 @xmath2 10.6 ) , low ssfrs ( log ssfr @xmath10 -10.75 ) , and moderate - to - high axis ratios ( b / a @xmath2 0.5 ) to avoid edge - on galaxies whose ssfrs might be artificially low due to internal dust attenuation .",

    "they are indicated in fig .",

    "[ fig : sdss ] we display their sdss color images .",
    "one galaxy , gass 11390 , was removed from the sample because the vla observations revealed no hi signal above the level of the noise . in the arecibo spectrum",
    "the galaxy is at the edge of the band , which possibly affected the calculation of the hi mass for alfalfa .",
    "we report on the results of the final sample below , which contains 19 galaxies .",
    "we note that there exist several other ongoing studies of hi - rich galaxies and we wish to distinguish our sample and our goals from theirs .",
    "the bluedisks project , as described in @xcite uses hi maps to understand the origin of the excess hi in galaxies that have high hi gas fractions compared to their predicted gas fractions .",
    "their goal contrasts slightly with our goal , which is to understand why some galaxies with large hi reservoirs do not have high ssfrs .",

    "this image was used to define which 6@xmath256 arcsecond pixels of the original cube should be included in the moment maps .",
    "thus , the final moment maps have 6@xmath256 arcsecond pixels based on the original , unsmoothed data cube .",

    "@xcite calculated the global hi surface density within the stellar disk , but this measurement provides no information about the outer parts of the hi disk since hi disks tend to extend well beyond the optical disks of galaxies .    _ sfr surface density _ we also calculate the sfr surface density in three ways , averaging over the same three regions we used for the hi surface density . to determine the sfr within each region , we scaled the sfr from galex by the fraction of far - uv light contained within the given region , which assumes that the dust correction is uniform across the galaxy .",

    "* ) , but this type of suppression via agn can not explain the large cold gas contents in the hi - rich galaxies .",
    "the buildup of a hot halo that prevents gas accretion can not explain why the cold gas already within the galaxy is stable against star formation , so is not helpful in explaining our results . the third scenario , in which agn feedback disrupts the cold gas enough to prevent it from forming stars , could explain our results and is the scenario we discuss below .    because simulations have only just begun to include a multiphase ism ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , to our knowledge none exist that specifically address how the hi that remains in a galaxy is affected by agn feedback ( though @xcite note that in gas - rich z@xmath42 galaxies agn feedback is not strong enough to disrupt dense clouds of star - forming gas ) .",
    "observational studies of agn hosts with measured hi masses show that hi can remain at high levels in galaxies with agn : @xcite and @xcite show that agn hosts contain just as much hi as do their counterparts without agn .",

    "how , if at all , is the agn affecting the hi reservoir ?",
    "direct observational evidence of this is lacking , but @xcite show how agn feedback prevents the _ molecular _ gas from forming stars in the h@xmath7-luminous radio galaxy 3c 326 n. like the hi - rich galaxies in this paper , 3c 326 n contains a substantial amount of cold gas ( m@xmath36 = 10@xmath37 m@xmath1 ) but a surprisingly low sfr .",
    "they found that mechanical energy from the agn that was injected into the ism heated the molecular gas enough to make it stable against star formation but still detectable as h@xmath7 .",
    "it is possible that a similar mechanism that heats the hi is at work in some of the massive hi - rich galaxies discussed here .",
    "if this is so , hi - rich galaxies with agn should have a lower sfr surface density than comparison galaxies with the same hi surface density . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sflaw2 ] we show that this is indeed the case : galaxies with lower sfr surface densities tend to have evidence of an agn . however , the only true agn in the vla sample are weak , with oiii luminosities less than 10@xmath38 l@xmath1 , so it is unclear if they are powerful enough to affect the large quantities of gas in galaxies in the vla sample .",

    "explain that gas disks embedded in bulge - dominated galaxies may exhibit sfrs a factor of 10 lower than similarly massive gas disks in spiral galaxies for two reasons : bulge - dominated galaxies lack a stellar disk that contributes to the self - gravity of a gas disk and naturally have higher epicyclic frequencies , which can increase the toomre q parameter above the critical value for star formation .",
    "this scenario is also seen in simulations at redshift z@xmath42 @xcite and is supported by observations at z@xmath42 in which star - forming galaxies have higher values of q at their centers where a bulge dominates @xcite . in the local universe , lower hi and h@xmath7 sfes in bulge - dominated galaxies compared to late - type galaxies provide some evidence for morphological quenching @xcite .",

    "@xcite show in the radial profiles of their simulated galaxies that the gas surface density increases to greater than 10@xmath40 m@xmath1 pc@xmath8 at the centers of the galaxies .",
    "the gas in this density regime is likely molecular , which would create a central hole in a map of the hi flux .",
    "some galaxies in the vla sample do exhibit an hi depression in the center .",
    "if galaxies with little hi in their centers do have central h@xmath7 and no sign of central star formation , this could be evidence of morphological quenching .",
    "if the center lacks cold gas altogether , it is unclear if morphological quenching is at work .",
    "h@xmath7 observations of galaxies in the vla sample could bring clarity to this scenario .",
    "since all of the hi - rich galaxies described here have high gas fractions , which @xcite find lower the effect of morphological quenching , and most have low gas surface densities , which according to @xcite heighten the effect of morphological quenching , we can not draw any definitive conclusions about the effect of morphological quenching in our sample except to say that it could be playing a role in the more highly - concentrated galaxies based on the recent simulations and observations demonstrating its effects . in figure",
    "[ fig : sflaw2 ] we identify the hi - rich galaxies based on their concentration index ; there is some evidence that the more bulge - dominated galaxies have lower sfr surface densities at a given hi surface density , though it is unlikely that morphological quenching can affect the very extended gas disks in the vla sample .",
    "morphological quenching is unlikely to play a role in less bulge - dominated galaxies .",
    "inefficient star formation can result from low cold gas surface densities , which can be present in hi - rich galaxies if the hi extends over a large surface area . as noted above , hi disks",
    "generally extend well beyond stellar disks , and this is something we see in the vla sample as well .",
    "galaxies selected by hi tend to be more extended than those that are selected optically @xcite .",
    "extended hi disks will form stars inefficiently only if the disks do not contain substantial amounts of h@xmath7 , the immediate precursor to star formation .",
    "observations confirm that the outskirts of gaseous disks tend to be hi - dominated .",
    "@xcite show that in local spirals , hi extends well beyond the radius at which sfr and h@xmath7 become negligible . in @xcite the molecular fraction , @xmath41/@xmath31 , decreases steadily with radius , and in @xcite the total ( hi + h@xmath7 ) gas surface density profile decreases more quickly than the hi surface density profile .",
    "@xcite shows that extended gas disks tend to be hi - dominated because the transition from the neutral to the molecular phase proceeds efficiently only above a critical gas surface density of 3 - 10 m@xmath1 pc@xmath8 . a critical surface density of 9 m@xmath1 pc@xmath8",
    "is confirmed observationally by @xcite , above which cold gas is mostly molecular .",
    "our observed galaxies have hi surface densities that fall below the critical gas surface density , indicating that the gas disks in the vla sample are likely hi - dominated . where hi dominates over h@xmath7 , star formation necessarily proceeds at a slower rate .",
    "observations show that in the outskirts of galaxies where hi dominates , and in dwarfs that are hi - dominated throughout , the local sfe decreases with radius @xcite . integrated and local measurements show that there is a break in the star formation law such that at gas surface densities below the critical density , galaxies exhibit sfr surface densities a factor of 5 below the extrapolation of the star formation law at higher gas surface densities @xcite .",
    "@xcite show that this downturn , which is equivalent to a lowering of the sfe at low gas surface densities , agrees with work by @xcite and @xcite predicting lower h@xmath7 fractions in low surface density gas .",
    "the galaxies in the vla sample lie in the part of the star formation law in which star formation is least efficient .",
    "thus , the low ssfrs in the galaxies in the vla sample are reasonable given their hi surface densities .    for the phenomenon of extended , low surface density hi disks to be common , the extended hi disks must be long - lived .",
    "simulations have shown that extended low surface density gaseous disks may result when galaxies accrete from the igm cold , dense filaments , which have higher angular momenta than the dark matter halo and prevents efficient gas transport to the disk @xcite . a more likely scenario for the massive galaxies in the vla sample , which might not accrete gas directly from cold filaments in the igm ,",
    "is described in @xcite .",
    "they show that extended gas disks with hi surface densities below the critical density for star formation can result when the gas disks are built up by gas cooling from large radii within the hot halo .",
    "populations of galaxies in the local universe that are defined by inefficient outer star formation include glsbs and xuv - disks .",
    "galaxies in the vla sample might be analogs of glsbs : in fig .",
    "1 we show that glsbs and the vla sample lie in the same region of the hi gas fraction - stellar mass plane .",
    "the prevalence of xuv - disks @xcite confirms that inefficient star formation in extended disks is common .",
    "galaxies in the vla sample are probably not xuv - disks ( except for 45664 ) because their uv images do not show evidence of recent star formation within the extended hi , but galaxies in the vla sample and xuv - disks might represent different stages of the life of an extended hi disk .      if galaxies in our sample recently accreted cold gas , it is possible that the gas simply hasnt been in the galaxy long enough to collapse and form stars .",
    "@xcite show that it generally takes 0.5 gyr for the cosmic sfr to react to new gas accretion . to determine whether this scenario could account for the high hi masses and low sfrs of galaxies in our sample , we must consider , first , whether we expect galaxies at this mass scale to be accreting gas and at what rate , and , second , whether we see any evidence of recent accretion in the optical images and hi maps .",
    "simulations have shown that the ways in which galaxies accrete gas depend on their mass , environment , and redshift .",
    "at z@xmath40 , gas that is accreted onto galaxies above a critical halo mass is shock heated to the virial temperature and likely stays warm @xcite .",
    "gas that is accreted onto galaxies below the critical halo mass tends to enter a galaxy in the form of cold streams from the igm .",
    "depending on the precise way in which one relates halo mass to baryonic mass , this critical mass could lie just below the stellar mass at which many hi - rich galaxies with low sfrs are found .",
    "thus , galaxies like those in our sample are probably accreting gas that is shock - heated and it is unclear whether that will ultimately cool into hi .    for recent accretion to account for the large amount of excess hi in our hi - rich galaxies",
    ", we would expect to see large tidal features indicative of major accretion events in the hi maps or optical imaging .",
    "we do not see any obvious signatures of accretion events in the vla sample and the hi maps suggest that galaxies in the vla sample have regularly rotating , settled disks .",
    "gass 45664 is the possible exception , with an hi distribution whose peak is offset from the stellar disk .",
    "the regions with the strongest hi emission exhibit prominent spiral arms , but other regions with significant hi do not have signs of star formation .",
    "this combination of uv - bright features embedded in an extended hi disk that does not show signs of star formation elsewhere suggests that we are seeing this galaxy in the process of re - building its stellar disk after a major accretion event .    in this initial study of hi morphologies",
    ", we can not assess the distribution and kinematics of the hi at the level done by @xcite because our observations do not have the required depth .",
    "that type of analysis could reveal lesser accretion events based on the presence of gas at anomalous velocities , but such lesser accretion events are unlikely to yield the high hi masses in the vla sample .",
    "it appears that much of the cold gas in galaxies in the vla sample has been retained as the galaxies evolved since there is no evidence that major episodes of accretion brought in large amounts of cold gas .",
    "the results of our analysis of hi - rich galaxies in section 2 are twofold : 1 ) that a population of hi - rich galaxies with surprisingly low ssfrs exists , and 2 ) that this population primarily exists above a stellar mass of log m@xmath5 = 10.5 .",
    "hi imaging allows us to understand the suppression of star formation in these galaxies .",
    "a separate question is why galaxies with an excess of hi compared to their sfrs become common above a threshold stellar mass .",
    "some evidence exists to show that as stellar mass increases , not only do ssfrs decrease , but so does the efficiency with which galaxies convert their cold gas into stars .",
    "@xcite show that cold gas ( hi or h@xmath7 ) content up to 10@xmath37 m@xmath1 does not measurably affect the uv - optical colors of massive ( log m@xmath5 @xmath2 10.7 ) galaxies .",
    "they also find that less massive early - type galaxies with cold gas are blue while more massive early - type galaxies with measurable cold gas are red .",
    "even when massive galaxies have significant amounts of h@xmath7 , which is one step closer to forming stars than hi , they are unlikely to form stars at a high rate .",
    "although the hi - based sfe is constant with respect to stellar mass @xcite , the h@xmath7-based sfe decreases as stellar mass increases @xcite .",
    "@xcite show that massive galaxies have older single stellar population ages than less massive galaxies with the same h@xmath7 fraction .",
    "together , these findings present a picture in which the most massive galaxies do not form stars even if they have the cold gas necessary to do so .",
    "a significant hi mass compared to sfr could be a sign that a galaxy is lacking h@xmath7 and is suffering from inefficient conversion from hi to h@xmath7 .",
    "@xcite suggest this is why their hi - selected sample has lower sfes than an optically selected sample",
    ". an abundance of hi compared to h@xmath7 might be more common in more massive bulge - dominated galaxies .",
    "@xcite find that the detection rate of hi and h@xmath7 drops significantly among more bulge - dominated galaxies and that above these detection thresholds , galaxies have mostly hi if they have any cold gas at all .",
    "similarly , red galaxies are more likely to be detected in hi than h@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "@xcite measure the h@xmath7 in 28 hi - rich galaxies with stellar masses and hi masses similar to those for our sample . 15 out of 20 normal galaxies and 4 out of 8 lsb galaxies were detected .",
    "their high h@xmath7 contents place them at the high end of the h@xmath7 gas fraction distribution shown in @xcite , but their cold gas reservoirs are still dominated by hi over h@xmath7 by a factor of 2 to 3 . although our sample was selected differently from theirs to include only hi - rich galaxies with low ssfrs , there is still no evidence that hi - rich galaxies in general are molecular - dominated .",
    "although we do not have h@xmath7 measurements for the vla sample , we assume based on the results of @xcite and on the low ssfrs in these galaxies that they do not contain significant quantities of h@xmath7 . what , then , is hindering the conversion from hi to h@xmath7 in massive galaxies ?",
    "@xcite predict that a high spin parameter @xmath42 ( usually associated with more massive galaxies ) is related to less efficient hi - to - h@xmath7 conversion .",
    "@xcite show that at a given stellar mass , galaxies with higher hi fractions are in dark matter halos with higher spin parameters , which probably means that they are more extended since their halos have higher angular momenta .",
    "although this phenomenon is no longer obvious at stellar masses above m@xmath3 @xmath4 10.5 , @xcite generally find that hi - selected galaxies reside in halos with high spin parameters and are more extended .",
    "if massive hi - rich galaxies tend to have more extended hi disks than is typical , then the conversion from hi to h@xmath7 must be weak because much of the gas lies beyond the radius at which the conversion proceeds efficiently @xcite .",
    "we used two recent large hi surveys , gass and alfalfa , to define and select a sample of massive galaxies ( log m@xmath5/m@xmath1 @xmath2 10 ) that are extremely hi - rich for their stellar mass .",
    "the hi - rich galaxies have hi fractions in the top 5% for their stellar mass and have hi masses greater than 10@xmath6 m@xmath1 . within the hi - rich sample",
    ", we examined the relationship between hi and star formation as a function of stellar mass .",
    "we found that even though the hi fractions of the hi - rich galaxies decrease with stellar mass , their ssfrs decrease at a stronger rate .",
    "this trend of decreasing ssfrs revealed a sample of hi - rich galaxies with surprisingly low ssfrs at the high end of the stellar mass range ( log m@xmath5/m@xmath1 @xmath2 10.5 ) .    to understand the physical conditions producing this unexpected combination of very high hi masses and lower ssfrs , we obtained hi maps at the vla of 20 of these galaxies .",
    "the hi maps yield the distribution of the hi along with the extent and surface density of the hi within the hi disk .",
    "we found that the hi surface densities are low enough that the galaxies fall in the region of the @xmath32-@xmath31 plane in which inefficient star formation is common . in this regime",
    ", a narrow range of hi surface densities can yield a wide range of sfr surface densities .    because the hi surface densities for the galaxies in the vla sample are low , their low ssfrs are not unexpected .",
    "but other conditions , including the internal structure of the galaxies , could also contribute to their low ssfrs .",
    "we found that galaxies with the lowest sfr surface densities are more likely to be bulge - dominated and exhibit stronger evidence of agn .",
    "however , because bulge - dominated galaxies are generally more likely to host agn , it is unclear whether the agn or the structure of the galaxy ( in the form of morphological quenching ) is contributing to the suppression of star formation .",
    "future observations of the molecular gas in these galaxies could provide some insight .",
    "a more detailed morphological analysis of the hi akin to that in @xcite could also provide some clues , but the distances to these galaxies coupled with the short integration times of the observations described here make that type of work less robust .",
    "it is not obvious that the same star formation suppression mechanisms must operate in other types of galaxies with less hi , but it is worth considering how these results might apply to other populations of galaxies with low ssfrs .",
    "since all of the galaxies in the vla sample have low hi surface densities , there is no strong evidence that high concentration index or agn are driving the low ssfrs , but they seem to be contributing .",
    "as we have shown , ascertaining the driving factor behind suppressed star formation is not straightforward even when maps of the cold gas are available .",
    "nevertheless , it could be worth examining in further detail how the hi distributions and hi surface densities vary with stellar mass within populations of galaxies with less cold gas to see if the same conditions apply in less extreme galaxies .",
    "of course some massive galaxies have low ssfrs because they lack the cold gas necessary for star formation to proceed , but we have shown that star formation drops with stellar mass even among populations of galaxies that have extremely high quantities of hi , so other conditions must be at work in the broader population .    although galaxies in the vla sample appeared to challenge the star formation law with their unexpected combination of high hi masses and low ssfrs , the sample actually conforms to the global star formation law .",
    "we have shown that the star formation law is an important tool for understanding the relationship between gas and star formation in galaxies that appear to be outliers .",
    "placing other atypical galaxies , such as xuv - disks , glsbs , or galaxies transitioning between the red and blue sequences , on the @xmath32-@xmath31 plane could improve our understanding of these important populations .",
