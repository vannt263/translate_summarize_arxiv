    "<S> we investigate properties of exponential operators preserving the particle number using combinatorial methods developed in order to solve the boson normal ordering problem . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we apply generalized dobiski relations and methods of multivariate bell polynomials which enable us to understand the meaning of perturbation - like expansions of exponential operators . </S>",
    "<S> such expansions , obtained as formal power series , are everywhere divergent but the pad summation method is shown to give results which very well agree with exact solutions got for simplified quantum models of the one mode bosonic systems .    </S>",

    "<S> of the eqn.([3 ] ) as a power series in @xmath4 and using the definition of the coherent states we arrive at @xmath21 from which one reads out the formula @xmath22 giving for @xmath23 the dobiski relation @xmath24 eqns . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 8 ] ) and ( [ 9 ] ) connect sequences of polynomials @xmath25 or positive integers @xmath26 with sums of nontrivial series of fractions and allow to represent the bell polynomials as the stieltjes moments of an infinite sum of weighted @xmath27-functions , called the _ dirac comb _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath28 following the above considerations we can generalize our results to arbitrary @xmath29 in which @xmath30 polynomially depend on @xmath2 . </S>",

    "<S> these series are divergent because the coefficients @xmath40 grow with @xmath17 much faster than @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> such an asymptotic behavior is seen from eqns.([12 ] ) - the latter imply that the numbers @xmath44 include the standard stirling numbers of the second kind @xmath45 and , as a consequence , the polynomials @xmath40 include polynomials @xmath46 . </S>",

    "<S> eqns.([15 ] ) and ( [ 16 ] ) imply that the multivariate bell polynomials satisfy , for @xmath65 and @xmath66 arbitrary constants , the homogeneity relation @xmath67 a particular case of the multivariate bell polynomials are polynomials being coefficients of taylor - maclaurin expansions of @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> they generalize the standard hermite polynomials and for some special cases have simple analytic forms @xcite , @xcite - among them the two variable hermite  kamp de friet polynomials @xmath69 : @xmath70 h_n^{(m)}(g_1,{g_{m}})=n!\\displaystyle\\sum_{r=0}^{[n / m ] } \\frac{g_1^{n - mr}g_{m}^r}{(n - mr)!r!}\\ , , \\end{array}\\ ] ] and the three - variable hermite polynomials @xmath71 : @xmath72 h_n(a , b , c)=n!\\displaystyle\\sum_{r=0}^{[n/3 ] } \\frac{c^{r}h_{n-3r}^{2}(a , b)}{(n-3r)!r!}\\ , . </S>",
    "<S> \\end{array}\\ ] ]    as an illustration of the presented approach let us consider diagonal coherent state matrix element @xmath73 . expanding the exponential as power series in @xmath74 , next using ( [ 18 ] ) , ( [ 19 ] ) and definition of the coherent states we arrive at @xmath75 the operational relation @xmath76 enables us to rewrite the eqn.([20 ] ) as @xmath77 replacing @xmath78 by their moment representation ( [ 10 ] ) and changing the integration and summation order we obtain the perturbation expansion of @xmath79 in terms of the power series in the coupling constant @xmath80 @xmath81 because of the asymptotic behavior @xmath82 , this series , as well as the series ( [ 20 ] ) , both have zero radii of convergence being however asymptotic expansions of @xmath83 in order to give them analytical meaning one has to use methods of generalized summation . </S>",
    "<S> numerical check using the pad method ( see fig.1 - 2 , below ) shows that even low order approximants of series ( [ 20 ] ) and ( [ 23 ] ) give very good agreement with exact result calculated from ( [ 24 ] ) for g belonging to the domain much larger than the domain in which partial sums of both series give acceptable results . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , comparing these results we in fact compare results given by the pad method with exact solutions for simplified , nevertheless essentially quantum , model . </S>",
    "<S> this confirms practical utility of the pad summation method applied to various perturbation expansions occurring in quantum physics even if we are unable to prove its applicability in a mathematically satisfactory way . </S>",
    "<S> it also confirms that generating functions obtained as solutions to the boson normal ordering problem and being in general divergent formal series may be interpreted as asymptotic expansions , resumed in such a generalized sense and , as a consequence , used in physical applications . </S>"
