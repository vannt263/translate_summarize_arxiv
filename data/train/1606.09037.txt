    "recent research of astrophysical and connected optical phenomena related to possible direct observations of effects occuring in the field of black holes and naked singularities , or other strong gravity compact objects , is often concentrated in effects occuring in the modified kerr geometry implied by alternatives to the einstein gravity .",
    "observable effects related to these modified kerr geometries could give signatures of the alternatives or extensions of the standard einstein gravity , or of the influence of non - vacuum environment of the compact objects .",
    "the modifications of the kerr geometry can be separated into two classes .    in the first class ,",
    "modifications of the kerr ( or schwarschild ) geometry are related to a concrete modification of the standard einstein gravity .",
    "there is a large variety of research related to the braneworld models @xcite , standard gravity combined with the non - linear electrodynamics giving regular black holes or no - horizon spacetimes @xcite , hoava quantum gravity @xcite , string theory @xcite , f(r ) gravity @xcite , kerr geometry modified by the cosmological constant @xcite , or quintessential fields @xcite , higher - dimensional spacetimes @xcite .    in the second class ,",
    "the kerr geometry is modified in the framework of the so called dirty kerr geometry @xcite , where the modifications are usually unrelated to any source term .",
    "the kerr ( schwarzschild ) vacuum solution of the einstein equations is considered as an etalon of these studies , and its metric coefficients are correspondingly modified . in the dirty kerr geometry framework ,",
    "the radial profiles of the metric coefficients are modified and effects of the modified metric on the optical phenomena are studied @xcite .",
    "recently , ghasemi - nodehi and bambi proposed a new version of modified kerr geometry , where also the latitudinal profiles of the metric coefficients can be modified @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the geometry modifications are related to all terms of the kerr metric containing mass @xmath2 and specific angular momentum ( spin ) @xmath3 .",
    "however , there could exist also modifications of the kerr metric that are not related to the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "here we briefly study a concrete case of such a spacetime , related to the quintessential rotating black holes .    here",
    "we concentrate attention to a special class of the quintessential kerr black holes generating modification of the kerr geometry that represents an extension of the seemingly most general class of modifications of the kerr geometry introduced in @xcite .",
    "the considered modification of the kerr geometry occurs due to a special ( limit ) class of the quintessential field .",
    "recently , toshmatov , stuchlik and ahmedov @xcite have found an axially symmetric stationary non - vacuum solution of the einstein equations where the energy - momentum tensor corresponds to the quintessential scalar fields .",
    "the quintessential field is characterized by the equation - of - state parameter @xmath4 , and by the dimensionless parameter @xmath1 representing intensity of the quintessential field .",
    "the quintessential kerr ( schwarzschild ) geometry demonstrates repulsive gravity at large distances , and implies existence of the cosmological horizon @xcite .",
    "however , in the limit case of @xmath5 , the quintessential kerr geometry becomes the asymptotically flat kerr geometry - the geometry is modified by the quintessential field parameter @xmath1 , but the dependence of the metric coefficients on the mass and spin parameters , @xmath6 , remains to be of the standard kerr character .    here",
    "we study the black hole silhouette shape , and the profile of the spectral lines of radiation from the inner parts of the keplerian disks for the special limit ( @xmath0 ) of the quintessential kerr metric , in dependence on the parameter @xmath1 .",
    "both these phenomena are fully governed by the geodesic structure of the quintessential kerr spacetime .",
    "the geometry of the quintessential rotation black hole spacetime introduced in @xcite is described in the standard boyer - lindquist coordinates and the geometric units with @xmath7 by the line element @xmath8 with @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the gravitational mass and the specific angular momentum @xmath14 of the black hole , @xmath15 is the quintessential scalar field equation - of - state parameter , while @xmath16 is the quintessential field parameter characterizing the field magnitude . when the quintessential field parameter @xmath17 , the rotating quintessential geometry reduces to the kerr geometry .",
    "the related quintessential field energy - stress tensor is also determined in @xcite , but only the spacetime geometry will be relevant in our study .    in the case of the special limit of the quintessential kerr black holes , determined by the equation of state parameter @xmath0 , the line element of the geometry simplifies to the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 and the mass parameter is put for simplicity to @xmath20 , i.e. , we express the spin and quintessential field parameter @xmath1 as dimensionless quantities , and we use dimensionless radial and time coordinates @xmath21 .",
    "the special ( @xmath0 ) quintessential kerr metric clearly represents an extension of the ghasemi - nodehi  bambi modification of the kerr geometry , as it modifies also the @xmath22 term in the expression @xmath23 governing the loci of the black hole event horizons .",
    "in contrast to the quintessential black hole spacetimes with @xmath4 , having a cosmological horizon , the special case of the @xmath0 spacetimes is asymptotically flat .",
    "the horizons are given by the relation @xmath24 now the limit on the black hole spin reads @xmath25 and it breaks the standard black hole bound of @xmath26 .",
    "we study simple optical effects in this special quintessential rotating black hole geometry in order to demonstrate the role of this kind of the kerr geometry modifications .",
    "it is convenient in numerical simulations to use the reciprocal radial coordinate @xmath27 and the latitudinal coordinate @xmath28 .",

    "there are two constants of the motion related to the spacetime symmetries : energy @xmath35 , connected with the stationarity , axial angular momentum @xmath36 , connected with the axial symmetry .    for the special quintessential rotating black hole geometry , given by the line element ( [ line_element ] )",

    "notice that the latitudinal motion is governed by the same equation as in the kerr geometry , but the equation of the radial motion is modified due to the presence of the quintessential field .",
    "we illustrate the effect of the special quintessential rotating black hole geometry on the profiled spectral line of the radiation originating in the keplerian disks assumed to be composed of the test particle emitters following the stable circular orbits with so called keplerian angular frequency .",
    "therefore , we first discuss the circular geodesics and their stability .",

    "studies of the astrophysical phenomena in the field of black holes ( or alternative strong gravity objects ) , based on the modified geometry only , can give very important basical information , but they have to be considered very carefully , as additional effects related to the origin of the modified gravity , or the source terms hidden behind the dirty kerr geometry , could significantly alter the predictions based on the purely geometrical considerations .",
    "here we have considered some optical phenomena around the special quintessential kerr geometry  the direct influence of the quintessential field on the optical phenomena is irrelevant and it enters the play only throung the resulting geometry .",
    "the modifications of both the black hole silhouette and the profile of the spectral line are determined by the functions @xmath53 and @xmath54 which reflect the departure of the particular quantities determined in the specific rotating quintessential metric relative to those determined in the kerr metric .",
    "we have clearly demonstrated that in the limiting quintessential field with equation - of - state parameter @xmath0 , the resulting geometry of rotating black holes leads , in the case of the characteristic values of the quintessential field parameter @xmath17 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 , to significant and specific modifications of the silhouette shape and the profile of the spectral lines generated in the innermost parts of keplerian disks .    for the black hole silhouette we have found that the parameter @xmath57 increases with the parameter @xmath1 increasing , enlarging the silhouette .",

    "in the case of the spectral line profiles we obtained significant shift of the profiled lines to the red end , the shift increases with increasing parameter @xmath1 .",
