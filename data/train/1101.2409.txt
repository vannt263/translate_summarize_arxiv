    "quantum error correction ( qec ) is a theoretical scheme developed in quantum computing to defend quantum coherence against environmental noise .",
    "there are different methods for preserving quantum coherence .",
    "one possible technique exploits the redundancy in encoding information .",
    "this scheme is known as `` quantum error correcting codes '' ( qeccs ) . for a comprehensive introduction to qeccs",
    ", we refer to @xcite . within such scheme",
    ", information is encoded in linear subspaces ( codes ) of the total hilbert space in such a way that errors induced by the interaction with the environment can be detected and corrected .",
    "the qecc approach may be interpreted as an active stabilization of a quantum state in which , by monitoring the system and conditionally carrying on suitable operations , one prevents the loss of information . in detail , the errors occur on a qubit when its evolution differs from the ideal one .",
    "this happens by interaction of the qubit with an environment .",
    "another possible approach is the so - called noiseless codes ( also known as decoherence free subspaces ( dfss ) or error avoiding codes ) . for a comprehensive introduction to dfss",
    ", we refer to @xcite .",
    "it turns out that for specific open quantum systems ( noise models in which all qubits can be considered symmetrically coupled with the same environment ) , it is possible to design states that are hardly corrupted rather than states that can be easily corrected ( in this sense , dfss are complementary to qeccs ) . in other words , it is possible to encode information in linear subspaces such that the dynamics restricted to such subspaces is unitary .",
    "this implies that no information is lost and quantum coherence is maintained .",
    "dfs is an example of passive stabilization of quantum information .    the formal mathematical description of the qubit - environment interaction is usually given in terms of quantum channels .",
    "quantum error correction is usually developed under the assumption of i.i.d .",
    "( identically and independently distributed ) errors .",
    "these error models are characterized by memoryless channels @xmath5 such that @xmath6-channel uses is given by @xmath7 .",
    "in such cases of complete independent decoherence , qubits interact with their own environments which do not interact with each other .",
    "however , in many physical situations , qubits do interact with a common environment which unavoidably introduces correlations in the noise .",
    "for instance , there are situations where qubits in a ion trap set - up are collectively coupled to their vibrational modes @xcite . in other situations , different qubits in a quantum dot design are coupled to the same lattice , thus interacting with a common thermal bath of phonons @xcite .",
    "the exchange of bosons between qubits causes spatial and temporal correlations that violate the condition of error independence @xcite .",
    "memory effects then arise among channel uses with the consequence that @xmath8 .",
    "recent studies try to characterize the effect of correlations on the performance of qeccs @xcite .",
    "it appears that correlations may have negative @xcite or positive @xcite impact on qeccs depending on the features of the error model being considered .    a part from being correlated",
    ", noise errors may also be asymmetric .",
    "most of the quantum computing devices @xcite are characterized by relaxation times ( @xmath9 ) that are one - two orders of magnitude larger than the corresponding dephasing times ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "relaxation leads to both bit - flip and phase - flip errors , whereas dephasing ( loss of phase coherence ) only leads to phase - flip errors .",
    "such asymmetry between @xmath9 and @xmath11 translates to an asymmetry in the occurrence probability of bit - flip ( @xmath12 ) and phase - flip errors ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath14 is known as the channel asymmetry .",
    "quantum error correction schemes should be designed in such a way that no resources ( time and qubits ) are wasted in attempting to detect and correct errors that may be relatively unlikely to occur .",
    "quantum codes should be designed in order to exploit this asymmetry and provide better performance by neglecting the correction of less probable errors @xcite .",
    "indeed , examples of efficient quantum error - correcting codes taking advantage of this asymmetry are given by families of codes of the calderbank - shor - steane ( css ) type ( asymmetric stabilizer css  codes ) @xcite .",
    "devising new good quantum codes for independent , correlated and asymmetric noise models is a highly non trivial problem .",
    "however , it is usually possible to manipulate in a smart way existing codes to construct new ones suitable for more general error models and with higher performances @xcite .",
    "concatenation is perhaps one of the most successful quantum coding tricks employed to produce new codes from old ones .",
    "the concept of concatenated codes was first introduced in classical error correcting schemes by forney @xcite .",
    "roughly speaking , concatenation is a method of combining two codes ( an inner and an outer code ) to form a larger code . in classical error correction ,",
    "forney has carried on extensive studies of concatenated codes , how to choose the inner and outer codes , and what error probability threshold values can be achieved .",
    "the first applications of concatenated codes in quantum error correction appear in @xcite .",
    "in the quantum setting , concatenated codes play a key role in fault tolerant quantum computation and in constructing good degenerate quantum error correcting codes .",
    "obviously enough , the choice of a code depends on the error model .",
    "however , in selecting a code rather than another , one should take into account their performance on the error model .",
    "since there is no single quantity holding all information on a code , different quantum code performance quantifiers have appeared into the qec literature nielsen - book .",
    "for instance , in @xcite it is suggested that the entanglement fidelity @xcite is the important quantity to maximize in schemes for quantum error correction . in @xcite , it is proposed that the code entropy is an important quantitative measure of the quantum correction schemes by determining a hierarchical structure in the set of protected spaces @xcite .",
    "motivated by all the above mentioned considerations , in this work we study the properties of error correcting codes for noise models in the presence of asymmetries and/or correlations by means of the entanglement fidelity and the code entropy .",
    "first , we consider a dephasing markovian memory channel and characterize the performance of both a repetition code and an error avoiding code ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively ) in terms of the entanglement fidelity .",
    "we also consider the concatenation of such codes ( @xmath2 ) and show that it is especially advantageous in the regime of partial correlations .",
    "finally , we characterize the effectiveness of the codes @xmath1 , @xmath0 and @xmath15 by means of the code entropy .",
    "we show that the effort required for recovering such codes decreases when the error probability decreases and/or the memory parameter increases .",
    "second , we consider an asymmetric depolarizing noisy quantum memory channel and perform quantum error correction via the five qubit stabilizer code @xmath4 \\right ] } $ ] .",
    "we characterize this code by means of the entanglement fidelity and the code entropy as function of the asymmetric error probabilities and the degree of memory .",
    "specifically , we uncover that while the asymmetry in the depolarizing errors does not affect the entanglement fidelity of the five qubit code , it becomes a relevant feature when quantifying the code performance by means of the code entropy .",
    "the layout of this article is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present few theoretical tools employed in the rest of the article .",
    "in particular , we emphasize the conceptual and operational meanings of the entanglement fidelity and code entropy , the two code performance quantifiers employed here . in section iii ,",
    "we study a dephasing markovian memory channel and characterize the performance of both a repetition code and an error avoiding code ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively ) in terms of the entanglement fidelity .",

    "finally , we characterize the effectiveness of the codes @xmath1 , @xmath0 and @xmath16 by means of the code entropy . in section iv , we analyze both symmetric and asymmetric depolarizing noisy quantum memory channels and perform quantum error correction via the five qubit stabilizer code @xmath4 \\right ] } $ ] .",
    "we characterize this code by means of the entanglement fidelity and the code entropy as function of the asymmetric error probabilities and the degree of memory .",
    "we find , among other things , that while asymmetric depolarizing errors do not affect the entanglement fidelity of the five qubit code , they do affect its code entropy .",
    "a summary of the uncovered results and our comments on the usefulness of both the entanglement fidelity and code entropy as suitable code performance quantifiers for the error models considered appear in section v.",
