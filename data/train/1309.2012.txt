    "in recent years there have been a slew of textbooks  @xcite , review articles  @xcite , and lecture notes  @xcite designed either as an introduction to numerical relativity , or as a convenient place to understand the state of the art of the field , not to mention classic texts on time evolution problems  @xcite .",
    "these resources already serve their purpose beautifully .",
    "so , happy as i was to be asked to teach introductory material and provide written lecture notes , the obvious question is ; does the world need another set of introductory notes to hyperbolic systems ?",
    "i ve tried to come to a solution that presents the heart - and - soul of the topic as concisely as possible . in this class",
    "i will review concepts in the analysis of time - evolution partial differential equations , pdes , proving results only sparsely .",
    "the main aim is to collect together , in the form of a tool - box , the necessary weapons for treating a given system of pdes .",
    "i hope that where i have shamelessly copied , the authors of existing texts will accept my imitation as flattery . in the second lecture",
    "i treat electromagnetism as a model for general relativity , and apply each of the tools to demonstrate how they are used in practice .",
    "i expect that this application will be enlightening .",
    "i highlight the effect of gauge freedom on the pdes analysis , for a large family of gauges . to my knowledge",
    "such a treatment has not appeared elsewhere , although free - evolution formulations of electromagnetism have of course been studied in the literature  @xcite .    in physics and",
    "applied mathematics we are frequently presented with systems of pdes .",
    "well - posedness is a fundamental property of a pde problem .",
    "it is the requirement that there be a unique solution that depends continuously , in some norm , on given data for the problem . without it ,",
    "one has simply not built a reasonable mathematical abstraction of the physical problem at hand .",
    "the model is without predictive power , because small changes in the given data might result in either arbitrarily large changes in the outcome or that there is no solution at all .",
    "if we are given a complicated system , like the field equations of general relativity , we will probably have to find solutions numerically .",
    "but if the formulation as a pde problem is ill - posed , _ no _ numerical approach can be successful !",
    "afterall , how can one construct an approximation scheme that converges to the continuum solution if the solution does nt exist ?",
    "therefore one might find it surprising that research in numerical relativity has been performed with problems that are ill - posed . spontaneously on hearing",
    "that such versions of general relativity exist , you might think that this sounds a bit like a way of saying that the theory is broken , or somehow deficient .",
    "that impression is wrong .",
    "the answer is that for theories with gauge freedom , the precise formulation of the field equations as a system of pdes affects well - posedness . and it took time for this fact to be recognized in the context of numerical relativity . in the second lecture we will carefully investigate this for electromagnetism .    the most crude way of classifying a pde is into one of the three classes , elliptic , parabolic or hyperbolic , names originally inspired by the conic - sections .",
    "the class of a pde determines what type of data has any chance of producing a well - posed problem . from the intuitive point of view of the physicist",
    ", one might summarize their character as follows :    _ elliptic pdes _ have no intrinsic notion of time , and often arise as the steady - state , or end - state solutions of dynamical evolution , for example in electrostatics .",
    "the solutions to well - posed elliptic problems are typically `` as smooth as the coefficients allow '' .",
    "the prototype of a well - posed elliptic problem is the boundary value problem for the laplace equation .",
    "_ parabolic pdes _ describe diffusive processes .",
    "they have an intrinsic notion of time , but signals travel at infinite speed . even non - smooth initial data immediately become smooth as they evolve .",
    "the prototype of a well - posed parabolic problem is the initial value problem for the heat equation .",
    "_ hyperbolic pdes _ are the best .",
    "they describe processes which are in some sense causal ; there is an intrinsic notion of time , and crucially signals travel with _",
    "finite _ speed .",
    "discontinuities in initial data for a hyperbolic pde will often be propagated , or may even form from smooth initial data .",
    "the prototype of a well - posed hyperbolic problem is the initial value problem for the wave equation .",
    "notice that all of the prototype well - posed problems specify both a simple pde , the type of data , and the domain that is appropriate .",
    "one can also concoct pdes of mixed character , so this classification is certainly not complete .",
    "numerical relativists have to face all three , and occasionally mixed classes .",
    "but in this lecture we will focus exclusively on hyperbolic problems and well - posedness of the initial , and initial boundary value problems .",
    "_ the initial value problem : _ consider a system of pdes , which can be written , @xmath0 with state vector  @xmath1 . here",
    "i employ the summation convention , denote @xmath2 , and assume that  @xmath3 .",
    "the highest derivative terms are called the principal part .",
    "i will sometimes refer to  @xmath4 as the principal matrix , although it is really a shorthand for three matrices , since i m assuming that we have three spatial dimensions .",
    "the remaining terms on the right - hand - side of   are called non - principal . in this lecture",
    "we will assume that the matrices  @xmath4 and  @xmath5 are constant in both time and space .",
    "we therefore call it a _ linear , constant coefficient system_. the initial value , or cauchy problem , is the following : specify data  @xmath6 at time  @xmath7 , with spatial coordinates  @xmath8 . what is the solution  @xmath9 at later times ?",
    "in other words data is specified _ everywhere _ in space ; the domain of the solution is in this sense unbounded .",
    "naturally many pdes of interest are not linear or do not have constant coefficients .",
    "that said , local properties of more complicated systems are determined by the behavior of the system in linear approximation , which justifies the restriction .",
    "_ well - posedness : _ if there exist constants  @xmath10 and  @xmath11 , such that for all initial data we have the estimate , @xmath12 norm , @xmath13 then the initial value problem for   is called well - posed .",
    "notice that we restrict to initial data that are bounded in  @xmath14 .",
    "_ strong hyperbolicity : _ given an arbitrary unit spatial vector  @xmath15 , we say that the matrix @xmath16 is the principal symbol of the system .",
    "the system   is called weakly hyperbolic if for every unit spatial vector  @xmath15 , the principal symbol has real eigenvalues .",
    "if furthermore for every unit spatial vector  @xmath15 , the principal symbol has a complete set of eigenvectors and there exists a constant  @xmath10 , independent of  @xmath15 , such that @xmath17 is formed with the eigenvectors of  @xmath18 as columns , and we have the usual definition of the matrix norm  @xmath19 , the system is called strongly hyperbolic . if a system is strongly hyperbolic and the multiplicity of the eigenvalues does not depend on  @xmath15 we say that it is strongly hyperbolic of constant multiplicity .",
    "notice that if the eigenvectors of the principal symbol depend continuously on  @xmath15 then the second condition   is automatically satisfied , because  @xmath15 varies over a compact set . in most applications we will have continuous dependence , and",
    "so checking for strong hyperbolicity amounts to doing a little linear algebra .    _",
    "characteristic variables : _ the components of the vector  @xmath20 are called the characteristic variables in the  @xmath15 direction . up to non - principal terms and derivatives",
    "transverse to the  @xmath15 direction the characteristic variables satisfy advection equations with speeds equal to the eigenvalues of the principal symbol . for this reason we will sometimes call the eigenvalues the speeds of the system . to see this",
    "consider , @xmath21 here  @xmath22 has the eigenvalues of the principal symbol on the diagonal , we denote longitudinal derivatives  @xmath23 , and transverse derivatives  @xmath24 by an upper case latin index  @xmath25 .",
    "_ well - posed  @xmath26 strongly hyperbolic : _ the main result for the initial value problem for   is that it is well - posed if and only if the system is strongly hyperbolic .",
    "we will need to fourier transform in space , and use the convention , @xmath27 the time derivative of the variables after fourier transform is , @xmath28 where we write  @xmath29 .",
    "so in fourier space the general solution is @xmath30 assume that the system is strongly hyperbolic .",
    "the key to the proof of well - posedness is the use of a symmetrizer .",
    "we define the hermitian , positive definite symmetrizer  @xmath31 by , @xmath32 which satisfies the crucial property , @xmath33 note that our choice for the definition of  @xmath31 is not the most general that yields  ; instead we could have chosen  @xmath34 , with  @xmath35 hermitian , positive definite , and commuting with  @xmath22 .",
    "we do not require the most general @xmath31 here , and so make do with this restriction .",
    "define the norm  @xmath36 by , @xmath37 computing the time derivative of the norm  @xmath36 , a couple of lines gives the inequality , @xmath38 and integrating we have the well - posedness estimate , in the new norm  @xmath36 , latexmath:[\\ ] ] i leave it as an exercise for you to convince yourself that this is really a boundary condition on some combination of the electric and magnetic fields , actually @xmath262 in the terminology of teukolsky  @xcite .",
    "laplace - fourier transforming the boundary conditions and substituting the general solution into them , we can solve for the constants  @xmath255 and obtain the solution @xmath263 at the boundary  @xmath62 , where now i ve abandoned most of the shorthands so that you can see how it really looks .",
    "all that remains is to show that each of the variables is bounded in  @xmath264 and  @xmath47 , which i leave as an exercise , but point you towards  @xcite which shows the necessary estimates on all of the terms present here .",
    "the essential point is that we do nt have to worry about the numerators in any of the fractions , because they are obviously bounded , and since the real part of  @xmath132 is positive , terms like  @xmath265 appearing in the denominators are bounded away from zero . recalling that by construction  @xmath257 corresponds directly to constraint violation , and noting that , @xmath266 it is clear that the constraint preserving boundary conditions work when  @xmath260 is chosen .",
    "these calculations are largely performed in the mathematica notebook maxwell_lf.nb which accompanies the lecture . with the lorenz gauge ,  @xmath204 , well - posedness",
    "can be shown for constraint preserving boundary conditions using the energy method  @xcite with a special choice of symmetrizer , or alternatively with the kreiss - winicour cascade approach  @xcite . to my knowledge",
    "this is the first time that boundary stability has been demonstrated for arbitrary hyperbolic gauge conditions inside the family  .      in this lecture",
    "we looked at different formulations of electromagnetism suitable for free - evolution .",
    "we saw that for every strongly hyperbolic pure gauge , we could build a formulation which was itself strongly hyperbolic .",
    "we saw furthermore that system is system is symmetric hyperbolic for all of these gauge choices .",
    "working then in the high - frequency frozen coefficient approximation , we used the laplace - fourier method to investigate boundary stability with constraint preserving boundary conditions .",
    "some parts of the calculations were not very explicitly presented . to understand the ins - and - outs i recommend that you study the mathematica notebooks in tandem with the lecture notes .",
    "they are available at the school s website  @xcite .",
    "some of the calculations presented in this lecture used the mathematica package _ xtensor _",
    "@xcite for abstract tensor calculations .",
    "i would like to thank the organizers of the nrhep2 school for giving me the rewarding opportunity to present these lectures .",
