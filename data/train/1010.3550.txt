    "they attribute this to the fraction of molecular gas in dense clouds .",

    "hizoa  j0836 - 43 appears unusual in the local universe as an hi - massive lirg .",
    "however , many galaxies have large reservoirs of hi  that are not currently being converted into stars , and will indeed lie dormant unless the density threshold of neutral gas is exceeded , enabling molecular clouds to form and subsequently collapse .",
    "a recent event has likely triggered the current starburst , whereas similarly extreme hi - massive disks observed in the local universe remain quiescent .",
    "this could be due to a combination of their rarity and the ` catch 22 ' situation that the low density environment that has preserved them @xcite has also left them bereft of suitable triggers .",
    "we could speculate as to how hizoa  j0836 - 43 formed its huge gas disk ",
    "the possibility that it is the product of a gas - rich merger of two galaxies , or due to accretion of cold gas from the intergalactic medium  and the effect of nurture due to its environment ( explored further in paper iii ) .",
    "but , irrespective of its origin , we are observing inside - out stellar disk - building in a gas - dominated galaxy , with minimal contamination from an agn .",
    "if this galaxy mimics the pristine , early evolution of a gas disk , so critical to our understanding of the complex systems that subsequently form , hizoa  j0836 - 43 could provide a singular opportunity for studying a star formation mechanism ( at @xmath20 ) , which is pervasive in the @xmath268 universe .",
    "in this paper we have presented the results of our _ spitzer _ infrared and molecular gas observations of hizoa j08360 - 43 .",
    "we summarise here the main findings :    * the galaxy spectrum appears dominated by strong , extended pah emission with @xmath232 in the nuclear region increasing to @xmath233 for a region including the inner disk ( measured using a spline continuum ) .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath234 ratio of @xmath235 ( nuclear ) to @xmath236 ( nuclear+inner disk ) . * in strong contrast , however , the dust 24  continuum appears intrinsically weak compared to other starburst systems and ( u)lirgs , resembling that of an `` average '' disk galaxy . using the synthetic 24  flux ,",
    "integrated from the nuclear region spectrum , corresponds to @xmath228/@xmath178 of @xmath12 1.3 .",
    "this paucity of emission from warm dust ( indicating a lack of emission from very small grains ) is seen independently in the galaxy s photometry . *",
    "compared to lirgs with similar infrared luminosity ( @xmath6=10@xmath7 ) , the pahs in hizoa  j0836 - 43 are on average @xmath122 times stronger , whereas the warm dust continuum ( @xmath8 ) is best fit by a star forming galaxy with @xmath6=10@xmath9 .",
    "* the combination of strong pah emission and relatively weak continuum places hizoa  j0836 - 43 in the extreme pdr - dominated region of the mir diagnostic diagram of peeters et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , similar to the reflection nebula ngc 7023 .",
    "we speculate that the absence of a substantial warm dust continuum may be due to the dust geometry in a gas - rich disk , as the star formation appears strongly extended across a region of @xmath350 kpc and not severely embedded . *",
    "the @xmath45neiii@xmath46$]15.56/@xmath45neii@xmath46$]12.81  ratio indicates a typical radiation field strength compared to other starbursting systems and the electron density of @xmath139 ( from the @xmath45siii@xmath46\\ , 18.71$]/@xmath45siii@xmath46\\ , 33.48 $ ]  ratio ) is also normal for disk systems .",
    "the @xmath45siii@xmath46$]34.82/@xmath45siii@xmath46$]33.48  ratio suggests strong pdr emission compared to emission from hii  regions .",
    "* we determine a lower limit for the molecular gas content of the galaxy ( @xmath124@xmath11 ) ; the corresponding gas mass fraction is @xmath1264% , comparable to the @xmath14 galaxies ( @xmath1257% ) and far above the average of 20% for local spirals .",

    "the combination of sfr and stellar mass suggests that it would be considered typical at a redshift of @xmath19 and its stage of active building , given its gas supply , appears analogous to these distant systems .",
