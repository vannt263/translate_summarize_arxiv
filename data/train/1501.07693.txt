    "branching brownian motion ( bbm ) is a well - known model that finds applications in several areas of science including physics , mathematics and biology .",
    "bbm arises naturally in the context of systems where new particles are generated at each time step such as models of evolution , epidemiology , population growth and nuclear reactions , and now has a long history @xcite .",
    "in addition , bbm has also been widely used in theoretical physics where it has been studied in the context of reaction - diffusion models , disordered systems amongst others @xcite .",
    "bbm is also an important model in probability theory as it combines the long - studied diffusive motion with the random branching mechanism of galton - watson trees @xcite . in this paper",
    "we are interested in one dimensional bbm .",
    "the process begins with a single particle at the position @xmath21 at time @xmath22 .",
    "the dynamics proceeds in continuous time , where in a small time interval @xmath23 , each particle splits into two independent particles with probability @xmath24 , dies with with probability @xmath25 , and with the remaining probability @xmath26 performs a brownian motion on a line with a diffusion constant @xmath3 .",
    "a realization of the dynamics of such a process is shown in fig .",
    "[ walk_picture ] .    , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the maximum and minimum displacements of the process up to a certain time @xmath2 respectively .",
    "]    in a given realization of this bbm process , there are in general @xmath27 particles present in the system at a particular time @xmath2 . the parameters @xmath5 and @xmath4 in this bbm model define three regimes with different properties .",
    "the number of particles @xmath28 is a random variable whose statistics depends on @xmath4 and @xmath5 . when the rate of birth is greater than the death rate ( @xmath29 ) , the _ supercritical _ phase , the process is explosive and the average number of particles in the system grows exponentially with time @xmath30 .",
    "in contrast , when the birth rate is smaller than the death rate ( @xmath31 ) , the _ subcritical _ phase , the process eventually dies and , on an average , there are no particles present in the system as @xmath32 . at the critical point @xmath33 ,",
    "the system is characterized by a fluctuating number of particles with @xmath34 at all times @xmath2 .",
    "if one takes a snapshot of the system at a given time @xmath2 , the spatial positions of the existing particles happen to be strongly correlated , since the particles are linked by their common genealogy .",
    "one important object that has been extensively studied is the order statistics of these particles , i.e. , the statistics of the position @xmath35 of say the @xmath36-th rightmost particle at time @xmath2 , where the particle positions on the line are ordered as @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "another related interesting quantity is the gap @xmath38 between the @xmath36-th and @xmath39-th particle at time @xmath2 .",
    "most of these studies have thus focused on extreme value questions at a given time @xmath2 .",
    "however , there are other interesting extreme value observables that concern the history of the process over the entire time interval @xmath40 $ ] . for instance",
    ", one can consider the global maximum , @xmath41 $ ] which represents the maximum of all the particle positions _ up to _ time @xmath2 .",
    "this has the simple interpretation as the maximum displacement of the entire process up to time @xmath2 ( see fig .",
    "[ walk_picture ] )",
    ". this global maximum has appeared in a variety of applications including the spread of gene populations  @xcite and the propagation of animal epidemics in two dimensions @xcite .",
    "similarly the global minimum @xmath42 $ ] is another interesting quantity that , by symmetry , has the same marginal probability distribution function ( pdf ) as @xmath43 .",
    "the marginal pdf of @xmath7 has been studied extensively for the supercritical @xcite , critical and the subcritical phases @xcite . while the marginal distributions of @xmath7 , and hence that of @xmath44 , are well studied , much less is known about the correlation between these two random variables . in this paper , we study the joint pdf of @xmath7 and @xmath8 . in the supercritical phase , this joint pdf is always time dependent , and is hard to compute analytically . however , in this case , @xmath7 and @xmath8 get separated from each other ballistically in time and hence become uncorrelated at late times .",
    "in contrast , in the critical and subcritical phases ( @xmath6 ) , we show that the joint pdf reaches a limiting stationary form at late times , which we compute analytically .",
    "moreover , for @xmath45 , our exact results for the stationary joint pdf demonstrate that this correlation between @xmath7 and @xmath8 remains finite even in the stationary state .",
    "the joint pdf of @xmath7 and @xmath8 has the following interesting physical application .",
    "for instance , in the context of epidemic spreads , it is important to characterize the spatial extent over which the epidemic has propagated up to time @xmath2 .",
    "this is clearly measured by the span @xmath46 of the process up to time @xmath2 ( see fig .",
    "[ walk_picture ] ) @xcite . evidently , to compute the distribution of @xmath47",
    ", we need to know the joint pdf of @xmath7 and @xmath8 . in this paper",
    "we also compute analytically the stationary pdf of the span @xmath47 in the critical ( @xmath48 ) and the subcritical ( @xmath49 ) cases .",
    "our exact results demonstrate that the correlation between @xmath7 and @xmath8 is also manifest in the stationary span pdf .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we define the model precisely and summarize our main results . in section iii we derive an exact evolution equation for the joint distribution of @xmath7 and @xmath8 . in section",
    "iv we derive the stationary joint pdf of @xmath7 and @xmath8 for the critical ( @xmath48 ) and the subcritical ( @xmath49 ) cases . in section",
    "v we compute the stationary pdf of the span and extract its asymptotic behaviors analytically . in section vi we compare our analytical predictions with monte carlo simulations . finally , we conclude with a discussion in section vii .",
