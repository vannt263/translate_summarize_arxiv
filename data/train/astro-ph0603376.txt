    "the month of october 2005 , in which the fifth protostars and planets meeting was held , marked two important events in the brief history of the observational study of planets orbiting nearby , sun - like stars .",
    "first , it was the ten - year anniversary of the discovery of 51  pegb ( _ mayor and queloz _ , 1995 ) , whose small orbital separation implied that similar hot jupiters could be found in orbits nearly co - planar to our line of sight , resulting in mutual eclipses of the planet and star .",
    "second , october 2005 heralded the discovery of the ninth such transiting planet ( _ bouchy et al .",
    "_ , 2005a ) .",
    "this select group of extrasolar planets has enormous influence on our overall understanding of these objects : the 9 transiting planets are the only ones for which we have accurate estimates of key physical parameters such as mass , radius , and , by inference , composition .",
    "furthermore , precise monitoring of these systems during primary and secondary eclipse has permitted the direct study of their atmospheres . as a result ,",
    "transiting planets are the only ones whose physical structure and atmospheres may be compared in detail to the planets of the solar system , and indeed october 2005 was notable for being the month in which the number of objects in the former category surpassed the latter .    our review of this rapidly - evolving field of study proceeds as follows .",
    "in  2 , we consider the physical structure of these objects , beginning with a summary of the observations (  2.1 ) before turning to their impact on our theoretical understanding (  2.2 ) . in  3 , we consider the atmospheres of these planets , by first summarizing the challenges to modeling such systems (  3.1 ) , and subsequently reviewing the detections and upper limits , and the inferences they permit (  3.2 ) .",
    "we end by considering the future prospects (  4 ) for learning about rocky planets beyond the solar system through the detection and characterization of such objects in transiting configurations .",
    "_ 2.1.1 .  introduction . _ when a planet transits , we can accurately measure the orbital inclination , @xmath0 , allowing us to evaluate the planetary mass @xmath1 directly from the minimum mass value @xmath2 determined from radial - velocity observations and an estimate of the stellar mass , @xmath3 .",
    "the planetary radius , @xmath4 , can be obtained by measuring the fraction of the parent star s light that is occulted , provided a reasonable estimate of the stellar radius , @xmath5 , is available . with the mass and radius in hand",
    ", we can estimate such critically interesting quantities as the average density and surface gravity .",
    "hence , the information gleaned from the transiting planets allows us to attempt to unravel the structure and composition of the larger class of extrasolar planets , to understand formation and evolution processes ( including orbital evolution ) , and to elucidate physical processes that may be important in planetary systems generically .",
    "1 shows the mass - radius relation for the 9 known transiting planets , with jupiter and saturn added for comparison .",
    "it is fortunate that the present small sample of objects spans a moderate range in mass and radius , and appears to contain both a preponderance of planets whose structure is fairly well described by theory , as well as a few oddities that challenge our present knowledge .",
    "we begin by describing how the objects shown in fig .",
    "1 were identified and characterized , and , along the way , we illuminate the limitations that these methods imply for our efforts to understand extrasolar planets as a class . by definition , transiting planets have their orbits oriented so that the earth lies nearly in their orbital plane .",
    "this is an uncommon occurrence ; assuming random orientation of planetary orbits , the probability that a planet with orbital eccentricity , @xmath6 , and longitude of periastron , @xmath7 , produces transits visible from the earth is given by @xmath8\\ ] ] which is inversely proportion to @xmath9 , the orbital semi - major axis .",
    "all known transiting planets have orbital eccentricities consistent with zero , for which the last factor in the above equation reduces to unity .",
    "the radii of jovian planets are typically only about 10% of the stellar radii .",
    "the transits known to date result in a @xmath10 diminution of the stellar flux reaching the earth .",
    "these transits last for @xmath11 hours , and accurate ground - based characterizations of these events are challenging .",
    "the paucity and subtlety of the transits make it necessary to use great care to reduce the random errors and systematic biases that plague the estimation of the planets fundamental properties (  2.1.4 ) .",
    "+ _ 2.1.2 .",
    "methods of detection . _",
    "the presently - known transiting planets have all been detected by one of the two following means , both foreseen by _ struve _",
    "( 1952 ) : ( 1 ) photometric detection of transit - like events , with subsequent confirmation of planetary status via radial - velocity measurements , and ( 2 ) radial - velocity detection of a planet with subsequent measurement of photometric transits .",
    "radial velocity detection has the advantage that the planetary nature of the target object is generally unambiguous .",
    "its disadvantage is that it requires substantial observing time on large telescopes to identify each planetary system , and only then can the relatively cheap process of searching for photometric transits begin .",
    "direct photometric transit searches simultaneously monitor large numbers of stars in a given field of view , but suffer from a very high rate of astrophysical false positives (  2.1.3 ) .",
    "successful photometric transit searches have so far adopted one of two basic strategies , using either moderate - sized or very small telescopes to search either fainter or brighter stars .",
    "five transiting planets ( ogle - tr-10b , 56b , 111b , 113b , and 132b ) have been detected by the optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle ) survey ( _ udalski et al .",
    "_ , 2002a , 2002b , 2002c , 2003 , 2004 ) , which uses a 1.3  m telescope .",
    "the parent stars of these planets are faint ( typically @xmath12 ) .",
    "the large - telescope follow - up observations needed to verify their planetary status , to measure the stellar reflex velocities , and to estimate the planetary masses and radii have been conducted by several groups ( _ bouchy et al .",
    "_ , 2004 , 2005b ; _ dreizler et al .",

    "_ , 2004a , 2004b , 2005 ) .",
    "the trans - atlantic exoplanet survey ( tres ) employed a network of 3 automated small - aperture ( 10  cm ) , wide - field ( @xmath13 ) telescopes ( _ brown and charbonneau _ , 2000 ; _ dunham et al .",
    "_ , 2004 ; _ alonso _ , 2005 ) to detect the planet tres-1 ( _ alonso et al .",
    "_ , 2004 ; _ sozzetti et al .",
    "_ , 2004 ) .",
    "its parent star ( @xmath14 ) is significantly brighter that the ogle systems , but fainter than the transiting - planet systems detected by radial - velocity surveys ( below ) . because of this relative accessibility",
    ", tres-1 has also been the subject of intensive follow - up observations , as detailed later in this review .",
    "numerous other photometric transit surveys are active at the current time .",
    "the best ( _ rauer et al . _ , 2005 ) , hat ( _ bakos et al . _ , 2004 ) , kelt ( _ pepper et al . _ , 2004 ) , superwasp ( _ christian et al . _ , 2005 ) , vulcan ( _ borucki et al . _ , 2001 ) , and xo ( _ mccullough et al . _ ,",
    "2005 ) surveys , and the proposed pass ( _ deeg et al .",
    "_ , 2004 ) survey all adopt the small - aperture , wide - field approach , whereas the explore ( _ mallen - ornelas et al . _ , 2003 ) project employs larger telescopes to examine fainter stars .",
    "the benefits of surveying stellar clusters ( _ janes _ , 1996 ; _ pepper and gaudi _ , 2005 ) have motivated several surveys of such systems , including explore / oc ( _ von braun et al .",
    "_ , 2005 ) , pisces ( _ mochejska et al . _ , 2005 , 2006 ) , and stepss ( _ burke et al .",
    "_ , 2004 ; _ marshall et al .",
    "_ , 2005 ) .",
    "an early , stunning null result was the _",
    "hst _ survey of 34,000 stars in the globular cluster 47  tuc , which points to the interdependence of the formation and migration of hot jupiters on the local conditions , namely crowding , metallicity , and initial proximity to o and b stars ( _ gilliland et al .",
    "_ , 2000 ) .",
    "finally , three transiting planets were first discovered by radial - velocity surveys .",
    "these include hd  209458b , the first transiting planet discovered ( _ charbonneau et al .",
    "_ , 2000 ; _ henry et al .",
    "_ , 2000 ; _ mazeh et al . _ , 2001 ) , and the two most recently discovered transiting planets , hd  149026b ( _ sato et al . _ , 2005 ) and hd  189733b ( _ bouchy et al . _ , 2005a ) .",
    "the latter two objects were uncovered by quick - look radial - velocity surveys targeted at identifying short - period planets of metal - rich stars ( respectively , the n2k survey , _ fischer et al .",
    "_ , 2005 ; and the elodie metallicity - biased search , _ da silva et al .",
    "_ , 2006 ) .",
    "given the preference of radial - velocity surveys for bright stars , it is not surprising that all three systems are bright ( @xmath15 ) , making them natural targets for detailed follow - up observations .",
    "as we shall see below , hd  209458b has been extensively studied in this fashion .",
    "similar attention has not yet been lavished on the other two , but only because of their very recent discovery . + _ 2.1.3 .",
    "biases and false alarms .",
    "_ photometric transit surveys increase their odds of success by simultaneously observing as many stars as possible .",
    "hence , their target starfields are moderately to extremely crowded , and the surveys must therefore work near the boundary of technical feasibility .",
    "the constraints imposed by the search method influence which kinds of planets are detected .",
    "photometric transit searches are strongly biased in favor of planets in small orbits , since such objects have a greater probability of presenting an eclipsing configuration (  2.1.1 ) .",
    "moreover , most transit searches require a minimum of 2 ( and usually 3 ) distinct eclipses to be observed , both to confirm the reality of the signal , and to permit an evaluation of the orbital period . since larger orbits imply longer orbital periods and fewer chances for transits to occur , small orbits are preferred for transit surveys with only a limited baseline .",
    "this is frequently the regime in which single - site surveys operate .",
    "however , multi - site surveys that monitor a given field for several months ( e.g.  hat , tres ) frequently achieve a visibility ( the fraction of systems of a given period for which the desired number of eclipse events would be observed ) nearing 100% for periods up to 6  days . as a result",
    ", such surveys do not suffer this particular bias , although admittedly only over a limited range of periods .",
    "similarly , a stroboscopic effect can afflict single - site surveys , favoring orbital periods near integer numbers of days and may account for the tendency of the longer - period transiting planet periods to clump near 3 and 3.5 days ( _ pont et al .",
    "_ , 2004 , _ gaudi et al .",
    "_ , 2005 ) .",
    "this situation occurs if the campaign is significantly shorter in duration than that required to achieve complete visibility across the desired range or orbital periods .",
    "however , for observing campaigns for which more than adequate phase coverage has been obtained , the opposite is true , and periods near integer and half - integer values are disfavored .",
    "the limiting example of this situation would be a single - site campaign consisting of thousands of hours of observations , which nonetheless would be insensitive to systems with integer periods , if their eclipses always occur when the field is below the horizon .",
    "most field surveys operate in a regime limited by the signal - to - noise of their time series ( which are typically searched by an algorithm than looks for statistically - significant , transit - like events , e.g.  _ kovcs et al . _ ,",
    "2002 ) , and for which the number of stars increases with decreasing flux ( a volume effect ) .",
    "an important detection bias for surveys operating under such conditions has been discussed by _",
    "pepper et al .  _",
    "( 2003 ) and described in detail by _",
    "gaudi et al .  _",
    "( 2005 ) , _ gaudi _ ( 2005 ) , and _ pont et al .  _",
    "these surveys can more readily detect planets with shorter periods and larger radii orbiting fainter stars , and since such stars correspond to a large distance ( hence volume ) they are much more numerous . as a result , any such survey will reflect this bias , which can not be corrected merely by improving the cadence , baseline , or precision of the time series ( although improving the latter will reduce the threshold of the smallest planets that may be detected ) .",
    "most ongoing transit surveys are plagued by a high rate of candidate systems displaying light curves that precisely mimic the desired signal , yet are not due to planetary transits .",
    "we can divide such false positives into three broad categories : some are true _",
    "statistical _ false positives , resulting from selecting an overly - permissive detection threshold whereby the light - curve search algorithm flags events that result purely from photometric noise outliers ( _ jenkins et al .",
    "_ , 2002 ) .",
    "the second source is _ instrumental _ , due to erroneous photometry , often resulting from leakage of signal between the photometric apertures of nearby stars in a crowded field .",
    "however , the dominant form , which we shall term _ astrophysical _ false positives , result from eclipses among members of double- or multiple - star systems .",
    "grazing eclipses in binary systems can result in transit - like signals with depths and durations that resemble planetary ones ( _ brown _ , 2003 ) , and this effect is especially pronounced for candidate transits having depths greater than 1% .",
    "( for equal - sized components , roughly 20% of eclipsing systems have eclipse depths that are less than 2% of the total light . ) in these cases the eclipse shapes are dissimilar ( grazing eclipses produce v - shapes , while planetary transits have flat bottoms ) , but in noisy data , this difference can be difficult to detect .",
    "a false alarm may also occur when a small star transits a large one ( e.g. , an m - dwarf eclipsing a main - sequence f star ) .",
    "since the lowest - mass stars have jupiter radii , it is not surprising that such systems mimic the desired signal closely : they produce flat - bottomed transits with the correct depths and durations .",
    "larger stars eclipsing even larger primaries can also mimic the desired signal , but a careful analysis of the transit shape can often reveal the true nature of the system ( _ seager and mallen - ornelas _ , 2003 ) .",
    "other useful diagnostics emerge from careful analysis of the light curve outside of eclipses",
    ". these can reveal weak secondary eclipses , periodic variations due to tidal distortion or gravity darkening of the brighter component , or significant color effects .",
    "any of these variations provides evidence that the eclipsing object has a stellar mass as opposed to a planetary mass ( _ drake _ , 2003 ; _ sirko and paczyski _ , 2003 ; _ tingley _ , 2004 ) . in the absence of these diagnostics , the stellar nature of most companions",
    "is easily revealed by low - precision ( 1  @xmath16 ) radial velocity measurements , since even the lowest - mass stellar companions cause reflex orbital motions of tens of @xmath16 ( for examples , see _ latham _ , 2003 ; _ charbonneau et al .",
    "_ , 2004 ; _ bouchy et al . _ , 2005b ;",
    "_ pont et al . _ , 2005 )",
    ".    the most troublesome systems are hierarchical triple stars in which the brightest star produces the bulk of the system s light , and the two fainter ones form an eclipsing binary . in such cases ,",
    "the depths of the eclipses are diluted by light from the brightest member , and often radial velocity observations detect only the bright component as well . given neither radial velocity nor photometric evidence for a binary star",
    ", such cases can easily be mistaken for transiting planets .",
    "correct identification then hinges on more subtle characteristics of the spectrum or light curve , such as line profile shapes that vary with the orbital period ( _ mandushev et al .",
    "_ , 2005 ; _ torres et al .",
    "_ , 2004b , 2005 ) , or color dependence of the eclipse depth ( _ odonovan et al .",
    "_ , 2006 ) .",
    "because of the large preponderance of false alarms over true planets , it is only after all of the above tests have been passed that it makes sense to carry out the resource - intensive high - precision radial - velocity observations that establish beyond question that the transiting object has a planetary mass .",
    "+        _ 2.1.4 .  determining the radii and masses .",
    "_ after transiting planets are identified , an arsenal of observing tools is available ( and necessary ) for their characterization .",
    "an accurate estimate of @xmath1 requires precise radial - velocity measurements ( from which the orbital elements @xmath17 , and @xmath7 are also determined ) , as well as an estimate of @xmath3 .",
    "the former are gathered with high - dispersion echelle spectrographs fed by large telescopes . for bright parent stars ,",
    "precision of a few @xmath18 ( compared to reflex orbital speeds of @xmath19 ) can be obtained with convenient exposure times , so that uncertainties in the velocity measurements do not dominate the estimate of @xmath1 . in this regime ,",
    "the greatest source of uncertainty is the value of @xmath3 itself .",
    "given the difficulty of estimating the ages of field stars , comparison with grids of stellar models ( e.g.  _ girardi et al .",
    "_ , 2002 ) suggests that mass estimates are likely to be in error by as much as 5% .",
    "this uncertainty could be removed by measuring the orbital speed of the planet directly .",
    "several efforts have sought to recover the reflected - light spectrum of the planet in a series of high - resolution stellar spectra spanning key phases of the orbital period , but have achieved only upper limits ( _ charbonneau et al .",
    "_ , 1999 ; _ collier cameron et al .",
    "_ , 2002 ; _ leigh et al .",
    "_ , 2003a , 2003b ) .",
    "( these results also serve to constrain the wavelength - dependent planetary albedo , a topic to which we shall return in  3.2.2 . ) for faint parent stars , the radial - velocity estimates become more expensive and problematic , and contribute significantly to the final error budget for @xmath1 .",
    "interestingly , the most intractable uncertainty concerning masses of non - transiting planets , namely the value of @xmath20 , is exquisitely well - determined by fits to the transit light curve .",
    "analysis of moderate - precision light curves ( obtained with ground - based telescopes ) nonetheless yield a tight constraint on the ratio @xmath21 .",
    "however , fits to such data exhibit a fundamental degeneracy amongst the parameters @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath0 , whereby the planet and stellar radii may be reduced in proportion so as to preserve the transit depth , and the orbital inclination may be correspondingly increased so as to conserve the chord length across the star . the uncertainty in @xmath4 is typically dominated by such degeneracies .",
    "determining the value of @xmath4 requires fitting eclipse curves ( facilitated by the analytic formulae of _ mandel and agol _ , 2002 ) subject to independent estimates of @xmath3 , @xmath5 , and the stellar limb - darkening coefficients .",
    "if sufficient photometric precision can be achieved , the value of @xmath5 may be derived from the light curve itself .",
    "this results in a reduced uncertainty on the value of @xmath4 , due to its weaker dependence on @xmath3 , ( @xmath22 ; see _ charbonneau _ ( 2003 ) . for illustrative examples of the degeneracies that result from such fits ,",

    "such data have permitted a simultaneous fit that yields estimates of @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath0 , and the stellar limb - darkening coefficients , thus reducing the number of assumed parameters to one : @xmath3 . _",

    "further improvements can result from the simultaneously fitting of multi - color photometry under assumed values for the stellar - limb darkening , which serves to isolate the impact parameter ( hence @xmath0 ) of the planet s path across the star and break the shared degeneracy amongst @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath0 ( _ jha et al .",

    "_ transiting planets give us the opportunity to test our understanding of the physical structure of giant planets . in particular , structural models of the known transiting planets must be able to account for the wide range of radiation fluxes to which these planets are subjected , and they must recover the observed range of radii .",
    "in general , as the planetary mass decreases , a given external energy input has an increasingly larger influence on the size and interior structure of the planet . for hot jupiters , the absorbed stellar flux creates a radiative zone in the subsurface regions that controls the planetary contraction , and ultimately dictates the radius .",
    "models of transiting giant planets straddle the physical characteristics of brown dwarfs and low - mass stars , as well as the solar system giants ( for an overall review , see _ burrows et al .",
    "_ , 2001 ) .",
    "the construction of structural models for giant planets is difficult because a number of key physical inputs are poorly constrained .",
    "this situation holds equally for extrasolar planets and for the exquisitely observed outer planets of the solar system .",
    "a benefit of robust determinations of the parameters for a growing range of planets is that uncertain aspects of the theory can become increasingly constrained .",
    "indeed , transit observations have the potential to clarify some of the core questions regarding giant planets .",
    "the dominant uncertainty regarding the overall structure of gas giants is in the equation of state ( see the review of _ guillot _ , 2005 ) .",
    "the interiors of solar system and extrasolar giant planets consist of partially degenerate , partially ionized atomic - molecular fluids ( _ hubbard _ , 1968 ) .",
    "the pressure , @xmath39 , in the interiors of most giant planets exceeds 10  mbar , and central temperatures range from @xmath40 for uranus and neptune to @xmath41 for objects such as hd  209458b .",
    "this material regime lies beyond the point where hydrogen ionizes and becomes metallic , although the details of the phase transition are still uncertain ( _ saumon et al . _ , 2000 ; _ saumon and guillot _ , 2004 ) .",
    "the equation of state of giant planet interiors is partially accessible to laboratory experiments , including gas - gun ( _ holmes et al . _ , 1995 ) , laser - induced shock compression ( _ collins et al . _ , 1998 ) , pulsed - power shock compression ( _ knudson et al . _ , 2004 ) , and convergent shock wave ( _ boriskov et al . _ , 2003 ) techniques .",
    "these experiments can achieve momentary pressures in excess of 1  mbar , and they appear to be approaching the molecular to metallic hydrogen transition . unfortunately , these experiments report diverging results .",
    "in particular , they yield a range of hydrogen compression factors relevant to planetary cores that differ by @xmath42 .",
    "furthermore , the laboratory experiments are in only partial agreement with first - principles quantum mechanical calculations of the hydrogen equation of state ( _ militzer and ceperley _ , 2001 ; _ desjarlais _ , 2003 ; _ bonev et al .",
    "_ , 2004 ) , and uncertainties associated with the equations of state of helium and heavier elements are even more severe ( _ guillot _ , 2005 ) .",
    "at present , therefore , structural models must adopt the pragmatic option of choosing a thermodynamically consistent equation of state that reproduces either the high- or low - compression results ( _ saumon and guillot _ , 2004 ) .",
    "another uncertainty affecting the interior models is the existence and size of a radial region where helium separates from hydrogen and forms downward - raining droplets .",
    "the possibility that giant planet interiors are helium - stratified has non - trivial consequences for their structures , and ultimately , their sizes . in the case of saturn ,",
    "the zone of helium rain - out may extend all the way to the center , possibly resulting in a distinct helium shell lying on top of a heavier element core ( _ fortney and hubbard _ , 2003 ) .",
    "uncertainties in the equation of state , the bulk composition , and the degree of inhomogeneity allow for a depressingly wide range of models for the solar system giants that are consistent with the observed radii , surface temperatures , and gravitational moments .",
    "in particular ( _ saumon and guillot _ , 2004 ) , one can construct observationally - consistent models for jupiter with core masses ranging from @xmath43 , and an overall envelope heavy - element content ranging from @xmath44 .",
    "this degeneracy must be broken in order to distinguish between the core accretion ( _ mizuno _ , 1980 ; _ pollack et al .",
    "_ , 1996 ; _ hubickyj et al . _ , 2004 ) and gravitational instability ( _ boss _ , 1997 , 2000 , 2004 ) hypotheses for planet formation .",
    "fortunately , the growing dataset of observed masses and radii from the transiting extrasolar planets suggests a possible strategy for resolving the tangle of uncertainties .",
    "the extreme range of temperature conditions under which hot jupiters exist , along with the variety of masses that are probed , can potentially provide definitive constraints on the interior structure of these objects .",

    "comparison to observations .",
    "_ following the discovery of 51  pegb ( _ mayor and queloz _ , 1995 ) , models of jovian - mass planets subject to strong irradiation were computed ( _ lin , bodenheimer and richardson _ , 1996 ; _ guillot et al .",
    "_ , 1996 ) .",
    "these models predicted that short - period jovian - mass planets with effective temperatures of roughly @xmath45  k would be significantly larger than jupiter , and the discovery that hd  209458b has a large radius initially seemed to confirm these calculations .",
    "in general , @xmath4 is a weak function of planet mass , reflecting the overall @xmath46 polytropic character of giant planets ( _ burrows et al .",
    "_ , 1997 , 2001 ) .",
    "in order to evaluate the present situation , we have collected the relevant quantities for the 9 transiting planets in table  1 .",
    "in particular , we list the most up - to - date estimates of @xmath39 , @xmath5 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath1 , as well as the stellar effective temperature , @xmath47 .",
    "we also list the value of the planetary equilibrium temperature , @xmath48 , which is calculated by assuming the value for the bond albedo , @xmath49 , recently estimated for tres-1 ( @xmath50 ; _ charbonneau et al .",
    "_ , 2005 ;  3.2.3 ) .",
    "the precision of the estimates of the physical properties varies considerably from star to star . by drawing from the gaussian distributions corresponding to the uncertainties in table  1 and the quoted value for @xmath49",
    ", we can estimate the uncertainty for @xmath1 and @xmath48 for each planet .",
    "thereafter , for a particular choice of @xmath1 and @xmath48 , and fixing the planetary age at 4.5  gyr , we can compute theoretical radii .",
    "for this task , we use the results of _ bodenheimer et al .  _",
    "( 2003 ) , who computed models for insolated planets ranging in mass from @xmath51 . to evaluate the radii differences that arise from different heavy element fractions ,",
    "separate sequences were computed for models that contain and do not contain 20-@xmath52 solid cores , and both predictions are listed in table  1 .",
    "the models have been calibrated so that , for the evolution of jupiter up to the age of 4.5  gyr , a model with a core gives the correct jupiter radius to within 1% .",
    "planetary age can also have a significant effect on @xmath4 .",
    "for example , the evolutionary models of _ burrows et al .  _",
    "( 2004 ) for ogle - tr-56b ( @xmath53 ) yield transit radii of @xmath54 at 100  myr , and @xmath55 after 2  gyr . in general",
    ", however , @xmath4 evolves only modestly beyond the first 500  myr , and hence the uncertainties in the ages of the parent stars ( for which such young ages may generally be excluded ) introduce errors of only a few percent into the values of @xmath4 .",
    "the models use a standard rosseland mean photospheric boundary condition , and as such , are primarily intended for cross - comparison of radii .",
    "the obtained planetary radii are , however , in excellent agreement with baseline models obtained by groups employing detailed frequency - dependent atmospheres ( e.g.  _ burrows et al . _ , 2004 ; _ chabrier et al .",
    "_ , 2004 ; _ fortney et al .",
    "_ , 2005b ) .",
    "the models assume that the surface temperature is uniform all the way around the planet , even though the rotation of the planet is likely tidally locked .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations of the atmosphere that aim , in part , to evaluate the efficiency with which the planet redistributes heat from the dayside to the nightside have been performed by _",
    "cho et al .  _",
    "( 2003 ) , _ showman and guillot _ ( 2002 ) , _ cooper and showman _ ( 2005 ) , and _ burkert et al .  _",
    "( 2005 ) under various simplifying assumptions .",
    "there is no agreement on what the temperature difference between the dayside and the nightside should be (  3.2.4 ) , and it depends on the assumed opacity in the atmosphere .",
    "_ burkert et al .  _",
    "( 2005 ) suggest that with a reasonable opacity , the difference could be @xmath56  k , not enough to make an appreciable difference in the radius .",
    "a number of interesting conclusions regarding the bulk structural properties of the transiting planets can be drawn from table  1 .",
    "first , the baseline radius predictions display ( @xmath57 ) agreement for seven of the nine known transiting planets .",
    "second , the planets whose radii are in good agreement with the models span the full range of masses and effective temperatures .",
    "the models do not appear to be systematically wrong in some particular portion of parameter space .",
    "although the reported accuracies of the basic physical parameters are noticeably worse for the ogle systems than for the brighter targets , the constraints are nonetheless useful to address models of their physical structure and , in particular , the presence or absence of a solid core . specifically , the baseline models in table  1 indicate that the presence of a solid core in a @xmath58 planet with @xmath59  k leads to a radius reduction of roughly @xmath60 .",
    "this difference generally exceeds the uncertainty in the estimate of @xmath4 .    in the standard core - accretion paradigm for giant planet formation , as reviewed by _",
    "lissauer _ ( 1993 ) , a jovian planet arises from the collisional agglomeration of a solid 10-@xmath52 core over a period of several million years , followed by a rapid accretion of hundreds of earth masses of nebular gas , lasting roughly @xmath61  yr . the competing gravitational instability hypothesis ( e.g.  _ boss _ 1997 , 2004 ) posits that gas - giant planets condense directly from spiral instabilities in protostellar disks on a dynamical timescale of less than @xmath62  yr . _",
    "boss _ ( 1998 ) points out that solid particles in the newly formed planet can precipitate to form a core during the initial contraction phase .",
    "only 1% of the matter in the planet is condensible , however , so a jovian - mass planet that formed by this process will have a core that is much less massive than one that formed by the core - accretion scenario .    among the 7 planets that show agreement with the baseline models , it is presently difficult to discern the presence of a core . however , the  transit radius \" effect ( _ burrows et al . _ , 2003 ;  2.2.3 ) will tend to systematically increase the observed radii above the model radii listed in table  1 ( which correspond to a 1-bar pressure level ) .",
    "similarly , signal - to - noise - limited field transit surveys bias the mean radius of planets so detected to a value larger than that of the intrinsic population ( _ gaudi _ , 2005 ) . taking both effects into account lends favor to the models with cores",
    ". clearly more transiting planets and more precise determinations of their properties are necessary , as are more physically detailed models .",
    "we note that the identification of lower - mass transiting planets ( for which the effect of a solid core is prominent ) would be particularly helpful to progress in these questions .",
    "several groups ( e.g.  _ gould et al .",
    "_ , 2003 ; _ hartman et al .",
    "_ , 2005 ; _ pepper and gaudi _ , 2006 ) have considered the prospects for ground - based searches for planets with radii of that of neptune , or less .",
    "+        _ 2.2.3 .  the transit radius effect .",
    "_ when a planet occults its parent star , the wavelength - dependent value of @xmath4 so inferred is not necessarily the canonical planetary radius at a pressure level of 1  bar ( _ lindal et al . _ , 1981 ; _ hubbard et al .",
    "_ , 2001 ) , which we have used for the baseline predictions in table  1 .",
    "as such , the measured radius is approximately the impact parameter of the transiting planet at which the optical depth to the stellar light along a chord parallel to the star - planet line of centers is unity .",
    "this is not the optical depth in the radial direction , nor is it associated with the radius at the radiative - convective boundary .",
    "hence , since the pressure level to which the transit beam is probing near the planet s terminator is close to one _ milli_bar ( _ fortney et al . _ , 2003 ) , there are typically @xmath63 pressure scale heights difference between the measured value of @xmath4 and either the radiative - convective boundary ( @xmath641000 bars ) and the 1-bar radius .",

    "( 2002 ) , the transit radius is at pressures well below the 1  millibar level , then the effect would be even larger . ) furthermore , exterior to the radiative - convective boundary , the entropy is an increasing function of radius .",
    "one consequence of this fact is significant radial inflation vis  vis a constant entropy atmosphere .",
    "both of these effects result in an apparent increase of perhaps @xmath65 ( @xmath667% ) in the theoretical radius for hd  209458b and @xmath67 ( @xmath664% ) for ogle - tr-56b .",

    "cooper and showman _ ( 2005 ) have recently demonstrated that strong atmospheric circulation currents that advect heat from the day to the night sides at a wide range of pressure levels are expected for close - in giant planets .",
    "_ showman and guillot _ ( 2002 ) estimate that below pressures of 1  bar the night - side cooling of the air can be quicker than the time it takes the winds to traverse the night side , but that at higher pressures the cooling timescale is far longer .",
    "importantly , the radiative - convective boundary in a planet such as hd  209458b is very deep , at pressures of perhaps 1000  bar .",
    "this may mean that due to the coupling of the day and the night sides via strong winds at depth , the temperature - pressure profiles at the convective boundary on both sides are similar .",
    "this would imply that the core cooling rate is roughly the same in both hemispheres .",
    "since the planet brightness inferred during secondary eclipse (  3.2.3 ) depends upon the advection of stellar heat to the night side , such data can provide onstraints on the meteorology and general circulation models .",
    "almost complete redistribution of heat occurs in the case of jupiter , where the interior flux is latitude- and longitude - independent .",
    "however , the similarity in jupiter of the day and night temperature - pressure profiles and effective temperatures is a consequence not of the redistribution of heat by rotation or zonal winds , but of the penetration into the convective zone on the day side of the stellar irradiation ( _ hubbard _ , 1977 ) .",
    "core convection then redistributes the heat globally and accounts for the uniformity of the temperature over the entire surface .",
    "therefore , whether direct heating of the convective zone by the stellar light is responsible , as it is in our own jovian planets , for the day - night smoothing can depend on the ability of the stellar insolation to penetrate below the radiative - convective boundary .",

    "clouds high in the atmospheres of hot jupiters with @xmath86  k would result in wavelength - dependent flux variations .",

    "wavelength - dependent sources of opacity in the upper portions of the planetary atmosphere , or in its exosphere , will impose absorption features that could be revealed in this ratio .",

    "the team measured an increase in the transit depth of @xmath87 for hd  209458 in a narrow bandpass centered on the sodium resonance lines near 589  nm .",
    "ruling out alternate explanations of this diminution , they conclude that the effect results from absorption due to atomic sodium in the planetary atmosphere , which indeed had been unanimously predicted to be a very prominent feature at visible wavelengths ( _ seager and sasselov _ , 2000 ; _ hubbard et al . _ , 2001 ; _ brown _ , 2001 ) .",
