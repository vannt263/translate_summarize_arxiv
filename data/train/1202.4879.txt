    "terrestrial gamma ray flashes ( tgfs ) were first observed above thunderclouds by the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) ( fishman et al . , 1994 ) .",
    "it was soon understood that these energetic photons were generated by the bremsstrahlung process when energetic electrons collide with air molecules @xcite ; these electrons were accelerated by some mechanism within the thunderstorm . since then , measurements of tgf s were extended and largely refined by the reuven ramaty energy solar spectroscopic imager ( rhessi ) ( cummer et al . , 2005 ; smith et al . , 2005 ,",

    "hard radiation was also measured from approaching lightning leaders ( moore et al . , 2001 ;",
    "dwyer et al . , 2005 ) ; and there are also a number of laboratory experiments where very energetic photons were generated during the streamer - leader stage of discharges in open air ( stankevich and kalinin , 1967 ; dwyer et al . , 2005b ; kostyrya et al . , 2006 ;",

    "next to gamma - ray flashes , flashes of energetic electrons have been detected above thunderstorms  @xcite ; they are distinguished from gamma - ray flashes by their dispersion and their location relative to the cloud - as charged particles in sufficiently thin air follow the geomagnetic field lines . in december 2009",
    "nasa s fermi satellite detected a substantial amount of positrons within these electron beams @xcite .",
    "it is now generally assumed that these positrons come from electron positron pairs that are generated when gamma - rays collide with air molecules .",
    "two different mechanisms for creating large amounts of energetic electrons in thunderclouds are presently discussed in the literature .",
    "the older suggestion is a relativistic run - away process in a rather homogeneous electric field inside the cloud ( wilson , 1925 ; gurevich , 1961 ; gurevich et al . , 1992 ; gurevich , 2001 dwyer , 2003 , 2007 ; milikh and roussel - dupr , 2010 ) .",
    "more recently research focusses on electron acceleration in the streamer - leader process with its strong local field enhancement ( moss et al . , 2006 ; li et al . , 2007 ; chanrion and neubert , 2008 ; li et al . , 2009 ; carlson et al",
    ". , 2010 ; celestin and pasko , 2011 ; li et al . , 2012 )",
    ".      whatever the mechanism of electron acceleration in thunderstorms is , ultimately one needs to calculate the energy spectrum and angular distribution of the emitted bremsstrahlung photons . as the electrons at the source form a rather directed beam pointing against the direction of the local field , the electron energy distribution together with the angles and energies of the emitted photons determine the photon energy spectrum measured by some remote detector .",
    "the energy resolved photon scattering angles are determined by so - called doubly differential cross - sections that resolve simultaneously energy @xmath0 and scattering angle @xmath1 of the photons for given energy @xmath2 of the incident electrons .",
    "the data is required for scattering on the light elements nitrogen and oxygen with atomic numbers @xmath3 and @xmath4 , while much research in the past has focussed on metals with large atomic numbers @xmath5 .",
    "the energy range up to 1 gev is relevant for tgf s ; we here will provide data valid for energies above 1 kev .    as illustrated by fig .  1 ,",
    "the full scattering problem is characterized by three angles .",
    "the two additional angles @xmath6 and @xmath7 determine the direction of the scattered electron relative to the incident electron and the emitted photon .",
    "the full angular and energy dependence of this process is determined by so - called triply differential cross - sections .",
    "a main result of the present paper is the analytical integration over the angles @xmath6 and @xmath7 to determine the doubly differential cross - sections relevant for tgf s .    as the cross - sections for the production of electron positron pairs from photons in the field of some nucleus are related by some physical symmetry to the bremsstrahlung process , we study these processes as well ; we provide doubly differential cross - sections for scattering angle @xmath8 and energy @xmath9 of the emitted positrons for given incident photon energy @xmath0 and atomic number @xmath5 .",

    "our present understanding of bremsstrahlung and pair production was largely developed in the first half of the 20th century .",

    "important older reviews are by heitler ( 1944 ) , by hough ( 1948 ) , and by koch and motz ( 1959 ) .",
    "we also used some recent text books ( greiner and reinhardt , 1995 ; peskin and schroeder , 1995 ) ; together with heitler ( 1944 ) and hough ( 1948 ) , they provide a good introduction into the quantum field theoretical description of bremsstrahlung and pair production .",
    "the calculation of these two processes is related through some physical symmetry as will be explained in chapter [ pair ] .    as drawn in fig .  1 ,",
    "when an electron scatters at a nucleus , a photon with frequency @xmath16 can be emitted .",
    "the geometry of this process is described by the three angles @xmath1 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "cross sections can be total or differential .",
    "total cross sections determine whether a collision takes place for given incident electron energy , singly differential cross sections give additional information on the photon energy or on the angle between incident electron and emitted photon , and doubly differential cross sections contain both .",
    "triply differential cross sections additionally contain the angle at which the electron is scattered . as two angles are required to characterize the direction of the scattered electron",
    ", one could argue that this cross section should actually be called quadruply differential , but the standard terminology for the process is triply differential .",
    "koch and motz ( 1959 ) review many different expressions for different limiting cases , but without derivations .",

    "several years later new ansatzes were made to describe bremsstrahlung .",
    "elwert and haug ( 1969 ) use approximate sommerfeld - maue eigenfunctions to derive cross sections for bremsstrahlung under the assumption of a pure coulomb field .",
    "they derive a triply differential cross section and beyond that also numerically a doubly differential cross section .",
    "furthermore they compare with results obtained by using the born approximation .",
    "they show that there is a small discrepancy for high atomic numbers between the bethe - heitler theory and experimental data , and they provide a correcting factor to fit the bethe - heitler approximation better to experimental data for large @xmath5 .",

    "they investigate bremsstrahlung and pair production for @xmath17 and for @xmath18 and show that their results with more accurate wave functions do not fit with the bethe heitler cross section exactly .",

    "for @xmath20 the theory of bethe and heitler , however , is stated to be in good agreement with experiments for energies above the kev range .",
    "they calculate triply differential cross sections using partial - wave and multipole expansions in a screened potential numerically for @xmath21 ( silver ) and @xmath18 and compare their results with experimental data .",
    "actually their results are close to the elwert haug theory which fits the experimental data better than their theory .",
    "shaffer and pratt ( 1997 ) also discuss the theory of elwert and haug ( 1969 ) and compare it with the bethe heitler theory and , additionally , with the bethe heitler results multiplied with the elwert factor and with the exact partial wave method .",
    "they show that all theories agree within a factor 10 in the kev energy range , and that the elwert - haug theory fits the exact partial wave method best . however , they only investigate bremsstrahlung for atomic nuclei with @xmath21 , 53 ( iodine ) , 60 ( neodymium ) , 68 ( erbium ) and 79 , but not for small atomic numbers @xmath3 and 8 as relevant in air . in summary ,",
    "elwert and haug ( 1969 ) , tseng and pratt ( 1971 ) , fink and pratt ( 1973 ) , shaffer et al . ( 1996 ) and shaffer and pratt ( 1997 ) calculate cross sections for bremsstrahlung and pair production for atomic numbers @xmath17 and @xmath22 numerically , but not analytically , and they do not provide any formula or data which can be used to simulate discharges in air .",
    "the eedl database consists mainly of experimental data which have been adjusted to nuclear model calculations .",
    "for the low energy range geant4 takes over this data and gives a fit formula .",
    "the singly differential cross section related to @xmath16 which is used in the geant4 toolkit is valid in an energy range from 1 kev to 10 gev and taken from seltzer and berger ( 1985 ) .",
    "the singly differential cross section related to @xmath1 is based on the doubly differential cross section by @xcite and valid for very high energies , i.e. , well above @xmath23 mev .",
    "but in the preimplemented cross sections of geant4 the dependence on the photon energy is neglected in this case so that it is actually a singly differential cross section describing @xmath1 .",

    "furthermore , the table shows the atomic number @xmath5 investigated and includes some further remarks .    for calculating the angularly resolved photon energy spectrum of tgf s ,",
    "we need a doubly differential cross section resolving both energy and emission angle of the photons ; we need it in the energy range between 1 kev and 1 gev for the small atomic numbers @xmath3 and 8 .",
    "therefore most of the literature reviewed here is not applicable .",
    "however , the bethe - heitler approximation is valid for atomic numbers @xmath20 and for electron energies above 1  kev  @xcite .",
    "how the range of validity depends on the atomic number @xmath5 is discussed in section [ valid ] .",
    "we therefore will use the triply differential cross section derived by bethe and heitler ( 1934 ) to determine the correct doubly differential cross .",

    "it also includes the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal ( lpm ) ( landau and pomeranchuk ,  1953 ) effect and dielectric suppression ( ter - mikaelian ,  1954 ) which do not contribute in the kev and mev range .",

    "lehtinen has suggested a doubly differential cross section in his phd thesis ( lehtlinen , 2000 ) that is also used by xu et al .",
    "lehtinen s ansatz is a heuristic approach based on factorization into two factors .",
    "the first factor is the singly differential cross section of bethe and heitler ( 1934 ) that resolves only electron and photon energies , but no angles .",
    "the second factor is due to jackson ( 1975 , p. 712",
    ", it depends on the variable @xmath24\\;/\\ ; ( 1-\\beta\\cos\\theta_i)^4 $ ] , where @xmath25 measures the incident electron velocity on the relativistic scale .",
    "however , this factor derived in jackson ( 1975 , p. 712",
    "is calculated in the classical and not quantum mechanical case , and it is valid only if the photon energy is much smaller than the total energy of the incident electron .",
    "we will compare this ansatz with our results in [ app_leht ] .",
    "dwyer ( 2007 ) chooses to use the triply differential cross section by bethe and heitler ( 1934 ) , but with an additional form factor parameterizing the structure of the nucleus  @xcite",
    ". we will show in [ app_form ] that this form factor , however , does not contribute for energies above 1  kev .",
    "this cross section depends on all three angles as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "if one is only interested in the angle @xmath1 between incident electron and emitted bremsstrahlung photon , the angles @xmath6 and @xmath7 have to be integrated out  either numerically , or the analytical results derived in the present paper can be used .      in chapter [ brems ]",
    "we introduce the triply differential cross section derived by bethe and heitler then we integrate over the two angles @xmath6 and @xmath7 to obtain the doubly differential cross section which gives a correlation between the energy of the emitted photon and its direction relative to the incident electron .",
    "furthermore , we investigate the limit of very small or very large angles and of high photon energies ; this also serves as a consistency check for the correct integration of the full expression .    in chapter [ pair ]",
    "we perform the same calculations for pair production , i.e. , when an incident photon interacts with an atomic nucleus and creates a positron electron pair . as we explain ,",
    "this process is actually related by some physical symmetry to bremsstrahlung , therefore results can be transferred from bremsstrahlung to pair production .",
    "we get a doubly differential cross section for energy and emission angle of the created positron relative to direction and energy of the incident photon .",
    "the physical interpretation and implications of our analytical results is discussed in chapter [ disc ] .",
    "energies and emission angles of the created photons and positrons are described in the particular case of scattering on nitrogen nuclei . for electron energies below 100  kev ,",
    "the emission of bremsstrahlung photons in different directions varies typically by not more than an order of magnitude , while for higher electron energies the photons are mainly emitted in forward direction . for this case",

    "if an electron with momentum @xmath26 approaches the nucleus of an atom , it can change its direction due to coulomb interaction with the nucleus ; the electron acceleration creates a bremsstrahlung photon with momentum @xmath27 that can be emitted at an angle @xmath1 relative to the initial direction of the electron .",

    "<S> we derive these doubly differential cross - sections by integrating analytically over the triply differential cross - sections derived by bethe and heitler ; this is appropriate for light atoms like nitrogen and oxygen ( z=7,8 ) if the energy of incident and emitted electron is larger than 1  kev . </S>",

    "<S> we also discuss some simplifying limit cases , and we derive some simple approximation for the most probable scattering angle .    </S>",
    "<S> we also provide cross sections for the production of electron positron pairs from energetic photons when they interact with air molecules . </S>",
    "<S> this process is related to the bremsstrahlung process by some physical symmetry . therefore the results above can be transferred to predictions on the angles between incident photon and emitted positron , again as a function of photon and positron energy . </S>",
    "<S> we present the distribution of angles and again a simple approximation for the most probable scattering angle .    </S>",
    "<S> our results are given as analytical expressions as well as in the form of a c++ code that can be directly be implemented into monte carlo codes .    </S>",
