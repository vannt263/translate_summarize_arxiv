    "so we have the two following corollaries .        in the previous papers @xcite and @xcite , the condition `` @xmath4 is nowhere vanishing jacobian '' ( see theorems [ valette4 ] and [ valettethuy2 ] ) implies @xmath4 is dominant . hence , the condition `` @xmath4 is dominant '' in the theorems [ thuy1 ] and [ thuy2 ] guarantees the condition of dimension of the set @xmath11 ( see theorem [ theoremjelonek1 ] ) .",
    "moreover , we need this condition in this paper also to be free ourself from the condition @xmath386 , since the condition of dimension of @xmath11 when @xmath4 is dominant also guarantees the ( generic ) tranversal position of the @xmath12-allowable chain which provides non triviality of homology and intersection homology of the variety @xmath0 when @xmath14 in theorems [ thuy1 ] and [ thuy2 ] ."
