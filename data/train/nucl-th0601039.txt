    "the nuclear size and mass are fundamental quantities characterizing the bulk properties of nuclei .",
    "in fact , the saturation of the binding energy and density deduced from systematic data for masses and charge radii of stable nuclei reflects the behavior of the equation of state of nearly symmetric nuclear matter near the saturation density @xmath1 .",
    "extension of such data to a more neutron - rich regime opens up an opportunity of probing the equation of state of asymmetric nuclear matter .",
    "one of the poorly known parameters characterizing such an equation of state is the density symmetry coefficient , @xmath2 , with the nucleon density @xmath3 and the density dependent symmetry energy @xmath4 .",
    "the sensitivity of @xmath0 to the structure and evolution of neutron stars and to nuclear structure and reactions has been discussed in ref .",
    "this parameter is expected to be deduced from future systematic data for unstable nuclei because macroscopic nuclear models yield a clear correlation between the root - mean - square ( rms ) matter radii of very neutron - rich nuclei and @xmath0 mainly through the @xmath0 dependence of the saturation density of asymmetric nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "for stable nuclei , electron and proton elastic scattering data have been obtained systematically , from which the charge and matter density distributions can be fairly well deduced @xcite , while for unstable nuclei , not only do electron elastic scattering experiments have yet to be performed , but also proton scattering data obtained from radioactive ion beams incident on a proton target @xcite are very limited . instead of relying on such elastic scattering data ,",
    "deduction of the rms matter radius of unstable nuclei has been often performed through measurements of reaction / interaction cross section ( e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . however , the relation between the reaction / interaction cross section and the matter radius is not obvious theoretically and in fact is quite model dependent .",
    "recently we systematically analyzed the proton elastic scattering and reaction cross section data for stable nuclei at proton incident energy of @xmath58001000 mev on the basis of a black sphere picture of nuclei @xcite .",
    "this picture is originally expected to give a decent description of the reaction cross section for any kind of incident particle that tends to be attenuated in the nuclear interiors .",
    "in fact we showed that for proton beams incident on stable nuclei , the cross section of the black sphere of radius @xmath6 , which was determined by fitting the angle of the first elastic diffraction peak calculated for the proton diffraction by a circular black disk of radius @xmath6 to the measured value , is consistent with the measured reaction cross section @xcite .",
    "we also showed that for stable nuclei of mass number @xmath7 , the quantity @xmath8 agrees with the rms matter radius deduced in previous elaborate analyses from the proton elastic scattering data within error bars @xcite .",
    "these salient features of the black sphere picture could help deduce the density dependence of the symmetry energy from future systematic data on the reaction cross section and proton elastic scattering for unstable nuclei .    in this work",
    "we construct a formula for the proton - nucleus total reaction cross section as a function of the target mass number @xmath9 , the proton incident energy @xmath10 , and the target neutron excess @xmath11 .",
    "the dependence of the cross section on @xmath9 and @xmath10 , which is deduced by combining the black sphere picture of nuclei with a simple argument involving the proton optical depth , is remarkably consistent with the empirical data for stable nuclei at @xmath121000 mev .",
    "bearing in mind future possible data for unstable nuclei at intermediate energies , we then describe the neutron excess dependence by using a radius formula @xcite constructed from macroscopic nuclear models in terms of @xmath0 . as a possible application of the formula",
    ", we discuss the effect of nuclear deformation and neutron halos on the reaction cross section .",
    "we finally extend the formula to the case of nucleus - nucleus reaction cross section and compare the result with the existing data .",
    "we start with a formula for the reaction cross section for protons on stable nuclei as a function of @xmath9 and @xmath10 . for this purpose",
    "we note the black sphere picture @xcite in which the black sphere radius @xmath6 is determined from @xmath13 with the proton incident momentum in the center - of - mass frame , @xmath14 , and the first peak angle for the measured diffraction in proton - nucleus elastic scattering , @xmath15 .",
    "we then recall the known properties from the black sphere picture for @xmath161000 mev @xcite : ( i ) the black sphere radius @xmath6 globally behaves as @xmath17 fm .",
    "( ii ) the measured @xmath18 agrees with @xmath19 within error bars .",
    "we also note that @xmath20 is satisfied for the values of @xmath10 down to about 100 mev @xcite and that @xmath18 is nearly flat at least for @xmath121000 mev @xcite .",
    "it is thus natural to set @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the black sphere radius at @xmath16 mev , and @xmath23 is the deviation of @xmath6 from @xmath22 at given @xmath10 above 100 mev . in this setting",
    ", we assume that the incident protons are point particles , leading to vanishing cross section for the proton - proton case .",
    "this is reasonable since the measured proton - proton reaction cross section is relatively small at @xmath24 mev @xcite .    in deriving the expression for @xmath23 , we focus on the `` optical '' depth for incident protons .",
    "note that in a real situation , the black sphere radius @xmath6 corresponds to a critical radius inside which the protons are attenuated in a target nucleus .",
    "more explicitly , the optical depth for the protons , @xmath25,\\ ] ] amounts to a critical value when the nearest distance between the proton trajectory and the nuclear target is @xmath6 . here",
    "@xmath26 is the proton trajectory , @xmath27 is the point @xmath28-nucleon density , and @xmath29 is the empirical @xmath30 total cross section ( e.g. , refs .",
    "let us now approximate the trajectory , although it is slightly distorted by the coulomb repulsion , by a straight line .",
    "we also approximate the nucleon distributions by a trapezoidal form of the length of the bottom , @xmath31 , and that of the top , @xmath32 , as shown in fig .  1",
    ", in such a way that they follow a typical behavior of the distributions deduced from elastic scattering data off stable nuclei @xcite , i.e. , @xmath33 @xmath34 and @xmath35 fm .",
    "this @xmath36 corresponds to the thickness parameter of about 0.53 fm in the two - parameter fermi distribution .",
    "we then replace the optical depth by an effective one , @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 is the total nucleon density at @xmath40 , and @xmath41 is the length of the part of the critical trajectory in which the total nucleon density is larger than @xmath39 .",
    "the value of @xmath42 is set to be 0.9 since this is consistent with the values of @xmath22 and @xmath39 for @xmath43c , @xmath44ni , @xmath45sn , and @xmath46pb that were deduced from the elastic scattering data ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",

    "as long as @xmath51 mev , @xmath52 is sufficiently small that @xmath53 because of the assumed trapezoidal distribution , one can obtain @xmath54 combining eqs .",

    "one thus obtains @xmath62 from this expression , @xmath61 can be shown to be small even for light elements .",
    "hereafter we substitute expression ( [ r ] ) into the reaction cross section formula ( [ final ] ) through @xmath49 .",
    "note that since both @xmath22 and @xmath63 behave as @xmath64 , the derivative @xmath65 may well be performed by assuming @xmath66 .    in fig .",
    "2 we compare the formula ( [ final ] ) with the empirical data for the reaction cross section for targets such as c , ca , zr , and pb . the formula ( [ final ] ) in which @xmath22 is set to be a value determined from the measured angle of the first diffraction maximum in proton elastic scattering @xcite well reproduces the @xmath10 dependence of the measured reaction cross section @xcite for @xmath10 down to about 100 mev .",
    "remarkably , it agrees almost completely with the 100180 mev data updated by auce _",

    "the @xmath10 dependence of such data is stronger for smaller @xmath9 , a feature described by the prefactor of @xmath67 in eq .",
    "( [ final ] ) .",
    "below 100 mev , the measured cross section shows resonance features and sharp decrease due to the coulomb repulsion between the incident proton and target nucleus , both of which are not allowed for in constructing the present formula .",
    "the neglect of the coulomb corrections is reasonable above 100 mev , since the empirical reaction cross section for protons on stable nuclei is appreciably lower than that for neutrons only at incident energy lower than @xmath68 mev @xcite .",
    "below 100 mev , there is another limitation that faces the formula ( [ final ] ) : @xmath69 is too large to make the formula applicable @xcite .",
    "we remark that the data above 200 mev , tabulated in ref .",
    "@xcite , have to be seen with caution .",
    "this is partly because the recent data at energies between 80 and 180 mev @xcite are not smoothly connected with the data above 200 mev and partly because the data between 200 mev and 600 mev are systematically larger than the data at 860 mev , in contrast to the tendency of the nucleon - nucleon total cross section @xcite .",
    "we also remark that the previous predictions based on microscopic optical potential models @xcite are more sensitive to @xmath10 than ours in a way more difficult to reproduce the @xmath10 dependence of the data .",

    "however , they differ significantly in the way of describing the energy dependence .",
    "kox @xmath70 @xmath71 introduced a semiempirical energy dependent parameter that takes care of changing `` surface transparency '' as the projectile energy changes , while the energy dependence of our formula stems solely from that of @xmath75 and hence our formula is free from any adjustable energy dependent parameter .",
    "we remark that the formula by kox @xmath70 @xmath71 is applicable for a wider range of the incident energy including the low energy region where the coulomb repulsion between the projectile and target takes effect , although it ignores resonance features which are also important in such a low energy region .",
    "we also remark that there is such a kind of formula as includes two adjustable energy dependent parameters @xcite .",
    "we now extend the cross section formula ( [ final ] ) constructed for stable nuclei to unstable nuclei by introducing the dependence on the neutron excess @xmath76 . in doing so",
    ", we first note a formula for the rms radii of proton and neutron point distributions , @xmath77 and @xmath78 , which reads @xmath79 with @xmath80 fm , @xmath81 fm , @xmath82 fm , and @xmath83 , and @xmath84 with @xmath85 fm , @xmath86 mev@xmath87 , @xmath88 mev@xmath89 , @xmath90 fm , and @xmath91 fm .",
    "this formula was constructed in ref .",
    "@xcite by fitting the calculations obtained from macroscopic nuclear models for @xmath7 , @xmath92 , and various values of the density symmetry coefficient @xmath0 and the incompressibility @xmath93 of symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "it was noted that the calculated results for the rms radii are almost independent of @xmath93 .",
    "we remark that the formulas ( [ rpfit ] ) and ( [ rnfit ] ) , when extrapolated into the range of @xmath94 , reproduces as well the values of the rms charge and matter radii deduced from elastic scattering data for stable nuclei .    the formulas ( [ rpfit ] ) and ( [ rnfit ] ) imply the significance of allowing for uncertainties in the density symmetry coefficient @xmath0 in describing the size dependent quantities at finite neutron excess .",
    "in fact , @xmath0 acts to increase the nuclear size at nonzero @xmath76 .",
    "this is mainly because the saturation density of uniform nuclear matter at finite neutron excess decreases from that in the symmetric case in such a way that the decrease is roughly proportional to @xmath95 @xcite .",
    "this effect of @xmath0 could be seen by systematically analyzing the first diffraction maxima in the proton elastic scattering data @xcite and thus could manifest itself more remarkably in the reaction cross section which behaves as the size squared .    in order to describe the cross section at finite neutron excess by including the effect of @xmath0",
    ", we multiply expression ( [ final ] ) by a scale factor @xmath96 with the rms matter radius @xmath97 .",
    "this is reasonable , because , at least for stable nuclei heavier than @xmath98 , the rms matter radii deduced in previous elaborate analyses from elastic scattering data agree very well with @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "although this agreement neither holds for @xmath99 @xcite nor is obvious at large neutron excess , it is natural to expect that the isospin dependence of @xmath100 is similar to that of @xmath6 .",
    "we remark in passing that the scale factor @xmath101 is sufficiently close to unity for stable nuclei including @xmath46pb that it does almost no damage to the good agreement between the formula and the data .",
    "in addition to the isospin dependence coming through this scale factor , another isospin dependence is inherent in the formula ( [ final ] ) through the part associated with @xmath102 . in the absence of detailed information about the surface diffuseness and neutron skin at large neutron excess ,",
    "we simply leave it as it is .",
    "this is expected to be good enough since @xmath103 and @xmath69 are not so different at @xmath121000 mev as to affect the analysis of the reaction cross section data within the error bars , which are typically of order a few percent .    in the black sphere picture adopted here ,",
    "possible neutron halos have no influence on the construction of the cross section formula for unstable nuclei .",
    "this is because such halos correspond to a very low density region which is `` optically '' very thin .",
    "moreover , the macroscopic nuclear models leading to eqs .",
    "( [ rpfit ] ) and ( [ rnfit ] ) do not allow for the possible presence of a neutron halo @xcite .",
    "if the cross section formula is significantly smaller than the empirical value for halo nuclei for reasonable values of @xmath0 , therefore , this would signify the limitation of the present framework and the enhancement of the reaction cross section due to the presence of halos .",
    "we now focus on the interaction cross section data for a halo nucleus @xmath104li @xcite as well as the reaction cross section data for helium isotopes @xcite .",
    "note that the interaction cross section can be regarded as equal to the reaction cross section for halo nuclei in which internucleon excitations generally involve breakup of halo neutrons .",
    "such light elements are expected to be suitable for examining the isospin dependence , partly because for stable nuclei @xmath22 is consistent with @xmath105 fm , and partly because @xmath101 can amount to about 1.1 .",
    "in fact , the formula ( [ final ] ) with @xmath106 fm well reproduces the data for @xmath107he @xcite and li of the natural abundance @xcite . from the formula ( [ final ] ) further multiplied by the scale factor @xmath101 with a typical @xmath0 value of 100 mev , we obtain a smaller value for @xmath104li by about 10 % , but a value consistent with the empirical data for halo nuclei @xmath108he and @xmath109he .",
    "it might be tempting to attribute this deviation for @xmath104li to the presence of a neutron halo , since the formula ( [ final ] ) and the scale factor @xmath101 are not influenced by an extremely low density tail of the neutron distribution .",
    "however , this attribution is not obvious because of the consistency obtained for @xmath108he and @xmath109he which are known to have a similar three - body structure to that of @xmath104li @xcite .",
    "so far we have assumed that nuclei are spherical .",
    "nuclear deformation , however , does affect the reaction cross section and thus might be deduced from the experimental data measured for heavy deformed nuclei . for simplicity , we focus on quadrupolar deformation and describe a nucleus as a static ellipsoid having the length , @xmath110 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , of the three axes . both for prolate ( @xmath112 ) and oblate ( @xmath113 ) deformations with random orientations , the cross section seen by incident protons becomes , on the average , larger than the value for a sphere of the same volume",
    ". the relative increment can be calculated as @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the quadrupolar deformation factor satisfying @xmath116 .",
    "this suggests that even for large deformation @xmath117 , @xmath118 amounts to about 2 % only .    in the above estimate of the effect of deformation , we ignore possible rotation of the nucleus . since the rotation speed is far smaller than the speed of light , it is reasonable to consider that the incident protons , which move relativistically , see the target nucleus nonrotating during the flight .",
    "however , rotation would tend to enlarge the nucleus itself .",
    "balance between the centrifugal force and the nuclear incompressibility would typically give rise to about a percent enhancement of the cross section .",
    "we can thus conclude that the combined effect of deformation and rotation is significantly smaller than the effect of large neutron excess .",

    "judging from the scattering pattern in the plot for @xmath138 mev , which is almost uniform within the band between @xmath147 % , and recalling that the formula is not influenced by the presence of neutron halos , we see no absolute need for taking into account the possible enhancement of the reaction cross section by an extremely low density tail of the neutron distribution in explaining the empirical values of the reaction cross section . in the absence of this enhancement",
    ", it is expected that one can deduce the value of @xmath0 from the comparison between the empirical data and the formula .",
    "we note , however , that the difference of the formula with @xmath138 mev from the formula with @xmath137 mev is of order or even smaller than that from the empirical data .",
    "this suggests the necessity of a systematic analysis in deducing the value of @xmath0 itself .",
    "we constructed a formula for the proton - nucleus reaction cross section in a way free from any adjustable @xmath10 dependent parameter .",
    "the dependence of the cross section on @xmath9 and @xmath10 was deduced by combining the black sphere picture of nuclei with a simple argument of the proton optical depth . for stable nuclei , this formula remarkably well reproduces the empirical @xmath10 dependence of the reaction cross section at @xmath121000 mev .",
    "this suggests a great advantage over previous microscopic optical potential models in which the @xmath10 dependence becomes too strong through the phase shift function to reproduce the empirical behavior .",
    "in addition , we took into account the effects of large neutron excess typical of unstable nuclei and nuclear deformation on the reaction cross section .",
    "we thus found out a possible way of examining the influence of the density dependence of the symmetry energy and the presence of neutron halos on the reaction cross section .",
    "we acknowledge the members of japan charged - particle nuclear reaction data group ( jcprg ) , especially n. ohtsuka , for kindly helping us collect various data sets .",
