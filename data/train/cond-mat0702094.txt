    "phase separation of the two - component bose gases was actually observed in the experiment  @xcite",

    "then the argument on the bose - fermi mixture with one - component fermions also applies to our case . using the results of the previous work  @xcite , which basically compares the ground state energies of the uniformly mixed states and the phase - separated states , eq .

    "therefore , with repulsive fb interactions , eq .",
    "( [ eq : stability ] ) exactly corresponds to the condition for phase separation to occur in the bec limit , whereas it corresponds to the condition only in the limiting case in the bcs limit .",
    "however , in the next section , we will show that the phase diagram is determined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : stability ] ) regardless of the density of bosons if the system is initially in a uniformly mixed state .",
    "we point out that salasnich and toigo also found the stability conditions based on the approximation of the ground state energy calculated by a monte carlo study @xcite .",
    "they explicitly calculated the stability conditions which agree with our findings in the bcs limit .",

    "in contrast , our theory is also valid in the bec region .    when the fb interactions are attractive , the condition eq .",
    "( [ eq : phase - separation ] ) is not satisfied since an increase of @xmath144 lowers the ground state energy of the uniformly mixed state",
    ". therefore , the phase - separated state is unstable . in this case",
    ", we expect the mixture to collapse by the fb attraction .",
    "in this section , we discuss how our stability condition can be verified in real systems .",

    "however , once the condition eq .",
    "( [ eq : stability ] ) is violated , the system becomes unstable against any small fluctuations .",
    "therefore , its phase diagram is expected to be like fig .",
    "[ fig : stability ] when the system is initially in a uniformly mixed state .",
    "this explains the contradiction between our results and that of the experiment of the @xmath0-@xmath1 mixture  @xcite . in this experiment",

    "( [ eq : stability ] ) only depends on the fermion density .",
    "this can be explained by considering that the initial state of the experiment where the collapse was observed was not a uniformly mixed state . in this case , the stability condition should be governed by @xmath145 where @xmath146 is the ground state energy of the state after the collapse .",

    "[ fig : stability ] ) , the transition to the other ground state can be observed by tuning @xmath25 to the bec region .",

    "<S> we investigate an ultracold bose - fermi mixture with a feshbach resonance between two hyperfine states of fermions . using a functional integral method , we calculate collective modes associated with fermion - pairs and bosons in a superfluid phase . </S>",
    "<S> we derive a stability condition of the mixtures , which is valid in the entire region of the bcs - bec crossover . </S>",
    "<S> this stability condition , which smoothly connects the well - known results obtained in both the bcs and bec limits , shows that sufficiently strong fb interactions destabilize the mixtures . in order to investigate the consequence of this instability </S>",
    "<S> , we study the ground state energy of both the uniformly mixed and the phase - separated states . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the fb repulsion induces a phase separation , whereas the fb attraction should cause a collapse of the mixture . </S>",
    "<S> the possibilities for the experimental observation of such instabilities are also discussed . </S>"
