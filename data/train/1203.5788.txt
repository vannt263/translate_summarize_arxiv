    "also poses an important test of the validity of the standard model after the higgs - like resonance is established .    in this paper",
    "we have analyzed the potential of event shape observables to discriminate between different @xmath0  hypotheses once a resonance is established .",
    "while more work from both theoretical and experimental sides is needed , we find excellent discrimination power for higgs masses in the vicinity of where and have reported an excess .",
    "sensitivity in @xmath0  studies is inherited from sensitivity in telling apart weak boson fusion and gluon fusion contributions , making event shape observables natural candidates to serve this purpose in a realistic experimental analysis . the ability to separate gf and wbf induced higgs production will allow for an improved measurement of the higgs couplings to fermions and electroweak gauge bosons .",
    "we find the discriminative power of the event shapes to be fairly robust when turning to the jet level , and we therefore conclude that discriminative power should persist even under busy pile - up conditions .",
    "the cuts we choose in sec .",
    "[ sec : selection ] to arrive at these results will be subject to modifications in the actual experimental analysis and only approximate the realistic situation , especially when semi - hadronic @xmath95 decays will be analyzed analogous to ref .",
    "it is , however , also clear that realistic selection criteria will affect the considered observables in a similar fashion .",
    "the higgs decay products do not explicitly enter our analysis apart from the reconstruction .",
    "hence modifications of @xmath66 will shift our findings of figs .",
    "[ fig : cls ] and [ fig : clsll ] to higher absolute luminosities but will not change the relative improvement of the observables of sec .",
    "[ sec : shapes ] over @xmath21 ( bear in mind our discussion of pile - up in sec .",
    "[ sec : pile ] ) .",
    "we have limited our analysis to @xmath17 tev .",
    "confronting data with the question for @xmath0  with a statistically reasonable outcome is driven by shape analyses which typically involve @xmath96 .",
    "it is therefore unlikely that such an analysis will be performed with the @xmath97 or @xmath98 run unless the resonance is significantly overproduced relative to the sm expectation .",
    "nonetheless , event shape strategies can also be applied for @xmath97 or @xmath98 center - of - mass energies .",
    "we have not exhausted the list of potentially sensitive event shape observables in our analysis . from a statistical point of view , the cross sections are large enough to eventually allow a two - dimensional analysis of observables orthogonal to the event shapes or a combination with other observables in a neural - net - based analysis .",
    "this should eventually allow to establish the @xmath0  of a 125 gev resonance shortly after its discovery .",
