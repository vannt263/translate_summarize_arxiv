    "the dynamics of interacting planar electrons in the lowest landau level ( lll ) of a strong magnetic field shows some interesting and not yet fully understood features at filling factors @xmath2 experimentally observed as the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe).@xcite    following haldane s proposal@xcite we will study the physics of the fqhe in a spherical geometry .",
    "this gives a clear meaning to the concept of filling factor since the one particle lll hilbert space is finite dimensional . for a sphere@xcite penetrated by @xmath3 flux quanta",
    "this dimension is @xmath4 and the filling factor is given by @xmath5 for @xmath6 electrons .",
    "trial wave functions play an important rle in our attempts to understand the fqhe .",
    "the prime example is the laughlin wave function@xcite which describes very accurately the ground state at filling factors @xmath7 with odd integer @xmath8 .",
    "there are two main attempts to understand other filling factors , the hierarchy model by haldane@xcite and halperin@xcite and the composite fermion ( cf ) model by jain.@xcite both describe the reaction of laughlin s ground state to the addition or removal of flux quanta by the creation of quasiholes or quasiparticles and give analytic expressions for the quasiparticle wavefunctions .",
    "after some remarks concerning the structure of these wavefunctions on the sphere this paper gives a comparison of them with the results of exact numerical diagonalizations including up to 10 electrons . besides energy expectation values and overlaps we discuss the distribution of pair angular momenta as a more demanding test .",
    "jain s proposal gives better results but contrary to the laughlin wavefunction it is not exact even for a electron interaction including only one quasipotential .",
    "using the wu - yang@xcite gauge for the field of a magnetic monopole in the center of the sphere ( radius @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 )    @xmath12    a basis for the @xmath4 dimensional one particle lll hilbert space is given by    @xmath13    here @xmath14 is the complex stereographic coordinate .",
    "these wave functions are orthonormal    @xmath15    and related to haldane s basis by a phase ( gauge ) factor @xmath16 .    in this gauge , the laughlin function has up to a normalization factor @xmath17 the usual shape @xmath18 . in the following",
    "we will always work with unnormalized wave functions .",
    "the conserved angular momentum @xmath19 acts in this basis by    @xmath20    the total angular momentum of all electrons @xmath21 commutes with the two particle interaction giving a decomposition of the spectrum into degenerate @xmath22 multiplets .",
    "so is the laughlin wave function a @xmath23 state with an homogeneous charge distribution and the quasiparticle appears as a @xmath24 multiplet .",
    "the first proposal for such a quasiparticle multiplet on the sphere is due to haldane in the framework of the hierarchy model and reads in our coordinates@xcite    @xmath25    one easily checks using eq .",
    "[ angular ] that the @xmath26 constitute a @xmath22 multiplet of spin @xmath27 .    in the cf model , on the other side , a quasiparticle at @xmath28 is described as a state of @xmath6 composite fermions in a reduced magnetic flux @xmath29 .",
    "since there is only room for @xmath30 particles in this lll , one composite particle has to be in the second landau level    @xmath31    now one has to make an electron wavefunction out of this composite fermion wave function according to    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the projector to the lll .",

    "a laplace transform projects out the @xmath6 particle contribution    @xmath55    as an illustration , the right hand side evaluates for @xmath56 electrons at @xmath57 to    @xmath58    and we can read off from the middle term @xmath59 that @xmath60 has dimension 18 .",

    "higher quasipotentials introduce more inhomogeneities outside the excitation as the case of coulomb interaction ( dashed line ) shows .",
    "as emphasized by gros and macdonald,@xcite a crucial rle in the dynamics of the fqhe is played by the distribution of pair angular momenta .",
    "the laughlin state is the only state in the @xmath28 hilbert space with vanishing contribution for the highest possible pair angular momentum @xmath79 for higher filling factors ( i.  e. in the presence of quasiparticles ) no such state exists in the hilbert space .",
    "but due to the @xmath69 interaction , the one quasiparticle ground state is still a state with very small probability of finding an electron pair with angular momentum @xmath79 these probabilities are shown for a @xmath71 electron system in fig .",
    "[ figang ] normalized to sum up to the number of pairs @xmath80 one sees clearly , how the interaction nearly empties the pair states coupling to @xmath69 resulting in a very high probability for pairs in the next - to - highest angular momentum state .",
    "this picture is not very much changed in the coulomb case , an astonishing result facing the fact that the @xmath81 interaction should suppress the amplitude of the next - to - highest angular momentum state .",
    "the smallness of this suppression confirms the point of view that the @xmath69 hard core model includes the essential physics of the fqhe and higher quasipotentials just make small qualitative changes .",
    "it seems that even in the hard core model the amplitudes for higher angular momentum pairs have already nearly reached their maximum for this hilbert space .",
    "it would be nice to have a theoretical insight in the occurrence of these filling factor dependent maximal and minimal probabilities of finding electron pairs in states of some relative angular momentum .",
    "remarkably , both the hierarchy and the cf proposal reproduce very well the exact distributions .",
    "this supports the conclusion that both of them capture in their analytic expressions some of the essential physics of the fqhe .",
    "the ground state energies show , however , a much better behaviour for the cf wavefunction especially in the large @xmath6 extrapolation .",
