    "dynamical behaviors of multicellular assemblies play a crucial role during tissue development @xcite and in the maintenance of adult tissues @xcite .",
    "in addition , disregulation of multicellular structures may lead to pathological situations such as tumor formation and tumor progression @xcite . in this context , cell monolayers",
    "have been extensively studied to model _ in vivo _ tissue functions .",
    "such approaches allow for well - controlled experiments , which have been performed in a variety of settings , such as monolayer spreading @xcite , wound healing @xcite , channel flow @xcite , confined flow @xcite , collective migration @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of multicellular assemblies is regulated through mechanical forces that act upon cell adhesive structures .",
    "these forces are exerted at the cell - substrate interface @xcite , but also through cell - cell junctions @xcite .",
    "the transmission of stresses within multicellular assemblies is thus important to understand collective movements , cell rearrangements and tissue homeostasis . even though kinematic information is readily available , mechanical properties that rely on internal stress are less well understood . indeed a number of important biological questions , such as the determination of the molecular mechanisms that underlie the transmission of force within a tissue @xcite , necessitate a measurement of internal stresses .",
    "several internal force measurement methods have been proposed and implemented ( see @xcite for a recent review ) : at the molecular scale , frster resonance energy transfer @xcite ; at the cell scale , microrheology @xcite ; at the tissue scale , liquid drops @xcite , birefringence @xcite , or laser ablation @xcite . although one would ideally like to read out from data the spatio - temporal dependence of the full stress field , the above methods yield either a local , sub - tissue scale measurement @xcite ; or a subset of the components of the stress tensor @xcite , or a relative measurement , up to an undetermined multiplicative constant @xcite .",
    "monolayer stress microscopy ( msm ) , first introduced in @xcite , does not suffer from these drawbacks : it builds upon the measurement of traction force data to estimate the stress field of monolayers of cohesive cells . indeed , the force exerted by cells on a planar deformable substrate can be computed from the displacement field of the underlying layer @xcite , using either : _ ( i ) _ traction force microscopy @xcite where small beads are inserted within the ( elastic ) substrate , their displacements are measured , and the traction forces are obtained by solving an inverse elastic problem ; or _",
    "( ii ) _ arrays of micropillars @xcite , where the traction forces are simply proportional to the in - plane displacements of the pillars .",
    "however , once the traction forces are known , obtaining the internal stress from the force balance equations is an underdetermined problem since , in the two dimensional case , three components of the symmetrical stress tensor must be obtained from two traction force components . in msm @xcite , these equations become well - posed thanks to an additional hypothesis on tissue rheology : the cell monolayer is assumed to be a linear , isotropic elastic body .",
    "msm has been validated independently on numerical data using particle dynamics simulations : in @xcite , the reasonable accuracy of stress reconstruction from data that does not correspond to an elastic rheology has been attributed to the weakness of shear stresses in both simulated and living tissues . assuming again that the tissue is an elastic body , and in addition that the displacement field is continuous at the cell - substrate interface , internal stresses may also be computed directly from substrate displacement data , circumventing the need to compute traction forces @xcite .    in the presence of cell divisions and extrusions that constantly rearrange a tissue @xcite ,",
    "it is not clear that its rheology is that of a solid body . to our knowledge ,",
    "the elastic rheology hypothesis has not been directly validated , while alternative rheologies have been proposed in the literature @xcite and shown to model successfully specific aspects of the mechanical behaviour of cell monolayers .",
    "further , the rheology of multicellular assemblies may depend on the timescale @xcite , as well as on the type of cell considered @xcite .",
    "these caveats call for a method to accurately estimate the internal stress field of a cell monolayer irrespective of the underlying rheology .    a classical way to solve underdetermined inversion problems involves bayesian inference @xcite , a technique originating in statistics @xcite , and now widely used in physics @xcite and biophysics @xcite . of note , bayesian inversion has also been used to solve the inverse elastic problem of traction force microscopy @xcite .",
    "recently , some among us proposed a bayesian force inference method based on cell geometry , and applied it to segmented images of the drosophila pupal wing and notum @xcite .",
    "the tissue - scale stress arises from coarse - graining of cell - cell interactions . for tight epithelia where adherens junctions are a key player of force transmission between neighboring cells",
    ", it is reasonable to assume that the cell - scale contribution to stress is mostly related to local contact within the apical side of the epithelium , whereas basal contributions from , _",
    "e.g. _ lamellipodia , are negligible .",
    "accordingly , the dominant contributors to tissue - scale stress were identified as cell pressures and cell - cell junction tensions , and force balance equations were written at each cell vertex , resulting in an underdetermined system .",
    "this system was solved using bayesian inversion @xcite , where the inferred tensions and pressures were the most likely values ( the modes ) of a posterior distribution function . in the case of the fruitfly pupal wing , it turned out that tissue stress , obtained by coarse - graining , is oriented by external forces , and that its anisotropy promotes hexagonal cell packing @xcite .",
    "similar systems of equations may become well - posed thanks to additional hypotheses ( equal cell pressures @xcite ) , or when cell pressures are not required @xcite .",
    "however the stress is measured up to an arbitrary additive constant : its absolute value is out of reach since the input data are cell vertex positions and cell junction angles .",
    "below , we formulate bayesian inversion stress microscopy ( bism ) , a method to estimate the internal stress field of a cell monolayer from traction force microscopy measurements .",
    "importantly , bism yields an absolute measure of the stress and dispenses with hypotheses on monolayer rheology .",
    "we define bism and introduce statistical measures of its accuracy .",
    "the method is first validated using numerical simulations that provide traction force data . the inferred stress field , once computed ,",
    "is compared to the simulated stress data used as a reference .",
    "robustness is checked by implementing changes in the statistical model , as well as in the mechanical ingredients of the numerical simulations .",
    "bism is further validated using experimental data in a quasi - one - dimensional geometry that allows for a direct calculation of the stress field by spatial integration of the traction force field .",
    "finally , our results are compared with existing methods .",
    "within a continuum description , a flat , thin cell monolayer is characterized at position @xmath0 and time @xmath1 by a field of two - dimensional internal stresses @xmath2 and by a field of external surfacic forces @xmath3 that the monolayer exerts on the substrate .",
    "since inertia is negligible , the balance of linear momentum reads in vector form @xmath4 and in cartesian coordinates @xmath5 ( see _ supplementary text 1.2 _ for polar coordinates ) @xmath6 note that at this stage , due to the grid definition ( see below and fig .",
    "[ fig : force : balance]b ) , we do not enforce the symmetry of the stress tensor ( equality of the shear stress components due to angular momentum conservation @xcite ) . with a confined monolayer in mind @xcite",

    "the units of stresses and ( surfacic ) forces are pa.m and pa respectively . assuming that the monolayer height is uniform and constant @xmath9 , the 3d stress reads @xmath10 .",
    "when spatial or temporal variations of the height can not be neglected @xcite , bism can be implemented by replacing @xmath3 by @xmath11 and by inferring the 3d stress from @xmath12 , provided that the height remains small compared to the system size , as is generally the case for _ in vitro _ cell monolayers @xcite .",
