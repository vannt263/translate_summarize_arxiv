    "the field of single - electronics started when new effects due to the quantization of charge in ultrasmall tunnel junctions , both in the superconducting and the normal state , where predicted by averin and likharev @xcite .",
    "the theory of averin and likharev considers a tunnel junction which is biased by an externally fixed current @xmath0 and whose voltage @xmath1 is measured by a very high impedance voltmeter with metallic shunt conductance @xmath2 .",
    "a tunnel junction consists of two conducting electrodes separated by a thin layer of insulating material and is characterized by its capacitance @xmath3 and tunnel resistance @xmath4 . when a voltage is applied to the small capacitance tunnel junction , the charge will flow continuously through the conductor and it will accumulate on the surface of the electrode against the insulating layer of the junction ( the adjacent electrode will have equal but opposite surface charge ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the insulating layer is thin enough for electrons to tunnel through .",
    "the state of the junction is described by the surface charge @xmath5 ( which is a continuous variable ) and the electrons @xmath6 that have tunnel through the insulating layer ( which is a discrete variable ) .",
    "averin and likharev predicted that if the charge @xmath5 at the junction is greater than @xmath7 , an electron can tunnel through the junction in a particular direction , subtracting @xmath8 from @xmath5 .",
    "likewise , if @xmath5 is less than @xmath9 , an electron can tunnel through the junction in opposite direction , adding @xmath8 to @xmath5 .",
    "but if @xmath5 is less than @xmath7 and greater than @xmath9 , tunneling in any direction would increase the energy of the system , hence tunneling will not occur .",
    "this suppression of tunneling is known today as the coulomb blockade @xcite .",
    "the physical origin of the coulomb blockade of single - electron tunneling ( set ) is quite simple . in a current - biased junction",
    ", each tunneling event leads to a change of the electrostatic energy of the system given by @xmath10 . if the initial charge @xmath5 is within the range @xmath11 , the energy change @xmath12 is positive and at low temperatures tunneling events are impossible . on the other hand , if @xmath13 , tunneling is possible because this process reduces the electrostatic energy .",
    "an interesting prediction of averin and likharev was the set oscillations in the voltage across the junction @xcite . due to",
    "the coulomb blockade of tunneling the charge @xmath5 on the junction accumulates until its threshold value @xmath14 is reached and then the junction is recharged by the externally fixed current .",
    "this whole process repeats itself with a frequency @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "+ the purpose of this article is to show that there are set oscillations without an external applied current in a small tunnel junction . in this case , the set oscillations are driven by the lorentz force due to the rotation of a conductor with a small tunnel junction and an applied external magnetic field .",
    "in addition , this mechanically driven device is proposed as a transducer of motion into electricity .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first i will start by giving a thermodynamic formulation of the problem and the basic relations of the theory .",
    "then i will analyze the system using a density matrix approach to include many - body effects and show the set oscillations in the system .",
    "the conclusions are summarized in the last section .",
    "consider the faraday generator shown in fig .",

    "the rod completes the circuit , with one contact point on one end of the rod and the other on the circular rim . the circuit containing the galvanometer is completed by an open wire structure with a switch .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     for the case when the switch is open there will be no electromotive force , however we know from elementary electrodynamic courses that charge will pile up at the two ends of the rod and will produce an electric field that balances the lorentz force felt by the moving charges inside the conductor ( see fig . ( [ diagrams])(a ) ) .",
    "+ the free energy of the system is given by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the total energy of the rotating rod , @xmath20 is the magnetic dipole moment of the circulating charge at the end of the rod and @xmath21 is the constant magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of motion . taking the magnetic field as @xmath22",
    ", the free energy is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the internal energy of the rod , @xmath25 denotes the moment of inertia for the rod with respect to the axis of rotation and we have taken the current as @xmath26 .",
    "it should be remembered that rotation in general changes the distribution of mass in the body , and so the moment of inertia and internal energy of the body are in general functions of @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "+ when the switch is turned on there is an electromotive force @xmath27 in the circuit and hence charge will be circulating around the circuit .",
    "the free energy of the system in this case is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the amount of charge circulating around the circuit and @xmath30 is the work done by the system .",
    "the change in free energy is obtained by subtracting eq.([eq2 ] ) from eq.([eq1 ] ) , which gives us @xmath31 if the system is in thermodynamic equilibrium then @xmath32 and we obtain @xmath33 , as we know from elementary electrodynamic courses @xcite . note that @xmath34 .",
    "+ now i will consider the case when there is a tunnel junction at position @xmath35 with thickness @xmath36 in the conducting rod as shown in fig.([tunnel ] ) .     and a uniform magnetic field pointing into the page .",
    "note how the charge accumulates on the surface of the electrode against the insulating layer .",
    "for this case current will only flow when a tunnel event occurs.,width=264 ]    for this case , even if the switch is turned on there will be no current flowing through the circuit because the charge @xmath5 will accumulate on the surface of the electrode against the insulating layer as depicted in fig.([tunnel ] ) . nevertheless , quantum mechanically speaking there is a probability for the charge to tunnel through the junction .",
    "the free energy of the system before quantum tunneling is given by @xmath37 , where @xmath20 and @xmath38 corresponds to the magnetic dipole moment of the charge accumulated at the end of the rod and against both sides of the insulating layer , and @xmath39 , where @xmath3 is the capacitance of the tunnel junction .",

    "when a tunnel event takes place the charge @xmath47 will change by @xmath48 and after a time @xmath49 the rotational motion of the conducting rod immerse in the constant magnetic field will recharged the junction and another tunnel event will take place . as a result the tunneling events will occur periodically with frequency @xmath50 . + for the particular case",
