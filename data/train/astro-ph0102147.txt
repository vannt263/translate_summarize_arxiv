    "the high- and intermediate - velocity clouds ( hvcs and ivcs ) consist of gas moving at velocities incompatible with a simple model of differential galactic rotation ( wakker 1991 ) .",
    "an operational definition has been that hvcs have velocities larger than @xmath090  ( positive or negative ) relative to the lsr .",
    "the definition of ivcs has been less strict . in this paper",
    "they are defined as clouds with velocities relative to the lsr between @xmath040 and 90 . in a few directions slightly lower velocities",
    "are included , if there is a clear connection with gas at higher velocities .",
    "this definition excludes many clouds with @xmath2@xmath2@xmath340  that were considered an ivc by other authors , but in most cases these have ill - defined borders and often such velocities can be understood within the framework of differential galactic rotation , after allowing for turbulent velocities of up to 30 .",
    "the hvcs and ivcs are still poorly understood , although much progress has been made in the most recent decade .",
    "they appear to serve as tracers of energetic processes in the galactic disk and halo ( as part of a `` galactic fountain '' ) , but also as an ingredient in the continuing formation of the galaxy ( some are examples of accreting gas ) .",
    "finally , some may be tidal remnants ( most prominently the magellanic stream ) , or isolated clouds in the local group .",
    "a review of our understanding as of a few years ago was presented by wakker & van woerden ( 1997 ) ; an update has already proven necessary ( wakker et al .",
    "ever since the discovery of the hvcs ( muller et al .  1963 ) , it has been clear that the key to a proper understanding lies in using interstellar absorption lines to determine distances ( and metallicities ) for this class of clouds .",
    "thus , some of the recent progress has come from new models and improved mapping , but most has come from new observations of interstellar absorption lines .",
    "mapping  the published hvc all - sky maps ( hulsbosch & wakker 1988 , bajaja et al .",
    "1985 ) have proven very useful to understand the properties and statistics of the hvcs . however ,",
    "both these surveys suffer from low velocity resolution ( 16 ) and incomplete mapping .",

    "this paper presents new ivc maps based on the lds , and new maps for southern hvcs based on the iar list .",
    "the lds and both parkes surveys are further used to construct  spectra toward hvc and ivc probes .",
    "models  gardiner & noguchi ( 1996 ) presented a modern version of the model in which the magellanic stream is formed by tidal stripping . combined with the observational identification of the predicted leading arm by lu et al.(1998 ) and putman et al .  (",
    "1998 ) , this has led to a better understanding of the stream and of which other hvcs could be part of the same tidal feature .",
    "blitz et al .  ( 1999 ) suggested that the majority of the hvcs are remnants of the formation of the local group , and are similar to the original building blocks of the milky way and the andromeda nebula .",
    "braun & burton ( 1999 ) presented a variant of this interpretation , in which only some small hvcs are local group clouds .",
    "these models contrast with previous ones in which the hvcs / ivcs are generated in a galactic fountain ( bregman 1980 ) or are remnants of the formation of the milky way ( oort 1970 ) .",

    "most hvc / ivc metallicity and distance estimates are fairly recent , with half of the relevant papers published since 1994 .",
    "this is partly due to the availability of the `` goddard high resolution spectrograph '' ( _ ghrs _ ) , the `` space telescope imaging spectrograph '' ( _ stis _ ) , and the `` far ultra - violet spectroscopic explorer '' ( _ fuse _ ) , and partly to an increase in sensitivity of ground - based telescopes .",

    "the values in each column of the main table are described in detail in appendix  a.",
    "table  provides an index to the main table ( table  ) , to help find particular clouds or probes .",
    "the first part of this table lists the hvc and ivc names and the table page on which results for each cloud can be found . for a number of clouds an abbreviation",

    "in addition there are 21 unnamed clouds , which often are only seen in absorption .",
    "data are given for 326 different targets ( stars and agns ) , with 1078 entries , one for each observation of an ion .",
    "stars less distant than @xmath00.2kpc were excluded to avoid including many nearby stars that provide little distance information ( i.e.  neither upper nor lower limits ) .",
    "the classical hvcs ( a , m , c , h , anti - center  see wakker & van woerden 1991 ) are listed first , followed by the gcn and gcp complexes , the outer arm , the magellanic stream and the smaller hvc complexes . a new",

    "savage & sembach ( 1996a , sect .",
    "7 ) define @xmath7 in this way , but call it `` depletion '' , implying that the gaseous abundances appear lower than solar because most of the element s atoms sit in dust grains .",
    "however , with this definition @xmath7 really refers to the combination of depletion and ionization , as both depletion onto dust grains and the presence of different ionization stages can make the elemental abundance in the gas appear lower than the intrinsic abundance . here",
    ", we will use @xmath7 to stand for the observed relative abundance in the gas , i.e.  the product of depletion onto dust and ionization .",
    "below , some general remarks are given concerning reference abundances , oscillator strengths , complications due to ionization , and comparisons of different measurements of the same ion in the same cloud . a correlation between ion abundances and  column density",

    "early results on molecular hydrogen are listed .",
    "next , dominant ions of undepleted ions are discussed , which yield intrinsic abundances .",
    "this is followed by a discussion of dominant ions of depleted elements , which yield depletion patterns and insight into the presence ( and composition ) of the dust , then , results for non - dominant ions are summarized .",
    "finally , the highly - ionized ions are described .",
    "a more detailed discussion of the numerical results for each cloud is presented in sect .  .",
    "reference abundances are summarized in table  , following savage & sembach ( 1996a ) .",
    "this table lists the solar system ( meteoritic ) abundances of the element , as given by anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) ( with photospheric updates for c , n and o from grevesse & noels 1993 ) , the depletion @xmath8 ionization ( assuming a halo - like pattern , as given by savage & sembach 1996a ) , the resulting expected halo abundance ( in parts per billion , ppb ) , and the ionization potential of the previous and next ionization stage ( i.e.  the energy required to produce and destroy the ion ) .",
    "solar system abundances are used as a reference because these are comparatively well - determined . however , as savage & sembach ( 1996a ) point out , abundances in nearby b stars tend to be 0.150.25 dex lower . since",
    "b stars have formed recently , they may be a better reference for the local ism .",
    "ism abundances may also show inhomogeneities between individual open clusters .",
    "such differences mostly influence the interpretation of depletion patterns and the composition of dust .",
    "meyer et al .  ( 1998 ) determined from a set of high - quality measurements that the typical gaseous abundance of oxygen in nearby low - velocity gas is about 320000 ppb , or 0.4 solar .",
    "they also argued that dust contains at most 180000 ppb of oxygen , so that the total oxygen abundance in the nearby ism is about 0.66 solar .",
    "this is similar to the value derived for nearby b - stars .",
    "the suggested explanations are that a ) the early solar system was enriched by a supernova , b ) the ism has recently been diluted by metal - poor gas , or c ) the sun has moved outward from the galactic center since it formed .",
    "this abundance difference is mostly important when using a depletion pattern to derive the composition of dust particles .",
    "further , if the local ism indeed has intrinsic abundances below solar , this has some bearing on understanding the origin of relatively nearby intermediate - velocity halo gas , which appears to have solar abundance ( as derived from sulphur , see sects .  .",

    "table  shows the range of abundances found in the hvcs and ivcs for these elements ( in the column labeled @xmath6(halo ) ) .",
    "an average value is given for @xmath7 .",
    "these abundances clearly can vary by a large amount , which is not unexpected considering that they depend on the detailed physical conditions in a cloud ( temperature , density , radiation field ) .    rarely are there complementary data for other ionization stages for clouds where non - dominant ions were measured . and in cases where both kinds of ions have been measured , usually no analysis of physical conditions has been done  the exceptions being hd93521 ( spitzer & fitzpatrick 1993 ) , hd215733 ( fitzpatrick & spitzer 1997 ) , sn1987a ( welty et al .",
    "1999 ) and pg0804 + 761 ( richter et al .",
    "2001a ) .      to convert the observed amount of absorption into a column density , it is necessary to know the oscillator strength or @xmath9-value of the line . for papers published since 1990 , most authors take @xmath9-values from the list of morton ( 1991 ) .",
    "no attempt was made to correct column densities in older papers or papers where a different source was used for the @xmath9-values .",
    "in general , differences tend to be relatively small ( @xmath320% ) , although there are exceptions .",
    "still , this is an extra source of systematic uncertainty in the tabulated column densities .",
    "if a paper gave the column density , this was used in table  , independent of the actual @xmath9-value and method used to derive this column density .",
    "if a paper gave an equivalent width , this was converted to a column density as described in appendix  a under col .  .",
