    "the fermion dipole moments are some of the best measured quantities in physics .",
    "while the limits for the cp - violating ones , the electric dipole moments , are impressive@xcite ( @xmath2 e - cm for the electron and the neutron ) , the agreement between the measurement of the anomalous magnetic dipole moments of the electron and of the muon and its theoretical prediction is such that provides the best determination of the fine structure constant .",
    "since the first prediction for the electron anomalous magnetic moment computed by schwinger@xcite , the magnetic properties of the leptons played a central role in testing symmetries and the quantum prediction of the theory .",
    "this could be done thanks to the relativity long lifetime of the muon and the stability of the electron in ordinary atoms .",
    "for the heavy fermions the situation is very different . as short lived - particles , there is no possibility of such high precision experiments .",
    "nevertheless , the magnetic dipole moments are , for on - shell particles , physical magnitudes that not only contain important information about the interactions , but may also give some insights on the mechanism of mass generation . due to the high mass of the tau lepton ( and other heavy fermions )",
    "the measurement of the dipole moments is an interesting test for the standard model and possible new physics that may show up there . as expressed by m.perl@xcite in the section _ dreams and odd ideas in tau research _ : \" ... it would be very nice to measure @xmath3 with enough precision to check this [ the schwinger term @xmath4 , as it was checked for the @xmath5 and the @xmath6 years ago._at present such precision is a dream . \" _",
    "previous bounds on the tau magnetic moment @xmath7 are indirect @xcite , or include a partial analysis of the amplitudes in the considered processes@xcite . in the first case they come from the observation that in general extensions of the standard model ( sm ) it is very difficult to generate a weak magnetic moment , @xmath8 , for a lepton without originating a coupling of the z boson to the lepton of the same order of magnitude .",
    "this weak magnetic coupling is strongly bounded by lep1 , therefore , by assuming that the magnetic moment of the lepton ( @xmath7 ) has the same size , one obtains a rather strong bound on it . on the other hand , far from the resonance the @xmath7 magnetic moment couplings of the tau is more important and should be taken into account in the theoretical and experimental analysis . finally , the tau - w magnetic coupling was first considered in the w decays into tau plus leptons@xcite and also at low energies in the tau decays into leptons and pions@xcite .",
    "while these arguments are plausible , a complete analysis of the data coming from tau - lepton production at lep1 , sld and lep2 , and data on w decays into tau leptons from lep2 and @xmath9 colliders , allows for a better understanding of the magnetic moment couplings of the tau to the photon , the z and the w bosons .",
    "more technical details of what follows can be found in @xcite .",
    "the anomalous magnetic moments of the tau lepton , as the rest of the leptons , receive the standard contribution from the schwinger term .",
    "however , in the case of the tau lepton , larger contributions from new physics are still allowed . at the electroweak scale",
    "those can be studied within the effective lagrangian approach .",
    "magnetic dipole moments are usually defined with all particles in the magnetic moment vertex on - shell because _ these are the gauge invariant quantities of the theory , as shown in the classical paper _ @xcite .    for the @xmath7 tau magnetic dipole moment",
    "there is no available experiment satisfying the above requirement and to determine it one has to resort to general and consistent ( gauge invariant ) parameterizations of all physics in which the magnetic moment could play a significant role .",
    "the most general of those parameterizations is based on the effective field theory language which will allow us to relate off - shell matrix elements with the physical on - shell anomalous magnetic moment @xmath7 . instead , the @xmath8 can be determined on - shell : we have tau pair production at the z - peak at various experiments and specific observables proportional to the weak magnetic moment have been calculated@xcite and measured@xcite .",
    "the effective lagrangian approach @xcite we use is described in section 2 where we also fix the notation . magnetic moment are generated by non - renormalizable couplings , their effects grow with energy and , therefore , high energy experiments , though not as precise as experiments at lower energies , can still be relevant .",
    "this is the case for lep1 and sld measurements as compared to lep2 ones .",
    "besides , while the former are only sensitive to the z - magnetic couplings , lep2 is sensitive to both z and photon magnetic moments ( @xmath8 and @xmath7 ) .",
    "far from the resonance the statistics rapidly decreases and the precision is not as good . in general , lower energy experiments do not provide stringent bounds : the suppression factor @xmath10 has to be compensated by higher precision in the experiment ( see for instance the bounds obtained from tau decays @xcite ) .",
    "observables are studied in section 3 where tau production is considered in universality test and transverse polarization at lep1-sld , total production rates at lep2 , and lepton universality in @xmath11 decays in lep2 and hadron colliders .",
    "what are the observables related to the magnetic moments ? there is no symmetry guide as , for example , in cp - violation by electric dipole moments , where specific cp - odd observables can be constructed .",
    "however , magnetic couplings flip chirality , so in order to select the physical effects of the magnetic moments one should take these properties into account . in the standard model the only source of chirality flips are fermion masses , much lower than the electroweak scale .",
    "this means that any contribution to inclusive observables are either suppressed by the fermion masses or need two operator insertions and then , they come as the electroweak magnetic moments squared .",
    "furthermore , any new physics terms , not only that related to the magnetic moments will appear in these observables .",
    "it is therefore convenient to also include observables that are exactly zero when chirality is conserved : these will be only sensitive to fermion masses and/or magnetic moments and will depend linearly on the couplings .",
    "up to now , observables of this kind have been studied at lep1 but not at lep2 .",
    "there are only two gauge invariant dimension six operators contributing to magnetic moments in the effective lagrangian .",
    "therefore gauge invariance imposes a relationship among the three weak and electromagnetic magnetic moments.therefore one can achieve some insight on tau magnetic moments by studying w decays into tau leptons .",
    "there exist good bounds on universality of w decays into leptons coming from lep2 , ua1 , ua2 , cdf and d0 that can be translated into limits on the magnetic moments .    in section 4 we present the combined analysis of the observables , compare them to other bounds found in the literature and discuss the results .",
    "the new physics phenomenology at low energy , _",
    "i.e. _ at energies much lower than the scale of this new physics , can be parametrized by an effective lagrangian built with the standard model particle spectrum and gauge symmetry , having as zero order term just the standard model lagrangian , plus higher dimension gauge invariant operators suppressed by the scale of new physics @xmath12 .",
    "the leading non - standard effects will come from the operators with the lowest dimension .",
    "those are dimension six operators and among them there are only two operators that contribute to the tau magnetic moments : @xmath13 @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the tau leptonic doublet , @xmath16 is the higgs doublet , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the u(1)@xmath19 and su(2)@xmath20 field strength tensors .",
    "other dimension six operators like @xmath21 reduce to the operator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ob ] ) after the use of the standard model equations of motion .",
    "the effective lagrangian is @xmath22 where we will take the couplings @xmath23 and @xmath24 real .",
    "after spontaneous symmetry breaking , the higgs gets a vacuum expectation value and , as usual , the interactions in ( [ eq : interaccio ] ) can be written in terms of the gauge boson mass eigenstates @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "our lagrangian , written in terms of the mass eigenstates , is @xmath28 where one can recognize the usual couplings related to the magnetic moments .",
    "@xmath29 ( for @xmath30 ) is the abelian field strength tensor for the gauge bosons .",
    "we have not written the non - abelian couplings involving more than one gauge boson because they do not contribute to magnetic moments at leading order .",
    "the above new physics magnetic moments can be written as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the higgs vacuum expectation value and @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "the lagrangian ( [ eq : leff_fin ] ) gives additional contributions to the anomalous standard model electromagnetic moment of the tau @xmath35 .",
    "the same is true for the other magnetic moments that have been introduced for the weak magnetic moments : @xmath8 for the @xmath36-boson@xcite , and @xmath37 for the @xmath11-boson@xcite .",
    "sometimes it will be convenient to consider the following dimensionless couplings , proportional to the magnetic moments @xmath38 where @xmath39 .",
    "we would like to stress the following point . in the effective lagrangian approach ,",
    "_ exactly _ the same couplings that contribute to processes at high energies also contribute to the ( magnetic moment ) form factors , @xmath40 , at @xmath41 .",
    "the difference @xmath42 only comes from higher dimension operators whose effect is suppressed by powers of @xmath43 , as long as @xmath44 as needed for the consistence of the effective lagrangian approach .",
    "this means that any measurement ( bound ) for the new physics contributions to magnetic moments , at an energy scale where some of the gauge bosons or other particles are off - shell , can be directly added to the on - shell standard model prediction in order to get a value ( limit ) on the magnetic dipole moments .",
    "the effects of the operators in ( [ eq : leff_fin ] ) are suppressed at low energies .",
    "this means that the most interesting bounds will come from the highest precision experiments at the highest available energies . at present",
    "they are lep1 and sld ( @xmath36 decay rates and polarization asymmetries ) , lep2 ( cross sections and @xmath11 decays rates ) , cdf and d0 ( @xmath11 decay rates ) .",
    "consequently in the following section we will study all those observables .",
    "in this section we will present the observables best suited to set bounds on the magnetic moments .",
    "we begin with tau pair production in @xmath45 from threshold to lep2 energies .",
    "therefore we will include both photon and z - exchange with standard model vector and axial couplings to fermions , plus additional magnetic moment couplings given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : leff_fin ] ) .",
    "the expressions for the cross section can be found in @xcite .",
    "it can be separated into three types of contributions : i ) the standard model tree level contribution , which is the dominant one , ii ) a contribution which is proportional to the tau mass .",
    "this comes together with an insertion of the magnetic moment operators ( non - standard contribution ) or with an insertion of another fermion mass ( standard model contributions ) or both , two insertions of magnetic moment operators and two mass insertions ( non - standard contributions ) , and iii ) a contribution free of masses but with two insertions of the magnetic moment operators .",
    "this can be easily understood , since standard model couplings of gauge bosons to fermions conserve chirality , while mass terms and magnetic moment couplings change it , therefore interference of magnetic moment contributions with standard ones should be proportional to the fermion masses and only the square of magnetic moments can be independent of fermion masses . in the limit of zero tau mass only the contribution iii ) is relevant , however there could be some range of the parameters in which contribution ii ) is higher than iii ) .",
    "in fact for any finite value of the tau mass it is obvious that for large enough @xmath12 ii ) will always dominate over iii ) . in order to be as general as possible",
    "we will include all three contributions .",
    "bounds on the couplings @xmath7 and @xmath8 can be obtained from lep1-sld universality tests by assuming that only the tau lepton has anomalous magnetic moments ( muon and electron electromagnetic moments have been measured quite precisely  @xcite ) . in order to compare with experimental data",
    "it is convenient to define the universality ratio : @xmath46 here @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the quantities directly measured @xcite , @xmath49 is the standard model contribution ( including lepton - mass corrections ) , and @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the linear and quadratic terms , respectively , in the tensor couplings .",
    "notice that this quotient eliminates the hadronic part that , although very well determined in experiments , has much higher theoretical uncertainties than @xmath52 .",
    "the theoretical expression for @xmath52 can be computed from the cross sections , and it is @xmath53~ ,   \\label{eq : ratio1}\\ ] ] @xmath54 @xmath55 \\,\\frac{1}{v^2+a^2}\\ , \\ez^2\\label{eq : rat2}\\ ] ] with @xmath56 , @xmath57 .",
    "notice that in the ratio eq .",
    "( [ eq : ratiocross ] ) the electroweak radiative corrections cancel to a large extent and , therefore , we can use tree - level formulae .",
    "however , if needed , the expressions in can be improved by using effective couplings @xcite . from the very precise experimental lep1 and sld measurements",
    "@xcite we obtain @xmath58 comparing the equation ( [ eq : ratiocross1 ] ) with ( [ eq : ratiocross ] ) one gets @xmath59 that leads to the following two bands for @xmath60 : @xmath61 or @xmath62      at lep2 , the contributions coming from the photon - exchange are dominant over those coming from the @xmath36-exchange , and as a result both magnetic moments , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , will enter into the constraints .",
    "present experimental errors from @xmath63 cross section are much milder at lep2 than at lep1 . a combination of the lep2 data @xcite on this cross section , for @xmath64 ( the invariant mass of the pair of tau leptons ) so that @xmath65 , is listed in table [ tabla1 ] .",
    "this combination of data has been only made for the 183 gev and 189 gev data - sets as they have the highest luminosity and center - of - mass energies .",
    "for comparison we also present the standard model prediction for the cross section . in both , experimental results and standard model predictions , initial - final state radiation photon interference is subtracted .",
    ".combined experimental data for the @xmath66 cross section from aleph , delphi , l3 , opal at lep2 energies ( in gev ) .",
    "@xmath67 is the cut in the invariant mass of the tau pair . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tabla2 ]    all data are used independently in the global fit discussed in the final section . just as an example of",
    "how well the new couplings can be bound from lep2 let us find the limits on @xmath68 obtained by using only the data at @xmath69  gev .",
    "the experimental value for the ratio @xmath70 is in this case : @xmath71 to be compared with the theoretical prediction ( assuming that @xmath60 is well bounded from lep1-sld , as it is ) @xmath72 from the two previous equations we find : @xmath73 this @xmath74 bound is comparable to the one obtained in the global fit given in the final section where all available data have been included .",
    "chirality flipping observables vanish for massless taus and depend linearly on magnetic moments . on the other hand they will not get contributions from physics conserving chirality . in that sense they are truly magnetic moment observables . at lep1 , with the @xmath75 direction fully reconstructed in the semi - leptonic",
    "decays it has been shown@xcite that one can measure the anomalous weak magnetic moment @xmath8 by measuring an azimuthal asymmetry on the tau and tau decay products angles .",
    "this asymmetry selects the leading term in the weak magnetic moment in the tau pair production cross section , that appears in the p - odd , chirality flipping transverse tau polarization .",

    "note that even though the transverse tau polarization has been measured at lep1-sld with a precision one order of magnitude worse than the universality test @xmath86 ( 2 - 4% typically for the asymmetry , and 0.5% for the tau - muon cross section ratio ) , the obtained bound eq .",
    "( [ eq : ass1 ] ) is as good as the one coming from universality eq .",
    "( [ eq : ratiocross1limit ] ) .",
    "this is so because the asymmetry depends linearly on the couplings . at present there",
    "does not exists a similar measurement at lep2 .",
    "this would allow to disentangle the @xmath87 components from the @xmath36 components of the magnetic moments .",
    "the lagrangian eq .",
    "( [ eq : leff_fin ] ) shows that the same couplings that give rise to electromagnetic and @xmath36-boson magnetic moments , also contribute to the couplings of the @xmath11 gauge bosons to tau leptons .",
    "the couplings appear in a different combination than that in the photon or @xmath36 couplings , so their study gives additional independent information on magnetic moment couplings . as was noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite the best place to look for effects of the @xmath88 coupling is in the @xmath11 decay widths .    using our effective lagrangian",
    "we can easily compute the ratio of the decay width of the w - gauge boson in tau - leptons ( with magnetic moments ) to the decay width of the w to electrons ( without magnetic moments ) .",

    "note that @xmath92 , like the cross sections studied in subsection ( 1 ) , is a chirality even observable .",
    "the decay of the @xmath11 into leptons has been measured to a rather good precision at lep2 , ua1 , ua2 , cdf and d0 .",
    "there , results are presented in the form of universality tests on the couplings @xcite that we rewrite as a measurement on the ratio @xmath92 defined above @xmath93 then , from , we obtain the following limit on the @xmath11-boson magnetic moments . @xmath94",
    "we have performed a global fit , as a function of the two independent couplings @xmath91 and @xmath83 , to the studied observables :    * lepton universality @xmath95 at lep1 and sld ; * the ratio of cross sections @xmath96 , for the two highest energies measured at lep2 ; * the transverse tau polarization and polarization asymmetry @xmath97 measured at sld and lep1 ; * lepton universality of w decays @xmath98 measured at lep2 and @xmath9 colliders .       regions coming from the different experiments : solid ( lep2 - 189 gev ) , dashed ( lep1-sld cross section ) , dot - dashed ( asymmetry ) .",

    "this relationship appears when only the operator @xmath101 contributes .",

    ", @xmath8 @xmath102 using the relationship among @xmath91 , @xmath83 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 at a given value of the scale of new physics , one can easily obtain bounds on @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "alternatively , by assuming that @xmath103 or @xmath104 are order unity one finds a bound on the scale of new physics : @xmath105  tev .",

    "the interpretation of off - shell form factors is problematic since they can hardly be isolated from the other contributions and gauge invariance can be a problem . in the effective lagrangian approach all those problems",
    "are solved because form factors are directly related to couplings in the effective lagrangian , which is gauge invariant , and as discussed above , the difference @xmath42 only comes from higher dimension operators whose effect is suppressed by @xmath43 . using this approach , the analysis of the l3 and opal collaborations lead to the pdg @xmath108 cl limit@xcite : @xmath109 as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : final2sigma ] ) our result , coming mainly from lep2 , is about one order of magnitude better than the ones obtained from the radiative @xmath36-decay .",
    "the above bounds are completely model independent and no assumption has been made on the relative size of couplings @xmath23 and @xmath24 in the effective lagrangian ( [ eq : leff ] ) . for the sake of comparison with published data @xcite we present now the limits that can be found by considering separately only operator @xmath101 or only operator @xmath110 in the lagrangian ( [ eq : leff ] ) .",
    "consider that only @xmath101 is present , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , is equivalent to impose the relation @xmath111 or equivalently @xmath112 .",
    "thus , from fig .  [",
    "fig : gfit ] , it is straightforward to obtain that the bounds on the anomalous magnetic moment ( at @xmath113 ) are reduced to @xmath114 , while little change is found on the weak - magnetic moment @xmath115 .",
    "universality tests in @xmath11 decays do not provide any interesting constraint on @xmath8 and @xmath7 .",
    "in fact , the straight lines coming from the direct 1@xmath99 bound from universality tests in @xmath11 decays lie well outside the figure .",
    "however , because of the relationship ( [ eq : epsilonw ] ) , the lep1-sld and lep2 constraints on @xmath60 and @xmath68 can be translated into constraints on @xmath88 ( or @xmath37 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : moments ] ) ) , the weak magnetic moment couplings of the @xmath11-gauge - boson to taus and neutrinos .",
