    "due to its obvious importance for applications , the response of polyelectrolytes to external electric fields has been of high scientific interest for the last few decades , e.g. ,  @xcite . moreover , novel experimental techniques that allow exploration of a single polymer chain aided developments in this area @xcite .",
    "in fact , the ability of polyelectrolyte chains to adapt their conformation in external electric fields , i.e. , to change between expanded and contracted states when the applied field varies , is an important property .",
    "it may be used in future nano - machinery : possible examples of such nano - devices may be nano - vices or nano - nippers manipulated by an electric field .",
    "suppose one end of a chain is fixed on a plane ( i.e. , the polyelectrolyte is grafted ) , while the other end is linked to a nano - sized ( target ) body that can suffer deformation .",
    "if the polyelectrolyte is exposed to an external electric field that favors adsorption at the grafting plane , its conformation will be determined by both the field and the restoring force exerted by the deformed target body on the chain , see fig . [",
    "fig : spring_up ] . increased adsorption of the polyelectrolyte in response to a changing electric field will cause a deformation of the target body and give rise to a force acting between the chain and target .",
    "more precisely , the force will depend both on the magnitude of the deformation and the specific force - deformation relation of the target body .",
    "hence , by applying an electric field , one can manipulate the conformation of polyelectrolyte chains as well as the force affecting the target body .",
    "the nature of target bodies may be rather different , however , the most important ones with respect to possible applications seem to be either polymer chains or nano - particles , e.g. , colloidal particles , see figs . [",
    "fig : spring_up ] and [ fig : spring_down ] . in the latter case",
    "the force - deformation relation is given by the hertzian law , which accurately describes the elastic response of squeezed nano - particles @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , polymer chains can exhibit coiled states with a linear force - deformation relation or stretched conformations with a non - linear relation , e.g. @xcite . to describe the phenomenon it is necessary to express the size of the polyelectrolyte chain as well as the force acting on the target body as a function of the applied electric field .    in the present study",
    "we address the problem theoretically and numerically by means of molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations .",
    "we analyze a model of a polyelectrolyte chain grafted to a plane , linked by its free end to a deformable target body and exposed to an external electric field .",
    "the target body is modeled by linear or non - linear springs with corresponding force - deformation relations .",
    "a time - independent electric field is applied perpendicular to the grafting plane so that it favors complete polyelectrolyte adsorption on the plane . for simplicity",
    "we consider a salt - free solution , i.e. , there are only counterions that compensate the charge of the chain . for intermediate and strong electric fields ( the definition is given below ) , additional salt leads to a renormalization of the surface charge .",
    "this happens because the salt co - ions simply screen the plane leaving the qualitative nature of the phenomenon unchanged .",
    "hence the salt - free case addressed here is the basic one , which allows a simpler analytical treatment .",
    "the general case of a solution with additional salt ions will be studied elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "counterions having the same charge sign as the grafting plane are repelled , leaving the chain unscreened see ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spring_up ] ) .",
    "this feature is dominating if the specific volume per chain is not small and the electric field is not weak . in weak fields a noticeable fraction of counterions",
    "is located close to the chain , which leads to a partial screening of the external field and of the coulomb interactions between monomers .",
    "here we consider systems with a large specific volume and with fields that are not very weak .",
    "the screening of the chain in this case may be treated as a small perturbation .",
    "we study the static case when the current across the system is zero .",
    "it is noteworthy that for the specific volumes and magnitudes of the electric field addressed here , md simulations demonstrate a lack of the counterion screening even at finite electric current  @xcite .     of the deformed target body ( up arrows ) can be both linear and nonlinear , depending on the nature of the target body .",
    "the right panel shows that the target body is modelled by a spring . ]    here we present a first - principle theory of the phenomena and compare theoretical predictions with md simulations results .",
    "we observe a quantitative agreement between theory and md data for all magnitudes of electric field , except very weak fields when screening of the polyelectrolyte becomes significant .",
    "the simpler problem of the conformation of a grafted polyelectrolyte exposed to a constant force in electric field , has been explored theoretically and numerically in a previous study  @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite we also reported some simulation results for a chain linked to a deformable target body along with our previous simpler theory for the restoring force . in the present study",
    "we develop a first - principle theory , based on a unified approach that describes the adsorbed part of the chain as well as the bulk part under the action of the force from the target body",
    ".     corresponds in this case to the hertzian response of a compressed sphere . to illustrate a possible device ,",
    "two polyelectrolyte chains are sketched , although only one chain , linked to the hertzian spring , was used in the simulations reported , see the right panel . ]",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we present our analytical theory , where we calculate the free energy of the chain and the force acting on the target body . in section",
    "iii the numerical setup is discussed and in section iv we present the md results and compare them with our theoretical predictions . finally , in section v we summarize our findings .",
    "we consider a system , composed of a chain of @xmath0 monomers , which is anchored to a planar surface at @xmath1 .",
    "the anchoring end - monomer is uncharged , while each of the remaining @xmath2 beads carries the charge @xmath3 ( @xmath4 is the elementary charge ) ; @xmath2 counterions of charge @xmath5 make the system neutral . the external electric field @xmath6 acts perpendicular to the plane and favors the adsorption of the chain , fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] .",
    "the free end of the polyelectrolyte is linked to a deformable body , modeled by a spring with various force - deformation relations .",
    "we study a few different cases .",
    "the reaction force @xmath7 and the energy of deformation @xmath8 for a linear spring reads :    [ eq:1 ] f=-(h- h_0 ) , u_sp= ( h- h_0)^2 . here",
    "@xmath9 is the elastic constant of the spring and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the lengths of deformed and undeformed spring , respectively .",
    "a linear force - deformation relation corresponds , for instance , to a target body given by a polymer chain in coiled gaussian state , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding relation for a non - linear spring has the form    [ eq:2 ] f=|h- h_0 |^ sign(h_0-h ) , u_sp= |h- h_0 |^+1 , where @xmath12 characterizes the stiffness of the body , which may be e.g. a polymer chain in a semi - stretched conformational state , i.e. , in a state intermediate between a coiled and stretched one .",
    "it is known that stretched polymer chains demonstrate much larger stiffness than gaussian ones  @xcite . hence , varying the exponent @xmath13 one can mimic different states of a chain . from the point of view of applications",
    "it is worthwhile studying the special case of a hertzian spring with @xmath14 , which corresponds to the elastic response of a squeezed nano - particle  @xcite , e.g. , a colloidal particle :    [ eq:3 ] f=(h_0-h)^3/2(h_0-h ) , u_sp= ( h_0-h)^5/2 ( h_0-h ) . here",
    "@xmath15 is the diameter of an unloaded colloidal particle and @xmath10 that of the deformed one .",
    "the unit heaviside step function @xmath16 reflects the fact that the hertzian elastic respond arises for compressive deformations only .",
    "although we performed md simulations only for the above models of the elastic response , the theoretical analysis is given for the general case :    [ eq : uspgen ] u_sp = u_sp(h- h_0 ) f=- u_sp(h- h_0 ) , where again @xmath11 and @xmath10 are the sizes of undeformed and deformed target bodies , respectively .    to find the polyelectrolyte conformation in electric field and the force acting on the target body we evaluate the conditional free energy of the system and minimize it with respect to relevant variables .",
    "let the number of ( charged ) monomers adsorbed at the ( oppositely charged ) plane be @xmath17 , so that @xmath18 is the number of monomers in the bulk .",
    "let @xmath19 be the distance of the `` free '' chain end , linked to the target body , from the charged plane and @xmath20  the end - to - end distance of the adsorbed polymer part of @xmath17 monomers . in what follows we",
    "compute the conditional free energy @xmath21 which may be written as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the free energy of the system associated with the bulk part of the chain and the target body , @xmath24 is the free energy of the adsorbed part of the chain and @xmath25 accounts for the interactions between the bulk and adsorbed parts . minimizing then @xmath21 with respect to @xmath26 , @xmath19 and",
    "@xmath27 one can find the conformation of the chain and the force acting on the target body ( see the detailed discussion below ) .    in the present study we focus on the range of parameters where the polyelectrolyte chain is weekly screened .",
    "this allows us to treat the interaction of the chain with counterions as a small perturbation and estimate it separately ; this significantly simplifies calculations . in what follows",
    "we compute separately different parts of the free energy .      for simplicity , we use the freely jointed chain model with @xmath28 being the length of the inter - monomer links , that is , the size of the monomer beads . the md simulations discussed bellow provide a justification for this model .",
    "the location of all monomers of the chain is determined by @xmath2 vectors @xmath29 , which join the centers of @xmath30-st and @xmath31-th monomers ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "it is convenient to enumerate the monomers , starting from the `` free '' end linked to the target body .",
    "then the beads with numbers @xmath33 refer to the bulk part of the chain and with numbers @xmath34 to the adsorbed part .",
    "the @xmath0-st neutral bead is anchored to the surface .",
    "let the centers of the adsorbed beads lie at the plane @xmath1 ,   and for simplicity the anchored bead is located at the origin , @xmath35 .",
    "then the location of the @xmath36-th bead of the bulk part ( @xmath37 may be written as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the radius vector of the @xmath40-st bead , which is a surface bead ; it is linked to the @xmath26-th bead , located in the bulk .",
    "the inter - center distance of @xmath31-th and @xmath41-th beads reads , @xmath42 where each of the vectors @xmath43 has the same length @xmath28 .",
    "its orientation may be characterized by the polar @xmath44 and azimuthal @xmath45 angles , where the axis @xmath46 is directed perpendicularly to the grafting plane , fig .  [ fig : setup ] .",
    "hence , the distances between the reference plane @xmath1 and the @xmath36-th bead , as well as between the plane and the top bead are @xmath47 the location of the top bead , linked to the target body , @xmath19 determines its deformation and the elastic energy due to the body deformation , @xmath48 here @xmath49 is the location of the top bead of the chain when the target body is not deformed .",
    "because the chain is assumed to be weakly screened , here we ignore screening effects , which we estimate later as a perturbation .",
    "then the potential of the external field @xmath50 depends on @xmath51 simply as @xmath52 , so that the electrostatic energy of @xmath36-th bead , associated with this field reads @xmath53 .",
    "hence the interaction energy of the bulk part of the chain with the external field has the form    @xmath54    now we need to take into account the electrostatic interactions between chain monomers . because of vanishing screening we have , @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the dielectric permittivity of the solution .",
    "using the fourier transform of the coulomb potential @xmath57 , and the expression ( [ eq : rkl ] ) for the inter - monomer distances , the last equation may be recast into the form ( see the appendix a ) : @xmath58 where @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , @xmath62 are respectively the transverse and longitudinal ( parallel to the axis @xmath46 ) components of the vectors @xmath63 and @xmath43 .    in the following we",
