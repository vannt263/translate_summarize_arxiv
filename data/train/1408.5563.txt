    "among the heavy quarkona , the @xmath15 meson being the unique meson with two different heavy quarks in the standard model has aroused great interest since its discovery by the cdf collaboration @xcite . although the  direct \" hadronic production of the @xmath15 meson has been systematically studied in refs .",
    "@xcite , as a compensation to understand the production mechanism and the @xmath15 meson properties , it would be helpful to study its production  indirectly \" through @xmath20(@xmath21)-quark , @xmath22-boson , and @xmath23-boson decays , as too many directly produced @xmath15 events shall be cut off by the trigging condition @xcite .",

    "meanwhile , it has been found that the higher excited states like @xmath24 and @xmath25 wave states can provide sizable contributions in the @xmath15 meson s indirect production through @xmath26-boson decay in ref .",
    "@xcite ; one should take these higher fock states contributions into account so as to make a better estimation with other indirect production mechanisms . therefore , to present a systematic study on higher fock states indirect production of @xmath15 meson indirect production through top",
    "quark decays under the nonrelativistic quantum chromodynamics framework ( nrqcd ) @xcite is one of the purposes of the present paper .    with the lhc running at the center - of - mass energy @xmath13 tev and luminosity raising up to @xmath12 , about @xmath27 @xmath20-quark or @xmath21-quark events per year",

    "this makes the lhc much better than tevatron , since more @xmath28-quark rare decays can be adopted for precise studies .",

    "their results show that large number of heavy quarkonium events through top quark decays can be found at lhc(slhc , dlhc , and tlhc , etc .",
    "@xcite ) , so these channels shall be helpful for studying heavy quarkonium properties .",
    "in addition to the production of the two color - singlet @xmath33 wave states @xmath34 and @xmath35 , naive nrqcd scaling rule shows that the production of the four color - singlet @xmath36-wave states @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( with @xmath39 ; @xmath40 ) shall also give sizable contributions in @xmath41\\rangle+w^{+}q$ ] , where @xmath8 stands for @xmath9 or @xmath10 quark accordingly .",

    "so , it would be interesting to study higher fock states contributions so as to make a more sound estimation of the production of the heavy quarkonium through top quark decays , and hence to be a useful reference for experimental studies .    in the framework of an effective theory of the nrqcd ,",
    "a doubly heavy meson system is considered as an expansion of various fock states . the relative importance among those infinite ingredients",
    "is evaluated by the velocity scaling rule . in evaluating the production and decay amplitude of the heavy quarkonium",
    ", each factor can be separated into a short - distance factor and a long - distance coefficient .",
    "the short - distance factor can be computed using perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) , and the long - distance factor is associated with quarkonia structure , which is expressed in terms of nonperturbative matrix elements @xmath43 .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath44 can be expressed in terms of the meson s nonrelativistic wave function , or its derivatives , evaluated at the origin under the color - singlet model @xcite , and the wave function is identified with the schr@xmath0dinger wave function calculated in potential models for heavy quarkonium . as a result ,",
    "the rigorously calculated nonrelativistic wave function at the origin is very important in studying heavy quarkonium decay and production .    because of the emergence of massive fermion lines in @xmath41\\rangle+w^{+}q$ ] , the analytical expression for the squared amplitude becomes too complex and lengthy .",
    "for such complicated processes , one important way out is to deal with it directly at the amplitude level . for this purpose ,",
    "the  improved trace technology \" suggested and developed by refs .",
    "@xcite shows that the hard scattering amplitude can also be expressed by the dot products of the concerned particle momenta like that of the squared amplitudes . in the present paper",
