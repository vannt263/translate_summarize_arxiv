    "we used @xmath176 as barrier , however we can not define @xmath4-shifted convex hull @xmath242 by definition . instead of @xmath242 , we define @xmath243 where @xmath244 . then for any @xmath245 , @xmath246 .",
    "let @xmath245 and @xmath247 , and define the sequence @xmath146 of compact @xmath56-hypersurfaces with @xmath248 as before .",

    ", any subsequence of @xmath262 will have a limit point in @xmath0 .",
    "hence @xmath146 can not escape to the infinity , and we have a nonempty limit .",
    "hence , the proof in previous part goes through , and a subsequence @xmath148 converges to a minimizing @xmath4-hypersurface @xmath240 with @xmath241 .",
    "now , this gives a contradiction as there can not be a @xmath4-hypersurface in @xmath0 because of the horospheres ( @xmath263-hypersurfaces ) , and the maximum principle .",

    "let @xmath265 be the horospheres in @xmath0 with @xmath266 and @xmath267 is the radius of the horosphere in euclidean metric on @xmath92 in poincare ball model ( hence , @xmath268 ) .",

    "in other words , in this section , we will show that the star - shapedness condition on @xmath3 in previous section is not essential , but bounding a unique cmc hypersurface for any @xmath8 is the key condition .",

    "the estimate @xmath279 implies that for sufficiently small @xmath280 , @xmath281 where @xmath282 and @xmath119 .",

    "let @xmath285 and @xmath286 .",
    "also , let @xmath287 be the region which @xmath180 separates in @xmath288 where the mean curvature vector on @xmath180 points outside of @xmath287 ( without loss of generality , we assume @xmath289 . if both negative , just change the direction .",
    "if different signs , same argument works as area minimizing hypersurface @xmath290 would be a barrier between them @xcite ) . an alternative way to think about this picture is the poincare ball model in @xmath0 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "hence , if we can show that @xmath291 is strictly included in @xmath292 , we are done ( @xmath293 can not touch @xmath294 because of maximum principle , lemma 2.1 ) .",
    "this is because this implies @xmath295 , and we already know @xmath296 is disjoint from @xmath297 by @xcite .    .",
    "assume that @xmath298 .",
    "since @xmath115 are minimizing @xmath299-hypersurfaces , then so is @xmath180 , and hence @xmath300 are minimizers for the functional @xmath181 for the fixed boundary @xmath196 .",
    "consider @xmath301 and @xmath302 which is another hypersurface in @xmath288 with @xmath303 .",
    "let @xmath304 .",

    "this implies @xmath318 which is a contradiction .    in a sense , this lemma is a generalization of lemma 3.1 .",
    "now , we generalize theorem 3.3 .",
    "the technique is basically same .",
    "let @xmath3 be a @xmath5 closed codimension-1 submanifold in @xmath2 .",
    "if for any @xmath132 , there exists a unique cmc hypersurface @xmath6 with @xmath14 , then , the collection of cmc hypersurfaces @xmath9 with @xmath8 foliates @xmath0 .    by lemma 4.1 ,",
    "@xmath134 for @xmath133 . by using lemma 4.1 instead of lemma 3.1 ,",
    "the proof of step 1 of theorem 3.3 adapts to this case easily , hence there can not be any gap in the collection @xmath9 . similarly , the proof of step 2 of theorem 3 also goes through in this case , and this shows @xmath9 fill out the whole @xmath0 .",
    "the proof follows .",
    "first we should note that nelli - spruck s uniqueness result does not automatically give a foliation when it is combined with our result .",
    "@xcite let @xmath22 be a @xmath5 mean convex domain in @xmath2 and @xmath319 .",
    "then for each @xmath320 there exists a complete embedded hypersurface @xmath31 of @xmath0 of constant mean curvature @xmath27 with @xmath321 .",
    "moreover , @xmath31 can be represented as a graph @xmath322 over @xmath22 with @xmath323 and there is a unique such a graph .",
    "unfortunately , this result for @xmath5 mean convex domains does not give uniqueness in general .",
    "other than the obvious reason @xmath320 , it only asserts the uniqueness of the graphs , where there still might be other cmc hypersurfaces which may not be represented as graph .",
    "so , for this case , theorem 4.2 can not be applied directly .",
    "however , for the question whether the collection of cmc hypersurfaces @xmath324 in the theorem above is a foliation of graphs or not , our techniques might be used , if one can show that the pairwise disjointness of the graphs , and that the limit of the graphs is also a graph in that setting .",
    "hence , with pairwise disjointness , the only possibility not to have a foliation would be to have a gap , but the existence of a gap in the foliation would contradict the uniqueness of graphs in the theorem above .    for the nonexistence question , by using the techniques of @xcite ,",
    "it is possible to show the existence of a simple closed curve @xmath3 in @xmath11 such that there is no foliation of @xmath10 by cmc hypersurfaces @xmath9 with @xmath7 .",
    "in particular , such a foliation implies the uniqueness of not only minimizing cmc hypersurfaces , but also any type of cmc hypersurfaces with asymptotic boundary @xmath3 . in dimension @xmath325 , by hass s result in @xcite and anderson s result in @xcite , there are examples of jordan curves in @xmath11 bounding many minimal surfaces in @xmath10 .",
    "hence , for those curves in @xmath11 , there can not be a foliation of @xmath10 by cmc surfaces because of the maximum principle .",
    "on the other hand , recently in @xcite , wang showed that if a quasi - fuchsian @xmath325-manifold @xmath31 contains a minimal surface whose principle curvature is less than @xmath4 , than @xmath31 admits a foliation by cmc surfaces by using volume preserving mean curvature flow .",
    "if we lift this foliation to the universal cover , we get a foliation of @xmath10 by cmc surfaces with same asymptotic boundary which is the limit set of @xmath31 .",
    "however , the limit set of quasi - fuchsian manifolds are far from being smooth , even they contain no rectifiable arcs ( @xcite ) .",
    "existence of one smooth point in the limit set implies the group being fuchsian , which means the limit set is a round circle in @xmath11 .",
    "even though the foliation constructed in @xcite induces a foliation of @xmath10 by cmc surfaces , since the limit sets in @xmath11 are nonrectifiable , wang s results and the results in this paper should be considered in different contexts .",
    "also in @xcite , wang constructs a limit set @xmath3 of a quasi - fuchsian 3-manifold which is similar to the one in @xcite , where there can not be a foliation of @xmath10 by cmc surfaces with asymptotic boundary @xmath3 .",
    "this also implies the existence of a quasi - fuchsian @xmath325-manifold which has no foliation by cmc surfaces .",
