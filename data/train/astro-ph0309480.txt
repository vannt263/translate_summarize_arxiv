    "there exist different ways to determine the baryonic density of the universe .",
    "the `` traditional method '' is standard big - bang nucleosynthesis ( sbbn ) which is based on nuclear physics in the early universe .",
    "this calculation reproduces the primordial light element ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2  and , ) abundances over an interval of 10 orders of magnitude .",
    "recently , however , the study of the cosmic microwave radiation ( cmb ) anisotropies and the census of the lyman@xmath8  forest at high redshift have provided new methods to obtain @xmath3 . in the case of the cmb , the baryonic parameter ( @xmath3 , where @xmath10 is the hubble parameter expressed in units of 100 @xmath11 ) is extracted from the amplitudes of the acoustic peaks in the angular power spectrum of the anisotropies . the @xmath3  values deduced from these three different methods are in rather good agreement but may not be totally model independent .",
    "a series of data have been released by many experiments , but very recently , the wmap mission has delivered a wealth of results , based on the first year of observations ( spergel et al .",
    "the mean value @xmath3=0.024@xmath120.001 agrees with the previous estimates but the error bar is considerably reduced . when including constraints from other observations at complementary angular scales , the value @xmath3=0.0224@xmath120.0009 is obtained ( spergel et al . 2003 ) , setting stringent constraints on the general discussion of the bbn scenario .    in the case of the lyman@xmath8  forest ,",
    "the baryonic density is deduced from the study of the atomic hi and heii lyman@xmath8  absorption lines observed on the line of sight to quasars ( baryonic matter distributed on large scales , in the redshift range 0@xmath135 ) . indeed , this evaluation , though indirect",
    "because of the relatively large ionization uncertainties , leads to results consistent with the two other methods ( @xmath3@xmath140.02 , riedeger et al .",
    "however , the baryonic density obtained in this way carries a relatively large error bar , which in the present context makes it less constraining .",
    "consequently , due to the large efforts made recently to determine the cosmological parameters , it is now mandatory to refine the bbn analysis . in this paper , we update the study performed in coc et al .",
    "( 2002 ) where we had exploited a set of reaction rates from the nacre compilation ( angulo et al .",
    "we reconsider here the bbn calculation using reaction rates obtained from a new analysis of the ten most important nuclear reactions ( descouvemont et al .",
    "2003 , hereafter daa ) .",
    "moreover , we consider the impact on the bbn results of these main reactions and , at the same time , study other reactions which could be potentially important for sbbn .    after a summary of the observational data concerning the light isotope abundances and the new nuclear input , we use monte  carlo calculations to obtain the abundances of light nuclei ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2  and , ) versus the baryon to photon ratio , taking into account the uncertainties on nuclear reaction rates . we discuss both agreements and discrepancies confronting calculations , abundance data and wmap results .",
    "the observation of the most primitive astrophysical sites in which abundances can be measured and their confrontation to the bbn calculations allow to extract @xmath3 . for a general discussion on the updated observational data , see the review of olive ( 2003 ) .",
    "the primordial @xmath2  abundance , @xmath15 , is derived from observations of metal  poor , extragalactic , ionized hydrogen ( hii ) regions .",
    "we adopt here the two recent values of izotov et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , ( @xmath16 ) and luridiana et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , ( @xmath17 ) , giving a relatively large range of abundance for this isotope . indeed ,",
    "when considering systematic uncertainties , fields and olive ( 1998 ) obtain the range @xmath18 ,    deuterium is particularly fragile and is only destroyed in stellar processes .",
    "hence , the primordial abundance should be represented , in principle , by the highest value observed in remote cosmological clouds on the line of sight of high redshift quasars .",
    "this is what we adopted in coc et al .",
    "( 2002 ) ( hereafter cv )",
    ". however , recently , kirkman et al . (",
    "2003 ) have obtained a new measurement of @xmath19 and @xmath20 = -2.79\\pm0.05 $ ] .",
    "they give also their best estimate of the primordial d abundance , averaging individual measurements toward five qsos , namely @xmath21 that we now adopt here .",
    "however , as the sample of cosmological clouds is very limited and the systematic errors on @xmath4 values are hard to estimate , this value has to be considered with caution .",
    "indeed , crighton et al .",
    "( 2003 ) highlight important aspects of the analysis which were not explored in previous works showing that the methods used in analyses of @xmath4 in quasar spectra should be improved .",
    "for example , according to different hypotheses about contamination , they show that @xmath4 in the absorber toward qso pg 1718 + 4807 can be as high as @xmath22 or significantly lower than @xmath23 .    since the discovery of the spite plateau ( spite and spite 1982 ) , namely the constant lithium abundance as a function of metallicity",
    ", many new observations have strengthened its existence .",
    "ryan et al .",
    "( 1999 , 2000 ) have obtained a tight limit on the plateau abundance .",
    "specifically , these authors take into account all possible contributions from extrapolation to zero metallicity , ,  depletion mechanisms and biases in the analysis . their extrapolated value ( at 95% confidence level )",
    "is : @xmath24 = @xmath25 .",
    "recently , thvenin et al . (",
    "2001 ) have obtained vlt - uves high resolution spectra of seven metal poor stars in the globular cluster , ngc 6397 .",
    "their mean value of lithium , a(li)= 2.23@xmath120.07 , is consistent with the preceding one .",
    "bonifacio et al .",
    "( 2002 ) who have also observed this globular cluster , obtain a higher mean value : a(li ) = 2.34 @xmath120.056 .",
    "the difference between these two evaluations lies in the different effective temperatures adopted .",
    "indeed , these two independent observations and analyses give an indication of the systematic errors involved in @xmath24 determination .",
    "both observers and experts of stellar atmospheres agree to consider that the abundance determination in halo stars , and more particularly that of lithium require a sophisticated analysis . in this respect ,",
    "the temperature scale is influential and it is possible that the scale adopted by ryan et al .",
    "( 2000 ) underestimates the @xmath24 ratio .",
    "moreover , the determination of @xmath24 in stars embedded in globular clusters is more questionable that in the halo field stars since globular cluster stars may be polluted by their environment .",
    "so , it would be necessary to select in a first step , star by star , those which are the less contaminated , i.e. , the most adequate to give a reliable @xmath24 abundance .",
    "note , however , that stars from small globular clusters ( as ngc 6397 ) are representative of the halo stars ( cayrel , private communication ) .",
    "in addition to the ryan et al .",
    "range , adopted here as in cv , we will also consider , conservatively , the upper limit of the bonifacio et al .",
    "( 2002 ) value , namely @xmath26 .",
    "note however that these globular cluster determinations , at [ fe / h]@xmath27 - 2 , can not be directly compared to the ryan et al .",
    "( 2000 ) extrapolated value .",
    "@xmath1 has been measured recently by bania et al .",
    "( 2002 ) in hii regions , but due to the large scatter in the data and the complex galactic history of this isotope , we can not consider it as a good cosmological tracer ( vangioni - flam et al . 2003 ) .",
    "in our previous work ( cv ) , we performed monte - carlo calculations to obtain statistical limits on the calculated abundances , using mainly the nacre compilation of reaction rates ( angulo et al .",
    "one of the main innovative features of nacre with respect to former compilations ( caughlan and fowler 1988 , hereafter cf88 ) is that uncertainties are analyzed in detail and realistic lower and upper bounds for the rates are provided .",
    "however , since it is a general compilation for multiple applications , coping with a broad range of nuclear configurations , these bounds have not always been evaluated through a rigorous statistical methodology .",
    "hence , in cv , a simple uniform distribution between these bounds was assumed for the monte  carlo calculations .",
    "since this compilation was not specifically addressed to the nuclear reactions implied in the bbn it had also to be complemented by other sources ( smith et al .",
    "1993 , brune et al .",
    "two recent sbbn calculations have been made with updated reaction rates , one based on the nollett and burles ( 2000 ) compilation ( hereafter nb ) and another ( cyburt et al .",
    "2001 ; hereafter cfo ) on a partial , reanalysis the nacre compiled data .",
    "these works ( nb and cfo ) have given better defined statistical limits for the reaction rates of interest for sbbn .",
    "one ( nb ) has used spline functions to fit the astrophysical @xmath28factors ( see definition in cv ) while the other ( cfo ) have used the nacre @xmath28factors with a different normalization ( restricted to bbn energies . ) in nacre , data are in general fitted either by breit ",
    "wigner formula ( the shape of nuclear resonances ) or by low order polynomial for non - resonant contributions .",
    "indeed , unlike in cfo , the fits are not restricted to the energy range of bbn , taking advantage of all data to constrain the nuclear factor .",
    "the use of low order polynomials , or better theoretical @xmath28factors shapes , rather than e.g. splines , has the advantage of smoothing out the dispersion of data arising from the measurement technique itself rather than from physics when no sharp resonance is expected in the energy domain .",
    "consequently , the cfo global normalization factors are different from those of nacre .",
    "one should note , however , the isotope yields obtained from bbn calculations using the two compilations ( nacre and nb ) agree well , reinforcing the confidence in these analyses .",
    "nevertheless , in order to improve on the general nacre compilation , daa have reassessed carefully the main nuclear network ( ten reactions ) on the basis of an r - matrix analysis .",
    "the r  matrix theory has been used for many decades in the nuclear physics community .",
    "it allows to parametrize nuclear cross sections with a reduced set of parameters related to nuclear quantities such as resonance energies and partial widths .",
    "this method can be used for both resonant and non - resonant contributions to the cross section .",
    "( see daa and reference therein for details of the method . )",
    "the energy dependence of the fitted s - factors is now constrained by the coulomb functions and r - matrix poles , rather than by arbitrary polynomial or spline functions . even though this method has been widely used in nuclear astrophysics ( see e.g. barker & kajino 1991 for a recent application to a nuclear astrophysics problem ) , this is the first time that it is applied to sbbn reactions .",
    "in addition , this new compilation ( daa ) provides 1@xmath29 statistical limits for each of the 10 rates : @xmath30h(p,@xmath31he , @xmath30h(d , n)@xmath32he , @xmath30h(d , p)@xmath32h , @xmath32h(d , n)@xmath33he @xmath32h(@xmath34li , @xmath32he(n , p)@xmath32h , @xmath32he(d , p)@xmath33he , @xmath32he(@xmath34be , @xmath7li(p,@xmath35he and @xmath7be(n , p)@xmath7li .",
    "these rate limits are derived from the r  matrix parameter errors calculated during the fitting procedure ( see daa ) .",
    "the two remaining reactions of importance , n@xmath36p and @xmath37h(n,@xmath38h ( chen and savage 1999 ) come from theory and are unchanged with respect to cv .",
    "we have re  done our monte - carlo calculations using this time gaussian distributions with parameters provided by the new compilation ( daa ) discussed above .",
    "we have calculated the mean and the variance of the @xmath2 , @xmath0 , @xmath1  and ,  yields as a function of @xmath39 , fully consistent with our previous analysis ( cv ) . the differences with cfo for the",
    ",  yield is probably due to their renormalization procedure of nacre s  factors .",
    "figure  [ f : heli ] displays the resulting abundance limits ( 1-@xmath29 ) [ it was 2-@xmath29 in fig.4 of cv ] from sbbn calculations compared to primordial ones inferred from observations .",
    "it is important to note that the present results are in good agreement with cv . with these improved calculations",

    "more important , their predicted ,  ( @xmath49 ) is lower than our prediction ( about 11% ; see table  [ t : yields ] ) .",

    "<S> carlo technique , we calculate the abundances of light nuclei ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2  and , ) versus the baryon to photon ratio . the results concerning @xmath3  are compared to relevant astrophysical and cosmological observations : the abundance determinations in primitive media and the results from cmb experiments , especially the wmap mission . </S>",
    "<S> consistency between wmap , sbbn results and @xmath4 data strengthens the deduced baryon density and has interesting consequences on cosmic chemical evolution </S>",
    "<S> . a significant discrepancy between the calculated ,  deduced from wmap and the spite plateau is clearly revealed . to explain this discrepancy three possibilities </S>",
    "<S> are invoked : systematic uncertainties on the @xmath5 abundance , surface alteration of @xmath5 in the course of stellar evolution or poor knowledge of the reaction rates related to @xmath6 destruction . in particular , the possible role of the up to now neglected @xmath7be(d , p)2@xmath8 and @xmath7be(d,@xmath8)@xmath9li reactions is considered . another way to reconciliate these results coming from different horizons , consists to invoke , speculative , new primordial physics which could modify the nucleosynthesis emerging from the big bang and perhaps the cmb physics itself . </S>",
    "<S> the impressive advances in cmb observations provide a strong motivation for more efforts in experimental nuclear physics and high quality spectroscopy to keep bbn in pace . </S>"
