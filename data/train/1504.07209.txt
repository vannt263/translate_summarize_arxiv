    "a major fact in the theory of critical phenomena is that the scale invariance exhibited by systems at criticality @xcite when combined with a local action may give rise to invariance under the larger group of conformal transformation which locally acts as scale transformation @xcite .",
    "although being scale invariant and having a local action is not in general equivalent to being conformal invariant , since there are scale invariant local models which are not conformal invariant @xcite and non - local models possessing conformal invariance @xcite , it is widely believed to hold true for many models of physical interest .",
    "the conformal group in @xmath0 spatial dimensions ( for @xmath1 ) has a number of independent generators equal to @xmath2 .",
    "for the special case @xmath3 the conformal group turns out to be infinitely dimensional @xcite .",
    "this infinite dimensionality is indeed at the root of the success of conformal field theories in the study of two dimensional critical models . for higher dimensions the exploitation of conformal symmetry ( if present )",
    "leads nonetheless to important simplifications in the study of critical models . even though for a long lapse of time traditional techniques not explicitly incorporating conformal invariance were used for the study of critical phenomena ( such as the @xmath4-expansion @xcite ) , the last years witnessed the development in three dimensions of the so called conformal bootstrap program which , fully exploiting conformal invariance , has lead to high - precision nonperturbative predictions for anomalous scaling dimensions of the ising model in three dimensions @xcite and in fractional dimensions @xcite .",
    "the role of conformal symmetry in the theory of critical phenomena can thus be hardly underestimated .",
    "dating back to the polyakov s hypothesis of the conformal invariance of critical fluctuations @xcite and to the derivation under broad conditions in @xmath3 of ( conformal ) invariance under local changes of length scale from the ( scale ) invariance under rigid length scale changes @xcite , a significant amount of work was by then devoted to show with mostly analytical different techniques the possible existence of conformal symmetry at criticality in higher dimensions and its relation with the scale invariance .",
    "it was soon pointed out that unitarity is a key ingredient , with supersymmetric models in @xmath5 being an important example in which the conformal invariance was explicitly shown @xcite .",
    "always in @xmath5 a proof of conformal invariance within perturbation theory has been recently discussed @xcite . in @xmath6",
    "we mention the recent discussion of the occurrence of conformal invariance for the ising model at criticality using functional renormalization group techniques @xcite .    for two dimensional systems , complementary to analytical tools and techniques , an important role in elucidating the geometric aspects of universality and in testing the emergence and consequences of conformal",
    "invariance has been played by numerical simulations : in @xmath3 conformal symmetry has been extensively tested numerically ( see e.g. the early numerical experiments in @xcite and @xcite ) by confronting numerics with theoretical predictions arising from conformal field theory",
    ".    however , in other space dimensionlities these tests and numerical experiments are still partial .",
    "an active research line dates back to the paper @xcite , in which a relation among correlation functions defined on a flat @xmath0-dimensional geometry and a suitably chosen curved geometry ( the hypercylinder @xmath7 ) has been put forward , which in @xmath3 amounts to the conformal mapping between the ( both flat ) plane and cylinder geometries .",
    "this relation was originally verified for the spherical model for dimension @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "recent monte carlo numerical studies established the validity of this prediction for the three dimensional ising model @xcite : in these works a continuous limit of the lattice model was used to perform the simulations of the curved space and the assumption of conformal invariance , together with the determination of the magnetic and energy correlation lengths , was shown to be enough to correctly reproduce the known critical exponents .",
    "similar numerical computations were carried out for the three dimensional bond percolation @xcite and @xmath9 models @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to provide numerical evidence of the invariance of three dimensional critical systems under conformal transformations of the euclidean flat space ( more precisely , of the flat space into itself ) .",
    "for this reason we studied observables of three dimensional percolation at criticality , studying models both on lattice ( site percolation ) and on the continuum ( overlapping spheres ) .",
    "we decided to choose percolation for several reasons : percolation is possibly the simplest model exhibiting a phase transition , see e.g. @xcite and the recent review @xcite .",
    "this simplicity has on one side allowed to mathematically prove many conjectured properties of percolation such as the existence of a transition in the thermodynamic limit @xcite or , more recently , to prove rigorously @xcite many results from cft with help of of stochastic loewner evolution ( sle ) techniques @xcite . on the other hand , with the aid of powerful algorithms @xcite ,",
    "the numerical exploration of percolation problems is especially convenient .",
    "finally , it is clear that percolation is an ideal system to test conformal invariance in bounded domains , as convincingly showed for @xmath3 @xcite , since in a natural way one computes quantities defined and crucially dependent on the form of the boundaries , as the probability of connecting two disconnected regions of the boundary of the system .    with these motivations",
    ", we numerically study the presence of conformal invariance for three dimensional percolation at criticality in bounded domains .",
    "we introduce and study both discrete and continuous models of critical percolation , we test by numerical experiments the invariance of quantities in finite domains under conformal transformations by computing crossing probabilities .",
    "we also put forward an approximate expression for the crossing among spherical caps on a sphere and check it against numerical experiments finding very good agreement .",
    "our results show clear evidence of the onset of conformal invariance in finite realizations especially for the continuum percolation models .",
    "in its simplest incarnation percolation consists of filling a randomly and independently with probability @xmath10 the sites of a graph and checking for the existence of large clusters . as a testbed for the verification of conformal invariance we will consider a classical problem in percolation theory : the existence of a cluster connecting two disjoint regions @xmath11 and @xmath12 of the boundary of a bounded domain @xmath13 .",
    "the probability of the occurrence of this event is known ( and under some assumptions mathematically proven @xcite ) to tend , in the thermodynamic limit , to a nontrivial ( i.e. different from @xmath14 or @xmath15 ) value @xmath16 if the occupation probability @xmath10 is set to the critical probability @xmath17 . before introducing the finite realizations considered in this work ( this will be done in section [ percolation_models ] ) we explore in this section the geometric consequences of conformal invariance by working in the thermodynamic limit . due to universality",
    "these considerations do not depend on the specific model of percolation under scrutiny . in order to verify this model independence",
    "we will take two prototypical models of percolation : a discrete and a continuum one , i.e. site percolation and continuum percolation of penetrable spheres , with the notations introduced in this section being applicable to both models .",
    "the crossing probability has been the object of classical foundational papers @xcite for the application of conformal field theory in two dimensional critical systems . in the two dimensional case indeed full exploitation of the ( infinite dimensional ) conformal group",
    "has allowed to obtain the exact crossing probability for simply connected domains in the paper by cardy @xcite . in that setting the presence of boundaries",
    "gets translated , in the boundary cft language , into the insertion of boundary creating operators located at the points at the extremes of the one dimensional boundary .",
    "although many similar formulas in different and more complicated settings have been derived @xcite , some details of the operator content in percolation in two dimensions , which turns out to be a logarithmic cft , are still matter of investigation @xcite .    in our",
    "three dimensional setting the domain @xmath13 will be chosen as a simply connected closed domain and the two surface domains as intersection of the boundary @xmath18 and two closed domains @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "although the two domains @xmath19 and @xmath20 are not strictly needed to define of the regions @xmath11 @xmath12 they will come in handy to define unambiguously the finite lattice realization we will study numerically .    at criticality the crossing probability should take a value @xmath21 dependent on the three domains @xmath13 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 . please note that the actual value of @xmath21 _ does not _",
    "depend on the percolation model we are studying .",
    "this expectation has been numerically validated in widely different models in the two dimensional models and in some selected three dimensional cases @xcite .",
    "if we perform a conformal mapping @xmath22 the three domains get mapped onto the three domains @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the conformal invariance hypothesis implies that : @xmath26 note that in general conformal invariance would allow for dimensionful prefactors in front of depending on the geometry and on the scaling dimension of the observable under consideration . the further requirement on the crossing probability to be , as expected , a finite number in the thermodynamic limit forces us to set them to one . in the two dimensional case , using the cft language , the above statement can be expressed by saying that the boundary operators we insert to obtain the crossing probability are expected to have zero conformal weight . in three dimensions of course",
    "the interpretation of the boundary condition as insertion of boundary operators is lacking but the expectation of the crossing probability to have vanishing scaling dimension still holds .",
    "another observation is in order the above statements on implication of conformal invariance crucially depend on the choice of the boundary conditions chosen .",
    "indeed different boundary conditions can flow to @xcite renormalization group fixed points differing from the one encountered in the bulk systems .",
    "a study based on @xmath4-expansion of the effect of boundary conditions on the critical properties of percolation models in semi - infinite geometries has been carried out in @xcite .",
    "the boundary conditions we have chosen i.e. occupied for points in @xmath27 and free for the remaining part of the boundary are expected , in analogy to what observed in two dimension , to the so called ordinary fixed point .",
    "we recall that in three dimensional space the conformal group is 10-dimensional @xcite and is generated by the following generators ( acting on a three dimensional vector @xmath28 ) :    * 3 translations : @xmath29 * 1 dilatation : @xmath30 * 3 rotations : @xmath31 * 3 special conformal transformations : @xmath32    where @xmath33 denote the components of @xmath28 . indeed",
