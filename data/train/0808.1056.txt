    "the r - process is responsible for the synthesis of roughly half of all nuclei heavier than a@xmath270 and all of the actinides @xcite .",
    "the solar system r - process abundances act as the canonical constraint to r - process theories as well as the prime indicator of the success of r - process models .",
    "several r - process sites have been proposed ; the hot - bubble region of a type ii supernova ( snii ) has been modeled fairly successfully .",
    "the composition of the environment in which the r - process occurs might be expected to have a profound effect on the final abundance distribution .",
    "observations indicate that the r - process site is primary @xcite and further evidence may suggest that the r - process is also unique @xcite ; it may occur in a single site or event .",
    "the uniqueness of the r - process site , however , remains a subject of study @xcite .",
    "nuclear properties also constrain the r - process , and the purpose of this work is the examination of one particular characteristic - @xmath0-decay - as it relates to the r - process .",
    "the @xmath0-decay inputs , and other nuclear physics inputs , have been shown @xcite to have important effects on the success or failure of r - process models .",
    "this is somewhat unfortunate , as properties of only a few nuclei on the neutron closed shells closer to stability have been experimentally determined , while data for the rest are relegated to calculation @xcite . of paramount importance",
    "is the determination of nuclear masses and @xmath0-decay rates .",
    "nuclear mass formulae based on the microscopic properties of nuclei are slowly replacing the empirical droplet models , and these can change resulting reaction rates by factors as large as 10@xmath3 @xcite . as well , the r - process path is affected by the choice of mass formula , since the path roughly follows a line of constant s@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "a successful r - process calculation must predict an abundance peak for nuclei in the a@xmath2195 region - a difficulty over much of the r - process parameter space .",
    "however , as discussed below , @xmath0-decays from excited state nuclei may help to mitigate this difficulty .",
    "they do so by allowing the r - process to proceed at a faster rate , thereby enhancing the abundances at higher masses .    for the purposes of this study , the most recent semi",
    "- gross theory of @xmath0-decay @xcite has been adapted to neutron - rich nuclei relevant to the r - process .",
    "the ability of this model to determine decay properties of an extremely wide range of nuclei with reasonable accuracy and speed makes it ideal for this preliminary calculation .",
    "in particular , the semi - gross theory has good agreement for very neutron - rich nuclei @xcite .",
    "it has also been used to improve the accuracy of decay rates for astrophysical calculations by incorporating first - forbidden transition strengths @xcite . in its original form ,",
    "the gross theory of @xmath0-decay assumed that the energy states of a nucleus consist of a smoothed distribution with transition strengths that peak at or near the energy of the isobaric analog state @xcite .",
    "subsequent evolutions of the gross theory incorporated strength functions allowing for transitions of higher forbiddenness @xcite , as well as improvements over the original theory to include odd - odd effects @xcite , sum rules @xcite , even - odd mass differences @xcite , and improvements on the strength functions @xcite .    while the precision of the fermi gas model used is consistent with that of the gross theory itself , more accurate models might be used .",
    "recently , shell effects in the parent nucleons have been taken into account by using an energy distribution for single - particle states @xcite ; this is denoted as the `` semi - gross theory . '' in these models , the energy distribution of the daughter states is still assumed to be smooth .",
    "thus , the transition strength functions depend on the quantum numbers only of the initial parent states and are independent of the energy of the parent state ; transition types are based on a statistical weight for a particular parent state to make a particular type of transition .",
    "the advantage of using single - particle strength functions is that quantum numbers can be assigned to the states easily , lending a better notion of the actual strength of each type of transition involved .",
    "since decay rates of nearly all of the nuclei along the r - process path have yet to be studied in a laboratory , r - process calculations rely heavily on calculated decay rates .",
    "further , the temperature of the r - process environment (  10@xmath5k ) necessitates accounting for nuclei in excited states , especially given the expected high level density of these far - from - stability nuclei .",
    "some of the effects that might be expected if one considers excited state nuclei in r - process simulations include increased ( n,@xmath6 ) and ( @xmath6,n ) rates , which might shift the r - process path , but would tend to counteract each other as the r - process is generally presumed to proceed at ( n,@xmath6)@xmath7(@xmath6,n ) equilibrium , increased neutrino spallation rates , tending to enhance smoothing in post - processing , and increased beta - decay rates .",
    "however , at signicant excitation , neutron separation energies are low enough that neutron emission may be a dominant decay mode .",
    "this is discussed briefly along with the discussion of excited - state decays in the network calculation .",
    "section [ grosstheory ] of this paper is an overview of @xmath0-decay calculations and average properties in calculating decay rates calculated using the more recent semi - gross theory .",
    "this includes a brief review of the semi - gross theory of @xmath0-decay and a description of the calculations of single - particle states and their relationship to @xmath0-decay in  [ spstates ] .",
    "energy levels are calculated in  [ spcalc ] using the finite range droplet model ( frdm ) .",
    "results of @xmath0-decay calculations of excitated state nuclei with the adapted frdm are discussed in  [ results ] , along with their potential astrophysical importance .",
    "application of these results to an r - process network calculation is made in ",
    "[ r - process ] with results from a model with several environmental parameter sets described in  [ network_results ] .",
    "future work and possibilities are discussed in  [ conclusion ] , along with experimental possibilities .",
    "average theories of @xmath0-decay , such as the gross theory and the more recent semi - gross theory , make them useful in estimating and adapting decay rates of several nuclei to large systems such as astrophysical network calculations .",
    "the major assumption in these theories is that nuclear level densities are high enough to make integration over states a fairly accurate approximation by replacing the matrix elements with transition probability distribution functions .",
    "for example , the decay rate for fermi and gt transitions , as calculated in the gross theory by takahashi and yamada , is given by @xcite : @xmath8 which integrates over the product of the transition probability function @xmath9 between a parent nucleus state at energy @xmath10 and a daughter state with a transition energy @xmath11 , the density of states @xmath12 of the decaying nuclei ; the weighting function of the final state nucleus w(e,@xmath10 ) , which imposes the pauli exclusion principle on the rate calculation ; and the form factor f@xmath13(-e ) , which is the product of the emitted electron wave functions and the fermi function for a transition of type @xmath14 .",
    "terms used in the equations of this paper are summarized in tables [ terms ] - [ termsb ] .",
    "the density of parent states @xmath15 supplies information on the nucleons available for decay , while the weighting function controls the availability of the daughter states to which the nucleons can decay . in the case of an even number of daughter nucleons ,",
    "the available energy levels are filled up to a value @xmath16-q , and in the case of an odd number , there is a hole at the highest energy in the ground state .",
    "therefore , the weighting function is given by @xcite : @xmath17 the value of n@xmath18 , the number of daughter nucleons promoted to the highest energy due to the pairing forces , is : @xmath19 where dn@xmath20/d@xmath10 is the density of states of protons ( neutrons ) in @xmath21 decay and @xmath22 is the pairing gap",
    ".    the decay must be energetically possible , so the lowest possible energy that a decaying nucleon can have is @xmath16-q - e , recalling that e is the ( negative ) transition energy of the decaying nucleon .",
    "thus , @xmath23 in equation [ eq1 ] equals @xmath16-q - e , removing that variable from the equation .",
    "although a smooth model is adaptable to decays , particularly from the ground - state , excited states present the added difficulty of potentially altering the strength functions . for an accurate treatment ,",
    "an estimate of the quantum numbers of these states is made . in the initial calculation",
    ", discrete energy levels are used .",
    "thus , the density of states for neutrons ( protons ) in @xmath21 becomes : @xmath24 where the value of n@xmath25 corresponds to the number of nucleons in each state i. for discrete fermi states , the levels are two - particle levels with n = zero , one , or two .",
    "the weighting function w(e,@xmath10 ) in equation [ eq1 ] can also be adjusted for single particle daughter levels . in the original gross theory ,",
    "the weighting function takes on values between zero and one and is typically zero or one except at a few special points .",
    "if energy levels are discrete , then the value of the weighting function for a two particle level is either zero , one , or 0.5 for a level that is already filled , empty , or half - filled ( containing a single nucleon ) respectively . in this formulation ,",
    "the weighting function corresponding to the availability of the proton ( neutron ) level structure of the daughter nucleus , in @xmath21 depends on the energies of both the daughter nucleon levels @xmath26 and the parent nucleon levels @xmath27 , because their difference is necessary to determine if the decay is energetically possible : @xmath28 where the @xmath29 is for @xmath30-decay , m@xmath31 is the electron mass , and @xmath32 is the neutron - proton mass difference .",
    "each composite state is treated as a mixture of quantum states that will depend on the model used .",
    "therefore , the mixture in a level i is characterized by a sum of eigenstates weighted by the coefficient @xmath33(i;n,@xmath34,@xmath35 ) as a function of the quantum numbers of n , @xmath34 , @xmath35 . for this study , the quantum numbers are for eigenstates of a spherical shell model based on a woods - saxon potential .",
    "the coefficients for a level i are normalized to unity : @xmath36 for each level i. the description and calculation of weights , as well as the determination of single - particle states , are further discussed in ",
    "[ spcalc ] .",
    "transition strength functions are then adjusted to accomodate the single particle states in the daughter nucleus .",
    "discrete functions are used to specify the most probable location and quantum numbers of an available state .",
    "then , the transition strength for a specific level i can be written as a sum of the product of weights for the parent and daughter levels , since levels in the daughter nucleus are now assigned .",
    "the transition strength for favored decays now becomes : @xmath37 where the function @xmath38 is used to designate the selection rules ( for the set of quantum numbers @xmath39 and @xmath40 of the initial state i and final state f respectively ) which satisfy the transition type @xmath14 : @xmath41    the strength functions are also normalized to satisfy the necessary sum rules @xcite . for a single energy level ,",
    "the fermi and gt strength functions are normalized to unity : @xmath42 while the vector and axial first - forbidden functions are normalized as @xcite : @xmath43 where r is the nuclear radius . by substituting into equation [ eq1 ] ,",
    "the decay rate for @xmath30 decay is now : @xmath44 the variables @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath45 represent the quantum numbers associated with the states comprising the parent and daughter states respectively and the factor to satisfy the necessary selection rules , as mentioned above .",
    "the decay order is given by @xmath34 .",
    "the summation over @xmath14 is simply the sum over all possible transition orders in the decay .",
    "g@xmath13 is the appropriate coupling constant ( vector or axial - vector ) for the transition .",
    "the value of c is equal to 1 for allowed transitions and ( @xmath46/m@xmath31c)@xmath47 for first forbidden transitions , the only possibilities considered in this paper .",
    "the value e is the transition energy , and is simply the difference in parent and daughter energy states plus ( minus ) the neutron - proton mass difference and the electron mass in @xmath21 decay .    the transition matrix elements for a nucleus are then calculated as : @xmath48 the daughter level k is determined by the parent level i , the transition energy e , and the transition order @xmath14 .",
    "the sum over quantum states @xmath39 in the i@xmath49 parent level as well as the sum over states @xmath40 in the j@xmath49 daughter level are both necessary .",
    "though the daughter state is constrained by the transition selection rules for a transition @xmath14 , there may be several quantum states so allowed , so the sum over states @xmath40 is necessary . as an example , the discrete transition strength matrix elements for @xmath50sn are shown in figures [ gtstr ] - [ vecstr ] .",
    "one should note the characteristic broad peak corresponding to the gt matrix element ( as compared to the fermi matrix element , which has no viable transition strengths relevant for @xmath51 decay ) , as well as the double peak characteristic of the first - order transition elements .",
    "it can be seen from equation [ eq10 ] that excited states are completely accounted for in the values n@xmath25 and n@xmath52 .",
    "this makes the utility of the equation obvious .",
    "as well , nuclear excitations can take the form of proton or neutron single - particle excitations without regard to the type of decay .",
    "the inclusion of selection rules is accomplished through a specification of quantum numbers of individual states .",
    "furthermore , if all of the possible energy states above the fermi surface are specified , the population of these states are assumed to be in thermodynamic equilibrium , and the partition function is then determined . therefore , at temperatures peculiar to the r - process environment ( or any environment ) , the values n@xmath25 and n@xmath52 can be substituted with the probability functions for a statistical ensemble in thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "besides the calculation of single particle energies , the only remaining term in the rate equation is the f - function which , based on the order @xmath53 , rank @xmath54 , and vector nature of the transition ( axial vector or vector ) for @xmath30-decay is : @xmath55 where f@xmath56 is the fermi function , which is taken to be the same in all cases ; f@xmath56=f@xmath57 , independent of @xmath53 .",
    "the quantity s@xmath58 is the factor for the coulomb interaction between the outgoing electron wave function and the nucleon wave functions .",
    "w is defined as the electron kinetic energy e@xmath31/(m@xmath31c@xmath47)@xmath291 for @xmath30-decay , and w@xmath57 corresponds to the maximum possible electron energy e for a transition .",
    "also , the terms p and q are given by p=(w@xmath47 - 1)@xmath59 and q = w@xmath57-w .",
    "the forms of the wave function factors used are those of reference @xcite .        the finite range droplet model ( frdm ) with the lipkin - nogami ( ln ) pairing force is used to calculate single - particle levels for the various nuclei .",
    "the formula is referred to as a microscopic - macroscopic - or `` mic - mac '' model .",
    "the macroscopic part is a smooth function of proton number z and neutron number n based on a finite range liquid drop model .",
    "the microcopic part is used to calculate individual shell energies and is based on a folded - yukawa single - particle potential .",
    "the macroscopic part is described if reference @xcite .",

    "the parametrized macroscopic part , as described in the reference is : @xmath60 the parameters for this expression , as well as their derivations , are described extensively in @xcite , and will be described briefly here .",
    "many of the constants used in this relationship are described in table [ frdm_param ] .",
    "other derived quantities are given in the table , as well .",
    "the standard droplet model defines the shape - dependent quantities @xcite as the surface energy @xmath61 , the surface redistribution energy @xmath62 , the curvature energy @xmath63 , and the volume redistribution energy @xmath64 .",

    "the volume term is specified as @xmath68 and : @xmath69 the quantities @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the relative generalized surface and coulomb energies respectively for a deformed shape of volume @xmath72 .",

    "the macroscopic constants in the frdm have been determined based on a non - linear least squares fit requiring about 1000 iterations of the process of choosing parameters , recalculating potential surfaces , finding the fit , and re - adjusting parameters .",
    "the microscopic portion of the model involves the individual shell terms plus the effective interaction pairing gaps for protons and neutrons@xcite : @xmath76 in which a constant level density is assumined in the vicinity of the fermi energy level .",
    "the value of @xmath77 is determined by a least - squares fit .    finally , microscopic corrections to the frdm are carried out by decoupling the shell and pairing potentials as well as the proton and neutron potentials .",
    "the single - particle potential is then the sum of the central potential @xmath78 , which - as stated - is the folded yukawa potential , the spin - obit potential @xmath79 , and the coulomb central potential for protons @xmath80 .",
    "two - particle levels as a function of nucleon number are compared to those determined by the nilson model ( with no deformation ) for the @xmath50sn nucleus in figure [ shells ] showing a reasonable agreement between the two .    for a more complete description of the ln pairing interaction and microscopic interaction , the reader",
    "is referred to references @xcite and to @xcite and references therein .    in the present calculation ,",
    "single particle levels are determined for both the parent and daughter nucleons .",
    "that is , transitions between specific levels are calculated for a nucleus with j parent nucleons and k daughter nucleons to a nucleus with j-1 parent nucleons and k+1 daughter nucleons .",
    "thus , corrections to any shell and pairing energies are intrinsically accounted for .",
    "a knowledge of the quantum numbers of each level enables one to calculate the order of a particular @xmath0 transition .",
    "however , as stated previously , a fermi gas model level at a specific energy may correspond to several shell model levels in the present formulation , so it may turn out to be a mixture of single - particle shell model eigenstates .",
    "the basis of states is assumed to be those of a spherical shell model with a woods - saxon potential @xcite .",
    "the weight for each set of quantum numbers in a level is determined by the proximity of a level s energy to that of a basis state .",
    "the overlap of the eigenfunctions at a shell level determines the strength of their presence in the level ( figure [ eigen ] ) .",
    "the method of nakata et al . is used to determine not only the quantum numbers of parent nucleons , but also those of daughter nucleons @xcite .",

    "the function is already normalized to n@xmath83 , which is equal to the degeneracy of a level , 2j+1 .",
    "the width q(a ) of the basis function of the @xmath84 level in a nucleus with @xmath85 levels is given by : @xmath86 where d@xmath25 is the standard level spacing : @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the energy of the fermi surface of the @xmath84 level .",
    "since the values of @xmath10 are allowed to vary smoothly , and scale smoothly with level , fermi gas levels are appropriate to effect this scaling .",
    "the total sum of the functions in equation [ eq21 ] is also defined : @xmath89 and g(@xmath10 ) is automatically normalized to the total number of nucleons . to find the coefficient @xmath33(i;n , l , j ) in equation [ eq9 ] for the i@xmath49 single - particle level , it is necessary to normalize the function g(@xmath10 ) such that the overlap in the the region of the level is equal to two - the number of nucleons per level : @xmath90 where the integration limits are the midpoints between the i@xmath49 level and adjacent levels : @xmath91 for i=1 @xmath92=0 .",
    "the coefficient for a particular configuration of quantum numbers in the i@xmath49 level is then : @xmath93 this method is diagrammed in figure [ eigen ] @xcite .",
    "the degeneracy of the spherical shell model level @xmath82 is already accounted for in equation [ eq21 ] with the factor n@xmath83 .",
    "the selection rules in equation [ eq10 ] are then given by the function @xmath94 and can now be easily determined , where @xmath14 is the order and rank of the transition ( @xmath53,@xmath22j ) ; @xmath39 and @xmath40 represent the quantum numbers of the initial and final nucleon states respectively , ( n@xmath25,@xmath95,j@xmath25;n@xmath96,@xmath97,j@xmath96 ) .",
    "thus , the selection rules can be simply stated as : @xmath98 where the values of @xmath53 and @xmath99 depend on the initial and final state quantum numbers .    because each state s wave function is a sum of shell - model eigenstates , the smearing of single - state quantum numbers over several single - particle states is possible .",
    "the net result is still an average calculation of @xmath0-decay rates , but now individual particle and particle - hole excitations can be simulated by promoting an arbitrary nucleon to any available level .",
    "further , the selection rules are now easily calculated using the method of the previous section .",
    "if the highest - level paired neutron decays , the other neutron in that level gains an amount of energy roughly equal to the pairing energy of that level .",
    "as well , paired neutrons in the next lowest level are then expected to reconfigure by both losing an amount of energy equal to the pairing energy of that level . thus , the endpoint energy ( taken to be positive in this respect ) is changed by an amount equal to 2b@xmath100-b@xmath101 just from the changes in the parent nucleus .",
    "( it is not necessary to include the energy of the decaying neutron since this is accounted for in the quantity @xmath102 . )    similarly , in the daughter nucleus , if the highest proton level ( in @xmath103-decay ) is unpaired , and a neutron decays to that level , then the highest original paired level loses its pairing energy for the two protons , while the level to which the neutron decays becomes the highest paired level , increasing the total endpoint energy by an amount b@xmath101 , and the total energy available to the ejected electron changes by b@xmath101 - 2b@xmath100 .",
    "( again , the pairing energy of the decaying particle is not included for the same reasons mentioned above . )",
    "decay rates and q - values have been calculated with the frdm in previous works @xcite .",
    "the level of accuracy of these calculations is shown in figures [ frdm_rates ] and [ frdm_q ] for about 200 sample neutron - rich nuclei unstable against @xmath103decay for which the decay rates and q - values are experimentally known . in figure",
    "[ frdm_rates ] , the value of s is defined as : @xmath104 in each figure , most calculated rates fall within an order of magnitude of the true rate .",
    "a next logical step is to calculate decay rates for nuclei in excited states .",
    "the present formulation gives no preferential treatment to nucleons in single - particle excited states .",
    "one simply needs to know the values of the excited levels and the vacant levels for equations [ eq7 ] and [ eq8 ] .",
    "the levels are already calculated from  [ spcalc ] .",
    "levels can be calculated beyond the maximum filled level in the ground state , although the simplicity of the model can render these values slightly different from their experimental counterparts .    in stellar environments , the probability of finding a nucleus in an excited state at a given temperature can be obtained from the partition function by knowing the spin and energy of the excited state .",
    "since each particle level holds only two nucleons , the degeneracy of each level is two , and the quantum numbers are given by the level s proximity to those of the spherical shell model ( as described in   [ qnum ] ) .",
    "the difference in energy : @xmath105 where values with an @xmath106 are those for an excited - state nucleus , while those with a @xmath107 are those corresponding to a ground - state nucleus .",
    "the summation is taken over neutron and proton levels .",
    "the value m is the highest bound state level .",
    "the first term represents the total energy of the excited nucleus , and the second term is the total energy of the ground - state nucleus .",
    "the average decay rate of an isotope in a stellar environment is then the weighted sum over energy states @xcite : @xmath108 where p(@xmath22e ) is calculated using the partition function .",
    "excited states and their decay rates have been calculated for several nuclei . a sample of the decay rates as a function of these states",
    "are shown for four nuclei in figure [ beta_states ] .",
    "this figure shows the dependence of decay rates on excitation for an even - even nucleus ( @xmath109ba ) , an odd - n nucleus ( @xmath110ba ) , an odd - z nucleus ( @xmath111cs ) , and an odd - odd nucleus ( @xmath109la ) .",
    "one first notes the multiplicity of levels resulting from the splitting of states with spins higher than 1/2 , a direct result of using levels with a degeneracy of two .",
    "one also notes the apparent clustering of decay rates into bands . in the case of @xmath109ba ,",
    "one notes three major bands at @xmath1120.75 , 1 , and 2 where @xmath113 is the ground - state decay rate .",
    "this is due to the fact that single - particle levels are dominated by specific shell - model eigenstates in certain regions , as expected . in the case of @xmath109ba ,",
    "the first several single - particle neutron excitations above the ground - state contain large admixtures of the @xmath114 state , while those near the ground - state fermi surface are predominantly in the @xmath115 state . in the case of transitions in this region ,",
    "the decay order of the particle - hole configurations goes from gt to first - forbidden , thus reducing the decay rate .",
    "single - particle excitations in certain energy regions are expected to have similar decay strengths .",
    "the band at @xmath1122 is due to proton @xmath116 particle - hole configurations which do not change the transition order , but change the decay q - value by opening up a hole at lower energies .",
    "the band at @xmath1171 corresponds to @xmath118 configurations .",
    "since this has very little impact on the highest - energy gt ( or first - forbidden ) transitions ( to the @xmath119 or @xmath120 state ) , the overall transition rate is changed very little .",
    "it is expected that higher excitations will result in other band structures . however , since astrophysically interesting temperatures are below 1 mev , the contribution to average decay rates from states much above this is small , so only lower excitations were studied .",
    "similarly , the band structures in the other nuclei shown can be explained in a similar manner .",
    "the band structures of other nuclei vary based on their individual structures . for example , @xmath121 has a band at @xmath122 , but no band at @xmath123 ( for the energies of interest ) .",
    "this nucleus has a higher deformation than @xmath109ba , as well as an unpaired neutron and an unpaired proton .",
    "the lowest excitation energies are accomplished via neutron @xmath124 particle - hole configurations , but single - proton excitations are due primarily to the unpaired proton , which has little bearing on the available hole , but does account slightly for the vertical band structure in the figure ; the rate increases with the transition energy for a single type of transition .",
    "of course , excitations can change the strength functions , as the order of a particular transition can be altered . in the case of @xmath109ba , the gt strength function",
    "is shown for the ground state , a transition to the region dominated by the @xmath116 state , and an excited state dominated by the @xmath124 state in figure [ exc_func ] .",
    "as expected , the neutron excitation lowers the overall gt transition strength , particularly at the highest transition energies , where the transition rate is highest .",
    "conversely , the proton excitation increases the overall rate slightly at the lowest energies , while also increasing the q - value .",
    "it should be noted in this case that , although the rate is doubled and the gt strength function for the proton excitation looks very similar to that of the ground - state , the average lifetime is still relatively low ( @xmath2300ms ) , and the result is a small absolute increase in lifetime ( to about 315ms ) .",

    "nuclei closer to stability , on the other hand , have truncated gt strength functions .",

    "relative changes in decay rates along the r - process path are shown in figure [ rel_rates ] for the line of constant neutron separation energy @xmath125 mev for three different temperatures .",

    "the newtonian forms of these heating and cooling rates are described in detail in references @xcite and @xcite .",

    "this becomes important especially along the r - process path where neutron separation energies are low .",
    "one may expect an increase in both the neutron emission rate as well as the capture rate for excited - state nuclei though capture and photoemission are in equilibrium in the classical r - process . however , single - neutron excitations can not go above the neutron separation energy . for this reason ,",
    "single - neutron excitations are kept realistically low ( though multiple - particle excitations may be higher ) . indeed , even at r - process temperatures",
    ", one does not expect a significant population of states above the neutron separation energy .",
    "while the network calculation proceeds to z=100 , the mass formula used in this work has shell energies up to n=157 .",
    "therefore , neutron - rich nuclei with n@xmath157157 can not be quantified , which effectively limits proton number z to about 93 .",
    "however , this is well past the a=195 peak in the r - process abundance distribution , and the effects of not including excited state rates for these very heavy nuclei have little effect on the abundances of the lighter nuclei .",
    "also , it was found that the abundances of fissile nuclei along the path are very low at freezeout , so that the inclusion of fission cycling was ignored in this r - process model",
    ".      the inclusion of excited state @xmath0-decays into the reaction network can be computationally simple .",
    "functional forms of decay rates with temperature were used .",
    "this allows a fairly accurate evaluation of the calculated rates of individual nuclei for temperatures between 0 and 6 billion k , while still maintaining the speed of the network calculation .",
    "sixteen regions of the isotopic chart were found for which decay rates of nuclei in these regions have similar dependences on temperature .",
    "these regions are shown in table [ temp_fits ] .",
    "nuclei represented in these figures have neutron separation energies s@xmath4 ranging between 0 and about 2.75 mev .",
    "this sort of parametrization allows for a very reasonable first approximation of the change in decay rates over a large region of the isotopic chart .",
    "the dependence on temperature for the above mentioned regions can be conveyed with a set of parameters fit to the formula : @xmath158 + { \\alpha}\\exp{\\left({\\beta{t_9}+\\gamma{t_9 ^ 2}}\\right)}\\ ] ] where @xmath159 is the @xmath0-decay rate at temperature t@xmath155 ( defined to be the temperature in 10@xmath5 kelvin ) , and the ground - state decay rate is @xmath113 .",
    "the ratio in equation [ eq1 - 5 ] must be unity at t@xmath155=0 , so several of the parameters are dependent : @xmath160 so the parameter set is reduced to eight in number .",
    "further , in using equation [ eq1 - 5 ] to fit the dependences of rates to temperature , two terms were necessary in the temperature region of interest .",
    "in actuality , only one of the two terms is present at a time .",
    "so if @xmath11 is non - zero , then @xmath154 is zero and vice - versa . also",
    ", @xmath154 is limited to one of two values - 0 or 1 - leaving seven free parameters .",
    "the parameters for each of the regions mentioned above , along with the nuclei included in each region , are given in table [ temp_fits ] .",
    "two of the parameters in table [ temp_fits ] are functions of the nuclear proton number z. these are the values of a for region 8 and the value of @xmath6 for region 7a , listed in the table as @xmath161 and @xmath162 respectively .",
    "this is a convenient way of representing these parameters over a very large isotopic region , as the functional form of the temperature dependence of decay rate changes slowly with z. these parameters are given by : @xmath163 no odd - even effects are observed because equation [ eq1 - 5 ] is a ratio of rates , so any local odd - even effects would be minimized in the division .",
    "variations in the parameters as a function of mass seem to be explainable in terms of local shell effects .",
    "it is worth mentioning the use and applicability of the spherical shell model in this formulation .",
    "one should not only consider effects on decay rates , but on the overall r - process .",
    "while it is difficult to compare to a more elaborate model in this work without utilizing such a model , a qualitative assesment is discussed here .",
    "two things which are not necessarily mutually exclusive must be considered .",
    "the first is the accuracy of the decay rates used .",
    "the second is the applicability of the spherical shell model to the nuclei studied .",
    "in particular , one can estimate effects on individual transitions when one considers a nilsson shell model with deformation .",
    "for this reason , nuclei which are presumed undeformed are compared to those which are considered to lie in regions of deformity in the isotopic chart ( i.e. , between closed shells ) are discussed .    in estimating the accuracy of the calculated decay rates , one considers uncertainties in calculations for ground - state nuclei ; the uncertainty in the decay rates may be estimated using figure [ frdm_rates ] .",
    "the rms error in s ( equation [ eq1 - 4 ] ) for all nuclei studied in this work with known @xmath103 decay rates has been calculated .",
    "the rms value s@xmath164=@xmath165s@xmath166 has for all nuclei , even - even nuclei , odd - n nuclei , odd - z nuclei , and odd - odd nuclei to be 0.767 , 0.569 , 0.805 , 0.745 , and 0.872 respectively for the ground state nuclei , indicating reasonable agreement as shown in figure [ frdm_rates ] for at least the nuclei with known decay rates including those in regions of presumed deformity .",
    "the accuracy improves with rate as the presumed level density increases . for nuclei with @xmath1670.1",
    "s@xmath151 the value of s@xmath164 is 0.579 and decreases further to 0.467 for nuclei with @xmath167 1 s@xmath151 , indicating the improvement in the accuracy of this formulation for the r - process , in which the decay rates are larger .",
    "the agreement is also equally good for the few known neutron - rich isomers , though some caution is warranted here as the number of known isomeric states is small .",
    "as many of the nuclei studied were extremely neutron rich , the uncertainty in calculations is expected to be reasonable for those nuclei along the r - process path .",
    "in fact , the uncertainty is expected to decrease with single - particle level density . while reasonable , these errors may likely be reduced with a more realistic model .    in the case of non - deformed nuclei ,",
    "the spherical shell model is believed to be a reasonable estimate of the decay rates .",
    "this is extremely important in the case of the r - process as the waiting points are localized about areas of lowest deformation ; most of the r - process abundance is confined to these regions of the isotopic chart .",
    "large uncertainties in the decay rates through the waiting points can result in drastic changes in the final distribution .",
    "for example , consider the a@xmath2130 abundance peak .",
    "if the decays rates of the r - process nuclei associated with this peak were much higher , then an increased flow through this peak would result , resulting in a much lower abundance of nuclei in this peak and a very large enhancement of the rare earth nuclei ( 130@xmath126a@xmath126190 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the portion of the r - process path thought to be responsible for the production of the rare - earth elements passes through a region of the isotopic chart associated with possibly large deformations .",
    "the overall effects on the final r - process abundance distribution due to changes in the decay rates of these nuclei is expected to be small as their contribution to the total abundance is small . in the case of these possibly deformed nuclei , single - particle levels in the nilsson model",
    "may shift by as much as 0.5 mev from those of the spherical shell model in cases of extreme deformation .",
    "however , single - particle levels are shifted in both the positive direction and the negative direction for protons and neutrons .",
    "qualitatively , the net effect is to break degeneracies in closed shells while `` spreading out '' high localized single - particle level densities associated with closed shells .",
    "consider , for example , figures [ exc_func ] and [ exc_func_ff ] which show the calculated gt and first - forbidden strength functions for the @xmath109ba nucleus for various excitations .",
    "if a more realistic structure model was used , the net result would be a spreading of the widths of the peaks of these functions as both the daughter and parent states would undergo shifts in both the positive and negative energies . while some of the strength function would shift to higher transition energies ( more negative energies on the figure ) resulting in contributions to higher decay rates , some would also shift to positive energies resulting in contributions to lower decay rates ( and possibly - though unlikely - to states that can not decay ) . by shifting the transition energy by an extreme amount of 0.5 mev for a gt transition in equation [ eq10 ]",
    ", it is estimated that the transition rates may change by as much as a factor of two .",
    "however , it must be carefully noted that this is for a shift of the entire gt transition strength in one direction for an extreme amount for only the most deformed nuclei .",
    "thus , this factor is an upper limit for very deformed nuclei , and likely the error due to using a more accurate model is found using the rms values in s as discussed above .",
    "certainly future work may concentrate on more realistic model calculations , though it will be seen from the next section that this may not be necessary as the results of the r - process calculations are more heavily dependent on uncertainties in the hydrodynamic conditions .",
    "the results from several hydrodynamic parameter sets , as well as electron fraction parameter values @xmath168 , were examined .",
    "these parameter sets are shown in table [ net_parms ] .",
    "for each parameter set , the core mass in solar masses , core radius , neutrino luminosity , initial electron fraction , and whether or not @xmath0-delayed neutron emission is included are listed . using these parameters and the calculations of reference @xcite the dynamic timescale and the entropy in the expansion are constrained .",
    "though still in agreement with current predictions , the dynamic timescales in these calculations are shorter than average . however , the entropy is lower , and no artificial increase in the entropy ( as is often assumed ) was required @xcite .",
    "each simulation is run until several seconds beyond freezeout . while this time is sufficient to gauge the gross features of the r - process abundance distribution",
    ", a longer simulation may have resulted in more post - processing , allowing for smoother abundance distributions .",
    "figure [ hyd_res ] shows that model a underproduces the a@xmath2195 peak by a large amount .",
    "this is due primarily to the fact that the lower entropy in model a results in a very low neutron - to - seed ratio .",
    "models b and c were chosen as intermediate points in the entropy - timescale phase space .",
    "both produce a more acceptable r - process abundance distribution , although the a@xmath2195 peak is still underproduced . for comparison",
    ", the solar r - process abundance distribution is displayed in the figure .",
    "one notes some residual even - odd effects in the calculated distribution as the effects of smoothing may not be complete , though the gross features of the distribution are noted .",
    "results from models b and c are displayed in figure [ q_comp ] for both the hot ( i.e. , including excited - state decays , solid line ) and cold ( i.e. , not including excited state decays , dashed line ) models .",
    "the a@xmath2195 peak is most profoundly affected , along with the nuclei just below this mass region . from the relationship between the decay rates and temperature ( equation [ eq1 - 5 ] and table [ temp_fits ] )",
    ", it can be seen that decay rates of the nuclei in the region just below the a@xmath2195 peak ( and - to a lesser extent - the region just below the a@xmath2130 peak ) are quite sensitive to changes in temperature even at low temperatures .",
    "this is expected due to the high level densities of these nuclei ( lying just below the n=126 and n=82 closed shells ) , as discussed in  [ grosstheory ] .",
    "shell quenching has not been included in this calculation , though the effect is noted , and no conclusions can be drawn from this study to evaluate the effects of quenced closed shells far from stability .",
    "other rates , however , are not as sensitive to temperature changes at low temperatures and , as the r - process progresses , these rates would drop to their ground - state values before those of the nuclei in the regions below the abundance peaks . the decay rates of nuclei in this region",
    "would increase relative to those of nuclei in other regions of the path , selectively depleting the abundances of nuclei in this region .",
    "this effect is displayed in figure [ rel_rates ] , in which nuclei in these two regions have large changes in decay rate as t@xmath155 increases a small amount .",
    "the lowering of the electron fraction in models f and g is a physically acceptable assumption given that the electron neutrinos and anti - neutrinos captured on nucleons before the beginning of the @xmath154-process can alter the neutron excess @xmath169 via neutrino interactions on the free nucleons in nse . in a steady - state , the electron fraction is @xcite : @xmath170 given the neutrino energies assumed in the nucleosynthesis code , then a value as low as @xmath168=0.35 may not be unexpected , though higher values have also been used .",
    "the abundance distribution results of models f and g are shown in figure [ q_comp2 ] .",
    "the a@xmath2195 peaks are more pronounced - closer to acceptable values - in both cases as compared to models b and c. even more , abundances of nuclei with heavier masses are also increased , more closely matching the solar system abundance distribution in this region . as in previous models ,",
    "the effect of excited state @xmath0-decays is still quite evident in both models , especially for the heavy nuclei with a@xmath157195 .",
    "the ratios of peak abundances for these models are shown in table [ relabs ] . both models",
    "have peak abundance ratios close to that of the solar system . also , in both models , the a@xmath2195 peak is shifted closer in position to the solar system abundance peak .",
    "the slight decrease in y@xmath31 , while still maintaining physically realistic values , combined with the use of excited - state @xmath0-decays , produces an r - process calculation with results that match the solar system distribution , with the exception of nuclei in the a@xmath2180 region , which seem to exhibit a deficiency in abundance .",
    "figures [ q_comp ] and [ q_comp2 ] suggest that the inclusion of excited - state @xmath0-decays results in a net shift of abundance from the region of nuclei just below the a@xmath2195 abundance peak into this abundance peak .",
    "certainly , one notes that the more rapid decay rates in the region just below the abundance peaks results in a faster progression of the r - process through these nuclei .",
    "however , one should also note that the integrated abundances for nuclei with 180@xmath126a@xmath126200 is higher in the hot model by than in the cold model by 29% , indicating that overall abundance is increased in both the abundance peak and the region below this peak .",
    "this suggests that the increase in abundance in the a@xmath2195 abundance peak is only partially due to an increase in the decay rates of the nuclei associated with the region just below this peak .",
    "one must note that the overall abundance in the 180@xmath126a@xmath126200 region increases due to a flow of abundance into this region from the lower masses .",
    "this increased abundance can come from minute changes in abundance in the a@xmath2130 peak and from the mass region just below this peak . in the semi - log representation of figures [ q_comp ] and [ q_comp2 ]",
    ", it is seen that even small fractional changes in the abundance of the a@xmath2130 peak - with nearly an order of magnitude more abundance than the a@xmath2195 peak - can result in sizable changes in the 180@xmath126a@xmath126200 mass region .",
    "a similar comparison can be made between the abundance region just below the a@xmath2130 peak and the a@xmath2195 peak .",
    "this brings up an interesting point regarding the net effect of rate increases with temperature in the r - process .",
    "not surprisingly , figure [ rel_rates ] shows that decay rates for the closed - shell nuclei are only affected at high temperatures ( corresponding to early stages in the r - process ) . very early in the r - process ,",
    "flow through the a@xmath2130 mass region increases relative to the remaining nulcei along the r - process path , populating the rare earth region .",
    "however , as temperature drops before freezeout , the relative flow through this mass region decreases , and the relative flow through the rare earth region is still higher , populating nuclei in the a@xmath2195 mass region . as the a@xmath2195 mass region is not populated until later ( and cooler ) in the r - process , the effects of excited - state decays are minimal .",
    "the net result is that as the r - process progresses to higher mass , the relative decay rates drop on average first for the a@xmath2130 abundance peak and then for the rare earth region .",
    "abundances of the r - process progenitor nuclei are affected early on by increased rates of the a@xmath2130 nuclei and later on by those of the rare earth nuclei .",
    "of course , the net effect is dependent on the passage of the r - process path through many nuclei , so the network calculation is employed as a useful tool .",
    "models d and e are identical to models c and b respectively , except for the fact that @xmath0-delayed neutron emission reactions are included in models d and e. the final freezeout abundance for model d is compared to that of model c , and the final freezeout abundance of model e is compared to that of b in figure [ mod_s_comp ] .",
    "the distribution seems to be shifted slightly to heavier mass when @xmath0-delayed neutron emission is included . while this may be surprising , just after freezeout , as nuclei begin to @xmath0-decay back to stability , @xmath0-delayed neutrons become available for capture by all nuclei . the two - neutron emission probability as shown in figure [ emissions ] is higher in the 125@xmath126a@xmath126180 region than in the region surrounding the a@xmath2195 peak , while the single - neutron emission probability is slightly higher in the a@xmath2195 region , resulting in a larger net loss of neutrons in the lower mass nuclei . furthermore",
    ", the heavier nuclei tend to have higher neutron capture cross - sections @xcite .",
    "the overall result is that the masses of the heavy nuclei are increased by a few mass units .",
    "figure [ mod_s_comp ] shows that the mass shift of the abundance peak is roughly two mass units , indicating that nuclei in the a@xmath2195 mass region have captured at least two net neutrons while decaying back to stability .",
    "this necessitates further study regarding the dynamical nature of the r - process after freezeout @xcite ; the r - process path continues to evolve to its final distribution even after the neutron abundance has dropped several orders of magnitude .",
    "this work provides a study of the effects of excited state @xmath0-decays on the r - process .",
    "a preliminary method was used to evaluate the possible effects of @xmath0-decay rates of excited - state nuclei .",
    "though the accuracy of the model is limited by the knowledge of single particle levels , an approximate treatment allows one to gauge the magnitude of effects on the r - process and provide impetus for further study .",
    "an empirical calculation was employed to find single - particle levels , and quantum numbers were deduced based on the level proximity to those of the spherical shell model . although minor effects were found to result from inclusion of the excited state decays , there are also other possible effects that the inclusion of excited state nuclei may have on the r - process .",
    "one can imagine that if the excitation is due to the promotion of neutrons to higher - lying single - particle orbitals , then the photoneutron q - value will decrease , and the ( @xmath6,n ) reaction rate may increase . thus the effect of an increased rate might be to shift the r - process path closer to @xmath0-stability .",
    "all models used in this calculation do a reasonable qualitative job of reproducing the solar abundance distribution for the mass region @xmath171 .",
    "the fact that the abundance at low mass is roughly independent of the type of model used ( hot or cold ) is an indicator that the nuclei in this region have decay rates not as heavily dependent on temperature as some of the higher mass nuclei . in the more massive nuclei ,",
    "the sensitivity of the decay rates on temperature resulted in a more pronounced shift in the path as the r - process evolves through freezeout .",
    "as mentioned previously , the dynamical treatment of the r - process is an important factor here in that the path continues to evolve even during freezeout , a result of @xmath0-delayed neutron emission . with the mass formula used in this evaluation",
    ", it was found that the low mass nuclei have a higher probability of emitting two neutrons during @xmath0-decay than the higher mass nuclei , which have a higher probability of emitting a single neutron during @xmath0-decay .",
    "these available neutrons are recaptured , with the cross section roughly increasing with mass .",
    "the net result is a slight shift in the a@xmath2195 abundance peak .    despite the ability to predict a more reasonable abundance of the a@xmath2190 nuclei",
    ", there is still a discrepancy between the predicted abundance distribution in the rare earth region and that of the solar system .",
    "the abundances of the rare earth elements ( a@xmath2165 ) are predicted to be lower in abundance by about an order of magnitude than the a@xmath2130 peak , in fair agreement with that of the solar system .",
    "this corresponds to the argument of the authors of reference @xcite , who state that the rare - earth region is a robust feature of any dynamical calculation including post - production of the r - process progenitors .",
    "however , nuclei with 130@xmath126a@xmath126160 are overproduced slightly , removing the effect of the rare earth region being manifest as a peak , hence the appearance of the abundance distributions in the figure .",
    "it is obvious that no shell quenching has been employed in this preliminary model , as can be seen by the dip in the a@xmath2180 abundance .",
    "while the abundance of the a@xmath2180 nuclei relative to the a@xmath2130 peak is similar to that of the solar system , the width of this dip is greater than that of the solar system abundance distribution .",
    "it has been mentioned @xcite that the underproduction of nuclei in this region might vanish if the quenching of shell closures for the very neutron - rich nuclei in this mass region is properly included .",
    "because of the large number of nuclei involved , the improved semi - gross theory has been used to globally calculate decay rates .",
    "it is understood that the initial model represents a first attempt to gauge the effects of nuclear @xmath0-decays in the hot environment of the r - process , and further study is warranted . in particular , a more accurate global calculation of decay rates is desired .",
    "currently , the measurements of @xmath0-decay rates are limited to either ground - state nuclei or long - lived isomers . however , with the advent of large neutron flux devices@xcite , the measurement of the gt strength functions of nuclei in excited states from may become feasible within the next decade , allowing for experimental confirmation of the transition strengths of excited - state nuclei .",
