    "recently several designs for silicon - based quantum computer architectures have been proposed.@xcite in this work we concentrate our efforts on the kane model,@xcite which exploits a qubit array of nuclear spins of @xmath0p dopants embedded within a silicon crystal matrix .",
    "the model is based on the use of @xmath0p nuclear spins as qubits , with the donor electrons functioning to mediate control of single qubit operations via the hyperfine interaction , and interaction between individual qubits via the exchange interaction , and permit read - out of nuclear spin states .",
    "performing logical operations on either electron - spin or nuclear - spin solid - state qubits requires precise control over single and two - qubit unitary operations , which corresponds to precise control over the electron - electron exchange interaction and the electron - nucleus hyperfine interaction in the kane quantum computer .",
    "here we calculate the exchange interaction as a function of the two donors relative positions in the lattice and strain .",
    "we use multi - valley effective mass theory to calculate the single donor electron wave functions , these single donor orbitals combine to form our two - electron basis .",
    "this theory incorporates the si crystal lattice effects by including the si crystal bloch functions into our single donor electron basis . instead of using the heitler - london ( h - l ) approximation ,",
    "which has been used extensively in the literature so far for impurities in si,@xcite we describe our two - donor system using a rigorous molecular orbital method which employs our multi - valley single donor orbitals to form our two - electron basis , to calculate the exchange coupling more accurately .",
    "an important feature necessary for quantum computing is to have well - characterized qubits , and for the two qubit case this is the ground state singlet and triplet two - electron states .",
    "it is meaningful to study the degree of proximity these targeted ground state orbitals are to the rest of the unwanted excited state hilbert space.@xcite this energy separation gives us an estimate for the conditions under which adiabaticity can be attained .",
    "we have pursued this goal using a molecular orbital method , which enables us to calculate a large number of two - electron energy levels ( 144 ) , in the energy spectrum for our two donor system .",
    "we used a molecular orbital method which includes the single donor ground state and first five excited states at each donor to form the two - electron basis .",
    "this yields a basis of 78 singlet states and 66 triplet states .",
    "this method not only gives us the exchange coupling , which is the difference between the ground singlet and triplet two - electron states , but also the spectrum of energy levels for the two donor system .",
    "for comparison we also calculated the h - l exchange coupling using just the symmetrized and anti - symmetrized products of the single donor ground states , and the hund - mulliken ( h - m ) exchange coupling which in addition to the h - l states , includes the two doubly occupied single donor ground states at each donor , in our two - electron basis .",
    "we calculated the exchange coupling and energy spectrum for our two - electron system as a function of donor position and strain .",
    "in addition , we also calculated the probability that both electrons will be on the same donor .",
    "this is also an important parameter for quantum gate operations , as these doubly occupied states can become a potential source of error .",
    "several authors have similarly studied the exchange coupling , double - occupancy errors and adiabaticity of spin qubits in a number of different solid - state quantum computing architectures.@xcite    much attention has been devoted to modeling the hyperfine and exchange interactions in these devices.@xcite inter valley interference between degenerate conduction band minima in si has been shown to lead to oscillations in the exchange coupling as a function of the donor pair positioning in the lattice.@xcite this poses serious problems for the fabrication of these devices , and leads to an extreme sensitivity of the exchange energy on the relative orientation of the p atoms .",
    "koiller _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite demonstrated that the introduction of external strain on the si lattice partially lifts the valley degeneracy in the bulk si .",
    "they showed that the inter valley effects could be reduced in some cases depending on the relative orientations of the donor pairs , whilst in other cases the donor exchange coupling remains oscillatory .",
    "the molecular orbital method we employ not only improves the calculation of the two donor electron wave functions , but we also use a more flexible basis than previous studies@xcite to calculate the single donor electron wave functions , which are used to construct the two - electron basis .",
    "we advance beyond the simple h - l model for the two - electron wave function in the kane device that has been previously considered.@xcite in the molecular orbital method we use the single donor wave functions to form our basis states , and solve the 6-d schr@xmath1dinger equation for the two electrons through a direct matrix diagonalisation.@xcite    in the simplest case , the h - l approximation , the donor pair wave function is modeled as the symmetrized and anti - symmetrized products of the two single donor ground state wave functions ( `` @xmath2 '' states ) at each p nucleus , to form our singlet and triplet states respectively . in the h - m approximation , in addition to the two h - l states , the h - m basis incorporates the two `` ionised '' or `` polarised '' doubly occupied ground states , at each donor .    for the molecular orbital calculation we extended these bases to also include the first five excited states for each donor in our basis , in addition to the single donor ground states .",
    "this was chosen so that our basis included the six symmetry ground states for the single p donor , ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 states ) .",
    "we performed calculations for the exchange coupling to see the effect that this larger basis has on lowering the energy of both the singlet and triplet ground states , and to improve upon and test the validity of using h - l theory to model the two - donor system over a range of device parameters .",
    "we get a basis for our two - electron system which consists of the spatially symmetric singlet states , and anti - symmetric triplet states . because the spin part of the singlet and triplet states are orthogonal",
    ", we can consider the singlet and triplet bases independently .",
    "using six single donor orbitals on both qubits , we can form 78 singlet states and 66 triplet states .",
    "the molecular orbital method has advantages over some quantum chemical methods as it includes the correlation between the two electrons , by virtue of including many two - electron orbitals to minimise the energy of the system .",

    "in contrast , table [ tableref1a ] shows that for @xmath89 that all the higher excited states involve significant contributions from the @xmath126 basis states .",

    "as we noted earlier this is because the @xmath134 state has a smaller effective bohr radius along the inter donor axis .",
    "the two - electron donor pair is more stable when the electron wave functions are more centered toward each other along the inter donor axis .",
    "for example , at the energies corresponding to the states containing the @xmath4 one - electron symmetry states , the two - electron wave - functions are very mixed and we are no longer able to assign the energy levels to pure basis states",

    "this study shows that these doubly occupied states are important basis functions to include .",
    "we have improved upon a previous study@xcite where only h - l type orbitals were considered . because we use an extended basis which includes both doubly occupied and h - l type two - electron orbitals , we find that the two - electron wave functions are often mixed states .",

    "[ fig : fign2 ] to [ fig : fign4 ] are not scaled so that the conduction band bottom is at zero - energy .",
    "we evaluated relative energy shifts using the valley strain parameter , @xmath76 , for the single - donor strain hamiltonian matrix and neglected any shift proportional to identity in it , to be consistent with the calculations of koiller et al.@xcite therefore , the calculated energies do not refer to the zero - energy to be at the bottom of the conduction band . but the energy eigenvalues shown in table [ tableref1a ] and fig .",

    "we also plot the strain dependence of the double occupancy probability in ( b).,title=\"fig:\",width=192 ]    in figure [ fig : figh1](a ) we show the h - m calculation for the exchange energy for a range of inter donor separations along the @xmath137 $ ] direction to compare with the previous section .",
    "this plot demonstrates the oscillations in the exchange energy due to the inter valley interference between the degenerate conduction band minima .",
    "this oscillatory nature of the exchange coupling has already been reported by wellard _ _ et al.__@xcite and koiller _ _ et al.__@xcite using a h - l calculation .",
    "we have improved upon and checked the h - l approximation , by extending our basis to include the h - m states , and found that the h - m basis offers some improvement for the close inter donor separations , and also allows us to calculate the ground state double occupancy probability of both electrons on the same donor .",
    "we observe that for the zero strain case the oscillations in the exchange are the most conspicuous , as the inter valley interference is highest , because there are equal contributions from all six valleys in the ground singlet and triplet states .",
    "however , when a strain is applied in the @xmath7-direction , we find that the @xmath128 valleys are favored energetically ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : s2 ] ) , which implies a larger effective bohr radius along the inter donor axis ( @xmath8 ) , and hence the exchange coupling is improved substantially for this particular orientation of the p donor atoms along the @xmath137 $ ] axis.@xcite    in addition to calculating the variation of the exchange coupling with inter donor separation in fig .",
    "[ fig : figh1 ] , we also calculated the probability of the ground state double occupation of the h - m singlet states ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) in ( b).@xcite the exchange coupling with only the h - m states , matches the exchange coupling with the full spectrum of states very accurately .",
    "thus , based on this we expect that the most appreciable contribution of the doubly occupied states will be from the h - m doubly occupied singlet states in our basis , which is why we only report the double occupancy probability of these states .",
    "this double occupation probability is also an important parameter for quantum gate operations using electron spins as qubits . for non - zero exchange coupling the spin degrees of freedom",
    "are also correlated with the orbital motion , and there is some probability that both electrons will be on the same donor.@xcite these doubly occupied states are not part of the targeted computational space , and as such , are a potential source of leakage error in solid - state quantum computers .",
    "these plots show that as the strain parameter decreases , ( and the effective bohr radii in the @xmath97 and @xmath8-directions increases ) , this double occupancy probability increases as one may expect .",
    "schliemann _ _ et al.__@xcite showed that gate operations on coupled quantum dot pairs which temporarily increase the exchange splitting , in order to swap electronic spins , inevitably lead to a finite double occupancy probability for both dots .",
    "however they showed that this double occupancy amplitude does not lead to significant errors in quantum computing , provided that after the gate action is completed , the double occupancy probability is vanishingly small .",
    "but if the double occupancy probability occurs to any sizable extent before or as a result of the gating action , then any quantum computer based on this hardware is likely to fail .",
    "thus for the fabrication of these devices we want to minimise the double occupation probability for all states at zero voltage .    the exchange coupling increases consequently with a uniaxial strain applied in a direction perpendicular to the inter donor axis , which achieves faster gating times .",
    "however , the double occupancy probability also increases correspondingly , which increases the error requirement subsequently . in the last section we saw that both these features also lead to a greater mixing of the ground state with the higher excited states , which causes the energy levels to become closer together .",
    "this energy splitting between the targeted h - l orbitals and the rest of the excited two - electron states informs us if during the gating action , the coupled donor system is well isolated and the higher excited states can be safely neglected .",
    "this can also give us an estimate for gating times , so that the gating operation remains adiabatic .",

    "[ fig : figh3](a ) we can identify where the peaks and troughs occur for @xmath152 . in calculating the two - electron hamiltonian matrix and overlap matrix elements",
    ", we find that several of the integrals involving @xmath153 in the integrand , have a common factor of @xmath154 , in the sum over @xmath38 and @xmath155 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : figh3](a ) , we are varying @xmath147 in the @xmath87-plane , and consider @xmath156 , where @xmath157 and @xmath158 , and @xmath159 .",
    "we recognise that for the range of @xmath139 we consider , @xmath149 does not vary as much as @xmath148 , and @xmath148 ranges over both positive and negative values .",
    "thus we found that @xmath148 is the most significant factor in determining the peaks and troughs for this plot .    in the simplest case",
    "when @xmath160 and @xmath161 , and @xmath162 , there is a peak in the exchange coupling .",
    "we find that this is due to the fact that the real part of @xmath163 is the maximum value of 1 , for 18 out of the 36 possible combinations of @xmath38 and @xmath155 .",
    "similarly we observe peaks in the exchange coupling when @xmath164 , where m is any integer , and @xmath41 .",

    "again we find that the real part of @xmath163 is 1 for 18 out of the 36 possible combinations of @xmath38 and @xmath155 .",
    "it is difficult to determine the magnitude of the peaks in the exchange coupling , because this magnitude also depends on terms involving @xmath167 which is a complicated function of @xmath149 and @xmath139 .",
    "however in general we observe local maxima at values of @xmath139 for which @xmath168 , where m is any integer .    conversely we find troughs in the exchange coupling occurring at values of @xmath139 for which @xmath169 , where m is an odd integer . here",
    "we find that the real part of @xmath154 is 1 for 10 out of the 36 possible combinations of @xmath38 and @xmath155 , and @xmath170 for 8 of the remaining combinations .",
    "thus at these values of @xmath139 we observe local minima in the exchange coupling .",
    "because we are only able to evaluate the exchange coupling at finite grid points , the peaks and troughs were best matched to the data points available , thus enabling us to identify these trends .",
    "for @xmath79 in fig .",
    "[ fig : figh3](a ) we find that the exchange coupling is relatively constant .",
    "this is because for @xmath79 the dominant contributions in the ground state come from the two @xmath171 valleys , and only very small contributions from the other four valleys .",
    "thus when @xmath172 , the real part of @xmath173 is 1 for all the combinations of @xmath171 , and since the ground state has its largest components only in the @xmath171 valleys , the exchange coupling is maximised and almost constant , for this orientation .",
    "the small fluctuations in the exchange coupling are most likely due to the fact there may be small contributions from the other four conduction band minima , which oscillate as a function of @xmath139 as we saw earlier . in ( b ) and ( c ) of this figure",
    "we observe that when @xmath147 contains non - zero @xmath150 part , the exchange coupling may oscillate even more wildly for @xmath79 , as a result of the inter valley interference from only the two conduction band minima , @xmath171 .",
    "it is imperative to know precisely , the single electron wave function and two - electron states to determine accurately the parameter regime necessary for a nuclear spin or electron spin quantum computer . in this paper",
    "we provide detailed electronic structure calculations using a molecular orbital method , for a pair of p donor electrons in relaxed and uniaxially strained si .",
    "we have determined the excitation spectrum of two electrons on p donors in relaxed and strained si , and studied its dependence on donor positioning in the si lattice .",
    "in particular , we concentrated on the targeted ground state singlet and triplet `` h - l '' orbitals , and examined the isolation of these ground states , from the rest of the excited hilbert space .",
    "furthermore we calculated the exchange coupling and double occupancy probability as a function of strain and donor position .",
    "both the exchange splitting and double occupancy probability have a similar dependence on inter donor distance and lattice positioning of the p atoms .",
    "thus , a compromise is needed to maintain a very small double occupancy probability in zero field , while realizing a sizable exchange coupling during a gating action .",
    "in unison with previous theoretical studies of the exchange coupling of p donors in relaxed and strained si,@xcite we found that the exchange coupling , ( and thus double occupancy probability ) , is extremely sensitive to the relative orientation of the two p donors in the si lattice .",
    "however , the energy level spectrum appears not to be affected by the relative orientation of the p donors , as these energies are on a much larger scale than the exchange coupling .",
    "the oscillations in the exchange coupling due to inter valley interference , have serious implications for any quantum computer architecture that relies on the exchange interaction to couple qubits .",
    "this sensitivity can be reduced in the presence of strain , for displacements of the donors within the plane perpendicular to the direction of the uniaxial strain .",
    "we have also identified the values of @xmath147 that lead to the peaks and troughs in the exchange coupling .",
    "it would be useful to investigate the effect of an applied voltage on these oscillations , to examine the exchange coupling during and after a gate operation , to determine what device parameters are required for fault - tolerant quantum computation .",
    "it is also important to study if the gating action can be performed adiabatically , i.e. if during the evolution of the two - electron system there remains a finite gap between the ground and excited states.@xcite    wellard _ _ et al.__@xcite have extended these calculations to include the voltage dependence of the exchange coupling within the heitler - london framework .",
    "we hope to develop their results further by using our extended basis to calculate the voltage dependence of not only the exchange coupling , but also the energy spectrum of the two - electron system , and double occupancy probability of the ground states .",
    "the energy spectrum informs us if during the gating action , the coupled donor system is well isolated , and the higher excited states can be safely neglected .",
    "in addition , the double occupancy probability gives us an estimate of the error rate .",
    "however , including the electric field is a very computationally intensive task , as it requires evaluating the basis functions on our grid , over a much greater range of device parameters , which is by far the most time consuming part for our calculations .",
    "the results presented here using effective mass theory provide a solid foundation for future device modelling . ongoing work on this project",
    "is focusing on extending the multi valley calculations to investigate the effect of gate voltage on the oscillations in the exchange coupling .",
    "one would expect that as the gate voltage is turned on , it will become more favorable for the donor wave function to distort toward the gate . as a result",
    ", the donor wave function no longer has equal contributions from all six valleys , and the oscillations may smooth out as the inter valley interference effects decrease .",
    "we will need to implement the full molecular orbital approach to obtain the higher excited two - electron states accurately . thus using this method we gain insight not only into the exchange coupling and double occupancy probability , but also the conditions required to perform adiabatic gate operations . to make these calculations more tractable",
    ", we envisage that the hund - mulliken basis should suffice in calculating the exchange coupling over a greater range of device parameters , as we have shown here that this is the best compromise between accuracy and speed .",

    "<S> we theoretically study the hilbert space structure of two neighbouring p donor electrons in silicon - based quantum computer architectures . to use electron spins as qubits , a crucial condition is the isolation of the electron spins from their environment , including the electronic orbital degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> we provide detailed electronic structure calculations of both the single donor electron wave function and the two - electron pair wave function . </S>",
    "<S> we adopted a molecular orbital method for the two - electron problem , forming a basis with the calculated single donor electron orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> our two - electron basis contains many singlet and triplet orbital excited states , in addition to the two simple ground state singlet and triplet orbitals usually used in the heitler - london approximation to describe the two - electron donor pair wave function . </S>",
    "<S> we determined the excitation spectrum of the two - donor system , and study its dependence on strain , lattice position and inter donor separation . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to determine how isolated the ground state singlet and triplet orbitals are from the rest of the excited state hilbert space . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to calculating the energy spectrum , we are also able to evaluate the exchange coupling between the two donor electrons , and the double occupancy probability that both electrons will reside on the same p donor . </S>",
    "<S> these two quantities are very important for logical operations in solid - state quantum computing devices , as a large exchange coupling achieves faster gating times , whilst the magnitude of the double occupancy probability can affect the error rate . </S>"
