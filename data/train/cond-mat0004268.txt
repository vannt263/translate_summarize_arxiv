    "this conference is addressed to the extension of thermo - statistics to non - extensive systems .",
    "this is a new realm of thermo - statistics which came into focus by the pioneering work of tsallis @xcite .",
    "non - extensive systems are defined by the following property : if they are divided into pieces , their energy and entropy is not the sum of the energies and entropies of their parts in contrast to conventional extensive systems where this is assumed at least if the pieces are themselves macroscopic .",
    "this is the case if the forces in the systems have a long range comparable with or larger than the linear dimensions of the system like for nuclei , atomic clusters and astrophysical objects .",
    "however , also inhomogeneous systems , e.g. systems with separated phases are non - extensive .",
    "although the largest possible systems like clusters of galaxies belong to this group i call these systems `` small '' to stress the fact that the thermodynamic limit either does not exist or makes no sense . for systems with short range forces",
    "does the entropy of the surfaces separating the different phases not scale with the volume of the system .",
    "the entropy per particle @xmath4 shows a convex intruder with a depth @xmath5 .",
    "as long as one cares about this non - concavity also these systems are to be considered as non - extensive .",
    "elliot lieb , boltzmann laureate from 1998 , claims @xcite `` extensivity is essential for thermodynamics to work ! ''",
    "this is certainly true for the original statistical foundation of thermodynamics by gibbs @xcite . for the extension of thermo - statistics to non - extensive , `` small '' systems one should",
    ", however , remember that the original formulation by boltzmann , even though he did presumably not think of non - extensive systems , does not rely on the use of the thermodynamic limit nor any assumption of extensivity and concavity of the entropy , see below .",
    "hence , before introducing any major deviation from standard equilibrium statistics one should explore its original and fundamental boltzmann , or micro - canonical , form .",
    "this is what i will do in the following and demonstrate that lieb s claim is wrong and contradicts to boltzmann s view of thermodynamics .",
    "_ entropy as defined by boltzmann does not invoke the thermodynamic limit and , consequently , does not demand extensivity .",
    "_ moreover , it will even turn out that the non - extensivity of inhomogeneous systems with separated phases gives just a clou to illuminate the physics of phase transitions explicitly and sharply .",
    "there is a huge world of non - extensive systems which can only be described by boltzmann s micro - canonical ensemble written in its most condensed form on the epitaph of his gravestone which covers all equilibrium thermodynamics :    where @xmath6 is the volume of the @xmath7 dimensional manifold at given sharp energy , the micro - canonical ensemble .",
    "( @xmath8 is a suitable small energy constant to make the @xmath9 dimensionless . )    in his famous book `` elementary principles in statistical physics '' gibbs deduced the canonical ensemble from the fundamental micro - canonical .",
    "he showed that the canonical one becomes equivalent to the micro - canonical ensemble _ in the thermodynamic limit if the system is homogeneous_. otherwise , the canonical and grand - canonical are not correct .",
    "on page 75 , chapter vii of @xcite he gives explicitly the example of the separation of the liquid and gas phase for which the canonical fluctuations of the energy per particle do not vanish even in the thermodynamic limit and the canonical ensemble , and with it the `` boltzmann - gibbs '' distribution loose their validity .",
    "the reason for the special fundamental role of the micro ensemble comes of course from the fact that the internal dynamics of a many - body system conserves energy and does not mix different energy shells . in an open system embedded in a heat bath the mechanism of energy violation operates via the surface between the system and the bath and is of the same order in the particle number @xmath10 as any other internal surface energies , which are also to be ignored in the canonical treatment .",
    "boltzmann defines the entropy in eq.([boltzm ] ) as a measure of the mechanical n - body phase space .",
    "thermodynamics has thus a _",
    "geometrical interpretation _ and can be read off from the _ topology _ of @xmath11 , the volume of its constant energy manifold .",
    "no probabilistic interpretation must be invoked like @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the probability to find the n - particle configuration @xmath14 in the ensemble .",
    "this form of entropy can be investigated for any finite even `` small '' system without any reference to the thermodynamic limit .",
    "i will show here that all thermodynamical features of such a system including the whole `` zoo '' of phase transitions and critical phenomena can be read off from this topology .",
    "this proves that in contrast to what is written in most textbooks of statistical mechanics _ phase transitions do exist and can be sharply defined in finite even `` small '' and non - extensive systems_.    conventional thermo - statistics , however , relies heavily on the use of the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath15 ) and extensivity , c.f .",
    "e.g. the book of pathria @xcite .",
    "this is certainly not allowed for our systems . that the _ micro - canonical _ statistics works well also for `` small '' systems without invoking extensivity will be demonstrated here for finite normal systems which are also non - extensive at phase transitions of first order .",
    "the use of the thermodynamic limit and of extensivity , however , is closely intervowen with the development of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics since its beginning more than hundred years ago .",
    "when we extend thermodynamics to `` small '' systems we should establish the formalism of thermodynamics starting from mechanics in order to remain on a firm basis .",
    "we will see how this idea guides us to more and deeper insight into the most dramatic phenomena of thermodynamics , phase transitions .",
    "moreover , it gives the most natural extension of thermo - statistics to many non - extensive systems without invoking any modification of the entropy like that proposed by tsallis @xcite .",
    "this discussion may further help to illuminate the domain of physical situations where the tsallis formalism is relevant : systems that do not populate the energy manifold of phase space densely perhaps in a fractal way , perhaps at the edge of chaos c.f.@xcite .",
    "i will sketch a deduction of thermo - statistics from the principles of mechanics alone .",
    "nothing outside of mechanics must be invoked .",
    "this was the starting point of boltzmann @xcite , gibbs @xcite , einstein @xcite and the ehrenfests @xcite at the beginning of the last century .",
    "they all agreed on the logical hierarchy of the micro - canonical as the most fundamental ensemble from which the canonical , and grand - canonical ensembles can be deduced under certain conditions .",
    "according to gibbs the latter two approximate the micro ensemble in the thermodynamic limit of infinitely many particles interacting by short range interactions if the system is homogeneous . then surface effects and fluctuations can be ignored relatively to the bulk mean values .",
    "this is the main reason why the thermodynamic limit became basic in the statistical foundation of macroscopic thermodynamics .",
    "however , it was gibbs @xcite who stressed that the equivalence of the three ensembles is not true at phase transitions of first order , even in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the link between the micro and the grand ensemble is established by the double laplace transform : @xmath16 } } = \\frac{v^2}{\\epsilon_0}{\\int\\rule{-3.5mm}{0mm}\\int}_0^{\\infty } { de\\;dn\\;e^{-v[e / t+\\nu n - s(e , n)]}}\\label{grandsum}\\ ] ] globally @xmath17 is concave ( downwards bended ) . if @xmath18 is also locally concave then there is a single point @xmath19,@xmath20 for given @xmath21 as shown in figure ( [ concave ] ) with @xmath22 and a one to one mapping is generated by the laplace transform eq.([grandsum ] ) from the micro variables @xmath23 to the grand canonical @xmath21 .",
    "this is illustrated by figure ( [ concave ] ) for the case of a single conserved variable @xmath1 .",
    "in gaussian approximation @xmath24 remains under the tangent line and in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath25 ) only the immediate neighborhood of the stationary point contributes .",
    "the importance of the curvature of @xmath24 for the bijective mapping is evident .",
    "an equilibrated many - body system is characterized by few macroscopic quantities :    1 .   its energy @xmath1 , mass ( number of atoms ) @xmath2 , volume @xmath26 , 2 .",
    "its entropy @xmath0 eq.([boltzm ] ) , 3 .",
    "its temperature @xmath27 eq.([beta ] ) , pressure @xmath28 eq.([p ] ) , and chemical potential @xmath29 eq.([mu ] ) .",
    "there are important qualitative differences between these three groups : all variables of the first group have a clear mechanical significance .",
    "they are conserved and well defined at each point of the n - body phase space .",
    "the internal dynamics of the system can not leave the shell in phase space which is defined by these variables . also entropy as the most important quantity within thermodynamics has with eq.([boltzm ] ) a clear mechanical foundation since boltzmann .",
    "the set of points on this surface defines the micro - canonical ensemble .",
    "in contrast to the conserved quantities which are defined at each phase space point , entropy refers to the whole micro - canonical ensemble .",
    "remark : for a system with discrete energies @xmath30 with some degeneration @xmath31 e.g. a lattice or a quantum system one should define the micro - canonical partition sum by the number @xmath32 of states at this energy . when we discuss derivatives of @xmath9 we imagine a suitable smoothing of this .",
    "it is important to notice that boltzmann s and also einstein s formulation allows for _ defining the entropy entirely within mechanics _ by @xmath33",
    "_ it is a single valued , non - singular , in the classical case multiply differentiable function of all `` extensive '' , conserved dynamical variables_. no thermodynamic limit must be invoked and this definition applies to non - extensive like our `` small '' systems as well .",
    "the third group of quantities which characterize the thermodynamical state of an equilibrated many - body system , temperature @xmath27 , pressure @xmath28 and chemical potential @xmath29 have no immediate mechanical significance . from the mechanical point of view",
    "they are secondary , derived quantities .",
    "this difference to the two other groups of variables will turn out to be significant for `` small '' systems . again , like entropy itself , these quantities refer to the whole micro - canonical ensemble , not to an individual point in the n - body phase space .",
    "starting from this point , the conventional thermo - statistics assumes extensivity and explores the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath34 ) c.f .",
    "this procedure follows gibbs @xcite .",
    "he introduced the canonical ensemble , which since then became the basic of all modern thermo - statistics .",
    "this talk addresses phase transitions in `` small '' systems .",
    "conventionally phase transitions are thought to exist only in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "yang and lee @xcite define them by the singularities of the grand - canonical partition sum as function of the fugacity @xmath36 . as the partition sum",
    "@xmath37 is analytical in @xmath38 for finite volumes @xmath26 the singularities can occur in the thermodynamic limit only ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "i will show how these singularities arise from points in the parameter space \\{@xmath40 } where the micro - canonical ( boltzmann ) entropy @xmath18 has either vanishing or even positive curvature .",
    "these are the catastrophes of the laplace transform from the micro - canonical to the grand - canonical partition sum ( [ grandsum ] ) .    at phase transitions",
    "the inter - phase surface does not scale with the volume .",
    "systems with phase separation are non - extensive .",
    "these configurations become exponentially suppressed in the canonical ensemble @xcite .",
    "moreover , schrdinger thought that boltzmann s entropy is not usefull to describe systems other than gases @xcite .",
    "however , today with the powerfull and cheap computers we can explore the micro - canonical ensemble in realistic situation .",
    "the clarification the basic role of boltzmann s statistics in the most dramatic situations of equilibrium thermodynamics is demanding .",
    "to realize the powerful application of boltzmann s [ not boltzmann - gibbs ( ! ) ] statistics to non - extensive , finite systems having a non - concave entropy @xmath41 may also specify the cases where one has to go beyond and where a generalization like tsallis entropy is needed .    when there are no singularities in the partition sum @xmath37 for finite systems , are there no phase transitions in finite systems ? there are phenomena observed in finite systems which are typical for phase transitions .",
    "sometimes this is even so in astonishingly small systems like nuclei and atomic clusters of @xmath42 atoms @xcite . in chapter ( [ surftension ] ) and",
    "in reference @xcite we show that their characteristic parameters as transition temperature , latent heat , and _",
    "surface tension _ are  in the case of some metals  already for thousand atoms close , though of course not equal , to their known bulk values .",
    "therefore , it seems to be fully justified to speak in these cases of phase transitions of first order .",
    "we need an extension of thermodynamics to `` small '' systems which avoids the thermodynamic limit .",
    "however , here is a severe problem : _ the non - equivalence of the three popular ensembles , the micro - canonical , the canonical , and the grand - canonical ensembles for `` small '' systems . _ the energy _ per particle _ fluctuates around its mean value @xmath43 in the ( grand-)canonical ensemble whereas the energy fluctuations are zero in the micro - canonical ensemble .",
    "moreover , the heat capacity is strictly positive in the canonical ensembles whereas it may become _ negative _ in the micro ensemble . to extend themodynamics to `` small '' systems it is certainly advisable to keep close contact with mechanics .",
    "it is helpful to realize that the fundamental micro - canonical ensemble as introduced by boltzmann is the only one which has a clear mechanical definition @xcite for finite systems .    to extend the definition of phase transitions of yang and lee to finite systems we must study which feature of the micro - canonical partition sum @xmath44 leads to singularities of the grand - canonical potentials @xmath45 $ ] as function of @xmath46 by the laplace transform eq.([grandsum ] ) . in the thermodynamic limit",
    "@xmath47 this integral can be evaluated by asymptotic methods as discussed above .",
    "if there is only a single stationary point then there is a one to one mapping of the grand - canonical ensemble to the micro - canonical one and energy - fluctuations disappear @xmath48 .",
    "this , however , is not the case at phase transitions of first order . here",
    "the grand - canonical ensemble contains several gibbs states ( stationary points , c.f . the figure ( [ surftens ] ) ) at the same temperature and chemical potential which contribute similarly to the integral eq.([grandsum ] ) .",
    "the statistical fluctuations of @xmath49 and @xmath50 do not disappear in the grand - canonical ensemble even in the thermodynamic limit . between the stationary points _",
    "@xmath18 has at least one principal curvature @xmath51_. here van hove s concavity condition @xcite for the entropy @xmath18 is violated . in the thermodynamic limit",
    "these points get jumped over by the integral ( [ grandsum ] ) and @xmath52 $ ] becomes non - analytic .",
    "consequently , we _ define phase transitions also for finite systems topologically by the points and regions of non - negative curvature of the entropy surface @xmath18 as a function of the mechanical , conserved `` extensive '' quantities like energy , mass , angular momentum etc._.    the central quantity of our further discussion , the determinant of the curvatures of @xmath17 is defined as @xmath53 the two curvature eigenvalues ( main curvatures ) are assumed to be ordered and @xmath54 .",
    "also critical fluctuations , i.e. abnormally large fluctuations of some extensive variable in the grand - canonical ensemble or the eventual divergence of some susceptibilities are micro - canonically connected to the vanishing of the curvature determinant , e.g. in the following examples of @xmath55 or @xmath56 respectively : @xmath57 in the case of a classical continuous system @xmath18 is everywhere finite and multiply differentiable . in that case",
    "the inverse susceptibilities @xmath58^{-1}$ ] and @xmath59^{-1}$ ] are well behaved smooth functions of their arguments even at phase transitions .",
    "problems arise only if the susceptibilities are considered as functions of the `` intensive '' variables @xmath27 , and @xmath29 or @xmath60 @xcite . in the case of lattice systems",
    "we can only assume that the inverse susceptibilities are similarly well behaved .",
    "experimentally one identifies phase transitions of first order of course not by the non - analyticities of @xmath45 $ ] but by the interfaces separating coexisting phases , e.g. liquid and gas , i.e. by the _",
    "inhomogeneities _ of the system which become suppressed in the thermodynamic limit in the grand - canonical ensemble .",
    "this fact was early realized by gibbs @xcite and he emphasized that using @xmath0 vs. volume , or density , at phase separation `` has a substantial advantage over any other method ( e.g. pressure ) because it shows the region of simultaneous coexistence of the vapor , liquid , and solid phases of a substance , a region which reduces to a point in the more usual pressure - temperature plane . ''",
    "that is also the reason why for the grand - canonical ensemble the more mathematical definition of phase transitions @xcite is needed .",
    "the main advantage of the micro - canonical ensemble is that it allows for _ inhomogeneities _ as well and thus we can keep much closer to the experimental criteria for finding phase transitions .",
    "interfaces have three opposing effects on the entropy :    * an entropic _ gain _ by putting a part ( @xmath61 ) of the system from the majority phase ( e.g. solid ) into the minority phase ( bubbles , e.g. gas ) with a higher entropy per particle . however , this has to be paid by additional energy @xmath62 to break the bonds in the `` gas''-phase",
    ". as both effects are proportional to the number of particles @xmath61 being converted , this part of the entropy rises linearly with the additional energy . * with rising size of the bubbles their surfaces",
    "this is connected to an entropic _ loss _ due to additional correlations between the particles at the interface(surface entropy ) proportional to the interface area .",
    "as the number of surface atoms is @xmath63 this is not linear in @xmath62 and leads to a convex intruder in @xmath64 , the origin of surface tension @xcite .",
    "this is also the reason why systems with phase separation are non - extensive c.f .",
    "chapter ( [ secondlaw]).[surf ] * an additional mixing entropy for distributing the @xmath61-particles in various ways over the bubbles .    at a ( multi- ) critical point",
    "two ( or more ) phases become indistinguishable because the interface entropy ( surface tension ) and with it the inhomogeneity ( interface ) disappears .    in order to demonstrate this we investigate in the following the 3-states diluted potts model now on a _ finite _ 2-dim ( here @xmath65 ) lattice with periodic boundaries in order to minimize effects of the external surfaces of the system .",
    "the model is defined by the hamiltonian : @xmath66 each lattice site @xmath14 is either occupied by a particle with spin @xmath67 or empty ( vacancy ) .",
    "the sum is over neighboring lattice sites @xmath68 , and the occupation numbers are : @xmath69    this model is an extension of the ordinary ( @xmath70)-potts model to allow also for vacancies . at zero concentration of vacancies ( @xmath71 ) ,",
    "the system has in the limit of infinite volume @xmath26 a continuous phase transition at @xmath72@xcite . with rising number of vacancies the probability to find a pair of particles at neighboring sites with the same spin orientation decreases .",
    "the inclusion of vacancies has the effect of an increasing effective @xmath73 .",
    "this results in an increase of the critical energy of the continuous phase transition with decreasing @xmath50 and provides a line of continuous transition , which is supposed to terminate when @xmath74 becomes larger than @xmath75 , where the transition becomes first order .    at smaller energies the system is in one of three ordered phases ( spins predominantly parallel in one of the three possible directions ) .",
    "we call this the `` solid '' phase .",
    "this scenario gets full support by our numerical findings .    in figure ( [ det ] ) the determinant of curvatures of @xmath18 :",
    "@xmath76 is shown .",
    "on the diagonal we have the ground - state of the @xmath77-dim potts lattice - gas with @xmath78 , the upper - right end is the complete random configuration ( here without contour lines ) , with the maximum allowed excitation @xmath79 and the maximum possible entropy . in the region above the line @xmath80 we have the disordered , `` gas '' . here",
    "the entropy @xmath18 is concave ( @xmath81 ) , both curvatures are negative ( we have always the smaller one @xmath82 ) .",
    "this is also the case inside the triangle @xmath83@xmath84@xmath85 ( ordered , `` solid '' phase ) . in these regions",

    "the cross - section through @xmath180 at constant @xmath177 along the bold lines from fig.([sintens ] ) is shown in figure ( [ sbetaless ] ) below the multi - critical point @xmath181 and in figure ( [ sbetahigh ] ) above it .",
    "the latter clearly shows the back - bending of @xmath180 .",
    "at this point it is worth - wile to spend some words on a popular misunderstanding connected with the eventual convexity of the entropy as function of `` extensive '' quantities like the energy : the convex parts of @xmath3 violate van hove",
    "s concavity condition @xcite .",
    "one may believe that this is also a contradiction to the second law of thermodynamics : at a convex region of @xmath3 a split of the system into two pieces with entropies @xmath182 and @xmath183 would have @xmath184 .",
    "so the system seems to _ gain _ entropy by splitting .",
    "this , however , is an error .",
    "the boltzmann entropy as defined in eq.([boltzm ] ) is already the logarithm of the sum over _ all _ possible configurations of the system at the given energy .",
    "the split ones are a subset of these .",
    "their partial phase space @xmath185 is of course @xmath186 the total @xmath9 . the entropy @xmath187 is @xmath186 the total entropy . evidently , the split system looses some surface entropy @xmath188 at the separation boundary due to additional correlations imposed on the particles at the boundary .",
    "the entropy after split is consequently : @xmath189 it is a typical finite size effect .",
    "@xmath190 vanishes in the limit @xmath25 for interactions with _",
    "finite _ range .",
    "the entropy is non - extensive for finite systems but becomes extensive in the limit , and van hove s theorem @xcite is fulfilled .",
    "this is of course only under the condition that @xmath191 .",
    "so in the case of a self - gravitating system the convex intruder and the negative specific heat will not disappear @xcite .",
    "in general this is of course a trivial conclusion : an additional constraint like an artificial cut of the system can only reduce phase space and entropy .",
    "the second law is automatically satisfied in the boltzmann formalism whether @xmath0 is concave or not , whether @xmath0 is `` extensive '' or not .",
    "a positive ( wrong ) curvature introduces problems to the geometrical interpretation of thermodynamics as formulated by weinhold @xcite which relies on the non - convexity of @xmath3 .",
    "weinhold introduces a metric like @xmath192g_{ik}[x^k(a)-x^k(b)]}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] evidently , a negative metric @xmath193 is here not allowed .",
    "of course weinhold s theory does not apply to finite systems with phase transitions .",
    "micro - canonical thermo - statistics describes how the entropy @xmath18 as defined entirely in mechanical terms by boltzmann depends on the conserved `` extensive '' variables : energy @xmath49 , particle number @xmath50 , angular momentum @xmath194 etc .",
    "it is well defined for finite systems without invoking the thermodynamic limit .",
    "thus in contrast to the conventional theory , we can study phase transitions also in `` small '' systems or other non - extensive systems . in this simulation",
    "we could classify phase transitions in a `` small '' system by the topological properties of the determinant of curvatures @xmath55 , eq.([curvdet ] ) of the micro - canonical entropy - surface @xmath18 :      * a * single stable * phase by @xmath195 ( @xmath196 ) . here",
    "@xmath3 is concave in both directions .",
    "then there is a one to one mapping of canonical@xmath197micro - ensemble . +",
    "then the last two terms in @xmath198 can be neglected for large volume . *",
    "a * transition of first order * with phase separation and surface tension is indicated by @xmath199 ( @xmath119 ) .",
    "@xmath3 has a convex intruder in the direction @xmath200 of the largest curvature .",
    "because of @xmath201 the second last term in eq.([asympt ] ) is complex or diverges .",
    "+ the whole convex area of \\{e , n } is mapped into a single point in the canonical ensemble.[convex ] + i.e. if the curvature of @xmath18 is @xmath202 * both ensembles are not equivalent . * * a * continuous ( `` second order '' ) * transition with vanishing surface tension , where two neighboring phases become indistinguishable , is indicated by lines ( critical ) with @xmath89 and @xmath203 .",
    "these are the catastrophes of the laplace transform @xmath204 * finally a * multi - critical point * where more than two phases become indistinguishable is at the branching of several lines with @xmath205 , @xmath206 .",
    "our classification of phase transitions by the topological structure of the micro - canonical boltzmann entropy @xmath18 is close to the natural experimental way to identify phase transitions of first order by the inhomogeneities at phase separation boundaries .",
    "this is possible because the micro - canonical ensemble does not suppress inhomogeneities in contrast to the grand - canonical one , as was emphasized already by gibbs @xcite .",
    "inter - phase boundaries are reflected in `` small '' systems by a convex intruder in the entropy surface .",
    "with this extension of the definition of phase transitions to `` small '' systems there are remarkable similarities with the transitions of the bulk . moreover",
    ", this definition agrees with the conventional definition in the thermodynamic limit ( of course , in the thermodynamic limit the largest curvature @xmath94 approaches @xmath207 from above at phase transitions of first order ) .",
    "the region of phase separation remains inaccessible in the conventional grand - canonical ensemble .",
    "we believe , however , that the various kind of transitions discussed here have their immediate meaning in `` small '' and non - extensive systems independently whether they are the same in the thermodynamic limit ( if this then exist ) or not . for systems like the potts model that have a thermodynamic limit it might well be possible that the character of the transition changes towards larger system size .    the great conceptual clarity of micro - canonical thermo - statistics compared to the grand - canonical one",
    "is clearly demonstrated . not only that",
    ", we showed that the micro - canonical statistics gives more information about the thermodynamic behavior and more insight into the mechanism of phase transitions than the canonical ensemble : about half of the whole \\{e , n } space , the intruder of @xmath3 or the region between the ground state and the line @xmath86 in figure ( [ det ] ) , gets lost in conventional grand - canonical thermodynamics . without any doubts this contains the most sophisticated and interesting physics of this system .",
    "we emphasized this point already in @xcite there , however , with still limited precision .",
    "due to our refined simulation method @xcite this could be demonstrated here with uniformly good precision in the whole \\{@xmath23 } plane .",
    "it turns out that not only are non - extensive systems a new and rich realm for thermodynamics but moreover _ non - extensivity makes phase transitions much more transparant _ which is no surprise as phase transitions of first order are coupled to situations where a system _ prefers to become inhomogeneous , i.e. non - extensive_.    finally , we should mention that micro - canonical thermo - statistics allowed us to compute phase transitions and especially the surface tension in realistic systems like small metal clusters @xcite .",
    "our finding @xcite clearly disproves the pessimistic judgement by schrdinger @xcite who thought that boltzmann s entropy is only usefull for gases .",
    "a recent application of micro - canonical thermo - statistics to thermodynamically unstable , collapsing systems under high angular momentum is found at @xcite .",
