    "neutrino data hint at the possibility of something beyond three massive , mostly active neutrinos .",
    "the lsnd result of @xmath2  @xcite can be explained if there exist one sterile neutrino , with @xmath3 with respect to other neutrinos .",
    "this lead to the so - called `` ev seesaw '' scenario  @xcite , where the right - handed neutrino majorana scale @xmath0 is taken to be of ev order . in 2006 ,",
    "the ev seesaw scenario was extended to four lepton generations  @xcite .",
    "the fourth generation gives rise to a heavy pseudo - dirac neutral lepton , which largely decouples from the other generations , and is relatively stable .",
    "the framework gives naturally 3 active and 3 sterile neutrinos ( 3 + 3 ) .",
    "motivated by the interpretation of the @xmath4 excess observed by lsnd in terms of @xmath5 antineutrino oscillations , the miniboone ( mb ) experiment was constructed . in 2007 ,",
    "the miniboone collaboration presented  @xcite their first results of a search for @xmath6 neutrino oscillations , which did not support the lsnd excess , but some excess at low energy was not fully understood . taking this result into account , maltoni and schwetz  @xcite found that the 3 + 2 scheme can fit both lsnd @xmath7 data and mb @xmath8 data , and at the same time account for the excess of low energy events in mb data .",
    "more recently , the miniboone collaboration reported their latest data , updating neutrino results  @xcite ( including the low energy region ) , as well as the first antineutrino results  @xcite , and first results from the off - axis numi beam observed in the miniboone detector  @xcite .",
    "motivated by these new results , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite re - examined the 3 + 1 and 3 + 2 global fits to the short - baseline ( sbl ) data .",
    "they found that the 3 + 2 oscillation hypothesis provides only a marginally better description of all sbl data over the 3 + 1 oscillation hypothesis .",
    "in addition , a 3 + 1 fit to all antineutrino sbl data ( miniboone(@xmath9 ) , lsnd , karmen  @xcite , bugey  @xcite , and chooz  @xcite ) can yield @xmath10 @xmath11-probability and high compatibility .",
    "in this paper we update the previous numerical analysis of the 3 + 3 study of the lsnd anomaly , taking into account mb data .",
    "in particular , we consider the implications for the third mixing angle , and cp violation .",
    "the outline is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we update the previous numerical solutions by inputting the latest neutrino oscillation parameters from global data . in sec .",
    "iii we add the cp violation phases to the leptonic mixing matrix and investigate the effect of phase factors , and give a short summary in sec .",
    "in ref .  @xcite , maltoni and schwetz discussed different types of oscillation frameworks that include one or more sterile neutrinos at the ev scale , by considering the global short - baseline ( sbl ) experiments data which included the miniboone first result  @xcite . the analysis built on an earlier study which showed that miniboone ( 2007 ) , lsnd , and the null appearance experiments ( karmen and nomad  @xcite ) are compatible under a 3 + 2 sterile neutrino oscillation scenario with large cp violation .",
    "recently , in light of recently published results from the miniboone experiment  @xcite , karagiorgi _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite re - examined sterile neutrino oscillation models .",
    "they found that , with the addition of the new miniboone data sets , a 3 + 2 oscillation hypothesis provides only a marginally better description of all short - baseline data over a 3 + 1 oscillation hypothesis . on the other hand",
    ", fits to antineutrino - only data sets , including appearance and disappearance experiments , are found significantly more compatible , even within a 3 + 1 oscillation scenario .",
    "we shall therefore use the best - fit values for mass splittings and mixing angles obtained from 3 + 1 fits to all antineutrino sbl data in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the corresponding projected value of the lsnd probability @xmath12  @xcite .",

    "these are given explicitly in table i. we also include the projected value of @xmath12  @xcite , and require @xmath48 as in the previous analysis .",

    "one could say that the agreement between the scenario of ev seesaw with four generations and the experimental data has improved .",
    "the plausible value for @xmath35 , the target of daya bay and t2k experimemnts , is of great interest . to discuss this , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we restrict the @xmath45 to the four inputs of @xmath47 and @xmath62 . with @xmath50 and @xmath49 given as in table iii , we first fix @xmath66 , the best fit value , and perform a @xmath45 fit vs @xmath67 and @xmath68 , then iterate with fixing @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) and minimize @xmath45 vs @xmath71 and @xmath68 ( @xmath71 and @xmath67 ) .",
    "we find for both cases of fixing @xmath71 or @xmath68 to the best fit values , @xmath31 is quite strongly dependent on @xmath67 , and the value around 0.9999 is preferred .",

    "the regions in different shades are only indicative , and should not be interpreted as the @xmath13 , @xmath72 and @xmath14 regions , as the rest of the parameters are fixed at the best fit values .",

    "1 we show the @xmath45 contour plot vs @xmath73 .",
    "the three different shaded regions should not be interpreted as the @xmath13 , @xmath72 and @xmath14 regions , since we have fixed the rest of the parameters to the best fit values .",
    "but they do give an indication of variations around the best fit region under the above assumptions .",
    "the gross features are not too different from the 2006 study . for the lower right solution ,",
    "@xmath71 has moved closer to zero , and the strength of @xmath68 has also weakened a little . for the upper left solution , @xmath68 is little changed , but @xmath71 has strengthened considerably , moving the solution more into the corner .    , @xmath27 , @xmath31 and @xmath35 vs @xmath71 and @xmath68 , corresponding to the lower right solution in fig .",
    "1 , with @xmath50 and @xmath49 fixed as in table iii , and @xmath67 fixed at 0.9999.,scaledwidth=45.0%,scaledwidth=45.0% ]        we plot in fig .",
    "2 the four quantities @xmath74 , @xmath27 , @xmath31 and @xmath35 vs @xmath71 and @xmath68 , for the solution on the lower right of fig",
    ". 1 . the same is plotted in fig .  3 for the upper left solution .",
    "again , @xmath50 and @xmath49 are fixed as in table iii , and @xmath67 is held fixed at 0.9999 .",
    "the dependence on @xmath71@xmath68 , or shape , for @xmath62 differs somewhat from the 2006 case , with the lower right solution now allowing larger values .",
    "we see that @xmath62 can reach @xmath75 and @xmath27 is well within range , and likewise for @xmath31 .",
    "however , to push @xmath35 beyond 0.025 , @xmath31 would start to wander away from maximal mixing of 0.5 , and values at @xmath76 or 0.6 has to be tolerated .",
    "the situation is not much changed from 2006 , but we note that the slightly more promising situation for @xmath35 can be traced to the more positive input value in table ii , which now does include sbl data .",
    "the sign of @xmath77 is undetermined by present data ( e.g. minos experiment ) .",
    "that is to say , the neutrino mass hierarchy is not known at this time .",
    "we use ev seesaw with four generations scenario to see if we can gain any access to the neutrino mass hierarchy . for normal mass hierarchy ,",
    "the sign of @xmath77 is positive and the best fit value is @xmath78 , and the numerical analysis has been performed in the previous section . for inverted mass hierarchy ,",
    "the sign of @xmath77 is negative with best fit value @xmath79 . to perform the numerical analysis for inverted mass hierarchy",
    ", we use the best fit values given as in table iii but only replacing that of @xmath77 by @xmath79 to work out @xmath45 minimum . comparing with the @xmath45 minimum for normal mass hierarchy",
    ", we find @xmath80 in obvious notation .",
    "it seems that the agreement of ev seesaw with four generations scenario with normal mass hierarchy is slightly better than the agreement with inverted mass hierarchy .",
    "we caution that our study is not a true fit , as there are too many model parameters .",
    "so far , we have not considered cp violation effect , and all phases in the leptonic mixing matrix were set to zero for simplicity , just as in the previous paper  @xcite . as defined in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the rotation matrices which diagonalize the neutrino and charged - lepton mass matrices , respectively , and the full leptonic mixing matrix is @xmath83 .",
    "although introducing cp violation phase to the leptonic mixing matrix adds further to the already many parameters , there is some motivation to study cp violation effect , in part because there are both neutrino and antineutrino oscillation data , and they appear to be somewhat different .",
    "we shall therefore give two examples for illustration .",
    "as charged lepton masses are generated by the higgs mechanism , similar to quark masses , we take the left sector rotation matrix @xmath82 to be the usual form @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the cp violation phase and placed in the @xmath86 element of @xmath82 . because of the presence of @xmath85 , the formulas for @xmath87 would no longer be equal to that of @xmath88 .",
    "we use this new @xmath82 matrix with cp violation phase @xmath85 , and the best fit values given as in table ii for inputs , and redo our numerical analysis .",
    "after minimization , we get the new @xmath45 minimum , i.e. @xmath89 .",
    "we find that introducing cp phase @xmath85 leads to the relative improvement of the fit of @xmath90 which is negligible .",
    "the quality of the global fit does not improve at all by introducing cp violation phase .",
    "but this is somewhat trivial , since table ii tacitly assumes cp conservation .",
    "ccc & input & +   + @xmath39 & @xmath40 & @xmath91 + @xmath92 & @xmath93 & @xmath94 + @xmath15 & @xmath16 & @xmath16 + @xmath19 & @xmath42 & @xmath42 + @xmath43 & @xmath44 & @xmath44 + @xmath27 & @xmath28 & @xmath28 + @xmath31 & @xmath32 & @xmath95 + @xmath35 & @xmath36 & @xmath96 +      the updated miniboone @xmath6 result indicates an excess of @xmath97 events at low energy , but no @xmath6 oscillations at the @xmath98 of the lsnd excess , which is for antineutrinos .",
    "furthermore , neither numi  @xcite nor nomad  @xcite found evidence for @xmath6 oscillations .",
    "thus , we consider @xmath99 at @xmath100 as a new additional input , to illustrate an extreme situation where there is a striking difference between the behavior of @xmath6 and @xmath101 oscillations .",
    "we stress that this is only an illustration , since neither the lsnd effect for @xmath101 oscillations , nor the absence of @xmath8 , are firmly established .",
    "furthermore , we clearly have too many parameters , hence we are just performing @xmath45 illustrations , not a fit .    the new ad hoc input , together with the 7 inputs of table ii , are now listed in table v , with which we build the new @xmath45 in the framework with cp violation . after minimizing the @xmath45",
    ", we use the thirteen parameter values of the best fit point to get the the expectation values for the eight observables , which are listed in the third column in table v. there is now a slight tension in @xmath102 ( though allowed ) , while neither the antineutrino , nor the neutrino oscillation probabilities can reach the input values , but this may be reasonable .",
    "the best fit value of cp violation phase @xmath85 is @xmath103 , or of order @xmath104 , which is of course rather large .",
    "note also that the @xmath35 value is now larger than in table ii , which is again reasonable , since a finite @xmath35 is a prerequisite for cp violation .",
    "this illustrates the efficacy of the daya bay and t2k experiments , as well as a future cpv program .",
    "we have updated the numerics of a 3 + 3 active / sterile neutrino picture , which arises naturally from a four lepton generation model with ev seesaw , i.e. with right - handed majorana mass scale @xmath0 at ev order .",
    "the major new data are the miniboone results of the past few years , which do not confirm the lsnd @xmath105 result .",
    "since the 3 + 3 model has too many parameters , while data is more or less consistent with a 3 + 1 picture , we take global fit results using the latter framework as input , and use a @xmath45 minimization to find the best values for neutrino mass differences , mixing angles , and @xmath105 probability .",
    "not unexpectedly , the consistency of the 3 + 3 picture with current data improves over the consistency with data in 2006 .",
    "we continue to find it difficult for @xmath35 to be larger than 2.5% , while finding a slightly better @xmath45 for normal mass hierarchy over the inverted mass hierarchy .",
    "these , however , could be artefacts of not being able to do a real fit .    if one continues to take the lsnd @xmath105 result seriously ( which provides the ev scale ) , together with the consensus of null results for @xmath6 oscillations , we have put in the cp violation phase in the charged lepton mixing matrix , and illustrated the possibility of cp violation .",
    "the world of large cp violation effect in @xmath105 vs @xmath6 oscillations , with large cpv phase and finite @xmath35 , could be a striking one .",
    "0.3 cm * note added*.  our table i uses version 2 of ref .",
    "@xcite , which is the published one .",
    "subsequently , these authors have posted version 3 on the arxiv , which includes new results on @xmath97 appearance from minos , which leads to a smaller @xmath35 ( best fit at 0.008 ) .",
    "however , we have discussed how things will be for a lower @xmath35 , so we leave the paper as is .",
