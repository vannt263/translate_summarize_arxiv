    "in this section technical details of magnetization - induced optical second harmonic generation ( mshg ) in the eu@xmath0gd@xmath1o system are given .",
    "this includes a discussion of the coupling effects and the electronic states involved in the mshg process .",
    "furthermore , details on the experiment confirming that the shg process probes the spin dynamics and is not influenced by other carrier - related nonequilibrium effects are provided .",
    "the photo - absorption and -emission constituting the shg process can be parametrized by a multipole expansion of the coupling of the light field to the system . in the leading order of this expansion",
    ", we get electric dipole ( ed ) transitions and , hence , shg is described by the relation @xcite , @xmath59 here , @xmath60 represents the electric - field components of the incident light wave at @xmath25 whereas @xmath61 represents the nonlinear electric polarization induced at @xmath62 which acts as source of a light wave of intensity @xmath63 . the nonlinear susceptibility",
    "@xmath64 incorporates the crystal structure , the electronic states , and the symmetry of the nonlinear material .",
    "shg according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : ed - shg ] ) is only allowed in non - centrosymmetric media . in centrosymmetric compounds like euo",
    ", shg becomes allowed only in higher orders of the multipole expansion , that is , to leading order , when one magnetic dipole ( md ) is taken into account .",
    "in addition , ed - shg as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ed - shg ] ) may also originate at the surface where space inversion symmetry is always broken .",
    "for centrosymmetric euo , bulk - generated md - shg according to @xmath65 was identified in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite . here ,",
    "@xmath66 and @xmath67 denote contributions with linear coupling to , respectively , the paramagnetic crystal or the magnetic order @xcite . in the ( 001)-oriented euo films investigated by us ,",
    "the non - magnetic shg contributions according to @xmath66 can not be excited @xcite . with the normal - incidence transmission setup sketched in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the aforementioned surface ( non - magnetic ) ed - shg contributions can not be excited either , since in this geometry the shg process only involves in - plane components of the light field , which are not sensitive to the inversion symmetry breaking by the surface .",
    "thus , in our experiments , shg should provide a background - free probe of the magnetic order .",
    "this is confirmed by the emergence of the shg signal at @xmath16 .",
    "likewise , the linear dependence of the shg intensity on the thickness of the euo films corroborates that shg couples to the bulk of the euo films @xcite .",
    "microscopically , mshg in eu@xmath0gd@xmath1o is based on a two - photon transition from the @xmath17 ground state to the @xmath8 conduction band @xcite .",
    "the band state at @xmath68  ev is resonantly excited and there may be further resonance enhancement by the @xmath11 exciton state near @xmath69  ev .",
    "this is reminiscent of the doubly resonant md - shg process observed in nio @xcite .    in eu@xmath0gd@xmath1o",
    "we identify experimentally a linear dependence of the shg amplitude on the value of the effective exchange interaction @xmath15 ; see main text .",
    "this is a clear indication that the two - photon absorption in eu@xmath0gd@xmath70o is assisted by an interaction process between the local spin magnetic moments . as an explanation for the linear @xmath15-dependence",
    ", we thus speculate that this _ local _ interaction process provides momentum transfer to the photoexcited carriers and thus facilitates the resonant @xmath9-@xmath10 transition . in principle such a coupling can be expressed by expanding in powers of @xmath15 , and according to our experiment the leading , first - order contribution is dominant .",
    "( a detailed analysis of the two - photon excitation processes is currently in progress . )",
    "measurements , as in fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) , clearly demonstrate that the shg process in eu@xmath0gd@xmath1o couples linearly to the magnetic order of the sample .",
    "this might , however , no longer be the case when the magnetic state of a sample is investigated in the non - equilibrium state acquired after intense photoexcitation . the redistribution of the charge carriers by the pump pulse and the ensuing relaxation dynamics may also influence the mshg signal .    in order to scrutinize this issue we performed time - resolved linear transmission measurements on the eu@xmath0gd@xmath1o system .",
    "the transmittance ( or reflectance ) is an established probe for studying charge - carrier dynamics because it directly reproduces the population of the electronic states affected by the pump pulse @xcite .",
    "the linear transmittance at the photon energies of the fundamental and the frequency - doubled light expresses a highly complex dynamics that remains to be understood ( experimental and theoretical investigations are in progress ) . but",
    "even without having achieved such understanding yet none of the dynamics seen in the transmittance transients is reproduced in the mshg scan and vice versa .",
    "we can therefore conclude that the mshg process truly probes the magnetic order whereas , within our resolution , it is insensitive to the charge carrier dynamics .",
    "with respect to the effective coupling @xmath15 this means that the mshg transient includes contributions by the virtual ( undoped ground state ) or the real ( gd- or photo - generated ) occupation of the @xmath10 orbitals .    another carrier - related contribution to the shg signal",
    "that might be suspected is related to the absorption of the pump light .",
    "it leads to an exponential decrease of the pump - light intensity and , hence , of the density of photoexcited carriers across the thickness of the eu@xmath0gd@xmath1o films .",
    "the carrier density gradient breaks the inversion symmetry and might lead to additional shg tensor components .",
    "the presence of such contributions in the mshg signal can , however , be excluded for three reasons .",
    "first , its temporal evolution would reflect that of the transmittance at @xmath25 .",
    "yet , such shg contributions were not detected .",
    "second , the absorption of the pump light is so moderate that the related carrier density changes by a factor of less than two across the films investigated by us .",
    "third , carrier gradient contributions to shg would occur below and above the magnetic ordering temperature . above @xmath16 the shg signal in the photoexcited samples is , however , zero at all delays .",
    "after photoexcitation of the non - equilibrium @xmath9-@xmath10 exciton population , it will take a certain time @xmath41 for the magnetic rkky correlations in the @xmath8 conduction band and , hence , for the @xmath15 enhancement to be established .",
    "as stated in the main text , @xmath41 can be estimated from the time it takes the electronic correlation to spread through the system .",
    "the relevant distance is the rkky wavelength , and the propagation velocity is the group velocity of the magnetic exciton , which is effectively reduced with respect to the conduction electron group velocity by the ratio @xmath71 of the effective masses of the @xmath8 conduction electrons ( @xmath72 ) and of the heavy holes in the @xmath9 band ( @xmath73 ) , which together form the magnetic exciton .",
    "this effective mass ratio was taken to be equal to the inverse ratio of the respective band widths and was extracted from literature data @xcite to be in the order of @xmath74 .",
    "in addition , we assume a parabolic conduction bands ( appropriate for our low excitation energy within the conduction band of @xmath75  ev ) . with @xmath76",
    "we thus obtain a buildup time @xmath41 of about 10  ps which is in good agreement with the measured value of @xmath403  ps in fig .",
    "the rkky - like magnetic coupling and , hence , the photoinduced enhancement of @xmath15 are proportional to the density of photoexcited non - thermalized conduction electrons which , in turn , is proportional to the conduction electron density of states , @xmath77 , at the final - state energy of the photoexcited electrons , @xmath78 .",
    "as earlier calculations have shown @xcite , this density of states is sensitively affected by the gd - doping concentration @xmath20 .",
    "increasing @xmath20 leads to a downward shift of spectral weight and an enhancement of @xmath77 for the photon energy @xmath79  ev used in our experiments .",
    "we have calculated the rkky coupling produced by the photoinduced , non - equilibrium electron population in the conduction band , where the latter is renormalized by the presence of the gd impurities as described above @xcite . for @xmath20 in the order of 1% , this coupling is ferromagnetic and increasing with @xmath20 , whereas for growing @xmath20 it acquires increasingly antiferromagnetic contributions . in order to extract the effective exchange coupling as a single number that can be compared with the experiment , first the curie temperature @xmath16 was calculated for the long - range rkky coupling using mean - field theory .",
    "the effective exchange coupling @xmath80 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) was then determined as the effective nearest - neighbor coupling within a heisenberg model displaying the same value of @xmath81 .",
    "the interplay of the @xmath20-dependent increase of density of states and of the increasingly antiferromagnetic rkky contributions leads to the non - monotonous behavior of @xmath82 depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) .",
    "thermalization processes becoming more effective for larger @xmath20 may lead to an additional reduction of @xmath80 at @xmath83% .",

    "<S> the intra - atomic @xmath9-@xmath10 exchange energy of @xmath38  ev @xcite corresponds to a time of @xmath39  fs so that an instantaneous mshg increase after photoexcitation might be expected in contrast to the strikingly different time of @xmath403  ps . </S>",

    "<S> figure  [ fig3 ] shows the temporal evolution of the normalized change of mshg intensity induced by optical pumping for gd concentrations between 0 and 19.5% . a common behavior of all samples is the decreasing mshg yield on a ns time scale . </S>",

    "<S> further gd doping reduces its magnitude , and at @xmath43  5% an ultrafast _ decrease _ of the mshg signal is observed . in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> , @xmath7 has been derived for each gd concentration @xmath20 from the relation displayed in the inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](a ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the growth of the mshg response @xmath45 with increasing gd concentration occurring on the ps time scale is striking . according to the widely used 3tm @xcite , the optical pump pulse would , in addition to exciting the localized @xmath9 electrons and creating the @xmath11 magnetic excitons , lead to the excitation of the chemically doped carriers in the @xmath8 conduction band and to their thermalization at the elevated temperature corresponding to the deposited energy . </S>",
    "<S> this would invariably _ reduce _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath15 since the magnetic coupling with electrons in the energetically higher band states becomes increasingly antiferromagnetic because of their increased wave number . </S>",
    "<S> ( this was checked by explicitly calculating the rkky interaction for the corresponding electron distribution in the conduction band : see appendix c. ) thermalization effects would further contribute to the demagnetization .    </S>",
    "<S> the key to understanding the initial _ increase _ of @xmath45 with @xmath7 [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](a ) ] is that in the low - doped eu@xmath0gd@xmath1o the carrier thermalization time @xmath46 is enhanced over the one in dense itinerant ferromagnets , like ni or gd . </S>",
    "<S> this is because charge thermalization occurs by electron - electron scattering whose rate is proportional to the carrier concentration . </S>",
    "<S> taking the carrier thermalization time in pure gd as @xmath47  fs @xcite , the @xmath29 ratio of @xmath48 lets us estimate @xmath46 in low - doped eu@xmath0gd@xmath1o to be @xmath49  ps . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the dynamics for the first few ps is dominated by a _ </S>",
    "<S> non - equilibrium _ charge carrier distribution , i.e. , the 3tm is not applicable . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , since electron - electron interactions are scarce in this time range , photoexcitation of the chemically doped carriers within the @xmath8 band into higher band states is kinematically forbidden . because of the large energy and the small momentum transferred by the photon , energy and momentum conservation can not simultaneously be fulfilled in this two - body process . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , resonant pumping of the @xmath24 transition can occur because it satisfies energy and momentum conservation [ fig  [ fig4](c ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> hence , for the first few ps after the photoexcitation , the carrier distribution is comprised of chemically doped carriers in the @xmath8 conduction band , which remain nearly unaffected by the pump pulse , and of the fraction of the @xmath9 electron population which is photo - excited into the state with @xmath10 electron character . </S>",
    "<S> all the mobile carriers contribute to a stronger magnetic coupling between the eu @xmath9 spins .    as an additional effect </S>",
    "<S> , the increase in the carrier density in the conduction band strengthens its interaction with the gd impurity band . as shown in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , this entails an energetic downshift of the conduction band toward the gd impurity band and , hence , a reduction of the @xmath9-@xmath8 gap energy @xmath50 . </S>",
