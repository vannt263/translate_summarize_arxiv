    "the ongoing interest in the field of classical waves in complex media is caused by the importance of detection and imaging techniques that are based on wave propagation and scattering .",
    "this ranges from electromagnetic waves in optical and near infrared tomography @xcite and microwave radars @xcite to acoustic waves in ultrasonics @xcite and geophysics @xcite .",
    "complexity is often associated with inhomogeneities that cause scattering which complicates most imaging processes considerably . however , when used cleverly , the scattered field can also be used to improve imaging @xcite .",
    "although length scales ( with respect to the wavelength ) and the degree of the disorder may vary considerably from field to field , methods and results have been shown to be interchangeable without much difficulty @xcite .",
    "recent topics of interest include localization of classical waves @xcite , the transition from ballistic to diffusive wave propagation @xcite , acoustic time - reversal imaging @xcite , etc .",
    "direct simulation by the exact solution of a well - known helmholtz wave equation for a given realization of the medium is often the method of choice for given applications .",
    "the drawbacks of the brute force computational approach are the limited system size and statistics that can be achieved with given computer resources as well as the difficulty to distill general principles out from the plethora of output data .",
    "the need for simple models with transparent results therefore remains .",
    "an analytic theory of wave propagation in disordered media necessarily relies on simple model scatterers , for which point scatterers , i.e. ( regularized ) @xmath0-functions in real space , are often chosen @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the scattering response of a single point scatterer can become non - causal , a pathological behavior that can not be solved by a simple momentum cutoff @xcite . especially for the study of the frequency dependence over a wider range it is therefore necessary to use more realistic model scatterers .    in this paper",
    "we wish to study a simple but not unrealistic experiment for the determination of the scattering properties of scalar waves in a disordered bulk material .",
    "a signal is emitted by a source and detected by a receiver , both embedded in the medium at sufficiently large distances from the boundaries .",
    "ultimately , we are interested in the detector signal caused by a pulsed ( broadband ) signal emitted by the source . after a first arrival",
    "we then expect the so - called coda that arrives at later times due to multiple scattering at the random scatterers @xcite .",
    "however , combining both the effects of multiple scattering and the full frequency dependence of the scattering processes renders an analytical treatment difficult without additional approximations , such as a complete neglect of the frequency dependence of the scattering amplitudes @xcite . in order to understand how to justify certain approximations and eventually find better ones , we have carried out a study of the frequency dependence of the scattering properties of random media .",
    "we concentrate on the steady state in the presence of strictly monochromatic sources , which distinguishes the present work from related studies of the propagation of narrow band pulses @xcite . as main results we obtain the frequency dependence of macroscopic effective medium properties like",
    "the mean free path and the diffusion constant that depend on the microscopic parameters of the random scatterers .",
    "when the ratio between source - receiver distance and mean free path is small , wave propagation is predominantly ballistic .",
    "when this ratio is large , energy and intensity propagation is governed by the diffusion equation @xcite . both these regimes are well understood . however ,",
    "many imaging applications operate on length scales where the mean free path and the source - receiver distance are comparable .",
    "this is especially the case in geophysics where mean free paths range from a few hundred meters up to tens of kilometers @xcite .",
    "the behavior at this crossover regime between ballistic and diffuse wave ( intensity ) propagation is of considerable interest @xcite and also subject of the present study .    here",
    "we present an analytical formalism on monochromatic wave intensity and energy propagation in one dimensional , two dimensional and three dimensional ( 1d , 2d and 3d ) homogeneously disordered media using realistic model scatterers .",
    "we determine the relative contributions of diffusively and coherently propagated waves as the source - receiver distance increases .",
    "we did no find many theoretical studies of wave propagation in two dimensional random media in the literature @xcite , although several experiments on quasi 2d systems have been carried out @xcite .",
    "another possible test for our 2d theory is comparison with numerical studies , which for very large systems are much cheaper than in the 3d case .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sections",
    "ii - iv we start with defining our model system and the basic equations , addressing the scattering matrices of single scatterers and discussing the average amplitude propagators in the frequency domain .",
    "the intensity , energy flux and energy density are discussed in section v. results on the frequency dependence of the diffusion constant and its dependence on the model parameters are discussed in section vi . in general , the results for 1d systems are easily obtained , whereas our results for 3d systems agree with findings previously reported by others .",
    "the mathematics in the 2d case is not trivial , however , and the derivations are summarized in the appendix .",
    "we end with the conclusions .",
    "we describe the propagation of ( scalar ) acoustic waves in a microscopic model system . specifically , we consider a 1d , 2d or 3d acoustic medium with wave velocity @xmath1 and a mass density @xmath2 .",

    "these observables contain a time independent contribution and a second term oscillating with frequency @xmath29 .",

    "it is interesting to see that , in contrast to the 3d case , in 1d and 2d the average flux depends on both the mean free path and the real part of the effective wave vector .",

    "in which the wave energy is not ( yet ) localized , the dependence on the arctangent should be observable .",
    "the total average intensity is proportional to the propagator @xmath116 , that can be obtained by calculating the fourier transform:@xmath117 @xmath118 is given by ( [ pi0k1d ] ) in 1d , ( [ pi0k2d ] ) in 2d and ( [ pi0k3d ] ) in the 3d case . in 1d and 2d",
    "this integral diverges because in the steady state case with a monochromatic source , energy does not escape fast enough to infinity due to the scatterers .",
    "this is analogous to the fact that the poisson equation ( the diffusion equation in steady state with source term ) for a line or planar source has no well - defined solution .",

    "is overestimated significantly ( up to @xmath139 ) when we approximate it by just the sum of coherent and totally diffusive  terms .",
    "in 3d the fourier transform ( [ ftint ] ) converges and the intensity is well - defined .",
    "we rewrite@xmath140 where@xmath141 we were not able to solve ( [ 3dcrointegral ] ) analytically as well . in the 3d case ,",
    "the intensity is a function of @xmath142 only ( it does not depend on @xmath143 ) .",
    "( [ pirw3dtot ] ) consists of three terms ( @xmath144 ) .",
    "the first term is proportional to the coherent intensity , the second term is the algebraically decaying diffuse term ( the only term that is not exponentially decaying ) .",
    "we plot the sum of the first and second term multiplied by @xmath145 ( in units of @xmath146 ) in figure ( [ fig3dint ] ) as a function of @xmath138 ( on the right axis ) .",
    "the third term is again the crossover correction to the total intensity if we approximate @xmath121 by only the first two terms .",
    "a plot of the crossover correction divided by the sum of the first two terms is shown in figure  ( [ fig3dint ] ) ( left axis ) .",
    "the crossover term vanishes for @xmath135 or @xmath136 and peaks at @xmath147 .",
    "it can thus be concluded that the intensity can very well be approximated by just the sum of coherently and totally diffusively propagated intensities , as the total intensity in 3d will never be overestimated by more than @xmath148 using this approximation .",

    "we observe that we can approximate the average intensity well by just the coherent and diffusive contributions .",
    "furthermore , we saw that already at @xmath137 the diffusive intensity is higher than the coherent intensity .",
    "this does not mean that when a pulsed source is used , we should see signs of the crossover to the diffusive regime at this point , because the diffuse peak is much broader than the coherent peak , so this crossover point is at larger values of @xmath155 , as was previously reported @xcite .",
    "obviously , our present model system has been assumed to be boundless . in a finite slab geometry boundary scattering , which is beyond the scope of this study ,",
    "would of course affect the results .      to derive a first - principles expression for the diffusion constant from fick s law ( [ fick1 ] )",

    "we define@xmath157 the fourier transform of @xmath158(@xmath159 ) diverges , which means that we can not use the same procedure as we used for the intensity and the flux .",
    "according to the bethe - salpeter equation@xmath160 this integral diverges as well because of the strong singularities in @xmath161 ( also when the gradient is calculated in the 2d  case ) .",
    "when averaging , scatterers are effectively moved around the medium and for every configuration the contribution to the total average response is calculated . however , because of the stronger singularities in @xmath161 ( remember that every scatterer becomes a new source of spherical waves ) this is not possible when the receiver position coincides with a scatterer position .",
    "the reason for this is the point receiver assumption and the far field scattering approximation .",
    "we can circumvent this problem by omitting a small volume / area around @xmath162 with radius of approximately one wavelength .",
    "this slightly modifies the probability distribution function form completely random  to non - overlapping  ( with the receiver ) in order to avoid the divergencies .",
    "we then find that @xmath163 is given by:@xmath164 in principle , our original expression for @xmath121 should now be multiplied by a factor @xmath165 , where @xmath166 is the radius of omission , so as long as the mean free path is longer then a few wavelengths omitting this small volume does not influence the results .",
    "furthermore , even if scattering is strong and the mean free path is of the order of the wavelength , this factor will not be of importance .",
    "the second term of eq .",
    "( [ avwing ] ) , the kinetic energy , can be split:@xmath167 now the condition that the scatterer position can not coincide with the receiver position ensures that the second term vanishes , due to the step function in the potential ( [ scatpot ] ) .",
    "we can thus just disregard this term .    in 1d",
    "it is straightforward to prove that@xmath168 always holds .",
    "we have to impose the condition the the receiver can not coincide with a scatterer to make sure that@xmath169 only under the restrictions mentioned here , the averaged energy density in 1d , 2d and 3d can be expressed as being proportional to the intensity:@xmath170 and this thus means that only the gradient of the energy density is well - defined in the 1d and 2d cases .",

    "we explicitly show that the total intensity is well approximated by the sum of the coherent and the fully developed diffuse wave field , for all source - receiver distances .",
    "energy transport and intensity propagation in 2d disordered systems shows interestingly different behavior compared to the 3d case : in 2d , the average energy flux depends on the mean free path and the effective transport velocity depends differently in terms of the scattering parameters .",
    "the ( gradient of the ) intensity as a function of the source - receiver distance , on the other hand , behaves similarly in the 2d and the 3d case .",
    "the monochromatic source enables us to investigate the frequency dependence due to finite size scatterers on the macroscopic diffusion constant . for a monodisperse distribution of scatterers shape resonances",
    "show up in the relevant frequency range for low internal scatterer velocities ( @xmath192 small ) . in this frequency range ( where scattering is expected to be isotropic ) the dependence of the scattering properties on frequency can not be neglected .",
    "this means that descriptions of broadband pulse propagation through these media should in principle incorporate both frequency dependent and multiple scattering effects .",
    "the development of a workable ward identity in this case remains a challenge , however .",
    "finally , we want point out that our model describes transport of scalar acoustic waves but results can be extended and many conclusions should also apply to vector wave fields random media .",
