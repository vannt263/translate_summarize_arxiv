    "summaries of measurements of @xmath3 from various processes and at different energy scales @xmath5 demonstrate @xcite that the energy dependence of @xmath3 is in good agreement with the prediction of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "high precision tests are provided by e@xmath0e@xmath1 annihilation data which were collected between some gev and nearly 200 gev .",
    "unfortunately , in the interesting intermediate energy region where @xmath3 runs very quickly , the `` best '' value of @xmath3 , 0.14 @xmath6 0.2  @xcite , is a combined result at @xmath4 35  gev based on measurements at petra that are affected by large theoretical uncertainties because only qcd predictions up to @xmath7 were available for event shape observables .",
    "significant progress has been made in perturbative qcd calculations since 1992 .",
    "observables have been proposed for which perturbative predictions are extended beyond the next - to - leading - order through the inclusion of leading and next - to - leading logarithms  @xcite which are summed to all orders of @xmath3 ( nlla ) .",
    "further , the precise measurements of the hadronisation process have improved the modelling of hadronic final states with monte carlo programs .",
    "it is desirable to apply these lep - established developments consistently to lower energy data in order to improve quantitative studies of the running of @xmath8 over large ranges of the energy scale @xmath5 , using identical experimental techniques and theoretical calculations in order to minimise point - to - point systematic uncertainties . in the following",
    ", @xmath9+nlla determinations of @xmath3 using data from the jade experiment at petra at @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 gev are presented @xcite .",
    "the jade detector  @xcite was one of the five experiments at the petra electron - positron accelerator .",
    "it has operated from 1979 until 1986 at centre - of - mass energies of @xmath13 to @xmath14 gev .",
    "the main components of the detector were the central jet chamber to measure charged particle tracks and the lead glass calorimeter to measure electromagnetic showers .",
    "multihadronic events were selected by the standard jade selection cuts  @xcite which reduce the background from @xmath15 and @xmath16-pair events to less than @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the final numbers of events which were retained for this analysis are listed in table  [ tab - eventnumbers ] , together with the corresponding integrated luminosities .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the physical results of previous publications by jade can be very well reproduced  @xcite .    monte carlo detector simulation corresponding to the jade data were retrieved for @xmath11 and @xmath12  gev .",
    "they were generated using the jetset qcd shower event generator version 6.3  @xcite .",
    "in general , there is good agreement of the detector simulation with data for all event shape distributions studied here .",
    "the simulated data can thus be used to correct for detector effects in the measured data .",
    "from the data samples , the event shape distributions of thrust @xmath19 , the heavy jet mass @xmath20 , the total and wide jet broadening @xmath21 and @xmath22 and the differential 2-jet event rate using the durham jet finder @xmath23 were determined(c.f .",
    "@xcite ) . for the latter three observables ,",
    "no experimental results have previously been presented at these energies .",
    "the event shape data were corrected for the limited acceptance and resolution of the detector and for initial state photon radiation effects by applying a bin - by - bin correction procedure .",
    "it turns out that there is an excellent agreement between the data and the model prediction at _ hadron level _ over the whole kinematic range of the observables even for those ones which were never tested at such low energies @xcite .",
    "no detector simulation were available for the @xmath24  gev data .",
    "therefore only the differential 2-jet rate was considered because it is known to depend to a lesser extend on detector effects .",
    "the 35  gev correction was applied to the 22  gev data since the correction factors for this observable were found to show no significant energy dependence  @xcite .    in a second step ,",
    "the data distributions were corrected for hadronisation effects by applying bin - by - bin correction factors derived from the ratio of the jetset generated distributions before and after hadronisation .",
    "the data distributions , thus corrected to the _ parton level _ , can be compared directly to analytic qcd calculations .",
    "the event shape observables used in the analysis are predicted in perturbative qcd by a combination of the @xmath9  @xcite and the nlla  @xcite calculations .",
    "the @xmath2 calculation yields an expression of the form @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the cumulative cross - section of an event shape observable @xmath27 normalised to the lowest order born cross - section @xmath28 .",

    "the functions @xmath32 and @xmath33 are given by the nlla calculations .",
    "the coefficients @xmath34 and @xmath35 are known from the @xmath2 matrix elements .",
    "the strong coupling @xmath3 was determined by @xmath36 fits to the event shape distributions corrected to the _ parton level_. for the sake of direct comparison with other published results this analysis closely followed the procedures described in @xcite .",
    "the so - called ln(@xmath37)-matching scheme was chosed to merge the @xmath38(@xmath39 ) with the nlla calculations",
    ". the renormalisation scale factor , @xmath40 @xmath41 , was set to @xmath42 for the main result .",
    "the fit ranges are determined by the requirements of moderate hadronisation uncertainties within the fit ranges , good @xmath43 and reasonably stable fits under changes of the range .      to study systematic uncertainties  @xcite details of the event selection and of the correction procedure were modified .",
    "the impact of the hadronisation model of the jetset generator was studied by varying several significant model parameters .",
    "mass effects are estimated conservatively by excluding the b - quark from the correction procedure .",
    "uncertainties due to contributions of unknown higher order corrections are estimated by the changes of @xmath3 when varying the renormalisation scale factor @xmath40 in the range of 0.5 to 2.0 . any resulting deviation from the main result",
    "was considered as systematic error .      as an example , the theoretical predictions for the observables @xmath44 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 at @xmath45 and @xmath23 at @xmath46 and 35  gev are presented in figures [ fig - asresult-1 ] - [ fig - asresult-3 ] and superimposed on the corresponding measured distributions corrected to _",
    "parton level_. in general , resummed calculations ( solid lines ) give a good description of the observables over their entire range of values even at the low petra energies , while the @xmath2 calculations ( dashed lines ) which are shown for comparison fail in describing the 2-jet region .",
    "the values of @xmath3 and the errors obtained at @xmath11 and @xmath12  gev are shown in figure  [ fig - asresult - numbers ] in comparison with the @xmath3 values measured by opal at @xmath47  @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath3 exhibit a similar scattering pattern at all energies .",
    "this demonstrates the strong correlation of the systematic uncertainties at jade and opal .",
    "the individual results of the five observables at each energy were combined  @xcite into a single value .",
    "the final results for @xmath3 are @xmath48 where the result at @xmath24  gev is based on @xmath23 only .",
    "the main contributions to the systematic errors come from renormalisation scale uncertainties and mass effects which causes systematically higher values for @xmath3 .",
    "jade data at @xmath4 @xmath24 , @xmath11 and @xmath12  gev were used to measure @xmath3 simultaneously with old ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) and new ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) event shape observables .",
    "the corresponding @xmath9+nlla predictions are in good agreement with the measured distributions corrected to parton level even at petra energies .",
    "it can be pointed out that the present measurements of @xmath3 are the most precise in this energy region of the e@xmath0e@xmath1 continuum .",
    "the individual results are _ consistent _ with each other .",
    "the errors are dominated by effects of missing higher orders in the qcd calculations .",
    "evolving the measurements to @xmath49 the results obtained at @xmath12 , @xmath11 and @xmath24  gev transform to a combined value of @xmath50 which is consistent with the direct measurement at @xmath51 by opal of @xmath52@xcite , for the same subset of observables .",
    "similarities between the main detector components of jade  @xcite and opal  @xcite , as well as between this analysis and studies performed by opal  @xcite at @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55  gev , allow for a precision test of the energy dependence of @xmath3 between @xmath10-@xmath55  gev .",
    "the @xmath3 from opal and from this analysis are shown in figure  [ fig - world - nlla - as ] .",
    "the result of a @xmath36 fit of the @xmath56 qcd prediction to the data is shown by the solid line corresponding to @xmath57 and @xmath43 = 4.9/5 , taking into account only statistical and experimental uncertainties .    a fit for the hypothesis @xmath58 const .",
    "gives a @xmath59 which has a vanishing probability .",
    "the energy dependence of @xmath3 is therefore significantly demonstrated by the results from the combined jade and opal data .",
