    "gas in the interstellar medium ( ism ) in disk galaxies can exist in a molecular , atomic or ionised phase .",
    "most of it will be in the form of neutral atomic hydrogen ( hi ) whose hyperfine transition can be detected at the 21-cm wavelength . since the early work of @xcite ,",
    "the neutral atomic ism has been known to exist in two phases , known as the cold neutral medium ( cnm ) and the warm neutral medium ( wnm ) .",
    "@xcite first suggested that hi seen in emission and absorption had different line widths because it arose from two distinct components of the ism .",
    "the narrow absorption spectra are caused by a cold component of the ism ( the cnm ) with a temperature of @xmath4 whereas the broad emission spectra arose from a warm component with a temperature as high as @xmath5 ( the wnm ) .",
    "the existence of these two components was later confirmed by @xcite using interferometric observations of hi emission and absorption spectra towards 35 extragalactic sources situated at intermediate and high galactic latitude .",
    "the cnm and the wnm are known to coexist in pressure equilibrium over a narrow range of pressure @xcite .",
    "the cnm dominates at high densities and pressures whereas the wnm prevails at low densities and pressures .",
    "these two components have been identified in the milky way , in nearby dwarfs , and spiral galaxies by comparing hi seen in emission and absorption as well as from observations of hi emission alone .",
    "@xcite and @xcite analyzed hi emission velocity profiles of seven nearby dwarf galaxies . by fitting these profiles with gaussian components , they found evidence for a broad component with a dispersion ranging from about 8 to 13 @xmath1 as well as a much narrower component with a dispersion ranging from 3 to 5 @xmath1 .",
    "these velocity dispersions are larger than the predicted thermal line widths for the cnm and the wnm , showing that other energy sources are also playing role in broadening the line profiles .",
    "moreover , they found that the narrow component shows a clumpy distribution and tends to be located near star formation regions , whereas the broad component shows a more ubiquitous distribution . because of the similarities of the observed properties of these two components with those of the cnm and wnm in m 31 and in our galaxy , they associated the narrow component with the cnm and the broad component with the wnm phases of the ism .",
    "a similar study was made by @xcite for the local group dwarf galaxy ngc 6822 .",
    "they also found narrow and broad hi components with mean velocity dispersions of 4 @xmath1 and 8 @xmath1 , respectively . here also , the narrow component is usually located near star forming regions , whereas the broad component tends to be found along every line of sight .",
    "@xcite analyzed hi emission of 11 nearby spiral galaxies and found what he called a high brightness filamentary network ( hbn ) of hi emission which he associated with the cnm and a diffuse low brightness emission which he identified with the wnm .",
    "the hbn dominates inside the optical radius @xmath6 where it accounts for 60 - 90 % of the hi emission , whereas the diffuse component dominates outside this radius . by averaging spectra with peak brightness temperature higher than 4@xmath7 within annular ellipses in his sample",
    ", he found that the combined spectra were characterized by a narrow core superposed on broad lorentzian wings .",
    "the width of the narrow line cores allowed @xcite to give an upper limit of 300 k for the hbn .",
    "@xcite also found that the kinetic temperature of the hbn increases with increasing radius .",
    "@xcite interpreted this as a result of the decrease in the mid - plane thermal pressure towards the outer disks .",
    "understanding the properties of the gas in the ism is crucial as it is the fuel for star formation .",
    "most of this star formation occurs in giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) .",
    "these are self gravitating clouds with masses @xmath8 and sizes @xmath9 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "hydrogen molecules ( @xmath10 ) are the main constituents of gmcs , but unfortunately @xmath10 is not easily observable .",
    "carbon monoxide ( co ) is the second most abundant molecule in gmcs and can be detected at millimeter wavelengths .",
    "typically , co line emission is used to infer the amount and distribution of @xmath10 in galaxies using some co - to-@xmath10 conversion factor ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the strength of the co emission depends on the metallicity of the ism @xcite and it is therefore difficult to detect in low metallicity dwarf galaxies .",
    "an alternative approach is thus necessary to investigate the distribution of @xmath10 there .",
    "one example of this is to use the dust emission at infrared wavelengths as a tracer of the molecular gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . another approach , which will be the topic of this paper , is to try and identify a precursor of the molecular gas .",
    "if the h@xmath11 component forms from the cooling of the cnm , then identifying the cnm in galaxies can yield independent information on the properties of a component of the gas that is closely linked to star formation .    in this paper",
    ", we attempt to detect the cnm and wnm components of the ism by analyzing the shapes of stacked hi emission profiles of galaxies observed as part of the hi nearby galaxies survey ( things , * ? ? ?",
    "things is a large survey of 34 nearby spiral and dwarf galaxies performed with the nrao very large array ( vla ) .",
    "the purpose of things was to obtain high spectral and spatial resolution maps of the neutral hydrogen in these galaxies .",
    "the things galaxies have distances between 2 and 15 @xmath12 , star formation rates of @xmath13 to @xmath14 , absolute @xmath15-luminosities of @xmath16 to @xmath17 mag , total hi masses of ( 0.0114 ) @xmath18 , and metallicities of 7.5 to 9.2 in units of [ 12 + log(o / h ) ] . using the vla b , c and d arrays ,",
    "the things targets were observed at a spatial resolution of @xmath19 ( robust weighting ) or @xmath20 ( natural weighting ) , respectively .",
    "two of the things galaxies were observed at a spectral resolution of 1.3 @xmath1 and the rest at a resolution of either 2.6 or 5.2 @xmath1 ( see table 2 of @xcite ) .",
    "we use the natural - weighted ( and non - residual scaled ) cubes in this paper , though our results are independent of the weighting scheme used .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for an explanation on how the data cubes were produced .",
    "we use the task pbcorr in the groningen image processing system ( gipsy ) to correct for the effect of the primary beam of the telescope in the image cubes .",
    "the publicly available things moment maps already are corrected for primary beam attenuation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [",
    "sec : method ] , we describe the principles of our method for obtaining high signal - to - noise ( s / n ) stacked profiles .",
    "section [ sec : fitting ] describes the fitting and decomposition of the profiles . in section [ sec : sys_effects ] , we discuss various effects that may influence the shapes of the profiles . in section",
    "[ sec : cleansample ] , we describe how we define a clean sample based on the studies of these effects . in section [ sub : asymm_effect ] , we check the reliability of the profile shapes of the clean sample . in section [ sec : globaltrend ] , we check possible correlations between the shapes of the profiles and properties of galaxies or morphology . in section [ sec : moleculargas ] , we investigate whether the narrow component is associated with molecular gas .",
    "we summarize our results in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "individual velocity profiles in typical hi observations generally have a low ( @xmath21 ) to moderate ( @xmath22 ) s / n . in the things observations , fitting individual , separate profiles in a data cube needs to be done carefully to avoid skewed results due to the effects of noise . here",
    ", we use a method analogous to the _ stacking _ method sometimes used in high - redshift hi observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to construct high s / n profiles .",
    "note that we stack individual spectra within galaxies rather than combining global galaxy spectra .",
    "since individual profiles located at different positions in a galaxy have different radial velocities , the profiles can not be summed as they are , but need to be shifted in velocity to the same reference velocity .",
    "we use the gipsy task shuffle to do this .",
    "this task uses a velocity field to define the amount by which a profile in the corresponding data cube needs to be shifted .",
    "we use gauss - hermite @xmath23 polynomial velocity fields as input for shuffle .",
    "gauss hermite polynomial velocity fields give robust estimates for the radial velocity of the peak of the profile , even in the presence of profile asymmetries . for an extensive description see @xcite .    to minimize the effects of noise ,",
    "we only include individual profiles whose peak fluxes exceed the 3@xmath7 noise level in the data cubes .",
    "for each galaxy , we sum the shuffled profiles to produce what we call _ super profiles_. these are high quality profiles , which due to their increased s / n allow us to reliably explore the presence of the cold and warm neutral components of the ism .",
    "however , as information on the individual profiles is lost during the stacking , care needs to be taken that systematic effects and possible asymmetries in the input profiles are quantified , to prevent these from mimicking the presence of multiple components in the super profiles .",
    "this is discussed in detail in section [ sub : asymm_effect ] .",
    "we show in figure [ fig : superpro_ex ] examples of the super profiles of three galaxies ( one quiescent galaxy : ddo154 , one starburst galaxy : ngc 1569 , and an interacting galaxy : ngc 5194 ; the rest are shown in appendix a ) .",
    "these super profiles are summed over the entire hi disks of the galaxies using the 3@xmath7 cut - off mentioned previously .",
    "typically , each super profile is the sum of a few hundred to a few thousand independent individual profiles ( see table [ tab : table_superpro ] ) .",
    "we also plot @xmath24 uncertainties ( as defined in section [ sec : fitting ] ) , though in many cases these are smaller than the symbols used to plot the profiles .",
    "the super profiles are characterized by broader wings and narrower peaks than purely gaussian profiles .",
    "most of the super profiles are symmetrical .",
    "these properties are all similar to what was found for the individual profiles of seven nearby dwarf galaxies studied by @xcite and @xcite , but observed at a much higher s / n ."
