    "a `` @xmath8 process '' was postulated to produce 35 stable but rare isotopes between @xmath10se and @xmath11hg on the proton - rich side of the valley of stability . unlike the remaining 99% of the heavy elements beyond iron these isotopes can not be created by ( slow or rapid ) neutron captures @xcite , and their solar and isotopic abundances are 1 - 2 orders of magnitude lower than the respective @xmath12- and @xmath13-process nuclei @xcite .",
    "however , so far it seems to be impossible to reproduce the solar abundances of all @xmath8 isotopes by one single process . in current understanding ,",
    "several ( independently operating ) processes seem to contribute .",
    "the largest fraction of @xmath8 isotopes is created in the `` @xmath14 process '' by sequences of photodissociations and @xmath15 decays @xcite .",
    "this occurs in explosive o / ne burning during snii explosions and reproduces the solar abundances for the bulk of @xmath8 isotopes within a factor of @xmath163 @xcite .",
    "the sn shock wave induces temperatures of 2 - 3 gk in the outer ( c , ne , o ) layers , sufficient for triggering the required photodisintegrations .",
    "more massive stellar models ( m@xmath1720  m@xmath18 ) seem to reach the required temperatures for efficient photodisintegration already at the end of hydrostatic o / ne burning @xcite .",
    "historically , the @xmath8 process was thought to proceed via proton captures but today they are found to play no role since the required amount of free protons is not available in the ne and o layers within the @xmath8-process timescale of a few seconds and proton captures are too slow for elements with large @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , the term `` @xmath14 process '' is also often used synonymously because seed nuclei pre - existing in the stellar plasma are photodissociated and more proton - rich isotopes are produced , initially by @xmath20 reactions .",
    "when ( @xmath21 ) and ( @xmath22 ) reactions become comparable or faster than neutron emission within an isotopic chain , the reaction path branches out and feeds nuclei with lower charge number @xmath19 .",
    "the decrease in temperature after passage of the shock leads to a freeze - out via neutron captures and mainly @xmath15 decays , resulting in the typical @xmath8-process abundance pattern with maxima at @xmath0mo ( @xmath23=50 ) and @xmath24sm ( @xmath23=82 ) .",
    "however , the @xmath14-process scenario suffers from a strong underproduction of the most abundant @xmath8 isotopes , @xmath9mo and @xmath25ru , due to lack of seed nuclei with @xmath26@xmath2790 . for these missing abundances , alternative processes and sites",
    "have been proposed , either related to strong neutrino fluxes in the deepest ejected layers of a snii ( @xmath28 process @xcite ) , or rapid proton - captures in proton - rich , hot matter accreted on the surface of a neutron star ( @xmath29 process @xcite ) .",
    "modern , self - consistent studies of the @xmath14 process have problems to synthesize @xmath8 nuclei in the regions @xmath30 and @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "it is not yet clear whether the observed underproductions are only due to a problem with astrophysical models or also with the nuclear physics input , i.e. the reaction rates used .",
    "thus , the reduction of uncertainties in nuclear data is strictly necessary for a consistent understanding of the @xmath8 process .",
    "experimental data can improve the situation in two ways , either by directly replacing predictions with measured cross sections in the relevant energy range or by testing the reliability of predictions at other energies when the relevant energy range is not experimentally accessible .",
    "accordingly , model calculations of the @xmath8 process require large nuclear reaction networks involving about 1800 isotopes and more than ten thousand reaction rates . since the largest fraction of such a network contains proton - rich , unstable isotopes , which are not accessible for cross section measurements with present experimental techniques , almost all of these rates have to be determined theoretically by means of the statistical hauser - feshbach ( hf ) formalism @xcite .",
    "hence , there is no alternative to employing statistical model calculations , e.g. those performed with the codes non - smoker @xcite or most @xcite .",
    "comparison with experimental results has shown that theoretical hf predictions with global parameter sets reproduce the neutron- and proton - induced cross sections within a factor of two or even better .",
    "this deviation increases for @xmath32-induced reactions .",
    "it has been noted that the difficulties in calculating these rates are due to the poor knowledge of the @xmath32-optical potential at astrophysically relevant energies @xcite .",
    "the optical potential governs the transmission coefficient in the hf model .",
    "additional input to this model are nuclear level densities and particle separation energies .",
    "the latter data are well defined since nuclear masses in the @xmath8-process network are experimentally known .",
    "it is only one decade ago that charged particle - induced reaction rates at @xmath8-process energies ( @xmath33@xmath161 - 10  mev , @xmath34@xmath165 - 15  mev ) became subject of experimental efforts ( for a list of reactions , see @xcite ) .",
    "for example , a series of @xmath32-scattering experiments at energies below the coulomb barrier helped to improve the optical @xmath32-nucleus potential @xcite . however , firm conclusions are still difficult to draw due to the lack of experimental cross sections .",
    "nevertheless , extrapolations to the low astrophysical energies remain necessary since the coulomb barrier hampers scattering experiments in the astrophysically relevant energy range . scattering data within a confined energy range can be described equally well by different optical potentials with different extrapolation behavior .",
    "this ambiguity , which is called the family problem , makes extrapolations very uncertain @xcite .",
    "these uncertainties can be avoided if experimental cross sections are available for comparison with hf predictions in or close to the astrophysical gamow window .    up to now only five @xmath35 measurements with relevance for the @xmath8 process",
    "were performed within the gamow window between 5 and 15  mev : @xmath36ge @xcite , @xmath37ru @xcite , @xmath38cd @xcite , @xmath5sn @xcite , and @xmath24sm @xcite . with exception of the latter , the first four experiments agree within a factor of three with the non - smoker prediction using a global parameter set with the mcfadden - satchler @xmath32 potential @xcite .",
    "for the @xmath39 particle - exchange reactions a much larger amount of data exists , but almost all of these measurements are restricted to the upper end of the gamow window .",
    "it was noted in @xcite that especially in the heavy mass region ( beyond @xmath23=82 ) the knowledge of @xmath40 cross sections is crucial , whereas at lower masses the @xmath8-induced reactions have more importance .",
    "however , measurements of @xmath32-induced reactions are mainly limited ",
    "apart from some exceptions for @xmath39 cross sections  to the lower mass region below @xmath24sm . in an attempt to constrain the @xmath32+nucleus optical potential at low energy",
    ", it has been suggested to use ( @xmath41 ) reactions and some reactions around @xmath42 have been studied in this way @xcite .    finally , it has to be emphasized that with a few exceptions ( @xmath43 ) and ( @xmath44 ) data in the relevant energy range are more useful for a direct application in reaction networks than ( @xmath22 ) or ( @xmath21 ) data despite of the fact that the @xmath8 process proceeds via photodisintegration reactions .",
    "this may seem puzzling at first sight but has two reasons .",
    "first , reactions in the stellar plasma involve thermally excited targets and not only targets in the ground state as in the laboratory .",
    "measured rates have to be corrected for this effect .",
    "it can be shown that the thermal effects are much more pronounced in the photodisintegration than in the capture channel .",
    "thus the measured rate is closer to the actual rate when considering capture reactions .",
    "the reverse rate can then be derived applying detailed balance .",
    "second , in order to avoid inconsistencies , forward and reverse rates for a given reaction in a reaction network have to stem from the same source , related to each other by detailed balance . because of the exponential factor @xmath45 in the expression for the relation of reverse to forward rate ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , it is preferrable to have data for the direction of positive @xmath46 value to limit numerical errors in the simulation . in most cases",
    "this is the capture direction , exclusively in the case of proton captures close to stability .",
    "however , in the intermediate to heavy mass region the @xmath8 process also includes @xmath32 emitters with negative @xmath32 capture @xmath46 values .    in this work we study ( @xmath1 ) reactions on light mo isotopes and @xmath32",
    "capture on @xmath5sn , motivated by the need to better understand the above described deficiencies in the @xmath8 process models .",
    "previous investigations of astrophysical relevance were restricted to @xmath32 scattering on @xmath0mo @xcite , @xmath38cd @xcite , and on @xmath5sn @xcite attempting to derive an improved optical potential for these cases .",
    "the experimental setup for the measurement of @xmath32-induced cross sections is described in sec .",
    "the resulting cross sections and a comparison with previous experimental results for @xmath0mo(@xmath1)@xmath2ru , @xmath3mo(@xmath1)@xmath4ru , and @xmath5sn(@xmath6)@xmath7te are given in sec .",

    "all cross section measurements have been carried out at the cyclotron of the physikalisch - technische bundesanstalt ( ptb ) in braunschweig/ germany @xcite with the activation technique by irradiation of thin sample layers and subsequent counting of the induced activity .",
    "a detailed description of the measurement technique and the data analysis can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the sample material was deposited on 0.4  mm thick ta backings , which were thick enough to stop the @xmath32-beam completely to ensure a reliable charge collection .",
    "background reactions are efficiently suppressed by the high coulomb barrier of ta because @xmath32 capture on @xmath47ta leads to the stable product nucleus @xmath48re .",
    "the @xmath47ta@xmath39@xmath49re channel opens at 9.86  mev but does not interfere with our measurements .",
    "the contribution from the extremely rare isotope @xmath50ta@xmath51 ( natural elemental abundance 0.012% @xcite ) could be neglected .",
    "the mo samples were produced by sputtering natural metallic mo in a pure ar atmosphere .",
    "these samples were 10 mm in diameter and exhibited an area density between 5@xmath5210@xmath53 and 3@xmath5210@xmath54 mo atoms/@xmath55 , corresponding to layer thicknesses between 100  nm and 600  nm . the @xmath5sn samples were prepared from 10 mg of enriched metal powder containing 98.9% of @xmath5sn .",
    "this batch was dissolved in 30% hydrochloric acid and diluted with 90% acetone .",
    "the solution was then deposited on the ta backings , where uniform sncl@xmath56 layers with an area density between 6.2 and 9.8@xmath5210@xmath53 sn atoms/@xmath55 ( layer thicknesses @xmath16300 - 450  nm ) were obtained after evaporation of the acetone .",
    "the adhesion of the layers was improved by soft sand - blasting of the ta backings before the deposition .",
    "the masses of the mo and sn samples were determined by x - ray fluorescence analysis using a crystal spectrometer ( siemens srs 3000 ) , which was operated with a lif ( 100 ) crystal and a rhodium anode .",
    "the fluorescence yield was measured with a gas counter and a nai detector .",
    "the efficiency of the spectrometer was calibrated by the radiation emitted from an empty backing and by nine well defined mo and sn reference samples .",
    "the latter were prepared from standard solutions of ( nh@xmath57)@xmath56moo@xmath57 and sncl@xmath56 , respectively .",
    "the sample mass was derived from the measured k@xmath58 and k@xmath59 x - ray lines . in case of the sn sample an additional ta diaphragm",
    "10 mm in diameter was placed on top of the sample to restrict the measurement exactly to the area covered in the irradiations with the @xmath32 beam .",
    "while the statistical uncertainties were smaller than 0.3% , the definition of the sample mass was affected by systematic uncertainties of 4.0% and 4.6% for the mo and the sn samples , respectively .",

    "[ fig : ptb ] .",

    "[ eq : eff ] the error bars of @xmath62 become asymmetric , with the smaller component in positive direction due to the correction factor in brackets ( see tables [ tab:92 ] , [ tab:94 ] , and [ tab:112 ] ) .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the present experimental @xmath68 factors were compared to non - smoker hauser - feshbach calculations employing different optical @xmath32+nucleus potentials while keeping the standard inputs for the other parameters .",

    "the averaged neutron widths are smaller than the @xmath32 widths and therefore the sensitivity is higher to the neutron widths close to the threshold . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : potcomp-9294 ] , the theoretical results obtained with the different optical potentials display the same energy behavior but with different absolute values .",
    "this energy dependence describes that of the data reasonably well .",
    "the @xmath68 factors obtained with the mcfadden and satchler potential have to be divided by 1.8 , whereas the ones obtained with the frhlich potential are a factor of 1.8 too low .",
    "all other potentials used lead to larger deviations .",
    "an optical potential for @xmath0mo+@xmath32 was derived from scattering data and carefully extrapolated to low energy in ref .",

    "results at the low energy range shown here , whereas they coincide with the mcfadden and satchler @xmath68 factors at the high end of the energy range .",
    "thus , its energy dependence is slightly different from that of the other potentials and the data .",
    "also the reaction @xmath3mo@xmath39@xmath4ru is almost exclusively sensitive to the @xmath32 widths and shows only a small dependence on the neutron widths , except close to the threshold .",
    "inspection of fig .",
    "[ fig : potcomp-9294 ] evidently shows that the energy dependence of the data can not be reproduced by any of the potentials tried here .",
    "the peak @xmath68 factor is shifted to higher energy in the data as compared to the one found in the calculated @xmath68 factor .",
    "the cause of this remains unclear .",
    "the importance of the neutron widths does not extend beyond a few tens of kev above the ( @xmath32,n ) threshold .",
    "the impact of width fluctuation corrections is also confined to a small window above the reaction threshold .",
    "similar to the case above , multiplication of the results obtained with the frhlich potential with a factor 1.8 and division of the ones obtained with the mcfadden and satchler potential by 1.7 lead to an improved reproduction of the data .",
    "however , because of the distinctly different energy dependence none of these solutions are satisfactory .",
    "it may be surprising at first glance that the @xmath68 factors of the reaction @xmath5sn@xmath35@xmath7te are much more sensitive to the @xmath32 widths than to the @xmath14 widths .",
    "however , due to the coulomb barrier , the @xmath32 widths are smaller by one to several orders of magnitude than the @xmath14 widths in the energy range covered in the measurement .",
    "there are two data sets available , the one obtained in this work and the one by zkan et al",
    "both of them are compared to theoretical results in fig .",
    "[ fig : potcomp-112 ] . concerning the theoretical predictions using different optical @xmath32 potentials it is not surprising that the zkan et al .",
    "data at the high energy range are best described employing the potential i of demetriou et al .",
    "a preliminary version of these data was part of the procedure to derive the demetriou et al .",
    "potential , a global potential for heavy targets .",
    "similar agreement was already found in a study of @xmath32 scattering on @xmath5sn @xcite . in that study ,",

    ". we do not show the result with the optical potential derived in @xcite separately because it basically coincides with the one obtained with the mcfadden and satchler potential .",
    "interestingly , our new experimental data seem to indicate a slightly steeper energy dependence than the zkan data .",
    "this yields good agreement ( within the error bars ) with the prediction making use of the frhlich - rauscher potential ( with exception of the data point at 10.615  mev ) .",
    "the calculation using the demetriou potential @xcite exceeds our data ( including error bar ) at the three highest energies and is compatible to our data only at the two lowest energies .",
    "comparing to the zkan et al .",
    "data , the frhlich - rauscher potential gives acceptable agreement only below 9.5 mev and underestimates the @xmath68 factors above that energy . on the other hand , the demetriou et al .",
    "potential excellently reproduces the zkan et al .",
    "data above 8.5 mev but strongly overestimates them below that energy .",
