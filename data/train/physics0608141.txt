    "one of the main goals of epidemiological modeling is to provide guidelines for controlling disease outbreaks .",
    "traditionally this has been understood in terms of reducing the number of infected individuals . with a cheap vaccination available , ` blind ' vaccination of a large proportion of individuals",
    "might be a simple and yet optimal solution @xcite .",
    "however , in many cases the epidemic must be stopped at a manageable cost and with potentially limited resources , leading to a mixture of preventive and responsive measures . in the simplest case the goal of a successful prevention and eradication programme is to minimize a number of individuals who have either been treated or have been through the infection .    in a series of previous papers @xcite",
    "we have studied the suitability of local control strategies for stopping spread of diseases on networks with a mixture of local and global links .",
    "these include ` small - world ' networks @xcite , with a majority of contacts between nearest neighbors and a small number of global links . by a local strategy",
    "we understand control measures limited to some neighborhood of an infected individual .",
    "we have proposed a strategy that is a mixture of responsive and preventive actions .",
    "a control event is triggered by an appearance of a symptomatic individual ( responsive measure ) and spans not only this individual but also its immediate neighbors on a certain control network ( preventive measure ) .",
    "the preventive control ( analogous to a ring - vaccination strategy ) is necessary because of the delay between the onset of infectiousness of an individual and the onset of symptoms .",
    "thus , there is a possibility of pre - symptomatic yet infectious individuals to be located in the neighborhood of the observed disease case .",
    "the preventive local control strategy attempts to treat such potential cases .",
    "the crucial assumption in our paper is that the network that defines the control neighborhood is only a subset of the network on which the disease spreads and in particular contains only a number of long - range links .",
    "this reflects the limited ability of medical authorities to track and follow contacts between individuals leading to spread of the disease .",
    "in particular , we ask the following question : how detailed should our knowledge be of the network structure to be able to stop the disease at the lowest possible cost ?",
    "we compare different strategies by looking at the final size of the epidemics including individuals who have been through the disease as well as those treated @xcite .",
    "we also include an additional cost associated with tracking long - range links .",
    "the model of epidemic spread and the associated control must take into account the topology of the network on which the epidemic spreads , the topology of the sub - network which is used for control , the state of each individual and transitions between different states .",
    "we consider two basic topological structures , a 1-dimensional small world topology ( sw1d ) @xcite and 2-dimensional small world topology ( sw2d ) .",
    "the disease spreads on the full network , including local and global links .",
    "the control measures can only follow a subset of those links and in particular for the sw1d and sw2d topologies we assume that the subset contains all local links and a number of additional shortcuts .",
    "this approach is caused by the fact that it is much easier to track local interactions , interactions with surrounding individuals , fields and farms , than long - range interactions , which might be caused by geographical , technical , cultural or economical factors .",
    "the epidemiological part of the model is based on an sir model @xcite modified so that it includes pre- and post - symptomatic individuals ( who can both contribute to the spread of the infection ) and recovered as well as treated individuals .",
    "sw2d topology is constructed from a regular lattice , with periodic boundary conditions , to which a given number of additional random shortcuts is added .",
    "thus , every individual placed on the sw2d topology interacts with its four nearest neighbors and some other individuals via additional shortcuts ( fig .",
    "[ model - topology ] ) .",
    "the sw1d topology is constructed in a similar way , by adding long - range links to a one - dimensional ring . for compatibility between sw2d and sw1d topology every node of the initial ring",
    "has 4 first order neighbors , 2 of them located on the left hand side and 2 on the right hand side of the given node .    in the first instance",
    ", the control network contains the regular ( local ) part of the infection network .",
    "in addition , we assume that a certain number of long - range links is included in the control network .",
    "this reflects an additional effort that a government or health quthority put into disease tracking .",
    "a control neighborhood of given order , @xmath0 , is constructed in an iterative way .",
    "starting from the infected node the first order control neighbors are localized .",
    "the second order neighbors are then found as first order neighbors of the previous group .",
    "the whole procedure is repeated iteratively @xmath0 times .",
    "a single control action involves all individuals in the control neighborhood of order @xmath0 .",
    "individuals are placed on a given topology and can be in one of the following states :    1 .",
    "@xmath1  susceptible ( or healthy ) , which can be infected with probability @xmath2 by any infectious or detected individual in its epidemic neighborhood ; 2 .",
    "@xmath3  infectious ( infected but pre - symptomatic ) ; can infect other nodes from its epidemic neighborhood but can not trigger a control measure .",
    "in addition , with probability @xmath4 it can spontaneously move to the detected class , i.e. symptoms become observable ; 3 .",
    "@xmath5  detected ( infected and symptomatic ) , can infect other nodes from its epidemic spread neighborhood .",
    "in addition , it can spontaneously move to the recovered class ( with the probability @xmath6 ) or can trigger a treatment measure with the probability @xmath7 that includes all individuals within its control neighborhood ; 4 .",
    "@xmath8  recovered .",
    "this class includes individuals that have been through the disease , can be treated but can not become re - infected ; 5 .",
    "@xmath9  vaccinated ( treated ) . individuals in this class have been in a control neighborhood of a detected individual when the treatment event was triggered .",
    "they can not become re - infected .",
    "we assume that all nodes in the network are occupied .",
    "the initial state is a mixture of a majority of susceptible individuals with an addition of few ( @xmath10 or @xmath11 ) infectious ( symptomatic ) individuals .",
    "we denote the total number of nodes by @xmath12 and the number of susceptible nodes by @xmath13 , infected by @xmath14 , detected by @xmath15 , recovered by @xmath16 and treated ( vaccinated ) by @xmath17 .",
    "details of the simulations are given in @xcite .",
    "the model was updated synchronously and the simulation loop was performed until the number of infected individuals was equal to zero , i.e. until @xmath18 such that @xmath19 . in every iteration , spontaneous transitions from @xmath20 , @xmath21 and state - dependent transitions @xmath22 , @xmath23 were performed .",
    "we consider three treatment strategies , random vaccination , local vaccination and a mixed strategy combining local vaccination with tracking of long - range links . in the random ` blind ' vaccination , the given ratio of randomly chosen individuals is vaccinated shortly after the first detection of the disease . for local treatment all individuals up to a given order @xmath0 surrounding and including the detected infected individual , are vaccinated regardless of their current disease status . for the mixed strategy ,",
    "a certain proportion of long - range links is also tracked and individuals to which the detected individual is linked are treated as well .    for a given set of parameters the simulation was averaged over 50 realizations for the total number of nodes equal to 2500 ( i.e. the sw2d topology is created from the square @xmath24 lattice ) , with or without addition of a fixed number of 1023 long - range links .",
    "larger sizes of the networks and larger number of realizations were explored as well , but they did not improve or change the results .",
    "simulation results were analyzed to extract information that is relevant for the design of an optimal control strategy . in particular , we look at a severity index , a combined number of treated and recovered individuals , @xmath25 at the end of an epidemic .",
    "this quantity represents the combined severity of an untreated epidemic , @xmath26 , and the costs of treating it , @xmath27 . in this paper",

    "designing control strategies for networks incorporating long - range links is complicated . in the simplest case",
    ", we envisage treating infected and/or susceptible individuals so that the disease progress is slowed down or even stopped .",
    "examples of such treatment include preventive vaccination , culling of animals and quarantine of fields or individuals . for networks with only short - range interactions the spread of a disease is geographically limited and can therefore be contained locally @xcite . for non - local networks there is always a possibility of infection jumping to another location to form a new focus . in designing control strategies for such networks",
    "it is necessary to know not only the geographical location of new cases ( so that they and their immediate neighbors can be treated ) but also all possible connections that can span the whole population .",
    "obtaining this information can be very expensive and time consuming . with the authorities faced by a large - scale epidemic",
    "the collection of such data might be difficult and might lead to many inappropriate decisions .",
    "it is thus imperative to use epidemiological models to explore the possibilities of simplifying the control strategies .",
    "most models of disease spread used to predict its advance and to design efficient control measures assume a perfect knowledge of both the status of each individual ( healthy vs. infectious ) and the network structure ( who acquires the disease from whom @xcite ) . among the epidemiological parameters , the difference between the onset of infectiousness and the earliest detectability of the disease is the key issue for controlling the disease . for most diseases",
    "an individual can be infectious even though the infection can not be detected and controlled .",
    "such an individual can be a source of further infections for a relatively long time until the source is identified and controlled by isolation or treatment .",
    "in many cases , even post - symptomatic individuals can not be treated straight after the detection , which further adds to a spread of the epidemic .",
    "control strategies should aim at decreasing the time until control measures are applied by increasing detectability and speeding up control .",
    "we have shown that long - range links dramatically reduce the effectiveness of local control measures .",
    "our results show that in some cases it is possible to control epidemics with only limited knowledge about interactions between individuals .",
    "if this is not possible , our model gives guidance on conditions under which it is advisable to attempt to track long - range links , despite the high costs associated with such a strategy . from the economic point of view",
    ", contact tracking is important when disease incubation time is short and vaccination is efficient .",
    "furthermore , if the epidemics is highly infectious , knowledge oriented strategies lead to a significant decrease in the severity index characterizing the costs of disease eradication .",
    "there is a clear distinction between the case when the control measure works and when it does not .",
    "if the control neighborhood is too small , or we track insufficient numbers of long - range links , the disease keeps escaping the treatment and as a result we need to treat practically the whole population .",
    "making the ring of control even a fraction larger might lead to a dramatic increase in the efficiency of the control strategy .",
    "similarly , incorporating more long - range links might improve the effectiveness of the control measures .",
