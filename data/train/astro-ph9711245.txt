    "this meeting featured observations of the two optical transients ( ots ) associated with gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) so far .",
    "these important observations have produced some controversial results ( see presentations by caraveo , lamb , and fruchter ) , and they have not yet yielded either explanations of the physics of the bursts or an identification of the bursting object(s ) . an obvious next step is to find and study a _",
    "sample _ of ots , not just two examples as we have now .",
    "observations of @xmath310 or more ots are needed to address the controversies and give a statistical basis to host galaxy incidence and other properties .",
    "we have begun to use the wide - field ( @xmath0 ) automated patrol telescope ( apt ) to image grb positions for the identification of grb - associated ots .",
    "the telescope , located at siding spring observatory in australia , is fully dedicated to this project .",
    "the wide field is essential to search the large grb localizations from batse , the majority of all grb localizations . in one mode of operation ,",
    "we will study delayed emission similar to the ots already discovered . in a second mode of operation , we will search for prompt optical emission , actually during or shortly after gamma - ray emission .",
    "our telescope performs a regular observing program unless a grb alert is received .",
    "the gamma - ray coordinates network ( gcn ) sends out alerts 1 - 3 sec . after a batse grb reaches threshold",
    "; these alerts reach our site via the internet in 200 - 400 msec .",
    "the apt then interrupts its observations , slews to the grb position , and begins integration . *",
    "1 ) prompt emission search : * because the apt can make long slews in @xmath4 20 sec .",
    ", we can make optical observations during the tail end of @xmath2-ray emission for many grbs .",
    "figure 1 shows that more than 47% of all bursts are longer than our 20 sec .",
    "slew time .",
    "shorter bursts would still be observed less than 20 sec .",
    "after @xmath2 emission .    after the initial slew , a series of exposures of 10 , 20 , 40 , ... sec .",
    "are taken to sample different time scales up to @xmath32 hrs .",
    "our ccd can be read in 6 - 10 sec .",
    "we expect to reach a sensitivity of v@xmath517.7 mag at 5 @xmath6 in 10 sec . exposures .    *",
    "2 ) delayed emission search : * for up to 4 nights after the grb ( double the time - to - peak for ot970508 ) , 1 hr . of exposures are acquired every other hour the source position can be observed . in this way , we will sample light curves at good time resolution and build up long total exposure times , but still do some scheduled observing .",
    "the apt will reach a sensitivity of v@xmath520.9 at 5 @xmath6 in 1 hr . of co - added exposures .",
    "2 shows that ot970508 would be detectable by the apt at better than 5@xmath6 in less than 1/2 hr .",
    "of exposure .",
    "we will search for ots by subtracting images taken just after the alert , and those taken later at the same position .",
    "automated software will then examine the subtractions for transients , measure their position and brightness , and eliminate false candidates . to facilitate follow - up",
    ", our positions ( better than @xmath3 @xmath7 ) will be rapidly publicized using the gcn e - mail list .      during march - april of 1997",
    ", a short pilot search was undertaken to demonstrate and test our system . while the apt was performing unrelated observations , and while no operator was present , the system responded to grbs 970326b and 970329 .",
    "the system worked as planned , producing a series of images at the alert locations for both bursts ; one of them is shown in figure 3 .",
    "( the bacodine original positions for these two `` test '' events were of very poor accuracy , and the grb position was unlikely to be on our single - pointing fields . ) during another run , grb 970616 was observed for @xmath51 hr . at this time",
    ", the apt requires an operator to open and close the telescope each night .",
    "also , our ccd covers only a @xmath8 field at a quantum efficiency of only 28% in v. to implement our full search , we plan to upgrade the camera with a 79% quantum efficiency ( at v ) 2048 @xmath9 2048 detector to cover our @xmath10 square field .",
    "we will also automate the telescope open / closing procedure and weather monitoring to enable unsupervised searching every clear night .",
    "important improvements are expected in the gcn which will provide locburst quality positions ( @xmath11-@xmath12 68% error diameter , see kippen et al . and briggs et al .",
    ", this volume ) as soon as most of the photons in a burst are received .",
    "these `` updated positions '' are expected to be in place by early 1998 .",
    "our `` prompt emission search '' event rate was calculated by taking into account time lost due to weather ( 35% for our site ) , and time lost due to the moon increasing our background by more than a mag per square arc sec ( @xmath35% of the time not already counted ) , and the fraction ( 48% ) of grbs longer than 20 sec .",
    "( our estimated average time before pointing ) . of the 27 updated positions per year for our site , we calculate that our system will slew to about 18 bursts per year , more than 8 longer than 20 sec .",
    "taking into account the overlap of our field with the updated position errors , * our prompt emission search will image * * more than 2.4 grbs yr.**@xmath1 * * during * * @xmath2-**ray emission , * * and more than 5.1 yr.@xmath1 * * * * within @xmath320 sec .",
    "of emission .",
    "* ( we use `` image a grb '' here to mean that the actual position of the grb is on the detector , resulting in either a measurement or an upper limit . )",
    "our `` delayed emission search '' event rate was calculated by taking into account weather and moon as above , but considering grbs of all durations , and all of the sky accessible any time during the night ( @xmath364% ) . from 52 - 104",
    "batse locburst positions yr.@xmath13 , * we estimate our delayed emission search will image 20 - 41 locburst sources yr.@xmath13 * by covering the larger error boxes with 2 @xmath9 2 mosaics .",
    "we will also acquire 4.7 images from rxte asm alerts , and 3.5 images from sax alerts each year .",
    "the lotis and rotse are currently operating , rapid - slewing , wide - field 11 cm aperture instruments custom built to search for prompt emission .",
    "they have faster response and a higher event rate , however , the apt s 50 cm aperture yields much greater sensitivity .",
    "loneos ( see wagner & shrader , this work ) has a comparable aperture to the apt , but has a limited commitment to grb observations , and lacks automated response .",
    "the apt is complementary to these projects , however , as they are located in the northern hemisphere , and the apt is located in the southern hemisphere for access to the far southern sky .",
    "conventional telescopes have been used to search for ots , however , the apt program has many advantages over these searches .",
    "most telescopes suffer from scheduling problems and can therefore miss bursts , they have a low event rate ( mostly sax alerts ) , and they lack the installed and maintained software required to identify ots on the same night as their discovery .",
    "the latter capability is very important , in order that follow - up spectroscopy and other measurements may be made while the ot is near peak brightness .",
    "the rapid , dedicated apt program avoids these problems , and has an event rate more than six times that for typical telescopes ( due to its batse follow - up capability ) .",
    "in addition , the apt is immune to sax malfunctions .",
    "the most recent sax problems include gyro failure , which means delays in producing sub - arc minute imager positions . without the sub - arc minute positions , searches by typical telescopes are much more time consuming .",
    "a significant - sized sample of ot light curves and more detailed follow - up observations ( e.g. spectroscopy ) would be likely to yield significant , rapid progress in this field .",
    "the data would clarify controversies in the existing observations , such as host galaxy frequency and possible variable extended emission .",
    "a frequent lack of hosts would cause modifications to the neutron star - neutron star event scenario ; confirmation of variable extended emission would locate some grbs near our own galaxy . if the current trend continues , and @xmath3 25% of localized bursts yield ots , our project s high event rate will produce a sample of observations of 10 ots after only 1 - 2 years of operation .",
