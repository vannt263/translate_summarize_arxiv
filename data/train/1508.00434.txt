    "entanglement is one of the principle fingerprints of quantum structure .",
    "we show in the present paper that we can see its friction ridges in all its glory when we interrogate human minds on wind directions . more specifically , we analyse the data collected in an experiment where human participants were asked to choose ` a good example of two different wind directions ' , amongst a set of each time four combinations of such different wind directions .",
    "let us illustrate the experiment somewhat more in detail by first giving four such examples of ` two different wind directions ' , and then describing how we experimented with them : ( 1 ) north and northeast , ( 2 ) north and southwest , ( 3 ) south and northeast , and ( 4 ) south and southwest , could be four such examples of ` two different wind directions ' , they are presented graphically in figure [ examplewinddirections ] .        in our experiment human participants were asked to pick one , and only one , of four pairs of wind directions , and pick the one they considered their ` preferred good example of two different wind directions ' .",
    "we will describe in detail how the experiment was precisely performed in the following sections .",
    "we would however like to reveal right away the attained result : we found that the human mind picks amongst such examples of different wind directions almost in exactly the same way as coincidence spin measurement apparatuses pick amongst different spin directions of a compound system of two quantum particles in a state of entangled spins .",
    "of course , also what we mean with ` almost in exactly the same way ' we will make clear in detail in the following sections .",
    "more specifically , we will show that it is the nature of the statistics of the data collected in this experiment that make it possible for us to show the presence of entanglement that compares to the entanglement experimentally detected in physics in the well - known experimental situation were particles spins are prepared in the singlet spin state , and coincidence spin measurements performed on this state give rise to experimental data violating bell s inequalities .",
    "entanglement was identified as a real existing phenomenon , first in the seventies of the foregoing century by not completely convincing experiments containing still many disputable idealizations @xcite , culminating in 1982 in the major photon correlation experiment performed by the team of alain aspect in paris @xcite , also subject of aspect s phd thesis @xcite .",
    "there existed still loopholes in the experiments , depending on which aspect was aimed at to being tested , but generally speaking also the following experiments @xcite , meant to investigate some of these loopholes , confirmed that ` quantum mechanics describes properly the given situation ' .    without going into the technical details of the quantum theoretical modeling of the situation already here ",
    "we will do so further up in the article , when we have been able to introduce the necessary notions  we put forward a description of the experimental situation .",
    "two quantum entities form a compound entity prepared in a specific state such that this compound entity has no spin .",
    "the state of the compound entity is also such that the sub entities fly apart in opposite directions of space . in regions of space located symmetrically with respect to the compound entity the spin of each of these sub entities",
    "is measured , in direction @xmath0 for the sub entity moving to the left , and in direction @xmath1 for the sub entity moving to the right .",
    "a schematic representation of this experimental situation is presented in figure [ eprsituation ] .",
    "the result of the experiment is that the spin direction measured on the sub entities turn out to be correlated in a very special way .",
    "it is the nature of this very special correlation that make it possible to prove the presence of entanglement in the original pre - measurement situation with the compound entity .",
    "the values of the probabilities corresponding to this correlation can be predicted from the theoretical quantum model of the situation , and these predicted values are as follows .",
    "if @xmath2 is the angle between @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 , @xmath3 and @xmath6 , @xmath5 and @xmath4 ) , then the probability to find the spins in directions @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 , @xmath3 and @xmath6 , @xmath5 and @xmath4 ) is given by @xmath7 .",
    "in the experiments that have been performed the measured relative frequencies of correlation counts corresponded in all cases well with the quantum predictions .",
    "there remain of course problems of interpretation , with respect to question of what the experiments exactly have tested , and we will touch upon different aspects of this type of question while we analyse the situation more in depth in the following of this article . more specifically , we will also pay some attention to a strange type of anomaly that appeared in the experimental data @xcite .    in the concrete experiments that have been performed , an angle of 45@xmath8",
    "is chosen between directions @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and directions @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and hence an angle of 180@xmath8 - 45@xmath8=135@xmath8 between directions @xmath3 and @xmath6 , and directions @xmath5 and @xmath4 , like presented in figure [ eprsituation ] .",
    "the choice of this angle is specifically made , because , like we will make explicit in the following , this choice makes it possible to produce correlations for which the quantum model predicts maximal visible fingerprints of entanglement . since @xmath9 and @xmath10",
    ", this means that quantum theory predicts probability @xmath11 for @xmath3 and @xmath4 directions to correlate , probability @xmath12 for @xmath5 and @xmath6 directions to correlate , probability @xmath13 for @xmath3 and @xmath6 directions to correlate , and probability @xmath14 for @xmath5 and @xmath4 directions to correlate .",
    "note that indeed @xmath15 , which expresses that the measurement gives with certainty rise to one of the correlations @xmath3 , @xmath4 , or @xmath3 , @xmath6 , or @xmath5 , @xmath4 , or @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "all experiments indeed give rise to values for the frequencies of correlated pairs that are close enough to these values predicted by quantum theory to make a convincing case for the hypothesis that quantum theory gives rise to a faithful modeling of the considered situation .",
    "let us now explain the main aspects of the strangeness of these correlations , and how they allow the identification of entanglement .",
    "so this is the moment that we need to introduce bell inequalities @xcite and , more specifically , we will use the ` clauser horne shimony holt ' ( chsh ) variant of them @xcite .",
    "first we want to explain what is the main aspect of physical reality tested by these inequalities .",
    "if we consider the scheme of the experimental situation presented in figure 1 , there is an obvious analogy of everyday reality that comes to mind , namely the situation could present the explosion of a piece of material , and one part of it flying to the left and the other flying to the right .",
    "it is obvious from our experience of everyday reality that the two parts of such an exploding piece of material , flying apart to the left and to the right , contain many types of correlations . to name an obvious one , if the piece of material has a color , the two parts flying apart will have also this color .",
    "suppose for a moment that what explodes is a piece of classical matter , we then can describe this situation by classical physics .",
    "the weights of the two parts will then be correlated , their sum being equal to the weight of the compound piece of matter .",
    "their momenta will be correlated , in case the original piece of matter was at rest , both pieces flying apart will have opposite directed momenta equal in magnitude .",
    "also the distances they are from the central point where the explosion took place will be correlated , depending on the weights of each of the parts .",
    "equally so , if rotation is involved , the angular momenta of the parts will be correlated , and in case the compound piece of matter had no angular momentum before the explosion , the angular momenta of the parts flying apart will be opposite in direction .",
    "suppose that we have some indeterminism involved , i.e. we lack knowledge about the exact state of the compound entity . in that case , also the correlations will appear probabilistically .",
    "however , not all combinations of probabilities related to the correlations can make their appearance in reality in such a situation of an exploding piece of material .",
    "this fact , that not all probabilities are possible , is the main content of bell inequalities .",
    "bell choose to look at the expectation values instead of directly looking at the probabilities , and that is what we also will do here now .",
    "an expectation value for a probabilistic outcome is obtained by attributing value + 1 if the outcome occurs , and value -1 if the outcome does not occur .",
    "so , for the situation considered in figure [ eprsituation ] , the expectation value of the joint measurement consisting of measuring the spin in direction @xmath3 to the left , and measuring the spin in direction @xmath4 to the right , is given by @xmath16 hence , in case of the choices of 45@xmath8 and 135@xmath8 , the quantum theoretical model predicts @xmath17 it expresses that if we give value + 1 , each time a correlation appears of the type @xmath3 , @xmath4 or @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and we give value -1 each time a correlation appears of the type @xmath3 , @xmath6 or @xmath5 , @xmath4 , we find an average value of -0.7071 .",
    "the result of bell s characterization of situations such as the exploding piece of material with sub part flying apart is an inequality that is satisfied always in such a situation . to formulate the inequality we need to consider , next to the joint measurement @xmath18 , represented in figure 1 , three more joint measurements , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , formed in this specific way , hence combining two measurements @xmath22 and @xmath23 to the left part of the explosion , and two measurements @xmath24 and @xmath25 to the right part of the explosion .",
    "what was shown by bell is that for all possible measurements @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath20 , formed in the above explained by joining the single measurements @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , @xmath25 , the following inequality for the expectation values of correlations is always satisfied @xmath26 let us show right away how this inequality is violated by the situation we have represented in figure [ eprsituation ] . to this end",
    "we first need to introduce the additional experiments @xmath23 , and @xmath25 , and the joint experiments @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , as follows .",
    "the additional experiment @xmath25 is performed in such a way that an angle of 45@xmath8 is chosen between directions @xmath3 and @xmath27 , and directions @xmath5 and @xmath28 , and hence an angle of 135@xmath8 between directions @xmath3 and @xmath28 , and directions @xmath5 and @xmath27 . since again",
    "@xmath9 and @xmath10 , this means that quantum theory predicts probabilities @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "hence , if we only choose + 1 and -1 for the outcomes , the expectation value of the joint measurement consisting of measuring the spin in direction @xmath3 to the left , and measuring the spin in direction @xmath28 to the right , is given by @xmath31 then , the additional @xmath23 is performed in such a way that an angle of 45@xmath8 is chosen between directions @xmath32 and @xmath4 , and directions @xmath33 and @xmath6 , and hence an angle of 135@xmath8 between directions @xmath32 and @xmath6 , and directions @xmath33 and @xmath4 .",
    "quantum theory predicts probabilities @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "hence , the expectation value of the joint measurement consisting of measuring the spin in direction @xmath32 to the left , and measuring the spin in direction @xmath4 to the right , is given by @xmath36    finally , the experiments @xmath23 and @xmath25 are performed in such a way that an angle of 45@xmath8 is chosen between directions @xmath32 and @xmath28 , and directions @xmath33 and @xmath27 , and hence an angle of 135@xmath8 between directions @xmath32 and @xmath27 , and directions @xmath33 and @xmath28 .",
    "quantum theory predicts probabilities @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "hence , the expectation value of the joint measurement consisting of measuring the spin in direction @xmath32 to the left , and measuring the spin in direction @xmath28 to the right , is given by @xmath39 if we now insert the expectation values obtained in this way into equation ( [ chsh ] ) , then quantum theory predicts that the chsh inequality is violated , since @xmath40 this theoretical prediction is confirmed by a huge amount of experimental data collected up to now ( see , e.g. , the review in @xcite ) .",
    "it unavoidably proves that the violation of bell s inequalities is a really existing phenomenon in quantum physics .",
    "ut also has been shown that such a violation entails the presence of statistical correlations between micro particles that possibly under additional conditions  we will come to this later in our articles  can not be reproduced in a traditional kolmogorovian probability framework @xcite .",
    "following on our previous studies on the foundations of quantum theory and quantum probability @xcite , we recently investigated how bell inequalities can be violated in situations where concepts are combined @xcite . in the present article",
    "we want to investigate in a deeper and more detailed way this phenomenon .",
    "more concretely , we will put forward a situation , where the bell inequalities are violated in a very similar way as they are violated in the well known and studied situation in micro physics .",
    "what we mean , is the situation of two spin 1/2 quantum particles in a singlet spin state .",
    "we consider the following combination of concepts : _ two different wind directions_. if analyzed from the perspective of its meaning , it is a combination of the following two conceptual structures : _ one wind direction _ ` and ' _ another wind direction _ , but in the english language we express this combination by the sentence _ two different wind directions_.    our investigation of this combination of concept , with the aim of identifying the presence of quantum structures , more specifically entanglement , consists of considering measurements that can be performed on the involved concepts , and analyse the statistics of the outcomes connected to combinations of these measurements . indeed , it is in this statistics that traces are to be found of the presence of quantum structure , i.e. entanglement .    to show how measurements are introduced and analyzed , let us first of all consider the single conceptual structure _ one wind direction _ ,",
    "part of the combination of two such conceptual structures _ two different wind directions_. a typical measurement , let us call it @xmath22 , consists of asking a human person to choose one of two wind directions , for example _ north _ or _ south_. so this measurement @xmath22 has two possible outcomes _ north _ , and _",
    "south_. we also consider the effect of the measurement on the considered conceptual structure _ one wind direction _ , and see this effect as a change of the state of the conceptual structure _ one wind direction _ into two possible new states , called _ north _ or _ south _ , depending on which choice of outcome _ north _ or _ south _ is made by the human person involved in the measurement .    for a typical",
    "setting to test the violation of bell inequalities , we need four such measurements and consider their combinations .",
    "so let us , next to the measurement @xmath22 , introduce the three other measurements needed to define the situation where the violation of bell inequalities can be tested , and call them , also in compliance with the custom notation with respect to investigations of violations of bell inequalities , @xmath24 , @xmath23 and @xmath25 .",
    "all four measurements can be performed on the conceptual structure _ one wind direction _ , but as we will see when we specify the combined measurements , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are to be performed on one of the wind directions of the combination _ two different wind directions _ , while @xmath24 and @xmath25 are to be performed on the other wind direction .",
    "the measurement @xmath23 , consists in a human person choosing between wind direction _",
    "east _ and wind direction _ west_.",
    "this means that this measurement changes the state of _ one wind direction _ into _ east _ or _ west _",
    ", depending on the choice made by the person involved in the measurement .",
    "the measurement @xmath24 consists in a human person making a choice between wind direction _",

    "for example , according to @xcite , aspect et al .",
    "( 1982 ) found @xmath73 , tittel et al .",

    "we performed a statistical analysis of our experiment to test whether the observed deviation from the numerical value 2 coming from the chsh inequality was due to chance . to this end",
    "we computed a one tail one sample t - test for means of the experimental values of @xmath24 in equation ( [ chshreal ] ) against the constant value 2 , finding a p - value @xmath79 .",
    "this is a borderline result with respect to the rejection of the null hypothesis that the two means are equal in the t - test , and it is probably due to the dimension of the participants sample .",
    "however , this issue can be amended , as we will see in section [ renormalization ] .    the result we have just discussed shows that cognitive entities exhibit entanglement , in the sense that bell s inequalities are violated , and this entanglement is obtained experimentally in a way very similar to how it is obtained in physics .",
    "also numerically the violation of bell s inequality is very close to what is obtained in the coincidence spin measurements on pairs of spin 1/2 quantum particles .",
    "let us now come to another important aspect of the violation of bell inequalities in cognitive experiments on human participants , namely , the preservation of the marginal law . as suggested by some authors ,",
    "the violation of any bell inequalities is not conclusive about the presence of entanglement whenever the marginal law of classical kolmogorovian probability is violated too , as this marginal law is typically assumed in some of the derivations of bell - type inequalities , including the chsh inequality , connecting its violation to the non kolmogorivity of the probability model @xcite .    in our former cognitive experiment on _ the animal acts _ , the marginal law was violated @xcite , and we had to explicitly construct a quantum theoretical model in the hilbert space @xmath80 to show that the violation of the chsh inequality is connected to the necessity of quantum modeling the situation by means of entangled states and/or entangled measurements @xcite  were we use here now the word ` entangled ' to indicate the algebraic nature of the states and/or measurements used , i.e. non product states and/or measurements . in the present cognitive experiment of the concept combination _ two different wind directions _ , we found : @xmath81 hence , the marginal law is violated also in our new cognitive experiment , though the violation is less pronounced than in the case of _ the animal acts_. we could now separately construct an explicit quantum theoretical model in complex hilbert space , and show that also here entangled states and/or measurements , i.e. non product states and/or measurements are needed to quantum mechanically model the data . but with respect to this new experiment we want to concentrate on another aspect of the situation , as we think we have identified the structural reason for the violation of the marginal law in this type of cognitive experiments in comparison with a new experiment with human participants , where we will analyse that the marginal law is instead satisfied , while the chsh inequality is again violated .",
    "the reason is that in the experiment we performed the fundamental symmetry following from the isotropy of our three dimensional euclidean space is broken by connecting these directions of space with wind directions . in other words , it is obvious that the participants in their choice of ` difference with respect to directions of space ' will be influenced by the directions being connected to wind directions , in exactly a way that breaks the isotropy of space symmetry of space directions .",
    "for example , the difference between _ north east _ and _ south east _ , which is represented by an angle of @xmath82 if looked upon as pure space directions , might be felt bigger than for example the difference between _ south east _ and _ south west _ , which is also represented by an angle of @xmath82 if looked upon as pure space directions . indeed , both _",
    "south east _ and _ south west _",
    ", certainly in europe , can be connected with relatively ` warm weather ' , while from _ north east _ to _ south east _ there is a substantial change from cold to warm .",
    "many other influences brought into the situation as a consequence of ` wind directions ' not being aligned to the isotropy of space , and hence the symmetries entailed in pure space directions , when it comes to estimating them being different , give rise to effects on the probabilities that we measured .",
    "an analysis of the situation shows that it is exactly this breaking of the symmetry of isotropy of space that gives rise to the violation of the marginal law , while the violation of bell inequalities is not at all provoked by it and in structure completely independent of it .    in other words ,",
    "if we had made our experiment without connecting wind directions to the space directions , and hence considering pure space directions instead , we would have violated the chsh inequality in an equal manner , while we would not have introduced the asymmetry at the origin of the violation of the marginal law .    in a subtle manner , which we will analyze in detail in section [ renormalization ] ,",
    "we have collected all data in the course of performing our experiment with the wind directions specified for the space directions , to show what such an experiment that only considers pure space directions would result in . or , in other words , we have identified a way to eliminate the symmetry breaking with respect to pure space directions brought in by the wind directions .",
    "we will have to make full use for this of the inherent symmetry contained in the @xmath82 angles between all the wind directions that we considered , as it can be seen in the analysis in section [ renormalization ] .",
    "we will show that , if the breaking of the symmetries of the pure space directions as a consequence of attaching wind directions is eliminated , the marginal law will be satisfied , while the violation of the chsh inequality remains unchanged .",
    "the idea we want to explore is the following .",
    "we have performed the four coincidence measurements @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 by choosing @xmath22 to be directed in the _ south - north _ space direction and @xmath24 in the _ southwest - northeast _ space direction .",
    "then we have chosen @xmath23 and @xmath25 rotated @xmath83 clockwise with expect to respectively @xmath22 and @xmath24 . in principle , in case we had been interested in testing rather the pure space directions , instead of the wind directions , we could have chosen @xmath22 differently , in principle any space direction , and then keep the other choices the same , i.e. rotate @xmath24 an angle of @xmath82 clockwise with respect to @xmath22 , @xmath23 an angle of @xmath83 clockwise with respect to @xmath22 and @xmath25 an angle of @xmath84 clockwise with respect to @xmath22 .",
    "if we would choose randomly @xmath22 and then the corresponding @xmath24 , @xmath23 and @xmath25 as just specified , we would avoid the broken symmetry due to wind directions .",
    "however , due to the already existing symmetry of the each time @xmath82 , @xmath83 or @xmath84 of the rotation angles in the configuration , we can annihilate the symmetry breaking due to wind directions by choosing eight different starting directions for @xmath22 .",
    "each time rotating the new starting direction @xmath82 clockwise from the foregoing one .",
    "let us describe this procedure in all detail .",
    "the first starting direction for @xmath22 is the one we chose for our actually performed experiment , hence _",
    "south - north _ , which we have discussed in section [ experiment ] .",
    "let us call it ` experiment i ' . the other seven starting positions , which we call ` experiment ii ' , ` experiment iii ' ,  , and ` experiment viii ' , consist in rotating each time by @xmath82 clockwise .",
    "what is a surprise is that our actual performed experiment has already collected the data for all of these eight starting positions , hence for all of the eight experiments i , ii ,  , and viii .",
    "we have just to carefully reallocate the data collected , as we explain in detail in the following by using measurement @xmath18 as a paradigmatic example . the reallocation of the data for the measurements @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 follow the same rule we apply to measurement @xmath18 .",
    "let us consider experiment i , measurement @xmath18 , and its outcomes ( 11 ) _ north _ and _ northeast _ , ( 12 ) _ north _ and _ southwest _ , ( 21 ) _ south _ and _ northeast _ , and ( 22 ) _ south _ and _ southwest_. to construct the measurement @xmath18 for experiment ii we shift each wind direction in ( 11 ) , ( 12 ) , ( 21 ) and ( 22 ) by @xmath82 clockwise , so that the outcomes of the new measurement @xmath18 of experiment ii are ( 11 ) _ east _ and _ northeast _ , ( 12 ) _ west _ and _ northeast _ , ( 21 ) _ east _ and _ southwest _ , and ( 22 ) _ west _ and _ southwest_. these outcomes correspond to the outcomes of measurement @xmath20 of experiment i , in the same order for ( 11 ) and ( 22 ) , in inverse order for ( 12 ) and ( 21 ) .",

    "then , we do the same with the measurements @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 of experiment ii , looking at the corresponding outcomes of the measurements of experiment i , taken in the proper order .",

    "northwest_.    the corresponding expectation values are @xmath107 for a numerical value of the chsh factor equal to @xmath108 we can see that the value in equation ( [ chshrecalculated ] ) coincides with the one we found in the actually performed experiment in equation ( [ chshreal ] ) , which confirms that our result is numerically very similar to the results in spin coincidence experiments on pairs of quantum particles in the singlet spin state @xcite .",
    "the violation of the chsh inequality is statistically significant , @xmath109 in a one sample t - test against the constant value 2 .",
    "what about the marginal law ? by looking at the recalculated probabilities , we find that , for every @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and @xmath115 .",
    "therefore , the marginal law is completely satisfied .",
    "hence we showed that the combined experiment , testing the estimations corresponding to pure space directions were the breaking of symmetry due to wind directions has been eliminated , does not violate the marginal law .",
    "we also showed that the violation of bell s inequalities is not affected by the elimination of the symmetry breaking due to wind directions , which indicates that bell inequalities violation tests definitely a much deeper property of non - kolmogorovness than the violation of the marginal law does .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the fact that the recalculated probabilities satisfy the marginal law is not the most important result connected with the experiments i  viii that we have just illustrated .",
    "indeed , we can satisfy the marginal law by requiring less symmetry properties to be satisfied .",
    "it is sufficient to consider only two experiments , the first is the actually performed experiment , which we now denote by @xmath116 , and the second is obtained by performing a rotation of @xmath117 , instead of @xmath118 , clockwise , and recalculating outcomes and corresponding probabilities .",

    "hence , the marginal law can be satisfied by considering a single rotation and averaging over the outcomes of only two experiments , hence less than eight .",
    "however , it is our opinion that experiments i  viii express a deeper result , namely , the recalculated joint probabilities present the same symmetry characterizing the quantum theoretical probabilities of coincidence spin measurements on a pair of spin1/2 quantum particles prepared in the singlet spin state .",
    "in addition , by allowing a ` full rotation symmetry in the eight rotations case ' , we filter out the potential biases of the concept _ wind _ , hence _",
    "wind directions _ actually become _",
    "space directions _ , while the complete rotational symmetry in experiments i ",
    "viii suggests that the conceptual combination should be represented by the singlet spin state in a quantum theoretical modeling .",
    "we will see in section [ quantummodel ] that this indeed is possible .",
    "however , a first conclusion can be drawn in this section .",
    "we have identified a strong experimental evidence that concept combinations violate bell inequalities .",
    "the experiment that we introduced contains great similarity with the experiment of spin 1/2 particles in a singlet spin state .",
    "the quantum theoretical modeling of the spin 1/2 correlation situation is such that the marginal law is satisfied , while experimentally violations of this marginal law are encountered .",
    "we want to introduce here the hypothesis that equally so as in our cognitive experiment , the theoretical model of quantum theory without violating the marginal law , represents an idealistic situation were the polarisers and their settings would perfectly obey of the isotropy of space , and that the violation of the marginal law in real physics experiments , would be due , again very similarly to what we find in the cognitive experiment we present here , to the not fully complying with this symmetry of isotropy of space . if the above hypothesis is true , it would make our cognitive experiment a good example to further analyse other aspects of this type of situation , for example aspects related to the possibility to signal or not signal , and what , in case signalling is possible , the nature of such signalling can be .",
    "we elaborate here an explicit quantum theoretical representation for the concept combination _ two different wind directions _ in complex hilbert space that faithfully models the data in section [ renormalization ] .",
    "since we have interpreted these data as symmetrising with respect to the isotropy of space , hence avoiding the asymmetry introduce by the presence of the concept _ wind _ , we will symbolically present these data as a model for the conceptual combination _ two space directions_. to construct the model we follow the general lines is @xcite .",
    "we will see that the model we obtain contains great similarity with the standard quantum mechanical model for coincidence spin measurements on a pair of quantum spin-1/2 particles .",
    "we represent the probabilities recalculated in experiments i  viii , because it removed the bias due tow _ wind _ with respect to _ space directions _ and as a consequence exhibits the required rotational invariance to use the singlet spin state to represent the conceptual entity _ two different space directions_.    let us preliminarily provide an operational description of our experiment in section [ experiment ] , by assigning states , measurements , outcomes and probabilities of outcomes , as one typically does in the foundations of quantum theory .",

    "a calculation gives for this angle @xmath213 .",
    "we have all now to define the procedure that allows us to make spin measurements on particles in a singlet spin state that give rise to the data we collected for our cognitive experiment .",

    "we prepare a beam of particles in the singlet spin state flying in opposite directions , to the left and to the right . at the left , to perform measurement @xmath22 , we place a measurement apparatus that measures the spin in the space direction * a * , which we choose ` up ' .",
    "we choose the plane in which we will rotate later the measurement apparatus in direction to the measurement apparatus in direction * a * as a plane orthogonal to the floor .",
    "we prepare now the apparatus to the right in the following way .",
    "first we tilt the plane orthogonal to the floor in an angle of @xmath214 , and from the new north pole  were the ` up ' was moved to by this tilting  we rotate @xmath213 clockwise , and this is the direction we choose for our right spin measurement * b*. to execute the condense measurement @xmath18 , we choose our spin measurement apparatus in direction * a * at left and in direction * b * at right . to find * a",
    "* we rotate clockwise in the plane orthogonal to the floor at the left , and to find * b * we rotate clockwise in the plane we defined above as the tilted one , both over @xmath212 .",
    "the respective combinations of the directions are chosen to perform the respective coincidence experiments @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .    our quantum mechanical model",
    "is thus completed .",
    "a lot remains to be analysed of what the meaning is of this great similarity we were able to provide between coincidence experiments in cognition on combined concepts and coincidence experiments on particles with spin in a singlet spin state . certainly also the way in which we used symmetry principles to show that a redefined experiment does not violate the marginal laws , and hence provides an example of entanglement much closer to the one encountered in physics than the earlier examples in cognition .",
    "it is our opinion that a further analysis of a comparison between this way of collecting data in cognition and the well - known experiments in physics will shed light on both situations .",
    "our approach to evaluate possible theoretical claims that aim at showing differences between both would consists in asking each time what is the experimental evidence to support such claims of theoretical difference .",
    "entanglement is one of the fundamental fingerprints of quantum structure .",
    "its presence induces statistical correlations that are not compatible with classical probabilistic structures @xcite .",
    "spin experiments on quantum particles systematically confirm the existence of these bizarre features of the micro world @xcite .",
    "growing evidence in cognitive psychology reveals that quantum structures are not peculiar of microscopic quantum systems , but they are also systematically present in cognitive systems @xcite . in particular , we recently showed that the statistical correlations we measured in the conceptual combination _ the animal acts _ , violating bell inequalities in the clauser horne shimony holt ( chsh ) form @xcite , can be interpreted in terms of entanglement between the concept _ animal _ and the concept _ acts _ @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we have presented some further progress along this direction , proposing an experiment on a specific conceptual combination which violates bell inequalities in the chsh form with almost the same numerical value as in coincidence spin experiments on pairs of quantum particles .",
    "more specifically , we have analyzed the data collected in an experiment where participants were asked to choose ` a good example of two different wind directions ' , amongst a set of each time four combinations of such different wind directions ( section [ theoreticalexperiment ] ) . in our experiment human subjects",
    "were asked to pick one , and only one , of four pairs of wind directions , and pick the one they considered their ` preferred good example of two different wind directions ' .",
    "we have described the details of the experiment in section [ experiment ] . however ,",
    "the main result we found is the following : the human mind picks amongst such examples of different wind directions ` in a way very similar ' as coincidence spin measurement apparatuses pick amongst different spin directions of a compound system of two quantum particles in an entangled spin state ( section [ quantumentanglement ] ) .",
    "a relevant aspect of our experiment is that _ two different wind directions _ violates the marginal law , which is typically assumed in the derivation of bell inequalities , including its chsh version @xcite .",
    "this also occurred in the experiment on _ the animal acts_. analysing a symmetry property of our experimental situation we formulate the hypothesis that the ` being satisfied of the marginal law ' would be a consequence of this symmetry being satisfied . hence , a violation of the marginal law would then be due to the presence of a breaking of this symmetry , in our case the biases in the preference of the participants with respect to specific outcomes in the various measurements on wind directions .",
    "for example , the difference between _ north east _ and _ south east _ , which is represented by an angle of @xmath82 if looked upon as pure space directions , might be felt bigger than for example the difference between _ south east _ and _ south west _ , which is also represented by an angle of @xmath82 if looked upon as pure space directions . indeed , both _",
    "south east _ and _ south west _",
    ", certainly in europe , can be connected with relatively ` warm weather ' , while from _ north east _ to _ south east _ there is a substantial change from cold to warm .",
    "this asymmetry , in the hypothesis that we put forward , would then be reflected in the violation of the marginal law ( section [ experiment ] ) .",
    "for this reason , we have renormalized the preference probabilities in section [ renormalization ] by using a specific procedure that avoids this bias , and we have indeed found that the marginal law is satisfied , with the same amount of violation of the chsh inequality .",
    "the data calculated by this renormalization could be collected as consequence of a real experiment on spatial directions , rather than wind directions , with bell inequalities violated , while the the marginal satisfied within the errors of experiment . in section [ quantummodel ] we have constructed an explicit quantum theoretical model in the complex hilbert space @xmath215 with an entangled initial conceptual state and four product measurements giving rise to the same violation of the chsh inequality as our experiment with recalculated probabilities .",
