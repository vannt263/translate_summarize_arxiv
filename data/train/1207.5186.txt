    "lattice - gauge calculations yield a non - vanishing value of the quark condensate @xmath3 in the qcd vacuum @xcite , indicating that chiral symmetry is broken .",
    "this general feature of the vacuum remains present even for massless quarks because the symmetry is then broken spontaneously . on the other hand",
    ", chiral symmetry is expected to become restored at sufficiently high values of the net - baryon density @xmath4 or / and the temperature @xmath5 .",
    "the character of this phase change is not yet well understood but it has significant implications in areas such as cosmology and astrophysics and it is a focal point for current experimental and theoretical research in nuclear physics .    nuclear collision experiments carried out with the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at the brookhaven national laboratory and with the large hadron collider at cern explore systems having relatively small net - baryon densities @xmath4 and the associated chemical potentials @xmath6 are negligible .",
    "lattice calculations can readily be carried out at vanishing @xmath6 and they indicate that a cross - over transformation from the chirally broken phase to the restored phase occurs as the temperature is increased from below to above the cross - over temperature @xmath7 @xcite .    the other extreme region of the qcd phase diagram , namely low temperatures and high chemical potentials , can not be addressed by current lattice - qcd methods , due to the fermion sign problem , and studies of this phase region must therefore rely on less fundamental models .",
    "most investigations suggest that there is a first - order phase transition which , for @xmath8 , sets in at baryon densities several times that of the nuclear saturation density , @xmath9 .",
    "the properties of strongly interacting matter in this phase region are important for our understanding of compact stars .",
    "if indeed such a first - order phase transition exists at @xmath10 , then , as the temperature is raised , one would expect it to remain present but gradually weaken and eventually terminate at a critical point @xmath11 .",
    "the existence and location of such a critical point is a subject of intense theoretical investigation with a variety of models , including in particular effective - field models , such as the linear @xmath1 model ( lsm ) , and effective quark models , such as the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) , at different levels of sophistication considering up to three quark flavors and possibly including the polyakov loop to account for confinement @xcite .",
    "experimentally the corresponding region of density and excitation may be produced in current nuclear collisions at the low - energy end of rhic and in the future with fair at gsi and nica at jinr which are being constructed with such investigations in mind .    in the present work ,",
    "we concentrate on the high-@xmath6 and low-@xmath5 part of the phase diagram with the aim of exploring the expected chiral phase transition which has significant implications for the possible existence of quark stars @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that chiral symmetry may be restored already during the early post - bounce accretion stage of a core - collapse supernova event and the associated neutrino burst might then provide a spectacular signature for the presence of quark matter inside compact stars @xcite .",
    "however , as pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite , the possibilities depend on the dynamics of the phase conversion and especially on the time scales involved .",
    "when the phase diagram of bulk matter exhibits a first - order phase transition , the two phases may coexist in mutual thermodynamic equilibrium and , consequently , when brought into physical contact a mechanically stable interface will develop between them .",
    "the associated interface tension @xmath12 ( which we shall often refer to simply as the surface tension of quark matter ) depends on the temperature @xmath5 ; it has its largest magnitude at @xmath10 and approaches zero as @xmath5 is increased to @xmath13 .",
    "this quantity plays a key role in the phase conversion process and it is related to various characteristic quantities such as the nucleation rate , the critical bubble radius , and the favored scale of the blobs generated by the spinodal instabilities @xcite .",
    "( as we shall see , the surface tension is essentially proportional to the effective interaction range , which determines the width of the surface region , and the spatial size of the most rapidly amplified density irregularity is also proportional to this quantity . )    unfortunately , despite its central importance , the surface tension of quark matter is rather poorly known .",
    "estimates in the literature fall within a wide range , typically @xmath14 @xcite and values of @xmath15 have been considered for studying the effect of quark matter nucleation on the evolution of proto - neutron stars @xcite .",
    "but the authors in ref .",
    "@xcite , taking into account the effects from charge screening and structured mixed phases , estimate @xmath16 , without excluding smaller values , and an ever higher value , @xmath17 , was found by alford _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite on the basis of dimensional analysis of the minimal interface between a color - flavor locked phase and nuclear matter .",
    "the surface tension for two - flavor quark matter was evaluated within the framework of the lsm by palhares and fraga @xcite . in that work",
    "the authors considered the one - loop effective potential and then fitted its relevant part , which included both the chirally symmetric and broken state , by a quartic polynomial .",
    "the surface tension was evaluated using the thin - wall approximation for bubble nucleation and the estimated values cover the @xmath18 range , depending on the inclusion of vacuum and/or thermal corrections . in principle , this range makes nucleation of quark matter possible during the early post - bounce stage of core - collapse supernovae and it is thus a rather important result .",
    "it is also worth noting that a small surface tension would facilitate various structures in compact stars , including mixed phases @xcite .",
    "the present work is devoted to the evaluation of the surface tension for quark matter using both the lsm ( with two flavors ) and the njl model ( with two and three flavors ) following the procedure employed in ref .",
    "@xcite . here , the lsm is mainly included to check the consistency of our procedure by comparing our present results with those obtained by the thin - wall approximation of ref .",
    "@xcite ( we find the agreement to be very good ) . the njl model is considered with two and three flavors because the latter , which contains strangeness , is one of the most popular effective quark models used in studies related to compact stars . as explained below , the method described in ref .",
    "@xcite makes it possible to express the surface tension for any subcritical temperature in terms of the free energy density for uniform matter in the unstable density range . because the models employed readily provide the equation of state ( eos ) for the full density range , they are well suited for our purpose and we may directly employ the method without any further approximations . in practice ,",
    "the procedure is rather simple to implement and it provides an estimate for the surface tension that is consistent with the eos implied by the model employed , with its specific approximations and parametrizations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ method ] we review the method for extracting the surface tension from the equation of state . in sec .  [ models ]",
    "we then present the two - flavor versions of the two models considered and discuss how to extract the surface tension .",
    "section [ njl3 ] is devoted to the treatment for the more realistic @xmath19 version of the njl model and our numerical results are presented in sec .",
    "[ results ] , both for cold matter and for temperatures up to the critical value . the conclusions and final remarks are presented in sec .",
    "[ conclude ] .",
    "we assume here that the material at hand , strongly interacting matter , may appear in two different phases under the same thermodynamic conditions of temperature @xmath5 , chemical potential @xmath6 , and pressure @xmath20 .",
    "these two coexisting phases have different values of other relevant quantities , such as the energy density @xmath21 , the ( net baryon ) density @xmath4 , and the entropy density @xmath22 . under such circumstances",
    ", the two phases will develop a mechanically stable interface if placed in physical contact and it is the purpose of the present study to evaluate the associated interface tension , @xmath12 .",
    "the two - phase feature appears for all temperatures below the critical value , @xmath13 .",
    "thus , for any subcritical temperature , @xmath23 , hadronic matter at the ( net - baryon ) density @xmath24 has the same chemical potential and pressure as quark matter at the ( larger ) density @xmath25 . as @xmath5",
    "is increased from zero to @xmath13 , the coexistence phase points @xmath26 and @xmath27 trace out the lower and higher branches of the phase coexistence boundary , respectively , gradually approaching each other and finally coinciding for @xmath28 . any @xmath29 phase point outside of this boundary corresponds to thermodynamically stable uniform matter , whereas uniform matter prepared with a density and temperature corresponding to a phase point inside the phase coexistence boundary is thermodynamically unstable and prefers to separate into two coexisting thermodynamically stable phases separated by a mechanically stable interface .",
    "because such a two - phase configuration is in global thermodynamic equilibrium , the local values of @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath20 remain unchanged as one moves from the interior of one phase through the interface region and into the interior of the partner phase , as the local density @xmath4 increases steadily from the lower coexistence value @xmath30 to the corresponding higher coexistence value @xmath31 .",
    "it is convenient to work in the canonical framework in which where the control parameters are temperature and density .",
    "the basic thermodynamic function is thus @xmath32 , the free energy density as a function of the ( net baryon ) density @xmath4 for the specified temperature @xmath5 .",
    "the chemical potential can then be recovered as @xmath33 , and the entropy density as @xmath34 , so the energy density is @xmath35 , while the pressure is @xmath36 .    for single - phase systems",
    "@xmath32 is convex , _",
    "i.e. _  its second derivative @xmath37 is positive , while the appearance of a concavity in @xmath32 signals the occurrence of phase coexistence , at that temperature .",
    "this is easily understood because when @xmath32 has a local concave anomaly then there exist a pair of densities , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , for which the tangents to @xmath32 are common .",
    "therefore @xmath32 has the same slope at those two densities , so the corresponding chemical potentials are equal , @xmath38 .",
    "furthermore , because a linear extrapolation of @xmath32 leads from one of the touching points to the other , also the two pressures are equal , @xmath39",
    ". so uniform matter at the density @xmath30 has the same temperature , chemical potential , and pressure as uniform matter at the density @xmath31 .",
    "the common tangent between the two coexistence points corresponds to the familiar maxwell construction and shall here be denoted as @xmath40 .",
    "obviously , @xmath32 and @xmath40 coincide at the two coexistence densities and , furthermore , @xmath32 exceeds @xmath40 for intermediate densities",
    ". therefore we have @xmath41 .    for a given ( subcritical ) temperature @xmath5",
    ", we now consider a configuration in which the two coexisting bulk phases are placed in physical contact along a planar interface .",
    "the associated equilibrium profile density is denoted by @xmath42 where @xmath43 denotes the location in the direction normal to the interface . in the diffuse interface region ,",
    "the corresponding local free energy density , @xmath44 , differs from what it would be for the corresponding maxwell system , _",
    "i.e. _  a mathematical mix of the two coexisting bulk phases with the mixing ratio adjusted to yield an average density equal to the local value @xmath45",
    ". this local deficit amounts to @xmath46 where @xmath47 is either one of the two coexistence densities .",
    "the function @xmath48 is smooth and it tends quickly to zero away from the interface where @xmath42 rapidly approaches @xmath47 and @xmath44 rapidly approaches @xmath49 .",
    "the interface tension @xmath12 is the total deficit in free energy per unit area of planar interface , @xmath50    as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , when a gradient term used to take account of finite - range effects , the tension associated with the interface between the two phases can be expressed without explicit knowledge about the profile functions but exclusively in terms of the equation of state for uniform ( albeit unstable ) matter , @xmath51^{1/2 } \\frac { d \\rho}{\\rho_g}\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath52 is a characteristic value of the density and @xmath53 is a characteristic value of the energy density , while the parameter @xmath54 is an effective interaction range related to the strength of the gradient term , @xmath55 .",
    "we choose the characteristic phase point to be in the middle of the coexistence region , @xmath56 and @xmath57/2 $ ] , where @xmath58 is energy density at @xmath59 , while @xmath60 is energy density at the critical point @xmath61 .",
    "the length @xmath54 as a somewhat adjustable parameter governing the width of the interface region and the magnitude of the tension @xcite . for the lsm it is natural to expect that @xmath62 which , also , is approximately the value found in an application of the thomas - fermi approximation to the njl model @xcite",
    ". therefore , we shall adopt the value @xmath63 throughout the present work . while there is some arbitrariness in fixing these quantities ,",
    "it is reassuring that the resulting surface tension is in excellent agreement with the value obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite .    with these parameters fixed",
    ", the interface tension can be calculated once the free energy density @xmath32 is known for uniform matter in the unstable phase region , @xmath64 . while this is straightforward in a canonical formulation , where each @xmath29 characterizes only one manifestation of the system , even inside the unstable phase region , the task is more complicated in the commonly used grand canonical formulation because a given @xmath65 phase point characterizes three different manifestations of the system , one stable , one metastable , and one unstable .",
    "the metastable solutions are located near the coexistence densities , while the unstable solutions are located in the intermediate spinodal region where uniform matter is mechanically unstable so that even infinitesimal irregularities may be exponentially amplified . by contrast",
    ", only irregularities of a sufficient amplitude are amplified in the metastable regions , leading towards either nucleation ( near the lower coexistence density @xmath30 ) or bubble formation ( near the higher coexistence density @xmath31 ) .",
    "in this section , we review the mean - field results for the thermodynamic potential for the two effective models when only two quark flavors are included .",

    "the two models are similar in the sense that they do not have confinement and they incorporate spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking , which happens at the classical level in the lsm but only via quantum corrections in the njl model .",
    "the fermionic fields representing the quarks are the only degrees of freedom in the njl model at the tree level , while the lsm also contains scalar ( @xmath1 ) and pseudoscalar ( @xmath66 ) meson fields .",

    "to understand this figure , let us recall that , in most situations , one is generally interested only in those solutions of the gap equation that correspond to global ( stable ) minima of the thermodynamical potential .",
    "however , when a first - order phase transition is present , there are two different such solutions for the same thermodynamic conditions of temperature , chemical potential , and pressure ( corresponding to the solid dots on fig .  [ fig3 ] ) . as the net baryon density",

    "the gap equation has three solutions , leading to the back - bending evolution brought in that diagram .",
    "it is precisely this typical first - order behavior that will be reflected in the thermodynamical quantities , such as the pressure and densities , as figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] show .",
    "this behavior is responsible for the fact that there is a ( positive ) deviation @xmath113 , which then in turn leads to the surface tension .",
    "we now turn to our numerical results for the surface tension @xmath12 . to this end",
    "we need to determine the free energy density @xmath32 , which requires the evaluation of @xmath217 and @xmath218 for uniform matter thermodynamically unstable region of the phase diagram . for the considered temperature @xmath5 , the associated density region",
    "is bounded by the two coexistence densities @xmath30 and @xmath31 , for which the chemical potential @xmath6 has the same value , as does the pressure @xmath20 . as the density @xmath4 is increased through the lower mechanically metastable ( nucleation ) region , @xmath6 and @xmath20 rise steadily until the lower spinodal boundary has been reached .",
    "then , as @xmath4 moves through the mechanically unstable ( spinodal ) region , both @xmath6 and @xmath20 decrease until the higher spinodal boundary is reached .",
    "they then increase again as @xmath4 moves through the higher mechanically metastable ( bubble - formation ) region , until they finally regain their original values at @xmath219 .",
    "it is convenient to express the ( net ) baryonic density @xmath4 in units of the nuclear saturation density , @xmath220 . generally ,",
    "as is common practice , we subtract from the pressure any finite value it may have in the vaccum .",

    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the pressure as a function of the degree of compression @xmath222 obtained with the njl model for both parameter sets i and ii ; the latter has a stronger coupling and a larger coexistence region .",

    "[ fig6 ] we display the difference between these two free energies , @xmath225 for both parameter sets ; this is the key quantity for the determination of the surface tension .",
    "the lsm and the three - flavor njl model yield similar results . at temperatures below criticality , @xmath23 , the thermodynamical potential has two degenerate minima determining the densities of the two coexisting phases , @xmath30 and @xmath31 . in all cases studied here , the lower coexistence density vanishes , @xmath226 .",
    "as for the higher coexistence density , the lsm yields @xmath227 , the two - flavor njl model yields @xmath228 with set",
    "i and @xmath229 with set ii , while the three - flavor njl model gives @xmath230 .",
    "it clear from this figure that set i produces a much weaker phase transition because @xmath113 is much smaller that for set ii , as is indeed reflected in the @xmath12 values shown in table i. in fact , set ii produces a greater coexistence region ( @xmath231 , @xmath232,@xmath233 ) when compared to set i ( @xmath234 , @xmath235 , @xmath236 ) , which is in accordance with the well known fact that set ii should cause the size of the first - order transition line to be longer than the one produced by set i which has a weaker coupling .",
    "further refinements , such as finite-@xmath237 corrections @xcite , contributions from thermal flucutations , and the inclusion of a repulsive vector interaction @xcite , also tend to shrink the first - order transition line @xcite so that , within a fixed parameter set , one should expect these effects to reduce @xmath12 .",

    "one can easily consider finite temperatures within the employed models .",
    "the interface tension is expected to decrease with increasing temperature because both the coexistence densities @xmath47 and the associated free energy densities @xmath49 move closer together at higher @xmath5 ; they ultimately coincide at @xmath13 where , therefore , the tension vanishes .",
    "this general behavior is confirmed by our calculations , as shown in fig .",
    "the lsm , the njl with parameter set i , and the three - flavor njl display similar behaviors .",
    "the temperature dependence of the surface tension may be relevant for the thermal formation of quark droplets in cold hadronic matter found in `` hot '' protoneutron stars whose temperatures , @xmath255 , are of the order 1020 mev @xcite .",
    "for @xmath255 the relevant value of @xmath256 may be estimated by using table i together with fig .",
    "for example , the three - flavor njl model yields @xmath257 . the temperature dependence of the surface tension is also important in the context of heavy - ion collisions , because it determines the favored size of the clumping caused by the action of spinodal instabilities as the expanding matter traverses the unstable phase - coexistence region",
    "in this work we have shown that the interface tension related to a first - order phase transition may be evaluated once the uniform - matter equation of state is available for the unstable regions of the phase diagram .",
    "it is a convenient feature of the method employed that knowledge of the interface profile functions is is not required , because their determination can be quite complicated , as is the case for njl model @xcite ( although it is easy for the lsm ) .",
    "in addition to the eos , the geometrical approach also requires a proper setting of three input parameters , namely the characteristic densities @xmath52 and @xmath53 together with the length scale @xmath54 .",
    "while this does encumber the numerical results with some degree of uncertainty , our zero - temperature lsm result , @xmath258 , agrees within a few percent with the approximate value obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , thus suggesting that those parameters were chosen reasonably .",
    "the surface tension determined in the present fashion is entirely consistent with the employed model , including the approximations and parametrizations adopted . for the effective quark models employed here ,",
    "this amounts to considering _ all _ the solutions to the gap equation ( stable , metastable and unstable ) and determine the relevant effective quark masses . in most non - perturbative approximations ( large @xmath237 , mean field , _ etc . _ ) the various quantities of interest , such as the free energy density , become functions of this effective mass and will therefore also reflect the metastable and unstable character of the configuration considered . as a cross check on our procedure",
    ", we have evaluated @xmath238 for the lsm obtaining a result that differs by only about @xmath259 from estimates based on the thin - wall approximation @xcite .",
    "we have investigated the two - flavor njl model as well as its more realistic three - flavor version .",
    "our main conclusion is that all these effective models generate relatively low values for the the surface tension .",
    "this would favor the formation of quark matter and may thus have important astrophysical consequences regarding the existence of pure quark stars . of particular interest is the three - flavor njl result , @xmath260 , because this model is widely used in studies related to neutron stars . here , for simplicity , we have considered pure quark matter where all flavors share the same chemical potential , but it is just a technical matter to generalize our procedure so as to include leptons ( @xmath261 ) in order to enforce @xmath262 equilibrium ( @xmath263 ) , although the additional chemical potential introduces an increased degree of complexity into the features of the phase transition .    in principle ,",
    "more refined treatments , such as the polyakov - njl model , can also be considered within the same framework . however , because the effects of the polyakov loop become more important above @xmath264 @xcite we believe that our results , especially the three - flavor ones , can be considered as reasonably accurate , although numerical variations may arise due to the parametrizations and approximations adopted .",
