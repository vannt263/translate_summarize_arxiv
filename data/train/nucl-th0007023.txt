    "a question that i have been asked many times is `` _ why use effective field theory in nuclear physics _ '' ?",
    "the simple and somewhat glib answer to this question is that the only other option that one has to using an effective field theory ( eft ) is to use the `` _ theory of everything _ ''",
    "( toe ) , string theory or some derivative thereof .",
    "all other descriptions * must * be incomplete at some level and when precise predictions are compared with precise measurements , differences will become obvious .",
    "it is a daunting prospect for us ( maybe only me ) to use the toe to compute low - energy hadronic processes , and in fact , it is quite silly to even consider such calculations .",
    "after all , we know that processes in qed can be computed to high precision which agree with experimental observations , without knowing anything about physics at the planck scale , @xmath0 .",
    "the renormalizability of qed assures that ultra - violet divergences , arising from our lack of understanding of physics at short - distances , can be explicitly removed by a few constants ( electric charge and fermion mass ) , allowing observables to be related to each other to arbitrary precision .",
    "in contrast , eft s are non - renormalizable but are still predictive when a systematic power counting in small expansion parameters can be established .",
    "relations between observables at a given precision will involve a finite number of constants that are not dictated by the symmetries of the eft alone .",
    "for instance , the standard model is a renormalizable field theory but processes at energies much less than the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking can be described by an non - renormalizable eft of reduced symmetry , @xmath1 , where weak interactions are incorporated by higher - dimension four - fermi operators .",
    "even with quantum effects , the theory provides a systematic expansion of observables in terms of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a fermion mass , @xmath5 is the mass of the weak gauge bosons , and @xmath6 is the external momentum .    if one were interested in calculating the cross section for @xmath7radiative neutron capture by a proton to form a deuteron  directly from qcd , then a lattice calculation is the only technique available",
    ". the lattice calculation will provide an unambiguous cross section in terms of the quark masses and @xmath8 , or equivalently in terms of other hadronic observables .",
    "a cartoon of a contribution to @xmath9 in terms of perturbative quarks and gluons is shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "= 2.5 in    sources of quarks and gluons that have non - zero overlap with the proton , neutron , deuteron and a source for the photon would used to generate the amplitude for @xmath9 .",
    "it is clear that a significant amount of work goes into forming the hadronic states themselves , let alone computing the interaction terms .",
    "in addition , as the deuteron has such a small binding energy and hence is quite extended compared to the nucleon , considerable effort will be required to generate the deuteron itself .",
    "unfortunately , at this point in time the lattice community is not even close to being able to perform this multi - hadron calculation .",
    "indeed , the deuteron itself remains to be generated in lattice calculations .",
    "if all nuclear lengths scales were of order the chiral symmetry breaking scale @xmath10 then ( very ) naively lattice computations of nuclear observables would not be that much harder than computations in the single - nucleon sector . however , there are several low - energy length scales that play important roles in nuclear physics .",
    "firstly @xmath10 , below which a hadronic description makes sense , and higher - dimension operators are induced that describe contributions from scales above @xmath10 .",
    "secondly , the scale of the repulsive part of the nucleon - nucleon interaction , which is conventionally modeled by the exchange of vector mesons ( far from mass - shell ) and numerically is of order @xmath10 .",
    "thirdly , the mass of the pion , which is much less than @xmath10 due to its special status as a pseudo - goldstone boson .",
    "finally , nuclear binding energies which are much smaller than one would naively guess .",
    "if one is interested in this process at energies much less than @xmath10 , or the mass of the @xmath11-meson , but comparable to the mass of the pion , then it should be sufficient to use an eft with only nucleons , pions and photons as dynamical degrees of freedom .",
    "all contributions from higher mass scales will be encapsulated in the infinite number of higher dimension operators that arise in the momentum and chiral expansions . some diagrams that will contribute to @xmath9",
    "are shown in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "= 3.2 in    unlike most eft s that one encounters , higher dimension operators ( dim-6 ) involving the nucleon field play a central role@xcite-@xcite .",
    "the fact that the deuteron is barely bound , with a binding energy of @xmath12 , requires a fine - tuning between pion exchange and short - distance physics .",
    "naively , one would expect a binding energy set by @xmath13 , the pion decay constant , much larger than one finds in nature . therefore , the class of diagrams shown in figure  [ fig2](b ) is not expected to be suppressed compared to those in figure  [ fig2](a ) .",
    "in addition , contributions from diagrams shown in figure  [ fig2](c ) must be included .",
    "these arise from an insertion of operators that are gauge invariant by themselves , and are not related in any way to operators describing nucleon - nucleon scattering .",
    "they arise from short - distance physics and have a scale typically set by @xmath10 .    continuing our descent in energy , if one is interested in this process at energies much less than the pion mass , @xmath14",
    ", then it should be sufficient to use an eft with only nucleons and photons as dynamical degrees of freedom .",
    "all contributions from mass scales greater than @xmath14 will be encapsulated in the infinite number of higher dimension operators that arise in the momentum expansion ( chiral symmetry is explicitly broken , leaving isospin symmetry as the only relic of the flavor symmetries ) . some diagrams that will contribute to @xmath9",
    "are shown in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "= 2.5 in    it is important to realize that nucleon - nucleon scattering described by this eft uniquely reproduces effective range theory ( ert)@xcite .",
    "however , for all other observables , such as those involving electroweak gauge fields , ert ( e.g. @xcite ) is seen to be an uncontrolled approximation to eft ( e.g. @xcite ) .    in the following sections i attempt to indicate the status of eft descriptions in the various energy regimes .",
    "firstly , i will discuss low - energy @xmath15 processes involving two and three nucleons , focusing on the recent high precision calculations that have been performed .",
    "secondly , the issues , results and the present roadblocks to successfully describing the intermediate energy regime @xmath16 are presented .",
    "finally , efforts to translate the understanding gained in eft developments to many - nucleon systems are described .",
    "such translation is necessary in order to achieve the ultimate goal of having a perturbative theory of nuclei that faithfully reproduces qcd .",
    "during the past year there has been considerable focus placed on the radiative capture process @xmath9 .",
    "firstly , it was pointed out@xcite that the uncertainty in the cross section for @xmath9 contributed significantly to the uncertainties in the predictions of big - bang - nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) of light element abundances .",
    "this resulted from the lack of data in the energy region important for bbn from either @xmath9 or @xmath17 .",
    "further , available potential model calculations of these processes@xcite are undocumented and error estimates are absent .",
    "tools have recently been developed that allow for a @xmath18 calculation of the cross section with eft@xcite .",
    "this was facilitated in part by realizing that it is advantageous to get not only the location of the deuteron pole correct , but also the normalization of the deuteron s - state component .",
    "this had long been implemented in the methods of @xcite , and implicit in the construction of weinberg@xcite , but was only recently implemented in the dimensionally regulated eft@xcite . finally , there are experimental efforts to measure the small isoscalar @xmath19 and @xmath20 amplitudes contributing to @xmath9 using polarized neutrons on polarized protons@xcite . at the second workshop on effective field theory in nuclear physics held at the _ institute for nuclear physics _ at the _ university of washington _ in 1999 , mannque rho challenged the participants to compute the @xmath19 and @xmath20 amplitudes with the group whose predictions are verified experimentally winning a bottle of exceptional wine . with such a wonderful prize at stake",
    ", many workshop participants redirected their efforts to this project .",
    "this is now known as the _ rho - challenge_.      as existing potential model calculations of @xmath9 are undocumented and error estimates unavailable , a @xmath21 uncertainty was assigned to the cross section as input into bbn codes@xcite .",
    "it would be somewhat dismal if , after several decades of investigations into nuclear physics , the cross section for this process was uncertain at the @xmath21 level .",
    "however , eft calculations have demonstrated that the actual uncertainty is much less than @xmath21 .",
    "eft is a well defined method of calculation and estimates of the uncertainty in a given calculation can be made by considering the magnitude of higher order terms that have been omitted .",

    "@xmath58 calculated in @xcite agrees well with that computed in @xcite , and therefore these observables do not distinguish between the two eft methods .",
    "weak interaction processes involving the deuteron are central to current research efforts in nuclear physics .",
    "in addition to the accelerator based programs to elucidate the flavor structure of the nucleon , such as the sample experiments@xcite at bates , the interactions between neutrinos and the deuteron form the core of our efforts to learn about the neutrino and look beyond the standard model of electroweak interactions .",
    "both in production , e.g. @xmath59 , and in detection at sno ( sudbury neutrino observatory ) , e.g. @xmath60 , charged and neutral current weak interaction matrix elements between the deuteron and continuum states are required .",
    "much effort over the past few decades has been put into calculating the production mechanism @xmath59 , both from standard non - relativistic quantum mechanics@xcite , and from sophisticated potential model techniques@xcite .",
    "recently , eft has been applied to this process by kong and ravndal@xcite and by park , kubodera , min and rho@xcite giving elegant expressions and numerical values of the weak capture cross section that are consistent with previous estimates .",
    "the cross section depends somewhat on the value of a four - nucleon - one - weak - gauge - boson interaction , with coefficient @xmath61 , as defined in  @xcite .",
    "the detection reactions , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 had been looked at by two groups , ying , haxton and henley ( yhh)@xcite and kubodera and nozawa ( kn)@xcite , using sophisticated potential models .",
    "the two sets of calculations differ at the @xmath21 level , due to different treatments of meson - exchange currents ( mec ) .",
    "recently , butler and chen@xcite have determined the break - up cross sections with eft .",
    "only @xmath61 needs to be fixed in order to perform a @xmath18 calculation .",
    "the yyh and kn numerical results can be recovered with different choices of @xmath61 , as shown in figure  [ fig5 ] ,    = 2.0 in    confirming that the difference between the two potential - model calculations is short - distance in origin .",
    "therefore , to predict the break - up cross section with a precision of better than @xmath65 , one has two options .",
    "firstly , compute the @xmath66-decay of tritium , and use this to determine the counterterm @xmath61 in the eft , or equivalently the mec s in the potential models@xcite . ] .",

    "= 2.0 in    an important input into determining if neutrinos are changing flavor as they move out of the sun and to the earth is the ratio of charged current to neutral current cross sections .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] shows that this ratio , unlike the individual cross sections , is relatively insensitive to the counterterm @xmath61 .",
    "significant progress has been made in understanding three - body systems with eft@xcite .",
    "a couple of years ago , bedaque , hammer and van kolck showed very clearly that low - energy @xmath67 scattering in the @xmath68 channel could be described by eft using contact interactions alone .",
    "one of the more impressive results was the calculation of @xmath69 , the scattering length in the quartet s - wave channel .",
    "bedaque and van kolck calculated the first three terms to be @xmath70 where the ellipses denote higher order contributions , that are estimated to be @xmath71 .",
    "the calculated @xmath72 agrees very well with the experimental @xmath73@xcite .",
    "the first term had been computed in 1957 by skornyakov and ter martirosian@xcite while the second term was computed in 1991 by efimov@xcite .",
    "the third term had not been computed before and was determined unambiguously from the nucleon - nucleon scattering amplitude  @xcite .",
    "the results of extending this analysis to non - zero energy@xcite can be seen in figure  [ fig7 ] and are found to agree well with data .",
    "= 2.5 in    scattering in higher partial waves has been examined by bedaque , gabbiani and griehammer@xcite in the theory with only contact interactions between nucleons .",
    "a comparison between the eft calculations , sophisticated potential model calculations and data for one partial wave is shown in figure  [ fig8 ] .",
    "= 3.3 in    -0.6 in    computations in the spin - doublet channel required much more development as local three - nucleon operators can contribute to the scattering amplitude@xcite .",
    "the scale - dependence of the counterterm ( more commonly known as the three - body force ) is quite different from those that are familiar from perturbative field theory .",
    "bedaque , hammer and van kolck showed that a single momentum independent counterterm could absorb all cut - off dependence from the leading operators resummed by the integral equation that describe three - body systems .",
    "the observed periodicity as a function of scale indicates that if a given calculation is performed with a given value of the cut - off , it is possible that the three - body `` force '' vanishes , while for a different value of the cut - off the three - body `` force '' may dominate .",
    "further , the appearance of only one three - body counterterm required to render the scattering amplitude scale independent also naturally explains the _ phillips line _ found in potential - models .    as a last comment on the three - body work , the techniques that have been developed in the nuclear physics setting",
    "are being applied to atomic systems , most notably scattering lengths and recombination rates in bose condensates@xcite .",
    "the situation regarding the applicability of eft s at higher momentum , near or above the pion mass , is much less clear . in weinberg s scheme@xcite ,",
    "pion exchange and local four - nucleon operators contribute to nucleon - nucleon scattering at the same order in the expansion parameter .",
    "a great calculational and conceptual simplification would arise if the exchange of pions between nucleons could be treated in perturbation theory in all partial waves , as suggested by kaplan , wise and myself ( ksw)@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , one of the more disappointing results found during the past year is that the eft with perturbative pions@xcite appears not to be converging  @xcite ( also , see earlier work by cohen and hansen@xcite ) .",
    "fleming , mehen and stewart  @xcite performed an analytic calculation of the nnlo amplitude for nucleon - nucleon scattering in the theory with pions and ksw power - counting@xcite .",
    "they found large non - analytic contributions that appear to destroy the convergence of the series .",
    "in contrast , several computations were performed with weinberg s power - counting  @xcite for the nucleon - nucleon potential which appears to give converging amplitudes",
    ". however , the formal inconsistency of weinbergs power - counting remains .",
    "amplitudes are not renormalization ( cut - off ) independent at any order in weinberg s expansion , however , the cut - off dependence is found to be numerically small when renormalized at a typical strong interaction scale . therefore , at this point in time there is no formally consistent , converging , perturbative eft to describe nuclear interactions for momenta of order or higher than the mass of the pion .    to give you an idea of what has been attempted at these higher energies with both weinberg and ksw power - counting , let me show you the results obtained for @xmath74 , deuteron compton scattering .",
    "three - orders in weinberg s counting have been completed for @xmath74 at higher energies@xcite .",
    "the angular distribution of scattering photons at @xmath75 is shown in figure  [ fig9 ] .",
    "= 2.5 in = 2.0 in    one can see from figure  [ fig9 ] that the expansion appears to be converging nicely to the experimental values .",
    "similarly , @xmath74 has been computed to two orders in ksw power - counting@xcite , the results of which can be seen in figure  [ fig10 ] .",
    "= 5.0 in    very good agreement between data and the parameter free - prediction at nlo is found at @xmath76 .",
    "the agreement is somewhat worse at @xmath75 , and does not appear to be approaching the data in the same way that the calculation with weinberg s counting appears to .",
    "it is clear that higher order calculations must be performed once the perturbative pions versus non - perturbative pions issue is understood , and further , it is clear that more precise data is required at low - energies .",
    "it is worth mentioning at this point that neither counting schemes , nor any theoretical calculation that exists at present comes close to reproducing the recent data at @xmath77@xcite .",
    "there is much work still to be done in this area .",
    "in parallel to the efforts that i have described in the two- and three - body sectors , haxton and collaborators@xcite have been developing techniques to apply the ideas underpinning eft to the nuclear shell model ( efforts are ongoing by others@xcite but i will not discuss their work in this talk ) .",
    "before i discuss this work i wish to show you the results of a relatively simple but demonstrative calculation by phillips@xcite ( see also @xcite ) . to show how the ideas of eft can be translated into a potential - model mode of thinking , phillips compared the deuteron quadrupole form factor , presented as @xmath78 , computed with the nijmegen93 potential@xcite with that generated by an effective potential , @xmath79 ( where @xmath80 denotes the orbital angular momentum state ) and local quadrupole moment counterterm .",
    "the effective potential consists of one - pion exchange at long distances and a square - well at short - distances , @xmath81 for @xmath82 , and @xmath83 for @xmath84 .",
    "the values of the @xmath85 are chosen to reproduce the deuteron binding energy , and low - energy nucleon - nucleon scattering for each choice of @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , the long - distance behavior of the `` true '' potential and effective potential are identical .",
    "further , the tail of the deuteron wave - function produced by the `` true '' potential and effective potential are identical .",
    "as one is brutalizing the nucleon - nucleon interaction at short - distances while preserving nucleon - nucleon scattering , it is expected that predictions for other observables , such as electromagnetic form factors , will deviate significantly from nature when probing distance scale comparable to or less than @xmath86 , for reasonable values of @xmath86 .",
    "in addition one expects to find that the static moments differ somewhat from nature .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that such short - distance modifications can be compensated by the inclusion of gauge invariant local operators . in the case of the deuteron",
    "quadrupole moment it is necessary to introduce a four - nucleon - one - quadrupole - photon operator , that is in no way related to the operators determining nucleon - nucleon scattering .",
    "these operators are induced at the chiral symmetry breaking scale , and must be included in any consistent calculation , and in fact , their omission is responsible for the discrepancy between all sophisticated potential model calculations of the deuteron quadrupole moment@xcite and its experimental value .",
    "phillips choose a value of this operator to reproduce the observed deuteron quadrupole moment for each value of @xmath86 , and then predicted @xmath87 in the effective theory , the results of which are shown in figure  [ fig11 ] .",
    "= 2.5 in = 3.5 in    it is clear from figure  [ fig11 ] that by fixing parameters in the effective theory to reproduce low - energy observables that , even with a nucleon - nucleon potential that has been brutalized at short - distances , one can essentially recover the `` true '' form factor over a quite impressive range of momentum transfers .",
    "this provides a very clear demonstration that @xmath78 is determined largely by the tail of the deuteron wavefunction , the ope tail of the nucleon - nucleon interaction and the deuteron quadrupole moment . for potential model calculations to accurately determine @xmath78",
    ", they must first recover the deuteron quadrupole moment , and to do so they must include a four - nucleon quadrupole operator@xcite .",
    "a very similar exploration is ongoing by haxton and collaborators @xcite",
    ". they are attempting to construct a model - space - independent shell model , and are presently focusing on the deuteron to optimize their techniques .",
    "the underpinnings of eft are basis independent , and as such should be able to be implemented in both a plane - wave basis ( pwb ) or a harmonic oscillator basis ( hob ) . for a continuum process ,",
    "obviously the pwb is preferable , but for a bound state it seems reasonable that a bound state basis , such as the hob , will be optimal . in an hob basis",
    "it is natural to integrate out the levels of the ho step by step to allow for an easier calculation in a reduced model - space . as each ho level",
    "is removed , the hamiltonian and coefficients of gauge invariant operators are redefined to preserve observables .",
    "this is a discrete analog of the renormalization group ( rg ) implemented in the pwb .",
    "= 4.0 in    -2 in    in figure  [ fig12 ] the magnetic form factor of the deuteron @xmath88 is shown versus momentum transfer , where the @xmath89 calculation provides the `` true '' calculation .",
    "the other curves correspond to the same calculation , but with the insertion of the bare @xmath90 operator in each reduced model space . the solid line , however ,",
    "is not just the @xmath89 calculation but also the calculation from all reduced model - spaces when the renormalized @xmath90 operator is inserted and not the bare operator . clearly , a discrete rg can be implemented in an hob .",
    "one of the advantages of constructing a discrete rg for the nuclear shell model would be to greatly reduce the computer time required to compute matrix elements in a nucleus with @xmath91 .",
    "presently , efforts are being made to reduce the shell - model space for the deuteron down from @xmath92 , which reproduces the deuteron binding energy perfectly ( by construction ) , down to @xmath93 or @xmath94 and faithfully reproduce all deuteron observables .",
    "part of the effort is to include the short - range part of the nucleon - nucleon interaction by local operators .",
    "if successful , this program will allow for high precision computations of nuclear properties , with greatly increased speed .",
    "i have tried to give you an overview of a number of important developments of the last year or so . at low - energies , high precision calculations , @xmath18",
    "have been performed in the two - body sector , and progress is being made toward calculations of similar precision in the three - body sector .    at somewhat higher energies ,",
