    "[ lbtojpm1]c are theoretically known to be dominated by the nonfactorizable effects , calculated non - perturbatively with the scatterings of the soft hadrons , such that the pentaquarks are considered as the molecular states  @xcite . in spite of the non - factorizable diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ lbtojpm1]c , which may get enhanced when the strong fsi interactions occur near the threshold to explain the pentaquark productions , we propose another possibility based on the factorizable effects .",
    "we note that this type of the processes in fig .",
    "[ lbtojpm1]c has not been observed in the previous searches of the lighter pentaquarks than @xmath37 .",
    "for example , the resonant @xmath38 decay is measured to be @xmath39 with the upper bound about @xmath40 times smaller than the observed branching ratio of @xmath41  @xcite , while @xmath42 is measured with the upper bound around @xmath43 times smaller than @xmath44  @xcite .",
    "similar to the charmless @xmath45 decays , the upper bound on @xmath46 is expected to be about @xmath47 times smaller than @xmath48  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , since the resonant @xmath49 decays can contribute to the branching ratio as much as 10% , this leads to the question that if there can be other processes , which are responsible for the resonant @xmath50 decays , other than the ones in fig .",

    "@xcite , the lhcb collaboration has given @xmath51 where the first and second errors are from the statistical and systematic uncertainties , respectively .",
    "the data in eq .",
    "( [ 2relations ] ) indicate some new @xmath52 processes beyond the non - factorizable ones in fig .",
    "[ lbtojpm1]c with reasons as follows .",
    "first , we note that @xmath53 has been theoretically reproduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , both @xmath54 and @xmath55 can be understood by the relation of @xmath56  @xcite , and @xmath57 is not far from the relation of @xmath58  @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath59 in eq .  ( [ 2relations ] ) apparently deviates from @xmath60 given by the doubly charmful @xmath0 decays in fig .",
    "[ lbtojpm1 ] . to explain this difference ,",
    "some new thinking is needed .",
    "second , @xmath61 in eq .",
    "( [ 2relations ] ) with the significance of 2.2@xmath62 suggests that a new contribution must proceed with @xmath63 to provide the weak cp phase , otherwise @xmath64 as the case in the doubly charmful @xmath0 decays in fig .",
    "[ lbtojpm1 ] , in which such a phase is vanishingly small .",
    "we hence propose that the resonant @xmath52 processes can be the new contributions to the charmless @xmath0 decays as depicted in fig .",
    "[ lbtojpm2 ] , where the @xmath16 content comes from the intrinsic charm ( ic ) in the @xmath0 baryon . in the followings",
    ", we will assume that these new processes in fig .",
    "[ lbtojpm2 ] are the dominant ones for @xmath52 .",
    "it is not surprising that the @xmath0 baryon contains the ics , which are presented in the fock state decomposition  @xcite as @xmath65 .",
    "in fact , the existence of the ic was first suggested in the proton to explain the large @xmath66 and @xmath67 productions at large energies in the proton - proton scattering  @xcite .",
    "in addition , as a possible solution to the so - called @xmath68-@xmath69 puzzle  @xcite , the ic in @xmath68 for @xmath70 allows a strong decay not through the @xmath71 annihilation suppressed by the okubo - zweig - iizuka ( ozi ) rule . for a heavier hadron ,",
    "since the gluon fluctuation , such as @xmath72 , can easily occur without costing a large energy  @xcite , it is expected that  @xcite the ic component in @xmath0 ( @xmath73 ) can be larger than the proton and the @xmath74 mesons , estimated to be 1% and 4% , respectively .",
    "consequently , in the @xmath75 transition , we only consider the ics in @xmath0 since the heavier baryon would contribute a larger @xmath16 production .",
    "note that , to distinguish the ic in the proton from that in @xmath0 , the @xmath71 photoproduction can be useful  @xcite , which is in accordance with ref .  @xcite . while the study of the ics in the @xmath74 decays has been done extensively in the literature  @xcite ,",
    "it is not well examined in @xmath0 , which should be a suitable scenario .    in this paper",
    ", since we propose that the two new resonant @xmath37 states , @xmath76 the pentaquark states , in the @xmath77 spectrum of the @xmath7 decay can be traced back to the charmless @xmath0 decays from @xmath78 , while the @xmath16 content in @xmath71 is from the ic in the @xmath0 baryon , we will study the branching ratios and the direct cp violating asymmetries , and check if our results will be able to understand the inconsistency between the theoretical estimations in the doubly charmful @xmath0 decays and the observed data in eq .",

    "in terms of the effective hamiltonian for @xmath79 at the quark level , the amplitude of @xmath21 from figs .",
    "[ lbtojpm1]a and [ lbtojpm1]b is given by @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the fermi constant , @xmath82 stands for the ckm mixing matrix , @xmath34 corresponds to @xmath83 , @xmath84 contains the contributions from the non - resonant @xmath85 and resonant @xmath86 transitions , and @xmath87 with @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 being the mass , the decay constant and the polarization of @xmath71 , respectively .",

    "is related to the ( pseudo)scalar quark current , given by @xmath109 where @xmath110 $ ] and @xmath111 for @xmath112odd ( even ) are composed of the effective wilson coefficients @xmath113 defined in ref .",

    "( [ resonantf ] ) can still be reduced as @xmath122 this is due to the fact that , after the summations of the intermediate @xmath37 spins with spin=@xmath123 or @xmath124 , all lorentz indices are in fact coupled to be a scalar quantity , which can be parameterized as @xmath125 and @xmath126 . in general , @xmath127 are momentum dependent , but they can be taken as nearly constants around the threshold area of @xmath128 , at which the threshold effect dominates the decay branching ratio . besides , we take @xmath129 as a consequence of the @xmath0 transition  @xcite .",
    "we hence obtain @xmath130 , such that the total amplitude for the two resonant @xmath37 states is in the form of @xmath131 with @xmath132 , where @xmath133 is the strong phase from the on - shell @xmath36 decays , and @xmath134 and @xmath135 denote @xmath26 and @xmath26 , respectively .",

    "first , for the three - body @xmath0 decays only from the resonant @xmath52 contributions in fig .",
    "[ lbtojpm2 ] , we obtain @xmath146 where the parameters @xmath141 in eq .",

    "( [ 2relations ] ) should be @xmath60 , which is not approved by the data in eq .",
    "( [ 2relations ] ) . however , by adding the contributions from the charmless decays of @xmath148 , the doubly charmful @xmath149 is getting close to the charmless @xmath150 , so that the value of @xmath147 is able to increase from @xmath151 to a larger one to meet the data in eq",
    ".  ( [ 2relations ] ) , as the fitted result of @xmath152 in table  [ fitdata ] .",
    "second , the direct cp violating asymmetries from the resonant @xmath52 parts are evaluated to be @xmath153 however , since the measurement by the lhcb in ref .",
    "@xcite has suggested that the doubly charmful @xmath7 mode dominates the corresponding decay , it leaves little room for the interference effects with the charmless ones of @xmath154 that provide the weak cp phase , of which @xmath155 from the lhcb  @xcite agrees with the fitted result of @xmath156 .",
    "note that @xmath157 from @xmath79 to be different from the data of @xmath158 in eq .",
