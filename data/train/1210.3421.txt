    "namely each hubble patch can be regarded as a small friedmann - roberson - walker ( frw ) universe and each of them looks the same ( adiabatic condition ) in spite of a possible time shift of its history .",
    "the difference of the number of e - folds of their evolution would corresponds to the curvature perturbation ( so - called @xmath0 formalism @xcite , see @xcite for a recent review ) . in this picture curvature perturbation",
    "is a constant ( to any order of perturbation theory ) on superhorizon scales due to the identity of each of the small universe. indeed , if each small universe evolves in the same way , intuitively an extra number of e - folds is not going to change with time .",
    "however , this picture can be changed if there exit another field , say a curvaton .",
    "intuitively the independent fluctuation of the curvaton field will give each of the small universe an additional ( and independent ) contribution of energy density therefore they are not identical anymore ( non - adiabatic ) and the super - horizon curvature perturbation will evolve with time . if the condition is properly chosen , the curvature perturbation will increase from practically zero to the value we need to explain cmb temperature fluctuation and primordial density perturbation .",
    "this is what happens in the case of the curvaton scenario @xcite .",
    "therefore initially the fluctuation of the curvaton corresponds to isocurvature perturbation ( which means no curvature perturbation ) at the beggining and finally the isocurvature perturbation is transformed to curvature perturbation .    for single - field slow - roll inflation with inflaton field @xmath1 , the spectrum is given by @xmath2 where the slow - roll parameter is @xmath3 and @xmath4 gev is the reduced planck scale .    on the other hand , for a curvaton field @xmath5 , @xmath6 where @xmath5 is the field value of curvaton at horizon exit and @xmath7 is roughly the ratio of the curvaton energy density to the total energy density of the universe when it decays . , where @xmath8 in which @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively denote energy density of radiation @xmath11 and curvaton at curvaton decay . in many literatures ,",

    "we found in general the passive fluctuation is enhanced by the slow - roll parameter of the curvaton . in the first case , pbhs is not expected to form after inflation and non - gaussianity can well be large . in the second case ,",
    "we analyse the running of non - gaussianity .",
    "passive curvaton in principle can also be applied to the case of inflating curvaton @xcite ( see also @xcite . ) the original inflating curvaton scenario predicts negligible non - gaussianity because the curvaton dominates the energy density of the universe soon after curvaton start to inflate .",
    "however , the idea of passive curvaton can generate non - gaissianity for inflating curvaton .    for simplicity",
    ", we only considered curvaton field fluctuation to first order .",
    "however , in principle if we consider the fluctuation of curvaton field to second order of field fluctuation , eq .",
    "( [ curvaton ] ) would become @xmath120 where @xmath121 where @xmath93 represents contribution of higher order fluctuation of @xmath122 which contains both active and passive fluctuations . because passive fluctuation is subdominant , @xmath93 roughly corresponds to the contribution of local shape non - gaussianity from active fluctuation .",
    "in addition to that , there will also be cross term between active and passive fluctuations , and higher order term from passive fluctuations .",
    "this can result in non - gaussianity of a complicated shape which might provide an interesting signal to distinguish our model from others , however the effect will be subdominant and unlikely to be observed in the near future .",
