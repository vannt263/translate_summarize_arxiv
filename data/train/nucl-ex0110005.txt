    "for more than 30 years , solar neutrino experiments  @xcite have been observing fewer neutrinos than what are predicted by the detailed models  @xcite of the sun .",
    "a comparison of the predicted and observed solar neutrino fluxes for these experiments are shown in table  [ tbl : solarnuexp ] .",
    "these experiments probe different parts of the solar neutrino energy spectrum , and show an energy dependence in the observed solar neutrino flux .",
    "these observations can be explained if the solar models are incomplete or neutrinos undergo flavor transformation while in transit to the earth .",
    "the sudbury neutrino observatory was constructed to resolve this solar neutrino puzzle .",
    "it is capable of making simultaneous measurements of the electron - type neutrino ( @xmath1 ) flux from @xmath2b decay in the sun and the flux of all active neutrino flavors through the following reactions : @xmath6 the charged - current ( cc ) reaction on the deuteron is sensitive exclusively to @xmath1 , and the neutral - current ( nc ) reaction has equal sensitivity to all active neutrino flavors ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) .",
    "elastic scattering ( es ) on electron is also sensitive to all active flavors , but with reduced sensitivity to @xmath3  and @xmath4 .",
    "comparison of the solar neutrino flux inferred from the reaction rates of these three reaction channels under the no - oscillation assumption can provide `` smoking gun '' evidence for flavor - changing neutrino oscillations . if @xmath1 s from the sun transform into another active flavor , then the solar neutrino flux deduced from the cc reaction rate ( @xmath9(@xmath1 ) )",
    "must be less than those deduced from the es reaction rate or the nc reaction rate .",
    "this is summarized in figure  [ fig : smoking_gun ] .",
    "recent results  @xcite from the first measurements of the solar @xmath2b neutrino flux by the sno detector using the cc and es reactions are presented in this paper .",
    "the measured @xmath10(@xmath7 ) is consistent with the high precision es measurement by the super - kamiokande collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the measured @xmath9(@xmath1 ) at sno , however , is significantly smaller and is therefore inconsistent with the null hypothesis of a pure @xmath1  constituent in the solar neutrino flux .",

    "the @xmath2b neutrino flux can be determined from normalizing the observed integrated event rate above the energy threshold . assuming the @xmath2b spectrum from ref .",
    "@xcite , the flux deduced from the cc and the es reactions are : @xmath11 where the theoretical uncertainty is the cc cross section uncertainty  @xcite .",
    "radiative corrections to the cc cross section have not been applied to the cc cross section , but they are expected to decrease the measured @xmath12(@xmath1 ) by up to a few percent  @xcite .",
    "the difference between @xmath12  and @xmath13  is 0.64@xmath140.40@xmath1510@xmath16  @xmath17s@xmath18 , or 1.6@xmath5 .",
    "the ratio of @xmath12  to the predicted @xmath2b solar neutrino flux from bpb01 solar model  @xcite is 0.347@xmath140.029 where all the uncertainties are added in quadrature .",
    "independent analyses using n@xmath19  as energy estimator , or in various fiducial volumes up to 620  cm with the inclusion of background pdfs in the signal extraction give consistent results .",
    "the super - kamiokande experiment has made a high precision measurement of the @xmath2b solar neutrino flux by the es reaction : @xmath20 @xmath13(@xmath7 ) and @xmath21(@xmath7 ) are consistent with each other . assuming that the systematic uncertainties are normally distributed , the difference is @xmath22 or 3.3@xmath5 .",
    "the probability that the observed @xmath12(@xmath1 ) is a @xmath233.3@xmath5 downward fluctuation of @xmath21(@xmath7 ) is 0.04% .",
    "if @xmath1 s from @xmath2b decays in the sun oscillate exclusively to sterile neutrinos , the sno cc - derived @xmath2b flux with @xmath24@xmath236.75  mev would be consistent with the integrated super - kamiokande es - derived flux above a threshold of 8.5  mev  @xcite .",
    "the difference between these derived fluxes after adjusting for the es threshold  @xcite is 0.53@xmath140.17@xmath25  @xmath17s@xmath18 , or 3.1@xmath5 .",
    "the probability of a @xmath233.1@xmath5 downward fluctuation is 0.13% .",
    "therefore , the results presented here are evidence for a non - electron type active neutrino component in the solar neutrino flux .    the cc energy spectrum can be extracted from the data by repeating the signal extraction with the cc energy spectral constraint removed .",

    "there is no evidence for spectral distortion under the no - oscillation hypothesis .",

    "recall from figure  [ fig : smoking_gun ] that the es reaction is sensitive to all active neutrino flavors , but with reduced sensitivity for @xmath3  and @xmath4 . using the high precision es measurement @xmath21(@xmath7 ) and the pure @xmath1  flux from @xmath12(@xmath1 )",
    ", one can infer the flux of non - electron flavor active neutrino @xmath26 : @xmath27 this is shown in figure  [ fig : fig_3 ] , in which @xmath26  is shown against @xmath28 .",
    "the two data bands are 1@xmath5 measurements of @xmath12  and @xmath21 , and the error ellipses are 68% , 95% and 99% joint probability contours for @xmath28 and @xmath26 . the best fit to @xmath26is @xmath29    the total @xmath2b flux derived from the sno and the super - kamiokande experiments is shown as the diagonal band ( @xmath30 ) in figure  [ fig : fig_3 ] .",
    "the agreement with the standard solar model prediction ( @xmath31 ) is good .",
    "the total flux of of active @xmath2b neutrinos is found to be @xmath32 this is the first determination of the total flux of @xmath2b neutrinos generated by the sun .",

    "two significant results are reported in this paper .",
    "the data from sno represent the first direct evidence that there is an active non - electron flavor neutrino component in the solar neutrino flux , and an exclusive oscillation from @xmath1 s to sterile neutrinos is disfavored at the 3.1@xmath5 level .",
    "this is also the first experimental determination of the total flux of active @xmath2b solar neutrinos , which is in good agreement with the solar model predictions .",
    "the sno collaboration is now analyzing the data from the pure d@xmath0o   phase with a lowered energy threshold .",
    "efforts are devoted to understanding the low energy @xmath33 and the photodisintegration contribution to the nc measurement .",
    "results from this analysis will be reported in the near future .",
    "the sno experiment has just finished the first phase of the experiment .",
    "the deployment of nacl to enhance the nc capability began on may 28 , 2001 .",
    "figure  [ fig : salt_time ] shows the detector background level seen in the cherenkov data before , during and after the nacl injection .",
    "the increase in the event rate during the injection is attributed to @xmath34na , which were activated by neutrons from the cavity wall when the nacl brine was stored in the underground laboratory prior to the injection . after the injection has ended",
    ", one sees the decay of @xmath34na with a characteristic @xmath35=15  hours . the background level in the detector returned to the pre - injection level after several days .",
    "after 8 months of running in this configuration , sno will be able to make a definitive , solar model - independent statement ( better than 6@xmath5 ) on the solar neutrino oscillation hypothesis .",
