    "heavy ion collisions at high energy are performed at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , in order to study the properties of nuclear matter under extreme conditions of density and temperature . from lattice simulations@xcite , it is known that above a certain critical temperature , the protons and neutrons should melt into a plasma made of their constituents , the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , and the critical temperature of this deconfinement transition is expected to be reached in the collisions performed at rhic and lhc .",
    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the theory of the microscopic interactions between the quarks and the gluons ( see the figure [ fig : qcd ] ) , should in principle also be applicable to heavy ion collisions .",
    "however , since the strong interaction coupling constant becomes large at low momentum , it is not obvious a priori that heavy ion collisions can be studied by weak coupling techniques .",
    "this is certainly possible for the rare large - momentum processes that take place in these collisions , but quite questionable for the bulk of the particle production processes .",
    "moreover , since the system produced in such a collision expands rapidly along the collision axis ( see the figure [ fig : collision1 ] ) , its characteristic momentum scales ( e.g. its temperature if it reaches thermal equilibrium ) decrease with time .    therefore , there will always be a time beyond which the coupling is strong and weak coupling approaches are useless .",
    "this is obviously the case near the phase transition that sees the quarks and gluons recombine in order to form hadrons . in the best of cases",
    ", we can only hope for a weak coupling treatment of the early stages of these collisions ( say up to a couple of fm / c after the collision ) .    when applying qcd to the study of hadronic collisions , an essential ingredient is the quark and gluon content of the hadrons that are being collided , since the elementary degrees of freedom in qcd are partons rather than hadrons . on the surface ,",
    "a nucleon is made of three valence quarks , bound by gluons .",
    "however , these quarks can also temporarily fluctuate into states that have additional gluons and quark - antiquark pairs ( see the figure [ fig : boost1 ] ) .",
    "these fluctuations are short lived , with a lifetime that is inversely proportional to their energy .",
    "the largest possible lifetime of these fluctuations is comparable to the nucleon size , and they can be arbitrarily short lived .",
    "however , in a given reaction that probes the nucleon , there is always a characteristic time scale set by the resolution power of the probe ( for instance by the frequency of the virtual photon that probes the nucleon in deep inelastic scattering ) .",
    "only the fluctuations that are longer lived than the resolution in time of the probe can actually be seen in the process .",
    "the shorter lived fluctuations are present , but do not influence the reaction . in collisions involving a low energy nucleon , only its valence quarks and a few of these fluctuations are visible . moreover , in a low energy nucleon , there will typically be interactions between its constituents during the collision with the probe , thus making low energy reactions very complicated .",
    "however , this picture is dramatically modified when the reaction involves a high energy nucleon , due to relativistic kinematics ( see the figure [ fig : boost2 ] ) .",
    "firstly , the geometry of the nucleon changes due to lorentz contraction : at very high energy , the nucleon appears essentially two - dimensional in the laboratory frame at rhic and @xmath0 in heavy ion collisions at the lhc . ] .",
    "simultaneously , all the internal timescales of the nucleon in particular the lifetimes of the fluctuations and the duration of the interactions among the constituents are multiplied by the same lorentz factor .",
    "the first consequence of this time dilation is that the partons are now unlikely to interact precisely during the time interval probed in the reaction : the constituents of a high energy nucleon appear to be free during the collision .",
    "secondly , since the lifetimes of the fluctuations are also dilated , more fluctuations are now visible by the probe : the number of gluons seen in a reaction increases with the energy of the collision .",
    "this increase with energy of the number of gluons in a nucleon has been observed experimentally in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) , for instance at hera .",
    "this is shown in the figure [ fig : hera ] for a proton .",
    "note that in this plot , high energy corresponds to small values of the longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath1 carried by the parton , @xmath2 .",
    "the other important feature of the parton distributions at high energy / small @xmath1 is that the gluons are outnumbering all the other parton species  the valence quarks are completely negligible in this kinematical region , and the sea quarks are suppressed by one power of the coupling @xmath3 , since they are produced from the gluons by the splitting @xmath4 .",
    "this increase of the gluon distribution at small @xmath1 leads to a major complication when applying qcd to compute processes in this regime .",
    "indeed , the usual tools of perturbation theory are well adapted to the situation where the parton distributions are small ( see the left figure [ fig : coll ] ) and where a fairly small number of graphs contribute at each order . on the contrary ,",
    "when the parton distributions increase , processes involving many partons become more and more important , as illustrated in the right panel of the figure [ fig : coll ] .",
    "the extreme situation arises when the gluon occupation number is of order @xmath5 : in this case , an infinite number of graphs contribute at each order .",
    "this regime of high parton densities is non - perturbative , even if the coupling constant is weak  the non - perturbative features arise from the fact that the large parton density compensates the smallness of the coupling constant .",
    "in addition to requiring the summation of an infinite set of feynman diagrams , this situation requires some knowledge about the probability of occurrence of multigluon states in the wavefunctions of the two colliding projectiles , something which is not provided by the usual parton distributions ( they give only the single parton density ) .    a major progress in dealing with this situation has been the realization that weak coupling methods can be used in this problem , thanks to the dynamical generation of a scale that is much larger than the non - perturbative scale @xmath6 ( the scale at which the strong interactions become really strong , and where confinement effects are crucial ) .",
    "this scale , known as the _ saturation momentum _ and denoted @xmath7 , is due to the non - linear interactions among the gluons . roughly speaking",
    ", it is defined as the coupling constant @xmath3 times the gluon density per unit area ( because the lorentz contraction makes the nucleus look like a flat sheet of gluons in the laboratory frame ) , and it is a measure of the strength of the gluon recombination processes that may occur when the gluon density becomes large@xcite .",
    "any process involving momenta smaller than @xmath7 may be affected by _",
    "gluon saturation_.    moreover , an effective theory known as the color glass condensate ( cgc) has been developed in order to organize the calculations of processes in the saturation regime .",
    "this effective theory approximates the description of the fast partons in the wavefunction of a hadron by exploiting the fact that their dynamics is slowed down by lorentz time dilation , and provides a way to track the evolution with energy of the multigluon states that are relevant in the dense regime .",
    "this framework has been applied to a range of reactions at high energy : dis , proton - nucleus collisions and nucleus - nucleus collisions . at leading order",
    ", these calculations correspond to a classical field description of the system . in nucleus - nucleus collisions",
    ", this classical field remains coherent for a brief amount of time after the collision , forming a state know as the _ glasma_. a central question in heavy ion collisions is to understand how these classical fields lose their coherence in order to form a plasma of quarks and gluons in local thermal equilibrium .",
    "the purpose of these lectures is to expose the physics of the color glass condensate and of the glasma .",
    "the main focus will be heavy ion collisions , except for the first sections where the simpler example of dis is used in order to introduce the concept of gluon saturation and the cgc framework .",
    "our emphasis is to present a consistent framework to describe heavy ion collisions from the pre - collision initial state to the time at which the system may be described by hydrodynamics .",
    "the outline is the following :    * in the section [ sec : small - x ] , we discuss the evolution of the wavefunction of a color singlet dipole , and derive the bfkl and bk equations .",
    "this will provide a first glimpse at gluon saturation , and allow us to explain some interesting scaling properties for the inclusive dis cross - section .",
    "* in the section [ sec : cgc ] , we introduce the color glass condensate effective theory , as a more general way to describe the saturation regime . * the section [ sec : factorization ] is devoted to a discussion of the factorization of the logarithms that appear in loop calculations in the cgc framework , for heavy ion collisions .",
    "we show how these logarithms can be absorbed into universal distributions that describe the multigluon content of the two colliding nuclei . * in the section [ sec : pheno ] , we present the main ideas of the glasma picture , and discuss some phenomenological consequences that follow from it . *",
    "the section [ sec : glasma ] discusses the final state evolution , that leads from the coherent glasma fields to the thermalized quark gluon plasma .",
    "the main focus is on the instabilities of the classical solutions of the yang - mills equations , their resummation , and their possible role in the isotropization and thermalization processes .",
    "in order to introduce the physics of gluon saturation , we consider in this section the case of deep inelastic scattering . this situation is one of the simplest , since only one of the two projectiles is a hadron , the other being a lepton that interacts only electromagnetically via a photon exchange .",
    "dis can viewed as an interaction between a photon with a negative virtuality ( @xmath8 ) and the hadronic target .",
    "the cross - section for this process is frame independent , but in this section we will analyze it in a frame where the photon has a large longitudinal momentum , while the hadron has only a moderate momentum .",
    "in such a frame , the photon can fluctuate into a quark - antiquark pair state , but the probability of occurrence of these states is suppressed by at least one extra power of the coupling @xmath3 and therefore they do not contribute at leading order . ] in a color singlet state ( called a _ color dipole _ ) , and it is this pair that interacts with the colored constituents of the target .",
    "moreover , at high energy , this dipole sees the constituents ( quarks and gluons ) as frozen due to time dilation .",
    "therefore , its interactions with these constituents can be approximated as interactions with the ( static ) color field that they create .",
    "thanks to confinement , it is legitimate to assume that this target color field occupies a bounded region of space .      we will compute the total cross - section between the dipole and the target field by using the optical theorem , that relates the total cross - section to the forward scattering amplitude . in the limit where the longitudinal momentum of the dipole is very large",
    ", this amplitude becomes very simple and is given by the _",
    "eikonal approximation_. since this is an extremely important result in the study of high energy scattering , let us derive it in detail .",
    "consider an @xmath9-matrix element , @xmath10 for the transition between two arbitrary states made of quarks , antiquarks and gluons , @xmath11 and @xmath12 . in the second equality ,",
    "@xmath13 is the evolution operator from the initial to the final state .",
    "it can be expressed as the time ordered exponential of the interaction part of the lagrangian , @xmath14\\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath15 denotes generically the fields in the interaction picture . in our problem",
    ", @xmath16 contains both the self - interactions of the fields , and their interaction with the target color field .",
    "we want to compute the high energy limit of this scattering amplitude , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the generator of lorentz boosts in the @xmath19 direction .    before doing any calculation",
    ", a simple argument can help understand what happens in this limit .",
    "quite generally , scattering amplitudes are proportional to the duration of the overlap between the wavefunctions of the two colliding objects . in the present case",
    ", it should scale as the time spent by the incoming state in region occupied by the target field .",
    "this time is inversely proportional to the energy of the incoming state , and goes to zero in the limit @xmath20 .",
    "if the interaction between the projectile and the target field was via a scalar exchange , then the conclusion would be that the scattering amplitude vanishes in the high energy limit ( in other words , @xmath9-matrix elements would go to unity ) .",
    "however , interactions with a color field are via a vector exchange , i.e. the target field couples to a four - vector that represents the color current carried by the projectile , by a term of the form @xmath21 . at high energy , the longitudinal component of this four - vector increases proportionally to the energy , and compensates the small time spent in the interaction zone .",
    "thus , for states that interact via a vector exchange , we expect that scattering amplitudes have a finite high energy limit ( nor zero , nor infinite ) .",
    "this calculation is best done using _ light - cone coordinates_. for any four - vector @xmath22 , one defines @xmath23 the following formulas are often useful , @xmath24 for a highly boosted projectile in the @xmath19 direction , @xmath25 plays the role of the time , and the hamiltonian is the @xmath26 component of the momentum .",
    "the generator of longitudinal boosts in light - cone coordinates is @xmath27 in order to derive the eikonal approximation , the following identities are also very useful , @xmath28 they express the fact that , under longitudinal boosts , the components @xmath29 of a four - vector are simply rescaled , while the transverse components are left unchanged .    under longitudinal boosts , states ,",
    "creation operators and field operators are transformed as follows , @xmath30 note that the last equation is valid only for a scalar field , or for the transverse components of a vector field .",
    "in addition , the @xmath31 components of a vector field receive an overall rescaling by a factor @xmath32 .",
    "moreover , since a longitudinal boost does not alter the time ordering , we can also write @xmath33 likewise , the components of the vector current that couples to the target field transform as @xmath34 naturally , the target field @xmath35 does not change when we boost the projectile . for simplicity ,",
    "let us assume that @xmath36 is confined in the region @xmath37 .",
    "we can split the evolution operator into three factors , @xmath38 the factors @xmath39 and @xmath40 do not contain the external potential . for these two factors ,",
    "the change of variables @xmath41 , @xmath42 leads to @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the same as @xmath45 , but with the self - interactions only ( since these two factors correspond to the evolution of the projectile while outside of the target field ) . for the factor @xmath46 , the change @xmath47 gives @xmath48\\ ; , \\ ] ] @xmath49 thus , the high - energy limit of the scattering amplitude is @xmath50      u_0(0,-\\infty )      { \\colorc\\big|\\alpha_{\\rm in}\\big>}\\ ; . \\label{eq : eiko1}\\ ] ] a few remarks are in order at this point    * only the @xmath51 component of the vector potential matters . *",
    "the self - interactions and the interactions with the external potential are factorized into three separate factors  this is a generic property of high energy scattering .",
    "* this is an exact result in the limit @xmath52 .",
    "( [ eq : eiko1 ] ) is an operator formula that still contains the self - interactions of the fields to all orders . in order to evaluate it",
    ", one must insert the identity operator written as a sum over a complete set of states on each side of the exponential , @xmath53    { \\colore\\big|\\delta_{\\rm in}\\big >    \\big<\\delta_{\\rm in}\\big| }    u(0,-\\infty )    { \\colorc\\big|\\alpha_{\\rm in}\\big>}\\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the factor @xmath54 is the fock expansion of the initial state : it accounts for the fact that the state @xmath11 prepared at @xmath55 may have fluctuated into another state @xmath56 before it interacts with the external potential .",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath44 that appear in this expansion can be calculated perturbatively to any desired order .",
    "there is a similar factor for the final state evolution .    the interactions with the target field are contained in the central factor , @xmath57 .",
    "in order to rewrite it into a more intuitive form , let us first rewrite the operator @xmath58 as @xmath59 where the @xmath60 are the generators of the fundamental representation of the @xmath61 algebra and the @xmath62 the annihilation and creation operators for quarks and antiquarks .",
    "@xmath63 also receives a contribution from gluons , not written here , obtained with the generators in the adjoint representation and the annihilation and creation operators for gluons instead .",
    "this formula captures the essence of eikonal scattering :    * each annihilation operator has a matching creation operator  therefore , the number of partons in the state does not change during the scattering , nor their flavor . * the @xmath64 component of the momenta",
    "are not affected by the scattering .",
    "* only the colors and transverse momenta of the partons can change during the scattering .",

    "it turns out that one - loop corrections due to the emission of a gluon inside the dipole are enhanced by logarithms of the dipole longitudinal momentum @xmath64 , leading to possibly large corrections proportional to @xmath76 . in order to compute the dipole amplitude at next to leading order",
    ", we need to evaluate the following graphs 1to 8 cm @xmath77 we will call _ real _ the terms where the gluon traverses the target field , and _ virtual _ those where the gluon is a correction inside the wavefunction of the incoming or outgoing dipole . in the light - cone gauge @xmath78 ,",

    "moreover , one can see that it leads to violations of unitarity  :    * the mapping @xmath114 has a positive eigenvalue @xmath115 .",

    "this growth of the scattering amplitude with rapidity can be related to the increase at small @xmath1 of the gluon distribution .",
    "indeed , if one is still in the dilute regime , the forward scattering amplitude between a small dipole and a target made of gluons is proportional to @xmath119 where @xmath120 .",
    "therefore , the exponential behavior of @xmath121 translates into @xmath122      interestingly , the original equation ( [ eq : bfkl+ ] ) , did not have this unitarity problem .",
    "when written in terms of @xmath118 , it reads @xmath123 an equation known as the _ balitsky - kovchegov equation _ ( bk ) @xcite .",
    "one can see that it has two fixed points , @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "the appearance of the second fixed point at @xmath126 is due to the nonlinear term in @xmath118 , that we had neglected in deriving the bfkl equation .",

    "the physical interpretation of what makes the solutions of the linearized bfkl equation grow exponentially , and why the solutions are bounded when one keeps the nonlinear term in @xmath118 is rather transparent from the point of view of the gluon distribution in the target .",

    "when the areal gluon density in the transverse plane multiplied by the cross - section for the recombination of two gluons by the process @xmath128 becomes of order one , then the nonlinearities become important .",
    "their effect is to tame the growth of the gluon density , so that the scattering amplitude @xmath118 remains bounded .",
    "this phenomenon is known as _",
    "gluon saturation_.    the criterion for the onset of gluon saturation can be expressed in terms of the resolution scale @xmath129 at which the gluons are observed .",

    "the value of the saturation momentum as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath131 is shown in the right plot of the figure [ fig : sat ] , and the dense / saturated regime comprises the volume under the surface .",
    "note that the eq .",

    ", there is no running of the coupling constant .",
    "this effect arises via some parts of the two - loop kernel , that involve the beta function .",
    "these corrections are known by now@xcite and play an important role in reaching a good agreement with experimental data@xcite .      until now",
    ", we have treated the target as a given patch of color field , produced by the constituents of the target , that are static over the timescale of the collision due to lorentz time dilation . however",
    ", this picture implies that details of this color field depend of the precise configuration ( position , color , ... ) of the constituents of the target at the time of the collisions , that of course we do not know .",
    "since this configuration changes from collision to collision , so does the target field .",
    "therefore , instead of a single target field , one should instead have in mind an ensemble of such fields , corresponding to all the possible configurations of the constituents of the target .",
    "this means that all the quantities we have so far evaluated in a given target field should in fact be averaged over this ensemble of target fields , @xmath137 when performing this average at the level of the bk equation , we naturally get @xmath138 the trouble with this equation is that it is no longer a closed equation , since the evolution with @xmath91 of the quantity @xmath139 depends on the value of a new quantity @xmath140 . by the same method used to derive the evolution equation for @xmath141 , we could derive an evolution equation for @xmath140 , but its right hand side would contain the average value of an object containing three factors @xmath118 , and so on .",
    "therefore , instead of a single closed equation , we have now an infinite hierarchy of nested equations , known as the _ balitsky hierarchy_@xcite .",
    "there is an approximation of the above hierarchy of equations , that leads us back to the original balitsky - kovchegov equation .",
    "this approximation amounts to assuming that the average of a product of two dipole operators factorizes into the product of their averages , @xmath142 obviously , if this is true , then the first equation of the hierarchy is nothing but the bk equation .",

    "the interest in doing so is obvious : the target is very complicated ( a nucleon or a nucleus ) , while the projectile is a rather elementary object ( a virtual photon ) .",

    "in fact , doing so is arguably rather unnatural . as we shall see",
    "shortly , the color glass condensate description of gluon saturation allows a perfectly symmetric description of the two nuclei in these collisions .",
    "before we turn to the study of nucleus - nucleus collisions , let us consider again dis , but this time from the point of view of the target , i.e. when we go to higher energy , we apply the boost to the target while leaving the projectile wavefunction unchanged . in the previous , we simply assumed that the target can be represented by a certain ensemble of color field configurations , that we did not specify .",
    "if we adopt the point of view that consists in applying the boost to the target , then this ensemble of fields must change with energy for the cross - section to have the correct energy dependence .    at the basis of the color glass condensate framework",
    "is the fact that the fast partons of a hadron or nucleus suffer lorentz time dilation and therefore do not evolve during the short duration of a collision .",
    "they can thus be considered as time independent objects moving at the speed of light along the light - cone , and the only relevant information we need to know about them is the color charge they carry .",
    "this can be encoded in a color current of the form @xmath180 this formula keeps only the longitudinal component of the current ( the @xmath181 component in light - cone coordinates ) , and neglects all the other components , because only this component is enhanced by the lorentz factor .",
    "the lack of @xmath25 dependence stems from the assumption that these color charges are time independent .",

    "the charges from different nucleons are uncorrelated , and thus by the central limit theorem , the resulting distribution should be approximately gaussian for a large nucleus .",
    "the locality of the correlations is also a consequence of the fact that charges in different nucleus are not correlated .",
    "the justification for treating the constituents of the target as static color sources is lorentz time dilation .",
    "arguably , this is only justified if these partons have a large enough longitudinal momentum .",
    "the partons that are too slow must be treated in terms of the usual gauge fields ( if they are gluons ) .",

    "( [ eq : cgccur ] ) .",
    "* partons with @xmath193 are treated as standard quantum fields .",
    "because these two types of degrees of freedom have well separated longitudinal momenta , the interactions between them can be approximated by an eikonal coupling @xmath194 , and the action that describes the complete effective theory is @xmath195 in the cgc framework , the expectation value of an observable is obtained by first computing the observable for a fixed configuration @xmath58 of the color sources of the target , and then by averaging it with the distribution @xmath189 $ ] , @xmath196\\ ; { \\colord w[\\rho]}\\ ; { \\colorb{\\bs{\\cal o}}}[\\rho]}\\ ; .\\ ] ]    the cutoff @xmath191 that has been introduced to separate the fast and the slow partons is arbitrary , and observable quantities should not depend on it . at leading order ,",

    "the only way to have @xmath197-independent observables at the end of the day is to let the distribution @xmath189 $ ] depend itself on @xmath197 , precisely in such a way that the two @xmath197 dependences cancel , @xmath198\\to w_{_\\lambda}[\\rho]\\ ; .\\ ] ] moreover , it turns out that this can be achieved with the same distribution @xmath199 $ ] for a wide range of different observables , with a @xmath197 dependence governed by the so - called jimwlk equation@xcite , of the form @xmath200 where @xmath201 ( the jimwlk _ hamiltonian _ ) is a quadratic operator in functional derivatives with respect to @xmath58 . note that the @xmath197 dependence is often traded for a rapidity dependence , by using @xmath202 . the evolution equation ( [ eq : jimwlk ] )",

    "lowering @xmath197 means that one includes in this effective description more and more soft modes ( _ sea partons _ ) .",
    "the jimwlk equation does not predict by itself what the distribution @xmath199 $ ] is for a given target , only how it changes when on lowers the cutoff .",

    "when the evolution of the distribution @xmath199 $ ] is considered , the status of the mclerran - venugopalan model changes a bit , because the gaussian distribution proposed by the mv model is not a fixed point of the jimwlk equation . instead",
    ", the mv model is often viewed as a plausible initial condition for a large nucleus at large cutoff ( i.e. close to the valence region of the target ) .",
    "although it is necessary to specify an initial condition in order to solve the jimwlk equation , it should be stressed that its solutions have a universal scaling property when evolved far enough from the initial cutoff scale : the equation generates an intrinsic momentum scale , the saturation momentum @xmath7 , and in this scaling regime all the correlation functions of wilson lines depend on the transverse coordinates only via combinations such as @xmath204 .",
    "this scaling of the solutions of the jimwlk equation is what led to asymptotic traveling wave solutions for the bk equation .",

    "very quickly , particles are produced in all the other modes , including the zero mode , mostly by elastic scatterings . at late times",
    ", one can fit the occupation number by a function of the form , @xmath348 where @xmath349 with @xmath350 the quasiparticle mass obtained by studying the spectral function . @xmath351 and @xmath352 are fitted to the numerical results .",
    "this functional form corresponds to the first two terms of the expansion of a bose - einstein distribution in the soft sector .",
    "interestingly , the best fit requires a nonzero chemical potential . since the theory under consideration has no conserved particle number , this suggests that the system is not yet in chemical equilibrium even at the largest times considered .",
    "this is expected for the @xmath343 theory at weak coupling , because the inelastic cross - section ( that can equilibrate the particle number ) is much smaller than the elastic one .",
    "another interesting feature is the fact that the fitted value of the chemical potential is very close to the mass of the quasiparticles .",
    "this , combined with the fact that there seem to be an excess of particles in the zero mode , suggests that the system undergoes _ bose - einstein condensation_. we have confirmed this by showing that the occupation number in the zero mode is proportional to the volume of the system . of course , in a theory where the particle number is not conserved , a bose - einstein condensate can not be stable .",
    "eventually , the inelastic collisions will eliminate the excess of particles that led to its formation , and dissolve the condensate .",
    "this is visible in the right plot of the figure [ fig : fk ] , where the occupation number in the zero mode is shown as a function of time . after a very rapid growth",
    ", @xmath353 remains almost constant for a rather long time , to eventually decrease on even longer timescales ( the timescales over which the inelastic processes become effective ) .",
    "as expected , by increasing the coupling , the condensate dissolves faster , because the inelastic collision rate is larger .",
    "whether a bose - einstein condensate of gluons can form in heavy ion collisions is still an open question .",
    "the condition of overpopulation is initially also satisfied by the glasma fields@xcite , but the inelastic rates are not parametrically suppressed compared to the elastic ones . therefore it may happen that the condensate dissolves as fast as it forms , never really becoming a relevant feature of the time evolution .      in nucleus - nucleus collisions at high energy ,",
    "another important question arises : is the longitudinal pressure comparable to the transverse pressure ?",
    "this is an important aspect in the applicability of hydrodynamics : if the two pressures are two different , then the viscous corrections are large . when discussing the glasma fields , we have seen that",
    "at leading order , the longitudinal pressure is in fact the opposite of the energy density at @xmath299 .",
    "this is in fact a generic feature in any system of longitudinally expanding fields .",
    "indeed , energy and momentum conservation lead to the following equation ( for a system homogeneous in the transverse plane ) @xmath354 in order to a get a finite @xmath355 at @xmath299 , it is necessary that @xmath356 vanishes at @xmath299 . as we have seen earlier , this is true in the glasma .",
    "this is also the case in the toy scalar model that we have considered in these numerical studies .",
    "a central question is whether the gaussian fluctuations that are superimposed to the background field can cause the longitudinal pressure to become equal to the transverse one .",
    "this question can be addressed in the scalar @xmath343 model considered in this section .",
    "we simply need to use @xmath357 coordinates , and to setup a boost invariant background field , i.e. independent of @xmath304 .",
    "the connection between this kind of lattice simulation and an actual collision is illustrated in the figure [ fig : simulexp ] .",
    "it would be too costly to simulate the entire volume of the matter produced in a collision , therefore the lattice describes only a small patch of this matter that has a fixed extent in @xmath304 and @xmath184 ( and therefore stretches in @xmath149 as time increases ) .",
    "the behavior of the energy density , and of the transverse and longitudinal pressures , is shown in the plot on the left of the figure [ fig : tmunu ] . at very early times",
    ", the trace of the pressure tensor ( @xmath358 ) has oscillations .",
    "these oscillations are quickly damped , and the system then obeys the equilibrium equation of state , @xmath359    however , at this stage of the time evolution , the transverse and longitudinal pressures still behave very differently .",
    "the longitudinal pressure decreases much faster , and even becomes negligible compared to the transverse pressure .",
    "this is explained naturally by the redshifting of the longitudinal momenta in an expanding system .",
    "this effect is illustrated in the right part of the figure [ fig : tmunu ] : if one starts with a broad distribution of longitudinal momenta in a given slice of rapidity @xmath304 , after some period of free streaming only the particles that have a momentum rapidity @xmath360 equal to the space - time rapidity @xmath304 remain in this slice .",
    "thus , the longitudinal pressure ( defined in the local rest frame of the matter , i.e. in a frame comoving along the rapidity slice ) decreases rapidly",
    ".    however , at some point , the longitudinal pressure stops decreasing .",
    "instead , it increases exponentially and becomes very close to the transverse pressure , leading to an almost perfectly isotropic pressure tensor .",
    "this radical change of behavior of the longitudinal pressure seems related to the instabilities present in the system : at early times , the expansion rate ( proportional to @xmath361 ) of the system is too large for the instabilities to be able to compete efficiently against the redshifting .",
    "it is only at later times , when the expansion rate has become low enough , that the instabilities become the driving force in the system .",
    "it is interesting to compare these results , obtained in classical statistical field theory , with hydrodynamical evolution .",
    "naturally , since the transverse and longitudinal pressures are not equal , viscous corrections must be included in the hydrodynamical description to account for this difference .    in a system which is homogeneous in the transverse plane and boost invariant ,",
    "the simplest ansatz is to write @xmath362 where @xmath304 is the shear viscosity of the system ( this corresponds to _ first order hydrodynamics _ ) . in an equilibrated scale",
    "invariant fluid , @xmath304 is proportional to the entropy density @xmath178 , and it is customary to quantify how viscous a fluid is by the dimensionless ratio @xmath363 . if we assume stefan - boltzmann s law for the entropy density , we have @xmath364 , and since we know @xmath365 as a function of @xmath366 , we can extract from our results an effective value of @xmath363 .",
    "the result of this estimate is shown in the plot on the left of the figure [ fig : hydro ] . clearly , the ratio @xmath363 is not constant .",
    "its time dependence could be attributed to several causes : first order hydrodynamics ( i.e. eq .  ( [ eq:1storder ] ) ) may not be a valid description of the system at these early times , and/or the system may still be too far from local equilibrium .",
    "nevertheless , this estimate is instructive because it leads to an @xmath363 ratio which is much smaller than the perturbative estimate ( blue band in the plot ) .",
    "this may be a manifestation of the anomalously small viscosity that has been conjectured@xcite for systems subject to instabilities and turbulence .",
    "note also that the ratio we have extracted remains significantly above the value @xmath367 , obtained for certain gauge theories in the limit of infinite coupling .",
    "another way to compare our results with first order hydrodynamics is to solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : hydro ] ) with the ansatz of eq .",
    "( [ eq:1storder ] ) for the longitudinal pressure , under the assumption that the ratio @xmath363 is a constant . to close the equation ,",
    "we may assume again @xmath364 . a starting time @xmath339 must be chosen for this comparison , and the difference between @xmath368 and @xmath369 at this initial time determines the value of @xmath363 . for @xmath370 , the evolution of the system",
    "is governed by eq .",
    "( [ eq : hydro ] ) .",
    "this comparison is shown in the plot on the right of the figure [ fig : hydro ] , for several initial times .",
    "it appears that the relaxation @xmath371 is much faster in the glasma description than in hydrodynamics , presumably due to the effect of instabilities .",
    "it is only if the hydrodynamical evolution is started when the system is already well isotropized that it provides a good description of the evolution of the system .",
    "naturally , eq .  ( [ eq : hydro ] ) is certainly valid because it is just a consequence of energy and momentum conservation .",
    "therefore , this comparison questions the validity of the first order approximation to describe the viscous corrections ( and the non - constancy of the ratio @xmath363 when extracted directly from @xmath372 points also in the same direction ) .",
    "the other conclusion one can make from this comparison , given the fact that hydrodynamics is the limit of kinetic theory when the mean free path goes to zero , is that instabilities are more efficient than collisions to isotropize the system .",
    "in this review , we have presented the color glass condensate effective theory , that describes the partonic content of a hadron or nucleus in the saturated regime .",
    "gluon saturation , that happens at high energy , is characterized by large gluon occupation numbers , and by non - linear effects not present in the dilute regime . in order to describe collisions involving hadrons in this regime",
    ", one needs a framework that provides a handle on multi - gluon fock states in the hadron wavefunction , and the tools to perform calculations with these states .",
    "the color glass condensate approximates the fast partons as stochastic classical color sources , while the usual field description is retained for the slow gluons .",
    "the requirement that observables be independent on the cutoff that separates these two types of degrees of freedom leads to a renormalization group equation ( the jimwlk equation ) for the distribution of the classical sources .",
    "a crucial aspect of the physics of gluon saturation is that the non - linear dynamics generates a semi - hard scale , the saturation momentum .",
    "this scale , that increases with energy , plays a crucial role because it sets the value of the strong coupling constant , allowing a weak coupling treatment of gluon saturation . nevertheless , even at weak coupling , the study of hadronic or nuclear collisions in the saturated regime is non - perturbative , because the smallness of the coupling is compensated by the large occupation numbers for the gluons below the saturation momentum .",
    "the color glass condensate framework proves especially useful in the study of heavy ion collisions at high energy , because the bulk of particle production in these collisions is controlled by the physics of gluon saturation .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that inclusive observables can be factorized ( at leading logarithmic accuracy so far ) as a convolution of universal distributions of color sources representing the gluon content of the two colliding nuclei , and an observable evaluated in the retarded classical field produced by these sources .",
    "the universality of these distributions of sources , and therefore of the classical color field they produce , confers to these field configurations the _ glasma_ a very central role in the cgc description of heavy ion collisions . at very short times after the collision ,",
    "they are characterized by longitudinal chromo - electric and chromo - magnetic fields that are nearly boost invariant , with a transverse correlation length of the order of the inverse saturation momentum . in particular , these fields that have long range correlations in rapidity have been invoked in order to explain the observed two - hadron correlations in heavy ion collisions .",
    "the initial glasma fields form a system which is very from local equilibrium : it is a coherent state rather than a mixed thermal state , and it has a large negative longitudinal pressure .",
    "moreover , these fields are unstable against small perturbations of their initial conditions . in fixed order",
    "cgc calculations , these unstable modes lead to secular divergences in quantities such as the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "this pathology can be cured by a resummation that amounts to letting the initial glasma field fluctuate around its classical value , with a gaussian spectrum determined by a one - loop calculation .",
    "a numerical implementation of this resummation in a much simpler scalar field theory has recently shown that the instabilities lead to the isotropization of the transverse and longitudinal pressures shortly after the collision , and to full thermalization on longer timescales . whether this is also the case in qcd , and over which timescale , is the subject of ongoing works .",
    "i would like to thank the organizers of the 22nd jyvskyl summer school , where these lectures have been delivered , and in particular t. lappi and t. renk , as well as all the students for their questions and remarks .",
