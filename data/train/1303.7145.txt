    "given a genus-@xmath0 heegaard splitting of a closed orientable @xmath1-manifold , the genus-@xmath0 _ goeritz group _ is the group of isotopy classes of orientation - preserving homeomorphisms of the manifold preserving each of the handlebodies of the splitting setwise . when a manifold admits a unique heegaard splitting of genus @xmath0 up to isotopy , we might define the genus-@xmath0 goeritz group of the manifold without mentioning a specific splitting .",
    "for example , the @xmath1-sphere , @xmath3 and lens spaces are known to be such manifolds from @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is natural to study the structures of goeritz groups and to ask if they are finitely generated or presented , and so finding their generating sets or presentations has been an interesting problem .",
    "but the generating sets or the presentations of those groups have been obtained only for few manifolds with their splittings of small genus .",
    "a finite presentation of the genus-@xmath2 goeritz group of the @xmath1-sphere was obtained from the works of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , and recently of each lens space @xmath4 in @xcite .",

    "the genus-@xmath2 goeritz group @xmath5 has the presentation @xmath6 [ thm : presentation ]    the generators @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are illustrated in figure [ fig_generators ] as orientation - preserving homeomorphisms of a heegaard surface which can extend to homeomorphisms of the whole @xmath3 .",

    "finally , @xmath18 will denote a regular neighborhood of @xmath19 and @xmath20 the closure of @xmath19 for a subspace @xmath19 of a polyhedral space , where the ambient space will always be clear from the context .",

    "let @xmath25 and @xmath44 be any two non - isotopic dual disks of @xmath24 .",

    "the connectivity of @xmath108 also can be shown in a similar way , by considering surgery on a common dual disk .",
