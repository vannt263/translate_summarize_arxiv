    "classical harmony has been largely studied , however musicians often are hard put to understand the real nature of modes and the concept of sonority in modern music . in western music theory , the word `` mode '' ( from latin modus , `` measure , way , size , method '' ) generally refers to a type of scale , coupled with a set of characteristic melodic behaviours .",
    "more precisely the concept of mode incorporates the idea of the diatonic scale , but differs from it involving an element of melody type .",
    "this concerns particular repertories of short musical figures or groups of tones within a certain scale so that , depending on the point of view , mode takes the meaning of either a `` particularized scale '' or a `` generalized tune '' .    the goal of this paper is to construct modes from a genuine harmonic viewpoint ; more precisely , a mode is not treated only like a scale ( and hence an ordered sequence of pitches ) but also as a superimposition of two chords : a _ base - chord _ and a _",
    "tension chord_. from a technical musical viewpoint , the base - chord is a seventh chord and the tension one is a triad .",
    "of course as one can easily figure out not every seventh chord is admissible as base - chord as well as not every triad is compatible with a fixed seventh chord .",
    "specifically , the base - chords have to be into 7 classes corresponding to the types of chord we can deduce harmonizing each degree of the major , harmonic and melodic minor scales . each base - chord and the fact that we deduce modes using three scales `` force '' the superimposition of some specific triads which are chosen decomposing the classical modal scales ; namely , not every triad can be used to produce a mode , as we shall see later .    starting from a fixed base - chord",
    "we shall consider only the triads that give us the classical modes and we shall associate in a quite elementary way an oriented planar connected graph @xmath1 ( the order being established by the scale s degrees ) and hence a topological measure of complexity given by the @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes the euler characteristic .",
    "it is a well - known fact that the fundamental group of @xmath1 , i.e. @xmath4 is a free group over @xmath5 generators .",
    "moreover @xmath3 is a topological invariant .",
    "each mode is a subgraph of the associated graph such that each vertex ( except the first and the last one ) has valence at least @xmath6 ( i.e. at least two edges connect the vertex in the graph ) .",
    "our first result is that out of the classical @xmath7 modes which we shall refer as _ standard modes _ , other @xmath8 `` exceptional '' modes arise",
    ". we shall refer to them as _",
    "admissible special modes _",
    "( see proposition [ prop : specmodes ] ) .",
    "the most important fact is that one of these modes which is called @xmath9 allows us to well `` approximate '' an octatonic half step / whole step scale used in a famous fusion piece , with a 7 notes scale , conserving entirely the notes of the chord played in the harmonic structure ( a dominant chord in the case we examine ) .",
    "this fact allows either the composer or the improviser to constantly see the notes of resolutions which are the base - chord and to clearly distinguish them from the tension notes which are collected in the tension - triad .",
    "moreover in the @xmath10 we have the presence of the tritone which makes the dominant chord recognizable , as the @xmath11 and the augmented fourth which greatly contribute to the tension of the mode .",
    "we would like to stress the fact that modes attracted the attention of many music theorists over the years .",
    "however , to the knowledge of the authors , the analysis carried over is mainly of quantitative type and in fact it is based on algebra and combinatorics .",
    "we shall refer to the papers of @xcite and references therein .",
    "our approach is in the opposite direction being somehow qualitative in the essence and for this reason the suitable mathematical tools are mainly based on the use of ( elementary ) algebraic topology .",
    "in contrast to the first part which is `` static '' in the essence , in the second part of the paper we analyse some harmonic progressions . more precisely we take into account some well - known cadential chord progressions in modern music and in the special case in jazz music which are based on perfect , deceptive , plagal and secondary dominant progressions . our main mathematical device in order to carry over our investigation is based on the geometrical interpretation through braids which give us a suggestive and net interpretation of the mathematical structure behind this corner of the musical world .",
    "we analyse the same harmonic fragment we used to test the special modes , which put on evidence a sort of `` musical complexity '' through its representation with braids .",
    "this is the starting point of a forthcoming paper in which the braids structure of some cadences are used in order to construct suitable topological spaces having highly non - trivial homotopic properties .",
    "these properties allow us to define in a very clear and rigorous way a sort of _ musical complexity _ which could be used in order to classify some musical pieces , as well as to distinguish the degree of complexity of a composition or improvisation .",
    "( see section [ sec : conclusions ] for further details and future projects ) .",
    "the aim of this section is to recall some well - known facts and definitions about the classical construction of modes in modern music .",
    "a definition of mode @xcite is that it is a seven - note scale created by starting on any of the seven note of a major or a melodic minor scale .",
    "the section is structured as follows : in the first paragraph we deduce the modes from the major , melodic minor and harmonic minor scale . in the second paragraph a mathematical way to represent chords and modes is shown .",
    "we conclude the section showing a non - standard way to think about modes as a superimposition of two chords .      following the definition given in @xcite ,",
    "we assume that a mode is an heptatonic scale , however we include the harmonic minor in the set of scales we use to deduce the standard modes .",
    "the reason which lead us to consider this scale is that it allows us to define naturally some really used and interesting modes like the _ phrygian dominant_. the classical way to deduce modes from scales is to consider each degree of the scale as the root of the modal scale . in table",
    "[ tab : clasmode ] we list the @xmath7 modes given by the major , melodic minor and harmonic minor scale , examples have been built on the c major ( @xmath12 ) , melodic minor ( @xmath13 ) and harmonic minor ( @xmath14 ) scale respectively .",
    "@xmath7 modes derived from the major , melodic minor and harmonic minor scale . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we start this section by putting on evidence the major achievements of this paper .",
    "we starting by revising an heptatonic modal scale as a superimposition of two chords , playing two completely different roles . a base - chord @xmath15 $ ] which is represented by a seventh chord and a tension - triad constructed above it .",
    "thus we can summarise it by as : `` @xmath16 '' from a genuinely musical viewpoint this introduce a striking difference since magnify the harmonic and melodic characteristic of the modal scale .",
    "the second achievement is to associate a 2-dimensional oriented planar graph to each base - chord reflecting its freedom to support tensions . by using this graph",
    "we are able to pull out from the same tonal system , or even better on the classical harminization , some _ special modes _ and hence some _ new _",
    "( heptatonic ) modal scales .",
    "the third , from our point of view , interesting achievement is the topological measure of complexity .",
    "this is given in terms of the euler characteristic of a graph , and hence it is stable under homeomorphism of graphs .",
    "this is an important property making our construction independent on the choices of the positions of the degrees of the scale . from a mathematical point of view",
    "the euler characteristic is an integer between @xmath17 and @xmath18 included .",
    "bigger this invariant , less degrees of freedom a base - chord has to support tension . from a musical point of view",
    "this reflects a major degree of freedom in the improvisation as well as composing .",
    "although this qualitative analysis give us a new insight on the modal scales , it is still poor in order to classify some modern tracks as well as to analyse some popular modern chord progressions and cadences .",
    "for this reason in section [ sec : braids ] we introduce a braids theoretical interpretation of the above introduced graphs .",
    "this in particular allows us to associate to each chord progression , a braid in a quite effective and explicitly way by showing the voice - leading of the progression .",
    "we finally applied our results in order to better understand _ peru_. more precisely , by using the graph theoretic results and in particular the new special mode @xmath19 we are able to give a `` nice '' approximation of the octatonic scale by using an heptatonic one . of",
    "course we have to give up to one note , but as we showed in the previous section , the note dropped out does not contribute to the tensions required explicitly by the chord .",
    "in fact the modal scale used as approximation includes the tensions which characterize the octatonic scale and the stable notes needed to be as melodic as possible on a such altered chord , making our result very reasonable also from the musical point of view .",
    "we point out this approximation is good with respect to any chosen metric ( intervallic , etc ) , simply because it shares 7 notes with the octatonic scale chosen by scott henderson .    using the braid theoretical approach to analyse peru , we are able to figure out how complicate is the chord progression used by scott henderson in comparison to the most standard and popular chord progressions .    in a forthcoming paper",
    "we shall try to distinguish about different melodic lines , constructed over the same base - chord progressions . from a mathematical viewpoint we shall construct some different topological spaces reflecting the crossings between the strand associated to a melodic line with respect to the underground braid .",
    "this will give us a sort of measure of complexity associated to a melodic phrase or to an improvisation and even to a classification of jazz and modern standard tracks .",
