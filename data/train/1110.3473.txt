    "the past two decades have seen vast improvements in the sensitivity and detector counts of broadband ( sub)millimeter imaging cameras , from single pixel receivers to background - limited kilopixel arrays ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "many of these instruments have relied on the planets , along with a handful of secondary calibrators , to obtain @xmath4% flux calibrations ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , some of the large - scale survey instruments have used cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) measurements to calibrate their data to even better precision ( e.g. , @xcite ) . however",
    ", calibrating from the cmb is only practical for instruments that image @xmath5 deg@xmath6 , and therefore can not be done in many cases .",
    "when planets and secondary calibrators are used , the accuracy of the flux calibration is often limited by uncertainties in the brightness of these calibrators rather than by measurement uncertainties ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , accurate measurements of the absolute brightness of the planets and secondary calibrators , along with a detailed understanding of any temporal variability in these brightnesses , is critical to maximizing the scientific potential of current and future ( sub)millimeter cameras .    until recently , systematic uncertainties in the brightness of uranus and neptune",
    "have been @xmath7% , owing to uncertainties in the martian brightness used to determine the absolute brightness of each of these planets ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , g93 ) .",
    "however , recently published wmap results have significantly improved the constraints on the brightness of mars ( @xmath8% ) and uranus ( @xmath3% ) by calibrating them relative to the cmb @xcite .",
    "wmap has also published cmb - calibrated brightness measurements of neptune accurate to 8% @xcite .",
    "additionally , recently published results have shown evidence for a @xmath9% decrease in the brightness of uranus at 8.6 and 90  ghz over the @xmath10 year period from the mid 1980s to the mid 2000s ( @xcite and @xcite ) , which have been attributed to changes in the relative viewing angle of the planet from earth due to its large obliquity of 82 deg .",
    "note that , over the period of observations in kl06 and kr08 the sep latitude of uranus ranged from a minimum of @xmath11  deg in 1985 to a maximum of @xmath12  deg in 2005 .",
    "these data indicate that the brightness of uranus increases as the magnitude of the sub - earth point ( sep ) latitude increases ( i.e. , the south pole of uranus is brighter than the equatorial regions ) .",
    "further evidence for this scenario comes from resolved cm - wave images of uranus , which indicate that the poles are brighter than the equatorial regions @xcite .",
    "bolocam is a large - format bolometric camera with an 8  arcmin field of view capable of observing at either 143 or 268  ghz .",
    "bolocam began collecting scientific data in early 2003 at the caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) , and was commissioned as a facility instrument later that year  @xcite . in this manuscript",
    "we focus exclusively on 143  ghz bolocam data , which was collected between 2003 and 2010 during nine separate observing runs ( see table  [ tab : obs ] ) .",
    "all of the data collected with bolocam has been calibrated using the planets ( generally uranus and neptune ) , along with sources given in @xcite .",
    "the bolocam flux calibration procedure is described in detail in @xcite and @xcite , and we briefly describe the details below .",

    "additionally , the responsivity ( in nv / jy ) of the bolometers increases as the bolometer resistance increases .",
    "consequently , we are able to simultaneously account for changes in atmospheric transmission and detector responsivity by fitting the flux calibration as a function of bias carrier amplitude . in practice",
    ", the technique works as follows . for a given observing run ,",
    "we generally observe multiple sources that have constant brightnesses .",
    "we then simultaneously fit the data for all of these sources according to @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the bolometer response to source @xmath15 ( in nv ) , @xmath16 is the brightness of source @xmath15 , @xmath17 is the solid angle of source @xmath15 during observation @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the bolometer resistance during observation @xmath18 as measured by the bias carrier amplitude , and @xmath20 and @xmath21 describe how the bolometer response changes as a function of @xmath22 .",
    "implicit in the above formula is the assumption that changes in the overall opacity of the atmosphere are completely accounted for via @xmath20 and @xmath21 , which implies that the atmospheric transmission varies in a such way that the shape of the bolocam bandpass through the atmosphere is constant .",
    "however , over the range of conditions where these data were collected ( column depths of precipitable water between 0.5 and 3.0  mm ) , variations in the atmospheric opacity do cause the bolocam bandpass to vary slightly @xcite ) . for",
    "a typical observing run , these bandpass variations in the atmosphere add an additional uncertainty of @xmath23% to our measured brightness ratios , which is negligible compared to our measurement uncertainties of @xmath24% .",
    "note that we have assumed that the angular size of the source is much smaller than the angular size of the bolocam point - spread function , which is true for all of the sources ( uranus ) , @xmath8 ( neptune ) , @xmath25 ( ngc 2071ir ) , @xmath26 ( g34.3 ) , and @xmath27 ( k3 - 50a ) , all of which are small compared to bolocam s 59  arcsec full - width at half - maximum point - spread function @xcite .",
    "the secondary calibrators are large enough that our point - like assumption will cause us to underestimate the total surface brightness of these objects by @xmath28% ( see section  [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "uranus and neptune are small enough that the correction is negligible ( @xmath29% ) . ] .",
    "since the solid angle of both uranus and neptune varies with observation epoch , we compute the value of @xmath17 separately for each integration of these planets using the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) fluxes program . for the secondary calibrators ,",
    "the value of @xmath17 is assumed to be constant .",

    "seven bolocam observing runs contain observations of both uranus and neptune . in each run",
    ", we measure the brightness ratio of uranus to neptune with @xmath49% statistical uncertainty .",
    "if we assume that the brightness ratio is constant over the period from 2003 to 2010 , then we find that @xmath50 with @xmath51 .",
    "a linear fit versus year to the data reduces the value of @xmath52 by 0.9 , indicating that a linear fit is not required ( a f - test shows that 39% of realizations of constant data would have yielded a larger f - ratio , implying that a constant fit to our data is adequate ) . comparing to published results at similar frequencies , o86 find a brightness ratio of @xmath53 using 150  ghz data collected between february 1983 and march 1984 at the national radio astronomy observatory 12-m antenna at kitt peak , and g93 find a brightness ratio of @xmath54 using 156  ghz data collected at the jcmt in may 1990/1992 .",
    "the combined @xmath1  ghz data set of o86 , g93 , and bolocam is well described by a constant brightness ratio of @xmath55 , with a @xmath56 . in this case a linear fit versus year reduces the value of @xmath52 by 0.1 , and a f - test shows that 76% of realizations of constant data would have produced a larger f - ratio .",
    "in addition , the linear fit provides a formal 95% confidence level upper limit of 5.3% on the magnitude of the variation over the 28-year period 1983 to 2010 ( sep latitudes of @xmath11 to @xmath57 ) .",
    "in addition to searching for variations in the brightness ratio of uranus and neptune , we also searched for temporal variations in the brightness of each planet relative to sources that are known to have constant brightnesses , ngc 2071ir and g34.3 @xcite .",
    "six observing runs contained observations of uranus and either ngc 2071ir or g34.3 , and five observing runs contained observations of neptune and either ngc 2071ir or g34.3 .",
    "note that we constrained the brightness ratio of ngc 2071ir and g34.3 based on observations of both objects in february 2010 .",
    "a constant fit of the brightness ratios yields a @xmath52/dof@xmath58 for uranus and a @xmath52/dof@xmath59 for neptune .",
    "we again calculate the f - ratio for a constant fit to the brightness ratios compared to a linear fit versus year and again find that there is not compelling evidence for a linear fit ( 22% of realizations of constant data would have a larger f - ratio than the uranus data and 21% of realizations of constant data would have a larger f - ratio than neptune data ) .",
    "since we are unable to measure any temporal variations in the brightnesses of uranus or neptune , we use the wmap measurements of the brightness temperature of each planet  @xcite , along with our measurement of the brightness ratio ( 1.027 ) to determine the 143  ghz brightness temperature of each planet . in g93 the authors present models for the temperature spectra of each planet based on observations between 90 and 850  ghz , and we have used these models to extrapolate the 94  ghz wmap measurements to 143  ghz .",
    "g93 state that these models are accurate to @xmath60  k when absolute calibration uncertainties are not included , and we have therefore included a 2  k uncertainty in the model - based extrapolation of the absolute 94  ghz wmap measurement to 143  ghz . we find that the brightness temperature of uranus is @xmath61  k and the brightness temperature of neptune is @xmath62  k , where the uncertainties include the wmap and bolocam measurement uncertainties , along with the quoted uncertainties in the g93 models .",
    "these brightness temperatures indicate that the g93 models need to be scaled by @xmath63 ( uranus ) and @xmath64 ( neptune ) . since the g93 brightness models of uranus and neptune were normalized to the martian calibration model described in @xcite ( based on results from @xcite and @xcite ) ,",
    "our results indicate that the @xcite model over - predicts the brightness of mars by @xmath65% .",
    "these scalings are consistent with the results of @xcite , who find that the @xcite model should be scaled by a factor of @xmath66 based on the wmap martian brightness measurements given in @xcite .",
    "ll uranus & @xmath61  k + neptune & @xmath62  k + ngc 2071ir & @xmath67 jy + g34.3 & @xmath68 jy + k3 - 50a & @xmath69 jy [ tab : cals ]    using these absolute brightness temperatures of uranus and neptune , we find peak flux densities per beam of @xmath70  jy ( ngc 2071ir ) , @xmath71  jy ( g34.3 ) , and @xmath72  jy ( k3 - 50a ) for the three secondary calibrators ( see table  [ tab : cals ] ) .",
    "the first value represents our measurement uncertainty on each peak flux density , while the second value represents our 3.3% uncertainty in the brightness temperatures of the planets .",
    "given the source sizes in @xcite , along with bolocam s 59  arcsec fwhm psf , these values should be within 1% of the total flux density for each source .",
    "note that @xcite found the following peak flux densities per 27  arcsec beam for these sources at 150  ghz : @xmath73  jy ( ngc 2071ir ) , @xmath74  jy ( g34.3 ) , and @xmath75  jy ( k3 - 50a ) , where the uncertainties do not include systematic uncertainties in the planet models used to calibrate the data .",
    "our measured peak flux densities are @xmath9% higher for both g34.3 and k3 - 50a ( plus an additional factor of @xmath76% due to the fact that @xcite used the g93 model in order to determine his absolute calibration , which we have found to overestimate the brightness of uranus by @xmath76% ) .",
    "it is not clear why our measured peak flux densities are higher for g34.3 and k3 - 50a , although the known extended emission in both sources , coupled with the fact that @xcite made single - pixel chopped photometry measurements at 27  arcsec resolution , may be the cause .",
    "ghz data from o86 , g93 , and bolocam , the red triangles show 90  ghz data from kr08 , and the green squares show 8.6  ghz data from kl06 ( taken from table 2 of each manuscript and rebinned for visualization ) . ]",
    "we find that uranus and neptune behave as ideal sources for flux calibration at 143  ghz , with no evidence for temporal brightness variations . for uranus ,",
    "these results are in contrast to the lower frequency measurements of kl06 and kr08 , who find @xmath77 percent / year variations in the brightness temperature of uranus at 8.6 and 90  ghz . our data , combined with the measurements of o86 and g93 ,",
    "place a 95% confidence level upper limit of 0.19 percent / year on the magnitude of variations in the brightness temperature of uranus at @xmath1  ghz over the same period .",
    "see figure  [ fig : f2 ] .",
    "a physical interpretation of the temporal variations in the brightness of uranus seen at lower frequencies by kl06 and kr08 , in combination with our static 143  ghz results , is beyond the scope of this manuscript , which is intended to quantify the magnitude and stability of the brightness of uranus for the purposes of using it as a calibrator at 143  ghz .",
    "however , we do note that the combined results are not necessarily inconsistent , given that higher frequency observations of uranus probe higher altitudes in the atmosphere ( kr08 ) .",
    "using bolocam data collected between 2003 and 2010 we have tightly constrained the 143  ghz brightness ratio of uranus and neptune ( @xmath0 ) , and we find no evidence for temporal variations in the 143  ghz brightness temperature of either planet over that period . combining our results with those of o86 and g93 , we find no evidence for 143  ghz brightness variations in either planet over the period from @xmath78 , and place a 95% confidence level upper limit of 5.3% on the magnitude of brightness variations over the 28 year period from 1983 to 2010 . by extrapolating the wmap 94  ghz results given in @xcite to our observing band using the brightness models presented in g93 , we are able to constrain the absolute 143  ghz brightness temperature of each planet to @xmath3% .",
    "additionally , we determine @xmath3% absolute 143  ghz peak flux densities for the ultracompact hii regions g34.3 and k3 - 50a and the protostellar source ngc 2071ir .",
