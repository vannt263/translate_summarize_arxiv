    "the outer solar convection zone extends over 29 % of the solar radius and contains about 2 % of the mass of the sun ( christensen - dalsgaard , gough & thompson 1991 ; kosovichev & fedorova 1991 ) . within most of this region ,",
    "energy transport is dominated by convection , leading to a temperature gradient which only deviates slightly from being adiabatic . in particular ,",
    "the structure of the convection zone is essentially independent of the local value of the opacity .",
    "furthermore , matter is mixed on a time scale of months and hence the composition may be assumed to be uniform . in earlier phases of solar evolution ,",
    "the convection zone has extended considerably more deeply : thus it is normally assumed that the sun was fully convective before arriving on the main sequence , justifying the assumption that the early sun was chemically homogeneous .",
    "motion induced by convection is likely to extend beyond the boundaries of the convection zone .",
    "this can be observed in the solar atmosphere and has a significant effect on the atmospheric structure .",
    "penetration beneath the lower boundary of the convection zone can only be inferred indirectly , but is potentially far more important for overall solar structure and evolution .",
    "it may affect the temperature stratification in the upper parts of the radiative interior and cause mixing and transport of angular momentum , either through direct motion in the form of penetrating convective plumes or through convectively induced gravity waves ( schatzman , these proceedings ; zahn , these proceedings ) .",
    "clear evidence for such mixing is provided by the solar surface abundances of lithium and beryllium which are considerably reduced ( by factors of about 140 and 2 , respectively ; anders & grevesse 1989 ) , relative to the initial composition of the solar system ; this indicates that matter has been mixed to a temperature considerably higher than the maximum temperature at the base of the convectively unstable region during the main - sequence life of the sun .    here",
    "i am concerned with the effects of convection on the spherically symmetric stellar structure and evolution , and how these effects can be investigated through observations of solar oscillations .",
    "many of these issues will be addressed in more detail in later papers in the present volume ; however , i hope to provide a general framework , as well as a basic impression of the data now available for testing the solar models .",
    "gough & weiss ( 1976 ) pointed out that the properties of the convection zone is essentially controlled by the thin , substantially superadiabatic region at its top .",
    "the integral of the superadiabatic gradient over this region determines the adiabat of the nearly adiabatic part of the convection zone and hence its overall structure .",
    "provided the treatment of the superadiabatic region is adjusted , by varying suitable parameters , such as to yield the same adiabat , the overall structure is insensitive to the details of that treatment . here",
    "i consider two simple parametrized treatments of convection .",
    "one is the mixing - length theory of bhm - vitense ( 1958 ; in the following mlt ) , with a mixing length proportional to the pressure scale height .",
    "the second is the formulation by canuto & mazzitelli ( 1991 ; cm ) , with a characteristic scale related to the distance to the top of the convection zone .",
    "a potentially more realistic description of the superadiabatic region can in principle be based on appropriate averages of numerical solutions of the time - dependent hydrodynamical equations of convection .",
    "i shall consider results of simulations carried out by nordlund , stein and trampedach ( stein & nordlund 1989 ; nordlund , these proceedings ; trampedach , these proceedings ) . unlike the simple formulations",
    ", this does not contain explicitly adjustable parameters ; hence it provides a prediction of the adiabat .",
    "an overview of the structure of the solar convection zone is provided by fig .",
    "[ gwcon ] , in a form originally introduced by gough & weiss ( 1976 ) .",
    "this is based mostly on model  s of christensen - dalsgaard ( 1996 ) ; the model was computed with the opal opacity ( iglesias , rogers & wilson 1992 ) and equation of state ( rogers , swenson & iglesias 1996 ) and included settling and diffusion of helium and heavy elements , using coefficients from michaud & proffitt ( 1993 ) .",
    "convection was treated using the mlt . in addition",
    ", the figure shows superadiabatic gradients obtained with the calibrated cm formulation and the hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "it is evident that in all cases the region of substantially superadiabatic convection is restricted to the outer few hundred kilometres of the convection zone .",
    "as illustrated by fig .",
    "[ gwcon ] the region of significant superadiabaticity is extremely thin , compared with the extent of the solar convection zone .",
    "thus the detailed structure of this region matters little insofar as the overall structure of the star is concerned .",
    "however , it provides the transition between the stellar atmosphere and the almost adiabatic bulk of the convection zone .",
    "the structure of the atmosphere can be found observationally , in terms of semi - empirical atmospheric models .",
    "thus the integral over the superadiabatic gradient , which determines the change in specific entropy between the atmosphere and the interior of the convection zone , essentially fixes the adiabat of the adiabatic part of the convection zone .",
    "this , together with the equation of state and composition , largely determines the structure of the convection zone .",
    "the structure of the upper parts of the convection zone is also affected by the dynamical effects of convection , generally represented as a _ turbulent pressure _ ( see rosenthal , these proceedings ; antia & basu , these proceedings ) .",
    "these effects are often neglected in calculations of stellar models , however .",
    "to illustrate the properties of the convection zone it is instructive to consider a highly simplified model .",
    "i assume the equation of state for a fully ionized perfect gas ; then the adiabatic relation between pressure @xmath0 and density @xmath1 can be written as p = k ^ , [ prho ] where @xmath2 and @xmath3 may be assumed to be constant .",
    "neglecting also the mass contained in the convection zone the equation of hydrostatic support is = - g m r^2 , [ hydro ] where @xmath4 is distance to the centre of the star , @xmath5 is the mass of the star and @xmath6 is the gravitational constant . from equations  ( [ prho ] ) and ( [ hydro ] ) one obtains g m ( 1 r - 1 r _ * ) = k^1/ - 1 , [ rsol ] where @xmath7 is the pressure at a point near the top of the convection zone and @xmath8 is the radius at this point , @xmath9 being the surface radius of the star",
    ".    conditions at the base of the convection zone are determined by the transition to convective stability , where matching to the radiative interior fixes the radius @xmath10 and pressure @xmath11 at the convection - zone base .",
    "the condition of marginal convective instability is = , [ constab ] where @xmath12 is the radiation density constant , @xmath13 is the speed of light , @xmath14 is temperature , @xmath15 is luminosity , @xmath16 is opacity , and we neglected again the mass in the convection zone ; also @xmath17 .",
    "this condition , together with equation  ( [ prho ] ) , the equation of state and the dependence of @xmath16 on @xmath0 and @xmath14 , determines the relation between @xmath3 and @xmath11 .",
    "it is most simply analyzed by considering the response of the model to a change @xmath18 in @xmath3 , keeping the other parameters of the model , including mass and composition , fixed .",
    "as confirmed by numerical computations , changes in the convective envelope and outer part of the radiative interior have little effect on the energy - generating core ; thus @xmath15 is largely unchanged and so therefore , according to equation  ( [ constab ] ) , is @xmath19 . using the ideal gas law and equation  ( [ prho ] )",
    "we therefore obtain 0 ( p t^4 ) = _ t - 4 k + 1 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 ; thus - 4 - _ t ( 4 - _ t ) ( - 1 ) - ( _ p + 1 ) k .",
    "[ delpcz ] at the base of the solar convection zone , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "thus , using @xmath24 , we find that @xmath25 .",
    "we may now use equation  ( [ rsol ] ) to find the resulting change in @xmath9 . assuming that @xmath26 and @xmath8",
    ", we have that g m ( 1 - 1 r ) k^1/ - 1 ^1 - 1/ . [ rcz ] the change in @xmath11 evidently causes a change in @xmath10 ; assuming that the hydrostatic structure of the interior , defined by @xmath27 , changes little up to the base of the convection zone , - h_p , [ delrcz ] where @xmath28 is the pressure scale height evaluated at the base of the convection zone . from equation ( [ rcz ] )",
    "it therefore follows that r = - ( r ) ^2 h_p + r ( k^1/ ^1 - 1/ ) , [ delrs ] where @xmath29 is the depth of the convection zone . using again solar values , , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and the relation obtained above between @xmath32 and @xmath33 ,",
    "we find , separating the contributions from the two terms in equation  ( [ delrs ] ) 0.50 k - 0.26 k = 0.24 k , [ delrsnum ] and hence -0.02 k .",
    "[ deldcznum ] it is remarkable , and perhaps surprising , that in the solar case the depth of the convection zone appears to be virtually insensitive to changes in the adiabat of the convection zone , the change in surface radius resulting from the change in the radius at the base of the convection zone . as discussed below , this is confirmed by numerical results for solar models .",
    "note also that @xmath28 is approximately proportional to depth ; thus it is likely that the relative magnitude of the two terms in equation  ( [ delrs ] ) , and hence the sign of the relation in equation  ( [ delrsnum ] ) will be roughly the same for other stars , at least as long as the opacity derivatives do not change substantially .",
    "the dependence of @xmath9 on @xmath3 is used to calibrate solar models to have the observed radius , by adjusting @xmath3 .",
    "this might most simply be achieved by assuming a discontinuity in @xmath1 and @xmath14 at the top of the convection zone such that @xmath3 attains the correct value ( schwarzschild 1958 ) .",
    "however , more commonly a simplified physical description of convection is used , generally containing a parameter which can be adjusted to ensure the correct radius ; this might allow a safer extrapolation from the solar case , where such calibration can be made , to models of other stars where this is rarely possible .",
    "the main features of this calibration can be illustrated by noting that in the deeper part of the convection zone where matter is essentially fully ionized , @xmath3 is related to the specific entropy by s c_p k , [ entropy ] choosing the zero - point of entropy appropriately , where @xmath34 is the specific heat at constant pressure , and @xmath2 was set to @xmath35 .",
    "the value @xmath36 of @xmath37 in adiabatic part of the convection zone is related to the photospheric value @xmath38 by @xmath39 , where s = _ ^p^",
    "* c_p ( - ) p ; [ deltas ] here @xmath40 is a suitable point in the convection zone , such that @xmath41 . assuming that the atmospheric structure is approximately unchanged",
    ", the change in @xmath3 is obtained from the change in @xmath42 as k .",
    "[ delk ] for a given energy flux , @xmath43 is determined by the efficacy of convection in the superadiabatic region : if convective transport becomes more efficient , the superadiabatic gradient is reduced , and so therefore is @xmath42 and hence @xmath3 , which according to equation  ( [ delrsnum ] ) leads to a smaller radius of the model .",
    "several formulations of convection , including the commonly used mixing - length theory , determine the convective efficacy in terms of a characteristic scale @xmath44 , such as the size or mean free path of a convective element .",
    "this is often parametrized as a multiple @xmath45 of a typical length scale in the model , such as the local pressure scale height or the distance to the boundary of the convection zone . in the limit of efficient convection , relevant to the larger part of the solar convection zone",
    ", the convective flux then satisfies @xmath46 .",
    "it follows that if the luminosity , and hence approximately the convective flux , is kept fixed , @xmath47 .",
    "according to equations  ( [ deltas ] ) and ( [ delk ] ) we therefore have that k -2 s c_p - , where the last equality used solar values for @xmath42 ; hence , from equation  ( [ delrsnum ] ) , r -0.24 .",
    "[ delrsal ]      to illustrate the behaviour of convective envelopes discussed in sections 2.1 and 2.2 , i have calculated three static models , based on the composition profile of model  s ( christensen - dalsgaard 1996 ) .",
    "some properties of the models are summarized in table  1 .",
    "models  1 and 2 have been calibrated to solar radius and luminosity by adjusting the convective efficacy and scaling the hydrogen abundance , as a function of mass , by a suitable factor ( christensen - dalsgaard & thompson 1991 ) . in all cases ,",
    "the envelope hydrogen abundance by mass is @xmath48 .",
    "model  1 used a version of the canuto & mazzitelli ( 1991 ) convection formulation , with mixing - length @xmath44 proportional to the distance to the convection - zone boundary , but including a parameter which allows calibration to the precise solar radius .",
    "model  2 used the bhm - vitense mixing - length treatment , with a mixing length @xmath49 proportional to the pressure scale height .",
    "model  3 is also based on the bhm - vitense formulation , but choosing a different mixing length ; the composition is the same as for model  2 .",
    "for these models turbulent pressure was ignored .",
    "in addition , the table lists an envelope model ( model  4 ) obtained by matching to a hydrodynamical simulation , in the manner of trampedach ( these proceedings ) ; convection was treated using mlt , with @xmath45 and a factor in the treatment of turbulent pressure adjusted to obtain a continuous match of pressure and density in the deepest part of the simulation .",
    "thus the adiabat of the deep convection zone is fixed by the properties of the simulation . for this model",
    "the hydrogen abundance is @xmath50 .",
    ".[tab_1 ] properties of static solar models treating convection with the canuto & mazzitelli formulation ( cm ) or the bhm - vitense mixing - length formulation ( mlt ) , as well as an envelope matched continuously to results of hydrodynamical simulation ( sim ) . the radius @xmath9 and @xmath51 of the convection zone",
    "are given in units of the solar radius @xmath52 .",

    "it is evident that the cm formulation leads to a much higher and sharper peak in @xmath43 , with a corresponding strongly confined change in @xmath42 . however , with the calibration to solar radius , the value of the entropy in the adiabatic part of the convection zone , and hence the properties of the interior of the model , are essentially the same in models  1 and 2 , as shown in more detail by the results presented in table  1 .",
    "on the other hand , the decrease in @xmath45 in model  3 , relative to model  2 , causes an increase in @xmath43 , a corresponding increase in @xmath42 and hence an increase in the radius of the model .",
    "the magnitude of the relative change in @xmath9 , 2.3  % , is quite close to what is predicted by the simple approximation  ( [ delrsal ] ) .",
    "also , it should be noticed that the depth @xmath51 of the convection zone has changed little , in accordance with equation  ( [ deldcznum ] ) .",
    "the results for the hydrodynamical simulation , matched to an envelope model , can not be interpreted as simply in terms of the results of sections  2.2 and 2.3 .",
    "equation  ( [ rcz ] ) still holds ; however , since for the envelope model @xmath9 is fixed , the relation defines the change in the depth of the convection zone , as shown in table  1 . in this case",
    "one can not assume that the interior is unaffected by the change in @xmath3 , as was the case for complete models , and hence equation  ( [ delrcz ] ) is no longer valid .",
    "also , because of the difference in composition between models  2 and 4 , say , there is no longer a simple connection between the changes in @xmath42 and @xmath3 .",
    "these questions deserve more careful study than can be attempted here , not least in connection with the calibration , described by trampedach ( these proceedings ) , of the mixing length on the basis of convection simulations .",
    "it should be noticed also that the matched envelope predicts a convection zone extending somewhat more deeply than in the calibrated models , as a result of the different value of @xmath3 .",
    "nevertheless , given the fact that no attempt was made in the simulation to match the solar adiabat , it is encouraging that the change in @xmath3 is relatively modest .",
    "comparisons such as the one attempted here are undoubtedly important tests of simulations of solar convection .",
    "the approximation used in equation  ( [ prho ] ) is only valid if @xmath2 is constant .",
    "however , to the extent that the stratification can be assumed to be adiabatic , @xmath0 and @xmath1 are related by = _ 1 ( p ) _ s , [ prhoad ] where the dependence of @xmath53 on @xmath0 , @xmath1 and composition is determined by the equation of state of the gas .",
    "it follows that the structure of the adiabatic part of the convection zone is entirely specified by the equation of state , the composition and the actual value @xmath36 of the specific entropy .",
    "this property makes the adiabatic part of the convection zone a valuable tool for investigations of the equation of state of stellar material ( christensen - dalsgaard & dppen 1992 ) and forms the basis for helioseismic determinations of the solar envelope helium abundance ( kosovichev 1992 ) .",
    "it is evident that these analyses are possible only to within the accuracy of equation  ( [ prhoad ] ) .",
    "since the thermodynamic effects under consideration are minute , this imposes severe constraints on the superadiabatic gradient .",
    "the behaviour for three different treatments of convection , in relation to the location of the dominant ionization zones , was illustrated in fig .",
    "[ gwcon ] . in the hydrogen and , at least for mlt , the first helium ionization zone @xmath54 , which is comparable with the effects introduced by current uncertainties in the equation of state .",
    "thus investigations of the equation of state have generally been concentrated on the second helium ionization zone , where @xmath43 is at most around @xmath55 in the mlt model . according to the cm formulation , where convective efficiency increases rapidly with depth",
    ", the allowable range might include also the first helium ionization zone .",
    "the hydrodynamical simulations do not extend sufficiently deeply to reach the second helium ionization zone but appear , from fig .",
    "[ gwcon ] , to yield a superadiabatic gradient intermediate between mlt and cm .",
    "these substantial differences indicate that the uncertainty in the treatment of convection might have a significant influence on the degree of adiabaticity even in the second helium ionization zone .",
    "these issues need further investigation , before very detailed tests of the equation of state and/or precise determination of the helium abundance can be carried out .",
    "i finally note that turbulent pressure might also influence tests of the thermodynamic properties of the solar plasma .",
    "for example , the ratio between the turbulent and total pressure at the upper edge of the second helium ionization zone in the mlt model  2 can be estimated as approximately @xmath55 .",
    "this could have significant effects on the relation between @xmath53 , @xmath0 , @xmath1 and composition inferred from helioseismic analyses .",
    "extensive reviews on solar oscillations and their application to helioseismology were given , , by gough & toomre ( 1991 ) , christensen - dalsgaard & berthomieu ( 1991 ) , gough & thompson ( 1991 ) and gough ( 1993 ) .",
    "since i consider only the spherically symmetric structure , the oscillation frequencies @xmath56 depend on the degree @xmath57 and radial order @xmath58 alone .",
    "i shall assume the adiabatic approximation , neglecting the energy gain or loss of the oscillations .",
    "this is an excellent approximation in almost the entire sun but breaks down in the near - surface region where the thermal time scale becomes comparable with the oscillation period . as discussed in detail by rosenthal ( these proceedings ) this region gives rise to other uncertainties in the computation of the frequencies , arising from the physics of the model and the oscillations ; thus in any case the presence of errors in the computed frequencies , arising from the near - surface region , must be kept in mind .",
    "the observed frequencies correspond mostly to acoustic modes .",
    "these are trapped between an upper turning point just below the photosphere and a lower turning point , at a distance @xmath59 from the centre determined by = l + 1/2 , [ lowturn ] where @xmath60 is the adiabatic sound speed .",
    "it follows from equation  ( [ lowturn ] ) that high - degree modes are trapped near the solar surface whereas low - degree modes penetrate into the solar core .",
    "-0.3 cm    perturbation analysis of the oscillation equations ( christensen - dalsgaard & berthomieu 1991 ; see also rosenthal , these proceedings ) shows that the near - surface effects cause changes in the frequencies of the form _",
    "nl^(ns ) = ( _ nl ) q_nl , [ delomns ] for modes of low or moderate degree . here @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the mode energy , normalized by the squared surface amplitude , and @xmath63 is the energy of a radial ( @xmath64 ) mode , interpolated to @xmath56 .",
    "thus the behaviour of @xmath65 reflects the variation of the turning - point radius @xmath59 with the degree of the mode : high - degree modes involve a smaller part of the sun than do low - degree modes and therefore have smaller normalized energy and @xmath65 , hence according to equation  ( [ delomns ] ) making their frequencies more susceptible to the near - surface effects .",
    "@xmath66 is a function of frequency which depends on the physics of the near - surface region ; it may be shown that if the errors in the calculation are confined extremely close to the surface , @xmath67 is a slowly varying function of @xmath68 which is small at low frequency .",
    "equation  ( [ delomns ] ) motivates analyzing frequency differences in terms of @xmath69 .",
    "this scaling effectively reduces the frequency change resulting from near - surface effects to the equivalent change for a radial mode , by taking out the dependence on the penetration depth .",
    "thus if differences in structure were confined exclusively to the near - surface region , we might expect @xmath70 to depend on frequency alone , for modes of low or moderate @xmath57 for which the motion in the surface layers is almost radial .",
    "these principles may be illustrated by comparing models  1 and 2 computed with the cm and mlt treatments of convection and , according to fig .",
    "[ superad ] , differing only very near the surface .",
    "figure  [ condiff]a shows differences , at fixed mass , between these models ; as discussed by christensen - dalsgaard & thompson ( 1996 ) the effects of near - surface model changes are most naturally represented in terms of such differences .",
    "it is evident that the change in the model is essentially confined to the superadiabatic region where the temperature gradients differ substantially .",
    "unscaled and scaled frequency differences between these two models are shown in panels ( b ) and ( c ) of fig .",
    "[ condiff ] .",
    "the unscaled differences show a fairly substantial dependence on degree which is largely suppressed by the scaling , except at high degree .",
    "-0.7 cm    it is convenient to relate frequency differences between two models , or between the sun and a model , to the corresponding differences in structure .",
    "this is generally done on the assumption that the differences are sufficiently small that the relation is linear .",
    "asymptotic theory for acoustic modes then shows that ( christensen - dalsgaard , gough & prez hernndez 1988 ) s_nl _ nl _ nl = ( _ nl l+1/2 ) + ( _ nl ) , [ diffduv ] where @xmath71 is closely related to the scaling @xmath65 introduced in equation  ( [ delomns ] ) , ( w ) = _ ^r ( 1-c^2 ) ^-1/2 _ r ccrc , [ diffduv - h ] and the function @xmath72 contains contributions from the near - surface region , including the uncertain aspects of the physics . in equation  ( [ diffduv - h ] )",
    "the difference @xmath73 is evaluated at fixed radius @xmath4 .",

    "this suggests that the differences between the sun and the model are dominated by the near - surface effects .",
    "indeed , the shape and magnitude of the differences are rather similar to the differences , shown in fig .",
    "[ condiff ] , between the cm and mlt models .",
    "this might suggest that the cm formulation may be a more accurate representation of the uppermost layers of the solar convection zone ( patern 1993 ) ; however , as discussed by rosenthal ( these proceedings ) this conclusion may be premature , given the other potential near - surface contributions to the frequency differences .",
    "equation  ( [ diffduv ] ) indicates that the relative frequency differences can be separated into a contribution depending on frequency and a contribution depending on @xmath74 or , equivalently , the turning - point radius @xmath59 .",

    "the most striking feature is the rapid variation for modes whose turning points are near @xmath75 , , close to the base of the convection zone .",
    "according to equation  ( [ diffduv - h ] ) this suggests that there is a comparatively large component of the sound - speed difference at this point ; as we shall see in the next section , this is in fact the case .",
    "to investigate the causes of the residual frequency differences shown in fig .",

    "a second substantial feature is the dip in @xmath86 around @xmath87 , , at the edge of the nuclear - burning core , apparently followed by a rise in the deeper parts of the core . in the convection zone",

    "[ xprof ] : beneath the convection zone the accumulation of helium settling out of the convection zone causes a sharp gradient in @xmath93 , whereas hydrogen burning , with an additional small contribution from helium settling , leads to a strong variation of @xmath93 in the core . in both cases , the difference between the solar and model sound speed could be reduced by smoothing the composition profile : this would increase @xmath93 , reduce @xmath89 and hence increase @xmath60 just below the convection zone and similarly reduce @xmath93 and @xmath60 at the edge of the core , with a corresponding increase in the inner core .    to test this possibility , bruntt ( 1996 ) adjusted the hydrogen profile in model  s in such a way as to approximate the sound - speed difference shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : delcinv ] .",
    "the profiles were constrained to correspond to the same total amount of hydrogen as for model  s , to within 0.5 % , and to give the observed solar luminosity ; however , no assumptions were made about possible physical mechanisms which might cause the redistribution of hydrogen .",
    "the resulting profile is shown in fig .",
    "[ xprof ] as a dashed line , and the difference in sound speed between the modified model and model  s was shown as the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : delcinv ] .",
    "evidently the change in composition has reproduced much of the sound - speed difference between the sun and the model .",
    "evidence for a smoother composition profile just below the convection zone was also found from inverse analysis by antia & chitre ( 1996 ) .",
    "such changes in composition are not implausible .",
    "indeed , as mentioned in the introduction , the depletion of lithium and beryllium demonstrates that mixing in the sun well below the convection zone must have taken place at some stage during solar main - sequence evolution .",
    "computations with rotationally - induced mixing accounting for the lithium depletion ( chaboyer 1995 ; richard 1996 ; see also zahn , these proceedings ) have largely succeeded in eliminating the bump in the sound - speed difference just below the convection zone ( gough 1996 ) . mixing would also be caused by convective penetration into the stable region ; even a very small fraction of convective eddies penetrating to a substantial distance could cause appreciable mixing , with little effect on the temperature structure .",
    "it has furthermore been suggested that gravity waves excited by convective penetration might lead to mixing ( montalbn 1994 ; montalbn & schatzman 1996 ; see also schatzman , these proceedings ) .",
    "it should be noted that the lithium depletion and change in the hydrogen profile are not automatically related : thus strong mixing in the early phases of solar evolution , as might have been caused by rotation , could have depleted lithium with little effect on the present hydrogen profile . in this sense , the information obtained from lithium and from the sound - speed inversion is complementary .",
    "unfortunately , mixing is not the only mechanism that might account for the sound - speed results .",
    "early mass loss ( guzik & cox 1995 ) might also reduce the lithium and beryllium abundances , and in addition improve the agreement with the inferred solar sound speed just below the convection zone ( gough 1996 ) . furthermore , it is obviously possible to change the sound speed by changing the temperature profile .",
    "this requires modifications to the opacity such that the condition of radiative energy transport is satisfied .",
    "tripathy , basu & christensen - dalsgaard ( 1996 ) showed that the inferred sound - speed difference in fig .",
    "[ fig : delcinv ] can be reproduced by means of a suitably chosen opacity modification of only a few per cent . thus independent information and ,",
    "if possible , tighter constraints on the opacity are required to separate the different possible causes for the remaining differences between the sun and solar models .",
    "the results of inversion for the sound - speed difference , such as those shown in fig .  [ fig : delcinv ] , indicate a strikingly close agreement between the solar sound speed and that of normal solar models .",
    "this has little implication for the dynamics of the upper parts of the convection zone which have been adjusted , by calibration of the mixing length , to produce a model with the correct radius ; however , it does indicate that conditions at and below the base of the convection zone are not vastly different from those obtained from normal stellar modelling ( see also roxburgh , these proceedings ) .",
    "nonetheless , the most dramatic sound - speed difference does in fact occur in this region .",
    "although various explanations are possible , the most plausible of these is perhaps mixing induced by rotational instability , direct convective penetration or gravity waves .",
    "however , it is important to stress that , despite its great power , helioseismology can not on its own provide a full investigation of the problems of mixing in stellar interiors .",
    "this requires a combination of a better physical understanding of the mixing processes , data from other stars on , for example , the lithium depletion ( michaud & charbonneau 1991 ) , and tighter constraints on other aspects of the physics of the radiative interior , such as the opacity .",
    "it is encouraging that the hydrodynamical simulations discussed here result in a structure of the adiabatic part of the convection zone fairly close to that obtained in calibrated parametrized models .",
    "this offers some hope that such simulations might be used to provide a firmer extrapolation to other stars than the commonly used assumption of a constant mixing - length parameter ( ludwig , freytag & steffen , these proceedings ; trampedach , these proceedings ) .",
    "tests of such extrapolations might be provided by well - observed binary stars , such as the @xmath94 cen system ( edmonds 1992 ; fernandes & neuforge 1995 ) .",
    "observations of solarlike oscillations in these or other stars might clearly be extremely valuable in constraining the models , in terms of the properties of convection or other aspects of the structure .",
    "when such data are available , the meaning of the `` s '' in the title of subsequent conferences in this series might be subtly changed .",
    "i am grateful to hans bruntt for permission to show the results of the modified hydrogen profile in figs  [ fig : delcinv ] and [ xprof ] , to regner trampedach for the matched envelope and hydrodynamical simulation and to mario monteiro for the implementation of the cm formalism .",
    "colin rosenthal is thanked for comments on an earlier version of the paper .",
    "this work was supported by the danish national research foundation through its establishment of the theoretical astrophysics center .",
