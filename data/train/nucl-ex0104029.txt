    "the model parameters are taken from @xmath66dy ( see table i ) as a typical set applicable for rare earth nuclei . in order to calculate the thermodynamical quantities up to @xmath67 mev , at least 10 broken nucleon pairs have to be incorporated .",

    "mev the nuclei are excited to energies comparable to their respective neutron binding energies .",
    "the even - even , odd and odd - odd systems have different excitation energies at one and the same temperature , where the even - even system requires the highest @xmath65 value .",
    "the entropy @xmath16 and heat capacity @xmath18 represent first and second derivatives of @xmath64 , and are thus more sensible to thermal changes .",

    "the lower right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sfecdemo ] shows the typical s - shape of the heat capacity . as this shape is an important fingerprint for pairing transitions in nuclei @xcite , we will in the following focus on its origin .",

    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scdemo ] for the even - even system , where the components of particle , rotational , and vibrational degrees of freedom are displayed .",
    "the collective contribution to the entropy @xmath16 is small and fairly constant with increasing temperature .",
    "however , one should note that @xmath78 is in fact the main component at the lowest temperatures with @xmath79 mev .",
    "for the total entropy and heat capacity , also the effect of the number of pairs is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scdemo ] .",
    "the @xmath18 curves are identical for 6 and 10 pairs up to @xmath80 mev , but from there on the 6 pair system is exhausted and not able to absorb energy at the same rate as when more cooper pairs are present .",
    "the figure shows that the s shape can be evaluated rather accurately without taking very many pairs into account . on the other hand ,",
    "if too few pairs are included , one may easily misinterpret the shape of the @xmath18 curve .",
    "for the @xmath66dy mass region , 6 cooper pairs are sufficient to determine the s shape .",
    "figure [ fig : cn01 ] shows the heat capacity ( upper panels ) and the corresponding number of unpaired particles ( lower panels ) for 10 pairs of nucleons . in the left panels a realistic pairing gap parameter of @xmath81 mev has been chosen .",
    "we identify three temperature regions of interest : ( i ) the @xmath82 mev region with different s shapes for even - even , odd and odd - odd - systems , ( ii ) the fermi gas regime with @xmath83 mev , exhibiting the same linear heat capacity for the three systems and ( iii ) the dramatical change for @xmath84 mev due to the final number of particles in the systems .    the pronounced @xmath18 maximum at @xmath85 mev is due the low number of available cooper pairs ; the lower left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : cn01 ] shows that @xmath86 nucleons are already unpaired at this temperature . as @xmath87 , we find @xmath88 20 , 21 and 22 for the even - even , odd and odd - odd systems , respectively .",
    "this corresponds to the situation where all pairs are broken , giving a @xmath18-value equal to the total number of nucleons in the system .",
    "since a system with one particle in an infinite harmonic oscillator gives @xmath89 for @xmath90 and the effective pauli blocking between the nucleons is negligible , we obtain @xmath91 .    in the right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : cn01 ] , the pairing gap is reduced to @xmath92 mev . now the s shape of the @xmath18 curve can be seen to vanish in the @xmath93 limit , telling that the s shape is connected with the pairing strength .",
    "furthermore , we see that the heat capacity reaches a maximum level of @xmath94 at lower temperature @xmath80 mev . at this point",
    "the remaining number of particles bound in cooper pairs is low , and the depairing mechanism again looses its capability to create more heat capacity .",
    "it might be surprising though that the number of depaired particles does not increase much faster with temperature .",
    "the answer to this is that in our model , not only the energy @xmath46 is required to break up a pair , but also the unpaired particles have to be placed into the single - particle level scheme at some finite energy @xmath95 , since the pauli blocking prevents them to populate the lowest levels in the single - particle level scheme , which are all occupied by other unpaired nucleons .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : pairexemp ] an interpretation of the s shape is given for the even - even system .",
    "in the left panel , a `` background '' is subtracted from @xmath18 , using a straight line through 0.3 and 0.9 mev of temperature .",
    "this line is intended to mimic the underlying heat capacity originating from a fermi gas type of system .",
    "however , the gas properties are strongly connected to the depairing process , and the subtracted peak in the lower left panel should be taken with care .",
    "the resulting peak shows some resemblance with the schottky anomaly , which describes a particle placed in a two level system @xcite .",
    "however , the maximum heat capacity of such a model is @xmath96 at a temperature of 40% of the energy gap between the levels .",
    "for atomic nuclei , we may define a similar , but extended schottky model : either no pairs are broken at excitation energy @xmath97 , or one pair is broken at @xmath98 , or two pairs are broken at @xmath99 and so on .",
    "this picture is an extreme simplification , and we include here only zero , one and two pairs . thus , our schottky - like partition function reads @xmath100 the multiplicities in front of the boltzmann factors represent the number of levels at @xmath98 and @xmath99 and are estimated from experimental data using @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is the level density and @xmath103 is the energy window considered .    in the right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : pairexemp ] @xmath18 is evaluated by the use of eq .",
    "( [ eq : schottky ] ) for @xmath66dy .",
    "the @xmath102 values are estimated from table i of ref .",
    "@xcite . with an energy window of @xmath104 mev",
    ", we obtain @xmath105 and @xmath106 ; numbers which are also consistent with the numbers of seniority @xmath107 2 and 4 states in the model of ref .",
    "the high multiplicities give a strength , width , and position of the peak that compare qualitatively well with the peak in the lower left panel . from this comparison ,",
    "we interpret the local maximum of the s - shaped @xmath18 curve at @xmath108 mev as the point at which the depairing process is at the strongest .",
    "hence , we define this point as the critical temperature @xmath2 for the pairing transition",
    ".    to close this section , we comment on the weakening of the s shape when going from even - even to odd and odd - odd systems ; an effect which is clearly seen in the lower right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sfecdemo ] .",
    "the reason for the weakening can be understood from the entropy plot displayed in the right upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sfecdemo ] .",
    "there , we saw that the entropy of each valence nucleon is reduced from a value of @xmath109 at @xmath110 mev to zero at @xmath111 mev .",
    "since the corresponding heat capacity relates to @xmath112 , a negative contribution to @xmath18 appears and a quenching of the amplitude of the s - curve is apparent .",
    "our model is described within the canonical ensemble , while experimental data refer to the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "however , there are two ways to compare our model with experiments . with a known experimental level density @xmath102",
    ", the partition function can be constructed from @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the excitation energy and @xmath115 are the energy bins used . from this partition function",
    "all thermodynamical quantities can be deduced , see e.g.  eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ft]-[eq : cv ] ) .",
    "the drawback of this method , is that the level density function has to be known up to high excitation energies , typically @xmath116 mev .",
    "the other way is to evaluate the microcanonical level density from our canonical model .",
    "this can be performed by an inverse laplace transformation of @xmath14 . using the saddle - point approximation ( fawler - darwin method ) , we obtain@xcite @xmath117 the level density can then be compared with certain experimental values , and complete knowledge on the level density up to high excitation energies is not necessary .",
    "one drawback using the saddle - point approximation is that the excitation energy @xmath17 is a thermal average with a large standard variation of @xmath118 , with @xmath71 being the level - density parameter .",
    "a second drawback is the approximation itself , which we have tested by a `` forward - backward '' laplace transformation . in fig .",
    "[ fig : laplace ] we compare the original entropy and heat capacity , with the ones obtained by using eq .",
    "( [ eq : rho ] ) to obtain @xmath102 , and then using eq .",
    "( [ eq : laplace ] ) to obtain a new @xmath14 and its corresponding @xmath16 and @xmath18",
    ". the comparison reveals a general smoothing for temperatures @xmath119 mev .",
    "the entropy is seen to be reproduced rather well , however , the heat capacity is more sensitive to the approximation .    the model presented in sec .",
    "ii rests on the assumption that the single - particle level scheme can be approximated by equidistant levels .",
    "this assumption is never fulfilled in atomic nuclei , but within the canonical ensemble , the various deduced thermodynamical quantities are strongly smoothed with respect to excitation energy .",
    "therefore , even with some non - uniformity , the model might still give realistic results .",
    "probably , heavy and strongly deformed nuclei are the best candidates for our model .    for test cases",

    ", @xmath25 is chosen as a free parameter , determined from a fit to known experimental level densities .",
    "for each nucleus we adopt two level density anchor points , as deduced in ref .",
    "the lower anchor point is based on the counting of known discrete levels .",
    "this method is rather accurate , except for the odd - odd nuclei , where the number of levels might be several hundred per mev , and thus difficult to measure .",
    "the other anchor point is based on average neutron - resonance spacing data at the neutron - binding energy .",

    ", we may now calculate the heat capacity @xmath18 from our model and compare with experiments .",
    "due to the imperfection of the saddle - point approximation , we take @xmath129 from the saddle - point approximation ( which is tuned to experiments in fig .",
