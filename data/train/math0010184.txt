    "firstly we reduce to the case when the smooth part of the orbifold is hyperbolic .",
    "we view the ( complete ) hyperbolic structure on the smooth part as a hyperbolic cone structure on the orbifold with cone angles zero .",

    "next we consider a sequence of hyperbolic cone structures on the orbifold whose cone angles converge to the supremum of the cone angles in the deformation space .",
    "we have the following dichotomy : either the sequence collapses ( i.e. the supremum of the injectivity radius for each cone structure goes to zero ) or not ( i.e. each cone structure contains a point with injectivity radius uniformly bounded away from zero .    in the _ non - collapsing _ case we show in section  [ sec : deg ] that the orbifold angles can be reached in the deformation space of hyperbolic cone structures , and therefore the orbifold is hyperbolic .",
    "this step uses a _ stability theorem _ which shows that a non - collapsing sequences of hyperbolic cone structures on the orbifold has a subsequence converging to a hyperbolic cone structure on the orbifold .",
    "we prove this theorem in section  [ sec : noncollapse ] .",
    "then we analyze the case where the sequence of cone structures collapses .",
    "if the diameters of the collapsing cone structures are bounded away from zero , then we conclude that the orbifold is seifert fibred , using the _ fibration theorem _ which is proved in section [ sec : seifert ] .",
    "otherwise the diameter of the sequence of cone structures converges to zero .",
    "then we show that the orbifold is geometric , unless the following situation occurs : the orbifold is closed and admits a euclidean cone structure with cone angles strictly less than its orbifold angles .",
    "we deal with this last case in sections  [ sec : sphericaluniformization ] and [ sec : sphericalcone ] prove that then the orbifold is spherical ( _ spherical uniformization _ theorem ) . for orbifolds with cyclic or dihedral stabilizer ,",
    "the proof relies on hamilton s theorem @xcite about the ricci flow on 3-manifolds . in the general case",
