    "most planets are observed only indirectly , through their influence on their host star .",
    "the planet properties we infer therefore strongly depend on how well we know those of the stars .",
    "our ability to determine the surface gravity ( @xmath1 ) of field stars , however , is notoriously limited : broadband photometry , while efficient , yields errors of @xmath00.5 dex ; spectroscopy suffers from well known degeneracies between @xmath1 , @xmath2and metallicity @xcite while having @xmath1  errors of 0.10.2 dex @xcite ; and asteroseismology , the gold standard for stellar parameter estimation with @xmath1  errors of @xmath00.01 dex @xcite , is time and resource intensive and , particularly for dwarfs , is limited to the brightest stars .",
    "meanwhile , high precision photometric surveys like corot and _ kepler _ have surveyed over @xmath0200 000 sun - like stars in their hunt for exoplanets , revealing stellar variations that have previously only been robustly observed in the sun and a handful of bright sun - like stars  and also variations that were previously unknown but , as we show , encode a simple measure of stellar @xmath1 . in what follows ,",
    "i describe our analysis of the newly unveiled high frequency photometric variations , which we term `` flicker '' ( or @xmath3 ) and which enable us to measure @xmath1  with an accuracy of @xmath00.1  dex .",
    "i summarize our work thus far in using @xmath3  to study granulation in sun - like stars , to examine the impact of granulation in radial velocity planet detection , and to improve size estimates of transiting exoplanets .",
    "using light curves from nasa s _ kepler _ mission , we discovered that stellar @xmath1  reveals itself through @xmath3 a measure of photometric variations on timescales of @xmath4 8hr  and may hence be used to measure @xmath1  with errors of @xmath00.1 dex , even for stars too faint for asteroseismology ( * ? ? ? * fig .",
    "[ fig : bastien13 ] ) .",
    "the measurement of @xmath1  from @xmath3  only requires the discovery light curves , and this measurement not only yields a result with an accuracy that rivals spectroscopy , it also does so very quickly and efficiently , requiring only a simple routine that can be executed by anyone in just a few seconds per star .",
    "stellar surface gravity manifests in a simple measure of brightness variations .",
    "asteroseismically determined @xmath1  shows a tight correlation with @xmath3 .",
    "color represents the amplitude of the stars brightness variations ; outliers tend to have large brightness variations . excluding these outliers , a cubic - polynomial fit through the kepler stars and through the sun ( large star symbol ) shows a median absolute deviation of 0.06  dex and a r.m.s .",
    "deviation of 0.10  dex . to simulate how the solar @xmath1  would appear in data we use to measure @xmath1  for other stars",
    ", we divide the solar data into 90-d `` quarters '' .",
    "our @xmath3@xmath1  relation measured over multiple quarters then yields a median solar @xmath1  of 4.442 with a median absolute deviation of 0.005  dex and a r.m.s .",
    "error of 0.009  dex ( the true solar @xmath1  is 4.438 ) . from @xcite . ]    in @xcite , we ascribed @xmath3  to granulation power , which is known to depend on the stellar @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "recent independent simulations and asteroseismic studies have examined the expected photometric manifestations of granulation @xcite , nominally through the fourier spectrum from which it can be difficult to extract the granulation signal .",
    "we used the simulations to predict the granulation - driven @xmath3 , and we find excellent agreement with our observed @xmath3 , demonstrating that the @xmath3  is indeed granulation - driven @xcite .",
    "we also determined an empirical correction to the granulation models , particularly for f stars which have the shallowest convective outer layers .",
    "indeed , our results suggest that these models must include the effects of the magnetic suppression of convection in f stars in order to reproduce the observations .",
    "this work can ultimately help to develop our technique of `` granulation asteroseismology , '' enabling the precise determination of a larger number of stellar , and hence planetary , parameters .",
    "the speed and efficiency with which one can determine accurate @xmath1  solely with the discovery light curves translates directly into a rapid assessment of the distribution of bulk planet properties  in particular , with greater accuracy and fewer telescopic and computational resources than similar studies @xcite that of necessity relied on broadband photometric measurements to determine stellar properties .",
    "we therefore applied our @xmath3  technique to a few hundred bright ( _ kepler _ magnitudes between 8 and 13 ) planet candidates in the _ kepler _ field , and we find that these stars are significantly more evolved than previous studies suggest @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the planet radii are 2030% larger than previously estimated .",
    "in addition , we find that the high proportion of subgiants we derive ( 48% ) is consistent with predictions from galactic models of the underlying stellar population ( 45% ) , whereas previous analyses heavily bias stellar parameters towards the main sequence and hence yield a low subgiant fraction ( 27% ; figs .  [ fig : bastien14b_1],[fig : bastien14b_2 ] ) .",
    "distributions of @xmath1  for the trilegal simulated sample ( black ) and koi host stars with @xmath3-based @xmath1  ( red ) and broadband photometry / spectroscopy - based @xmath1  ( `` nea '' ; cyan curve ) .",
    "we limit the @xmath2  range here to 47006500  k , for which the _ kepler _ targets should be representative of the field .",
    "vertical lines indicate the range of @xmath1  corresponding to subgiants .",
    "we find that @xmath3  reproduces the expected underlying distribution , and , in particular , recovers the expected population of subgiants , while the nea parameters are preferentially pushed towards the main sequence . adapted from @xcite . ]",
    "h - r diagram of koi host stars with @xmath1  derived from @xmath3  ( middle ) and broadband photometry / spectroscopy ( bottom ) , and as predicted by a trilegal @xcite simulation ( top ) .",
    "colored curves represent the theoretical evolutionary tracks ( masses labeled in m@xmath5 ) . vertical lines demarcate the range of stellar @xmath2considered in this study .",
    "the horizontal lines demarcate the range of @xmath1  for subgiants ( 3.5 @xmath4 @xmath1  @xmath4 4.1 ) .",
    "a representative error bar on @xmath1  for each stellar sample is in the upper right of each panel .",
    "we find that the @xmath3-based @xmath1  distribution more closely matches expectation than previous @xmath1  measurements , particularly in the subgiant domain , perhaps because @xmath3involves no main - sequence prior on the @xmath3-based @xmath1  values . from @xcite . ]",
    "we expand upon this work by tailoring our initial @xmath3  relation to be more directly useful to the exoplanet community by deriving a relationship between @xmath3  and stellar density @xcite .",
    "this relation , which can yield the stellar density with an uncertainty of @xmath030% , can help to constrain exoplanet eccentricities and enable the application of techniques like astrodensity profiling to hundreds of exoplanet host stars in the _ kepler _ field alone .",
    "rv planet detection , particularly of small planets , requires precise doppler measurements , and only a few instruments are able to achieve the precision needed to observe them .",
    "key to the success of rv planet campaigns is the avoidance of `` rv loud '' stars  those likely to exhibit large levels of rv jitter that can impede and sometimes even mimic planetary signals @xcite .",
    "most rv surveys therefore focus their attention on magnetically quiet stars , as magnetic spots tend to drive the largest amount of rv jitter .",
    "nonetheless , magnetically inactive stars can exhibit unexpectedly high levels of rv jitter @xcite , and even low jitter levels can impede the detection of small planets .",
    "the drivers of rv jitter in inactive stars remain elusive @xcite , continuing to plague rv planet detection and , in the case of f dwarfs , resulting in the outright avoidance of whole groups of notoriously rv noisy stars , even in transit surveys with large ground - based follow - up efforts like _ kepler _ @xcite .",
    "comparison between rv jitter ( rv rms ) and @xmath3-based @xmath1 : rv jitter shows a strong anti - correlation with @xmath3-based @xmath1 , with a statistical confidence of 97% derived from a survival analysis .",
    "a similar trend was found by @xcite .",
    "@xmath3  measures granulation power @xcite , indicating that the rv jitter of magnetically inactive stars is driven by convective motions on the stellar surface whose strength increases as stars evolve . adapted from @xcite . ]",
    "given the breadth of stellar photometric behavior newly revealed by ultra - high precision light curves , and the new insights that they are giving into stellar surface processes , we compared different ways of characterizing this photometric behavior with rv jitter for all stars with both ultra - high precision light curves and high precision , long term rv monitoring @xcite .",
    "these stars have very low photometric amplitudes ( less than 3 ppt ) , a previously unexplored regime of both photometric variability and rv jitter .",
    "we find that the rv jitter of these stars , ranging from 3  m  s@xmath6 to 135  m  s@xmath6 , manifests in the light curve fourier spectrum , which we then use to develop an empirical predictor of rv jitter .",
    "we also find that spot models grossly under - predict the observed jitter by factors of 21000 . finally , we demonstrate that @xmath3  itself is a remarkably clean predictor of rv jitter in magnetically quiet stars ( fig .  [",
    "fig : bastien14a ] ) , suggesting that the observed jitter is driven by convective motions on the stellar surface and is strongly tied to @xmath1 .",
    "we find that surface convection in cool stars manifests as the high frequency `` flicker '' observed in high precision , long time - baseline light curves , such as those from _",
    "kepler_. we show that it yields a simple measure of stellar surface gravity and density , and we use it to place empirical constraints on granulation models .",
    "we use it to perform an ensemble analysis of exoplanet host stars , finding that the exoplanet radii are larger than previous studies suggested .",
    "finally , we find that it is a clean predictor of rv jitter in magnetically inactive stars and can hence be used to identify promising targets for rv follow - up campaigns and rv planet searches .",
    "more generally , we show that stellar variability  traditionally considered a major noise source and nuisance , particularly in exoplanet detection  can be used to enhance both exoplanet science and our understanding of stellar evolution ."
