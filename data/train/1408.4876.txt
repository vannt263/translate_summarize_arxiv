    "each weyl node behaves as a magnetic monopole in the momentum space , which acts as the source / drain for the berry curvature field  @xcite .",
    "it has been predicted that this nontrivial momentum - space topology of weyl nodes gives rise to a number of novel electromagnetic responses@xcite . on the material side ,",
    "weyl sms have been proposed for strongly correlated iridates  @xcite , semiconductor heterostructures @xcite , and other materials @xcite .",
    "in addition , 3d dirac materials have recently been realized in both cd@xmath0as@xmath1 @xcite and na@xmath0bi @xcite , which could greatly facilitate the search for weyl sms .",
    "a remarkable phenomenon associated with weyl nodes is the so - called chiral anomaly @xcite , in which the application of a pair of parallel electric field @xmath2 and magnetic field @xmath3 induces a charge imbalance between the two weyl nodes with opposite chirality .",
    "this chiral anomaly can be utilized to detect 3d weyl sms in experiments .",
    "for example , a large longitudinal magnetoconductivity was proposed as a consequence of the chiral anomaly @xcite , which , however , is difficult to identify unambiguously in magnetotransport data @xcite .",
    "recently , nonlocal transport @xcite , optical conductivity @xcite , and optical absorption @xcite measurements have also been proposed to probe the chiral anomaly in 3d weyl sms .    in this paper",

    "we show that the chiral anomaly would lead to a different plasmon mode in intrinsic weyl sms .",
    "the chiral anomaly causes a redshift of the frequency of plasmon mode in doped weyl sms .",
    "once the small fermi surface crosses the weyl node that corresponds to the lifshitz transition ( lt ) point , the frequency turns out to be a violetshift .",

    "[ sec : conclusions ] , we summarize the main results of this paper . finally , in appendixes [ sec : appendixa ] and [ sec : appendixb ] we give details of the calculation of the free polarization function .",
    "we begin with a low - energy effective hamiltonian for weyl fermions in the vicinity of the weyl node of chirality @xmath4 , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the fermi velocity , @xmath7 refers to the three pauli matrices , and @xmath8 stands for the chirality - dependent chemical potential given by a superposition of the equilibrium carrier density and the pumped carrier density originating from the chiral anomaly .",
    "the latter grows linearly with time , but the large momentum internode scattering would counteract this imbalance of carriers between two weyl nodes . eventually the system reaches a nonequilibrium steady state characterized by an internode relaxation time @xmath9 that had been evaluated microscopically  @xcite .",
    "consequently , the density of electrons pumped into or out of the neighborhood of weyl node @xmath10 can be expressed as @xcite @xmath11 we also define several chirality - dependent quantities : the fermi wave vector @xmath12 , the chemical potential @xmath13 , and the charge density @xmath14 . when the two weyl nodes are equally populated , the corresponding fermi wave vector and the chemical potential become @xmath15 , @xmath16 . for convenience ,",
    "we restrict our discussion to @xmath17 . for the undoped case with vanishing equilibrium chemical potential , @xmath8 depends only on the pumped charge associated with the chiral anomaly , @xmath18 meanwhile , for the doped case with a finite chemical potential @xmath19 , we obtain the corresponding chirality - dependent chemical potential as @xmath20 where we have introduced a dimensionless ratio between the pumped charge and the equilibrium charge , @xmath21 it follows from eq .   that by tuning the external fields the system undergoes a chirality - dependent lt at @xmath22 , i.e. , the change of the topology of the chirality - dependent fermi surface . in the following",
    "we shall work in the weak magnetic field limit @xcite , thus neglecting the landau level structure of weyl nodes @xcite .",
    "in addition , we will focus on the @xmath23-doped case with a finite positive equilibrium chemical potential @xmath24 throughout this paper ( the discussion of the @xmath25doped case is similar ) .",
    "it has been demonstrated that no plasmon exists in dirac sms @xcite or undoped weyl sms @xcite within the random phase approximation ( rpa ) . however , when the chiral anomaly occurs , the anomalous charge transfer between the two weyl nodes forces the fermi surfaces to move away from their equilibrium position in opposite directions as shown in fig .",
