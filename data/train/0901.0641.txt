    "the formation of s0 galaxies is generally discussed in the framework of mergers of disk galaxies within a lambda cold dark matter ( @xmath4cdm ) cosmology . alternatively , they can be viewed as former spirals where star formation has ceased and gas lost by stripping mechanisms . however , less attention has been paid to the role of bars in the evolution of these galaxies .",
    "bars are known to be efficient drivers of gas towards the central regions of galaxies , and in the presence of nuclear bars @xcite or nuclear spirals , a central starburst might occur .",
    "numerical simulations @xcite also predict that bars evolve due to angular momentum transfer between the bar and a massive or centrally concentrated halo , leading to more prominent bars .",
    "indeed , there is observational evidence that bars in early - type disk galaxies might be more evolved than bars in spiral galaxies .",
    "they are longer @xcite , more massive , and have more frequently double - peaked fourier amplitude profiles @xcite and ansae - type morphologies @xcite . in the above simulation models",
    "these features can be interpreted as indices of evolved bars .",
    "lenses are features commonly observed in s0 galaxies , but are sometimes also seen in early - type spirals .",
    "they are defined as components with a shallow or constant surface brightness profile , and a sharp outer edge .",
    "lenses are a fundamental part of the original classification of s0s @xcite , although they were not recognized initially with their own type symbol .",
    "ovals are global deviations of the disk from the axisymmetric shape . in distinction to bars they have lower ellipticities and generally lack higher order fourier terms than @xmath5=2 .",
    "we emphasize the importance of ovals and lenses for understanding bar - induced galaxy evolution .",
    "@xcite showed that 54@xmath3 of barred galaxies of types sb0-sba have lenses .",
    "the actual frequency of lenses in non - barred s0s was not determined at that time , although strong lenses were known to exist in such galaxies @xcite .",
    "our recent studies ( laurikainen et al . 2005 , 2007 ) have confirmed that lenses are common in non - barred s0s .",
    "it was first suggested by @xcite that lenses might be destroyed or weakened bars . if bars evolve in the hubble sequence , and lenses are indeed weakened bars , at some stage one would expect the fraction of lenses to exceed the fraction of bars .",
    "it is also challenging to explain the origin of the multiple bars , ovals and lenses seen in single s0s and for which no explanation has yet been given in the current paradigm of galaxy formation . in this letter",
    "the origin of s0 galaxies is discussed , based on an analysis of 127 early - type disk galaxies ( laurikainen et al .",
    "2005 , 2006 ) : n(s0)=82 , n(s0/a)=18 , n(sa - sab)=27 .",
    "although by far most s0s might be descendants of spiral galaxies , we present evidence that bars , ovals and lenses have played an important role in their structure formation and evolution .",
    "support for the stripped spiral hypothesis is provided by a clear correlation between bulge and disk scale parameters ( section 4 ) .",
    "the role of bars in structure formation is evidenced by the large number of ovals+lenses ( interpreted as weakened bars ) in s0s , and by the massive disk - like bulges found in nine of the galaxies ( sections 3 and 5 ) .",
    "the studied galaxies are part of a magnitude - limited near - ir s0 galaxy survey ( nirs0s ) , which has the following selection criteria : @xmath6 @xmath7 12.5 , inclination @xmath7 65@xmath8 , and hubble type @xmath93 @xmath7 @xmath10 @xmath7 1 @xcite .",
    "more than half of the 184 nirs0s galaxies are currently analyzed , which form an adequate sample to study the structural components of these galaxies .",
    "we show 2-dimensional decompositions of the surface brightness distribution for two oval / lens - dominated galaxies , with the following aims : ( 1 ) to show how to identify lenses in galaxies , ( 2 ) to stress the importance of accounting for bright ovals / lenses while deriving the parameters of the bulge , and , ( 3 ) to demonstrate the complexity of some s0 galaxies that needs to be explained by galaxy evolutionary models .",
    "our decompositions use a sersic function for the bulge , allowing for its flattening and deviation from elliptical isophotes , an exponential function for the disk , and either a sersic or ferrers function for the bars , ovals and lenses . in this study",
    "two types of bulges are considered : ( 1 ) classical elliptical - like bulges ( with sersic index @xmath11 near 4 ) , and ( 2 ) disk - like pseudobulges ( with smaller sersic index ) , formed mainly from the disk material via central star formation .",
    "however , the vertically thick boxy / peanut structures in barred galaxies ( often also called bulges ) @xcite are considered here as part of the bar .",
    "such structures , and nuclear bars and rings are not included to the flux of the bulge in our decompositions . the galaxies and their decompositions are shown in figures 1 and 2 : ngc 524 is dominated by two almost circular lenses , whereas ngc 5365 has two oval - shaped components , both ovals with an embedded bar .",
    "the lenses in ngc 524 are directly visible in the image , and showing in the surface brightness profile as distinct exponential sub - sections . the best fit is obtained by @xmath11=2.8 sersic bulge and two flat ferrers functions ( ferrers index=1 ) for the lenses , implying a fairly small bulge - to - total flux ratio @xmath12=0.28 . for ngc 5365",
    "the inner bar / oval system is fitted by a single sersic function and the outer one with a single ferrers function , leading to a fairly exponential bulge ( @xmath11=2.0 ) and a small @xmath12=0.17 .",
    "counting all the flux above the exponential disk as a bulge , would lead to a considerable overestimate of the bulge flux ( @xmath12 @xmath13 0.5 in two component fits ) , in accordance with laurikainen et al .",
    "( 2005 ) who showed that by omitting the bar / oval in the decomposition the @xmath12-flux ratio is overestimated , regardless of whether 1d or 2d - decompositions are used .",
    "it is challenging to explain how this kind of multiple ovals / lenses form in s0 galaxies and how they are related to the evolution of bars . in section 6",
    "they will be discussed in the context of cosmologically motivated simulations by heller et al .",
    "although bars in s0 galaxies are on average fairly prominent , weak bars are detected inside the ovals / lenses in eight of the galaxies : ngc 484 , ngc 507 , ngc 1161 , ngc 1351 , ngc 2768 , ngc 2902 , ngc 3998 and ngc 7377 .",
    "all these galaxies are classified as non - barred ( de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "1991 ; rc3 ) and no bar is directly visible in the @xmath14-band image .",
    "however , a weak , genuine bar is visible in the residual image after subtracting the bulge model obtained from our decomposition ( see fig . 3 for ngc 3998 ) .",
    "taking into account that the evolution of bars and bulges might be coupled , it is interesting to look closer at the properties of the bulges of these galaxies .",
    "we find fairly small sersic indexes for the bulges in these nine galaxies ( @xmath15=2.5 ) , similar to the typical values recently found for s0 galaxies in decompositions where a multi - component approach is used ( laurikainen et al . 2005 , 2007 ; gadotti 2008 ) .",
    "however , their average bulge - to - total flux ratio ( @xmath16 = 0.44 ) is higher than average for their hubble type , which for s0-s0/a galaxies @xmath13 0.25 - 0.28 ( laurikainen et al . 2005 , 2007 ; gadotti 2008 ) . in section 6 we will discuss that the weak bars , and probably also the massive , fairly exponential bulges in these galaxies , might be a manifestation of bar - induced secular evolution .",
    "the scale parameters of the bulge and the disk are sensitive to the evolutionary processes of galaxies during their cosmic history , and therefore offer an independent test of the importance of secular processes in s0s . a correlation between the scale parameters",
    "is expected in models where the bulges were formed in slow secular processes ( reviewed by kormendy @xmath17 kennicutt 2004 ) , whereas no correlation is expected in models where the bulges were formed either in a fast dissipative collapse @xcite , or by mergers of large @xcite or small galaxies @xcite .",
    "the radial scale length of the disk , @xmath1 , and the absolute magnitude , @xmath18 , in the @xmath14-band are calculated in the following manner : 0.25 cm @xmath19 [ kpc ] = @xmath20 @xmath21 d[kpc ] / @xmath22 .    @xmath23 = @xmath24 - @xmath25 - @xmath26 - ( 5 @xmath21 log d[mpc ] ) - 25.0 ,    0.25 cm    where the internal dust correction for @xmath1 , @xmath22 = [ 1.02 - 0.13 @xmath21 log ( cos @xmath27 ) ] , is from @xcite . for @xmath18 ,",
    "the internal dust correction is @xmath26 = [ 0.11 + 0.79 @xmath21 ( 1-cos @xmath27)@xmath28 , taken from @xcite . for galaxy distance d we use @xmath29 = 75 km s@xmath30 mpc@xmath30 , and , galactic extinction , @xmath25 , is from @xcite . for the effective radius of the bulge , @xmath0 ,",
    "no internal dust correction was made .",
    "the subscripts @xmath31 and @xmath32 refer to measured and intrinsic values , respectively .",
    "we find a clear correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath19 , with the coefficient of correlation of 0.66 , at the significance level of 7e-14 ( fig .",
    "the correlation is independent of the applied corrections .",
    "the correlation is found to be the same for bright ( @xmath18 @xmath33 -24.5 ) and faint ( @xmath18 @xmath34 -24.5 ) galaxies .",
    "this contradicts the recent result by @xcite who found an anti - correlation for bright s0s , and a positive correlation for faint s0s .",
    "this different result is most probably due to the deeper images and the more homogeneous database used in the present study .",
    "notice also that the scale parameters in barway et al . were derived using simple bulge - disk decompositions , whereas we use a multi - component approach .",
    "the correlation we find for s0s is similar to that found previously for spiral galaxies @xcite , and for 14 sb0 galaxies @xcite .",
    "finally , we compare the fractions of galaxies with bars and ovals / lenses in different hubble types",
    ". if s0s were simply stripped spirals one would expect similar bar fractions in s0s and in their spiral progenitors . in table 1",
    "we use rc3 family classes for calculating bar fractions in different hubble type bins : for s0-s0/a galaxies the whole nirs0s sample of 184 galaxies is used , whereas for spirals we use the similarly sized ohio state university bright spiral galaxy sample ( osubsgs , eskridge et al .",
    "we find that s0s ( 46@xmath25 @xmath3 ) have bars ( sb+sab ) less frequently than s0/a galaxies ( 77@xmath29@xmath3 ) or spirals ( 61 - 70 @xmath3 ) .",
    "the values for spirals are in agreement with those found previously by other authors @xcite .",
    "the bar fractions for s0 and s0/a galaxies in the sub - sample of 127 nirs0s galaxies ( 38@xmath25 and 76@xmath210 @xmath3 , respectively ) are nearly the same as for the complete nirs0s sample . in table 1 the fractions of multiple bars are calculated in respect of the total number of barred galaxies , while all the other values are given in respect of the total number galaxies within the hubble type bin .",
    "the uncertainties are estimated from @xmath35 , where @xmath36 denotes the fraction in question in a sample of @xmath37 systems .",
    "we then use the @xmath38 , the maximum m=2 fourier density amplitude in the bar region , normalized to m=0 , to study three bar strength bins within each hubble type bin . for the osubsgs",
    "we use the values from laurikainen et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , whereas for s0 and s0/a galaxies they were calculated in this study in a similar manner . as a lower limit for the barred galaxies we use @xmath38=0.1 .",
    "we confirm the above result that s0 galaxies have a smaller fraction of bars than s0/a galaxies or spirals .",
    "we find that : ( 1 ) sc - scd spirals have the largest number of weak bars ( @xmath38 = 0.1 - 0.3 ) and the smallest number of strong bars ( ( @xmath38 @xmath39 0.6 ) , and that the fraction of strong bars increases towards the s0/a galaxies .",
    "this is in agreement with the previous studies showing that the prominence of bars increases towards the early - type disk galaxies .",
    "( 2 ) quite interestingly , although the fraction of strong bars increases from late - type spirals towards s0/a galaxies , it suddenly drops from 38@xmath29 @xmath3 to 10@xmath23 @xmath3 for s0s .",
    "we also find that ( 3 ) s0 galaxies have a larger fraction of ovals / lenses than s0/a galaxies galaxies ( 97@xmath22 v.s 82@xmath40 @xmath3 ) , and that ( 4 ) s0/a galaxies have a larger fraction of multiple bars than earlier or later type galaxies ( see laine et al .",
    "2002 ; erwin @xmath17 sparke 2002 ) .",
    "the fraction of ovals / lenses is found to be the same for barred and for non - barred s0-s0/a galaxies ( 82@xmath41 @xmath3 v.s 86@xmath42 @xmath3 , respectively ) .",
    "although ovals and lenses might have different light distributions , they are not distinct enough to be considered separately in our statistics .",
    "in the current paradigm of galaxy formation , @xmath4cdm , the spheroidal components of galaxies were formed through mergers of disk galaxies : dry mergers are suggested to lead to the formation of elliptical galaxies , whereas mergers of gas poor with gas rich galaxies lead to the formation of bulges in the disk - dominated galaxies ( khockfar @xmath17 burkert 2003 ; naab et al .",
    "minor mergers are actually more common in the universe and they are suggested to form even 55 @xmath3 of the spheroid stars from accreted satellites ( abadi et al .",
    "2003 ) . in @xmath4cdm",
    "the disks form after a major merger when hot gas in the halo settles into the disk ( kauffmann et al .",
    "1999 ; springer @xmath17 hernquist 2005 ) . in this picture",
    "every dark matter halo is expected to possess a substantial pressure supported classical bulge with elliptical - like photometric properties ( steinmetz @xmath17 navarro 2002 ) .",
    "although many observations support this scenario it is also faced with severe problems , for example the bulges , not only in spiral galaxies , but even in s0-galaxies are fairly disk - like and have smaller bulge - to - total mass flux ratios than predicted by cosmological models .",
    "_ our finding that the scale parameters of the bulge ( @xmath0 ) and the disk ( @xmath1 ) are well correlated _ for s0s , provides an additional problem for @xmath4cdm : such a correlation is difficult to explain if the formation of bulges and disks in s0 galaxies were decoupled .",
    "alternatively , s0s might be descendants of spirals whose star formation has faded after consuming the gas or losing it by some stripping mechanism , like ram pressure stripping @xcite , halo stripping @xcite , or galaxy harrasment @xcite .",
    "recent evidence supporting this idea comes from the tully - fisher ( tf ) relation and from the analysis of the properties of globular clusters in galaxies .",
    "s0s lie below the spiral galaxies in the tf relation , having lower luminosities @xcite .",
    "this deviation is explained by luminosity evolution of spiral galaxies : the transformation from spirals to s0s occurred at various times in the past , and the galaxies have been passively fading ever since . the globular cluster frequency ( the number of globular clusters per unit @xmath43-band luminosity ) has been used as an independent estimate of the degree to which the luminosity of s0s has faded relative to that of its spiral progenitor @xcite .",
    "this estimate is based on the assumption that the frequency of globular clusters is constant during the transformation process .",
    "the fact that the bulges in s0-galaxies also have many characteristics of disk - like structures , including their kinematic properties ( cappellari et al .",
    "2007 ) , is consistent with this picture .",
    "however , if s0s were simply passively formed from s0/a spirals it would be difficult to explain our finding that _ the fraction of bars is considerably lower in s0s than in s0/a galaxies , which are expected to be their progenitors in the hubble sequence . _ bars should be fairly robust structures , evidenced by the fact that the bar fraction , at least in massive luminous spirals , is maintained nearly constant between the redshift range @xmath44= 0 - 0.84 @xcite .",
    "although the hypothesis of s0s as stripped spirals is a promising idea , an important piece of information is still missing in this picture .",
    "indeed , bars are expected to be efficient drivers of galaxy evolution : the angular momentum transfer between gas and stars leads to gas infall and subsequent star formation in the central regions , which can add to the mass of the bulge @xcite . if the angular momentum transfer occurs between the bar and the halo , that leads to the evolution of the bar @xcite : a bar first grows in mass and length , but if the bulge mass at the same time increases due to the gas infall , that might lead to a subsequent weakening of the bar .",
    "weakening of the bar is most efficient in strong bars with flat - top surface density profiles @xcite , typical for early - type disk galaxies ( elmegreen @xmath17 elmegreen 1985 ) . in this study",
    "we have shown indirect observational evidence of such evolution : _ it is tempting to think that bar weakening due to increased central mass concentration is the explanation for the lower fraction of bars and the larger fraction of ovals / lenses in s0s .",
    "_ we also find that s0s galaxies have a deficiency particularly of the strongest bars which fits to this picture .",
    "_ a manifestation of bar - induced secular evolution of galaxies is probably also our finding that nine galaxies in our sample have massive disk - like bulges ( @xmath16=0.44 , @xmath15=2.5 ) , surrounded by weak bars and lenses_. in principle , an increase in bulge mass in these galaxies could have occurred in a similar manner as discussed above .",
    "also , once the bulge mass had increased , the bar might have started to weaken , leaving only a weak bar inside a lens .",
    "the lenses surrounding the weak bars can be naturally explained as relics of the evolution of the bar : many barred galaxies have lenses of the same dimension as the bar , aligned with the bar major axis .",
    "a problem in this scenario is that normal spiral galaxies do nt have enough gas for making such massive bulges by star formation ( kormendy @xmath17 kennicutt 2004 ) , not at least without a significant accretion of extragalactic gas to the disk .",
    "it is still possible , however , that these galaxies are associated with the formation and evolution of bars at higher redshifts .",
    "the role of bars in cosmological simulations has not yet been studied much , but one such attempt has been made by @xcite .",
    "their simulations , starting from initial values motivated by cosmological simulations , include star formation , cooling and feedback . in these simulations disk - like bulges form at early phases of galaxy evolution during the gas - rich epoch in the history of galaxies , being thus capable of accounting for the large bulge - to - total flux ratios of the disky bulges found in some of the s0s .",
    "the triaxial halos are the driving force to the formation of primordial bars , which trigger nuclear bars . after 4 - 5 gyr",
    "the primary bars are weakened to fat ovals and the nuclear bars are decoupled .",
    "these processes might be a key for understanding the multiple bar / oval / lens structures seen in many s0 galaxies .",
