    "an extensive discussion of gps sources is provided in a review by odea ( 1998 ) .",
    "these two sources can also be classified by their morphology .",
    "there are two general morphological types of gps sources  core - jet structures , generally associated with quasars and at high redshifts , and compact double - lobed structures , generally associated with galaxies at lower redshifts ( odea et al .",
    "1991 ; conway et al .  1994 ; stanghellini et al .",
    "the latter group has garnered much interest because of their appearance as miniature versions of the classical double - lobed radio galaxies .",
    "studies of these sources generally refer to them as `` compact symmetric objects '' ( or csos ) , defined by wilkinson et al .",
    "( 1994 ) as radio sources with symmetric compact structure containing two steep - spectra , lobe - like features bracketing a compact , flat or inverted spectrum , core - like component . in many cases , though , the core component is undetected and so some such sources may be called `` compact doubles '' ( cds ) ( e.g.  phillips & mutel 1982 ; mutel et al .  1985 ) or `` cso candidates '' ( e.g.  an & baan 2012 ) .",
    "the two sources we discuss here contain two steep - spectra , lobe - like components ( henstock et al .",
    "the source @xmath0 has previously been identified as a cso ( augusto et al .",
    "2006 ) while @xmath1 has been identified as a cso candidate ( an et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "many authors have suggested that csos are young precursors to the large radio galaxies ( e.g.  phillips & mutel 1982 ; carvalho 1985 ; de young 1993 ; fanti et al .",
    "1995 ; murgia 2003 ) , while others have proposed that the growth of the jets is frustrated by interaction with dense ambient gas in the nuclei of the host galaxies ( van breugel 1984 ; gopal - krishna & wiita 1991 ) .",
    "other models involve both youth and frustration as the jets grow slowly in the early stages as the jets work their way through denser gas at smaller radii ( e.g.  begelman 1999 ; bicknell et al .",

    "2000 ; tinti & de zotti 2006 ; kawakatu et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "the gps sources with cso morphologies are generally considered as an extension of the compact steep spectrum ( or css ) sources , whose spectra turnover below 1 ghz and which have intermediate sizes , larger than csos but significantly smaller than the larger radio galaxies ( or lrgs ) . in a statistical study of css sources , fanti et al .  ( 1990 ) found a strong anti - correlation between the linear size , ls , and turnover frequency , @xmath10 . in the youth model ,",
    "gpss grow into csss and then into the lrgs .    in strong support of the youth model ,",
    "multi - epoch vlbi studies of many csos have revealed outward motions of features , with growth rates of @xmath110.1 c , implying ages of the radio - emitting structure from many hundreds to a few thousand years ( owsianik & conway 1998 ; taylor et al .",
    "2000 ; pihlstrm et al .  2003 ; gugliucci et al .  2005",

    "other age estimates obtained by applying energy considerations ( readhead et al .",
    "1996 ) and by fitting the high - frequency spectral breaks to continuous injection models ( murgia et al .",
    "1999 ) have yielded values astonishingly close to the measured kinematic ages .",
    "these agreements also imply that equipartition of energy exists in these sources .",
    "statistical studies revealing an overabundance of csos and csss relative to lrgs ( odea & baum 1997 ) presented challenges to the simple youth model , leading to the suggestion that a fraction of the smaller sources turn off after a relatively short period ( readhead et al .",
    "1994 ) . some models , though",
    ", successfully fit the population statistics by considering differing luminosity evolutions due to intermittency of nuclear activity ( reynolds & begelman 1997 ; begelman 1999 ) or to effects of a varying ambient gas density ( odea & baum 1997 ; snellen et al .",
    "2000 ; perucho & mart 2002 ) .",
    "more recently , an and baan ( 2012 ) measured the number of csos as a function of the linear size and of the kinematic age and found the numbers to decrease in both cases , suggesting that a significant fraction of cso s do indeed die out on a time scale of @xmath11 1000 years .",
    "the radio - frequency emission in gps sources above the spectral turnover is generally accepted as optically - thin synchrotron emission with the turnover of the spectra resulting from absorption at lower frequencies . however , the absorption mechanism responsible is still an unsettled issue .",
    "on one hand , ionized gas in the host galaxies , with densities and columns depths typical of the narrow - emission - line regions ( or ` nelr ' ) , would cause free - free absorption ( or ` ffa ' ) with optical depths of the right magnitude to cause spectral turnovers at ghz frequencies ( van breugel 1984 ; bicknell et al .",
    "1997 ; begelman 1999 ; stawarz et al .",
    "2008 ; osterero et al .",
    "2010 ) , while , on the other hand , the synchrotron electron densities and magnetic fields in the compact radio emitting structures are likely to be large enough to also cause sufficient synchrotron self - absorption ( or ` ssa ' ) at ghz frequencies ( hodges et al .",

    "; spoelstra et al .",

    "2000 ) and statistics that conflict strongly with ffa models for the turnovers ( de vries et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "other models , on the other hand , successfully fit the @xmath10 vs.  ls anti - correlation with ffa turnovers by either invoking a radially decreasing ionized gas density ( bicknell et al .",
    "1997 ) or engulfed interstellar clouds whose surfaces are photoionized by uv radiation from the lobes and the central agn ( begelman 1999 ; stawarz et al .  2008 ; ostorero et al .",
    "the linear sizes of gps sources are comparable to that of the nelr , which contain sufficient free electrons to cause ghz ffa turnovers ( van breugel 1984 ) , and numerous observations have revealed an association of ionized gas emission apparently coincident with the radio lobes ( mccarthy et al .  1991 ; devries et al .",

    "finally , observations of some individual gps / csos have provided strong evidence in favor of ffa over ssa ( e.g.  peck et al .",

    "2004 ; kameno et al .",
    "2005 ) .      here , we discuss tests of both the ssa and ffa models in two cso or cso - candidate sources using multi - frequency vlbi observations .",
    "most previous attempts have focused on spectroscopic analyses , which have not been definitive because of the complexity of the composite spectra . with our multi - frequency , high - resolution maps we have a means of separating the positional variation effects from the spectroscopic . in particular , following the approach of marr et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , through the creation of optical - depth maps at different frequencies , we are able to use the positional and spectroscopic factors independently to test the models in two ways .",
    "morphologically , the optical depths in the ssa model should follow the structure in the high - frequency intensity maps . in principle",
    ", ssa is important when the energy density in the emitted , unabsorbed synchrotron radiation would be greater than the energy density of the synchrotron electrons .",
    "this leads to the familiar ssa turnover frequency equation in which @xmath12 ( kellermann & pauliny - toth 1981 ) , or , for a resolved source , @xmath13 and , since the intensity , @xmath14 , is greatest where the magnetic field , b , and the particle densities are greatest ssa will cause higher frequency spectral turnovers where the raw , unabsorbed synchrotron radiation is most intense .",
    "therefore , the inferred ssa optical depth at any frequency below the turnover should be largest at the positions where the high - frequency intensity is greatest .    with ffa ,",
    "though , the absorption occurs in the foreground and so the morphology in the optical - depth map will show no relation to the high - frequency intensity maps . the free - free optical depth at any position",
    "can then be approximated , for reasonable values of temperature , as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the frequency in ghz and must be less than 10 ghz , @xmath17 is the electron temperature in kelvin , @xmath18 is the free electron density in @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is distance through the source in pc ( altenhoff et al .  1960 ; mezger & henderson 1967 ) .",
    "although all these parameters are likely to vary throughout the source , the frequency dependence is constant and so can be pulled out of the integral , yielding @xmath21 the total effect on the spectrum along the line of sight , regardless of variation of the parameters in the integrand , should still yield an optical depth that fits @xmath22 . for convenience of discussion , we define the frequency - independent part of equation 2 as @xmath23 so that the free - free optical depth can be rewritten as @xmath24 where @xmath16 is given in ghz .",
    "equation 3 separates the spatial dependence of the free - free optical depth , @xmath23 , and the frequency dependence factor , @xmath25 . with high - resolution , multi - frequency optical depths , one",
    "can then test the ffa model by determining the fit of equation 3 to the maps .",
    "however , we note that variations in @xmath23 perpendicular to line of sight on scales smaller than the synthesized beam are to be expected and will affect the apparent frequency dependence of the observed spectrum , even at vlbi resolutions .",
    "polarization of the radiation provides an additional test of the absorption mechanism .",
    "if ffa dominates then there is a large column depth of free electrons which depolarize the radiation ( peck et al .",
    "1999 ; gugliucci et al .",
    "dual - polarization observations have , indeed , shown the detection of polarized radiation in gps / csos to be extremely rare ( peck & taylor 2000 ; pollack et al .",

    "additionally , a number of gps and css sources have been found to show large faraday rotation measures ( kato et al .",
    "1987 ; stanghellini et al .",
    "1998 ) . with ssa , on the other hand ,",
    "a net linear polarization is likely to occur with a 90@xmath9 rotation in position angle across the spectral peak ( mutoh et al .",
    "although , if the magnetic field structure is sufficiently complex , even with ssa the total polarization could still be below detection limits .",

    "editing and mapping , using hybrid clean ( readhead & wilkinson 1978 ) , were performed in difmap ( shepherd et al .  1994 , 1995 ;",
    "shepherd 1997 ) .",
    "the data were averaged for 2 minute intervals , followed by amplitude - based flagging . the first phase self - cal used models obtained from 1995 observations ( taylor et al .",
    "uniform ( _ u , v _ ) weighting was used in the initial iterations , with small clean boxes that barely encompassed obvious emission structure , and a gain of 0.05 .",
    "as the clean deepened , boxes were increased as needed while excluding apparent spurious features .",
    "natural ( _ u , v _ ) weighting was used to provide deeper cleaning when the intensity of real structure in the residual map was within 3@xmath33 .",
    "amplitude self - calibration was applied when the rms agreement of the model with the data was less than 1.5@xmath34    for the final images , uniform weighting was used to produce higher resolution maps .",
    "the clean component models generally fit the data to within 1.0@xmath34 the dynamic ranges in the final maps are of order 1000:1 ; the largest being 3100:1 for @xmath0 at 1.7 ghz and the smallest is 130 for @xmath0 at 22.2 ghz .",
    "spectral - index maps were made with each pair of data sets in neighboring frequency bands .",
    "the data were edited to yield matching ( _ u , v _ ) coverage and then remapped with difmap .",
    "the final clean maps were made with natural weighting this time , to increase the signal to noise and decrease the uncertainties in the spectral indices .",
    "each pair of final clean maps were convolved with identical clean beams and then read into aips , which was used to create spectral - index maps with the task comb .    in this way , we produced spectral - index maps between 1.7 and 2.3 ghz , 2.3 and 5.0 ghz , 5.0 and 8.4 ghz , and 8.4 and 15.4 ghz .",
    "the 22.2-ghz maps , once the shorter spacings were cut to match the shortest 15.4-ghz spacing , were deemed to be of insufficient fidelity .",
    "we have not , therefore , included the 22.2-ghz data in any analysis in the rest of this project .",
    "moderate percent errors in the clean maps propagate to large errors in the spectral index , and so we masked the spectral - index maps where the signal in either clean map was less than 10@xmath33 .    since the observations were not phase - referenced to a nearby calibrator , no absolute position information was available and so the maps could be arbitrarily shifted relative to each other .",
    "if the maps are misaligned , extremely large and small spectral indices would result , particularly at the edges of the emission regions .",
    "additionally , the spectral indices across any feature will have a strong gradient .",
    "we started with map alignments which minimized the total relative shift of the major intensity peaks .",
    "with @xmath1 , this produced reasonable looking spectral - index maps with no extreme values on the edges of components and roughly symmetric @xmath35 values .",
    "we inferred that no need for additional shifts were needed . with @xmath0 ,",
    "the relative positions of the component peaks were consistent at the lower frequencies ( 1.7 and 2.3 ghz ) and the resultant spectral index map looked reasonable . at higher frequencies , we chose alignments that yielded the minimum magnitudes of the extreme @xmath35 s ( both positive and negative ) .",
    "we also checked that our final maps did not display noticeable gradients in @xmath35 , especially at the edges of features .",
    "maps of the uncertainties in the inferred spectral indices , based on both the rms in the clean maps and a 5% uncertainty in amplitude calibration , added in quadrature , and propagated through the process , were also created .",
    "data at all five frequencies were involved in creating optical depth maps at the three lower frequencies .",
    "all data sets , for each source , were truncated at both long and short ( _ u , v _ ) spacings to yield the same minimum and maximum ( _ u , v _ ) distances and the maps were all convolved with the same clean beam .",
    "to attenuate , somewhat , the loss of resolution , the final maps were convolved with uniform weighting .    the clean maps at 15.4 and 8.4 ghz provide close approximations of the unabsorbed emission spectrum at each point in the map , and so extrapolation of these maps to lower frequencies yields reasonable maps of the unabsorbed emission at the lower frequencies .",
    "if @xmath36 is the spectral index between 15.4 and 8.4 ghz at some position @xmath37 in the map , and @xmath38 is the intensity at 8.4 ghz , then the unabsorbed intensity at 2.3 ghz is @xmath39 ^{\\alpha_{15 - 8}(x , y)}.\\eqno(4)\\ ] ] the optical depth at 2.3 ghz at each point in the map , then , is obtained by @xmath40 and , similarly for the optical - depth maps at 1.7 and 5.0 ghz .",
    "optical - depth maps were made using a number of steps of the aips task comb which reproduced the math of equations 4 and 5 .",
    "the truncated data sets have much smaller ( _ u , v _ ) aspect ratios ( ratio of longest to shortest baseline ) than the original data sets and so this method could have resulted in the maps missing much of the structure . of course , with the larger beam the small scale structure was indeed not as resolved as in the full - data clean maps .",
    "one might be concerned , though , about loss of information of the large scale structure .",
    "the detected flux densities on the remaining shortest baselines at 1.3 ghz were , in fact , 95% of those in the full data sets .",
    "we therefore compared the resultant clean maps made with the truncated data sets with those from the full data sets and found no noticeable difference in the large scale structure .      by stacking the maps made at identical resolutions we obtained spectra at each position in each source , which we then used to compare fits to simple models of ffa and ssa .",
    "for the ffa model we fit a single free - free absorption component in the foreground of a single power - law synchrotron source , as given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the raw , unabsorbed intensity at 2.267 ghz ; @xmath35 is the raw synchrotron spectral index ; @xmath16 is the frequency in ghz , and @xmath43 is the ffa optical depth at 1 ghz . for the ssa model , following kameno et al .",

    "we consider it highly unlikely that the structure of the synchrotron emitting region is homogeneous , but since we have only five frequencies in the spectra , a fit to a more complex ssa model is not warranted .",
    "since both sources were observed in the 1990s , we could examine our maps for movement of features over a decade .",
    "observations of @xmath1 were made at 5 ghz in 1995 and at 15 ghz in 2001 , and observations of @xmath0 were made at 5 ghz in 1992 and 1994 and at 8 ghz in 1995 .",
    "using modelfit in difmap , we fitted series of gaussian components to each complete ( _ u , v _ ) data set .",
    "there are also images available on the mojave database web page ( lister et al .",
    "2009 ) which include 15-ghz vlba observations of @xmath0 from 1995 to 2002 .",
    "however , these observations are of lower resolution and smaller dynamic range and so were not useful for our analysis .",
    "the results for @xmath1 are clearer and easier to interpret and so , in this and following sections , we discuss the results for this source first .        the clean maps at all six frequencies are displayed in figure 1 with the peak and rms intensities listed in the figure caption .    the intensity distribution at the four lower frequencies is completely contained within two major , featureless components , which we infer are the lobes of the radio structure .",
    "we expect that the core is located somewhere between and undetected .",

    "the uncertainty is minimum where the intensity is largest and stays close to the minimum value over most of the source . only near the edges of the structure",

    "the spectra are essentially flat , with @xmath470.3 . between 2.3 and 1.7 ghz ,",
    "all @xmath35 s are positive , indicating that the spectra of all regions have turned over .",
    "the eastern component still has a slightly smaller @xmath35 than the western component .",
    "as clearly shown in figure 2 , the spectral turnover of @xmath1 occurs across the entire source uniformly .",
    "this is inconsistent with the expectations for ssa , in which the brightest regions would turn over at higher frequencies .",
    "the optical - depth maps of @xmath1 are shown in figure 3 , the uncertainties , as with the spectral - index map uncertainties , are roughly constant across most of the structure in each map and the minimum and maximum values are listed in table 3 .",
    "the optical depths across @xmath1 are almost constant ( except at the edges where the uncertainties are large ) .",
    "this level of uniformity of optical depth is suggestive of a smooth foreground of absorbing gas , and is in conflict with ssa , in which the optical depth map should reflect the 15.4-ghz intensity map . we conclude that the optical depth maps of @xmath1 provides strong evidence that ffa is significant and is the main ( if not only ) cause for the spectral turnover in this source .      in figure 4 , we display the spectra at the positions of the 5.0-ghz intensity peaks .",

    "the fits to our simple one - component model were better than expected , considering that the minor axis of the synthesized beams in our opacity maps corresponds to a linear scale of @xmath11 15 pc .",

    "although the ssa model can not be definitively ruled out , keeping ssa as a significant factor in the spectral turnover of @xmath1 requires a tremendous coincidence .",

    "since we have images in both the optically thick and thin spectral realms , as an additional test of the ssa model , we can compare estimates of the magnetic fields assuming equipartition , following miley ( 1980 ) , and assuming ssa , following marscher ( 1983 ) . using our modelfit gaussian components at the peaks in the lobes , the equipartition magnetic field estimates , which are based on the 8.4 and 15.4 ghz data , assuming a linear depth through the source equal to the average of the two perpendicular distances , all fall in the range from 0.07 to 0.15 gauss .",
    "the ssa magnetic field estimation assumes that the flux density that we measure at frequencies at and below the turnover is emitted from the effective ssa photosphere at the observed frequency and hence the turnover frequency equation can be used .",

    "<S> we obtained dual - polarization vlbi observations at six frequencies of the compact symmetric object @xmath0 and the cso candidate @xmath1 . by comparing the three lower - frequency maps with extrapolations of the high frequency maps we produced maps of the optical depth as a function of frequency . </S>",
    "<S> the morphology of the optical - depth maps of @xmath1 is strikingly smooth , suggestive of a foreground screen of absorbing gas . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra at the intensity peaks fit a simple free - free absorption model , with @xmath2 , better than a simple synchrotron self - absorption model , in which @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the case for free - free absorption in @xmath1 is strong . </S>",
    "<S> the optical - depth maps of @xmath0 exhibit structure , but the morphology does not correlate with that in the intensity maps . </S>",
    "<S> the fit of the spectra at the peaks to a simple free - free absorption model yields @xmath4 , but since the turnover is gradual the fit is relatively insensitive to the input parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we find that free - free absorption by a thin amount of gas in @xmath0 is likely , but not definitive . </S>",
    "<S> one compact feature in @xmath0 has an inverted spectrum even at the highest frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> we infer this to be the location of the core and estimate an upper limit to the magnetic field of order 3 gauss at a radius of order 1 pc . in comparison with maps from observations at earlier epochs , </S>",
    "<S> no apparent growth in either @xmath1 or @xmath0 is apparent , with upper limits of 0.03 and 0.02 mas yr@xmath5 , corresponding to maximum linear separation speeds of 0.6c and 0.4c . </S>"
