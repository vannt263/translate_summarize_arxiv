    "the interaction of the @xmath1 hyperon with nuclear matter may be represented by the complex single particle ( s.p . ) optical model potential @xmath8 . in this paper",
    "we present our attempts to determine @xmath7 and @xmath9 .",
    "we also point out the most realistic two - body @xmath3 interaction among the available obe models of the baryon - baryon interaction .    in the present paper",
    "we discuss the following sources of information on @xmath2 : @xmath3 scattering data in sec.2 , @xmath4 atoms in sec.3 , associated production reactions in sec.4 , and strangeness exchange reactions in sec.5 .",
    "our conclusions are presented in sec.6 .",
    "the way from the @xmath3 scattering data to @xmath2 consists of two steps : first , we determine the two - body @xmath3 interaction @xmath10 , and second , with this @xmath10 we calculate @xmath2 .",
    "the scarcity of the two - body @xmath3 data makes the first step very difficult . a way of overcoming these difficulties was followed by de swart and his collaborators in nijmegen : they assumed the mechanism of one - boson exchange ( obe ) and the su(3 ) symmetry which enabled them to employ the numerous @xmath11 data in determining the parameters of their two - body interaction .",
    "in this way they produced a number of the nijmegen models of the baryon - baryon interaction : models d @xcite , f @xcite , soft core ( sc ) model @xcite , and the new soft - core ( nsc ) model @xcite .    , and @xmath12 of the @xmath1 absorptive potential in nuclear matter of density @xmath13 as functions of @xmath14.,height=207 ]      in calculating @xmath7 we use the real part of the effective @xmath3 interaction yng @xcite in nuclear matter . the yng interaction is the configuration space representation of the g matrix calculated in the low order brueckner approximation with the nijmegen models of the baryon - baryon interaction .",
    "our results obtained for @xmath7 as function of the nucleon density @xmath15 are shown in fig .",
    "1 . as the dependence of @xmath7 on the @xmath1 momentum @xmath14 is not very strong in the relevant interval of @xmath14 @xcite , we use for @xmath7 its value calculated at @xmath16 .",
    "we see that all the nijmegen interaction models , except for model f , lead to pure attractive @xmath7 which implies the existence of bound states of @xmath1 hyperons in the nuclear core , , @xmath1 hypernuclei .",
    "since no @xmath1 hypernuclei have been observed , he @xcite is an exception . in the theoretical description of this state , harada and his collaborators @xcite apply phenomenological @xmath3 interactions , in particular , the interaction sap - f simulating at low energies the nijmegen model f interaction .",
    "they show that essential for the existence of the bound state of @xmath17he is a strong lane component @xmath18 in @xmath7 , and among the nijmegen models the strongest @xmath18 is implied by model f.@xcite ] we conclude that among the nijmegen interaction models model f is the only realistic representation of the @xmath3 interaction .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , the imaginary part of the yng interaction is very sensitive to the choice of the intermediate state energies in the @xmath19 matrix equation . in this situation we decided to use for @xmath9 the semi - classical expression in terms of the total cross sections ( modified by the exclusion principle ) for @xmath3 scattering , described in @xcite .",
    "we denote by @xmath20 the contribution to the absorptive potential of the @xmath21 conversion process @xmath22 and by @xmath23 the contribution of the @xmath3 elastic scattering , and have @xmath24 .",
    ", only the elastic @xmath11 scattering contributes to @xmath25 , and the situation is similar as in the case of the contribution @xmath23 to @xmath9 . ] our results obtained for @xmath26 for nuclear matter ( with n = z ) at equilibrium density @xmath27 0.166 @xmath28 are shown in fig .",
    "2 . with increasing momentum @xmath14 the @xmath29 conversion cross section decreases , on the other hand",
    "the suppression of @xmath20 by the exclusion principle weakens . as the net result @xmath20",
    "does not change very much with @xmath14 .",
    "the same two mechanisms act in the case of @xmath23 . here",
    ", however , the action of the exclusion principle is much more pronounced : at @xmath16 the suppression of @xmath23 is complete . at higher",
    "momenta , where the pauli blocking is not important , the total elastic cross section is much bigger than the conversion cross section , and we have @xmath30 , and consequently @xmath31 .",
    "the available data on strong interaction effects in @xmath4 atoms consist of 23 data points : strong interaction shifts @xmath32 and widths @xmath33 of the observed levels . these shifts and widths",
    "can be measured directly only in the lowest @xmath4 atomic levels .",
    "the widths of the next to the last level can be obtained indirectly from measurements of the relative yields of x - rays .    in @xcite , we have estimated the 23 values of @xmath32 and @xmath33 from the difference between the eigenvalues of the schrdinger equation of @xmath4 in @xmath4 atoms with the strong @xmath4-atomic nucleus interaction and without this interaction . to obtain this strong interaction ,",
    "we applied the local density approximation , and used our optical model of sec .",
    "the agreement of our results , calculated with the optical potentials ( obtained with the 4 nijmegen @xmath3 interaction models ) with the 23 empirical data points is characterized by the following values of @xmath34 : @xmath34(model d ) @xmath35 130 , @xmath34(model f ) = 38.1 , @xmath34(model sc ) = 55.0 , @xmath34(model nsc ) @xmath35 904 , and we conclude that the @xmath4 atomic data point out at model f as the best representation of the @xmath3 interaction .",
    "requires an attractive @xmath1 potential at the nuclear surface , at low densities . ]",
    "the first associated @xmath1 production reaction @xmath36 was observed at kek on @xmath37si target at pion momentum of 1.2 gev / c ( @xcite,@xcite ) , and this reaction is the subject of the present analysis .",
    "we consider the reaction @xmath36 in which the pion @xmath38 with momentum @xmath39 hits a proton in the @xmath37si target in the state @xmath40 and emerges in the final state as kaon @xmath41 moving in the direction @xmath42 with energy @xmath43 , whereas the hit proton emerges in the final state as a @xmath4 hyperon with momentum @xmath44 .",
    "we apply the simple impulse approximation described in @xcite , with @xmath41 and @xmath38 plane waves , and obtain : @xmath45 where the momentum transfer @xmath46 , and @xmath47 is the @xmath1 scattering wave function which is the solution of the s , p .",
    "schrdinger equation with the s.p .",
    "potential @xmath48 where for @xmath7 and @xmath9 we use the nuclear matter results discussed in section 2 , calculated at @xmath49 $ ] , where @xmath50=27 is the number of nucleons in the final state .    for the @xmath37si target nucleus",
    "we assume a simple shell model with a square well s.p , potential @xmath51 ( which determines @xmath40 ) with the radius @xmath52 ( and with a spin - orbit term ) .",
    "the parameters of @xmath51 are adjusted to the proton separation energies ( in particular @xmath53fm ) .",
    "for @xmath54 we make the simple and plausible assumption : @xmath55 .    in the inclusive kek experiments",
    "@xcite-@xcite only the energy spectrum of kaons at fixed @xmath56 was measured . to obtain this energy spectrum",
    ", we have to integrate the cross section ( [ ia ] ) over @xmath56 .",
    "reaction on @xmath57be at @xmath58 at @xmath59 gev / c obtained with @xmath7 determined by models f and d of the @xmath3 interaction .",
    "curves denoted by @xmath60 were obtained with @xmath61 .",
    "data points are taken from @xcite.,width=211,height=185 ]    we present our results for the inclusive cross section as a function of @xmath62 , the separation ( binding ) energy of @xmath1 from the hypernuclear system produced . our model f and d results in contradistinction to model f leading to repulsive @xmath7 ( at densities inside nulei - see fig .",
    "1 ) . consequently",
    ", the results for the kaon spectrum for models sc and nsc are expected to be similar as in case of model d. ] for kaon spectrum from @xmath36 reaction on @xmath37si at @xmath63 at @xmath64 gev / c are shown in fig .",
    "3 . we see that the best fit to the data points is obtained for @xmath7 derived from model f and with @xmath65",
    ". the fit would improve if we considered the distortion of kaon and especially of pion waves ( it was noticed already in ref . @xcite that this distortion pushes the kaon spectrum down ) .",
    "inclusion into the absorptive potential of the contribution @xmath23 of the elastic @xmath3 scattering is essential for obtaining this result with @xmath7(model f ) = 17.25 mev .",
    "earlier estimates of the kaon spectrum without this contribution suggested a repulsive @xmath7 with an unexpected strength of about 100 mev .",
    "notice that the action of the absorptive potential @xmath9 on the @xmath1 wave function ( decrease of this wave function ) is similar as the action of a repulsive @xmath7 .",
    "therefore we achieve with strong absorption the same final effect with a relatively weaker repulsion .",
    "first observations of the strangeness exchange @xmath66 reactions with a reliable accuracy were performed at bnl . here , we shall discuss the @xmath67 reaction observed at bnl on be@xmath57 target with 600 mev / c kaons.@xcite proceeding similarly as in the case of the associated production described in sec.4 , we get the results shown in fig .",
    "4 . we see that similarly as in sect .",
    "4 the fit to the data points obtained for @xmath7 derived from model f is much better than the fit obtained with model d.",
    "@xmath68 the real part @xmath7 of the @xmath1 optical potential is repulsive inside the nucleus and has a shallow attractive pocket at the nuclear surface .",
