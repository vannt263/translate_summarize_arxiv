    "the cosmic ray energy spectrum extends over more than eleven orders of magnitude in energy ( from below @xmath2 ev to above @xmath3 ev ) .",
    "it can be approximated by a broken power law with four spectral features : the knee at a few @xmath4 ev @xcite , the ankle at @xmath5 ev @xcite , the cutoff or suppression at @xmath6 ev @xcite , and a second knee at @xmath7 ev , recently reported by the kascade - grande collaboration @xcite .",
    "several experimental techniques are used for the observation of the cosmic rays , depending on the energy range under consideration . in particular ,",
    "the direct observation of the primary particles is possible up to energies of the order of @xmath8 ev . for larger energies",
    "the study of cosmic rays is done by observing the atmospheric air showers that they generate as a consequence of their interactions with air molecules in the atmosphere .",
    "there are two classes of ground - based detectors , surface detectors and fluorescence telescopes .",
    "the surface detectors observe the lateral distribution of the showers by sampling the secondary particles that reach the earth s surface , whereas the fluorescence telescopes observe the fluorescence and cherenkov photons generated , during the longitudinal development of the showers , as a result of the interaction of the secondary charged particles with the air molecules @xcite .    despite great experimental effort done in the last years",
    "the origin of the cosmic rays is still unknown .",
    "the observations used to study their origin comprise : the energy spectrum , the distribution of the arrival directions , and the composition profile @xcite .    certainly , the detailed study of the composition as a function of energy is of great importance to unveil the origin of the cosmic rays at all energies ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review on composition ) .",
    "in particular , it is believed that the composition information is crucial to find the transition between the galactic and extragalactic components of the cosmic rays ( see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite ) and to elucidate the origin of the suppression at the highest energies @xcite .",
    "this feature of the spectrum could originate as a result of the propagation of the cosmic rays in the intergalactic medium , or by the end of the efficiency of the extragalactic sources to accelerate particles at the highest energies , or by a combination of both effects .    at the highest energies ( @xmath9 ev ) , the composition of the cosmic rays is studied by using different observable parameters obtained from shower measurements which are very sensitive to the primary mass .",
    "the parameters most sensitive to primary mass are the atmospheric depth at which the maximum development of the showers is reached , which can be reconstructed from the fluorescence telescope data , and the muon content of the showers or a parameter closely related to it , which can be obtained from dedicated muon detectors ( see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the fluorescence light emitted during the shower development is proportional to the deposited energy .",
    "a fraction of these photons is detected by the fluorescence telescopes , making possible the reconstruction of the longitudinal profiles which yields an estimator of the energy of the primary particle .",
    "the energy reconstructed in this way is largely independent of simulations , just a small correction is done , by using simulations of the showers , which corresponds to the so - called invisible energy @xcite . in contrast , the energy calibration of surface detectors alone has to be done by using detailed simulations of the showers and the detectors .",
    "the use of simulated showers introduces large systematic uncertainties because the hadronic interactions at the energies of the cosmic rays are unknown .",
    "then , the models used for shower simulation extrapolate low energy data taken from accelerator experiments by several orders of magnitude in order to reach the energy of the cosmic rays .",
    "note that , at present , the hadronic interaction models are being updated in order to reproduce the large hadron collider data , which reaches up to cosmic ray energies of the order of @xmath10 ev ( @xmath11 tev ) @xcite .",
    "the duty cycle of the fluorescence telescopes is @xmath0 and that of the surface detectors is @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , in order to have a large duty cycle and an energy calibration almost independent of simulations , the present generation of cosmic ray observatories , the pierre auger observatory in the southern hemisphere and telescope array in the northern hemisphere , combine both techniques .",
    "the energy scale of the surface detectors is obtained by using a parameter which is in general the interpolated signal at a given distance to the shower axis .",
    "the calibration curve that relates this surface parameter with the primary energy , reconstructed from the fluorescence telescope , is obtained experimentally from a subset of high quality events observed in coincidence by both types of detectors @xcite .",
    "therefore , if the surface parameter used as an energy estimator depends on primary type , the energy scale depends on the composition of the cosmic rays .",
    "the use of this energy scale in composition analyses introduces biases that can be important when the parameters used to infer the primary mass have a strong dependence on primary energy ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a first study ) .    in this work",
    "we study the effects of using an energy scale dependent on composition in mass composition analyses . for that purpose",
    "we develop a dedicated analytical method .",
    "we consider the amiga project @xcite to illustrate in a simplified but realistic way the use of the method .",
    "the parameter sensitive to the primary mass is the number of muons at 600 m from the shower axis @xcite , which depends almost linearly with primary energy .",
    "therefore , composition analyses based on this parameter are supposed to be quite affected by the use of a composition dependent calibration curve .",
    "it is worth mentioning that many surface parameters like @xmath12 @xcite , the risetime of the signals in surface detectors @xcite , the slope of the lateral distribution function @xcite , the curvature ratio of the shower front @xcite , etc .",
    "were proposed and sometimes used in composition analyses .",
    "the composition analyses that make use of these parameters together with a calibration curve dependent on composition are affected by the effect studied in this work for the case of the number of muons in the context of amiga .",
    "each particular case involving different mass sensitive parameters and energy calibration methods has to be analysed in detail in order to estimate the importance of the biases introduced by this practice .",
    "the simulations used in this work are the ones generated for the studies done in ref .",
    "@xcite , they correspond to amiga .",
    "amiga will consist in a triangular grid of 750 m spacing composed by pairs of detectors , a water - cherenkov tank and a 30 m@xmath13 muon counter buried underground .",
    "the energy region under consideration goes from @xmath14 ev up to @xmath15 ev .",
    "the atmospheric air showers used in ref .",
    "@xcite to produce the simulated data were generated by using aires @xcite with qgsjet - ii-03 @xcite as the high energy hadronic interaction model .",
    "the showers were simulated with fixed energies from @xmath16 to @xmath17 in steps of @xmath18 . in this work just proton and iron primaries at @xmath19 zenith angle are considered .",
    "for each primary energy and primary type a set 100 showers were generated .",
    "the muon counters are segmented in 192 scintillation strips .",
    "part of the light generated by a charged particle that goes through a given strip is collected by a wavelength shifter fibre optic and transported to a multi - anode photomultiplier .",
    "the electronics has an independent channel for each strip which gives a digital one as output for each muon pulse .",
    "note that more than one muon arriving in a time interval corresponding to the width of a muon pulse is counted as one .",
    "that is called pile - up effect .    as described in ref .",
    "@xcite , a simplified simulation of the muon counters is performed .",
    "muon counters of 100 % of efficiency buried underground at @xmath20 m depth , which corresponds to a muon energy threshold of @xmath21 gev , are considered .",
    "the pile - up effect is also included in the simulations .    from the data taken by the cherenkov detectors the lateral distribution function of the signal , the impact point , and the arrival direction of the showers are reconstructed . while the muon lateral distribution function is reconstructed from the data taken by the muon detectors , following the method developed in ref .",
    "note that the reconstruction method includes a correction for the pile - up effect .",
    "the parameter used as energy estimator , considered in this work , corresponds to the interpolated signal collected by the water - cherenkov detectors at 600 m from the shower axis , @xmath22 , and the parameter sensitive to primary mass corresponds to the interpolated number of muons at 600 m from the shower axis , @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "note that the signal @xmath22 is in units of vem ( vertical equivalent muon ) , which corresponds to the average signal deposited by a vertical muon that crosses the tank by its center @xcite .",
    "also note that @xmath23 is the total number of muons in an area of 30 m@xmath13 for showers at @xmath24 , therefore , it has no units .",
    "the amiga muon detectors were designed for zenith angles from @xmath25 to @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , we consider here showers of @xmath19 because it is the median of the zenith angle distribution .",
    "the parameter @xmath23 for showers of different zenith angles can be transformed to @xmath19 by using the corresponding muon attenuation curve @xcite .",
    "figure [ nmus ] shows @xmath23 versus @xmath22 for proton and iron primaries for three different values of primary energy .",
    "versus @xmath22 for @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath15 ev corresponding to proton and iron primaries of @xmath19 of zenith angle .",

    "in this work we have studied the importance of a composition dependent energy scale on composition analyses .",
    "the method pursued dwells on a combined distribution function of the mass and energy estimator parameters which allows to analytically perform all further analyses and their physical interpretation . in this paper",
    "we have shown the strength of this approach which might be applied to different experimental scenarios with appropriate distribution function .",
    "this approach allows a clear insight in the impact of different mass composition mixing , which is of paramount importance to understand the cosmic ray spectrum , in particular in composition changing regions .",
    "we have applied the method developed to amiga in order to exemplify these effects in a realistic experimental context .",
    "we have taken the number of muons and the signal in the water - cherenkov detectors , both evaluated at 600 m from the shower axis , as the mass sensitive and energy estimator parameters , respectively .",
    "we have found that the distribution functions of the number of muons for proton and iron primaries can be modified when an energy calibration dependent on composition is used to reconstruct the energy of the events .",
    "however , the relative bias on the determination of the mean value of the number of muons is quite small , of the order of a few % in the whole energy range under consideration . this is true even for energy estimators with merit factors of the order of the one corresponding to the number of muons .",
    "we have obtained the same upper limit on the relative bias for the two physical situations that we have considered : a constant proton abundance as a function of primary energy and a smooth transition from iron to proton primaries at @xmath114 ev .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the impact of the use of an energy scale dependent on composition in composition analyses has to be analyzed in detail in each particular case .",
    "the reason for that is that the effects introduced by this practice depend on the parameter sensitive to the primary mass under consideration , on the type of detectors used to observe the air showers , and on the methods used to reconstruct the shower parameters .",

    "in the simplified physical situation treated here it is assumed that the fluctuations of the parameter used to reconstruct the primary energy are negligible , i.e.  @xmath33(e , a)=0 $ ] for @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "considering that the energy calibration is given by the mean value of the signal , it is possible to obtain the true energy @xmath37 of each primary as a function of the reconstructed energy from the following expression , @xmath117 here a binary mixture of protons and iron nuclei and a constant proton abundance are assumed .",
    "the mean value of the number of muons is obtained , in this case , following a similar procedure to the one described in section [ secbias ] , @xmath118 the mean values of parameters @xmath23 and @xmath22 have an almost linear dependence on primary energy .",
    "then , in order to further simplify the calculation let us assume an exact linear dependence on primary energy of the mean value of both parameters , @xmath119 where @xmath108 is a reference energy .",
    "therefore , the mean value of @xmath23 as a function of the true energy is given by , @xmath120 by using eqs .",
    "( [ scalsc ] , [ mnmusc],[nmusc],[ssc ] ) and ( [ nmusct ] ) the relative bias on the mean value of the number of muons as a function of the reconstructed energy can be written as , @xmath121 where , @xmath122 here a power law energy spectrum of the form @xmath123 is assumed .    from eq .",
    "( [ rbsc ] ) it can be seen that the relative bias is independent on primary energy .",
    "also , when the composition is pure , the cosmic rays are only protons or iron nuclei ( @xmath97 or @xmath96 ) , the relative bias is zero , as expected .",
    "moreover , the bias also disappears when @xmath124 , @xmath125 , or @xmath126 .",
    "figure [ biassc ] shows the relative bias as a function of the proton abundance for different values of @xmath76 , starting from @xmath105 up to @xmath127 in steps of @xmath128 .",
    "the values @xmath129 and @xmath130 are used to make the plot , which correspond to the ratios between the mean values of each parameter ( @xmath23 and @xmath22 ) for proton and iron at @xmath114 ev .      from figure [ biassc ]",
    "it can be seen that the relative bias is an increasing function of @xmath76 , it goes from negative values at @xmath105 to positive values for @xmath131 .",
    "this behavior can be understood from the fact that for a given value of the reconstructed energy proton events come from larger values of the true energy but iron events come from smaller values , therefore , for a power law energy spectrum the iron events have a larger weight , which increases with @xmath76 moving the mean value towards the one corresponding to iron nuclei . in this way , after increasing @xmath76 sufficiently the relative bias becomes positive .    for every @xmath132",
    ", the relative bias has an extreme point placed at an intermediate value of the proton abundance .",
    "this extreme value is a maximum if @xmath131 and it is a minimum if @xmath133 .",
    "the expression for the proton abundance corresponding to the extreme point can be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ rbsc ] ) , which is given by , @xmath134 which is valid for @xmath135 , @xmath136 , and @xmath132 .",
    "as can be seen from figure [ biassc ] , @xmath137 varies very slowly with @xmath76 , in fact it goes from @xmath138 at @xmath105 to @xmath139 at @xmath127 ."
