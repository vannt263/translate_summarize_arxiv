    "the critical points are obtained for each temperature ( below the symmetric - matter critical temperature ) by determining the @xmath191 value for which the two phases with the same tangent plane merge together . to evaluate this point ,",

    "we have introduced the isoscalar @xmath267 and the isovector @xmath268 chemical potentials .",

    "in this paper , based on a mean - field analysis of nuclear matter with a realistic skyrme sly230a effective interaction , we have established that nuclear matter presents a first - order phase transition even when the isospin degree of freedom is explicitly accounted for .",
