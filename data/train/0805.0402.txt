    "a large variety of physical systems can be described in terms of an elastic string interacting with a quenched random potential .",
    "the role of such a string can be played by a domain wall in a two - dimensional magnet , a vortex line in a superconductor , a dislocation in a crystal , and so on ; however following ref .",
    "the systems of such a kind are usually discussed under the generic name of a directed polymer in a random medium .",
    "the unfading interest to this problem is additionally supported by its resemblance to more complex systems with quenched disorder ( e.g. , spin glasses ) , as well as by its close relation to the dynamics of a randomly stirred fluid and to the problem of a stochastic growth ( see refs . and for reviews ) .",
    "one of the main objects of interest in the directed polymer problem is @xmath0 , the free - energy distribution function for large polymer length @xmath1 . in particular , the knowledge of this distribution function",
    "allows one to make conclusions on the distribution of displacements . the first important step in the analysis of @xmath0",
    "was made twenty years ago by kardar , @xcite who suggested that all moments of @xmath0 can be found by calculating the moments @xmath2 of the distribution of the partition function @xmath3 and proposed an asymptotically exact method for the calculation of @xmath4 in a @xmath5-dimensional system ( a string confined to a plane ) with a @xmath6-correlated random potential .",
    "however , soon after that medina and kardar @xcite understood ( see also ref . ) that the information provided by the approach introduced in ref .",
    "is insufficient for finding any of the moments of @xmath0 .",
    "however , it allows one to find @xcite the tail of @xmath0 at large negative @xmath7 ( the left tail ) .",
    "in such a situation the conclusions on the width of the distribution function have to rely on the assumption that at large @xmath1 it acquires a universal form , @xmath8 incorporating the dependence on all parameters through a single characteristic free - energy scale @xmath9 , which therefore can be extracted from the known form of the tail .",
    "the form of eq .",
    "( [ p * ] ) assumes that @xmath7 , the free energy of a directed polymer in a given realization of a disorder , is counted off from its average , @xmath10 or , more precisely , from the linear in @xmath1 contribution to @xmath11 ( that is , @xmath12 $ ] ) .",
    "the same convention is implied below .",
    "only recently it has been understood @xcite that the form of the tail following from zhang s analysis @xcite is applicable for the description only of the most distant part of the left tail and therefore has no direct relation to the universal form of the distribution function which is achieved in the limit of @xmath13 . at large but finite @xmath1 the form of @xmath0 given by eq .",
    "( [ p * ] ) can be expected to be achieved only for not too large fluctuations of @xmath7 [ that is , for @xmath14 with @xmath15 tending to infinity with the increase of @xmath1 ] , whereas the behavior of @xmath0 at @xmath17 remains nonuniversal and is not obliged to have anything in common with @xmath18 . in particular , it can incorporate quite different characteristic free - energy scales .",
    "thus , the fact that zhang s",
    "approach @xcite reproduces both the correct form of the left tail of @xmath18 and the correct estimate of the universal free energy scale @xmath19 ( which is the only relevant free - energy scale inside the universal region ) , is not more than a happy coincidence .",
    "in contrast to that , the behavior of the right tail of @xmath0 inside the universal region is qualitatively different from its behavior in the nonuniversal part of the tail .",
    "@xcite    in this article the analysis of the universal and non - universal tails of @xmath0 developed in ref .",
    "is presented in more detail and also is extended to the investigation of @xmath20-dimensional systems , in which polymer s displacement can be treated as a @xmath21-dimensional vector .",
    "the article is organized as follows .    in sec .",
    "[ ii ] we formulate the continuous model which is traditionally applied for the description of the directed polymer problem and briefly review its relation to the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) model @xcite of a stochastic growth , as well as to the burgers turbulence problem .",
    "[ of ] provides a short introduction to the optimal fluctuation approach , which can be used for the description of the most distant ( non - universal ) parts of the tails of @xmath0 . in refs .",
    "an analogous approach has been used to investigate the distribution of velocity and its derivatives in the burgers turbulence problem , which however requires one to consider optimal fluctuations with completely different structures then studied here .    in sec .",
    "[ fl ] the optimal fluctuation approach is applied for the analysis of the far - left tail of @xmath0 , and in sec .",
    "[ fr ] of the far - right tail .",
    "our main attention is focused on the systems with a @xmath6-correlated random potential ; however for @xmath22 the problem with purely @xmath6-functional correlations becomes ill - defined , so we also consider the case when a random potential correlations can be characterized by a finite correlation radius .    for finding the universal parts of both tails one also has to look for optimal fluctuations , but taking into account that in this regime the parameters of the system have to be considered as scale dependent due to their renormalization by fluctuations .",
    "this is done in sec .",
    "the validity of this approach is confirmed by the consistency of its predictions with the results of the exact solution @xcite of the @xmath5-dimensional polynuclear growth ( png ) model , as well as by obtaining identical estimates for @xmath19 in the left and right tails .    the concluding sec .",

    "@xcite    our main attention throughout this work is focused on a system with free initial condition , that is , we assume that only one end of a string is fixed , whereas the other one is free to fluctuate . in terms of the kpz problem",
    "@xcite the same distribution function describes the distribution of heights in the regime of a nonstationary growth in the situation when an interface starts to grow from a flat configuration ( @xmath1 being the total time of the growth ) .",
    "one only has to bear in mind that the height ( as defined in the standard form of the kpz equation ) and the free energy of the directed polymer problem differ from each other by the sign .",
    "therefore , what we call here the left ( right ) tail of @xmath0 in terms of the kpz problem corresponds to the right ( left ) tail of the height distribution function .",
    "finally , appendix [ fic ] is devoted to demonstrating that when both end points of a directed polymer are fixed , the form of the left tail of @xmath0 remains basically the same as for free initial condition .",

    "<S> the optimal - fluctuation approach is applied to study the most distant ( non - universal ) tails of the free - energy distribution function @xmath0 for an elastic string ( of a large but finite length @xmath1 ) interacting with a quenched random potential . </S>",
    "<S> a further modification of this approach is proposed which takes into account the renormalization effects and allows one to study the closest ( universal ) parts of the tails . </S>",
    "<S> the problem is analyzed for different dimensions of a space in which the polymer is imbedded . in terms of the stochastic growth problem </S>",
    "<S> , the same distribution function describes the distribution of heights in the regime of a non - stationary growth in the situation when an interface starts to grow from a flat configuration . </S>"
