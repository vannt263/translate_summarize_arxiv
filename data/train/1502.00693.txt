    "projective configurations of points on the plane is a classical subject in algebraic geometry and its history in the context of linear systems of curves can be traced back to 18th century ( g.cramer , l.euler , etc . ) . in modern times ,",
    "projective configurations are studied both from algebro - geometric viewpoint ( geometric invariant theory , hilbert schemes , del pezzo surfaces ) , and from combinatorial geometric viewpoint ( matroid theory ) . in the latter approach",
    "just linear phenomena are essential , and in particular , a generic object of consideration is a _ simple @xmath4-configuration _ , that is a set of @xmath4 points in @xmath1 in which no triple of points is collinear .",
    "the dual object is _ a simple @xmath4-arrangement _ , that is a set of @xmath4 real lines containing no concurrent triples .",
    "a combinatorial characterization of a simple @xmath4-arrangement is its _ oriented matroid _ , which is roughly speaking a description of the mutual position of its partition polygons . for simple n - configurations",
    "it is essentially a description how do the plane lines separate the configuration points ( see @xcite for precise definitions ) . such a combinatorial description was given for simple @xmath4-arrangements with @xmath3 in @xcite and @xcite . in the beginning of 1980s",
    "n.mnv proved his universality theorem and in particular , constructed examples of combinatorially equivalent simple configurations which can not be connected by a deformation .",
    "his initial example with @xmath5 was improved by p.suvorov ( 1988 ) to @xmath6 , and recently ( 2013 ) by y.tsukamoto to @xmath7 .",
    "mnv s work motivated the first author to verify in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) that for @xmath3 the deformation classification still coincides with the combinatorial one , or in the other words , to prove connectedness of the realization spaces of the corresponding oriented matroids .",
    "one of applications of this in low - dimensional topology was found in @xcite , via the link to the geometry of campedelli surfaces .",
    "as @xmath4 grows , a combinatorial classification of simple @xmath4-configurations becomes a task for computer enumeration : there exist 135 combinatorial types of simple @xmath8-arrangements ( r.canham , e.halsey , 1971 , j.goodman and r.pollack , 1980 ) and 4381 types of simple @xmath9-arrangements ( j.richter-gebert , g.gonzales-springer and g.laffaille , 1989 ) .",
    "the classification includes analysis of arrangements of _ pseudolines _ ( oriented matroids of rank @xmath10 ) , their _ stretchability _ ( realizability by lines ) and analysis of connectedness of the realization space of a matroid that gives a deformation classification ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "8) for more details ) .",
    "in what follows , we need only the following summary of the deformation classification of simple @xmath4-configurations for @xmath3 .",
    "for @xmath11 it is trivial : simple @xmath12-configurations form a single deformation component , denoted by @xmath13 .",
    "this is because the points of such a configuration lie on a non - singular conic .    for @xmath14",
    "there are @xmath15 deformation classes shown on figure  [ graphlg56 ] . on this figure , we sketched configurations @xmath16 together with some edges ( line segments ) joining pairs of points , @xmath17 .",
    "namely , we sketch such an edge if and only if it is not crossed by any of the lines connecting pairs of the remaining @xmath18 points of @xmath16 .",
    "the graph , @xmath19 , that we obtain for a given configuration @xmath16 will be called the _ adjacency graph _ of @xmath16 ( in the context of the oriented matroids , there is a similar notion of _ inseparability graphs _ ) . for @xmath14 , the number of its connected components",
    ", @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath10 , or @xmath22 , characterizes @xmath16 up to deformation .",
    "the deformation classes of 6-configurations with @xmath23 components are denoted @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and the configurations of these four classes are called respectively _ cyclic , bicomponent , tricomponent _ , and _ icosahedral _ 6-configurations .    given a simple 7-configuration @xmath16 , we label a point @xmath26 with an index @xmath27 if @xmath28 .",
    "count of the labels gives a quadruple @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the number of points @xmath26 with @xmath31 .",
    "we call @xmath32 the _ derivative code _ of @xmath16 .",
    "there exist 11 deformation classes of simple 7-configurations that are shown on figure [ graphlg7 ] , together with their adjacency graphs and labels @xmath33 .",
    "+   +    it is trivial to notice that if @xmath17 are adjacent vertices in graph @xmath34 , then @xmath35 , so , on figure [ graphlg7 ] we label whole components of @xmath34 rather than its vertices .",
    "the derivative codes happen to distinguish the deformation classes , and we denote by @xmath36 the class formed by simple @xmath0-configurations @xmath16 with the derivative code @xmath37 .",
    "problems related to the linear systems ( pencils and nets ) of real cubic curves along with related problems on the real del pezzo surfaces of degrees 1 , 2 and 3 lead to a necessity to refine the notion of simple configurations by taking into account also _",
    "quadratic degenerations _ of configurations , in which six points become _ coconic _",
    "( lying on one conic ) .",
    "these problems involve also real aronhold sets of bitangents to quartics , see section [ concluding ] .",
    "it is noteworthy that a similar motivation ( interest to aronhold sets ) was indicated by l.cummings , although in her research @xcite she did not step beyond simple 7-configurations .",
    "the object of our interest is not that well - studied as simple configurations , although definitely is not new .",
    "it appears for example in @xcite in the context of studying cayley octads and their relation to the aronhold sets .",
    "we adopt here the terminology from @xcite and say that an @xmath4-configuration is _ typical _ , if it is simple and in addition does not contain coconic sextuples of points . analyzing the combinatorics of the root system @xmath38 related to the del pezzo surfaces associated with typical 7-configurations , j.  sekiguchi @xcite found 14 types of such configurations ( these types give some kind of a combinatorial classification ) . later in a joint work with t.fukui ( in 1998 ) , he presented a similar computer - assisted enumeration for typical 8-configurations by analysis of the root system @xmath39 . in a different form , in terms of separation of configuration points by conics ,",
    "a description of typical 7-configurations was given by s.  le touz @xcite in the context of studying the real rational pencils of cubics .",
    "at the same time , a similar combinatorial description of typical 7-configurations was given in @xcite .",
    "the principal goal in @xcite ( and in the current presentation of its results ) is however to give a more subtle _ deformation classification _ of such configurations , that is to show that the realization space for each of the 14 combinatorial types of typical @xmath0-configuration is connected . like deformation classification of simple configurations",
    ", this result leads to a deformation classification of certain associated real algebro - geometric objects . in the case of typical @xmath0-configurations",
    "such objects are real del pezzo surfaces of degree 2 ( marked with @xmath0 exceptional curves ) , nets of cubics in @xmath40 , cayley octads and nets of quadrics in @xmath41 .",
    "we tried to indicate one of such applications in the end of the paper .    for us , a _ deformation of @xmath4-configuration _ is simply a path in the corresponding configuration space , or in the other words , a continuous family @xmath42 , @xmath43 $ ] , formed by @xmath4-configurations .",
    "we call it _ l - deformation _ if @xmath42 are simple configurations , and _ q - deformation _ if @xmath42 are typical ones .",
    "it is not difficult to observe ( see section 2 ) that for @xmath22-configurations the two classifications coincide : typical 6-configurations can be connected by an l - deformation if and only if they can be connected by a q - deformation . however , for @xmath44 , one l - deformation class may contain several q - deformation classes , and our main goal is to find their number in the case of @xmath45 , for each of the 11 l - deformation classes shown on figure [ graphlg7 ] .    [ 14classes ] typical @xmath0-configurations split into @xmath2 q - deformation classes . among these classes , two",
    "are contained in the class @xmath46 , three in the class @xmath47 , and each of the remaining @xmath9 l - deformation classes of simple @xmath0-configurations contains just one q - deformation class .",
    "how to subdivide l - deformation classes @xmath46 and @xmath47 into 2 and respectively 3 q - deformation classes is shown in subsections  [ non - collabsible ] and , [ decoadj ] .",
    "in section  [ preliminaries ] we recall the scheme of l - deformation classification from @xcite and give q - deformation classification of typical @xmath22-configurations .",
    "we treat also three cases of @xmath0-configurations , in which connectedness of the realization spaces is obvious .",
    "sections 35 are devoted to q - deformation classification for the three existing types of 7-configurations : heptagonal , hexagonal , and pentagonal . in the last section , we discuss some applications including a description of the 14 real aronhold sets ( figure  [ cac7graph ] ) .",
    "we indicated how this description can be derived from our results using cremona transformations .",
    "we sketched also an application : a method ( alternative to that of @xcite ) to describe the topology of real rational cubics passing through the points of a 7-configuration .",
    "this paper is essentially based on @xcite , which was partially motivated by our attempts to understand and develop the results of @xcite .",
    "l - deformation monodromy group _ of a simple @xmath4-configuration @xmath16 we mean the subgroup , @xmath48 , of the permutation group @xmath49 realized by l - deformations , that is the image in @xmath49 of the fundamental group of the l - deformation component of @xmath16 ( using some fixed numeration of points of @xmath16 , we can and will identify @xmath49 with the symmetric group @xmath50 ) . for a typical @xmath4-configuration @xmath16 , we similarly define the _ q - deformation monodromy group _ @xmath51 formed by the permutations realized by q - deformations . in the case",
    "@xmath52 , any permutation can be realized by a deformation ( and in fact , by a projective transformation ) , so we have @xmath53 . for @xmath11",
    ", we obtain the dihedral group @xmath54 associated to the pentagon @xmath19 ( as it was noted the adjacency graph is an l - deformation invariant ) .    more generally , we can consider a class of simple _",
    "@xmath4-gonal @xmath4-configurations _ , @xmath16 , that are defined as ones forming a convex @xmath4-gon in the complement @xmath55 , of some line @xmath56 .",
    "for @xmath57 this @xmath4-gon ( that coincides with the adjacency graph @xmath19 ) is preserved by the monodromy group action , and it is easy to conclude that @xmath58 . in particular , @xmath59 for @xmath60 .",
    "it is also not difficult to show ( see @xcite ) that for @xmath22-configurations @xmath16 from components @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 , groups @xmath48 are respectively @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and the icosahedral group .",
    "these facts however are not used in our paper .",
    "the @xmath67 lines passing through the pairs of points of a simple @xmath4-configuration @xmath16 divide @xmath1 into polygons that we call _ l - polygons associated to @xmath68_. group @xmath48 acts naturally on the set of those l - polygons that can not be collapsed in a process of l - deformation .",
    "it is easy to check that for @xmath11 none of the 31 l - polygons can be collapsed .",
    "thus , we obtain an action of @xmath69 , which divide the set of @xmath70 l - polygons into 6 orbits : three _ internal orbits _ formed by l - polygons lying inside pentagon @xmath19 and three _ external _ ones , placed outside @xmath19 ( see figure [ 4lpolygons ] ) .    by adding a point @xmath71 in one of the l - polygons associated to @xmath16 we obtain a simple @xmath22-configuration , @xmath72 .",
    "the l - deformation class of @xmath73 depends obviously only on the @xmath48-orbit of the l - polygon containing @xmath71 .",
    "figure [ 4lpolygons ] shows the correspondence between the six orbits and the four classes @xmath74 .",
    "note that for @xmath23 equal to @xmath20 and @xmath22 class @xmath74 is represented by one orbit , while for @xmath21 and @xmath10 such class is represented by two orbits .",
    "this is because @xmath48 acts transitively on the points of @xmath16 for @xmath75 , while for @xmath76 the vertices of @xmath16 split into two @xmath48-orbits .      in the dual projective plane @xmath77 , consider the arrangement of lines @xmath78 which is dual to a given @xmath4-configuration @xmath79 . lines @xmath80",
    "divide @xmath77 into polygons that we call _ subdivision polygons _ of @xmath81 .",
    "we define the _ polygonal spectrum _ of an @xmath4-configuration @xmath16 as the @xmath82-tuple @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the number of @xmath85-gonal subdivision polygons of @xmath81 .",
    "euler s formula easily implies that @xmath86 for simple @xmath4-configurations .",
    "it is easy to see also that @xmath87 if @xmath57 ( in fact , it is known that @xmath88 ) , which implies that for @xmath57 , at least one subdivision polygon has @xmath12 or more sides .    if @xmath89 is a line , then point @xmath90 that is dual to @xmath91 should belong to one of the subdivision polygons , say @xmath92 . then @xmath92 is an @xmath93-gon if and only if the convex hull , @xmath94 , of @xmath16 in the affine plane @xmath95 is an @xmath93-gon .",
    "note that @xmath93-gons @xmath92 and @xmath94 are dual : points @xmath96 are dual to lines @xmath97 disjoint from @xmath92 ( and vice versa ) .",
    "this gives two options for a simple @xmath22-configuration @xmath16 .",
    "the first option is @xmath98 that implies @xmath60 .",
    "the second option is @xmath99 , @xmath100 , which means that the convex hull of @xmath16 is a pentagon in some affine chart @xmath95 .",
    "a simple @xmath0-configurations is called _ heptagonal _ if @xmath101 , _ hexagonal _ if @xmath102 and @xmath98 , and _ pentagonal _ if @xmath103 and @xmath100 .",
    "note that @xmath104 for any simple 7-configuration , and so , one of these three conditions is satisfied . in terms of the affine chart @xmath105 , these three cases give ( if point @xmath106 is chosen inside a subdivision polygon with the maximal number of sides ) : @xmath0 points forming a convex heptagon , @xmath22 points forming a convex hexagon plus a point inside it , and @xmath12 points forming a convex pentagon plus two points inside it ( see table below ) .    [ spectrandcodes ]      following @xcite , we outline here the l - deformation classification in the most essential for us case of simple @xmath0-configurations with @xmath107 . by definition ,",
    "such configurations can be presented as @xmath72 , where @xmath16 is its cyclic 6-subconfiguration and @xmath71 is an additional point ( there are precisely @xmath108 ways to choose such a decomposition of @xmath73 ) .",
    "like in the case of 6-configurations considered above , the monodromy group @xmath59 of @xmath60 acts on the l - polygons associated to @xmath16 ( see figure [ 8lregions ] ) , and the l - deformation class of @xmath73 depends only on the orbit ( @xmath109,[b],\\dots$ ] ) of the l - polygon that contains point @xmath71 .",
    "an additional attention is required to the four l - polygons that can be collapsed , namely , the `` central '' triangle @xmath110 in figure [ 8lregions ] and three other triangles , one of which is marked as @xmath92 on this figure : it is bounded by a principal diagonal and the two sides of the hexagon that have no common vertices with this diagonal .",
    "we skip here the arguments from @xcite ( but after passing to the q - deformation classification in propositions [ specialqdeformation ] and [ f - connect ] , we will provide in fact a more subtle version of this proof ) .",
    "note that @xmath111-action is well - defined on the contractible l - polygons as well as on the non - contactable ones : this action preserves @xmath110 invariant and naturally permutes the three polygons of type @xmath92 so that they form a single orbit , @xmath112 $ ] .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath113 for any simple 7-configuration , and that our assumption on @xmath73 admits three options .",
    "the first option is @xmath114 , that is to say , @xmath73 is a heptagonal configuration .",
    "this correspond to location of @xmath71 inside one of the six l - polygons from the @xmath111-orbit @xmath109 $ ] of a triangle @xmath115 .",
    "the second option is location of @xmath71 inside hexagon @xmath19 , in one of the _ internal l - polygons _ from the orbits @xmath116 $ ] , @xmath117 $ ] , @xmath118 $ ] , or @xmath119 $ ] ( see figure [ 8lregions ] ) . in this case ,",
    "@xmath102 and @xmath120 , that is to say , configuration @xmath73 is hexagonal . in the remaining case , @xmath71 lies outside @xmath19 , but not inside one of the six triangles of type @xmath115 .",
    "then @xmath73 may be either hexagonal with @xmath121 , or pentagonal with @xmath122 .",
    "totally , we enumerated 8 l - deformation classes out of 11 .",
    "the remaining 3 pentagonal classes with @xmath123 can be described by placing two points inside a convex affine 5-configuration , as it can be understood from figure [ graphlg7 ] ( for details see @xcite ) .      given a typical @xmath22-configuration @xmath16",
    ", we say that its point @xmath26 is _ dominant _ ( _ subdominant _ ) if it lies outside of ( respectively , inside ) conic @xmath124 that passes through the remaining @xmath12 points of @xmath16 . here , by points _",
    "inside _ ( _ outside of _ ) @xmath124 we mean points lying in the component of @xmath125 homeomorphic to a disc , ( respectively , in the other component ) .",
    "we color the vertices of adjacency graph @xmath19 : the dominant points of @xmath16 in black and subdominant ones in white , see figure [ adjgraph6 ] for the result .",
    "+    graphs @xmath19 are bipartite , , adjacent vertices have different colors .",
    "[ sd ] for a typical @xmath22-configuration @xmath16 , every edge of @xmath19 connects a dominant and a subdominant points .",
    "it follows from analysis of the pencil of conics passing through @xmath15 points of @xmath16 : a singular conic from this pencil can not intersect an edge of @xmath19 connecting the remaining two points .",
    "let @xmath127 denote the subset formed by simple @xmath4-configurations , which have a subconfiguration of six points lying on a conic .",
    "then @xmath128 is the set of typical @xmath4-configurations .",
    "note that @xmath129 , so , @xmath24 for @xmath130 are formed entirely by typical configurations and thus , give three q - deformation components @xmath131 , @xmath130 , of typical @xmath22-configurations .",
    "it follows immediately also that @xmath132 for @xmath16 from these three q - deformation components .    to complete the classification it is left to observe connectedness of @xmath133 , which implies that @xmath134 is the remaining q - deformation component in @xmath135 .",
    "connectedness follows immediately from the next lemma and the fact that any @xmath22-configuration @xmath136 has a dominant point ( in fact , it has exactly three such points , see figure [ adjgraph6 ] ) .",
    "[ quadraticsix ] consider two hexagonal @xmath22-configurations @xmath137 , with marked dominant points @xmath138 , @xmath139 .",
    "then , there is a @xmath126-deformation @xmath140 , @xmath43 $ ] that takes @xmath141 to @xmath142 .    the same idea as in subsection [ lgc6 ]",
    "is applied : the triangular l - polygons marked by @xmath20 on figure [ 4lpolygons ] are divided into pairs of _",
    "q - regions _ by the conic passing through the vertices of a pentagon .",
    "a sixth point placed outside ( inside ) of the conic is dominant ( subdominant ) .",
    "the monodromy group @xmath143 , @xmath139 , acts transitively on the q - regions of the same kind ( in our case , on the parts of triangles marked by 1 that lie outside the conic ) , and these regions can not be contracted in the process of l - deformation of the pentagon .",
    "therefore , an l - deformation between @xmath144 and @xmath145 that brings the q - region containing @xmath141 into the one containing @xmath142 can be extended to a required q - deformation @xmath140 ( see figure  [ regionfor6pts ] ) .",
    "it follows easily that @xmath146 , for @xmath147 , namely , @xmath65 is a subgroup of @xmath148 that preserves the colors of vertices of graph @xmath19 on figure [ adjgraph6 ] .",
    "let @xmath149 , where @xmath37 is one of the 11 derivative codes of @xmath0-configurations ( see figure [ graphlg7 ] or table [ spectrandcodes ] ) .",
    "like in the case of 6-configurations , some of the l - deformation components @xmath36 , namely , the ones with @xmath123 are disjoint from @xmath150 , therefore in these cases @xmath151 are q - deformation components .",
    "from table [ spectrandcodes ] , this holds for @xmath37 being @xmath152 , @xmath153 , and @xmath154 .",
    "we shall prove in subsection [ heptagonal - qdeformations ] connectedness of space @xmath155 formed by heptagonal typical configurations . for",

    "is existence of a point @xmath26 such that @xmath161 .",
    "we shall prove more : among the 14 ways to numerate cyclically the vertices of heptagon @xmath19 ( starting from any vertex , one can go around in two possible directions ) , one can distinguish a particular one that we call the _ canonical cyclic numeration_.
