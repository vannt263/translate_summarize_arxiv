    "due to the invariance principle , the semi - discrete polymer is a universal scaling limit for discrete directed polymers when @xmath105 is fixed and @xmath2 goes to infinity ( and temperature is suitably scaled  see for instance @xcite ) . as such",
    ", the semi - discrete polymer inherits the solvability of the log - gamma polymer .",

    "the fredholm determinant given in corollary [ cor : coszdet ] was anticipated in @xcite via the formalism of macdonald processes yet its rigorous proof was so far lacking because of the nontriviality of certain decay estimates required by that approach .",

    "step 2 : in order to show this desired localization we will use a taylor series with remainder estimate in a small ball of radius approximately @xmath22 around @xmath163 , and outside that ball we will use the estimate for the @xmath174 and @xmath184 contour , and a similarly straightforward estimate for the @xmath72 contour .",
