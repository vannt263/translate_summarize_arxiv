    "the mechanisms of the stimulated emission due to intersubband transitions of electrons in different tunnel - coupled structures ( monopolar laser effect ) have been investigated during the previous decade ( see refs . in @xcite ) . as a result , both mid - ir and thz lasers viability has been demonstrated with the use of the scheme based on the vertical transport through quantum cascade structures , which incorporate injector and active regions .",

    "note that beyond the born approximation the broadening can be comparable to the averaged electron energy .",
    "next , in spite of the general equations ( 10 ) and ( 14 ) are written through an arbitrary spectral density function , with the use of statistically independent random potentials in each qw , final calculations were performed for a model that includes scattering by zero - radius centers and large - scale potential .",
    "such a model describes the interplay between homogeneous and inhomogeneous mechanisms of broadening .",
    "other approximations we have made are rather standard . we restrict ourselves to the case of uniform biased field and qw population neglecting a possible domain formation caused by the negative differential conductivity of bsl @xcite .",
    "one can avoid instabilities in a short enough bsl because the thz modes propagate in the in - plane directions .",
    "the coulomb correlations , which modify the response as the concentration increases , are not taken into account here .",
    "this contribution , as well as the consideration of an intermediate - scale potential , requires a special attention in analogy with the case of a single qw @xcite .",
    "finally , the simplified description of the ideal ( without any damping ) waveguide structure is enough to estimate the characteristic planar size of a device suitable for thz stimulated emission : one have to compare the maximal negative value of @xmath190 obtained with a damping length calculated for similar waveguides , see 21 .",
    "note , that more complicate waveguides ( see refs . in @xcite ) may be effective    to conclude , the simplifications listed do not change the peculiarities of the thz response or the numerical estimates given in sec .",
    "it seems likely that the contribution of @xmath202 can be found experimentally .",
    "more detailed numerical simulations are necessary in order to estimate a potential for applications of bsl as a thz emitter .",
