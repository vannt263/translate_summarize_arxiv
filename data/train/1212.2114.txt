    "quantum coherent effects in electronic transport such as aharonov - bohm ( ab ) conductance oscillations , weak localization , and universal conductance fluctuations  @xcite originate from interferences between partially scattered electronic waves . in contrast to classical transport , quantum transport is thus fundamentally influenced by scattering phases , and the transport properties of electronic nanodevices operating at low temperatures are determined by complex transmission amplitudes , instead of real transmission probabilities .",

    "their key observation is that , as the number of electrons on the qd is reduced from 20 down to 0 , @xmath9 undergoes a crossover from the _ universal phase behavior _ regime , with regularly alternating @xmath0 jumps at and in - between cb resonances , to a _ mesoscopic regime _ where phase lapses in - between cb resonances occur in a random fashion , so that the in - phase behavior of the transmission at cb resonances gets lost .",

    "in addition , when decreasing the internal hopping amplitude to achieve smaller energy level separation with respect to the level couplings , no tendency towards universality was obtained , independently of the value of the interaction strength . the exploration of a large parameter space of level separations , coupling widths , and level spacings allowed to approach the conditions of not so small qd , where the universality was claimed to arise by the effect of electronic correlations . this is not the case . only at large enough qd ( @xmath189 )",
