    "within the current standard cosmological model of the universe , the gravitationally dominant component of matter is dark .",
    "hence , dark matter governs the formation and evolution of the luminous matter like galaxies in the universe .",
    "gravitational lensing has proved to be a promising technique in the past few decades allowing us not only to measure the mass of dark matter halos which host luminous galaxies in their centres but also to probe the underlying dark matter distribution of the lensing halo .",

    ", we present a sample of gems  lens candidates in the e - cdfs .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    ", we calculate the expected number of lenses and explain the steps involved in the selection of the lens candidates . in section 3 , we describe the decomposition of _ hst _  images into candidate lensing galaxy and candidate lensed images .",
    "the decomposition is carried out by using the two - dimensional surface brightness modelling program galfit  @xcite .",
    "we model the candidate lens systems as gravitational lenses and check whether the derived model parameters are consistent with a gravitational lens case .",
    "if the image configuration is not due to gravitational lensing , it is likely that no sensible lens model can reproduce the lensed image configuration .",
    "we present results of the mass modelling in section 4 . in section 5 ,",
    "we compute the stellar mass of the candidate lensing galaxy , using color - based stellar mass - to - light ratio ( mlr ) and compare with the lensing masses as a sanity check .",
    "furthermore , we compare the sample properties with those in the literature , and discuss the probability of the candidates being lens systems .",
    "we end with a brief summary in section 6 .",
    "we use the following cosmological parameters in our calculations : @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and h@xmath7  km  s@xmath8  mpc@xmath8 .",
    "the number of lenses expected to be found in a given survey depends upon the survey area , the source number density , @xmath9 , and the optical depth for lensing , @xmath10 .",
    "the number of lenses per unit steradian , @xmath11 is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the source redshift and @xmath14 is the intrinsic source limiting magnitude .",
    "we estimated the expected number of lenses in the gems  survey by using optical depths from table  2 of @xcite .",
    "these optical depths were estimated by integrating the lensing cross - section of halos in the millennium simulation .",
    "we calculated @xmath9 by following eq .",
    "1@xmath15eq .  3 of @xcite which requires the distribution of source redshifts and source counts .",
    "we adopt the source redshift distribution given by @xmath16^\\beta\\right)\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath17 and @xmath18 and use the cumulative source counts distribution from the f814w(@xmath19 ) band data of the hubble deep field south ( hdf - s , * ? ? ?",
    "the @xmath2 band limiting magnitude of gems  is used to calculate a corresponding @xmath19 band limiting magnitude .",
    "the hdf - s sources follow the relation @xmath20 and gems  has a @xmath2 band limiting magnitude of 28.25 @xcite .",
    "thus , a corresponding equivalent limiting magnitude in @xmath19 band for gems  would be 27.76 .",
    "we note that due to lensing magnification , sources which are intrinsically fainter than the limiting magnitude might also fall into our lens sample .",
    "this would mean that our calculation of expected no . of lenses based on sources only brighter than limiting magnitude",
    "might be biased .",
    "however , we can de - magnify the lensed images , using the magnification factors from the lens mass models , to calculate the intrinsic magnitudes of respective sources .",
    "these source magnitudes happen to lie well - above the limiting magnitude used in our calculation .",
    "therefore , assuming our lens mass models are correct , our calculation of expected number of lenses is less likely to be biased due to this effect . by integrating eq .",

    "degrees , down to the limiting magnitude .",
    "we adopted the following approach to find gravitational lens candidates in the gems field .",
    "as a first step , we selected all galaxies above a stellar mass of @xmath23 @xmath24 and redshift @xmath25 from the combo-17  catalog @xcite of 25  000 galaxies .",
    "massive lens galaxies are generally more efficient lenses and produce larger image separations which are easier to detect .",
    "these galaxies are also , generally , the more luminous galaxies at each redshift . as a result ,",
    "such galaxies have a high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) .",
    "the cut at @xmath26 ensures that galaxies with reliable redshifts are included in the sample .",
    "also , this limit corresponds to the redshift at which the redder @xmath0-band filter moves beyond the 4000 - break , so we would start to see pure uv images beyond this redshift .",
    "in addition to a decrease in the snr , more clumpy star forming structures show up more prominently in such cases , increasing the chance for contamination of good lens candidates with normal star - forming galaxies .",
    "these limits helped us to narrow down our search to a massive subsample of galaxies which are more likely to exhibit strong lensing signatures .",
    "the first step leaves 1225 combo-17  galaxies of which 1054 are covered with acs imaging data by the gems  survey .    in the second step ,",
    "we visually inspected the 1054 galaxies , looking at both @xmath1 color composite images as well as the two bands individually in different gray - scale stretches .",
    "this allowed us to see both the surface brightness structures as well as color - differences , if any , between the image components .",
    "we selected possible lens candidates based on the presence of a ) multiple image components or arc - like structures mimicking typical lensed image configurations , and/or b ) color differences to the main body of the central galaxy .",
    "we found 29 candidates at the end of this inspection with some being more likely lens systems than others .",
    "three people ranked these candidates visually from 1 being the least likely to 4 being very likely candidates .",
    "a total of 19 candidates had average ranks below 2 .",
    "of the remaining 10 candidates , five had average ranks between 2 and 3 and five had ranks @xmath27 .",

    "* ) with combo-17  i d 15422 .",
    "we analyze this system along with the rest of the candidates .",
    "the top five candidates with ranks @xmath27 are listed in table  [ tab : sample ] and examined in the rest of this paper whereas the five low probability candidates are described in the appendix .",
    "we use the publicly available software galfit  to model the two - dimensional light distribution in images .",
    "galfit  is a very flexible code and allows fits to the light distribution with a large choice of radial surface brightness profiles , number of distinct components , choice of psfs .",
    "galfit  in its newest version ( v3 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) allows a more flexible analysis through the possibility of applying `` bending '' modes to components and adding a banana - shaped bend to an otherwise elliptical shape .",
    "this facilitates adapting the models of the source in the presence of gravitational arcs .",
    "generally , we model all systems with one or two components for the lensing galaxy and up to four for the lensed images .",
    "the choice of component numbers is not physically motivated but was adapted to describe the whole system well enough so that the candidate lensing galaxy and the putative lensed images can be well separated .",
    "testing was done iteratively from repeated modelling runs with different numbers of components and different degrees of freedom to each component e.g.  bending modes switched on or off .",
    "the final choice is slightly subjective but the solution regarding the exact parameters , at the same time , is quite degenerate . since we do not use output model parameters from galfit  itself , but only from the extracted images , this procedure is very robust .",
    "we give the individual number of components used for each object in table  [ tab : sample ] .    for four out of five objects ,",

    "the magnitude of deflection and distortion of a light ray bundle arriving at a point in the lens plane from a background source depends upon the surface density distribution of mass in the lens . to zeroth order",
    ", the surface mass density distribution around galaxies follows a spherically symmetric singular isothermal profile ( sis ) given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the velocity dispersion of the dark matter particles , @xmath30 is the physical separation in the lens plane and @xmath31 is the gravitational constant .",
    "dark matter halos are triaxial in nature .",
    "therefore an elliptical mass distribution is a more realistic description of the surface density distribution .",

    "the lensing observables are sensitive to a quantity called convergence ( @xmath35 ) which is defined as the ratio of the surface mass density distribution to a critical surface density .",
    "the critical surface density depends upon the geometrical distances between the source , the lens , and the observer and is given by @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the speed of light , @xmath38 is the angular diameter distance between the observer and the lens , @xmath39 is the distance between the lens and the background source , and @xmath40 is the distance between the observer and the background source .    using constraints from extended images is particularly helpful when the background source is to be reconstructed for further analysis .",
    "we use the software package gravlens @xcite to make lens mass models for our candidates .",
    "the software package uses the image positions ( and optionally , their fluxes ) and the lens position along with their error bars as constraints and outputs a model that best fits the constraints . for the purpose of estimating masses of the lens galaxies , use of the surface brightness peak positions",
    "is usually sufficient . a significant improvement is not expected in the estimate of the einstein radius by using the extended surface brightness information .",
    "this is postponed until deeper imaging is obtained especially for studying the background sources .    the convergence at a point ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 ) in the sky is defined as in the gravlens manual .",
    "] @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the critical radius ( also known as the einstein radius ) . as is clear from eqs .",

    "[ mlens ] becomes unity in the case of a sis profile ( i.e. , when @xmath48 ) .",
    "in addition to the surface mass density distribution , an external shear is often added to the lens model to account for the tidal effects of the environment on the lensed image observables .",
    "the position angles in the lens models are measured east of north such that north is 0  deg and east is 90  deg .",
    "an sis model has a total of 5 free parameters : the position @xmath49 of the lens , its critical radius , and two parameters that describe the position of the source .",
    "an sie model has two additional parameters , the ellipticity ( given by @xmath50 ) and its position angle .",
    "the external shear introduces 2 more parameters , the shear strength , and its position angle , to each of these models .",
    "a doubly imaged system provides a total of 6 constraints : 4 constraints from the 2 image positions and 2 constraints from the lens position . in the absence of any constraints from the flux ratios , we only use the sis model so as to avoid an over - fit to the data",
    "similarly , a quadruply imaged system will have a total of 10 constraints : 8 constraints from the 4 image positions and remaining 2 constraints come from the lens position .",
    "this allows us to fit the data with sis+shear and sie+shear models . in case of sie+shear model ,",
    "the external shear is often found to be degenerate with the ellipticity .      using the above models , we present results from preliminary mass modelling of the lens candidates .",
    "the aim is to test if simple mass models can reproduce the configuration of lensed images with reasonable values of the model parameters .",
    "two kinds of image configurations are commonly seen in four - image lens systems , namely , a cusp and a fold . in the former ,",
    "three lensed images are highly magnified and tend to merge whereas , in the latter , any of the adjacent two images are highly magnified and tend to merge .",
    "we assume either of the above image configurations ( except for candidate 40173 which is probably doubly imaged ) for our mass models and describe the tests carried out on all of our candidates .    throughout the modelling , we use peak positions of the images and the lens galaxy as constraints for the mass models",
