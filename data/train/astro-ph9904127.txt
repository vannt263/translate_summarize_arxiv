    "simulations of the thermal evolution of neutron stars confronted with the soft x - ray and extreme uv observations of the photon flux emitted from their surface provide one of the most useful diagnostics of the physical processes operating in the dense interior of such stars .",
    "the early evolution of a neutron star is completely dominated by the cooling via neutrino emission ; at this stage the star effectively radiates away the initial content of its thermal energy . in the later epoch one faces a competition between cooling and heating processes , where the heating may even dominate in the late stages of the thermal evolution .",
    "eventually , they reach a thermal equilibrium phase , where the heat generated in the star is radiated away at the same rate from the stellar surface .",
    "the relative importance of the various elementary processes contributing to cooling is fairly well understood ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the investigations performed so far have however the deficit that they did not sufficiently clarify the relative weight of the different heating processes .",
    "the majority of these investigations concentrated on few preferred dissipation processes ( e.g @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) with the exception of the work of van riper ( 1991 ) , who treats the heating in general phenomenological terms .",
    "a meaningful comparison of the individual processes studied in these papers is strongly hampered by the fact that these investigations were performed for different microphysical inputs and different levels of sophistication concerning the cooling simulation code , preventing one from drawing definitive conclusions about the relative importance of the individual heating processes .",
    "the aim of this paper is a comparative analysis of the impact of different heating processes on the thermal evolution of neutron stars .",
    "our simulations take into account the most recent developments concerning the microphysical input and employ both relativistic and non - relativistic equations of state of superdense matter .",
    "we perform the cooling calculations for a fully relativistic , evolutionary simulation code .",
    "although internal heating is generally azimuthally asymmetric , we shall use an one - dimensional cooling code for almost all simulations . to demonstrate the reliability of this approximation ,",
    "a two - dimensional calculation is performed for a selected case as well ( @xcite ) . as far as we know , this is the first fully two - dimensional simulation of neutron star cooling which takes internal heating into account .",
    "the heating processes emerge as a response to the loss of rotational energy of the star and can be divided roughly into two groups .",
    "firstly , processes caused by the readjustment of the equilibrium structure of the compact object such as a sequence of crust / core - quakes ( @xcite and references therein ) ; nuclear reactions in cold nuclear matter with non - equilibrium composition ( picno - nuclear reactions in the crust and weak processes in the core , see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "secondly , processes related to superfluidity such as dissipative motion of the neutron vortex lattice in the superfluid crusts ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and the dissipative motion of proton vortex lattice in the superfluid core and the vorticity decay at the phase separation boundaries , e.g. at the crust - core interface , ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the rate of dissipation associated with these processes is , in most cases , intimately connected with the spin evolution of the star , in particular the evolution of its magnetic moment .",
    "the time dependence of the magnetic moment and the moment of inertia will affect the heating rate and thus the star s cooling behaviour along with the relation between the luminosity and the age of the star ; these effects are ignored in this study in order to constrain the actual number of the evolutionary scenarios ; we shall assume therefore a constant magnetic moment and moment of inertia .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "the equations of thermal and rotational evolution of a neutron star are given in sect .",
    "[ sec : equations ] .",
    "various heating processes associated with the dissipative motion of vortices and the changes of the equilibrium structure are reviewed in sects .",
    "[ sec : vortex ] and [ sec : nonequilibrium ] .",
    "additional physical input is discussed in sect .",

    "the observed data are summarised in sect .",
    "[ sec : observations ] .",
    "section [ sec : res ] presents the results of our cooling simulations which are discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : disc ] .",
    "the thermal evolution is governed by the coupled system of equations for energy balance ( @xcite ) , @xmath0 this system requires as a microphysical input the neutrino emissivity per unit volume , @xmath1 , the heat rate per unit volume , @xmath2 , the heat capacity per unit volume , @xmath3 , and the thermal conductivity , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the local density .",
    "the @xmath6 and @xmath7 components of the schwarzschild metric tensor @xmath8 are denoted by @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively , @xmath11 is the luminosity , and the other variables have their usual meaning .",
    "the boundary conditions for ( [ eq : ebal ] ) and ( [ eq : etran ] ) read @xmath12 where @xmath13 is fixed by the properties of the photosphere at the density @xmath14 ( @xcite ) .",
    "since the star s thermal evolution for times greater than , say , a few months does not depend on the detailed initial temperature profile in the interior of the star , one can choose , without loss of generality , an initialy isothermal temperature distribution of @xmath15  k. the set of equations for thermal evolution ( [ eq : ebal ] ) and ( [ eq : etran ] ) were solved numerically by means of a newton - raphson type algorithm .",
    "the microphysical input quantities needed for the solution of these equations are given in table [ tab : ingredients ] and will be discussed in detail in sect .",
    "[ sec : inp ] .",
    "if one accounts for azimuthal asymmetry of the input quantities , e.g. the heat rate @xmath16 , one has to solve two - dimensional thermal evolution equations , which have already been presented in schaab & weigel ( 1998 ) along with the numerical method for solving them .",
    "we shall start the discussion of the rotational evolution by a brief review of the spin dynamics of the normal ( non - superfluid ) component of the star .",
    "the combined effect of the braking of the star s rotation via the emission of electromagnetic radiation , electron - positron wind , and gravitational waves on the spin evolution is commonly cast in a generic power - law form @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the spin frequency of the normal component .",
    "the functional form of @xmath19 and @xmath20 depends on the dominant process assumed .",
    "if one assumes that the energy losses are due to the magnetic dipole radiation ( @xcite ) , then @xmath21 and @xmath22 is a function of the surface magnetic field strength @xmath23 , the angle @xmath24 between spin and magnetic axis , the moment of inertia of the star @xmath25 , and a correction factor @xmath26 : @xmath27 the braking index is known for the four youngest pulsars for which the measurements of the second time derivative of the period , @xmath28 , are available ( @xcite ) .",
    "all four braking indices given by @xmath29 fall into the range between 1.2 and 2.8 .",
    "the deviations from the value for the magnetic dipole radiation has been attributed to the increase of the surface magnetic field strength ( @xcite ) , an increase of the angle between the spin and magnetic moment axis ( @xcite ) , or presence of the weakly coupled superfluid in the core of the star ( @xcite ) .",
    "we shall assume , in a first approach to the problem , @xmath22 to be constant and @xmath21 .    with these assumptions , integration of eq .",
    "yields @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the initial angular velocity at @xmath32 . if the initial angular velocity is large compared to the present angular velocity , eq .",
    "simplifies to @xmath33 and the age of the pulsar can be expressed as @xmath34 apart from affecting the cooling history , the time variation of @xmath22 , as well as a deviation of the braking index from its canonical value , @xmath35 , may lead to over- or underestimating the true age by a factor as large as 3 . a comparison of the theoretical cooling tracks with observed data is therefore affected by this uncertainty ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : observations ] ) .",
    "the angular velocity of the superfluid phases adjusts to the changes in the rotation rate of the normal component via expansion or contraction of the neutron vortex lattice , which carries the angular momentum of the superfluid .",
    "the mean macroscopic density of neutron vortex lines @xmath36 in cylindrical coordinates @xmath37 is given by the feynman - onsager quantisation condition @xmath38 @xmath39 denotes the angular velocity of the superfluid component and @xmath40 is the quantum of circulation carried by each vortex , where @xmath16 denotes the planck constant and @xmath41 is the bare neutron mass . the second term accounts for the gradients in the distribution of vortex lines .",
    "because of the lack of sources and sinks for vortex lines in the bulk of the superfluid , the temporal evolution of the vortex number density obeys the number conservation law : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the velocity of vortex lines . combination of eqs . and leads to @xmath44 a decrease of the spin of the superfluid component ( @xmath45 ) causes an outward radial velocity @xmath46 . in the following we neglect the second term in parentheses and assume @xmath39 to be constant throughout the superfluid phase , since the vorticity gradients depend on the density profile of the mutual friction coefficients , which are poorly known .",
    "furthermore , over the evolutionary timescale one can assume that @xmath47 , i.e. the deceleration rates of the superfluid and the normal components are the same .",
    "then the velocity of the radial motion of the vortices ( and therefore the rate of dissipation ) are related to the spin - down characteristics of the normal component via eq . .",
    "in this manner the dynamics of superfluid phases is eliminated from the system of coupled equations of secular and thermal evolution , and the heating rates are given directly in terms the spin characteristics of the normal component .",
    "we next turn to the description of the dissipation processes included in the thermal evolution simulations .",
    "a number of dynamical coupling regimes has been suggested in the literature for the coupling of the superfluid component to the crusts .",
    "we shall discuss several variants of the two main alternatives - the pinned and the corotation regimes .",
    "the vortex creep theories of the dynamics of neutron vortices in the inner crust assume these vortices to be pinned to the nuclear lattice ( @xcite ) .",
    "the pinning force provides a large resistive force to the vortex motion which is necessary to spin down the superfluid component . in this regime ,",
    "the vortices move due to the process of vortex creep , i.e. by thermal activation from one pinning configuration to another .",
    "the vortex creep rate has the general form ( @xcite ) @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a microscopic velocity , @xmath50 denotes the activation energy for a segment of a vortex line to overcome its pinning barrier , and @xmath51 is the effective temperature which includes quantum tunnelling effects and is a function of the local temperature of the thermal bath .",
    "these quantities depend on microscopic parameters ( e.g. the pinning energy ) , which themselves depend on the density , and on the velocity difference between the superfluid and the normal component @xmath52 . since the creep rate @xmath53 is given by eq . , eq . has to be inverted to obtain the velocity difference @xmath54 .",
    "this is done by an iterative procedure similar to the one described by van riper et al .",
    "( 1995 ) .",
    "the rotational energy of the superfluid is converted to thermal energy by the radial motion of the vortices .",
    "the energy dissipated by a single vortex per unit time is @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the radial component of the magnus force .",
    "the dissipated energy @xmath16 per unit time and volume is then given by : @xmath57 where eq . has been used .",
    "the integration over the volume of the superfluid component gives : @xmath58 this result guarantees conservation of both energy and angular momentum .",
    "for the implementation of @xmath16 in our one - dimensional cooling code , @xmath16 has to be averaged over spherical shells : @xmath59 where we assumed that @xmath52 is approximately constant on spherical shells .",
    "this approximation seems to be reliable because @xmath52 depends only logarithmically on @xmath60 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we shall consider two models for pinning : the first model ( eb ) uses the parameters from epstein & baym ( 1988 ) and link & epstein ( 1991 ) , where the pinning energy is derived from the ginzburg - landau theory . in the second model ( pvb )",
    "the parameters are derived by pizzochero et al .",
    "( 1997 ) from the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer theory of superconductivity .",
    "below the density @xmath61 the parameters for the both models do not deviate considerably .",
    "however , above densities @xmath62 the large deviations in the pinning energy ( the typical pinning energy is @xmath63 in the eb model and @xmath64 in the pvb model ) leads to rather different evolutionary scenarios and , therefore , we shall treat both models seperately .",
    "the dynamics of the neutron vortices in the corotating regime is governed by the force balance equation @xmath65 where the magnus and the drag ( resistive ) forces are : @xmath66 with the drag coefficient @xmath67 .",
    "a decomposition of the force balance equation into radial and azimuthal components gives @xmath68 where the dissipation angle @xmath69 , following bildsten & epstein ( 1989 ) , is defined as @xmath70 the rate of the dissipation per unit volume is then given by @xmath71 with the abbreviation @xmath72 here , @xmath73 denotes the fraction of the free ( corotating ) vortices . this quantity is largely unknown , but",
    "for stationary situations , one may assume that definite crustal regions support either corotation or creep regimes and the mixing is small .",
    "hence we shall adopt @xmath74 for the corotating regime .    the dominant processes in this regime result from the coupling of the translational motion of the vortices to the electron - phonon system ( @xcite ) .",
    "the leading order coupling implies a resistive force constant @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the lattice constant , @xmath77 the pinning energy , @xmath78 the neutron coherence length , @xmath79 the ( effective ) mass of the nuclei , and @xmath80 the phonon velocity ( given by the unperturbed dispersion relation ) . using eq .",
    "( [ eta0 ] ) we find @xmath81 g @xmath82 s@xmath83 at the density @xmath84 g @xmath85 and , therefore , @xmath86 .",
    "the processes corresponding to higher orders in the vortex displacement are generally velocity dependent .",
    "the next - to - leading order term , involving one - phonon processes , is estimated as ( @xcite ) @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the kelvon velocity due to excitation of the oscillatory degrees of freedom of the vortex lines moving with velocity @xmath89 .",
    "this process is sensitive to the actual excitation spectrum of kelvons .",
    "the possible localisation of kelvons in a random nuclear potential ( @xcite ) leads to a threshold in the excitation spectrum beyond which a continuum of states becomes available for excitations .",
    "in addition one requires knowledge of the scattering amplitudes beyond the born approximation . for typical parameters",
    "one finds @xmath90 g @xmath82 s@xmath83 at a density of @xmath91 g @xmath85 , and , therefore , @xmath92 .",
    "however , in the stationary situations , the vortex velocities are rather small , and we shall assume that the leading term @xmath93 is the dominant one in the corotating regime .",
    "an estimate of the heating processes in the superfluid core requires knowledge of vortex lattice structure that nucleates after the superfluid phase transition .",
    "we shall pursue the point of view that the core s magnetic field nucleates in a proton vortex lattice .",
    "the frictional forces in a neutron star s core are dominated by the scattering of the quasiparticle excitations of the electron normal fermi - liquid by the proton vortex lattice .",
    "the reason is that the number of proton vortices per neutron vortex , given by @xmath94 , is of the order of @xmath95 for @xmath96 g and a neutron vortex lattice constant of @xmath97 cm .",
    "the dominant dissipative scattering results from the scattering of electron excitations off the quasiparticle excitations confined in the core of proton vortex lines .",
    "the scattering rate is a sensitive function of the form - factor of the vortex line core and the actual distribution of vortex lines ( e.g. formation of vortex clusters , @xcite ) .",
    "an order - of - magnitude estimate of the dissipation rate is given by ( @xcite ) @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the temperature , @xmath100 the radius of the superfluid core and @xmath101 is defined as .",
    "@xmath102 where @xmath103 denotes the proton fermi momentum , @xmath104 the thomas - fermi screening length , @xmath105 the proton quasiparticle energy with the proton effective mass @xmath106 , @xmath107 the entrainment coefficient , and @xmath108 the proton coherence length and the magnetic field penetration length , respectively .",
    "it should be noted that the dynamical coupling of the proton vortex clusters to the electron liquid is controlled by the electron flux - scattering processes , whose rate is larger than that for the electron scattering off the vortex core quasiparticles . while in the latter case",
    "the scattering is inelastic ( i.e. energy is transfered to the proton quasiparticle localised in the vortex core ) , the former process of electron - flux scattering is predominantly elastic i.e. involves only a change of direction of the electron momentum ( but no changes in the energy ) . in the classical ( or quasi - classical ) limit this process corresponds to the bending of the electron trajectory in the magnetic field of a vortex under the action of the lorentz force and is manifestly non - dissipative . in the quantum limit",
    "the processes of the soft - photon emission can not be dismissed in general ; however the corresponding rates should be substantially less than the elastric scattering rates .",
    "the proton vortices , which are dragged along by the neutron vortex motion in the radial outward direction to the crust  core boundary , would decay as they merge in the crust , thus releasing their self - energy .",
    "the relevant crust - core boundary for this process should be identified with the phase transition point between the phase with protons bound in heavy nuclei and the phase in which they are in continuum states .",
    "since the crustal matter can not support a proton supercurrent , the circulation currents of proton vortices would decay on the ohmic dissipation timescale , which is much smaller than a star s spin - down time scale .",
    "the resulting heating rate at the crust - core boundary is given by @xmath109 with @xmath110 here , @xmath111 is the flux quantum .",
    "the quantity @xmath112 is very sensitive to variations of the microphysical parameters such as the proton density , the effective mass , and the gap energy at the location of the phase transition point .",
    "we use a fixed upper limit for this process corresponding to the value of @xmath113 .",
    "as a neutron star spins down its global structure readjusts itself toward a more spherically symmetric configuration to minimise the sum of gravitational and rotational energy .",
    "two models of internal heating discussed here are based on the structural readjustment of the oblateness of the star , defined as @xmath114 and of the central baryon density @xmath115 .",
    "@xmath116 denotes the star s moment of inertia .",
    "the equilibrium values of both quantities are determined as functions of the angular velocity by computing a sequence of rotating neutron star models with constant baryon number ( @xcite ) .",
    "these calculations are done by solving the general relativistic stellar structure equations in two dimensions , in a similar manner as in komatsu et al .",
    "( 1989 ) and bonazzola et al .",
    "( 1993 ) . as an example",
    "the oblateness @xmath117 and the fraction @xmath118 with the central density @xmath119 are plotted for a neutron star model with constant baryon mass @xmath120 in fig .",
    "[ fig : rot ] .",
    "the underlying equation of state is the non - relativistic uv@xmath121+uvii - model ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : inp.eos ] ) .      if both the interior and the crust are liquid , the oblateness will continuously adjusts itself to the equilibrium value .",
    "this is the case for the temperatures @xmath122  k ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , if the crust solidifies , the oblateness continuously depart from its equilibrium value causing an increasing mean stress on the crust according to ( @xcite ) @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the mean shear modulus of the crust .",
    "the quantity @xmath125 refers to the equilibrium value of the oblateness .",
    "if the mean stress @xmath126 reaches some critical value @xmath127 the crust breaks and the deviation of @xmath117 from its equilibrium value is reduced . for an ideal coulomb lattice ,",
    "the value of the critical shear angle @xmath128 is of the order of magnitude @xmath129 ( @xcite )",
    ". the fraction of impurities or defects in the neutron star crusts could be considerable due to , e.g. , the fast cooling below the melting temperature of the lattice . smolukowski ( 1970 ) argues that the value of @xmath128 is then reduced to roughly @xmath130 .    during the breaking of the crust",
    "the strain energy @xmath131 is released ( @xcite ) , where @xmath132 is the change in @xmath133 , and the coefficient @xmath23 is given in terms of the mean shear modulus by @xmath134 with @xmath135 being the volume of the crust .",
    "we follow cheng et al .",
    "( 1992 ) in assuming that @xmath133 is approximately equal to its maximum value @xmath128 and that the time @xmath136 between two successive quakes is small compared to the time scale of thermal evolution .",
    "hence , which is @xmath137 for slowly rotating stars .",
    "we therefore obtain no effect on the cooling of slowly rotating stars , in contrast to cheng et al .",

[",
    "fig : rot ] ) . as the star spins down , the centrifugal force decreases and correspondingly the central density increases ( by up to 20  % ) .",
    "this is accompanied by a shift of the chemical equilibrium .",
    "the matter would maintain chemical equilibrium if the relaxation timescales for the weak processes are small compared to the timescale of rotational evolution .",
    "however , these timescales are found to be comparable and the actual composition departs from chemical equilibrium , which modifies the reaction rates ( @xcite ) and usually leads to a net conversion of chemical energy into thermal energy ( @xcite ) .    for simplicity",

    "this relation requires that both the moment of inertia and the magnetic surface field are constant , and that the braking index @xmath145 is equal to its canonical value of 3 , which corresponds to a spin - down by emission of pure magnetic dipole radiation ( see sect .",

    "[ sec : res.recycled ] .",
    "the effective surface temperature is increased in both models in a similar way , though the effect of the eb - pinning model is larger because of the larger pinning energy in the inner crust .",
    "the heating of the crust can easily be recognised by the increase of the thermal diffusion time , i.e. by the amount of time needed for the cooling wave to reach the surface ( @xcite ) . after this time the surface temperature drops significantly .",
    "it is increased by a factor of @xmath198 ( @xmath199 ) in the case of eb- ( pvb-)pinning . this characteristic feature will become very interesting if the thermal spectrum of a young pulsar @xmath200 should be detected .    for @xmath201 the slope of the cooling track is increased by the heating of the crust .",
    "the observed upper limit of the effective surface temperature of psr 0950 + 08 seems to rule out the eb - pinning model .",

    "are in contrast to the ones reported by cheng et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , where a significant effect especially during the late cooling epoch has been obtained .",

    "the eb - pinning model shows again the largest effect on the surface temperature .    with the only exception of psr 0630 + 18 ( geminga ) ,",
    "the effective surface temperatures of the pulsars of category a are clearly not consistent with the enhanced cooling models , no matter whether one includes heating processes or not .",

    "is substantially reduced .",
    "this yields a high effective surface temperature in the neutrino cooling era , during which the energy loss rate depends on the internal temperature ; whereas it yields small surface temperatures in the photon cooling era where the loss rate depends on the surface temperature itself .    as it was already noted , the enhanced cooling models are now in better agreement with the data of observation class a ( see fig .

    "in particular , the mechanism of chemical heating and crust cracking then becomes efficient enough to noticeably influence the thermal evolution . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cool6 ] we show the results for the various heating mechanism in comparison with models without heating . since the late cooling behaviour ( for @xmath210  yr ) does not depend on the cooling scenario , we consider here only the standard cooling scenario .",
    "the model with chemical heating of the core shows a sudden rise of the surface temperature at @xmath211  yr .",
    "this is caused by the release of chemical energy through the @xmath143-decay of neutrons .",
    "this process is suppressed by superfluidity if the deviation from chemical equilibrium is smaller than the gap energy ( s. sect .",
    "[ sec : chem ] and @xcite ) .",
    "all cooling tracks in fig .",
    "[ fig : cool6 ] are consistent with the upper temperature limits of the three oldest millisecond pulsars .",
    "only the observation of psr 0751 + 18 seems to exclude the eb - pinning model .",
    "the situation changes however if one assumes that the actual temperatures are not too far from the upper limits .",
    "then only the pvb- and eb - pinning models , as well as the chemical heating of the superfluid core yield sufficiently high surface temperature . a future temperature determination , which will set a firm lower limit on the temperature for one of these pulsars could therefore rule out at least the corotation and the crust cracking models as the only heat sources in millisecond pulsars .      in this section",
    "we relax the simplification that the heating rates are angle independent and extend our one - dimensional calculations of the previous sections to the two - dimensional case .",
    "the averaging of the local heating rates over spherical shells assumes that the heat conductivity is very high in transverse direction .",
    "this is indeed a fairly good approximation , as we shall see next by comparing the results of one dimensional calculation with those of fully two - dimensional ones .",
    "the two - dimensional code was developed recently by schaab & weigel ( 1998 ) ( s.a .",
    "@xcite ) .    fig .",
    "[ fig : cool8 ] shows the obtained cooling tracks for standard cooling computed for the uv@xmath121+uvii  model with inclusion of the eb - pinning model .",
    "heating leads to a large temperature difference ( up to 50% ) between the pole ( @xmath212 ) and the equator ( @xmath213 ) for a pulsar whose age lies in the range @xmath214  yr . moreover the temperature drop at the equator is delayed by the heating with respect to the model without heating and with respect to the drop of the polar temperature .",
    "this is the result of the @xmath215 dependence for the vortex creep model .",
    "the surface temperature obtained with the one dimensional code can be compared with the effective temperature which is defined by ( @xcite ) @xmath216 where @xmath217 .",
    "the emission angle @xmath218 is related to the colatitude @xmath219 by the equation @xmath220 where @xmath79 and @xmath100 are the neutron star s mass and radius , respectively . in",
    "flat spacetime , equation simplifies to @xmath221 .",
    "the effective temperature @xmath51 and the surface temperature obtained with the one dimensional code are almost identical ( see fig . [",
    "fig : cool8 ] ) .",
    "this means that the luminosity obtained with both codes are also identical .",
    "the results of the one dimensional codes are thus acceptable for a comparison with the observed data of categories b  d , where the upper bounds on the surface temperature are derived from the respective luminosity .",
    "if one uses spectral information as for the pulsars in category a , the observations should be compared with the spectra derived from the surface temperature distribution @xmath222 in the framework of two dimensional simulations .",
    "nevertheless , we expect that the conclusions remain unchanged if we use the effective temperature also for a comparison with the observed data of category a.",
    "in this work , we have carried out a comparative analysis of the impact of different competing heating processes on the cooling behaviour of neutron stars . in general",
    "we find that the internal heating yields significantly enhanced surface temperatures of middle aged and old pulsars , as one would expect .",
    "however , the effectiveness of these heating processes varies significantly from one process to another , and depends sensitively on the value of the rotational parameter @xmath22 .",
    "we studied models with two different rotational parameters .",
    "the first value was chosen to amount @xmath223  s , which is supported by pulsars observations . for this @xmath22 value , the heating due to thermal creep of pinned vortices and motion of proton vortices in the interior of the star yield considerable enhancements of the surface temperatures of middle aged pulsars with respect to the models which ignore heating .",
    "this leads to closer agreement with the observed data in the case of enhanced cooling , which is even more improved for the case of the fully accreted envelopes ( s.a .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the observed upper temperature limit for psr 0950 + 08 seems to rule out the strong pinning models , whereas the weaker pinning models are consistent with the observations ( the pinning models differ by the value of the pinning energy in the inner crust ) .",
    "the other heating processes  from chemical heating to dissipative motion of neutron vortices in the crust to crust cracking  have no observable effect on the cooling .",
    "our result for heating due to crust cracking is in contrast to the one obtained by cheng et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , who find a large effect especially on the late cooling stages .",
    "the difference arises from different expressions adopted for the heating rates .",
    "the four oldest pulsars of our sample rotate very fast with periods of a few milliseconds .",
    "hence the rotational parameter for millisecond pulsars is smaller than that for the bulk fraction of the population by 7 orders of magnitude ( @xmath224  s ) . for this value",
    "only the late cooling stages are affected by heating .",
    "we find that the heating due to thermal creep of pinned vortices and chemical heating of the core has the largest impact on the surface temperatures of millisecond pulsars .",
    "again , the strong pinning models leads to surface temperatures which are larger than one of the upper limits deduced for the millisecond pulsars .",
    "as far as we know , the published cooling simulations of neutron stars which account for internal heating were performed in one spatial dimension .",
    "such a treatment is only possible if the angle dependent heating rates are averaged over spherical shells . by comparing the outcome of one - dimensional simulations with fully two - dimensional simulations , based on a recently developed numerical code ( @xcite ) , we could confirm the validity of this procedure .",
    "the knowledge of the input parameters for cooling simulations such as the composition , the superfluid gap energies , and the possible existence of an accreted envelope , etc .",
    "is far form being complete .",
    "the number of parameters involved in the cooling simulations increases when the internal heating processes are taken into account . in principal",
    ", one could expect to derive some of the parameters associated with these phenomena by means of comparing the theoretical cooling models with the body of observed data .",
    "this attempt needs to be supplemented with the analysis of terrestical experiments , other astrophysical observations , as well as future theoretical studies .",
    "nevertheless , the observed data already constrain the microphysical input , as , for instance , for the scenaria of heating via vortex creep .    tables containing detailed references to the ingredients used in the simulations , the observational data , and the resulting cooling tracks can be found on the web : http://www.physik.uni-muenchen.de/sektion/suessmann/astro/cool .",
