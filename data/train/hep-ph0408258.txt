    "the purpose of this paper is to assess the possibility of detecting certain tetraquarks in present and future facilities . among many possible tetraquarks , the double charm tetraquark @xmath1 with quantum numbers",
    "@xmath2 is particularly interesting since it is very sensitive to the chosen effective interaction :    * it is very delicate , it is either weakly bound or slightly unbound with respect to the two - body hadronic decay @xmath3 .",
    "* its structure can be either predominantly `` molecular '' or predominantly `` atomic '' with consequences for the production and decay .",
    "double charm tetraquarks were intensively studied by many authors .",
    "various approaches were applied , from lattice qcd and chiral heavy quark effective theories to nonrelativistic potential models .",
    "it was shown that , although the predictions of these theories agree in the barion and meson sector , they give dramatically different results for tetraquarks . for this reason , the double charm tetraquarks present an important laboratory for discriminating between different hadronic models .",
    "moreover , our estimates for the production cross section of such states gives us some hope that they can be experimentally detected in near future .",
    "the most important ingredient in the production of the @xmath4 tetraquark is double charm production .",
    "experimental data for such events are very puzzling .",
    "the production of prompt @xmath5 at @xmath6 factories as well as the production of @xmath7 at selex are much larger than expected .",
    "therefore the comparison of @xmath4 production with @xmath8 at b factories and the comparison @xmath4 production with @xmath7 at selex could shed some new light on the mechanism responsible for such large double charm production .    in section 2",
    "we presents our results for the @xmath4 production at high energy colliders were we believe that the dominant mechanism for the initial double charm production is double gluon fusion . from experimental data we also estimate phenomenologically the production of the @xmath4 tetraquark at b factories and at selex .",
    "the results of detailed four body calculations in nonrelativistic constituent quark model ( section 3 ) encourage us to further investigate this state .",
    "since we found the @xmath4 tetraquark to be weakly bound , we propose ( section 4 ) the branching ratio between hadronic and radiative decays as the most promising mechanism for the detection of these states .",
    "the most promising mechanism for the production of the @xmath4 tetraquark is the formation of the @xmath9 diquark followed by hadronisation into @xmath10 .",
    "an alternative mechanism would exploit binding of @xmath11 and @xmath12 mesons if when they are produced with small relative momenta .",
    "one might expect that the latter mechanism could drastically enlarge the production rate if the dominant configuration is molecular .",
    "due to the very messy environment in hadron colliders , however , such a weakly bound system would too soon dissociate into free mesons by the interaction with surrounding partons of initial hadrons .",
    "the first step is to create two @xmath13 pairs with the @xmath14 quarks close in the phase space and in colour antisymmetric state , so that in the second step they bind into the @xmath15 diquark .",
    "the binding energy of such a system is @xmath16 200 mev @xcite . in the third step the diquark",
    "gets dressed either with a light @xmath17 or @xmath18 quark into a @xmath19 or @xmath20 baryon or with a light @xmath21 antidiquark into the @xmath10 tetraquark .",
    "the probabilities for this two types of dressing can be estimated using the analogy of a single heavy quark fragmentation .",
    "the branching ratio of the @xmath22 and @xmath23 production at the fermilab and at lep experiment is 0.9 and 0.1 @xcite , respectively , therefore we expect the same ratio in the hadronisation @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "the double charmed baryons were probably detected at selex @xcite .",
    "it was estimated that @xmath26 of the singly charmed baryons they see result from the decay of doubly charmed baryons .",
    "the most probable mechanism for the double charm production at selex is production of the single @xmath13 pair in the processes @xmath27 or @xmath28 while the second @xmath13 pair is created in the fragmentation of the heavy quark @xmath29 .",
    "however , theoretically it is still unclear why the selex has such a large cross section for double charm production .",
    "since selex is a fixed target experiment the @xmath15 diquark is most likely to be produced with high lab momenta which might be helpful in the detection as discussed in @xcite .",
    "but since selex found , with their cuts , only about fifty candidates for double charmed baryons , the statistics for detecting double charmed tetraquarks should be improved .",
    "next , we look at the production and detection of the @xmath4 tetraquark in b - factories . since the total mass of four @xmath30 mesons is close to the c.m .",
    "energy , the @xmath31 quarks created in this process have small relative momenta which is very important in @xmath4 production .",
    "this feature also ensures a smaller number of additional pions created in the @xmath32 annihilation and thus a cleaner reconstruction of @xmath4 .",
    ", @xcite has reported a measurement of prompt @xmath5 production in @xmath33 annihilation at @xmath34 = 10.6 gev and found that the most of the observed @xmath5 production is due to the double @xmath13 production @xmath35 which correspond to @xcite , @xcite @xmath36 or to about 2000 events from their 46.2 fb@xmath37 data sample . the theoretical nonrelativistic qcd prediction for this process",
    "is an order of magnitude smaller @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , so this process is still not well understood @xcite . but",
    "it is very likely that the analogous mechanism would also enlarge the cross section for the prompt production of @xmath15 diquark and thus the @xmath7 baryon and @xmath4 tetraquark .",
    "the @xmath15 diquark production cross section can then be estimated to be @xmath16 0.15 pb , which correspond to @xmath16 @xmath38 @xmath7 @xcite and about @xmath16 @xmath39 @xmath4 per year .",
    "we now present our calculation for the @xmath4 production at high energy colliders .",
    "the two colliding nucleons in tev machines can be considered as two packages of virtual gluons whose number is huge for low bjorken-@xmath40 .",
    "therefore we expect @xcite , @xcite that in these facilities the dominant mechanism for double charm production would be a double gluon - gluon fusion : @xmath41 .",
    "the usual hard production mechanism is heavy quark production followed by fragmentation , however this mechanism does not include all the possible feynman diagrams . in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xcite it has been shown that at high energy collider a significant rate of events with double heavy quark pairs is expected . to compute all the fourth order @xmath42 feynman diagrams we have to consider the two different mechanisms leading to the same final state : the usual single parton scatterings and the double parton scatterings .",
    "at high energy in single parton interactions the partonic sub - process is dominated by the gluon - gluon fusion @xmath43 while the double parton interactions are dominated by the process @xmath41 where the two distinct interactions occur in the same hadronic event .",
    "we give an estimate of the production cross section at high energy in the region of small transverse momenta where the multiple parton interactions provide the leading contribution to the cross section @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we compute the production cross section of two @xmath31-quarks , @xmath44 , very close in momentum space @xmath45,@xmath46 @xmath47 , as a function of @xmath48 .",
    "we consider the heavy quark production in the kinematical range of the lhcb @xmath49 , and for completeness for the alice @xmath50 , tevatron @xmath51 and rhic @xmath52 experiments ; in the last case we calculate also the production cross sections in proton - nucleus interactions @xcite .",
    "the results are shown in fig [ sl0 ] one can notice that the cross section @xmath53 at small @xmath48 is almost uniform and then it is approximately proportional to the momentum volume @xmath54",
    ".    in the second step , the two @xmath14 quarks join into a diquark .",
    "we assume simultaneous production of two independent c quarks with momenta @xmath55 .",
    "since they appear wherever within the nucleon volume , we modulate their wave functions with a gaussian profile with the `` oscillator parameter '' @xmath56 fm corresponding to the nucleon rms radius @xmath57 where the normalisation factor @xmath58 here @xmath59 is the average distance between two nucleons in the target nucleus for proton - nucleus experiment at rhic and we use the value @xmath60 fm or zero otherwise .",
    "we make an impulse approximation that this two - quark state is instantaneously transformed in any of the eigenstates of the two - quark hamiltonian .",
    "then the amplitude of the diquark formation @xmath61 is equal to the overlap between the two free quarks and the diquark with the same centre - of - mass motion . by approximating the diquark wave function with a gaussian with the oscillator parameter @xmath62 fm we get @xmath63    for the production cross section we take into account that @xmath64 is practically constant and can be taken out of the integral @xmath65 where factors in front of the integral are due to the projection on the colour and spin triplet states .",
    "if we insert the values of @xmath66 obtained from the fig [ sl0 ] , we get @xmath67 nb and @xmath68 nb for lhcb and alice at lhc , @xmath69 nb at tevatron and @xmath70 nb and @xmath71 nb at rhic for proton - proton and proton - nucleus interaction , respectively .",
    "the last step of the @xmath4 production is dressing of the heavy diquark .",
    "it either acquires one light quark to become the doubly - heavy baryon ccu , ccd or ccs , or two light antiquarks to become a tetraquark . with this",
    "we neglect the possible dissociation of the heavy diquark into a @xmath72 pair so the results are the upper estimate for the real @xmath4 production . assuming that the probability for dressing the @xmath15 diquark into the @xmath73 tetraquark is 0.1 @xcite , as pointed out at the beginning of the section , yields the production rate of the dimeson 20900 , 9700 , 600 and 1 events / hour for lhc at luminosity @xmath74 @xmath75s@xmath37 , tevatron at luminosity @xmath76 @xmath75s@xmath37 and rhic at @xmath77 luminosity @xmath78 @xmath75s@xmath37 , respectively .",
    "the structure of the @xmath79 tetraquark has been studied in ref . @xcite .",
    "we summarize here those features which are particularly relevant for the detection .",
    "there are two extreme spatial configurations of quarks in a tetraquark .",
    "the first configuration which we call _ atomic _ is similar to @xmath80 , with a compact @xmath9 diquark instead of @xmath81 , around which the two light antiquarks are moving in a similar manner as in the @xmath82 baryon . the second configuration which we call _ molecular _ resembles deuteron ,",
    "the two heavy quarks are well separated and the two light antiquarks are bound to them as if we had two almost free mesons .",
    "the atomic configuration is more likely to appear in strongly bound tetraquarks while the molecular configuration can be expected in weakly bound systems .",
    "we present results using two different one - gluon exchange potentials .",
    "the bhaduri potential @xcite quite successfully describes the spectroscopy of the meson , as well as baryon ground states .",
    "this is an important condition since in the tetraquarks we have both quark - quark and quark - antiquark interactions .",
    "the al1 potential @xcite slightly improves the meson spectra by introducing a mass - dependent smearing of the colour - magnetic term .",
    "we expand tetraquark wave function with gaussinas of three sets of jaccobi coordinates . in this basis",
    "we were able to reconstruct the wave functions of deeply bound tetraquarks as well as of two free mesons - the threshold state .",
    "this is important if one is searching for weakly bound tetraquarks with molecular structure .",
    "we found that the @xmath4 is weakly bound for both the bhaduri and al1 potential in contrast to the results of calculations in harmonic oscillator basis @xcite where asymptotic channel can not be accommodated as shown in table [ tabela1 ] .",
    ".column 1 : type of potential , column 2 : lowest meson - meson threshold for a given potential in mev , column 3 : our results in mev , column 4 : results in mev of ref.@xcite , column 5 : mean distance in fm between two heavy quarks @xmath83 .

    "[ t1 ] we present the probability densities @xmath84 for finding ( anti)quark @xmath85 and ( anti)quark @xmath86 at the interquark distance @xmath87 and the ratio of the projections on colour sextet state @xmath88 and colour triplet state @xmath89 where e.g. @xmath90 here particles 1 and 2 are the two heavy quarks @xmath14 and particles 3 and 4 the light antiquarks @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "the wave function between heavy quarks is broad and has an exponential tail @xmath93 at large distances where @xmath94 , @xmath95 is the binding energy of the system and @xmath96 the reduced mass of the @xmath11 and @xmath12 mesons . at small distances",
    "the dominant colour configuration is @xmath97 .",
    "here we have a diquark - antidiquark structure and this region present about a third of the total probability while for @xmath98 fm sextet colour configuration become larger .",
    "the ratio of these two configurations stabilise at 2 , since here we have a molecular structure of the two colour singlet mesons which has in diquark antidiquark basis @xmath99 colour decomposition , while octet configuration @xmath100 is negligible .    , of the two light antiquarks @xmath101 and of a light antiquark and a heavy quark @xmath102 in @xmath4 as a function of the interquark distance .",
    "the ratio of the projection on colour sextet and colour triplet configurations is also shown . ]",
    "now we show that additional weak three - body interaction can transform the molecular structure of the @xmath4 tetraquark into atomic . for the radial part",
    "we take the simplest possible radial dependence  the smeared delta function of the coordinates of the three interacting particles @xcite .",
    "the colour factor in the two - body bhaduri or al1 potential is proportional to the first ( quadratic ) casimir operator c@xmath103 ; c@xmath104 .",
    "it is then natural that we introduce in the three - body potential the second c@xmath105 ( cubic ) casimir operator c@xmath106 .",
    "a deeper discussion of the properties that the colour dependent three - body interaction must fulfil can be found in @xcite .    in the baryon sector",
    "the three - body interaction was used to better reproduce the baryon ground state spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "a colour structure is there irrelevant since there is only one colour singlet state and thus the colour factor is just a constant which can be included into the strength of the potential . in tetraquarks",
    "the situation is different since there are two colour singlet states : @xmath107 and @xmath108 ( or @xmath109 and @xmath110 after recoupling ) .",
    "the three - body force operates differently on these two states and one can anticipate that in the case of the weak binding it can produce large changes in the structure of the tetraquark .",
    "this can not be otherwise produced simply by reparameterization of the two - body potential , so the weakly bound tetraquarks are a very important laboratory for studying the effect of such an interaction .",
    "a drastic change in the width of the probability density can already be seen for strength @xmath111 = -20 mev ( fig .",
    "[ sl3body ] ) , where the binding energy of the tetraquark becomes - 14 mev for bhaduri potential . here",
    "@xmath4 loses the molecular structure , the triplet - triplet colour configurations become dominant and the @xmath4 tetraquark becomes similar to @xmath112 . in the baryon sector",
    "such an interaction would merely lower the states by about @xmath111 so it would have no dramatic effect nor would it spoil the fit to experimental data . since the predicted energies of ground state baryons for the bhaduri and al1 potential are above the experimental values , this is actually a desirable feature .     in the @xmath4 tetraquark as a function of interquark distance for three different values of the strength of the three - body potential . ]",
    "in order to identify a weakly bound @xmath4 tetraquark we have to distinguish the pion or photon emitted by the @xmath113 meson bound inside the tetraquark from the one resulting from free @xmath12 meson decay .",
    "we can exploit the fact that the phase space for @xmath114 decay is very small .",
    "this has a strong impact on the branching ratio between radiative and hadronic decay .",
    "since the @xmath113 meson inside the tetraquark with molecular structure is not significantly influenced by the other d meson in the tetraquark , we expect that the partial width for the magnetic dipole m1 transition would be very close to the width of the free meson while the width for hadronic @xmath114 decay will decrease with stronger binding and will become energetically forbidden below the @xmath115 threshold .",
    "the hadronic decay of the @xmath4 tetraquark is a three - body decay which is commonly represented by the dalitz plot .    . ]",
    "tetraquark obtained with integration of the dalitz plot @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the mass of the tetraquark .",
    "the width at @xmath118 is normalized to be equal to the width of the free @xmath12 meson decay . ]",
    "if the @xmath4 tetraquark is below the @xmath119 threshold but above the @xmath120 and @xmath121 , as was the case in our nonrelativistic potential models , the partial decay rate for the @xmath122d+d+@xmath123 is given by @xmath124 where particles 1 and 2 are two final @xmath11 mesons and particle 3 is a @xmath123 emerging from the decaying tetraquark . here",
    "@xmath125 and @xmath126 and m is the mass of the tetraquark . since the total masses of the @xmath127 and @xmath128 are so close there is a strong isospin violation in the decay which can not be reproduced with the bhaduri or al1 potential where the @xmath113 and the @xmath11 isospin doublets are degenerate .",
    "we shall not try to modify the interaction to accommodate the dependence of the decay on the isospin of the particles , but we shall rather work with the experimental masses taken from the pdg @xcite where we see that @xmath129 the allowed region of integration over @xmath130 and @xmath131 for three different binding energies is plotted in fig .",
    "if we assume @xmath132 is constant , which is very plausible in our case , the allowed region will be uniformly populated with experimental events so that the measured partial decay rate @xmath133 will be proportional to the kinematically allowed area from fig .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ slb ] , where we assumed that for the molecular state , the width of the @xmath4 tetraquark with zero binding energy would be the same as the width of the free @xmath12 meson .",
    "let us now consider also the posibility that @xmath4 is not a bound @xmath134 state but a resonant state above the @xmath3 threshold .",
    "then if the resonance is situated near the threshold , there will be a significant fraction of hadronic @xmath135 decays beside the @xmath136 decay .",
    "this region of positive binding energy is also presented in fig .",
    "[ sla ] and fig .",
    "[ slb ] .",
    "in order to estimate the decay width we make a comparison with charmonium .",
    "the charmonium state @xmath137 has the width of @xmath138 mev and is 36 mev above @xmath139 threshold , which is also the dominant decay mode .",
    "let us assume , that the @xmath4 tetraquark resonant state , which would be 36 mev above the @xmath119 threshold would have the same partial width for the decay into @xmath11 and @xmath12 meson the area of the integrated dalitz plot for the binding energy @xmath140 mev is then 37 times larger then at the threshold @xmath141 . since the experimental width for @xmath142 is @xmath143 kev @xcite we can estimate that the decay width for the @xmath144 three - body decay would be @xmath145 mev .",
    "so we expect about 15@xmath146 direct @xmath147 decays . the dalitz plot would not be uniformly populated but there will be a strong band where @xmath148 reflecting the appearance of the @xmath149 decay chain . in this estimation",
    "we have neglected the interference between these two decay mechanism , since the width of the @xmath12 is three orders of magnitude smaller then the width of the tetraquark .",
    "we have shown that the @xmath79 tetraquark production is comparable to double charm baryon production ( possibly 10% ) . therefore they may be seen in selex if statistics is improved .",
    "similarly , it is comparable to prompt @xmath150 production which is reasonably abundant in @xmath6-factories . in high energy colliders",
    "we may expect an optimistic number of events due to double @xmath151 production via double two - gluon fusion ( see sect.2 ) .",
    "therefore time has come to start the hunt !    regarding the detection of the @xmath152 tetraquark we propose a nice opportunity  the very small phase space of the @xmath142 decay which is very sensitive to the binding energy of @xmath12 to @xmath30 .",
    "one possibility would be to measure the branching ratio between the pionic and gamma decay of @xmath153 .",
