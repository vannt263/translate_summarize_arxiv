    "the development of modern microelectronics devices requires the knowledge of the electronic structure near interfaces . in this respect ,",
    "oxide materials combine many of the important properties of semiconductors and add novel phases such as metal - insulator transitions @xcite , superconductivity @xcite , quantum hall effect @xcite , orbital reconstruction @xcite , colossal magnetoresistance @xcite , etc .",
    "one interesting phenomena reported recently is the change in the properties of complex oxides when they are arranged in a heterostructure .",
    "for example , laalo@xmath1 ( lao ) and srtio@xmath1 ( sto ) are both insulators and non - magnetic in their bulk form but one possible interface between them is conductive @xcite and ferromagnetic @xcite .",
    "the origin of the ferromagnetism and the conductivity is not known , it has been attributed to the polar discontinuity between the charged layer ( lao ) in contact with the neutral layer ( tio@xmath0 ) , that would produce a transfer of electrons at the interface , and also to the presence of oxygen vacancies created during film growth @xcite .",
    "the previous findings may be related to the recent intense search for ferromagnetism above room temperature in dilute magnetic semiconductors and insulators .",
    "the fabrication of these materials offers exciting possibilities for spintronic devices and the use of wide gap oxides is appealing for magnetooptical devices . in that direction",
    ", room - temperature ferromagnetism has been observed in both doped @xcite and undoped insulating oxide thin films such as tio@xmath0 , zno and hfo@xmath0 @xcite grown over other oxides or semiconductors .",
    "this magnetic order can be weak and the determination of its intrinsic character may require complementary , independent and careful techniques to be probed @xcite .",
    "many authors have attributed an important role to oxygen vacancies @xcite and other defects @xcite to produce this magnetic ordering , but the effect of the substrate or the interface has not been taken into account in the interpretations .",
    "considering the open questions in the aforementioned systems , in this work we explore the possibility of observing magnetism in an heterostructure formed by a simple oxide such a tio@xmath0 anatase and a lao substrate .",
    "experiments show that large terraces are formed on the substrate surface , and that the growth is epitaxial in the ( 001 ) direction @xcite .",
    "however , it is nor clear if the surface is mostly composed of lao planes or of alo@xmath0 planes @xcite .",
    "xps experiments show that there are ti@xmath2 and ti@xmath3 ions in these films , which may be due to the presence of oxygen vacancies @xcite or to the polar catastrophe .",
    "the magnitude of the magnetization has been found to be proportional the vacancy concentration in some experiments , for example in ref .",
    "@xcite we therefore concentrate on the effect of oxygen vacancies in the electronic structure and on the interfacial structural relaxation , as it is expected that the electric fields due to the dipole layer at the interface may lead to important changes in the positions of the atoms with respect to the bulk materials , as it happens in other interfaces @xcite . for this purpose we perform ab - initio calculations for the different interfaces present in the tio@xmath0/lao heterostructure using computational codes such as siesta @xcite or wien2k @xcite and also different unit cells .",
    "we first study separately the component systems : tio@xmath0 and lao in bulk and as free standing slabs , representing the deposited anatase film and the substrate , respectively .",
    "as the ab - initio codes allow only the study of three dimensional periodic systems , the films are represented by repeated slabs with enough free space between them . for the heterostructure",
    ", two different types of unit cell were used : trilayer slabs lao / tio@xmath0/lao and superlattices ...",

    "we use the local density approximation ( lda ) @xcite for the exchange and correlation , and small muffin tin radii to allow for lattice relaxation .",
    "the muffin tin radii used were r@xmath4 = 1.7 bohr , r@xmath5 = 1.4 bohr , r@xmath6 = 2.5 bohr , r@xmath7 = 1.7 bohr . the number of plane waves in the interstitial region is mostly restricted to rkmax=6",
    "although in many cases it was increased to rkmax=7 and no qualitative difference was observed .",
    "the effect of increasing the number of k - points was also checked . in some cases",

    "both materials are non - magnetic insulating oxides in bulk and if oxygen vacancies are present they keep their non - magnetic character although the electronic structure changes , as vacancy levels appear inside the band gap .    in order to get some insight about how these bulk properties change in the heterostructure",
    ", we study slabs of the component materials along the ( 001 ) direction . the anatase slab with 5 or 9 tio@xmath0 layers is used to model the properties of the free surface of an anatase film . a different dft calculation , using the siesta code , allows the unit cell to change its shape under relaxation , which is not the case with the wien2k code .",
    "this results in a strong deformation of the ( 001 ) surface , that goes from a square into a rectangular shape , and also makes the slab thinner .",
    "the free standing anatase film would therefore deform in that way , but as we are studying its epitaxial growth over lao we keep the in plane lattice constant fixed and the cell shape square .",
    "relaxation is only considered in the z direction , perpendicular to the slab . with this constraint",
    "we create oxygen vacancies in the surface of the slab and relax the atomic positions using the wien2k code .",
    "the vacancies seem to be crucial for the appearance of magnetism : on one hand , magnetic solutions appear if there are oxygen vacancies at the surface and on the other hand the value of the magnetic moment increases with the number of vacancies . in our calculations , one vacancy per surface ( 50% ) gives after relaxation a magnetic moment of 0.3 @xmath13 , localized at the ti atom in that surface , while two vacancies per surface give 2 @xmath13 . in fig .",
    "[ slabanatasa_cdsd ] we show the charge and spin density maps near the surface for the anatase slab with two vacancies per surface ( all the surface oxygen atoms removed ) .",
    "the system is clearly magnetic , and the magnetic moment is mostly localized in the ti superficial atom .",
    "the effect of structural relaxation is to move this ti atom closer to the remaining oxygen neighbor , which is apical and in the subsurface layer , thus making the slab thinner .",
    "in fact , this distance decreases from 1.97  in bulk tio@xmath0 to 1.89  for a surface with no oxygen vacancies and to 1.75  if there are oxygen vacancies in the surface layer as in fig .",

    "notice that only the surface ti atom has a considerable magnetic moment.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    the other building block of the heterostructures is the slab of lao . along the ( 001 ) direction",
    "this slab alternates layers of alo@xmath0 ( negatively charged ) and lao ( positively charged ) .",
    "therefore , an integer number of unit cells in the z direction would produce a large dipole and it is more convenient to use an odd number of layers . for the superlattices we consider 5 layer slabs with either lao or alo@xmath0 termination . in both cases",
    "the system becomes metallic within the lda approximation and the interesting change with respect to the bulk density of states , shown in fig .",
    "[ anatylao_dostot](b ) , is that the lao termination shifts the unoccupied surface la states substantially towards the fermi energy",
    ". this can give as a result a large hybridization with the unoccupied ti states of tio@xmath0 , but will not modify the occupied states .",
    "the system we propose to study is a tio@xmath0 ( 001 ) film with anatase structure grown epitaxially over a lao ( 001 ) substrate . for this purpose",
    "we perform calculations on the superlattices shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ unitcell ] .",
    "we have considered the 2 cases : the tio@xmath0 plane facing the alo@xmath0 or the lao termination . in both situations",
    "we assume that the oxygen atoms of the lao surface face the ti atoms of the anatase surface .",
    "the unit cell we use consists of 5 layers of each material and contains 27 or 28 atoms .",
    "the lateral lattice parameter is kept fixed at the experimental value for lao but the distance between the two slabs composing the heterostructure is obtained by minimizing the total energy .",
    "the fact that the total energy has a minimum when changing this distance verifies that there is bonding between the two materials and also gives the optimal value for that distance .",
    "this fixes the size of the superlattice unit cell along the z axis for each case , for example we notice that it changes when there are oxygen vacancies .",
    "afterwards , all the atoms are allowed to relax inside the unit cell until the force on each one is less than 2 mev /  .",
    "schematic diagrams for the unit cells of the superlattices studied .",
    "notice that there are two types of alo@xmath0/tio@xmath0 interfaces , due to the off - plane oxygen atoms in the anatase structure ( fig .",

    ", scaledwidth=60.0% ]    we find that there is a competition between the tendency of the anatase film to shrink , as in the free standing slab , and the tendency to bond to lao .",
    "in particular , if an oxygen from the anatase surface faces an al atom the bond is strong .",
    "also , there is an electrostatic effect due to the charge in each layer of lao , which is of course different for a neutral tio@xmath0 layer and for a charged layer , when oxygen vacancies are created in the anatase surface .",
    "[ anatylao_dostot](c ) and ( d ) show the density of states of the two superlattices without vacancies and after relaxation .",
    "these graphs give some insight about electron transfer or the possibility of oxygen vacancy formation , in agreement with experiments @xcite . in the case of the alo@xmath0/tio@xmath0 interface ,",
    "the states readily available near e@xmath14 are o-2@xmath8 states .",
    "this interface will then be prone to the formation of oxygen vacancies in order to allow for a compensation of the polar discontinuity present at the interface .",
    "for the lao / tio@xmath0 interface instead , the states near e@xmath14 are mainly comprised of ti 3@xmath9-states .",
    "this accessibility to a mixed valency of ti allows for a transference of electrons across the interface to overcome the electrostatic potential divergence .",
    "both interfaces are metallic without vacancies .",
    "this metallicity is not altered by the formation of oxygen vacancies or by structural relaxation",

    "both interfaces of the superlattice are identical , the magnetic moment per ti atom at the surface is considerably smaller than in the previous interface . in fig .

    "the cohesive energy of a superlattice with alo@xmath0/tio@xmath0 interfaces is also larger than that with lao / tio@xmath0 interfaces .",
    "a better approximation to the cohesive energy of a superlattice , given in table 1 , is to subtract from its total energy the energy of the relaxed slabs of tio@xmath0 and lao that compose it .",
