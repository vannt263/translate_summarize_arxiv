    "in recent years the field of public health has been benefit from the use of mathematical models to the study of spread epidemic of infectious disease .",
    "one of the first mathematical model epidemiology has been proposed by w. h. hamer in 1906 , who postulated that the development of an epidemic is related to the rate of contact between infected and susceptible individuals @xcite and currently this postulate is known as the principle of mass action @xcite .    in 1911",
    "ross has proposed one of the first models used for epidemiological study of malaria @xcite . in 1957",
    "macdonald brought a greater biological realism to the ross model , improving the accuracy and interpretation of the model parameters .",
    "the contributions of macdonald resulted in the creation of the model known as the ross - macdonald model @xcite , in which two differential equations represent the dynamics of the disease regardless of the age structure of populations and the incubation period .    in the cases of infectious diseases",
    ", situations may exist in which infected hosts once recovered again become susceptible to new infections or may become immune",
    ". however , there may be situations where the host contract the disease and do not acquire the disease elicited by the same agent again . in the first case ,",
    "these diseases are usually caused by bacterial or protozoan agents @xcite , such as malaria for example .",
    "the second case is due to viral diseases such as dengue @xcite .",
    "currently , there is great interest in studying epidemic propagation , as in the case of dengue .",
    "this disease is considered the most significant in terms of death and economic cost , since it is responsible for more deaths and infections in humans than any other arthropod - borne viruses @xcite .",
    "this scenario can be even worse , since the exact number of cases of the disease is not known .",
    "several cases go unreported because they may clinically manifest with few or no symptoms @xcite . due to",
    "the large number of people exposed , and absence of medicines able to cure infected people , the increase of dengue epidemics have motivated an intensive study of mechanical and chemical control mechanisms to used on eliminate the mosquito _ aedes aegypti_.    the mechanical control , relying on educational campaigns for the removal of containers that accumulate water , results in a significant decrease in population size of the vector when this type of control is performed on any of the seasons @xcite . moreover , the mechanical control is effective only upon the awareness of the human population to identify and eliminate outbreaks of dengue in their own homes @xcite .",
    "chemical control , based on the use of insecticide and larvicide , was tested for the reduction of vector population @xcite .",
    "more recently , in parallel , vaccination strategies have been proposed as vaccines .",
    "studies have been done to develop a vaccine , evaluate and investigate its efficacy @xcite .",
    "so , in this paper , we evaluate the set of these three strategies - mechanical control , chemical control , and vaccination - in order to assess the best way to eradicate dengue .",
    "our study is based on the dengue epidemiological model proposed by yang and ferreira @xcite .",
    "we will model the effects by the use of mechanical control mechanisms ( parameters that decrease the rate of oviposition vector , known as carrying capacity ) and chemical control ( insecticide and larvicide ) . besides the mortality rates of the vector we have also included in our study the spreading of the dengue virus in humans and suggest vaccination strategies in a human population .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ( [ mmfd ] ) introduces the ordinary differential equations of the model . in section ( [ cs ] ) ,",
    "mechanical and chemical control strategies , as well as the factors that justify the use of information based strategies in climate and rainfall modelling are described .",
    "it is also highlighted the effects of vaccination campaign and reported a measure of the efficiency of these mechanisms . in section",
    "( [ r ] ) , the model solutions obtained by numerical integration are presented and the efficiency of each strategy is evaluate .",
    "finally , in section [ c ] some conclusions are drawn .",
    "in the study of some epidemics , it is useful to separate the vector and host populations in some classes according to their stage in the infection cycle . in the case of dengue , for instance",
    ", it is useful to consider the existence of three classes for the vector and four for the host .",
    "such separation is suggested , because both the vector and the host contract the virus , go through a period of latency in which the individual has the virus but is not capable of transmitting it , became infective and , for humans , recovered from the disease @xcite .",
    "the dengue mosquito , the _ aedes aegypti _ female , can be infected with the virus when feeding infected human blood .",
    "once it have acquired the virus the mosquito , remains infected throughout its life .",
    "so it is feasible to divide the population of adult midges into susceptible , exposed and infected .",
    "classes in turn , the human population can recover from the illness , and for that reason , in addition to the existing classes for the vector , there is the class of recovered humans @xcite .",
    "the model in which the individuals are organized in these different classes from which they can entry or exit is known as _ seir_(susceptible - exposed - infectious - recovered ) @xcite . in this type of approach ,",
    "a population is represented by state variables ( subpopulation densities ) associated to the different model compartments , which envolves on time according the rules of interaction .",
    "differential equations can be used to model the rules , and give every subpopulation growth rates @xcite .",
    "our mathematical model , based on the model developed by yang and ferreira @xcite , comprises @xmath0 nonlinear first order ordinary differential equations .",
    "these equations include variables describing two classes of individuals : humans and mosquitoes .",
    "the phase of the mosquito in life cycle are represented in the system @xmath1 as follows : egg ( _ e _ ) , larva ( _ l _ ) , pupa ( _ p _ ) and adult ( _ w _ ) , the latter being composed of three subpopulations differing in its stage of infection , namely , susceptible ( @xmath2 ) , exposed ( @xmath3 ) and infected ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the parameters of the model are related to biotic and abiotic factors .",
    "they represent averages of values that takes into account all stages of vector in development , effective rates of natural mortality , and contact rates between the stages of infection of the human population and the mosquitoes .",
    "the transition rates between the phases of egg , larva , pupa and adult are represented by the parameters @xmath5 , ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "in addition , the system @xmath1 contains other rates : oviposition ( @xmath7 ) , mortality of eggs , larvae , pupae and adult midges @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) ; which are functions of temperature , humidity , and rain precipitation .",
    "thus these rates reflect abiotic factors .",

    "hence , the effects of temperature on the life cycle of insects read be modeled to understand the population dynamics of dengue vectors and can be exploited to develop appropriate vector control strategies .    in brazil ,",
    "the fall season begins in march , winter in june , the spring starts in september , and the summer in december .",

    "there population size of the dengue mosquito increases considerably rainy season due to the increase in the number of containers with standing water , ideal places for mosquito oviposition @xcite .",

    "the environmental support capacity is given by @xmath12 for the population of eggs , and is interpreted as the physical space available for mosquitoes oviposition .",

    "the parameter values used by the table ( @xmath10 ) were adopted in order to describe coexistence between populations of humans and mosquitoes ( aquatic and adult ) .",

    ", there was an increase in the number of disease case when compared to simulations in which there were no mechanical control .",
    "however , in the next interval ( between @xmath105 and @xmath106 days ) this number was smaller .",
    "this variation in the number of cases is due to the interference of mechanical control .",
    "reflexes are observed in the period after the intervention , since this type of control eliminates the aquatic stages of the mosquito .        when the control is performed only in one of the annual periods , an increase in the number of humans infected in period , even with a reduction in the number of infected vectors as shown in figure @xmath103 .",
    "we can realize greater efficiencies through the use of mechanical control throughout the year .",
    "however , the _ aedes aegypti _ mosquito is not eradicated only using the mechanical control and , consequently , the virus remains in the human population .",

    "this may indicate that the density of infected mosquitoes does not interfere with the virus permanence into the system , but simply there is a critical population size that guarantees virus support .",
    "accordingly , in countries in an endemic state , most of their districts presented a vector index below the value required for the risk of dengue fever epidemics @xcite .",

    "in addition , according to the technical note @xmath114 @xcite , it is important to consider that there are no insecticides suitable for use in public health , since all these products are used specifically for agriculture .      since the use of insecticide and larvicidal separately was inefficient to eliminate the population of dengue adult vectors , we considered a scenario in which the two chemicals were applied simultaneously with the mechanical control throughout the year .",

    "figure ( @xmath141 ) shows the result of simulations in which @xmath0 individuals infected with the dengue virus appear at two different periods of the year .",
    "if these infected individuals come when chemical control is applied in the favorable period ( continuous line ) , dengue does not reappear and the system remains free of the disease . on the contrary , if they are introduced in the unfavorable period , when there was no chemical control ( dashed line ) , we have periodic outbreaks of the disease are observed .",
    "this suggests that a control campaign performed only in a period of the year may not be effective in eliminating dengue totally , since the virus can reappear through the emergence of infected people .",
    "infected humans appear in a system free of viruses .",
    "the analyses were made in the favorable and unfavorable periods.,width=321 ]    with the rate @xmath142 the human population does not grow exponentially , probably because the elimination of infected persons through the use of chemical control becomes possible . but even with the complete elimination of the population of infected vectors , it has not been possible to eliminate all the susceptible mosquito population in the system as shown in figure ( @xmath141 ) .",
    "the dengue fever may reappear at any time , unless there is a vaccine to protect the population against the virus .      in this simulation the population does not exhibit a high growth rate and the vaccination campaign will be represented by the withdrawal of a fixed number of susceptible individuals ( @xmath143 ) by adding them into the recovered population .",
    "thus , the vaccination rate is no longer proportional to the number of susceptible individuals , and is described by equations ( @xmath144 ) and ( @xmath145 ) . in this case , a deemed efficiency @xmath146 for the vaccine is considered since it is the immunization threshold acceptable by health agencies .",
    "@xmath147 @xmath148    figure ( @xmath149 ) shows how the system behaves under immunization of @xmath150 people per day for @xmath24 month , with different times of duration of the campaign .",
    "it can be observed that , if the campaign remains for only @xmath151 consecutive years , dengue virus re - emerge in populations of mosquitoes and humans and the epidemic reappears .",
    "however , if the duration of the campaign is @xmath0 years , it is possible to eradicate the dengue virus from the human population for at least @xmath152 years , in a total simulations time fixed at @xmath95 years . to find out the time required for the permanent eradication of the virus from the system ,",
    "more simulations considering longer simulation times , as well as the possibility of the emergence of other virus serotypes must be carried out .",
    "individuals per day with different periods of duration.,width=321 ]    several studies show that a vaccine that protects the population from the dengue virus is about to be created .",
    "an attenuated tetravalent vaccine virus has been tested in order to characterize the interactions between the different serotypes of dengue virus , concluding that it is possible to create an effective vaccine against all four serotypes of the dengue virus @xcite .",
    "however , an important point to be considered is whether live , attenuated virus vaccines do not offer risks to human health , since it is not clear that the presence of four types of strains into a single vaccine might increase the risk of developing severe forms of the disease @xcite .",
    "mathematical models are quite useful for observing the dynamics of infectious diseases such as the dengue fever . the creation of mathematical models that simulate the interaction between host - vector generates momentum in the system . through the compartmental model proposed by yang and ferreira was used , it was possible to introduce small changes in order to test new control strategies .",
    "testing the mechanical and chemical control verified the vaccination strategies for the human population .",
    "the mechanical and chemical control were effective in reducing the population of aedes aegypti but assured that the disease has been eliminated from the system .",
    "the control that used only the larvicidal had a very low contribution in this reduction , probably because the time interval between the implementation and its impact on the population of adults is very high , making this control to be less appropriate in controlling an epidemic of dengue fever .",
    "the mechanical control is much more efficient , which indicates that awareness campaigns are more useful than the use of controls through insecticide and larvicidal .",
    "when considering a human population birth rate equal to @xmath153 , it was possible to simulate an exponential growth dynamics of this population .",
    "however , this consideration does not affect the effectiveness of mechanical control . in this case",
    "the application of mechanical control must be constant throughout the year . once this control is active only in time after his application",
    ", it generates an increase in the number of cases in the other two periods , as there is no control being carried out .    with respect to the use of chemical control",
    ", there was an interference mosquito population in a yield of @xmath108 for the insecticide and larvicide only @xmath111 .",
    "when the chemical and mechanical control were used together , there was an efficiency of @xmath117 . in the latter case , even with greater efficiency",
    ", the use of these controls did not influence the dynamics of dengue in the human population , who remained infected .",
    "importantly , the chemicals used in the simulations is fictitious and quite specific .",
    "simulations with insecticide and larvicide with different duration should be conducted so that we can guarantee these results .",
    "when the use of both controls was compared to situation where no control was accomplished , it resulted in an efficiency of @xmath116 , compared to the situation where only the mechanical control was carried out in which the efficiency value fell to @xmath117 , thus showing that the mechanical control is more efficient in the elimination of mosquito population than the chemical control even when applied throughout the year .    when the birth rate was changed to @xmath154__day _ _ , it was no longer possible to observe an exponential growth for the human population . in this case",
    "the efficiency of mechanical control remained at @xmath133 . in the same way for the previous simulations",
    ", there was no significant reflection on human population infected .",
    "the chemical control can eliminate the infected population but the outbreaks do not end with a susceptible population . with @xmath0 individuals in the system infected with the dengue virus in the period in which the control is not being applied in the unfavorable time , periodic outbreaks of the disease occur .",
    "the only way to contain the dengue epidemic , regardless of the form of population growth , is to create a vaccine to immunize the population against the virus .",
    "the population grew exponentially during the immunization vaccination campaign for a fraction proportional to a vaccination rate of individuals , @xmath85 .",
    "for this campaign to become really effective it is necessary to have a duration of three months and an efficiency rate of at least @xmath133 .",
    "it was possible to note the existence of annual cycles and a strong seasonality of epidemic cycles @xcite .",
    "a major concern for the safety of live attenuated virus vaccines is the genetic stability .",
    "the use of molecular tools is required to ensure quality , safety and authenticity of genetic vaccine @xcite .",
    "already when the exponential growth is removed , the campaign is based on daily immunization @xmath143 , of people , with an efficiency of @xmath133 . in this case",
    "it is necessary to maintain the campaign for at least @xmath0 years to ensure at least @xmath152 years of a system free of the disease .",
    "variable @xmath120 was introduced representing the portion of infected who die from complications related to dengue fever .",
    "the addition of this new factor caused the outbreaks of the disease might arise later , but as the simulation time is fixed at @xmath95 years this variable can have a major stake , because it may delay the outbreak so that it will not reappear during the time examined .",
    "however , field surveys are still necessary in order to better understand the mechanisms responsible for generating these dynamics .",
    "in addition , more simulations must be carried out in order to consider a longer time of observation , while factoring in the possibility of the emergence of other serotypes of the disease and biological ways of eliminating the vector .",
    "further studies are needed to understand the mechanisms responsible for generating the dynamics of dengue in order to learn how to fight it .",
    "the need for a vaccine is essential for the elimination of dengue viruses in human populations , thus it is expected that studies about immunization are satisfactory and achieve a positive result as soon as possible .",
