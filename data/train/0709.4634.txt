    "<S> different approaches to take into account nonzero lepton mass in the rein - sehgal model are compared . </S>",
    "<S> modification of the axial current due to pion pole term are included and it is shown that they lead to large reduction of antineutrino cross section and a change of the shape of @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of results of neutrino experiments is based on monte carlo generators of events . because precise experimental data on inclusive and exclusive cross sections is still missing the generators rely on approximate models . in the 1 gev neutrino energy region </S>",
    "<S> there is an important contribution from charged current ( cc ) and neutral current ( nc ) single pion production ( spp ) channels . in most monte carlo ( mc ) codes </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the dynamics responsible for spp is described in the framework of the rein - sehgal ( rs ) model @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the rs model is an old construction based on the relativistic quark resonance fkr model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that in the case of electro - production its predictions are far away from the new precise experimental data but nevertheless the model is useful in describing neutrino interactions . </S>",
    "<S> there are several reasons why it is so . </S>",
    "<S> the model is suitable for mc applications as for spp channels it provides a description of all degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> the original rs paper provides a clear algorithm how to implement the model . </S>",
    "<S> another advantage of the rs model is that it covers a large region in @xmath1 ( @xmath2  gev ) in the kinematically allowed space . </S>",
    "<S> but the most important is that the predictions of the model agree with the existing data . </S>",
    "<S> the predictions for the integrated cross sections can be fine tuned to the data by modifying the value of the free parameter , an axial mass . </S>",
    "<S> an additional fine tuning can be done with a non - resonant background which must be added in some spp channels . </S>",
    "<S> there are other more sophisticated and better founded approaches to describe spp in the @xmath3 resonance region like e.g. lee - sato model @xcite but the rs model is still used and its performance must be regarded as an important topic of investigation .    the original rs approach adopts the assumption that leptonic mass @xmath4 . with this assumption all the computations in the model become easier . </S>",
    "<S> an approximate way to introduce @xmath5 corrections is to consider them in the kinematics only . </S>",
    "<S> the procedure is to use the formula for @xmath6 as in the original rs model but to perform integration over the restricted kinematical region in the @xmath7 plane , the same as in the @xmath5 case . </S>",
    "<S> this is the common way in which @xmath5 effects are included in mc codes .    in recent years </S>",
    "<S> there is a growing number of indications that predictions of mc generators overestimate the cross section in the low @xmath8 region . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore important to check exactly the modifications introduced to the rs model by @xmath5 effects and it is the subject of this paper . </S>",
    "<S> the modifications we consider are of two kinds . </S>",
    "<S> first we use the same hadronic current as in the rs model . </S>",
    "<S> the inclusion of @xmath5 effects requires extra computation of hadronic weak current matrix elements . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations are based on the observation that the operational structure of the components of the hadronic current @xmath9 and @xmath10 are identical . in the original rs paper </S>",
    "<S> the matrix elements of linear combination @xmath11 are calculated . </S>",
    "<S> we use these results and by appropriate substitutions obtain matrix elements of @xmath9 and @xmath10 separately .     </S>",
    "<S> ( left figure ) and @xmath12 ( right figure ) due to @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> three computations are compared : ( i ) kinematical approximation ( dotted line ) ( ii ) exact computation without pion pole contribution ( dashed line ) ( iii ) exact computations with pion pole contribution included ( solid line ) . </S>",
    "<S> the cut on the invariant hadronic mass @xmath13  gev is imposed . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_ratio_total_masses],width=604,height=188 ]    the second modification is more subtle and requires an inclusion of a new term in the axial current based on the pcac arguments . </S>",
    "<S> the procedure how to modify the axial current was described in @xcite :    @xmath14    the pion pole term does not contribute when the lepton mass is vanishing because the leptonic tensor @xmath15 satisfies @xmath16 . in the coordinate system in which @xmath17 the pcac modifies only @xmath9 and @xmath10 components of the axial hadronic current and its inclusion can be again realized by substitutions in the original rs formulas . </S>",
    "<S> some technical details about our calculations are contained in appendix  [ appendix_cross_section ] .     but for reaction @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_ratio_q2_anty],width=604,height=188 ]    few years ago naumov s group extended the rs model to take into account the first part of @xmath5 effects @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they expressed cross section by matrix elements of three currents : @xmath19 ( as in the rs model ) and new component @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> it can be show that this part their calculations are equivalent to ours . </S>",
    "<S> however , there is an important difference : in @xcite the pion pole contribution was not considered and we will see in the discussion that it is quite relevant .    in fig .  [ fig_ratio_total_masses ] </S>",
    "<S> we show the plots with relative modification of the cross section for @xmath21 and @xmath22 caused by @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the functions we define are :    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is calculated in three different model :    * in _ kinematical approximation _ i.e. including @xmath5 effects only in kinematics , as described above ; * in exact computation but without pion pole contribution ; * in the complete computations with pion pole contribution included .    in the case of neutrino - nucleon scattering </S>",
    "<S> all three approaches give rise to comparable results . at @xmath25  </S>",
    "<S> gev the differences between predictions for the total cross section is of order 5 % .    in the case of antineutrino - nucleon scattering the approaches ( i ) and ( ii ) </S>",
    "<S> give similar results while the exact computations ( iii ) with pion pole contribution introduce a significant reduction of the total cross section .    </S>",
    "<S> we verified that the same is true also for other neutrino and antineutrino induced spp channels .    in the fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_ratio_q2 ] we investigate @xmath0 ( left panel ) and its shape ( right panel ) for reaction @xmath26 at neutrino energy @xmath27  gev . approaches ( i ) and ( ii ) give similar results . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution from pion pole visibly reduces the differential cross section for low @xmath8 but its shape remains virtually unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> it is an important observation because in the experimental analysis the shape of @xmath0 is of major interests .    </S>",
    "<S> the situation becomes different in the case of antineutrino - nucleon scattering . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_ratio_q2_anty ] we plot the same curves as in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_ratio_q2 ] but this time the reaction is @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> the peak of the differential cross section in the approach ( iii ) is @xmath28% lower in the models ( i ) and ( ii ) . </S>",
    "<S> what is more important also the shape of the differential cross section is changed and the peak is reduced by @xmath29% .    </S>",
    "<S> the difference between neutrino and antineutrino scattering can be understood when the differential cross sections is expressed in terms of @xmath30 , @xmath31 structure functions ( see appendix [ appendix_sf ] ) . only @xmath32 and @xmath33 become modified by the pion pole terms but the contribution from the @xmath32 is negligible . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution from @xmath33 is negative ( pion pole terms make it smaller ) and its absolute values decreases quickly with @xmath8 ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_contributions_w ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it reduces the differential cross section in low @xmath8 . in the case of antineutrino scattering </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath34 terms contributes with the negative sign . </S>",
    "<S> the antineutrino cross section is smaller and the @xmath33 induced reduction is more important .    </S>",
    "<S> there is another approximate way to include @xmath5 effects : to apply exact expressions for @xmath35 as defined in the original rs model and to use albright - jarlskog relations ( a - j ) @xcite for @xmath32 and @xmath33 : @xmath36     in the differential cross section @xmath37 for reaction @xmath38 at neutrino energies 1 , 2 and 3  gev . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_contributions_w],width=680 ]    we checked numerically that @xmath39 holds with an accuracy of 20% for @xmath40  gev@xmath41 , @xmath42 for @xmath43  gev@xmath41 and 1% for @xmath44  gev@xmath41 . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig_ratio_total_rs_vs_ff ] we present the similar plots as in fig .  [ fig_ratio_total_masses ] . </S>",
    "<S> we see that for neutrino scattering the approximation based on the a - j relation is a good one but in antineutrino case the total cross section is underestimated . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_diff_q2_rs_vs_ff ] we see that at @xmath48  mev the approximation we discuss reconstructs well the @xmath0 in the case of neutrino reaction . for antineutrino scattering </S>",

    "<S> the conclusions of our investigation is that ( in the case of antineutrino reactions ) it is improper to use rs model without pion pole terms . </S>",
