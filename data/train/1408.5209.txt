    "_ let us now revisit the plaquette geometry and consider the fns evolution of the quantum cyclotron orbits . since the initial state @xmath41 is not an eigenstate of @xmath95 , the density matrix @xmath97 in the @xmath71-frequency limit gets dressed .",
    "@xmath98    it follows that @xmath90 represents a mixed state at any @xmath35 , such that @xmath99 . in this sense ,",
    "the fns expectation value is somewhat reminiscent of finite - temperature , although we could not establish a general relation between the two .",
    "figure  [ fig : fns_orbits ] , panels ( a)-(c ) , compares the fns evolution ( red ) to the exact evolution ( grey dotted line ) , and the evolution expected from the hh model ( yellow line ) . for the fns evolution curve , we used the exact dressed observable and density matrix , calculated to all orders in the inverse frequency , and the evolution is performed w.r.t .  the floquet hamiltonian @xmath6 . due to",
    "the change of the initial condition from a pure state to a mixed state , the orbit no longer starts from the expected point @xmath100 .",
    "the shrinking in the size of the orbit is due to the non - resonant drive , c.f .",
    "[ sec : fs ] .",
    "this , together with the delocalisation of the local number operator at finite frequencies , leads to a further deviation of the orbit from the time - averaged one .",
    "nevertheless , we can conclude that when measuring the local density and combinations thereof , the fns evolution is equally good as the fs evolution , especially in the high - frequency limit .",
    "we expect this to hold for any observable which commutes with @xmath95 .    _ chiral currents .",
    "_ on the other hand , the situation is very different for the fns evolution of the chiral currents .",
    "it follows that , in this case , the infinite - frequency fns - current coincides precisely with the hh - current :    @xmath101    hence , we expect that the fns expectation of the lab - frame current correctly reproduces the @xmath71-frequency behaviour of the hh - current .    in order to explore this in greater detail ,",
    "let us assume that the phase of the driving can be fixed , so that there is no need to average over the initial time @xmath89 .",
    "hence , we need not dress the density matrix , and the initial state remains a pure state . at the same time , we assume that we do not have a perfect control over the final time @xmath87 .",
    "therefore , we still have to dress the current operator .",
    "we refer to this type of non - stroboscopic evolution as fns@xmath102 .    figure  [ fig : fns_currents ] , panels ( a)-(c ) , compare the fns@xmath102 evolution of the current operator at different driving frequencies .",

    "this is the same curve as in fig .",
    "[ fig : fs_currents ] , panels ( a)-(c ) .",
    "an ideal simulation of the hh model would reproduce this curve .",

    "the fns - current here is calculated numerically including all inverse - frequency corrections .",
    "observe that , contrary to the fs evolution , this curve ( grey ) approaches the curve expected from the hh model ( yellow ) in the limit @xmath22 .",

    ", we also show the blue dash - dotted curve from fig .",
    "[ fig : fs_currents ] which shows the corresponding exact evolution .",
    "obviously , it follows that the fns dynamics captures all the main characteristics of the slow evolution w.r.t .",
    "it simply averages out the fast oscillations due to the kick operator @xmath7 .",
    "hence , in models where the floquet hamiltonian has prescribed engineered properties  @xcite , it is the fns evolution that reveals the physics behind @xmath6 , and not the fs one .",
    "we discuss two different types of expectation values in periodically driven systems : the fs and fns evolution .",
    "the fns expectation value is a statistical one , and the associated density matrix depends mostly on the properties of the initial state ( localized vs.  delocalized ) .",
    "we found that , in general , only the fns evolution gives access to local observables which correspond to the floquet hamiltonian . in this context , we showed that stroboscopic evolution will fail to reproduce the dynamics of the harper - hofstadter current at any frequency , since it merely evolves the lab - frame current , which is not conserved w.r.t .",
    "the evolution due to @xmath6 , with the floquet hamiltonian .",
    "stroboscopic measurements can reveal the physics of the floquet hamiltonian , but only for observables , invariant under the driving hamiltonian @xmath95 . for all other types of observables",
    ", one needs to resort to fns evolution .",
    "we verified these predictions by examining the quantum cyclotron orbits on a @xmath0 plaquette , as well as the evolution of the local current on a @xmath1 ladder in the non - interacting system with open boundary conditions .",
    "moreover , in the high - frequency limit , the stroboscopic and the floquet expectations coincide if , and only if , the initial state is an eigenstate of , _ and _ the observable commutes with the operator to which the periodic driving couples .",
