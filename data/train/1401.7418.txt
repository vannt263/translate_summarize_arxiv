    "supernova remnants ( snrs ) in the galaxy are believed to be most likely accelerators of cosmic - rays ( crs ) below  knee , in an energy range less than @xmath510@xmath6 ev .",
    "the highest energy @xmath1-rays in the galaxy are emitted from three young and very - high - energy ( vhe ; @xmath7 @xmath8 100 gev ) @xmath1-ray snrs , rx j1713.7@xmath23946 @xcite , rx j0852.0@xmath24622 @xcite , and hess j1731@xmath2347 @xcite . in these snrs , it is suggested that cr protons or electrons are accelerated efficiently up to 10800 tev or 140 tev , respectively ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "all the three show pure synchrotron x - rays with no thermal features , and acceleration of tev cr electrons is well established .",
    "the origin of the @xmath1-rays in these snrs , either hadronic or leptonic , has been under debate ; the gev @xmath1-ray observations show hard @xmath1-ray spectrum similar to that of the leptonic @xmath1-rays @xcite , whereas a recent comparative study between @xmath1-rays and the interstellar protons is consistent with the hadronic origin of @xmath1-rays @xcite .",
    "it is notable that the numerical simulations on the shock - cloud interaction @xcite lend support for the hadronic @xmath1-rays , since the low energy cr protons producing the gev @xmath1-rays can not penetrate into the densest part of the cloud cores , leading to the hard spectrum just presented by @xcite .",
    "a similar conclusion is drawn by @xcite and @xcite . even though the leptonic scenarios are still debated from a different perspective ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .    the young snr rx j1713.7@xmath23946 ( also known as g347.3@xmath20.5 ) is one of the best targets for testing the action of the cr electrons , because the snr emits strong synchrotron x - rays and vhe @xmath1-rays @xcite .",

    "@xmath11 observations revealed filamentary structures of x - rays and short time variability ( @xmath31 yr ) of one of them @xcite , which is interpreted as due to rapid particle acceleration of cr electrons and cooling in @xmath31 yr scale with mg magnetic field .",
    "if this is correct , the cr electrons should be accelerated efficiently in the  bohm diffusion regime @xcite . additionally , when the cosmic - rays are accelerated , the magnetic fields amplified by cosmic - ray streaming instability @xcite .",
    "moreover , different processes of amplifying magnetic fields may be working in during shock - cloud interaction ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the amplified magnetic field may intensify the non - thermal x - rays , whereas the synchrotron loss due to the amplified field may decrease the number of cr electrons via synchrotron loss ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in order to test such actions , we need a detailed comparison between the electron spectrum and the interstellar matte .",

    "this comparison shows that the ism distribution has generally good correspondence with the x - ray absorbing column density .",

    "the blue - shifted ism in the west shows a poor correlation with the x - ray absorbing column density of lcc@xmath30.25 , while the red - shifted ism in the west has a higher correlation of lcc@xmath30.39 than the blue - shifted ism ( see also table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "this indicates that the red - shifted ism is located on the far - side of the snr , and it is in the opposite sense to what is expected in an expanding motion of the shell - like ism .",
    "the relative position of the ism is explicable if the pre - existent cloud motion is dominant for the dense co gas instead of expansion , as already suggested to explain the velocity distribution of the hi self - absorption @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed by magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) numerical simulations that the x - ray intensity is closely correlated with the ism by the enhanced magnetic field around dense clumps due to turbulence in the shock - cloud interaction .",
    "the interaction creates correlation between the ism and x - rays at a pc scale via the magnetic field .",
    "observations by @xcite showed that pc - scale correlation is seen between the x - ray intensity and the clump mass interacting with the snr blast waves , as well as anti - correlation between them in a sub - pc scale due to exclusion of the cr electrons in the dense clumps .",
    "the distributions of the x - ray intensity in figure [ fig5]a at grid sizes of 28 arcmin ( 0.62.4 pc ) show their interrelation at a pc scale ; we see trend that the x - rays are enhanced in the west where the ism is rich , and that the x - rays are depressed in the east where the ism is poor .",
    "this is consistent with what is expected in the shock - cloud interaction scheme .",
    "the higher dispersion in figure [ fig6]a may be in part ascribed to anti - correlation at a sub - pc scale , consistent with the suggestion by @xcite .",
    "based on the present results on the photon index ( figure [ fig3]b ) , we discuss the efficient cosmic - ray acceleration in rx j1713.7@xmath23946 . as shown by the previous works @xcite , the photon index in the 110kev range reflects rolloff energy @xmath82 of the synchrotron x - rays .",
    "the small ( large ) photon index corresponds to large ( small ) rolloff energy . according to the standard dsa scheme , the rolloff energy of synchrotron photons @xmath82 is given as follows when the synchrotron cooling is effective @xcite , @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the shock speed and @xmath85 ( @xmath81 ) a gyro - factor , the degree of magnetic field fluctuations .",
    "in particular the limit of @xmath86 = 1 is called as bohm limit corresponding to highly turbulent conditions and , accordingly , the rolloff energy is likely determined by the shock speed and turbulence .",
    "the present results suggest that in the western half of the snr , where the ism is rich , the shock - cloud interaction is effective and that turbulence is enhanced around dense ism clumps . on the other hand , in the eastern half of the snr where the ism is poor the dsa alone is mainly working without shock - cloud interaction .",
    "@xcite presented that the innermost cavity of 34 pc radius is surrounded by the ism shell consisting of the dense clumps and the inter - clump gas .",
    "the dense clumps have density of 10@xmath4 to 10@xmath71 @xmath70 @xcite and are mainly distributed in the western half toward the galactic plane .",
    "the inter - clump gas has density @xmath87 @xmath70 , as given by the upper limit from no thermal x - rays @xcite , and we shall adopt density of the inter - clump gas to be 1 @xmath70 for discussion .",
    "we assume that density in the cavity is @xmath30.25 @xmath70 , the same with that estimated toward gum nebula where the gas is swept up by the strong stellar winds from @xmath88 pup @xcite . in this scheme",
    ", dsa is efficiently taking place in the cavity and the accelerated crs are injected into the ism shell .    in the western half of the snr outside the center ( figure [ fig3]d ) , where the shock - cloud interaction is working ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the magnetic field may be amplified up to @xmath31 mg as indicated by the short time variation of @xmath31 yr in the synchrotron x - rays by @xmath11 , where the bohm limit ( @xmath86 = 1 ) is a good approximation @xcite . on the other hand , in the eastern half the shock speed is not much decelerated in the lower density . because the shock speed @xmath84 is proportional to 1/@xmath89 and decreases in the dense ism , where @xmath90 is the average number density of the ism .",
    "the average ism density in the eastern half is about 1/4 of that in the western half from the co / hi observations and the shock speed @xmath84 becomes larger by a factor of 2 .",
    "then , @xmath86 in the southeast becomes larger by a factor of 4 , but the term ( the shock speed @xmath84)@xmath4 is more effective .",
    "the trend in the photon index is thus largely explained in the dsa scheme by considering the effect of the ism gas , and in the both regions the rolloff energy becomes larger and the photon index smaller as @xmath53 .    in figure [ fig5]b , the center of the snr ( figure [ fig3]b ) having the large photon index @xmath91",
    "is shown by orange color .",
    "we suggest that the electrons there have lower rolloff energy due to synchrotron cooling over the last 1000 yrs ; for magnetic field of 10 @xmath92 g the cr electron cooling time at 10 kev is small as @xmath3500 yrs , whereas that at 1 kev is large as @xmath31500 yrs , leading to low rolloff energy in the central 34 pc .",
    "we also note that such spectral softening can be ascribed to the energy loss due to adiabatic expansion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "one would expect that the photon index becomes even larger toward the denser regions , if only @xmath84 determines the photon index .",
    "interestingly , the photon index becomes small toward the clump c and the region between the two dense clumps , d and l in figure [ fig5]b .",
    "it is also notable that the x - rays are enhanced toward these regions having small photon indexes . in the shock - cloud interaction scheme , the magnetic field",
    "is amplified in the interacting region , leading to higher synchrotron loss and smaller rolloff energy .",
    "this can lead to lower x - ray intensity and lower rolloff energy toward the dense clumps , while obviously we need a more elaborate work to quantitatively affirm this .",
    "it remains to be explored if the dsa scheme can accommodate the high x - ray intensity , the high ism density , and the small photon index consistently .",
    "also we here suggest that some additional acceleration mechanism may possibly be working to accelerate cr particles in the west where the ism is rich .",
    "such mechanisms possibly include the 2nd order fermi acceleration @xcite , magnetic reconnection in the turbulent medium @xcite , reverse shock acceleration ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , non - liner effect of dsa ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and so on .",
    "to summarize , we suggest that the ism and its distribution have a significant impact on the scheme of the particle acceleration via the shock - cloud interaction .",
    "this suggests the tight relationship between the snr and the ism .",
    "the present study explored the cr electron behavior into significant details not achieved in the previous works , and presented that the ism density affects significantly the cr electron rolloff energy . in particular , dense molecular clumps excites turbulent in the shock waves , amplifying the magnetic field .",
    "the cr electron rolloff energy is increased in spite of such amplified field , and we suggest that additional electron acceleration may be taking place in such turbulent regimes around the dense clumps .    in near future , cherenkov telescope array ( cta ) will provide information on the spectral distribution of @xmath1-rays over the snr at 1 arcmin resolution and will allow us to investigate the spectra and acceleration of both the cr protons and electrons .",
    "in addition , the soft x - ray spectrometer ( sxs ) of astro - h will probe yet undetected thermal x - rays by sensitive high - energy resolution spectroscopy in rx j1713.7@xmath23946 . we can then probe the fraction of the energy of the snr blast waves used for cosmic - ray acceleration . and",
    "the hard x - ray imager ( hxi ) of astro - h will resolve photon index distribution at 10 kev or higher , possibly allowing us to constrain electron energy spectrum models by comparing that below 10 kev ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these future instruments will enable more accurate measurements of the efficient cosmic - ray acceleration .",
    "we summarize the present work as follows .    1 .",
    "we have estimated the spatial distribution of absorbing column density , photon index , and absorption - corrected flux ( 310 kev ) comparable to the scale of the ism distribution , a few arcmin , by using @xmath0 archival data with low background .",
    "2 .   the x - ray flux shows enhancement toward the dense ism .",
    "this is consistent with the shock - cloud interaction model by @xcite that x - rays become bright around the dense cloud cores due to turbulence amplification of magnetic field .",
    "3 .   photon index shows a large variation within the snr from @xmath13 = 2.12.9 .",
    "the photon index shows smallest values around the dense regions of cloud cores as well as toward diffuse regions with no molecular gas .",
    "this trend can be described as a rolloff energy variation of cr electrons @xcite .",
    "we present possible parameters to explain the variation of the rolloff energy under the dsa scheme .",
    "the enhanced intensity and harder spectra of the x - rays toward the dense clumps may require additional electron acceleration toward the dense clumps possibly via magnetic reconnection or other mechanism incorporating magnetic turbulence .",
    "4 .   the absorbing column density shows a good correlation with the visual extinction .",
    "we found that the southeast - rim identified by hi self - absorption , which shows enhanced vhe @xmath1-rays has a clear counterpart in the x - ray absorption too , lending new support to the hi self - absorption interpretation .",
