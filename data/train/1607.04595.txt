    "@xmath3 represents the set of coordinates and momenta of that system .",
    "`` _ canonical _ '' means simplest or prototypical .",
    "the heat reservoir coupled to the small system and responsible for the canonical distribution of energies is best pictured as an ideal - gas thermometer characterized by an unchanging kinetic temperature @xmath0 .",
    "the reservoir gas consists of many small - mass classical particles engaged in a chaotic and ergodic state of thermal and mechanical equilibrium with negligible fluctuations in its temperature and pressure .",
    "equilibrium within this thermometric reservoir is maintained by collisions as is described by boltzmann s equation .",
    "his `` h theorem '' establishes the maxwell - boltzmann velocity distribution found in the gas .",
    "see steve brush s 1964 translation of boltzmann s 1896 text _ vorlesungen ber gastheorie_.    prior to fast computers texts in statistical mechanics were relatively formal with very few figures and only a handful of numerical results . in its more than 700 pages tolman",
    "s 1938 tome _ the principles of statistical mechanics _ includes only two figures . [ the more memorable one , a disk colliding with a triangle , appears on the cover of the dover reprint volume . ] today the results - oriented graphics situation is entirely different as a glance inside any recent issue of _ science _ confirms .",
    "in 1984 , with the advent of fast computers and packaged computer graphics software already past , shuichi nos set himself the task of generalizing molecular dynamics to mimic gibbs canonical distribution@xcite . in the end",
    "his approach was revolutionary .",
    "it led to a new form of heat reservoir described by a single degree of freedom with a logarithmic potential , rather than the infinitely - many oscillators or gas particles discussed in textbooks .",
    "although the theory underlying nos s approach was cumbersome hoover soon pointed out a useful simplification@xcite : liouville s flow equation in the phase space provides a direct proof that the `` nos - hoover '' motion equations are consistent with gibbs canonical distribution . here",
    "are the motion equations for the simplest interesting system , a single one - dimensional harmonic oscillator : @xmath4/\\tau^2 \\ .\\ ] ] the `` friction coefficient '' @xmath5 stabilizes the kinetic energy @xmath6 through integral feedback , extracting or inserting energy as needed to insure a time - averaged value of precisely @xmath7 .",
    "the parameter @xmath8 is a relaxation time governing the rate of the thermostat s response to thermal fluctuations .",
    "in what follows we will set all the parameters and constants @xmath9 equal to unity , purely for convenience .",
    "then the nos - hoover equations have the form : @xmath10 \\ .\\ ] ]    liouville s phase - space flow equation , likewise written here for a single degree of freedom , is just the usual continuity equation for the three - dimensional flow of a probability density in the ( @xmath11 ) phase space : @xmath12 this approach leads directly to the simple [ nh ] dynamics described above .",
    "it is easy to verify that gibbs canonical distribution needs only to be multiplied by a gaussian distribution in @xmath5 in order to satisfy liouville s equation . @xmath13",
    "hoover emphasized that the simplest thermostated system , a harmonic oscillator , does _ not _ fill out the entire gibbs distribution in @xmath14 space .",
    "it is not `` ergodic '' and fails to reach all of the oscillator phase space .",
    "in fact , with _ all _ of the parameters ( mass , force constant , boltzmann s constant , temperature , and relaxation time @xmath8 ) set equal to unity only six percent of the gaussian distribution is involved in the chaotic sea@xcite .",
    "see * figure 1 * for a cross section of the nos - hoover sea in the @xmath15 plane .",
    "the complexity in the figure , where the `` holes '' correspond to two - dimensional tori in the three - dimensional @xmath14 phase space , is due to the close relationship of the nos - hoover thermostated equations to conventional chaotic hamiltonian mechanics with its infinitely - many elliptic and hyperbolic points .",
    "new varieties of thermostats , some of them hamiltonian and some not , appeared over the ensuing 30-year period following nos s work@xcite . this list is by no means complete . though important , simplicity is not the sole motivation for abandoning purely - hamiltonian thermostats .",
    "relatively recently we pointed out that hamiltonian thermostats are incapable of generating or absorbing heat flow@xcite .",
    "the close connection between changing phase volume and entropy production guarantees that hamiltonian mechanics is fundamentally inconsistent with irreversible flows .",
    "at equilibrium braka , kowalik , and wojciechowski@xcite followed bulgac and kusnezov@xcite in emphasizing that _ cubic _ frictional forces , @xmath16 , which also follow from a novel hamiltonian , promote a much better coverage of phase space , as shown in * figure 2 * .",
    "the many small holes in the @xmath15 cross section show that this approach also lacks ergodicity .",
    "attempts to improve upon this situation led to a large literature with the most useful contributions applying thermostating ideas with two or more thermostat variables@xcite .",
    "an example , applied to the harmonic oscillator , was tested by hoover and holian@xcite and found to provide all of gibbs distribution : @xmath17}\\ ] ] the two thermostat variables @xmath18 together guarantee that both the second and the fourth moments of the velocity distribution have their maxwell - boltzmann values [ 1 and 3 ] . notice that two - dimensional cross sections like those in the figures are no longer useful diagnostics for ergodicity once the phase - space dimensionality exceeds three .      in 2014",
    "patra and bhattacharya@xcite suggested thermostating both the coordinates and the momenta : @xmath19 } \\ .\\ ] ] an approach already tried by sergi and ezra in 2001@xcite .    a slight variation of the sergi - ezra - patra - bhattacharya thermostat takes into account bulgac and kusnezov s observation that cubic terms favor ergodicity : @xmath20 } \\ .\\ ] ] these last two - thermostat equations appear to be a good candidate for ergodicity , reproducing the second and fourth moments of @xmath21 within a fraction of a percent .",
    "we have not carried out the thorough investigation that would be required to establish their ergodicity as the single - thermostat models are not only simpler but also much more easily diagnosed because their sections are two - dimensional rather than three - dimensional .",
    "combining the ideas of `` weak control '' and the successful simultaneous thermostating of coordinates and momenta@xcite led to further trials attempting the weak control of two different kinetic - energy moments@xcite .",
    "one choice out of the hundreds investigated turned out to be successful for the harmonic oscillator : @xmath22 \\ .\\ ] ] these three oscillator equations passed all of the following tests for ergodicity :    [ 1 ] the moments @xmath23 were confirmed .",
    "[ 2 ] the independence of the largest lyapunov exponent to the initial conditions indicated the absence of the toroidal solutions .    [",
    "3 ] the separation of two nearby trajectories had an average value of 6 : + @xmath24 .    [ 4 ] the times spent at positive and negative values of @xmath25 were close to equal .    [ 5 ] the times spent in regions with each of the 3 !",
    "orderings of the three dependent variables were equal for long times .",
    "these five criteria were useful tools for confirming erogidicity .",
    "evidently weak control is the key to efficient ergodic thermostating of oscillator problems .",
    "the success in thermostating the harmonic oscillator led to like results for the simple pendulum but _ not _ for the quartic potential@xcite . see * figure 3*. this somewhat surprising setback motivates the need for more work and is the subject of the ian snook prize for 2016 .",
    "this prize will be awarded to the author(s ) of the most interesting original work exploring the ergodicity of single - thermostated statistical - mechanical systems .",
    "the systems are not at all limited to the examples of the quartic oscillator and the mexican hat potential but are left to the imagination and creativity of those entering the competition .",
