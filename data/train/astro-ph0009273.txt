    "the magellanic clouds ( mcs ) possess a large population of stellar clusters of a whole range of ages , including 13 _ bona fide _ old globular clusters in the lmc and only one somewhat younger counterpart in the smc .",
    "the photometry of these clusters has been extensively studied over the years , and especially since hst started producing high quality cmds reaching the very densest central part of the clusters ( olsen et al .",
    "@xcite , johnson et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the opportunities offered by these clusters are twofold : they provide laboratories to study stellar evolution in a range of different conditions ( the young and yet metal - poor mc clusters have no galactic counterparts and serve as a test of stellar evolution models at low metallicities ) , and give us the opportunity to study the formation and evolution of magellanic - type galaxies ( determination of the age - metallicity relation , etc  ) .",
    "it is with this second aspect that we will be dealing in this paper .    in particular , the oldest component of these stellar clusters ( the _ bona fide _ old metal - poor globular clusters )",
    "can serve as tracers of early epochs of the evolution ( halo phases ) in several ways : precise determination of ages of these old globular clusters yield estimates of the characteristic time - scales of halo formation ; information on the chemical evolution of the mcs at early stages of their evolution is kept in the atmosphere of the cluster stars ; kinematics of the clusters can be used as a tracer of halo structure .    while kinematics issues were addressed at length already some time ago ( e.g. schommer et al .",
    "@xcite ) , topics in need of precise metallicities were so far quite tentative : because of the faintness of their members , chemical composition of old and intermediate age clusters were not known with a very good accuracy ( low - resolution caii ir triplet , photometric estimates ) .",
    "we are now for the first time , thanks to vlt and its efficient spectrograph uves , in a position to improve dramatically this knowledge with detailed analysis of individual cluster giants fainter than 16 magnitudes .    as part of uves _ science verification _ , a sample of 10 giants in 4 clusters in a very wide age - range ( 0.1 to 15gyrs ) were observed at high spectral resolution ( r@xmath040000 ) . in this paper , we present the analysis of this data , derive oxygen and iron content of the four clusters , and use them to further constrain the age - metallicity relation in the lmc .",
    "we also present , for the first time , the evolution of the [ o / fe ] along time in the lmc , and briefly discuss the implications on the processes driving the chemical evolution of this dwarf irregular galaxy",
    ". a future paper ( in preparation ) will deal with the full analysis of the 20 elements measured in these giants and the full implication on the chemical evolution of the lmc .",

    "ngc1978 : _ the mean iron abundance derived from the 2 giants in ngc1978 is [ fe / h]=@xmath26 , whereas o91 derived @xmath27 from the two _ same _ stars .",
    "it has to be emphasized that these stars are the coolest giants of our sample , and the analysis of such objects is always difficult , due to the presence of molecular features , and to the more uncertain stellar parameter determination ( and gravity ) .",
    "however , a very simple test can be performed : in fig.[f-1866 - 1978 ] , we overplotted fei lines of ngc1978le8 and le9 to those of ngc1866b1653 .",
    "b1653 is at least 200k hotter than the ngc1978 giants , since it does not show any tio bands , whereas le8 and le9 do ( dissociation of tio is too efficient for hotter than 3900 - 4000k ) , and however , the fei lines of b1653 are larger than the ones of le8 or le9 .",
    "ngc1978 therefore _ has to be _ significantly more metal poor than @xmath28dex .",
    "another interesting issue is that ngc1978 has a high ellipticity and a broadened red giant branch and clump , that could be due to the merging of two individual clusters .",
    "alcaino et al .",
    "( @xcite ) proposes that the two clusters should have similar ages ( explaining the sharp turnoff region ) , but different metallicities ( differing by @xmath40.2dex ) depending on the location in the cluster .",
    "the two giants studied here are indeed located in the south - east of the cluster , where the most metal - poor population is expected .",
    "it would be extremely interesting to study systematically the abundances of individual stars as a function of location in the cluster and in the cmd .",
    "oxygen abundances in evolved red giant stars , can be affected by internal mixing phenomena bringing internally - processed material to the surface of the star .",
    "the oxygen abundance observed at the surface of the star in this case is not the same as the one the star was born with . before using [ o / fe ] ratios for chemical evolution purposes",
    ", we therefore checked the status of mixing in our stars .    in the cno cycle of hydrogen burning ,",
    "the final oxygen abundance is very little affected , the cycle basically turning c into n. so that giants experiencing `` normal '' shallow mixing do not show depleted nor enhanced oxygen .",
    "however , other cycles involving oxygen , such as the ne - na and the mg - al cycles may occur at hotter temperature and hence deeper inside the star .",
    "if mixing mechanisms reach deep enough within the star , the products of such cycles can be brought up to the surface , where depleted o and mg , and enhanced na and al can be observed .",
    "a very good tracer of deep mixing are the anti - correlations o - na , mg - al , or the even more spectacular o - al . in our galaxy , giants in globular clusters and similar giants in the field",
    "do not behave similarly : while o - na o - al anti - correlations are commonly observed in globular clusters of various metallicities ( e.g. shetrone @xcite , kraft et al .",
    "@xcite ) , field stars of comparable evolutionary stage and metallicities show no such trends .",
    "this difference is generally attributed to environment effects within the clusters .    in fig.[f - mix ] , we have plotted the data points of the 5 giants in the 2 older lmc clusters ( eso121-sc03 and ngc2210 ) together with data for classical galactic globular clusters of three different metallicities covering the same metallicity range as the lmc clusters .",
    "m92 has a [ fe / h]=@xmath29 , m13 , m5 and ngc7006 have [ fe / h ] from @xmath30 to @xmath31 , and m71 is more metal - rich with [ fe / h]=@xmath32 .",
    "all data ( galactic clusters and field ) are from shetrone ( @xcite ) , except ngc7006 which is from kraft et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the upper panel shows how the al overabundances are linked to the evolutionary stage of the giants ( where m@xmath33 traces evolution ) , and in the lower panel is displayed the o - al anti - correlation .",
    "also displayed are the galactic field giants , which clearly do not follow the same trend , although spanning the same m@xmath33 range .    out of our five lmc",
    "old cluster giants , however , only one ( ngc2210b4364 ) has a high [ al / fe ] ratio , while the four others have [ al / fe ] ratios similar or even slightly lower than those of the field giants of comparable bolometric magnitudes , suggesting that these four giants _ have not experienced major deep mixing events_. the anti - correlation between [ al / fe ] and [ o / fe ] is also not observed as such ( the lmc sample is far too small ) , but as expected , the star which is al - rich is also o - poor : b4364 has most probably dredged up material processed through ne - na and mg - al cycles .    from panel b. of fig.[f - mix ] , it is striking that not only are the [ al / fe ] ratios low compared to galactic globular cluster stars , but that the lmc globular cluster giants seem to define a lower - envelope to the anti - correlation : [ o / fe ] seems to be systematically lower in the lmc giants . galactic cluster giants which have [ al / fe ] close to zero ( where the deep mixing mechanism is not acting ) , have [ o / fe ] values of the order of + 0.4dex , whereas our four lmc giants with low al have [ o / fe]=+0.15 to + 0.20dex .",
    "if confirmed on larger samples , this [ o / fe ] difference between lmc and galactic clusters could be attributed to a difference in the chemical evolution of the two galaxies .",
    "many papers have recently discussed the ages of the old magellanic clusters compared to their galactic counterparts ( johnson el al .",
    "@xcite , olsen et al .",
    "@xcite , brocato et al .",
    "@xcite ) , coming to the common conclusion that galactic and magellanic clusters could have been drawn from the same parent population .",
    "however , all age determination methods are dependent ( through direct or less direct ways ) on the assumed chemical composition of the clusters ( overall metallicities but also @xmath25-element abundances ) .",
    "we are now for the first time , in a position to improve dramatically this knowledge with precise abundances of individual cluster giants .",
    "eso121-sco3 and ngc1866 were found to have the same metallicity as previous estimations and , as a consequence , no effect on the age of these clusters is expected .    for ngc2210 , on the other hand , our [ fe / h ] determination is + 0.25dex higher than the value generally assumed to determine the age of the cluster .",
    "age determination by isochrone turnoff fitting is sensitive to the adopted metallicity , an increase of 0.25dex inducing up to 2gyrs younger ages ( cf figure 10 of johnson et al .",
    "but we found on the other hand , that ngc2210 is oxygen poor compared to similar galactic clusters , by @xmath340.2dex . in this case , the opposite effect on the isochrones locus of a higher iron and lower @xmath25-element content cancels out almost exactly , so that the age of ngc2210 should remain very similar to the age of the old galactic clusters .",
    "ngc1978 was found 0.54dex more metal deficient than previous estimations , but the stars we have studied are rather cool and this result is more uncertain .",
    "if this metallicity is confirmed , the effect on age would be of a few tenths of billion years , making the cluster @xmath410 - 20% older than its current 2.2gyrs estimate .",
    "the lmc cluster distribution has a long - known peculiarity : both metallicity and age distributions are bimodal , with a well defined _ gap _ between 3 - 4gyrs and 10 - 12gyrs , corresponding to a minimum of the metallicity distribution between @xmath341.0 and @xmath341.5dex .",
    "this bimodality has been interpreted as the signature of two bursts of star formation , an early one giving birth to the 12 - 15gyrs clusters and a more recent one some 3gyrs ago , possibly triggered by tidal interaction of the lmc with our milky way .",
    "although the validity of such a conclusion on the global history of the lmc is still a matter of debate ( is the cluster formation directly linked to the global star formation ?",
    "what is the current rate of cluster disruption in the lmc and what was it in the past ? ) , it is of great interest to investigate whether hints of this bimodal star formation can also be found in the age - metallicity relation . both clusters",

    "in both cases , as first claimed by dopita et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , the age - metallicity distribution seems to be compatible with a burst of star formation some 3gyrs ago , triggering an increase of metal - abundances by a factor @xmath43 around this age .",
    "of course , our sample is too small to be conclusive by itself , but the confirmation that there indeed exist clusters ( ngc1978 ) as young as 2gyrs and as metal - poor as clusters of ages 9 - 10gyrs ( eso121-sco3 ) is by itself an interesting conclusion .",
    "the most powerful tool available to study the chemical evolution of a galaxy is to follow the behaviour , along time , of the abundance of elements which trace various nucleosynthetic channels and sites . in particular , the evolution of elements produced in different mass - range progenitor stars , gives insight on the imf and the sfr of the parent galaxy .",
    "the most well known such ratio is the [ o / fe ] , which evolution along time ( or metallicity ) allows to constrain the ratio of the number of massive supernovae ( snii ) over supernovae type ia ( snia ) . up to recently the detailed study of the chemical composition of magellanic objects were mainly restricted to the brightest stars , namely the young supergiants ( cf e.g. luck et al .",
    "@xcite , hill et al .",
    "@xcite ) and to the hii regions , which trace matter younger than @xmath00.1 gyr .",
    "we are now in the position to _ follow along time _ , the evolution of element ratios .    in the hypothesis",
    "that oxygen has not been depleted in the four old lmc cluster giants ( all except ngc2210b4364 , see section [ mixing ] ) , we can now understand the chemical evolution implications of the observed [ o / fe ] ratios .",

    "their prescriptions include a [ o / fe ] ratio at present time such that [ o / fe]@xmath36=[o / fe]@xmath37 at present time .",
    "two models are considered : one where the sfr is continuous , and the other where two bursts occur 14gyrs and 3  gyrs ago respectively . on the other hand , on the right panel of fig .",

    "@xcite , pagel & tautvaiiene @xcite ) , this value should not be taken as absolute , but in reference to stars of similar type in the sn , which also give [ o / fe]@xmath36=@xmath130.2 to @xmath130.3dex , so that one can safely assume that [ o / fe]@xmath36=[o / fe]@xmath37 at present time . ]",
    "the imf needed to fulfill this constraint ( where [ o / fe]@xmath38[o / fe]@xmath37 ) is steeper in the lmc than in the sn ( in both continuous and bursting sfr models ) .",
    "interestingly , none of the two families of models appear to be able to reproduce the observed [ o / fe ] of lmc clusters : while tsujimoto et al .",
    "( @xcite ) can almost reproduce the low [ o / fe ] of the metal - poor cluster ( thanks to their steeper imf ) , they can not reproduce the relatively high [ o / fe ] of the younger clusters at all ; pagel & tautvaiiene ( @xcite ) on the other hand , predict compatible [ o / fe ] in the young population , but too high [ o / fe ] for the older clusters .",
    "the main lesson which can be learned from fig .",
    "[ f - osfe ] is that , if the low [ o / fe ] ratio in the older lmc clusters is confirmed , then the [ o / fe ] run with increasing metallicity would be extremely flat .",
    "this is a hint that the lmc chemical evolution might have been driven by a different fraction of snii / sni than in our own galaxy , sn  i contributing a larger fraction of the iron in the lmc than in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "this finding is still speculative at this point , as we definitely need larger samples , both of globular cluster and old field giants in the lmc to demonstrate it .",
    "also , extending this work to the smc would be a complementary approach to understand the role of the parent galaxy morphology on chemical evolution .",
