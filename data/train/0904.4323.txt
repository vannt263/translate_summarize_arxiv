    "the 517 nm light is produced from a fiber amplified diode laser centered at 1034 nm .",
    "we use an external cavity diode laser in a littrow configuration followed by a 40 db optical isolator .",
    "typically the output after the isolator is 15 mw and about 10 mw is injected into a two - stage yb - doped fiber amplifier ( ydfa ) system .",

    "the method used for calculation of the magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole hyperfine structure constants @xmath16 and @xmath17 for the @xmath18 state is a combination of the configuration interaction ( ci ) method with many - body perturbation theory ( mbpt )  @xcite .",
    "initially the method was developed for calculating energy levels .",
    "the mbpt was used to construct an effective hamiltonian for valence electrons .",

    "the energies and wave functions are determined from the equation @xmath19 where the effective hamiltonian is defined as @xmath20 here @xmath21 is the hamiltonian in the frozen core approximation and @xmath22 is the energy - dependent correction , which takes into account virtual core excitations .    in order to calculate other atomic observables , one needs to construct the corresponding effective operators for valence electrons @xcite .",
    "in particular , the effective operator of the hyperfine interaction used in this work accounts for the core - valence and core - core correlations . to account for shielding of an externally applied field by core electrons",
