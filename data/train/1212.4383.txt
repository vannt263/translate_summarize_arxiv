    "for almost thirty years after the discovery of the @xmath0 and its excitations , the so - called november revolution  @xcite , heavy hadron spectroscopy was at rest .",
    "paraphrasing lord kelvin famous speech  @xcite , by 2003 there were only two clouds on the horizon obscuring _ the beauty and clearness of the dynamical theory_. in the hadron spectra these _ two clouds _ were on the one hand the missing resonance problem , i.e. , all quark models predict a proliferation of excited states which have not been measured , and , on the other hand , the observation by babar of an open - charm meson , the @xmath1 , whose properties were quite different from those predicted by quark potential models .    since those peaceful days",
    "an increase on both amount and quality of experimental data has shown quite a different picture , far more involved and convoluted , with the observation of the well - known @xmath2 , the @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and several other states .",
    "based on gell - mann conjecture  @xcite the hadronic experimental data were classified either as @xmath7 or @xmath8 states according to @xmath9 irreducible representations , nowadays this hypothesis may be in question . therefore , the study of the role played by higher order fock space components in the hadron spectra , allowed by the gell - mann classification , is an interesting issue to address .    in this talk",
    "we give an overview of a project for getting a coherent understanding of the low - energy hadron phenomenology from the perspective of constituent quark models  @xcite .",
    "we will make emphasis on three different aspects .",
    "firstly , we will address the study of meson spectroscopy in an enlarged hilbert space considering many - quark components .",
    "this seems nowadays unavoidable to understand the experimental data and it builds a bridge towards the description in terms of hadronic degrees of freedom .",
    "secondly , the same scheme used to describe the hadron spectroscopy should be valid for describing the low - energy meson - meson scattering .",
    "in other words , contributions to the hadron spectroscopy arising from many - quark components allowed in the gell - mann scheme , should also be recovered by means of hadron - hadron scattering using a full set of states .",
    "finally , we will review our recent efforts to describe the structure of heavy baryons containing charm or bottom quarks .",
    "many - quark systems present a richer , and therefore more complicated , color structure than standard hadrons built with a quark - antiquark pair or three quarks .",
    "while the color wave function for ordinary mesons and baryons leads to a single vector , in the case of four  quark states there are different vectors driving to a singlet color state out of either colorless or colored quark - antiquark two - body components .",
    "thus , when dealing with four  quark states a basic important question is whether we are in front of a single colorless meson  meson molecule or a compact state , defined as a system with two - body colored components . whereas the first structure would be natural in the naive quark model , the second one would open a new area in hadron spectroscopy .",
    "let us start by defining a _ physical channel _ as a four - quark state made of two quark - antiquark color singlets . in ref .",
    "@xcite the formalism to evaluate the probability of the different physical channels for an arbitrary four  quark wave function was derived . for this purpose",
    "any hidden ",
    "color vector of a four  quark color basis , i.e. , vectors with non  singlet internal color couplings , was expanded in terms of singlet  singlet color vectors .",
    "such a procedure gives rise to a wave function expanded in terms of nonorthogonal vectors belonging to different orthogonal basis , and therefore the determination of the probability of physical channels becomes cumbersome .",
    "such nonorthogonal expansions are common in other fields of science , like chemical physics  @xcite , however they have not been properly discussed until now in the context of the multiquark phenomenology , i.e. , _ color chemistry_. we have derived the two hermitian operators that are well  defined projectors on the physical singlet ",
    "singlet color states @xmath10 and @xmath11 . using these operators the probabilities for finding singlet  singlet color components for an arbitrary four - quark state @xmath12",
    "are given by , @xmath13})&=&\\frac{1}{2(1-|\\,_c\\left\\langle 11 \\mid 1'1 ' \\right\\rangle_c|^2 ) } \\left [ \\left\\langle\\psi\\mid p\\hat q \\mid\\psi\\right\\rangle + \\left\\langle\\psi\\mid \\hat q p \\mid\\psi\\right\\rangle\\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ p^{\\mid\\psi\\rangle}({[1'1']})&=&\\frac{1}{2(1-|\\,_c\\left\\langle 11 \\mid 1'1 ' \\right\\rangle_c|^2 ) } \\left [ \\left\\langle\\psi\\mid \\hat p q \\mid\\psi\\right\\rangle + \\left\\langle\\psi\\mid q \\hat p \\mid\\psi\\right\\rangle\\right ] \\",
    ", , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the projectors over the different color vectors , @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively .",
    "the stability of a four  quark state relies on @xmath18 , the energy difference between its mass and that of the lowest two - meson threshold .",
    "it is important to emphasize the relevance of comparing four  quark energies with respect to thresholds obtained using the same quark - quark interaction as in the four  quark case . only in doing",
    "so one may guarantee that no spurious bound states are obtained .",
    "@xmath19 indicates that all fall - apart decay channels are forbidden , and therefore one has a proper bound state .",
    "@xmath20 will indicate that the four  quark solution corresponds to an unbound threshold ( two free mesons ) .",
    "as we will discuss below , between these two limits one may find molecular states .",
    ".four  quark state properties for selected quantum numbers .",
    "the notation @xmath21 stands for mesons @xmath22 and @xmath23 with relative orbital angular momentum @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath25 $ ] and @xmath26 $ ] stand for the probability of the color components in different basis  . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "to summarize this talk , we have reviewed some recent results of hadron spectroscopy and hadron - hadron interaction from the point of view of the constituent quark model .",
    "the constituent quark model is a powerful tool at our disposal to face the new issues appearing in an almost daily basis in the heavy quark sector .",
    "unfortunately , the downsides of such robust tools lie in the risk of misusing them .",
    "therefore , we have tried to impress upon the reader the range of validity and proper formalisms of the constituent quark model .",
    "similarly , since there are many different models in the literature , we have tried to present conclusions that are independent of the particularities of the model chosen .",
    "we have seen how the enlargement of the hilbert space when increasing energy , that was seen to be necessary to describe the nucleon - nucleon phenomenology above the pion production threshold , seems to be necessary to understand current problems of hadron spectroscopy .",
    "we have also tried to emphasize that spectroscopy and interaction can , and must , be understood within the same scheme when dealing with quark models .",
    "any other alternative becomes irrelevant from the point of view of learning about properties of qcd .",
    "it is expected that in the coming years better - quality data on all sectors discussed in this talk will become available and our results can be used to analyze these upcoming data in a model  independent way .",
