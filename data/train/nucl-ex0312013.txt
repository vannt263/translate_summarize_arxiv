    "since an introduction to the science of double - beta decay ( ) was discussed by another speaker at this meeting@xcite , only the critical points necessary for the discussion in this paper will be summarized here .",
    "reference @xcite is a recent review .    the zero - neutrino double - beta decay ( ) rate ( @xmath0 ) , is directly related to neutrino mass .",
    "@xmath0 is proportional to the square of the effective majorana neutrino mass ( ) , an easily calculable phase space factor ( @xmath1 ) , and a difficult - to - calculate nuclear matrix element ( ) ;    @xmath2    the value for  in turn , depends on the values of the individual neutrino mass eigenstates ( @xmath3 ) , the mixing matrix elements ( @xmath4 ) and the majorana phases ( @xmath5 ) ;    @xmath6    to deduce information on @xmath3 from a measurement of @xmath0 requires values for @xmath7 and . in this report , we discuss how the uncertainties in these factors affect the conclusions on @xmath3 .",
    "in addition we summarize the proposals for future   measurements .",
    "the results of the oscillation experiments provide data on the mixing matrix elements and the differences in the squares of the mass eigenvalues ( @xmath8 ) . from the atmospheric neutrino data",
    ", we have @xmath9 ev@xmath10(90% cl ) and @xmath11 degrees@xcite . the combined results of the solar neutrino experiments and the reactor experiments@xcite give @xmath12 ev@xmath10 and @xmath13 degrees ( 68% cl ) .",
    "( note that other authors have found modestly different results .",
    "e.g. _ refs . @xcite . ) from reactor experiments , we have a limit on @xmath14 degrees@xcite ( 68% cl ) .",
    "if there are only 3 neutrinos , then these two @xmath15 values define the mass spectrum given any one of the masses .",
    "however , the hierarchy of the mass spectrum is not yet known . in the convention used in this paper",
    ", @xmath16 is predominately composed of the mass eigenstate @xmath17 .",
    "the hierarchy uncertainty can be simply stated : is @xmath17 the lightest mass eigenstate ?    the central values of these results and eqn .",
    "[ eqn:2 ] determine a range of  values for a given value of @xmath18 .",
    "many authors have done this analysis ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ refs .",
    "@xcite . ) and fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] shows the result of the calculation .",
    "the bands indicate the range of possible values for arbritrary values of the phases .",
    "the borders indicate the cp conserving values of the phases , @xmath19 .",
    "the observation of  would have profound phyiscs implications regardless of the size of the uncertianty in the deduced value of .",
    "it would show that neutrinos are massive majorana particles and that the total lepton number is not a conserved quantity .",
    "but it is interesting to ask whether one can use a measurement of  to discern these two hierarchies . at high values of the minimum neutrino mass ,",
    "the mass spectrum is quasi - degenerate , and the bands are not resolved . at values of the minimum neutrino mass below @xmath2050 mev , the degenerate band",
    "splits into two bands representing the normal ( @xmath18 lightest ) and inverted ( @xmath21 lightest ) hierarchy cases .",
    "figure [ fig:1 ] indicates that it would be straight - forward to identify the appropriate band at these low mass values .",
    "however , there are uncertainties in the oscillation parameters and the matrix elements that are not represented in the figure",
    ".    one can address this question by comparing the maximum value for the normal hierarchy ( @xmath22 ) with the minimum value for the inverted hierarchy ( @xmath23 ) that can result from the parameter uncertainies .",
    "when the lightest neutrino mass is small , one can write expressions for the maximum value for the normal hierarchy case and the minimum value for the inverted hierarchy case@xcite .",
    "when @xmath18 is near zero , @xmath22 occurs for constructive interference between the contributions from the @xmath24 and @xmath21 terms when cp is conserved .",
    "@xmath25    from eqn .",
    "[ eqn:3 ] , it is clear that @xmath22 is maximal when @xmath26 is maximum , @xmath27 is maximum and the @xmath15 are maximum .",
    "@xmath23 is minimal with the same conditions on @xmath26 and @xmath27 , but for a minimum value for @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29    if we use the appropriate extremum values for the oscillation parameters in eqns .",
    "[ eqn:3 ] and [ eqn:4 ] , we find @xmath30 mev@xmath31 mev@xmath32 mev and @xmath33 mev@xmath34 mev .",
    "these numbers are sufficienty different , at least when using these low - cl uncertainty ranges , that it would appear one could discriminate between the two solutions .",
    "since the precision of the oscillation parameters is likely to improve with future experiments , they would not appear to be the primary concern .",
    "even so , how critical each parameter is for this analysis can be determined by propagating its uncertainty to the  uncertainty .",
    "such a propagation - of - errors analysis is shown in table [ table:3 ] and it is clear that @xmath26 affects @xmath22 a great deal .",
    "its also clear that @xmath28 is critical for @xmath23 .",
    "finally , @xmath27 is important for both .",
    "this propagation - of - error analysis , however , does nt elucidate the effect that @xmath27 also has on fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the value of the lightest mass for which the cancellation drives  to very small values depends critically on @xmath27 . but note that as long as the data indicates that the solar mixing is substantially separated from maximal , the cancellation is possible only over a narrow range of values for the lightest mass .",
    "all in all , the need to interpret @xmath0 provides additional motivation to improve the precision on @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]      +      the enriched xenon observatory ( exo)@xcite proposes to use up to 10 t of 60 - 80% enriched @xmath35xe .",
    "the unique aspect of this proposal is the plan to detect the @xmath35ba daughter ion correlated with the decay .",
    "if the technique is perfected , it would eliminate all background except that associated with .",
    "the real - time optical detection of the daughter ba ion , initially suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , might be possible if the ion can be localized and probed with lasers .",
    "the spectroscopy has been used for ba@xmath36 ions in atom traps .",
    "however , the additional technology to detect single ba ions in a condensed medium or to extract single ba ions from a condensed medium and trap them must be demonstrated for this application .    the exo plan is to use liquid xe ( lxe ) scintillator .",
    "the lxe concept has the advantage of being much smaller than a gaseous tpc due to the high density of lxe .",
    "once the ba ion is localized via its scintillation and ionization , it might be extracted via a cold finger electrode coated in frozen xe ( m. vient , unpublished observation , 1991 ) .",
    "the ion is electrostatically attracted to the cold finger which later can be heated to evaporate the xe and release the ba ion into a radio frequency quadrupole trap .",
    "at that point , the ba@xmath37 is neutralized to ba@xmath36 , laser cooled and optically detected .    the collaboration has recently performed experiments to optimize the energy resolution@xcite . by measuring both scintillation light and ionization simultaneously , they have achieved energy resolution sufficient for the experiment . tests to determine the viability of the ba extraction process",
    "are also being performed .",
    "the exo collaboration has received funding to proceed with a 200-kg enriched xe detector without ba tagging .",
    "this initial prototype will operate at the waste isolation pilot plant ( wipp ) in southern new mexico .",
    "the progress and understanding of ge detectors has been developed over more than 30 years of experience .",
    "the potential of these detectors lie in their great energy resolution , ease of operation , and the extensive experience relating to the reduction of backgrounds .",
    "this potential is not yet exhausted as is evidenced by the genius and majorana proposals .",
    "the genius ( germanium nitrogen underground setup)@xcite proposal has evolved from the heidelberg - moscow ( hm ) experiment .",
    "the driving design principle behind this proposed ge detector array experiment is the evidence that the dominant background in the hm experiment was due to radioactivity external to the ge .",
    "( the reader should contrast this with the motivation for the design of the majorana proposal described below . )",
    "an array of 2.5-kg , p - type ge crystals would be operated  naked \" within a large liquid nitrogen ( ln ) bath . by using naked crystals ,",
    "the external activity would be moved to outside the ln region .",
    "due to its low stopping power , roughly 12 m of ln is required to shield the crystals from the ambient @xmath38-ray flux at the intended experimental site at gran sasso .",
    "a test of the naked operation of a crystal in a 50 l dewar has been successful@xcite .",
    "the proposal anticipates an energy resolution of @xmath39 kev fwhm ( 0.3% ) and a threshold of 11 kev .",
    "the value of this low threshold is set by x rays from cosmogenic activities . using 1 t of 86% enriched ge detectors , the target mass is large enough for dark matter studies .",
    "in fact a 10-kg @xmath40ge proof - of - principle experiment for dark matter studies has begun at gran sasso@xcite .      the majorana collaboration plans to use @xmath20 500 , 86% enriched , segmented ge crystals for a total of 500 kg of detector@xcite . the cryostat would be formed from very pure electroformed cu@xcite .",
    "their analysis indicated that @xmath41ge contained within the ge detectors was the limiting background for their  search .",
    "( contrast this with the genius approach described above . ) the proposal s design therefore emphasizes segmentation and pulse shape discrimination to reject this background .",
    "@xmath41ge produces a background that deposits energy at multiple sites in the detector .",
    "in contrast , a  event will have a localized energy deposit .",
    "segmentation of the crystals permits a veto of such events .",
    "furthermore , distinct ionization events will have a different pulse shape than a localized event .",
    "thus pulse shape analysis can also reject background .",
    "the collaboration is fielding a close - packed array of 18 ge detectors , 16 of which will share a lone cryostat .",
    "this prototype , called mega@xcite , will demonstrate the cryogenic cooling design for multiple crystals in a single low - background cryostat .",
    "it will also permit a study of crystal - to - crystal coincidence suppression of backgrounds for  and dark matter .",
    "finally , the operation of mega at wipp will provide an excellent material screening facility in addition to a very sensitive apparatus for studying  to excited states .",
    "these later experiments will be conducted by placing samples within the mega detector arrangement . the high efficiency for @xmath38-ray detection will provide the sensitivity for observing the two @xmath38 rays from the excited state relaxation .",
    "in addition , the collaboration is studying the performance of several segmented detector configurations .",
    "this program , call sega@xcite , will establish the background rejection capabilities of segmented detectors experimentally and confirm the previous monte carlo studies .",
    "pulse shape discrimination tends to identify multiple energy deposits along the radial direction in crystals whereas the segmentation tends to identify multiple deposits axially and azimuthally .",
    "the sega program will measure the orthogonality of these cuts .",
    "there are 3 segmented geometries that will be studied ; ( 1 ) a custom designed , isotopically enriched , 12-segment detector ( 2 ) a stock - item commercially available clover ( tm ) detector from canberra and ( 3 ) a many - segmented detector originally obtained for studies for the greta project@xcite .",
    "the 12-segmented enriched detector will also operate at wipp , both as a stand - alone unit and also as one of the detectors comprising the mega apparatus .",
    "the moon ( mo observatory of neutrinos ) proposal@xcite plans to use @xmath42mo as a  source and as a target for solar neutrinos .",
    "this dual purpose and a sensitivity to low - energy supernova electron neutrinos@xcite make it an enticing idea .",
    "@xmath42mo has a high q - value ( 3.034 mev ) , which results in a large phase space factor and places the  peak region well above most radioactive backgrounds .",
    "it also has hints of a favorable  but unfortunately it has a relatively short .",
    "the experiment will make energy and angular correlation studies of  to select  events and to reject backgrounds .",
    "the planned moon configuration is a supermodule of scintillator and mo ensembles .",
    "one option is a module of plastic fiber scintillators with thin ( 20 mg / cm@xmath10 ) layers of mo , arranged to achieve a position resolution comparable to the fiber diameter ( 2 - 3 mm ) .",
    "the project needs mo and scintillator radioactive impurity levels less than 1 mbq / ton .",
    "this can be achieved by carbonyl chemistry for mo and plastics can be produced cleanly .",
    "the simulations of the scintillator - film sandwich design indicate that the energy resolution for the  peak will be @xmath205% fwhm , which is at the upper end of the range of feasibility for a sub 50 mev  experiment .",
    "metal - loaded liquid scintillator and bolometer options are also being considered .",
    "the bolometer option would remove the resolution concerns .",
    "use of enriched @xmath42mo is feasible , as it can be enriched by either gas centrifuge or laser ionization separation .",
    "enrichment would reduce the total volume of the apparatus resulting in a lower internal radioactivity contribution to the background by an order of magnitude .",
    "there are too many additional proposals in table [ table:2 ] for detailed description but i mention the remaining ones here",
    ". the cameo proposal@xcite would use 1000 kg of scintillating @xmath44cdwo@xmath45 crystals situated within the borexino apparatus .",
    "the borexino liquid scintillator would provide shielding from external radioactivity and light piping of crystal events to the photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) array surrounding the system .",
    "similarly , the candles proposal@xcite ( calcium floride for study of neutrino and dark matter by low energy spectrometer ) plans to immerse caf@xmath46 in liquid scintillator .",
    "the scintillation light from the @xmath47 of @xmath48ca will be detected via pmts .",
    "two groups@xcite have been studying the use of gso crystals ( gd@xmath46sio@xmath49:ce ) for the study of  in @xmath50gd .",
    "cobra ( cdte o neutrino double beta research apparatus)@xcite would use cdte or cdznte semiconductors to search for  in either cd or te .",
    "1600 1-@xmath51 crystals would provide 10 kg of material .",
    "gem is a proposal@xcite that is very similar to that of genius .",
    "however , much of the ln shielding would be replaced with pure water .",
    "the drift chamber beta - ray analyzer ( dcba ) proposal@xcite is for a three - dimensional tracking chamber in a uniform magnetic field .",
    "thin plates of nd would form the source .",
    "the series of nemo experiments is progressing with nemo-3@xcite that began operation in 2002 .",
    "the detector contains a source foil enclosed between tracking chambers that is itself enclosed within a scintillator array .",
    "nemo-3 can contain a total of 10 kg of source and plans to operate with several different isotopes , but with @xmath42mo being the most massive at 7 kg .",
    "the collaboration is also discussing the possibility of building a 100-kg experiment that would be called nemo-4 .",
    "there are two additional groups proposing to use @xmath35xe to study .",
    "caccianiga and giammarchi@xcite propose to dissolve 1.56 t of enriched xe in liquid scintillator .",
    "the xmass@xcite collaboration proposes to use 10 t of liquid xenon for solar neutrino studies .",
    "the detector would have sensitivity to .",
    "this is a very exciting time for .",
    "the next generation of experiments will be sensitive to a mass region where neutrino masses are known to exist . as a result",
    ", even null experiments will have an impact on our understanding of the mass spectrum .",
    "the subtleies associated with the uncertainties in @xmath7 and are of secondary importance .",
    "if  is observed , the physics learned will be revolutionary as it would establish the neutrino as a massive majorana particle .",
