    "by now , there have been a number of experiments which point to a flavor asymmetry in the sea of the proton @xcite .",
    "although the exclusion principle @xcite and charge asymmetry @xcite may contribute to the observed asymmetries , they are not sufficiently large to explain the data @xcite .",
    "the two most noteworthy experiments are the deviation of the gottfried sum rule from 1/3 , i.e. , @xmath1 @xcite and the recent drell - yan measurements of @xmath2 by e866 @xcite and na51 @xcite .",
    "the cern measurement gives @xmath3 at @xmath4 and the fermilab one obtains the major part of the @xmath5-distribution of @xmath6 , finding @xmath7 at @xmath8 .",
    "the most reasonable explanation of these large deviations from unity or 1/3 is that there is a flavor asymmetry in the sea quark distributions ; this flavor asymmetry is readily understood if a meson cloud surrounds the quarks , in that a proton can change into a neutron by emitting a @xmath9 , as first pointed out by thomas @xcite and later by henley and miller @xcite .",
    "the sullivan process allows one to calculate the @xmath5-distribution of the asymmetry , as has been done by speth and collaborators @xcite and others ( see @xcite for references ) ; reasonable agreement with experiment is obtained .",
    "+ more recently , alberg et al .",
    "@xcite have pointed out that a test of the meson cloud model is feasible by carrying out drell - yan experiments with @xmath10 beams on protons and deuterium . in this model , the flavor asymmetry in the @xmath0 , for instance , is expected to be even larger than in the proton ( @xmath11 ) , so that @xmath2 should be much larger than 1 .",
    "this is in contrast to the prediction of su(3 ) , under which @xmath12 by @xmath13 , from which it follows that @xmath14 in the @xmath0 .",
    "+ in this paper we use the convolution method with the sullivan process to calculate the valence and sea quark distributions of the @xmath0 in the meson cloud model .",
    "in the convolution method , the physical @xmath0 wave function is composed of the following fock states @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the probability amplitude to find a physical @xmath0 in a state consisting of a virtual baryon @xmath17 and a virtual meson @xmath18 with longitudinal momentum fractions @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and transverse momenta @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "the wave function renormalization factor @xmath23 is a measure of the probability of finding the `` bare '' @xmath0 , that is the @xmath0 without a meson cloud in the physical @xmath0 . + we assume that the @xmath24 will have components @xmath25 , + @xmath26 , @xmath27)$ ] and @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "we neglect higher mass components .",
    "+ in the infinite momentum frame ( imf , @xmath29 with @xmath30 the @xmath0 momentum ) the contribution of a certain fock state , @xmath31 , to the @xmath0 quark distribution can be written in terms of its quark components as @xmath32 where the splitting functions @xmath33 and @xmath34 are related to the probability amplitude @xmath35 in the imf via @xmath36 @xmath37 in terms of these splitting functions the wave function renormalization constant z is given by @xmath38^{-1}\\equiv [ 1+\\sum_{bm}\\int_0 ^ 1f_{bm/ \\sigma^+}(y)dy \\;]^{-1 } , \\ ] ] and the quark distribution functions @xmath39 of a @xmath0 within the fock state expansion are given as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the quark distribution of the bare @xmath0 .",
    "+ the next step is to calculate the splitting functions @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "we do this using time ordered perturbation theory ( topt ) in the imf , following the steps of reference @xcite . in topt in the imf",
    "one can write the probability amplitudes @xmath44 explicitly as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the invariant mass squared of the intermediate @xmath31 fock state @xmath47 and @xmath48 denotes the vertex function in the imf - limit .",
    "vertices involving point - like particles automatically fulfill the symmetry relation @xmath49 but since hadrons have an extended structure one has to introduce phenomenological vertex form factors which parameterize the unknown microscopic effects .",
    "therefore the vertex function @xmath50 is replaced by @xmath51@xmath50 and from equation ( 9 ) we get the restriction @xmath52    this is satisfied by the exponential form @xcite @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a cut - off parameter which we use in our further calculations .",
    "+ equations ( 3 ) and ( 7 ) allow us to write the splitting functions as @xmath55 ^ 2}.\\ ] ] one gets the spin averaged vertex functions in the imf from the interaction lagrangian density @xmath56 where @xmath57 denotes a baryon @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath0 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 a pseudo scalar field @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 @xcite . for the vertex @xmath65 the vertex function @xmath66",
    "is given by @xmath67 @xmath68 and when spin averaged we obtain @xmath69 hence , in our case the splitting function is given by @xmath70 ^ 2}.\\ ] ] using the following coupling constants g @xcite +    @xmath71 = @xmath72 + @xmath73 @xmath74 + @xmath75 @xmath74 + @xmath76 @xmath77 +    and the cutoff parameter @xmath78 gev for most of our work , @xcite we just need the quark distributions in the bare particles as an additional input . + for some of the following , we use holtmann s parameterization of the quark distribution function in the bare nucleon @xcite",
    "in which he assumes a symmetric sea , @xmath79 @xmath80",
    "@xmath81 @xmath82 @xmath83 in addition to this form for @xmath79 , we also take a form which is tied to the recent determination of the gluon distribution @xcite , @xmath84 since the gluon splits into the `` perturbative '' or bare sea quarks , this distribution should be close to that of those quarks . the advantage of this choice will become clear in the next section . for the quark distribution in the pion",
    "@xcite we take @xmath85 @xmath86 where 20% of the pion s momentum is assumed to be carried by the symmetrical sea , which is presumed to be due to gluon splitting .",
    "+ to begin with , we determined the quark distributions of the bare hyperons by using su(3 ) symmetry for the valence quarks ; that is we neglected the mass difference between the @xmath87 and @xmath88 and @xmath89 quarks .",
    "we do not show the results because we do not believe that this is a realistic choice .",
    "look at the @xmath90 .",
    "experiments @xcite show that @xmath91 using this we can take the parametrization for the quark distribution in the pion to get the @xmath92 distribution in the @xmath93 and through charge independence the @xmath94 distribution in the @xmath90 . to get the s distribution in the @xmath90 we assume that the gluon and the light sea quark distributions in the kaon and the pion are the same and",
    "hence carry the same momentum fraction in both particles .",
    "we also assume the following form of the s quark distribution @xmath95 where the parameter @xmath96 is determined by matching up the right momentum fraction .",
    "the valence quark distributions in the @xmath90 are then given by @xmath97 @xmath98 compared to the pion , where @xmath99 and @xmath100 look the same , the s distribution in the @xmath90 now peaks at higher @xmath5 than the @xmath94 distribution , which reflects the fact that the s quark is heavier than the u and the d. + our starting point for the bare @xmath0 is holtmann s parametrization for the bare nucleon , equations 18 - 21 .",
    "again we assume only a change in the @xmath101-part of the parametrizations and that the light sea quarks and gluons in the bare @xmath0 and the bare nucleon look the same . to account for the higher mass of the s quark",
    "we then make the ansatz @xmath102 where we take model dependent constituent quark masses to get @xmath103 the quark distributions in the bare @xmath0 are then @xmath104 @xmath105 @xmath106 we can also determine the distributions in the bare @xmath59 and @xmath107 via charge independence and su(3 ) :    @xmath59 : = @xmath108 = @xmath107 : = @xmath109 + @xmath110 @xmath111 + @xmath112 @xmath113 + @xmath114 @xmath115 .",
    "+    since we assume no change in the symmetric sea of the bare particles , the only variance in the antiquark distributions of the physical @xmath0 comes from the different parametrization of the @xmath90 which only affects @xmath116 .",
    "there is also a change in @xmath99 due to the more realistic @xmath87 quark distributions for the @xmath59 and the @xmath107 .",
    "the splitting @xmath117 is nearly negligible . hence taking into account",
    "the larger s quark mass does not noticeably change our results for @xmath2 and the difference @xmath118 from those using su(3 ) parameters .",
    "however , the valence quark distributions in the physical @xmath0 do change .",
    "we first test our model for the measured sea quark distributions in the proton .",
    "we show both @xmath119 and @xmath2 in our model with no @xmath120 and no mesons more massive than the pion in figs . 1 and 2 .",
    "the comparison with the e866 data shows that @xmath119 agrees reasonably with experiment , but that the ratio @xmath2 does not turn over towards 1 at higher value of @xmath5 with the parameterization of the bare sea used by holtmann@xcite .",
    "this problem is also found for other meson cloud and chiral models , as has been recently noted by peng et al.@xcite .",
    "however , we find that the ratio does turn over ( although not sufficiently fast ) for @xmath121 given by eq . 22 .",
    "it is true that the inclusion of the @xmath120 would help , but we believe that the splitting of the gluon into @xmath122 pairs is the dominant cause of the return of the ratio @xmath123 towards unity at @xmath124 .",
    "we believe that a parameterization for @xmath79 can be found that is consistent with the gluonic data and with the ratio @xmath2 . for a further discussion , see also @xcite .",
    "+ the four splitting functions for the @xmath0 are shown in fig .",
    "3 ; it is clear that the contribution from the @xmath125 state is very small . in fig .",
    "4 we show the calculated valence quark momentum distributions . the s quark distribution peaks at a slightly higher value of @xmath5 than that of the @xmath88 quark momentum distribution due to its larger mass . the momentum distribution of the sea quarks is shown in figs .",
    "we show the distributions for both the holtmann @xcite and the gluonic @xcite bare @xmath0 distributions .",
    "the @xmath126 and @xmath127 distributions are slightly different , but the difference is so small that we do not attempt to show it .",
    "the difference @xmath128 shown in fig .",
    "8 is , of course , independent of the bare @xmath0 s quark distribution , since it is due to gluon splitting .",
    "it is interesting to see in fig .",
    "9 how much @xmath129 distribution depends on that of the bare sea . in both cases considered the ratio is larger than @xmath130 in the proton . for the holtmann @xcite bare quark distribution @xmath131 increases with increasing @xmath5 and does not turn over . for the gluonic distribution , on the other hand , @xmath132 does not rise half as high and approaches 1 as @xmath133 .",
    "we show @xmath134 in fig .",
    "10 and compare @xmath131 to @xmath135 in fig . 11 . in the latter figure",
    "we note that @xmath136 falls below 1 for the gluonic - like distribution at high @xmath5 , but the distribution functions are very small here .",
    "+ we also tested the influence of the cut - off parameter @xmath54 on our results .",
    "since a higher cut - off primarily makes the amplitudes of the splitting functions larger but does not change their shape very much , the sea quarks will carry more of the @xmath0 momentum while the momentum fraction carried by the valence s quarks stays the same and that of the valence u quarks gets smaller .",
    "the ratio @xmath137 gets smaller and the difference @xmath138 gets larger with growing @xmath54 [ at all x ] .",
    "in conclusion , we have used the meson cloud model to calculate the valence and sea quark distributions in the @xmath0 . the same model can of course",
    "be used to calculate the valence and sea quark distributions in the @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "now that quark distributions in the proton have been well - determined , it is possible to use @xmath0 and @xmath140 beams and inclusive drell - yan reactions on protons , alone , to obtain similar information for the hyperons .",
    "nuclear binding corrections for deuterium targets are thereby avoided .",
    "for instance if @xmath141 is large and @xmath142 is small , the measurement @xmath143 is sensitive to @xmath119 in the @xmath0 .",
