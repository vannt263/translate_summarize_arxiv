    "for all these purposes today s complex and bulky optical - clock experimental setups need to be re - engineered into more compact and power efficient systems , ensuring at the same time a high stability and accuracy , but also high operation reliability in critical environments @xcite , such as application in the field or even satellites .",
    "a first step in the engineering challenge leading to space based optical clocks is to demonstrate transportable clocks .",
