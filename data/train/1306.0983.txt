    "absorption of the 21-cm electron spin - flip transition of neutral hydrogen ( ) is a powerful probe of the reservoir of star - forming material in the early universe . at high redshift",
    ", 21-cm absorption can provide important insight into star formation rates and galaxy evolution at a time when chemical abundances were markedly different to the present day .",
    "furthermore , in combination with other absorbing species ,  21-cm can provide measurements of the fundamental constants at large look - back times ( @xcite and references therein ) . in five cases ,",
    "oh 18-cm absorption has been found coincident with the  @xcite and the hydroxyl radical is of particular interest for measurement of the constants since it allows highly sensitive measurements from a single absorbing species @xcite .    however , the detection of either transition at @xmath4 is a rare occurrence . for  21-cm ,",
    "80 systems have been detected and , despite much searching ( @xcite and references therein ) , the detection of oh 18-cm is rarer yet with only the aforementioned five detections to date .",
    "@xcite have shown that the molecular fraction in the known molecular absorbers is correlated with the optical  near - infrared colour , thus indicating that their colours are due to the presence of dust required to shield the molecular gas from the ambient uv field . therefore , selecting objects for which an optical redshift is available selects against those with a high molecular fraction , making the detection of molecular absorbers difficult .    hence , in an attempt to increase the number of redshifted detections of both species , we have performed full spectral scans with the green bank telescope ( gbt ) toward five highly reddened ( optical  near - infrared colours of @xmath5 ) radio - loud objects ( tanna et al .",
    ", in prep . ) . for the reddest ( @xmath6 ) of the targets , the @xmath7 quasar mgj0414 + 0534 ( 4c+05.19 ) , three 21-cm absorption systems have already been detected ( see table  [ abs ] ) . in this letter we report the detection of a further absorber at a redshift of @xmath8 , as well as candidate system at @xmath9",
    "we have now completed the analysis of the data along the entire redshift space towards mgj0414 + 0534 ( see @xcite for details ) , upon which we find a further two possible absorption profiles , near 926 mhz and 1061 mhz .",
    "the absorption feature close to 926 mhz was the least subject to radio frequency interference ( rfi ) , which appears as narrow lines and amplitude fluctuations .",
    "these can be seen in fig .",
    "[ 4th - stacked ] ( top ) , which essentially constitutes a low - resolution time - lapse series of the individual 146.3 sec exposure scans .",
    ", the spectrum is shown at the observed spectral resolution of 3.4  and a first order polynomial removed from the bandpass , with the best fit voigt profile overlain .",
    "the lower panel shows the standard deviation of each channel from the mean across all individual scans . ]    in the final averaged spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ 4th - stacked ] , bottom ) , a persistent absorption feature was apparent , which maintains consistency throughout the observations , with gbt rfi monitoring indicating that this part of the band is predominantly clear of interference . there remains , however , a two channel wide spike redshifted by @xmath10 from the peak of the profile .",
    "the rfi nature of this is confirmed in spectral animations of contiguous 5 sec integrations , where like the other rfi features in the band , the spike is seen to fluctuate between its minimum and maximum amplitudes on time - scales of a minute . for the sake of transparency",
    ", we do not flag the spike out of final averaged spectrum , although we blank and interpolate over the affected channels for the measurements described in sect .",
    "[ hi4 ] . given the profile shape mhz . ] and its strength , we believe that the feature must arise from 21-cm absorption at @xmath11 .    close to 1061 mhz ,",
    "the dominant rfi was apparent as `` packets '' , one of which impinges on one side of a possible absorption feature .",
    "rfi monitoring indicates that these packets ( spaced @xmath121 mhz apart ) are due to aircraft radar and much of the data are heavily affected .    , but for the feature near 1061 mhz . ]    again , through the animation of contiguous 5 sec integrations , the packets behave in a similar fashion to the rfi spikes close to 925 mhz , displaying time dependent fluctuations .",
    "flagging the data most strongly affected leaves approximately one third of the scans , allowing us to retain some data at all frequencies , particularly on the blue - shifted side of the line . while the rfi packets are still apparent in the final averaged spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ 5th - stacked ] , bottom ) , it is clear that the absorption feature at 1061 mhz maintains a stable , deep profile shape over the course of the observations ( even beneath the rfi ) .",
    "furthermore , the packets vary regularly in time , flipping between positive , negative and zero fluxes , whereas the absorption profile is consistent and has an identical appearance in two different ifs ( 0.91.1 ghz and 1.051.25 ghz ) .",
    "the stability of the putative line is confirmed in the standard deviation spectrum , which identifies time varying features , where the peak is not coincident with the most variable channels ( fig .",
    "[ 5th - stacked ] , bottom ) . however , given that the near - by rfi is not restricted to one or two channels , this feature requires confirmation from an independent observation .",
    "the mean frequency of the first feature ( fig . [ 4th - stacked ] ) is @xmath13 mhz , which for  21-cm gives , from the flagged data , a flux averaged mean redshift of @xmath14 , cf .",
    "the peak redshift of @xmath15 , obtained from the deepest channel in the peak of the profile .",
    "there is a decrease in the bandpass response below 950 mhz , giving a continuum flux of @xmath16 jy , cf .",
    "the 2.3 jy seen over the rest of the band , which yields an observed peak optical depth of @xmath17 . unlike the vast majority of redshifted 21-cm absorption , this peak depth means that the optically thin approximation can not be applied ( where @xmath18 ) , i.e. @xmath19 . since , by definition , the covering factor @xmath20 , the peak optical depth is then @xmath21 and the velocity integrated optical depth @xmath22 .",
    "this gives a column density of @xmath23 , where @xmath24 [ k ] is the mean harmonic spin temperature of the gas .",
    "the mean frequency of the second feature ( fig .",
    "[ 5th - stacked ] ) is @xmath25 mhz , which for  21-cm gives a redshift of @xmath26 , cf .",
    "the peak redshift of @xmath27 .",
    "the peak depth of the line is @xmath28 jy and the continuum flux is @xmath29 jy , giving a peak @xmath30 .",
    "again , the optically thin approximation is not applicable and so @xmath31 , giving @xmath32  and @xmath33 .",
    "if genuine , this would be the second deepest redshifted 21-cm feature yet found at @xmath34 towards ao0235 + 164 @xcite .",
    "] , although given our concerns about its authenticity ( sect .  [ oadr ] )",
    "this requires confirmation .",
    "we note there are apparent similarities in the shapes of the two absorption profiles as a function of velocity , although , in addition to different depths , the widths exhibit a slight difference , with the 926 mhz profile having a full - width half maximum of fwhm@xmath35 , cf .",
    "fwhm@xmath36  at 1061 mhz .",
    "since the profile shapes are not consistent in frequency space , we believe it unlikely that these are due to an instrumental artifact , which lends some weight to the reality of the 1061 mhz feature .",
    "the shape of each line has much broader wings than those produced by a single gaussian profile and are best fit by a single voigt profile , which we interpret as the effect of pressure broadening convolved with the velocity dispersion of the gas .",
    "lastly , in table [ abs ] we list the derived column densities together with the other 21-cm absorbers thus far found towards j0414 + 0534 .    [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     notes : @xmath37oh limit from @xcite , @xmath38if genuine 21-cm absorption ( sect .",

    "that is , all of the absorbers so far found along the sight - line towards j0414 + 0534 are likely to be associated with gas - rich galaxies .",
    "confirmation of 21-cm detections can be done through optical imaging and spectroscopy , either by finding absorption lines in the quasar spectrum at matching redshifts or by identifying the absorbing galaxy . detecting common optical absorption lines , such as mgii , from these systems",
    "is made difficult by the extremely red colour of the quasar s optical spectrum : for @xmath41 and @xmath42 the mgii doublet would appear at 429  nm and 375  nm respectively , where the quasar flux is very low @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite detect strong 21-cm absorption in the host galaxy and any associated lyman-@xmath3 absorption ( centred on 442.6  nm at @xmath2 ) would likely conceal the near - by @xmath43 mgii line .",
    "there is evidence from the spectrum of @xcite of the @xmath44 nai doublet at @xmath42 .",
    "this identification is made difficult by both the low - resolution of the published spectrum and the presence of the nearby caii h+k line from the lensing galaxy at @xmath45 .",
    "it is , however , suggestive of a galaxy at the redshift of the 1061 mhz putative detection . the same nai line at @xmath11 coincides with strong sky - line subtraction residuals in the @xcite spectrum .",
    "identifying the corresponding absorbing galaxy is also difficult .",
    "no published spectroscopy exists of neighbouring field galaxies , although @xcite presented long - slit spectroscopy of the lensing galaxy , taken with the slit placed across `` object x '' , the closest field galaxy .",
    "@xcite identified two peaks in the low - resolution spectrum at the wavelengths expected for [ oiii ] at z=0.3789 .",

    "the detection of at least one new absorber now gives at least three intervening systems along the sight - line to j0414 + 0534 ( table [ abs ] ) .",
    "all of these systems are likely to be dlas ( sect .",

    "the total number of sight - lines probed for a given redshift value is in excess of 15000 for much of this range ( see fig . 2 of @xcite ) , peaking at 22000",

    "zero sight - lines with at least two dla strength absorbers out of @xmath62 sight - lines means that , with at least three distinct dlas at @xmath63 , the sight - line towards j0414 + 0534 is unprecedented .",

    "there is , however , no evidence of oh absorption in either case ( fig .",
    "[ oh - spectra ] ) .    in table [ abs ] we list the best oh column density limits for these systems , together with those of the previous searches .",
    "based on the optical  near - infrared colour of @xmath65 , we expect molecular fractions of close to unity @xcite or @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "this is ruled out for all of the known 21-cm absorbers , except perhaps that associated with the host which has the weakest limit .",
    "even so , given that only 46% of the band is not completely ruined by rfi ( tanna et al .",
    ", in prep . )",
    ", the presence of significant columns of molecular gas elsewhere along this sight - line can not be ruled out .",
    "given that there is no evidence of molecular absorption coincident with the redshifts of the 21-cm absorbers , we revisit the possibility that the reddening is due to dust associated with the intervening atomic gas @xcite .",
    "from all of the published associated @xmath67 absorption searches , @xcite found a @xmath68 correlation between the 21-cm line strength and the @xmath69 colour . unlike the molecular line strength correlation @xcite , this exhibits considerate scatter ,",
    "although it does comprise many more data points and is quite fragile , with the correlation quickly disappearing as various sub - samples are removed .",
    "another point of note was that the 21-cm line strength of the associated ( @xmath7 ) absorber was weaker than expected , based upon the trend defined by the other points ( fig .",

    "the filled circles are the 21-cm detections and the unfilled circles the non - detections .",
    "the filled star shows the line strength for the @xmath70 absorber associated with the host of j0414 + 0534 and the hollow stars the total of the line strengths for the four robust detections , and including the putative @xmath71 feature ( table [ abs ] ) . ]    replacing this with the total column density so far observed along this sight - line ( the unfilled stars in the figure ) and @xmath72 , in order to maintain consistency with the other measurements .",
    "] , moves the line strength closer to the expected trend and , as before , including the limits via the asurv survival analysis package @xcite , the total column density increases the significance of the correlation to @xmath73 for four absorbers and @xmath74 including the putative fifth absorber .",
    "this may be further evidence of dust associated with the dense atomic gas in the intervening systems being the cause of the extremely red colour of this object , although the individual contributions of these absorbers toward the total reddening of the quasar light can not , as yet , be established .",
    "note also , that most of the other sources have only been searched for 21-cm close to the host redshift ( i.e. for associated absorption ) .",
    "therefore , strictly speaking , these too represent lower limits , since further absorption systems along their sight - lines have not been ruled out .",
    "furthermore , as for the molecular gas , substantial atomic absorption may exist in this sight - line at redshifts corresponding to rfi affected frequencies . in either case , the large number of 21-cm absorbers detected over the useful fraction of the band , in conjunction with the apparent obscuration of the source , may have far reaching implications for the number of gas - rich galaxies missed by optical surveys .",
    "we have now completed the analysis of a full - band decimetre wave spectral scan towards the very red ( @xmath65 ) quasar mgj0414 + 0534 . from the @xmath75% of the band",
    "not completely ruined by rfi , we have found three ( possibly four ) strong intervening absorbers , in addition to the previously detected absorption in the host galaxy at @xmath2 @xcite . at a total of four ( or five ) , this represents a new record in the number of 21-cm absorbers found along a single sight - line , the previous being a total of two systems towards pks1830211 @xcite , which has @xmath76 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the new detections occur at redshifts of @xmath64 and @xmath0 , each being very strong absorbers with column densities of @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively .",
    "this qualifies both as damped lyman-@xmath3 absorption systems for a paltry @xmath79  k ( an order of magnitude lower than the lowest yet found , @xcite ) .",
    "however , given the rfi in the spectrum at 1061 mhz , the @xmath80 feature requires confirmation .    despite the large column densities ,",
    "no oh absorption was found in either the main or satellite 18-cm lines at these redshifts , although the very red colour of the background source suggests large molecular fractions somewhere along the sight - line @xcite . summing the observed  column densities",
    "does strengthen the atomic gas abundance/@xmath69 colour correlation @xcite , although this remains fairly scattered .",
    "therefore , dense molecular gas at an rfi affected redshift and/or the possibility that j0414 + 0534 is intrinsically red can not be ruled out .",
