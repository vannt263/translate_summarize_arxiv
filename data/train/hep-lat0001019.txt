    "there are different starting points to formulate a lattice theory with exact chiral symmetry , but all of them must obey the ginsparg - wilson condition @xcite : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the lattice spacing , @xmath2 is the lattice dirac operator and @xmath3 is a local operator and trivial in the dirac space .",
    "a candidate is the overlap operator of neuberger @xcite : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a shift parameter in the range @xmath6 , which i have fixed at one and @xmath7 is the wilson - dirac operator , @xmath8\\ ] ] and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the nearest - neighbor forward and backward difference operators , which are covariant , i.e. the shift operators pick up a unitary 3 by 3 matrix with determinant one . these small matrices are associated with the links of the lattice and are oriented positively .",
    "a set of such matrices forms a `` configuration '' .",
    "@xmath11 are 4 by 4 matrices related to the spin of the particle . therefore ,",
    "if there are @xmath12 lattice points , the matrix is of order @xmath13 .",
    "a restive symmetry of the matrix @xmath14 that comes from the continuum is the so called @xmath15 which is the hermiticity of the @xmath16 operator .",
    "the computation of the inverse square root of a matrix is reviewed in @xcite . in the context of lattice qcd",
    "there are several sparse matrix methods , which are developed recently @xcite .",
    "i will focus here on a lanczos method similar to @xcite . for a more general case of functions of matrices",
    "i refer to the talk of h. van der vorst , and for a chebyshev method i refer to the talk of k. jansen , both included in these proceedings .",
    "the lanczos iteration is known to approximate the spectrum of the underlying matrix in an optimal way and , in particular , it can be used to solve linear systems @xcite .",
    "let @xmath17 $ ] be the set of orthonormal vectors , such that @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a tridiagonal and symmetric matrix , @xmath20 is an arbitrary vector , and @xmath21 a real and positive constant .",
    "@xmath22 denotes the unit vector with @xmath23 elements in the direction @xmath24 .    by writing down the above decomposition in terms of the vectors @xmath25 and",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath19 , i arrive at a three term recurrence that allows to compute these vectors in increasing order , starting from the vector @xmath26 .",
    "this is the @xmath27 : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a tolerance which serves as a stopping condition .",
    "the lanczos algorithm constructs a basis for the krylov subspace @xcite : @xmath30 if the algorithm stops after @xmath23 steps , one says that the associated krylov subspace is invariant .    in the floating point arithmetic",
    ", there is a danger that once the lanczos algorithm ( polynomial ) has approximated well some part of the spectrum , the iteration reproduces vectors which are rich in that direction @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the orthogonality of the lanczos vectors is spoiled with an immediate impact on the history of the iteration : if the algorithm would stop after @xmath23 steps in exact arithmetic , in the presence of round off errors the loss of orthogonality would keep the algorithm going on .",
    "here i will use this algorithm to solve linear systems , where the loss of orthogonality will not play a role in the sense that i will use a different stopping condition .",
    "i ask the solution in the form @xmath32 by projecting the original system on to the krylov subspace i get : @xmath33 by construction , i have @xmath34 substituting @xmath35 and using ( [ hq_qt ] ) , my task is now to solve the system @xmath36 therefore the solution is given by @xmath37 this way using the lanczos iteration one reduces the size of the matrix to be inverted .",
    "moreover , since @xmath19 is tridiagonal , one can compute @xmath38 by short recurences .",
    "if i define : @xmath39 where @xmath40 , it is easy to show that @xmath41 therefore the solution can be updated recursively and i have the following _",
    "algorithm1 for solving the system @xmath31 : _ @xmath42",
    "now i would like to compute @xmath44 and still use the lanczos algorithm . in order to do so",
    "i make the following observations :    let @xmath45 be expressed by a matrix - valued function , for example the integral formula @xcite : @xmath46 from the previous section , i use the lanczos algorithm to compute @xmath47 it is easy to show that the lanczos algorithm is shift - invariant .",
    "i.e. if the matrix @xmath48 is shifted by a constant say , @xmath49 , the lanczos vectors remain invariant .",
    "moreover , the corresponding lanczos matrix is shifted by the same amount .",
    "this property allows one to solve the system @xmath50 by using the same lanczos iteration as before .",
    "since the matrix @xmath51 is better conditioned than @xmath48 , it can be concluded that once the original system is solved , the shifted one is solved too .",
    "therefore i have : @xmath52 using the above integral formula and puting everything together , i get : @xmath53 there are some remarks to be made here :    \\a ) as before , by applying the lanczos iteration on @xmath48 , the problem of computing @xmath54 reduces to the problem of computing @xmath55 which is typically a much smaller problem than the original one .",
    "but since @xmath56 is full , @xmath38 can not be computed by short recurences .",
    "it can be computed for example by using the full decomposition of @xmath19 in its eigenvalues and eigenvectors ; in fact this is the method i have employed too , for its compactness and the small overhead for moderate @xmath23 .",
    "\\b ) the method is not optimal , as it would have been , if one would have applied it directly for the matrix @xmath57 . by using @xmath48",
    "the condition is squared , and one looses a factor of two compared to the theoretical case !",
    "\\c ) from the derivation above , it can be concluded that the system @xmath43 is solved at the same time as the system @xmath31 .",
    "\\d ) to implement the result ( [ result ] ) , i first construct the lanczos matrix and then compute @xmath58 to compute @xmath35 , i repeat the lanczos iteration .",
    "i save the scalar products , though it is not necessary .    therefore i have the following _",

    "@xmath59 where by @xmath60 i denote a vector with zero entries and @xmath61 the matrices of the egienvectors and eigenvalues of @xmath19 .",
    "note that there are only four large vectors necessary to store : @xmath62 .",
    "i propose a simple test : i solve the system @xmath31 by applying twice the @xmath63 , i.e. i solve the linear systems @xmath64 in the above order . for each approximation @xmath65 , i compute the residual vector @xmath66 the method is tested for a su(3 ) configuration at @xmath67 on a @xmath68 lattice , corresponding to an order @xmath69 complex matrix @xmath14 .    in fig.1",
    "i show the norm of the residual vector decreasing monotonically .",
    "the stagnation of @xmath70 for small values of @xmath29 may come from the accumulation of round off error in the @xmath71-bit precision arithmetic used here .",

    "having computed the operator , one can invert it by applying iterative methods based on the the lanczos algorithm .",
    "since the operator @xmath2 is normal , it turns out that the conjugate residual ( cr ) algorithm is the optimal one @xcite .    in fig .",
    "2 i show the converegence history of cr on @xmath72 small @xmath73 lattices at @xmath74 .",
    "the large number of multiplications with @xmath75 suggests that the inversion of the neuberger operator is a difficult task and may bring the complexity of quenched simulations in lattice qcd to the same order of magnitude to dynamical simulations with wilson fermions .",
    "therefore , other ideas are needed .",
    "the essential point is the large number of small eigenvalues of @xmath14 that make the computation of @xmath2 time consuming .",
    "therefore , one may try to project out these modes and invert them directly @xcite .",
    "also , one may try @xmath76dimensional implementations of the neuberger operator , such that its condition improves @xcite .",
    "i have tried also to reformulate the theory in 5 dimensions by using the corresponding approximate inversion as a coarse grid solution in a multigrid scheme @xcite .",
    "the scheme is tested and the results are shown in fig .",
    "2 , where the multigrid pattern of the residual norm is clear . the gain with respect to cr is about a factor @xmath77 .    note that to invert the `` big '' matrix i have used the bicgstab2 algorithm @xcite which is almost optimal in most of the cases for the non - normal matrices as its is the matrix @xmath78 @xcite .",
