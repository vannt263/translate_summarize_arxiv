    "a strongly charged target tends to take off the electrostatic stress , decreasing the electric field below its threshold value through ion expulsion .",

    "the surface charge reaches almost 60% , an unexpected value for silicon irradiated by low laser fluence .",
    "the densities of the electrons and holes are presented in fig .",
    "considerable charging takes place in a surface zone of order of 2 nm wide ( @xmath73 atomic monolayers ) .",
    "it is generally agreed that , because of efficient auger recombination , a silicon target can not be ionized to a high ionization degree at moderate laser fluences .",
    "that is a major argument against the coulomb explosion mechanism .",
    "our modeling shows that a thin surface layer of the target reaches a high ionization degree , but therewith this layer occurs to be strongly depleted of electrons .",
    "extremely high density of positive charge is gained in a few monolayers , implying the strong repulsion force between the ions .",
    "first of all , adatoms , which have lower binding with surface , have to be ejected from the surface , giving way to the generation of new adatoms .",
    "the process of ion expulsion will take place till all the layer of high positive charge is exploded or till the macroscopic electric field is reduced below the threshold value .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] illustrates that , at 0.2 j / cm@xmath3 , the macroscopic electric field exceeds the threshold value , as it was predicted analytically .",
    "the values of charging and the electric field in two external monolayers are so high , that their electrostatic explosion is inevitable .",
    "let us consider the origin of high surface charging of a silicon target in detail .",
    "what is happening when a target subjected to laser irradiation loses the electrons due to photoemission ?",
    "the dielectric breakdown takes place within a skin layer with an exponential decay toward the target depth .",
    "because of photoemission , the target quasi - neutrality is broken . according to the gauss law , the target , which starts to behave as a metal , aspires to accumulate the excess positive charge in its surface .",
    "the electric field in this thin surface layer is `` negative '' ( directed to vacuum ) that means that the non - emitted electrons are dragged toward the target depth to a region with a lower field .",
    "thus , the following scenario of the electrostatic mechanism for both ion desorption and ablation from the semiconductor targets ( that may be a case also for dielectrics ) can be proposed step by step : ( i ) target material breakdown and photoemission under laser irradiation ; ( ii ) generation of the electric field which drags the electrons away from the surface layer ; ( iii ) continuing surface ionization together with suppression of auger recombination ; ( iv ) as a result , ionization degree up to 100% in a thin surface layer ; ( v ) electrostatic disintegration of this layer .",
    "_ the most important consequence is that , in the charged outer layer , one - photon ionization is continuing during the laser pulse , whereas the auger recombination is strongly suppressed because of lack of electrons . _",
    "mechanisms of desorption and ablation of silicon under irradiation by the nanosecond laser pulses in a wide range of laser fluences have been studied both experimentally and theoretically . at low laser fluence",
    "the desorption flux is mostly composed of high - energy ions with a narrow energy distribution that points to a non - thermal mechanism of their generation . theoretical analysis has attributed the high - energetic ions to a strong electric field generated in an exterior target layer due to photoemission that causes coulomb explosion .",
    "more sophisticated two - temperature modeling , which takes into account electronic ion emission and the aspects of thermal vaporization , is under the progress ."
