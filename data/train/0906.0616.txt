    "yet this major galactic region is unstudied .",
    "suffering heavy extinction in this direction in the galactic plane , there is no known optical counterpart to ctb  102 .",
    "the purpose of this study is to determine the basic properties of ctb  102 , mainly how large in physical size it is , and how it influences its galactic environment . in this paper",
    "we present new rrl observations towards ctb  102 .",
    "rrl observations allow direct velocity measurements , and along with continuum observations will tell us the density and temperature of any gas in the beam at or near thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "rrl observations towards ctb  102 were performed with the 100-m nrao green bank telescope ( gbt ) during 6 nights in 2006 , july 31 , august 2 - 4 , 15 & 17 .",
    "twelve pointings were observed around the ctb  102 complex .",
    "these telescope pointings are illustrated in figures  [ pointings ] and [ velocities ] .",
    "positions and total integration times for the chosen observations are given in table  [ obs - tbl ] , the observations themselves were divided into 600  s scans .",
    "rrls observed were h103@xmath3 through h110@xmath3 .",
    "a 50 mhz bandwidth receiver was used to allow the eight recombination lines to be simultaneously observed in the high end of the @xmath11-band ( @xmath12 ghz ) .",
    "both polarizations were admitted , and the spectrum consists of 4096 channels ( @xmath13 km s@xmath8 per channel ) .",
    "system temperatures ranged from 19 to 26  k , depending mainly on the elevation of the source .",
    "average system temperatures for each observation are given in table  [ obs - tbl ] .",
    "as a check of the system s ability to record rrl emission , the bright `` head '' of ctb  102 at @xmath14 , hereafter ctb102p , was observed for 600  s at the beginning of each session .",
    "none of the eight 50  mhz bands were seriously affected by radio frequency interference .",
    "frequency - switched scans in each linear polarization ( yy , xx ) were folded individually ; since frequency - switching was done in - band ( @xmath1512.5  mhz ) , we doubled our effective integration time .",
    "each 600  s scan contains 16 spectra . to assure that no line structure ( e.g. very extended wings from outflows ) is removed , velocities forbidden by galactic rotation ( typically @xmath16  km s@xmath17  km s@xmath8 and @xmath18  km s@xmath19  km s@xmath8 ) defines a range of baseline velocities . for each of the 16 spectra in every scan",
    ", a baseline was determined using a fourth - order polynomial fitted to the range of baseline velocities .",
    "this fitted baseline was then subtracted from every spectrum in each scan .",
    "after baseline subtraction , the spectra in the individual scans are combined ( for every velocity channel , intensity values are summed up and then divided by the number of scans ) to create averaged spectra , one for each line and polarization . at this point in the reduction process , there are 16 spectra ( h103@xmath3 xx , h103@xmath3 yy , h104@xmath3 xx , etc . ) for every observation in table  [ obs - tbl ] .",
    "these averaged spectra were regridded to a common channel width ( 0.67  km s@xmath8 ) and smoothed to a common velocity resolution ( 1.5015  km s@xmath8 ) .",
    "typically 4 - 10 of these averaged spectra do not show residual wavy baselines in regions of no rrl signal .",
    "the only exception is h110@xmath3 ( polarization xx ) , which shows a very wide `` bump '' in the spectrum centered around @xmath20  km s@xmath8 , extending into the region of the rrl signal .",
    "this line and polarization is completely excluded from the analysis . to reduce noise , composite spectra , one for each filament , are made by combining the averaged spectra that do not show residual wavy baselines .",
    "the composite spectra typically have a noise level of @xmath21  mk ( antenna temperature ) .    since rrls are expected to be quite wide ( 25 - 30   km s@xmath8 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a spectral resolution of 1.5  km s@xmath8 is unnecessarily fine .",
    "a higher s / n can be achieved without loss of information by moderate smoothing of the composite spectra , although too much will add an artificial width to spectral lines present .",
    "we conservatively choose a resolution of 3.0  km s@xmath8 .",
    "to our final smoothed composite spectra , gaussians are fit to obtain spectral line parameters : line amplitude ( @xmath22 ) , central velocity ( @xmath23 ) and fwhm ( @xmath24 ) . smoothed spectra and the gaussian fits",

    "figure  [ velocities ] displays the observed velocities of the filaments / objects , overlayed on a cgps 1.42 ghz continuum image .",
    "this study finds that the bright radio source ctb102p has a velocity of @xmath27 km  s@xmath8 , which is 1.7 km  s@xmath8 less than the value in @xcite .",
    "the difference is probably due to the difference in pointing position , as well as the difference in telescope beam size between the studies .",
    "the velocity of ctb102p is hereafter referred to as @xmath28 .",
    "one purpose of this study is to find out the size of ctb  102 , i.e. are the filaments and objects we see around ctb  102 at the same distance ?",
    "the velocity gradient ( for a flat rotation curve with @xmath29 kpc and @xmath30 km  s@xmath8 ) in this part of the galaxy is @xmath31 km s@xmath8 kpc@xmath8 .",
    "looking at the last column of table  [ par - tbl ] , most filaments and objects have a @xmath32 km  s@xmath8 , so it seems likely that the ctb  102 complex and objects kr  4 , kr  6 and nrao  652 are in the same part of the galaxy .",
    "in contrast , wb  43 ( @xmath33  km s@xmath8 ) is clearly a local region , and in no way connected to the ctb  102 complex ( figure  [ spectra ] ) .",
    "filament 2 is another possible unrelated object ( see sec  [ disc ] ) , its velocity ( @xmath34  km s@xmath8 ) deviates the most from the velocity of ctb102p , @xmath35 km  s@xmath8 , and is @xmath31 km s@xmath8 less than any other velocity observed in this study .",
    "computing the average absolute difference for all observations ( except wb  43 ) yields a result of 6.6 km  s@xmath8 , but excluding filament 2 from the average , the value drops to 4.3 km  s@xmath8 .",
    "the majority of fwhms in this study fall between 20  km s@xmath8 and 26  km s@xmath8 , which is typical for dense regions @xcite .",
    "the line width of a rrl depends on mainly two things , thermal motion , which is described by the electron temperature ( @xmath36 ) , and microturbulence .",
    "both of these processes produce gaussian profile shapes , so a doppler temperature ( @xmath37 ) , which provides an upper limit to the true electron temperature , can be adopted as follows @xcite : @xmath38 where @xmath24 is the observed fwhm in km  s@xmath8 from table  [ par - tbl ] , corrected for the spectral resolution of 3 km  s@xmath8 .    the lte electron temperature can be calculated using the line to continuum brightness ratio : @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 @xcite . the continuum brightness temperature @xmath42 is obtained by convolving the cgps 1.42 ghz mosaic to the @xmath43 resolution of the gbt .",
    "the background is estimated individually for each filament ( typical background estimate uncertainty @xmath44 k ) and the background is subtracted from the average brightness temperature within a @xmath43 circle centered on the telescope pointing . assuming temperature follows the power law @xmath45 the resulting @xmath42 is scaled using the average frequency of the observed rrls ( 5.46 ghz ) .",
    "the parameters derived in this way for each filament / object are in table  [ der - tbl ] .",
    "the @xmath36 is quite sensitive to the estimated background temperature , especially when the peak brightness temperature is barely above the background .",
    "note that @xmath46 within the @xmath47 uncertainty in all cases .",
    "@xmath37 provides a useful upper limit to @xmath36 in case the uncertainty in @xmath36 is large .",
    "these derived parameters for the ionized gas gives an average lte electron temperature of @xmath48 k. this value falls within the typical range of electron temperatures for regions .",
    "we note the fwhm of ctb102p determined in this study , @xmath49  km s@xmath8 , is 4.6  km s@xmath8 less than the value for @xmath24 in @xcite .",
    "again , the difference is probably due to the difference in beam size and pointing position .",
    "with the majority of the filaments velocities found to be very similar to that of the central body , the whole ctb  102 complex subtends about one to two degrees of sky .",
    "its distance would be able to tell us how far across its influence extends across the outer disk . here",
    "we provide the first ever distance estimate for this region .    to begin with ,",
    "figure [ lbvhi ] shows a latitude - velocity slice in the direction @xmath50 , taken from the 26-meter telescope survey of galactic plane @xcite .",
    "extensive intermediate velocity ( @xmath51  km  s@xmath8 ) is seen extending from @xmath52 in latitude .",
    "the beyond @xmath53  km  s@xmath8 appears split into three blended concentrations .",
    "the lower - latitude concentration at @xmath54 and @xmath55  km  s@xmath8 blended together with the concentration near @xmath56 at @xmath57  km  s@xmath8 are contemporarily taken together to form the perseus arm ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for example ) .",
    "the outer arm is the smaller oblong feature up at @xmath58 , @xmath59  km  s@xmath8 , which is also blended with the upper - latitude portion of the perseus arm .",
    "as seen in the top panel of figure  [ lbvhi ] , the contemporary perseus arm exhibits a very substantial tilt in latitude towards negative velocities .",
    "this is known as the `` rolling '' motion in this arm .",
    "as well , the splitting of the perseus arm into two concentrations has been explained by a spiral shock @xcite which is thought to precede the arm .",
    "however , an alternative explanation for the @xmath60 structure in the suggests that there are actually three spiral arms beyond @xmath61  km  s@xmath8 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; the perseus arm ( centered at @xmath62  km  s@xmath8 ) , the cygnus ( = outer ) arm ( @xmath63  km  s@xmath8 ) , and the `` far '' outer arm up at @xmath64 . in this 3-arm interpretation ,",
    "the perseus and cygnus arms have more reasonable moderate rolling gradients ( @xmath65  km  s@xmath8 per degree ) .",
    "the cygnus arm appears at higher latitudes than perseus since it lies further into the upwardly - warped outer galactic disk .",
    "the systemic velocity estimated for ctb  102 in ( @xmath66  km  s@xmath8 ; see sec [ disc ] ) and its latitude ( @xmath67 ) place it somewhat in the middle of the contemporary perseus arm , in an `` wall '' that connects the two brighter concentrations . in @xmath68 plots ( figure  [ lbvhi ] , top ) ,",
    "ctb  102 is situated between the two major concentrations , and in the 3-arm picture above it is not clear in which spiral arm it resides . in @xmath69 maps ( figure  [ lbvhi ] , bottom ) a `` mushroom - cap''-like feature centered on ctb  102 s coordinates ( @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72  km  s@xmath8 ) appears as a `` blister '' off of the top of the extensive arm at @xmath73 . as well , in an @xmath74 plot of @xmath75 ( figure [ lbvhi ] , center ) this cap is seen as a finger - like extension off of the cygnus arm , centered at @xmath76  km  s@xmath8 extending down to @xmath77  km  s@xmath8 .",
    "it has the appearance of either an upper - latitude extension to the perseus arm ( up to @xmath78 ) , or a blended concentration ( possibly the wall of an expanding bubble ) extending off the cygnus arm to more positive velocities .",
    "a distance to the perseus arm in this direction then forms a good estimate for at least a lower - limit distance to ctb  102 .",
    "the velocity of ctb  102 ( @xmath79  km  s@xmath8 ) indicates a rather large kinematic distance of 6.8  kpc , assuming a flat rotation curve with @xmath80  kpc , 28  km  s@xmath8  kpc@xmath8 .",
    "however , this assumes that the systemic @xmath23 derives only from the projection onto the line - of - sight of the object s galactic circular motion .",
    "being near a major spiral feature of the galaxy , ctb  102 is likely influenced by gravitational forces from the stellar component of the arm , so its velocity is likely tainted with non - circular motions such as those from the `` rolling '' motions in the arms ( velocity gradients perpendicular to the plane ) , and streaming motions from the gravitational influence of density waves .",
    "a new kinematic - based distance method that accounts for non - circular streaming motions due to a two - armed density wave has been developed by @xcite . the approach is to model the galactic distribution and rotation curve by fitting an empirical model of galactic structure and density - wave motions to the observations , rather than just assuming a purely circular model .",
    "the model assumes only two arms are present in the second quadrant , arranged as a two - armed density wave pattern .",
    "we model a direction near to @xmath81 to ensure that velocity gradients with latitude ( i.e. rolling motions , which are not accounted for in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are not included .",
    "the `` rolling '' gradient of the perseus arm observed towards ctb  102 is @xmath65  km  s@xmath8 per degree of latitude ; corrected for this latitude gradient , ctb  102 s systemic velocity is @xmath82  km  s@xmath8 .",
    "the velocity field of the best fitting model in the direction @xmath83 , @xmath84 is shown in figure  [ vfield ] . in this direction",
    "only the perseus arm is seen along the line - of - sight .",
    "the model shows the perseus arm gaseous density peak ( associated with the spiral shock ) to be 4.3  kpc distant from the sun in this direction .",
    "the velocity field is ambiguous between @xmath85  km  s@xmath8 due to the shock , so the heliocentric distance to ctb  102 ( @xmath8652  km  s@xmath8 ) is either 4.3  kpc or 5.8  kpc .    a simple line of reasoning will show that @xmath87  kpc is probably not the true distance to ctb  102 .",
    "supposing that it is , then for @xmath88 the galactocentric distance to ctb  102 is @xmath89  kpc ( for @xmath90  kpc ) , and in this direction the perseus arm shock ( which defines where the arm is ) is 9.3  kpc from the center . by assuming the arm is a logarithmic spiral with pitch angle @xmath91 , one finds the intersection of a 10.1  kpc radius circle with the shock at a current position of @xmath92 ( here @xmath93 is galactocentric azimuth , defined as zero from the galactic center to the sun and related to longitude @xmath94 by @xmath95 ; hence @xmath93 is positive in the 2@xmath96 quadrant of longitude ) .",
    "thus the stars have since migrated some @xmath97 beyond the arm ( their formation place ) to their current position @xmath98  kpc ,  @xmath99 .",
    "how long has it taken them to move this @xmath100 angular distance ?",
    "for `` flat '' circular rotation the angular velocity of ctb  102 is @xmath101  km  s@xmath8  kpc@xmath8 .",
    "a reasonable pattern speed for the perseus arm is @xmath102  km  s@xmath8  kpc@xmath8 , a mean between modern estimates near 20 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and older estimates near 11 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for the milky way s spiral pattern . then the time it took the system to migrate @xmath103 from the arm at angular rate @xmath104 ( the relative angular velocity with respect to the arm ) is @xmath105  myr . if the massive stars in ctb  102 formed from the compression of the shock , then by now the only ones left would be those that live longer than 75  myr , or stars of @xmath106  m@xmath107 ( b5v types , for example ) .",
    "a cluster of hundreds of such stars would be needed to power ctb  102 ( @xmath108  pc  @xmath109 ; see sec .",
    "[ central ] ) .",
    "it is highly unlikely that ctb  102 contains stars later than b5 _ only_. it is more likely that ctb  102 lies near to the arm / shock , which is 4.3  kpc distant in this direction .",
    "the uncertainty in this estimate is @xmath110 , from the variation of best - fitting models of the same direction and in models fitted to several immediately adjacent directions ( see * ? ? ?",
    "this agrees with stellar distances of the nearby optically - brilliant regions sh2 - 124 ( @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113  km  s@xmath8 , @xmath114  kpc ) and sh2 - 132 ( @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117  km  s@xmath8 , @xmath118  kpc ) , both of which are perseus arm objects ( @xmath119co/-based velocities and spectrophotometric distances to 100 sharpless objects in the second quadrant are forthcoming in * ? ? ?",
    "we note that ctb  102 and filaments may instead be kinematically associated with the cygnus spiral arm , participating in an extensive star - formation group along with region nrao  655 ( @xmath120  km  s@xmath8 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and snr 3c434.1 ( @xmath121  km  s@xmath8 ; * ? ? ?",
    "this would extend its distance estimate here by a factor of 1.6 , since the mean stellar distance to cygnus arm regions between @xmath122 ( sh2 - 121 , bfs  8 , sh2 - 128 , bfs  10 & da  568 ) is @xmath123  kpc .",

    "a polygon incorporating the region of interest is drawn by eye .",
    "the polygon s perimeter defines the background , and a twisted plane is fitted to estimate the background . the flux density with the estimated background subtracted is then used to compute the parameters @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",

    "the estimates together with the morphology of the 1.42 ghz continuum emission , suggest that the ctb  102 complex is powered by at least several late type o stars , maybe even an early type o star ( since @xmath124 is a lower limit ) .",

    "the emission is mostly concentrated along an arc extending from north of ctb  102 , wrapping around the `` edges '' of the region and extending more faintly up next to filaments 7 , 6 and 4 .",
    "these filaments ( seen in the final three velocity frames , @xmath162 to @xmath163 km s@xmath8 ) are located on the `` outside '' of the corresponding filaments and they correspond roughly in velocity to the rrl results in table  [ par - tbl ] . in the first velocity frame , @xmath166 km s@xmath8 , a filament of is spatially coincident with filament 5 ( observed @xmath167 km  s@xmath8 ) .",
    "figure  [ msx ] shows a msx a - band image ( 8.3 ) towards ctb  102 .",
    "the contour corresponds to an averaged cgps brightness temperature level of 70 k from the @xmath168 km s@xmath8 velocity frame in figure  [ h1-figure ] .",
    "the msx a - band traces pah emission from neutral material being bombarded with ultraviolet photons .",
    "figure  [ msx ] clearly shows the morphological association between structures seen in the arc discussed above , neutral material in a uv radiation field and the 1.42 ghz continuum emission .",
    "this is best demonstrated by the 8.3  emission tracing a thin filamentary structure which extends from the main arc towards ctb102p ( i.e. towards greater galactic longitude and latitude ) .",
    "this thin filament runs parallel to the bright arc seen in the 1.42 ghz continuum image ( traced by the 30 k contour in figure  [ est - plot ] ) , something which would be expected if the interpretation of a neutral shell being ionized from slightly above the bright arc is correct .",
    "can ionizing photons reach the filaments ? to reach the inside of the proposed swept up shell at filament 6 , ionizing photons have to travel an angular distance of @xmath169 from ctb102p , corresponding to @xmath170 pc at @xmath142 kpc . in the bubble scenario ,",
    "the inside of the bubble is filled with stellar wind , a hot , low density plasma .",
    "absorption in such a plasma is negligible , and the purely geometrically diluted radiation field could easily maintain a high ionization fraction in the ionized inside of the swept up shell .",
    "the same is true for the other filaments we consider part of the shell structure .",
    "for filament 2 , at a distance of @xmath171 pc from ctb102p ( @xmath172 ) , a purely geometrically diluted radiation field could maintain a high ionization fraction if the stellar wind bubble extended all the way out to filament 2 .",
    "the proposed bubble does not extend that far ( see below ) , and inserting any realistic ism between the proposed bubble and filament 2 causes significant absorption in the ism , thus leaving no photons from ctb  102 to ionize filament 2 .",
    "a simple analytical model of the development of a stellar wind bubble was given by @xcite .",
    "using the formulation in @xcite , the radius ( @xmath173 ) , shell expansion velocity ( @xmath174 ) and shell fractional thickness ( @xmath175 ) of such a region are given by : @xmath176 where @xmath177 is the energy loss rate from the star , @xmath178 is the mean molecular weight of the medium the shell is expanding into ( @xmath179 for neutral ism , @xmath180 for a fully ionized ism ) , @xmath181 is the ism density and @xmath182 is the sound speed inside the bubble .",
    "we estimate @xmath177 using a typical mass loss rate of @xmath183 m@xmath184/yr and a stellar wind velocity of @xmath185 km s@xmath8 .",
    "the sound speed is @xmath186 km s@xmath8 and the ism density is @xmath187 @xmath188 ( mean ism density , from * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "if @xmath179 it would take @xmath189 years to reach the position of filament 6 from ctb102p ( 60 pc ) , by that time the expansion velocity of the shell will be @xmath190 km s@xmath8 .",
    "the other extreme , if @xmath180 , a radius of 60 pc would be reached in @xmath191 years , with a expansion velocity at that time of @xmath192 km s@xmath8 .",
    "the expansion velocity for both scenarios is fairly insensitive to large @xmath193 , and reaches order of magnitude @xmath31 km s@xmath8 after roughly 2.5 million years .",
    "the estimated thickness of the proposed shell from the 1.42 ghz continuum image and the line data is @xmath194 , corresponding to a fractional thickness of @xmath195 .",
    "the time it takes the model shell to reach such a fractional thickness is @xmath196 years ( if @xmath179 ) or @xmath197 years ( if @xmath180 ) . if instead @xmath198 @xmath188 ( the rest of the parameters remain the same ) , time to reach 60 pc increases by a factor of @xmath199 .",
    "this suggests that if this mechanism is responsible for the observed filaments , the ism in the direction of decreasing galactic latitude can not be more than a few particles per cubic centimeter , or the timescale exceeds the main - sequence life time of the probable star(s ) .    in the basic model for the expanding swept - up shell ,",
    "the shell density would be @xcite : @xmath200 estimates of the column density test this picture where the observed filaments are due to our line of sight through the edge of the shell .",
    "the maximum path length @xmath201 looking through the edge of a uniform density spherical shell of radius @xmath173 and thickness @xmath202 would be : @xmath203 estimating the column density towards the filaments is done by integrating the cgps line data . the single channel ( width 0.82 km s@xmath8 ) rms noise is 3.3 k , corresponding to a single channel rms noise in the column density of @xmath204 @xmath109 . for filament 6 , @xmath205 pc and @xmath206 , which gives @xmath207 pc .",
    "this is on the order of the radius of the proposed bubble in this direction , so this is probably an upper limit in path length through the edge of any shell associated with ctb  102 .",
    "the column density through filament 6 is @xmath208 @xmath109 ( making the rms noise negligible ) .",
    "the uniform density needed in a shell to produce such a column density is @xmath209 @xmath188 . in the model ,",
    "the time required to reach this shell density ( with @xmath187 @xmath188 ) is @xmath210 years .",
    "given the large uncertainties of the parameters involved , in @xmath173 ( from the distance uncertainty ) , @xmath202 ( uncertainty in telling where the filaments start and end ) and column density ( mainly determining the background ) , the uncertainty in the shell density can be as large as @xmath211 .",
    "within such a large uncertainty , the model can account for observed column densities within a time frame set by the main - sequence life time of a massive star .",
    "however , it can not be ruled out that the observed filaments are higher density regions in the ism that happen to be exposed to ionizing photons from the star(s ) powering the region .",
    "even if that is the case , the medium between the filaments and the powering source would most likely be low density material with a high ionization fraction to allow for enough photons to reach the filaments .",
    "such a medium is consistent with the line data and the 1.42 ghz continuum image .",
    "the @xcite model is very basic and does not take into account multiple stellar winds nor non - uniform ism , but the estimates indicate that the bubble model is a plausible explanation of the size of ctb  102 , allowing for observed size , velocities and fractional shell thickness in a time scale of @xmath212 years . that is less than the main - sequence life time of the star(s ) that is probably powering the region .",
    "for the same reason , it is unlikely that the proposed bubble would reach all the way out to filament 2 .",
    "the overall morphology of ctb  102 indicates that the proposed region / bubble / chimney is a major feature in the perseus galactic arm , powerful enough to disrupt the ism and clear out a @xmath213 pc region .",
    "the appearance of ctb  102 in the with a cleared out region makes the ctb  102 complex comparable in size to the w4 superbubble in the perseus arm @xcite .",
    "the w4 superbubble is modeled by @xcite as expanding in a stratified atmosphere .",
    "an association of nine o - type stars ( ic 1805 ) is probably the reason for the cavity in and the ionization structure of the w4 region .",
    "ctb  102 shares similarities with w4 in large scale distribution and ionization structure .",
    "we have obtained new rrl observations of ctb  102 that show that the filamentary structure surrounding the central region is physically associated with the central region .",
    "we provide the first ever distance estimate for this region , 4.3 kpc .",
    "we argue that the best explanation for the size and appearance of the whole complex is that it is a large region combined with a wind - blown interstellar bubble / chimeny structure .",
    "msx , and 1.42 ghz observational data are consistent with this view .",
