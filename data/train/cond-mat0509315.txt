    "@xcite the band structure of na@xmath0v@xmath1o@xmath2 obtained from lda calculations is presented in fig.2 .",
    "there are 18 bands near the fermi level which have @xmath5 symmetry ( since there are 18 vanadium atoms in the unit cell ) and are separated from the other v 3d bands as well as from the 2p oxygen bands .",
    "the corresponding partial densities of states are shown in fig.3 .",

    ", one can expect that a tight - binding model with a single _ xy_-orbital per v site ( i.e. a 18-band model ) will provide a good approximation to the full band structure close to the fermi level .     and the total density of 3d states , respectively.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    for this we express the lda band structure results in terms of the low - energy model hamiltonian @xmath6 where _ i _ and _ j _ are site indexes , @xmath7 is the effective hopping integral between sites @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the operator which creates an electron with a spin @xmath11 in a state with a wannier function centered at the _ i_th atom . in order to obtain the hopping parameters @xmath7 , we have employed the projection procedure .",

    "a physically more appealing approximation is to use in the model calculation the smallest value of the crystal field splitting , which corresponds to the first excitation energy for an electron between occupied and vacant orbitals . in our case",
    "this splitting is about 1.1 ev .",
    "the calculated contributions to the total exchange interactions between vanadium atoms for @xmath20 = 1.1 ev are presented in table vi .",
    "one can see that we can qualitatively reproduce the anti- and ferromagnetic contributions to the total exchange interactions between vanadium atoms using this simple model except for bond ( v2 - 9)-(v3 - 18 ) . in order to obtain full qualitative agreement with the green function method",
    "results one should use @xmath20 = 0.8 ev , which is slightly less than the crystal - field splitting calculated by the projection procedure .",
    "we have investigated the electronic structure and the microscopic origin of the exchange interactions of na@xmath0v@xmath1o@xmath2 . based on our lda+u results",
    "we predict that the value of the energy gap in electronic excitation spectra in this system is about 1 ev . the different contributions to the exchange interaction parameters have been calculated using the first - principle green - function method proposed by a.i . lichtenstein .",
    "on the basis of the obtained results we argue that it is _ not _ correct to assume that the exchange interaction which is due to hybridization between active orbitals is a good approximation to the total exchange interaction between vanadium atoms for na@xmath0v@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "according to the present results , the main interactions are antiferromagnetic along the ring , ferromagnetic between the rings , and of the same order of magnitude .",
