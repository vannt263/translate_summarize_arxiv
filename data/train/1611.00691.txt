    "the next generation transit survey ( ngts ) is a new wide - field photometric survey for transiting exoplanets recently commissioned at eso paranal , chile .",
    "the motivation behind ngts is to understand planetary formation and evolution , as well as determining atmospheric and bulk compositions of neptune and super - earth sized exoplanets .",
    "this can only be achieved by characterising , both photometrically and spectroscopically , a large sample of such objects .",
    "the _ kepler _ survey has shown there to be an abundance of neptune sized objects in their field @xcite . however , while the results from _ kepler _ are important in terms of statistics , the mean brightness of host stars of small planets observed by _",
    "kepler _ is too faint for efficient spectroscopic follow up from the ground .",
    "the ngts project ( wheatley et al . , in prep , @xcite , @xcite ) was designed to detect this population of neptune - sized transiting exoplanets around bright ( v@xmath013 ) k and early m - type stars accessible to the eso telescopes .",
    "@xcite showed that systematic ( red ) noise is non - negligible when searching for transiting exoplanets and hence limits the detection efficiency of most ground - based surveys .",
    "initial predictions of transiting planet detection rates considered uncorrelated ( white ) noise only , overlooking the effects of red noise .",
    "pont et al .",
    "suggest that this may explain the inconsistency between transiting exoplanet detection rates compared to initial predictions .",
    "@xcite investigated the effects of systematic noise on the detection efficiency of superwasp @xcite and concluded that the survey suffered significantly from a systematic noise component in the data .",
    "the noise in superwasp was determined to be a combination of both red and white ( pink ) noise .",
    "the level of systematic noise was reduced using the sysrem detrending algorithm @xcite , but was not removed completely . as a result superwasp was forced to acquire more transits of each planet to increase the signal - to - noise ratio of their detections .    in order to meet the scientific goals of the ngts project it is crucial we understand the type of noise in an ngts - like system and identify any possible sources of systematic noise .",
    "a prototype telescope for ngts ( hereafter ngts - p ) was constructed at queen s university belfast in the winter of 2008 and spring of 2009 .",
    "ngts - p was tested at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos ( orm ) on la palma during 2009 and 2010 , conducting several experiments to determine the technical feasibility of the proposed ngts project .",
    "the main aim of ngts - p was to determine the level of systematic noise in an ngts - like system and prove that millimagnitude photometry or better could be achieved on transit time scales using wide - field newtonian telescopes of modest apertures , coupled with scientific grade ccd cameras with deep depletion silicon .",
    "the use of deep depleted ( dd- ) ccds , with their increased quantum efficiency at red wavelengths , was proposed to increase the sensitivity of the survey to k and m - type stars .",
    "this in theory allows for the detection of smaller transiting exoplanets .",
    "also , using dd - ccds significantly reduces the effects of fringing , which plague traditional ccd imaging at redder wavelengths .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : in  [ sec : hardware ] we describe the ngts prototype telescope and control software . in ",
    "[ sec : observations ] we describe the observations and data reduction process . in ",
    "[ sec : performance ] we outline the photometric performance of the prototype and give the results from several on - sky tests . in  [",
    "sec : discussion ] we discuss the results from the prototyping phase and highlight the areas where improvement was required for ngts .",
    "finally , in  [ sec : conclusion ] we close with our conclusions from the ngts prototyping phase .",
    "ngts - p consisted of an andor technologies ikon - m 934n br dd - ccd camera ( hereafter ikon1 ) coupled to a takahashi e-180 wide - field reflecting telescope .",
    "the ccd was back illuminated with @xmath1 pixels made by e2v and had a peak quantum efficiency @xmath2% ( @xmath3 nm ) .",
    "the sensor was made from high - resistance , dd silicon which produces significantly less fringing as more near - infrared photons are captured before interfering with incoming light .",
    "the camera was cooled to @xmath4c using a five - stage peltier thermoelectric cooler resulting in a dark current of @xmath5 e@xmath6 pixel@xmath7 min@xmath7 .",
    "a readout frequency of @xmath8 mhz ( @xmath9 pixels s@xmath7 ) was chosen as a compromise between speed and noise .",
    "this camera setting gave a gain , read noise and readout time of @xmath10 e@xmath6 adu@xmath7 , @xmath11 e@xmath6 and @xmath12 seconds , respectively .",

    "peak emission wavelengths ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 & @xmath16 nm for k0 ( solid blue ) , k9 ( solid cyan ) & m4.5 ( solid green ) stars , respectively ) for these stellar classes are well matched to the sensitivity of the dd - ccds .",
    "the intensities given by planck s energy distribution equation have been scaled to @xmath8 for clarity .",
    ", width=336 ]    the takahasi e-180 is an optically fast ( @xmath17 ) newtonian telescope with an aperture and focal length of @xmath18 and @xmath19 mm , giving a field - of - view and plate scale of @xmath20 and respectively .",
    "a single fixed filter was housed in the camera - to - telescope coupling .",
    "a set of @xmath21 bandpass filters ( @xmath22 narrow , @xmath8 broadband ) were available for ngts - p . in order to characterise the camera s broadband red performance all of the tests described in ",
    "[ sec : performance ] were carried out using the pseudo-@xmath23 band filter ( @xmath24 nm , see fig [ figure : filtersqebbcurves ] , red dashed line ) .",
    "using the pseudo-@xmath23 band filter allows us to better match the spectral energy distribution of k and early m - type stars , without being unnecessarily restrictive to bluer photons .",
    "the telescope was mounted on a paramount me german equatorial mount ( gem ) and auto - guided using a separate refracting telescope and auto - guider camera .",
    "one drawback of using a gem is the requirement to flip the mount when crossing the meridian .",
    "this reverses the position of all the stars on the ccd causing additional complications when conducting precise photometry .",
    "therefore , to avoid this all of the tests described in ",
    "[ sec : performance ] were conducted on one side of the meridian only .",
    "we note that a gem was used in the prototyping phase in order to be cost effective ; such a mount was never envisaged for the full ngts facility .",
    "ngts - p was housed inside a @xmath25 ft astrohaven clamshell dome and the focus of each telescope was controlled using a robofocus absolute stepper motor .",
    "the observatory was controlled using high level scripts written in the c programming language .",
    "these scripts controlled the camera using the andor software development kit and the telescope mount via thesky6 interface from software bisque .",
    "an additional script controlled the dome and monitored the weather conditions at superwasp - n , beside which ngts - p was installed , allowing for a safe shutdown of the telescope during adverse weather conditions .",
    "observations with ngts - p were carried out remotely from sea level on la palma between september 2009 and july 2010 , collecting over @xmath26 nights of data .",
    "each night s data were reduced using the standard routines in iraf .",
    "a master bias and dark frame was constructed by median combining a minimum of @xmath27 frames .",
    "after some initial analysis it became evident that the flat fielding process was adding non - linear noise to the data , due to scattered light in the flat fields , which could not be removed via detrending ( see  [ subsec : optical ] ) .",
    "as a result the data analysed here were reduced without flat fielding .",
    "the airmass at mid - exposure was calculated using the _ setairmass _ routine in iraf and the julian date ( jd ) at the mid point of each observation was converted to both the heliocentric julian date ( hjd ) and the barycentric julian date ( bjd_tdb ) using the method of @xcite .",
    "fields for ngts - p were chosen to allow for @xmath28 hours of observations without requiring a pier flip .",
    "several test fields were observed so long as they avoided very crowded regions near the galactic plane , the moon and extremely bright stars . to characterise the noise properties of ngts - p required observing an average sample of stars , therefore the telescope was able to point semi - arbitrarily .",
    "an exposure time of @xmath29 s was typically used . with hind - sight",
    "this was too long .",
    "the exposure time for the final ngts facility has been decreased to @xmath30 s to permit photometry of brighter stars and account for the increased efficiency of the final system as well as the @xmath31% increase in telescope collecting area compared to ngts - p ( 20 cm vs 18 cm diameter ) .",
    "stars were identified in the first frame of each run using sextractor . those with peak flux @xmath32 e@xmath6 and those within @xmath33 pixels of the edge of the ccd were ignored .",
    "light curves were extracted from the series of images using the daophot package @xcite in iraf . in the first frame aperture photometry was performed on positions found by sextractor and in subsequent frames the internal centring algorithm of daophot was used to track the drift of the stars over time .",
    "the raw light curves for each night were analysed and those of variable stars or with errors from the photometry , such as skipping of the aperture to brighter adjacent sources during the centroiding process , were excluded .",
    "the remaining stars were then passed through our implementation of the sysrem detrending algorithm @xcite .",
    "below is a brief outline of the process .",
    "the sysrem detrending algorithm can remove any effect that appears linearly in a large portion of the observed light curves .",
    "it acts to minimise the global expression :    @xmath34    by iteratively finding the two best sets of @xmath35 and @xmath36 of @xmath37 light curves from @xmath38 images , where @xmath39 is the residual flux from the average subtracted light curve @xmath40 in image @xmath41 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath42 and @xmath43 are per - image ( @xmath41 ) and per - object ( @xmath40 ) weights and @xmath44 is the uncertainty on @xmath39 . a full description of the detrending algorithm and its application to an ogle data set is given by @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "a stopping criterion must be defined for sysrem so that only the strongest trends are removed and not the signal from planetary transits etc .",
    "the stopping criterion for sysrem was set to remove effects that were stronger than @xmath45% of all random effects ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "the detrending algorithm typically removed two trends , an airmass trend and a second , much less dominant trend , most likely due to colour - dependent atmospheric extinction . in the majority of cases",
    "the stopping criterion was almost satisfied after the removal of the airmass trend only , @xmath47 .",
    "this meant that trends stronger than @xmath48 of all random effects had been corrected with the removal of a single trend , highlighting the absence of systematic noise in the system .",
    "an analysis of the prototype s systematic noise is given in ",
    "[ subsec : systematics ] .",
    "the total optical model is given by the solid black line .",
    "however , we note that the throughput model for the takahashi e-180 may be considerably different beyond @xmath49 nm.,width=336 ]      we observed several target fields with ngts - p during september 2009 to investigate the tracking and autoguiding performance of the telescope .",
    "we monitored a drift of @xmath50 pixels h@xmath7 in the stellar positions on the ccd while autoguiding .",
    "after extensive investigation the source of the flexure remained elusive .",
    "it most likely stemmed from the significant ( @xmath51 cm ) mechanically unsupported back focal distance required to achieve focus with the separate autoguiding telescope and camera .",
    "all of the data presented here therefore contained a slow drift in the stellar positions on the ccd .",
    "our solution to the drifting problem is discussed in more detail in  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "there were a total of @xmath52 optical elements in the beam of the telescope , the dd - ccd , filter and @xmath22 elements inside the takahashi e-180 ( @xmath53 mirrors and @xmath53 lens elements in the corrector ) .",
    "limited information ( @xmath54 nm ) on the spectral response of the mirrors and corrector elements was obtained from takahashi europe . beyond @xmath49",
    "nm only approximations of the spectral response of the telescope can be made .",
    "the reflectance of each mirror beyond @xmath49 nm was approximated using the spectral response of aluminium .",
    "the relative reflectance of mirror aluminium was measured in the lab and the reflectance curve was calibrated using the data from takahashi .",
    "the maximum reflectance of the takahashi mirror occurs between @xmath55 and @xmath19 nm where @xmath56% of the light is reflected .",
    "the relative reflection curve of mirror aluminium was scaled to match the takahashi reflectance in this wavelength range .",
    "this allowed us to estimate of the mirror response beyond @xmath49 nm . however , we note that the peak reflectance of uncoated aluminium is typically @xmath57% , hinting that the mirrors in the takahashi e-180 might be coated and therefore respond differently beyond @xmath49 nm .",
    "it is possible that the real efficiency is less than quoted here .",
    "it was more difficult to estimate the transmission of the corrector beyond @xmath49 nm without knowing more about the type of glass used and any coatings which may have been applied . in this case",
    "a simple extrapolation of the takahashi data was made from @xmath49 to @xmath58 nm . the broadband ngts - p pseudo-@xmath23 filter was used for the majority of the observations hence for simplicity its average throughput of @xmath59% has been applied at all wavelengths in the optical model .",
    "ikon1 was most sensitive at @xmath60 nm with a steep decline in qe beyond @xmath58 nm .",
    "all the optical elements have been combined in fig [ figure : opticalmodel ] to give a theoretical model of the optical system .",
    "the model presented here excludes the @xmath61% reduction in the collecting area of the telescope caused by the secondary mirror obstruction .    to characterise the optical performance of the telescope and camera we monitored the change in psf with the ambient temperature .",
    "the psf remained suitably constant with time and temperature ( see fig [ figure : psfwtimewtemp ] ) , however a small correlation between telescope focus and temperature was observed .",
    "although the previous correlation with temperature was within our desired limits , the final telescope design of ngts uses a carbon fibre structure which further minimises the effects of temperature changes .",
    "we also monitored the scattered light content in the flat fields and discovered a significant amount of scattered light in the twilight flats .",
    "this was traced to scattered light reflecting from the inside of the telescope and striking the ccd from outside the beam .",
    "we installed a lightweight baffle which reduced the effects of the scattered light but finally , as explained in ",
    "[ sec : observations ] , we decided not to flat field the prototype data due to the additional noise added during the flat fielding process .",
    "as the estimated throughput of the takahashi e-180 was unsuitably low ( @xmath62% between @xmath63 nm ) and confirmation of this was unavailable from the manufacturer , a different red - optimised telescope made by astro system austria has been implemented in the final ngts facility .",
    "the internal surfaces of the new telescopes are coated with a black flocking material and a @xmath19 mm long baffling collar has been fitted to each telescope aperture to reduce the impact of scattered light . the solutions to the optical issues with ngts - p are further described in  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we characterised the photometric performance of ngts - p by observing a given field from the eastern horizon to the meridian over many nights , with sky brightnesses ranging from full to new moon conditions .",
    "the data were reduced using the method outlined in  [ sec : observations ] and we created diagrams of the root mean squared ( rms ) of the light curve noise vs magnitude and rms of the light curve noise vs binned exposure time diagrams for each night .",
    "the rms vs magnitude diagram was compared to a theoretical noise model of the telescope and the rms vs binned exposure time diagram was compared to the @xmath64 decrease in rms expected in the presence of gaussian ( white ) noise only , where @xmath65 is the number of points per bin .",
    "the results from two typical nights ( @xmath8 during full and @xmath8 during new moon conditions ) can be seen in fig [ figure : photometricaccruacy ] .",
    "fig [ figure : photometricaccruacy ] shows that our goal of achieving @xmath8 mmag photometry of bright sources is possible in @xmath66 s during new moon conditions , and @xmath67 mmag rms is achievable on the same time scale during full moon .",
    "this was promising given that the tracking and scattered light issues previously highlighted still required addressing .",
    "we investigated the effects of systematic noise in the data by measuring the fractional improvement in the rms of the noise in the light curves after the removal of up to @xmath22 trends using sysrem .",
    "individual trends can be removed by overriding the stopping criterion of sysrem .",
    "we note that trends varying non - linearly with time ( e.g. from scattered light ) would not be identified by sysrem and hence remain in the light curves .",
    "the results after the forced removal of @xmath8 , @xmath53 , @xmath68 and @xmath22 trends can be seen in fig [ figure : tamuz1 - 4 ] .",
    "it is clear that the largest fractional improvement comes from correcting the atmospheric extinction caused by the airmass ( see fig [ figure : tamuz1 - 4 ] panel b , red points ) and that the removal of subsequent trends resulted in less significant improvements . given that the stopping criterion for sysrem was typically satisfied after the removal of @xmath8 or @xmath53 trends only ( see fig [ figure : tamuz1 - 4 ] red and black points , respectively ) and that the rms with binned exposure time follows a decrease as @xmath64 , we conclude that the system was relatively free from systematic trends .",
    "panel ( a ) of fig [ figure : ffproblem ] also shows that the noise from ngts can also be accounted for using a simple model made up from the typical sources of noise shown below :        @xmath69    where @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the flux from the target , sky , dark current and the read noise inside the photometry aperture , respectively and ;    @xmath74    are the errors from flat fielding and the scintillation noise according to @xcite , respectively .",
    "is the number of pixels inside the photometric aperture , is the combined flux in in the master flat field ( typically , @xmath75 is the diameter of the telescope aperture in cm , is the airmass , @xmath76 is the altitude of the observatory in m , is the atmospheric scale height , @xmath77 is the integration time in s and @xmath78 is a variable dependent on angle between the line of sight and wind direction . when observing perpendicular to the wind , close to the zenith and parallel to the wind , respectively .",
    "the agreement to a simple noise model strengthens further our conclusion that the system is relatively free from systematic noise .",

    "a @xmath29 cm , light - weight foam baffle , covered in black flocking material , was installed on the telescope aperture to further minimise reflections .",
    "this reduced the intensity of the scattered light but its effects were still seen in our photometry .",
    "figure [ figure : ffproblem ] shows the effect of reducing a typical night s data with flat fielding ( black points ) and without ( grey points ) .",
    "the initial difference between flat fielding and not , seen at the bright end of fig [ figure : ffproblem]a , appears insignificant .",
    "however , as seen in fig [ figure : ffproblem]b , measuring the rms vs binned exposure time for the flat fielded data shows a significant systematic effect in the data and the points do not follow the line of @xmath64 expected in the case of gaussian noise only , where @xmath65 is the number of binned points .",
    "excluding the flat fielding process while maintaining the remaining reduction steps removes the systematic trend .",
    "as the scattered light introduces noise in the data non - linearly , sysrem is unable to remove its effect , hence we chose not to flat field the data before analysis .",
    "correct baffling of the final ngts telescopes was therefore critical .",
    "we have designed , built and tested a prototype system ( ngts - p ) for the new , wide - field , transiting exoplanet survey ngts .",
    "the goal of ngts - p was to determine the level of systematic noise in an ngts - like system and prove that millimagnitude photometry or better over a wide field could be achieved on transit time scales with an ngts - like system .",
    "we have shown that millimagnitude photometry is possible using a modest aperture telescope and red - sensitive ccds and that the noise in our system is essentially free from systematic effects .",
    "we have demonstrated our sensitivity to warm - neptune and super - earth sized exoplanets and also highlighted several key areas of ngts which required more consideration .",
    "the prototyping phase has been a success and the lessons learned have been fed directly into the design of the full ngts facility .",
    "ngts is now in routine operation on cerro paranal , chile , having achieved first light in january 2015 .",
    "a detailed description of the final ngts facility is currently being prepared ( wheatley et al . in prep ) .",
    "we would like to thank the anonymous referee for their constructive comments on this paper .",
