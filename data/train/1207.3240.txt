    "if @xmath24 is an eigenvalue with the corresponding eigenvector @xmath0 , bounds for @xmath21 that rely on the angle @xmath14 are called `` a priori , '' since the eigenvector @xmath0 is usually not explicitly known , and some a priori information about @xmath0 needs to be used to bound the angle @xmath14 . in the context of finite element method error bounds , where @xmath0 and @xmath6 are functions ,",
    "such information is usually associated with the smoothness of the function @xmath0 ; see , e.g. ,  @xcite and references there . finally , we call a bound `` a mixed type '' if it involves both terms , the residual norm @xmath22 and the angle @xmath14 .    sharp bounds of the spectrum approximation error are very important in the theory of numerical solution of self - adjoint eigenvalue problems .",
    "computable a posteriori bounds allow one to obtain approximations from below and above to points of the spectrum .",

    "we dedicate section  [ section4 ] to a posteriori bounds .",
    "our `` low - dimensional '' analysis not only allows us to find a novel proof of a well known a posteriori bound , but also gives us an opportunity to improve it , and obtain several new sharper results .",

    "[ rem : v ] we note that @xmath291 , since @xmath292 .",
    "thus , first , the classical a posteriori bounds now trivially follows from our bounds .",
    "second , if the smallest quantity @xmath293 may not be readily accessible in a practical situation , it can be bounded above by the following much simpler expression , @xmath294 , which can still be dramatically smaller compared to the standard value @xmath22 used in the temple bound  . as an alternative for @xmath295",
    "as defined in lemma  [ lemma : technical ] , we can take @xmath296 .    as an illustration of possible improvements in @xmath291 ,",
    "let us again , as in remark [ rem : unbounded ] , consider the example from davis and kahan @xcite in @xmath222 .",
    "let @xmath206 , @xmath297 and @xmath209 .",
    "we get @xmath210 even though both the vector @xmath211 and the residual @xmath298 have infinite norms in @xmath212 .",
    "since @xmath299 , neither temple bound  , nor any other @xmath22-based bound , can be used in this example , as davis and kahan correctly point out in @xcite .    at the same time , let us choose the subspace @xmath262 as described in theorem [ lemma : projectorresidualsqu ] . specifically , since @xmath206 , we have @xmath300 thus @xmath301 is simply the span of the first coordinate sequence @xmath302 , which is the eigenvector of @xmath1 corresponding to the smallest eigenvalue @xmath214 .",
    "this gives @xmath303 and theorem [ lemma : projectorresidualsqu ] turns into its particular case , lemma [ lemma : projectorresidualsquare1 ] . since @xmath278 ,",
    "the sequence @xmath304 is an eigenvector of both operators @xmath1 and @xmath91 corresponding to the same smallest eigenvalue @xmath305 .",
    "then the sequence @xmath306 is the second eigenvector of @xmath91 corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath307 , while @xmath308 rather than explicitly calculating the sequence @xmath309 and its @xmath212 norm , we can take a short cut using lemma  [ lemma : generalresidual1 ] , @xmath310 \\left[\\rho(y)-\\lambda_{\\min}\\left(a_s\\right)\\right]\\\\ & = & \\left[\\frac{1+\\epsilon}{\\epsilon}-(1+\\epsilon)\\right ] \\left[1+\\epsilon-1\\right]\\\\ & = &   1-\\epsilon^2 = \\frac34,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which gives the right - hand side of our bound .",
    "its left - hand side is @xmath311 we conclude that our bound @xmath312 holds , while the temple bound fails , giving just the trivial statement @xmath313 .    by modifying the choice of the sequence @xmath6 in the example above ,",
    "e.g.,by choosing @xmath314 , one can construct similar situations , but where theorem [ lemma : projectorresidualsqu ] is different from lemma [ lemma : projectorresidualsquare1 ] .",
    "let us finally comment that in this example our alternative choices for the subspace @xmath315 , namely , @xmath295 as in lemma [ lemma : technical ] or @xmath316 as in remark [ rem : v ] , give extremely different results .",
    "evidently , the first choice leads to @xmath317 and gives no improvement compared to the broken temple bound , while the second choice gives @xmath318 and works , as has already been shown above .",
    "this example demonstrates an opportunity to easily treat unbounded operators .",
    "the unbounded case naturally appears for partial differential operators in the @xmath319 norm ; see , e.g.,@xcite for a similar approach to analyze the finite element method .",
    "the main topic of this work is rq bounds . however , having the machinery of identities already constructed in section [ section2 ] , we need only very little extra effort to revisit and improve some well known error bounds for eigenvectors , as a bonus .",
    "the reader might have noticed a couple of identities , and , that have not yet been used .",
    "for convenience , we repeat them here , changing the notation in , for the case where @xmath205 , the vector @xmath0 is an eigenvector of @xmath1 ( and , thus , @xmath91 ) with the eigenvalue @xmath320 , the scalar @xmath193 denotes the other eigenvalue of @xmath91 , and @xmath321 : @xmath322 and , if @xmath323 @xmath324    in order to use identities and , one needs to bound the scalar @xmath325 .",
    "it is easily possible in the special case where @xmath326 or @xmath327 .",
    "the latter choice is reduced to the former one by substituting @xmath286 for @xmath1 .",
    "we can use the arguments from the proof of lemma [ lemma : projectorresidualsquare1 ] to handle the case @xmath326 . let the assumptions of lemma [ lemma : projectorresidualsquare1 ] be satisfied ,",
    "i.e. , let @xmath230 be an isolated point of the spectrum of @xmath1 and @xmath231 be the nearest larger point of the spectrum of @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath232 denote the complete eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath328 for a given vector @xmath236 , such that @xmath237 , we define @xmath238 , where @xmath234 is the orthogonal projector to the subspace @xmath232 ; and we denote @xmath205",
    ". then @xmath329 and @xmath330 , directly by the proof of lemma [ lemma : projectorresidualsquare1 ] .",
    "substituting @xmath330 in and , we obtain the following improvements of the corresponding bounds from  @xcite , @xmath331 and , if @xmath323 from  @xcite ( see a single - vector version in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 11.7.1 ) ) , @xmath332    the example from davis and kahan @xcite , discussed above , is also applicable here , to observe that the use of the norm of the projected residual @xmath258 in our bounds can bring a dramatic improvement compared to the traditional term @xmath259 .",
    "one final observation concerns the classical @xmath333 bound , see , e.g. , @xcite and , for a single - vector version that we use here , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 6.22 ) or ( * ? ? ? * theorem 3.9 ) , @xmath334 where @xmath69 .",
    "interestingly , an attempt of a naive improvement of , where @xmath258 simply substitutes for @xmath259 without any other changes , fails as the following example demonstrates .",
    "let @xmath335 and @xmath336 .",
    "we get @xmath337 and @xmath338 , so @xmath339 .",
    "let @xmath340 with @xmath341 .",
    "the residual @xmath342 is perpendicular both to @xmath0 and @xmath6 , thus @xmath343 while @xmath344 and @xmath345 at the same time , @xmath346 , i.e. ,  the original @xmath333 bound holds fine .",
    "the moral of this observation is that one can not just blindly substitute @xmath258 for @xmath259 and hope for improvement without breaking the original statement .",
    "we demonstrate the fundamental nature of our new rq identities and concise inequalities , by using them to derive , in a unifying manner , and improve several known eigenvalue error bounds , including the famous temple bound .",
    "the next natural step is to attempt to extend our single - vector rq results to matrix rq , thus hoping to simplify the derivation and to improve some classical results for the rayleigh - ritz method .",
    "we conjecture , by analogy with the approach of this paper , that the key to such a development is a careful sharp analysis of sensitivity of the ritz values with respect to variations in the trial subspace in the rayleigh - ritz method .",
