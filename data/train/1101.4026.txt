    "clusters of galaxies with steeply rising x - ray surface brightness profiles are known as cool core clusters , and require strong feedback from their central agn to offset cooling of the intracluster medium ( icm ) .    for highly - luminous cool core clusters ( with @xmath4 ) ,",
    "the central agn must be injecting on average @xmath5 into the surrounding medium .",
    "we do not know the black hole ( bh ) mass for most of these agn but we expect that they lie between @xmath6 and @xmath7 , based on the few reliable measurements in the literature ( e. g. m87 , ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "* macchetto et al . 1997 ) ) .",
    "given that these objects are in an exceptional environment and are active continuously , it is not clear that the standard @xmath8 or @xmath9 relations are relevant for them . for @xmath10 ,",
    "this means that these black holes must be operating at high enough eddington rates that they should be radiatively efficient ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we would therefore expect to see an x - ray point source .",
    "we present a sample of strong cool core , highly - luminous clusters , for which there is _ _",
    "n__o evidence of a nuclear x - ray point source in the @xmath1 images . using these images ,",
    "we derive upper limits of the nuclear luminosities with the web interface of pimms ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* mukai 1993 ) ) , which converts a count rate into an expected flux .",
    "we also investigate whether there is a hidden power law in the x - ray spectra , but find no such evidence in any of our objects .",
    "finally , we calculate the energy that must be injected by the agn in order to offset the cooling ( ) of the icm , and compare it with the nuclear luminosity of the agn .",
    ", then for @xmath10 the power exceeds @xmath11 , indicating that @xmath12 , i.e. we should see a nuclear point source . for @xmath13 ,",
    "the power exceeds @xmath14 .",
    "here , @xmath15 could dominate over , if the black hole is in a low accretion state . ]",
    "our results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , and reveal a significant population of objects requiring high kinetic input from an agn to offset cooling and/or high jet power , yet are without a detected x - ray nucleus .",
    "these objects appear to be radiatively inefficient with on average , @xmath16 .",
    "we examine 7 possible explanations as to why these objects appear to be so radiatively - inefficient .            *",
    "first , they could simply be strongly doppler - suppressed .",
    "however , all jets would need to be aligned with the plane of the sky , and it is unlikely that all of our objects have jets with a preferred geometry . *",
    "second , we could be dealing with advection dominated accretion flows ( ( * ? ? ? * narayan & mcclintock 2008 ) ) , but it would be difficult to obtain jet powers of @xmath5 . * next , our objects could have magnetically - dominated black holes , but the mechanism responsible for creating jets in magnetically - dominated accretion discs still remains poorly understood , which makes it difficult to give any definitive conclusion . * they could also be highly - absorbed .",
    "the power must then emerge at longer wavelengths .",
    "however , only three of our central agn have large ir luminosities .",
    "furthermore , this luminosity is from @xmath17 data , and remains un - resolved for our objects .",
    "most of the far ir emission is also likely due to young stars , since there is much evidence from excess blue light , that there is ongoing star formation in our objects ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* odea et al . 2008 ) ) .",
    "* we could be looking at the variability of how many x - rays are produced by the core ( i.e. the radiative efficiency of the jets ) .",
    "perhaps the radiative efficiency of a jet depends on how much interaction occurs between the jet and surrounding gas .",
    "extremely powerful steady jets may create a channel which results in little such interaction .",
    "* next , they could be spin - powered black holes which could allow a strong jet to be created while keeping the agn radiatively dim ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* mcnamara et al . 2009 ) ) . a high spin parameter",
    "would then be required , which according to our significant population of objects , would mean that highly rotating bhs are not rare .",
    "* finally , a promising explanation could be that our objects have an ultra - massive black hole ( @xmath13 ) , then the radiative power could fall well below the kinetic power as shown in fig .",
    "we have identified a population of objects which require powerful jets to be present but have no x - ray detectable nucleus . we have also identified a range of possible explanations , each of which carries significant implication for the origin and operation of jets .",
    "the black holes may be ultramassive ( @xmath18 ) , or have very high spin , or be highly obscured",
    ". they may also be mostly off , yet unobservable when they are switched on , or have highly radiatively inefficient jets .",
