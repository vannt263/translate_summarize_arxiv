    "xb1254690 is a persistently bright , low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) .",
    "it was identified with a faint blue star ( grmus , _ v _ = 19.1 ) , which exhibited the bowen blend of niii and ciii in emission @xcite .",
    "the object produced type 1 x - ray bursts @xcite , indicating the presence of a neutron star as the compact object .",
    "dips of up to 95% of the 110 kev flux , with a recurrence period of _ @xmath4",
    "_ = 3.88 @xmath5 0.15 hr and lasting @xmath0 0.8 hr per cycle , were discovered in _",
    "data by @xcite .",
    "the dips are caused by obscuration of the central source by a bulge on the outer edge of the accretion disc , implying a moderately high inclination .    from _",
    "v_-band observations of the optical counterpart , @xcite determined an optical ephemeris where minimum light occurs at _ @xmath6 _ = jd 2,445,735.693 ( 4 ) + 0.163890 ( 9 ) days , equivalent to a period of _ @xmath7 _ = 3.9334 @xmath5 0.0002 hr .",
    "this broad optical modulation is probably due to the changing visibility of the heated face of the secondary star in the system , with an additional contribution from the x - ray heated bulge , although other explanations such as an asymmetrical disc or occultation of the disc by the companion can not be ruled out . within the errors ,",
    "the optical and x - ray period measurements are consistent , with later x - ray observations indicating that the optical modulation provides a more accurate measurement of the orbital period @xcite .",
    "a short section of simultaneous x - ray and optical coverage showed that the optical minimum occurs @xmath0 0.16 in phase after the centre of the x - ray dips @xcite .",
    "simple geometrical modelling is possible by considering the x - ray illuminated area of the companion star , disc radius , disc opening angle , and inclination at given distances which are compatible with the observed optical flux and the amplitude of the light curve .",
    "this leads to constraints on the source inclination of 65@xmath873@xmath8 , and on the distance of 8 - 15 kpc @xcite .",
    "the first mass constraints for this system were based upon a unique relation between the orbital period and the mass of the companion , assuming that the companion is a low mass , zero - age main sequence star filling its roche lobe @xcite . using this approximation , @xcite estimate the mass of the companion to be in the region of @xmath9 .",
    "the first kinematic mass constraints were proposed by @xcite , who obtained intermediate resolution ( @xmath0 3 ) spectra using the 4 m telescope at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory . assuming that velocities derived from the heii  @xmath14686 emission line centroid represent the motion of the compact star and not , for example , the streaming of gas between the stars or out of the system",
    ", then approximate stellar masses can be derived using the mass function .",
    "the result is consistent with a low - mass main - sequence star ( _ m _ @xmath10 0.5 - 0.8 @xmath11 ) and a canonical 1.4 @xmath11 neutron star .    in the remainder of this paper",
    "we will attempt to confirm and better constrain these mass estimates using high - resolution blue optical spectroscopy .",
    "we will measure the wings of the heii  @xmath14686 emission line to gain an estimate for the compact object velocity ( section 3.3 ) , and use the bowen fluorescence technique @xcite to measure the donor star velocity ( section 3.4 ) .",
    "we also obtained simultaneous x - ray observations ( see section 3.1 ) in order to re - establish the ephemeris of @xcite .",
    "this can not be extended to the observations described herein because the propagated uncertainty in phase is now comparable to the orbital period itself .",
    "we have obtained simultaneous optical and x - ray data for grmus / xb1254690 .",
    "the journal of observations is given in table [ tabobsmus ] .",
    ".log of observations of grmus / xb1254690 [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      phase - resolved spectroscopy of grmus was obtained from 26 to 28 may 2004 using the fors2 spectrograph mounted on the vlt / ut4 at eso s paranal observatory . during each night",
    "we observed grmus for @xmath10 one full orbit , resulting in a total of 38 spectra with an integration time of 900s each .",
    "we used the 1400v volume - phased holographic grism , and a slit width of 0.7@xmath12 , giving a wavelength coverage of @xmath1@xmath14513 - 5814 with a resolution of 70 kms@xmath13 ( fwhm ) .",
    "the seeing during these observations varied between 0.5 and 2.1 arcsec .",
    "the slit was orientated at a position angle of 88.15@xmath8 to include a comparison star in order to calibrate slit losses .",
    "we observed the flux standard feige 110 with the same instrumental set - up in order to correct for the instrumental response .",
    "he , ne , hg and cd arc lamp exposures were taken during daytime for the wavelength calibration scale .",
    "we de - biased and flat - fielded all of the images and used optimal extraction techniques to maximise the signal - to - noise ratio of the extracted spectra @xcite .",
    "the pixel - to - wavelength scale was derived through polynomial fits to a large number of identified reference lines resulting in a dispersion of 0.64   pix@xmath13 .",
    "velocity drifts due to instrumental flexure ( found to be always @xmath145 kms@xmath13 ) were corrected by cross - correlation with the sky spectra .",
    "simultaneous x - ray data from xb1254690 were obtained using the proportional counter array ( pca ) on board the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) . the proportional counter array ( pca ; for a detailed description , see @xcite ) onboard the _ rxte _ satellite consists of an array of 5 co - aligned proportional counter units ( pcus ) that are sensitive to photons of energy 2 to 60 kev with a total collecting area of 6500  @xmath15 .",
    "we obtained 36 ks of total coverage during our optical observations . for our analysis",
    "we only used the data from the standard 2 configuration , with a time resolution of 16 seconds .",
    "the ephemeris of @xcite is now out of date because the propagated uncertainty in phase is over a factor of 2 greater than the orbital period .",
    "we therefore need to make use of our contemporaneous _ rxte _",
    "observations to set a new zero point using the x - ray dips ( note that we still use the @xcite orbital period ) .",
    "this is not quite as simple as it would first appear since there are large variations in dip depth and structure that are apparent from observation to observation , as well as cycle to cycle @xcite .",
    "additionally , a note of caution must be sounded since in a number of earlier _ rxte _ and _ bepposax _ observations @xcite , x - ray dipping was not observed at all , with an accompanying decrease in the mean optical variability of the source . with the combination of these effects , it was suggested that the vertical structure on the accretion disc edge , associated with the impact point of the accretion stream , had decreased in angular size at the time of these earlier observations .",
    "the cause of this intermittent reduction in opening angle is not understood .",
    "our observations include just one deep dipping episode ( fig .",
    "[ xray ] ) , co - incident with our first night of optical observations .",
    "xb1254690 typically exhibits ` shoulders ' of dipping , i.e. regions both before and after the deep dipping in which there is a small decrease of intensity .",
    "each shoulder of the dip lasts @xmath0650925 seconds , during which the total count rate in the 2 - 25 kev band drops by @xmath015% with no strong changes in the hardness ratio .",
    "the shoulder is followed by an interval of strongly variable deep dipping lasting @xmath01100 seconds @xcite , with associated strong changes in the hardness ratio ( fig . [ hard ] ) .",
    "the hardening of the spectra in the dips is most likely to be due to absorption by cold matter .",
    "our observation of a dipping episode opens with the system already in the first shoulder phase , the onset of deep dipping occurring approximately 200250 seconds into the observation ( before a brief return of the source intensity to the non - dip level ) , and then continuing to capture the full egress from deep dipping , into the shoulder and then returning to the continuum level .",
    "note that the return of the source intensity to the non - dip level during this episode is not unusual , and the light curve can in fact be interpreted as superpositions of small micro - dips ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "unfortunately , the lack of information regarding the full ingress to deep dipping through the preceding shoulder introduces a degree of uncertainty into our estimate of the dip centre .",
    "for example we could potentially be observing only a small section of an extended deep dipping episode ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* report dips lasting for @xmath040 minutes ) .",
    "if this is the case , the absence of the beginning of the dip will cause the estimate for dip centre to be incorrect .",
    "nevertheless , we do have cause for optimism . the deep dipping which we observe",
    "is approximately 1100 seconds in length , equivalent to the typical period of a dipping episode in xb1254690 ( see above ) .",
    "this is a strong indicator that we have full , or nearly - full , coverage of the deep dipping phase .",
    "we estimate the dip centre by eye , taking the mid - point between the onset of and exit from deep dipping ( which can be determined with the help of the associated hardness ratio changes , see fig . [ hard ] ) .",
    "this occurs at @xmath16 = jd 2453151.647 ( 3 ) . from @xcite",
    "we know that the dip centre has an average orbital phase of 0.84 ( with phase 0 occurring at optical minimum ) .",
    "we therefore estimate a new value for @xmath17 of jd 2453151.509 ( 3 ) .",
    "there are problems with the reliability of an ephemeris generated from just a single dipping episode , not least because we do not have full coverage either side of the dip .",
    "it is therefore hard to estimate the dip centre with absolute confidence .",
    "however , we are encouraged by the fact that our dip lies within 0.05 phase of the 1999 dips ( the propagated phase uncertainty from these dips is of the order @xmath00.6 ) reported by @xcite .",
    "more importantly , the continuum lightcurve from the resulting ephemeris possesses the same phasing relation reported by @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ lcurve ] ) . in light of this evidence",
    "we are confident that we have identified the dip centre correctly and we will use this zero - point to calculate orbital phases throughout the remainder of this paper .",
    "the continuum subtracted average of the 38 individual optical spectra , corresponding to an exposure time of nearly 10 hours , is given in fig .",
    "the overall spectrum resembles that of other lmxbs , with high excitation lines superposed on a blue continuum .",
    "this is typical of strongly x - ray heated accretion discs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the blue end of the optical spectrum in this system is dominated by the bowen emission blend of ciii and niii .",
    "heii @xmath14686 is also seen strongly in emission , in addition to weaker h@xmath18 and heii @xmath15411 .",
    "the absorption component longward of h@xmath18 is observed in a few other lmxbs such as x1822371 @xcite , xtej2123058 @xcite , gx3394 @xcite and mmser @xcite .",
    "the narrow emission feature at 5577  is [ oi ] , a strong night - sky line useful for confirming the veracity of our wavelength calibration .",
    "the broad features between 49005300   remain unidentified .",
    "the absence of these features in our comparison star lead us to believe that they are real .",
    "we also see some of these ` bumps ' in other lmxbs ( e.g. gx9 + 9 , x1822371 , v801ara , v926sco ) , and perhaps they are blends of a number of different weak emission lines",
    ". part of this could be hei @xmath14922 and @xmath15016 , and also feii   @xmath14924 , @xmath15018 , @xmath15169 and @xmath15297 .",
    "there are also several oii and oiii lines between 48915006  which may explain the large bump at @xmath04930 .",
    "note also that the bowen blend ( and to a lesser extent the heii @xmath14686 emission line ) appears to be sitting upon a broad emission ` hump ' .",
    "this has been noted in other lmxbs ( e.g. v801ara ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and attributed to a blend of feii emission lines @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ trail ] , we display the bowen blend and heii  @xmath14686 in the form of a trailed spectrogram .",
    "all of the individual spectra were first normalized to the continuum using a third - order polynomial fit , and then phase - folded into 15 bins .",
    "the spectra were then smoothed using a gaussian filter with a fwhm of two pixels .",
    "we see a clear s - wave structure modulated on the orbital period in the heii @xmath14686 emission .",
    "the blue - to - red crossing phase is @xmath00.6 and the semi - amplitude @xmath0250 kms@xmath13 .",
    "this behaviour indicates a close association with the accretion disc or compact object .",
    "there is also an additional , weaker , component present .",
    "again , this is modulated on the orbital period , approximately a quarter cycle out of phase with the more prominent component .",
    "there also appear to be faint traces of two anti - phased sharp components in the bowen blend though the broad underlying component moves in phase with the accretion disc s - wave ( maximum blue - shift at phase 0.25 ) .",
    "the tomograms discussed in section 3.4 will help to characterise these spectral trails more thoroughly .",
    "the h@xmath18 line is shown in the right - hand panel in fig .",
    "[ trail ] , along with the broad emission feature at @xmath04930 .",
    "the absorption component longward of h@xmath18 is present at all phases , and in common with the emission component displays an s - wave approximately in phase with the expected motion of the accretion disc .",
    "the broad feature at @xmath04930  also displays a s - wave .",
    "the heii @xmath15411 emission line is too weak in the individual spectra to produce a trailed spectrogram .",
    "early attempts to determine any kinematic constraints on this system met with limited success .",
    "@xcite noted that the relative weakness of the emission lines in their spectra did not allow for the study of their variation with orbital phase .",
    "however , they did exclude the possibility of orbital motion of heii @xmath14686 ( which requires a source of highly ionising radiation , and is typically seen in accretion discs ) in excess of 300 kms@xmath13 .",
    "later observations by @xcite did result in a measurement of the same heii line s core velocity , which possessed a semi - amplitude of 114 @xmath5 13 kms@xmath13 .",
    "however , this is not a particularly reliable measurement of the compact object velocity .",
    "the line core can often be heavily contaminated by other emission sites ( see fig .",
    "[ profile ] ) , for example from the accretion stream or ` hot - spots ' on the accretion disc itself .    instead",
    ", the compact object velocity can be better estimated by examining the wings of the emission line .",
    "these wings find their origin in the high - velocity gas of the inner accretion disc , very close to the compact object itself .",
    "presumably this gas will closely replicate the motion of the compact object , and it is far less likely that alternative emission sites will provide a strong contaminating effect .",
    "however , this method is not immune to contamination and we must be cautious in accepting the results of this analysis .    we have followed the double - gaussian technique @xcite to estimate both the velocity semi - amplitude @xmath19 and the systemic velocity @xmath20 of the compact object from heii @xmath14686 .",
    "we employed a double gaussian bandpass with fwhm of 100 kms@xmath13 and gaussian separations of 3001700 kms@xmath13 in steps of 100 kms@xmath13 .",
    "radial velocity curves of line sections with separations of 7001400 kms@xmath13 yield consistent results with a median blue - to - red crossing phase of 0.58 @xmath5 0.03 , median velocity semi - amplitude @xmath19 = 130 @xmath5 16 kms@xmath13 and median systemic velocity @xmath20 = 173 @xmath5 12 kms@xmath13 ( fig .",
    "[ diag ] ) .",
    "the errors are conservatively taken from the maximum error obtained from sine wave fits to the results from each individual line section .",
    "separations below 700 kms@xmath13 suffer badly from contamination by the line core , whilst separations over 1400 kms@xmath13 become corrupted by continuum noise and the bowen emission blend . the small difference in phasing ( 0.08 orbits ; slightly larger than the ephemeris uncertainty of @xmath00.02 orbits ) indicates that even the line wings may be contaminated to some extent by inhomogeneities in the disc .",
    "this contamination will also affect the measurements of @xmath19 and @xmath20 to some extent .",
    "nevertheless , this remains the best method for estimating @xmath19 from our own and other currently available data .",
    "unfortunately , the heii  @xmath15411 and h@xmath18 emission lines , which are clearly seen in our averaged spectrum ( fig . [ spec ] ) , are too weak in the individual spectra for a similar analysis .",
    "the fitting procedures are simply dominated by noise .",
    "we can use doppler tomography @xcite to measure the radial velocity amplitudes of any weak , narrow , emission lines that may be present . by mapping the observed data onto a velocity coordinate frame",
    ", doppler tomography makes use of all data at once and can thus be used to search for features that are too weak to be distinguished in each individual spectrum .",
    "one effectively resolves the distribution of line emission in the co - rotating frame of the binary system , providing an excellent tool for identifying the origin and kinematics of the various emission components .",
    "it also allows us to map the emission line distribution from the broader heii and h@xmath18 lines .",
    "secondary star emission is readily identifiable in doppler tomograms since the solid body rotation of the roche lobe is mapped to a corresponding roche lobe area along the positive v@xmath21-axis . for reference , in figs .",
    "[ dheii][dniii ] we overplot the area of the roche lobe and the centres of mass of the donor star ( uppermost cross ) , full system ( map centre ) and the compact object ( lower cross ) assuming a mass ratio of @xmath00.4 ( equivalent to the mass ratio proposed by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and compact object velocity of 130 kms@xmath13",
    ". additionally , we have overplotted the ballistic accretion stream for such a system .",
    "the circle , centred upon the compact object and with radius 600 kms@xmath13 , indicates the common emission regions from a generic lmxb accretion disc .",
    "we employed a maximum entropy implementation of doppler tomography whereby the data are fitted under the added constraint of maximizing the entropy ( i.e. image smoothness ) of the tomogram @xcite .",
    "this reduces the presence of noise artifacts in the recovered tomograms and allows for a simultaneous fit to a number of heavily blended lines .    in fig .",
    "[ dheii ] we display a tomogram of the heii  @xmath14686 emission line .",
    "this displays a clear enhancement in the lower left quadrant and an additional component close to the accretion stream .",
    "we do not observe the classic ring - like distribution of the accretion disc , presumably due to the strength of the line core features vastly overwhelming the high velocity inner disc emission .",
    "for this reason we can not be fully confident in the results of the double gaussian technique ( see section 3.3 ) , though this remains at present the best method for estimating @xmath19 .",
    "the enhancement in the ( lower ) left quadrant is also seen in the tomograms of h@xmath18 ( fig .",
    "[ dhb ] ) and heii @xmath15411 ( fig .",
    "[ d5411 ] ) . whilst this phenomenon is a common feature in the remarkable swsex - type systems @xcite ,",
    "it has also been noted in some other lmxbs , notably xtej2123058 @xcite , gx9 + 9 @xcite and j0422 + 32 @xcite .",
    "however , in this case ( and in the case of x1636536 and x1735444 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the emission is not quite so localised in the lower - left quadrant , but is present in a broad band on the left - hand side of the maps . rather than being an analogue to the highly magnetic swsex - type systems ,",
    "it is likely that this emission is produced in an extended disc bulge . in most lmxbs",
    ", the heii emission is predominantly produced in a hotspot where the accretion stream impacts the disc ( thus producing a spot in the upper left quadrant of a doppler map , e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or is more evenly distributed around the bulk of the accretion disc . if the emitting gas was symmetrically distributed around the primary , the doppler image would reveal a circular distribution centred on @xmath22 = 0 , @xmath23 = -@xmath19 .",
    "this would have been a useful way of confirming the @xmath19 estimate derived from the wings of the heii @xmath14686 emission line .    like heii  @xmath14686",
    ", the heii  @xmath15411 tomogram also indicates the presence of some diffuse emission at velocities which partially correspond to the roche lobe of the donor star .",
    "however , as this emission is diffuse in the doppler map , extending over a broad range of velocities , it is difficult to directly associate this extended emission with the donor star .",
    "fluorescent emission from the donor in this case should manifest itself as a tightly concentrated spot situated on the positive @xmath23 axis .    in fig .",
    "[ dniii ] we present a tomogram of the niii @xmath14640 emission line .",
    "the maximum entropy method of producing doppler tomograms allows for a simultaneous fit to a number of different lines to produce one map .",
    "however , in this case the niii @xmath14640 line strongly dominates over any others in the bowen blend .",
    "we see two regions of enhanced emission .",
    "the brighter of the two spots occurs at a combination of phasing and velocity where we would expect the donor star to be fluorescing .",
    "the small horizontal offset of @xmath22@xmath1035@xmath530 kms@xmath13 is consistent with the errors in our ephemeris ( @xmath5 0.02 in phase ) .",
    "the second spot occurs at a much lower velocity , and is 12 @xmath24 weaker ( relative to the local noise level ) than the first .",
    "it is difficult to provide a truly satisfactory explanation for its origin .",
    "perhaps it traces some form of low velocity outflow ( e.g. disc wind ) , though why it should be preferentially observed at an apparent phase of @xmath00.25 remains a mystery ( orbital phase can be considered to increase in a clockwise - fashion around a doppler map ) .    if we presume that the bright spot in fig .",
    "[ dniii ] is caused by the irradiated inner face of the donor star , this is an excellent tracer for the kinematics of the system .",
    "the precise location of the spot can be measured using a two - dimensional gaussian fit ( though bearing in mind that the actual shape of the spot is not expected to be gaussian ) , providing a velocity of @xmath25 = 245 @xmath5 30 kms@xmath13 . using this value",
    "we can shift all of our spectra into the rest - frame of the ( irradiated face of the ) donor . a sharp niii  @xmath14640 component is clearly resolved ( fig . [ donorspec ] ) . however , since this is a measure of the motion of the irradiated inner face of the donor star , it only provides us with a lower - limit on the velocity of the centre of mass ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one final piece of information remains to be extracted from the doppler tomograms ; assigning the correct systemic velocity should produce the most sharply defined features in a doppler map .",
    "we used the heii and niii doppler maps to verify the systemic velocity .",
    "the @xmath26 value of the map was calculated for a range of @xmath20 , and the best fit in terms of minimal @xmath26 was achieved for @xmath20 = 192 @xmath5 2 km s@xmath13 for the niii map and @xmath20 = 185 @xmath5 2 km s@xmath13 for heii  @xmath14686 .",
    "these are both consistent with , if slightly higher than , the results derived from the heii @xmath14686 wings in section 3.3 .",
    "the complex , asymmetric core profile of the heii emission line could be contaminating one wing more than the other , leading to this small offset .",
    "we heretofore adopt the value for @xmath20 derived from the heii  @xmath14686 doppler map .",
    "this should be more reliable than the niii map since only a single , isolated emission line is involved in the fitting process , rather than the more complicated blend of bowen lines .",
    "whilst the systemic velocities inferred from both the wings of the heii @xmath14686 line and the doppler tomograms are self - consistent ( @xmath0 185 kms@xmath13 ) , they are considerably higher than the earlier estimate by @xcite ( 98 @xmath5 10 kms@xmath13 ) . this measurement was obtained from rather low quality data , with poor spectral and temporal resolution .",
    "additionally , they based their measurements on the motion of the heii @xmath14686 line core .",
    "there are a number of different emitting regions which contribute to this line , leading to a complex core structure ( see e.g. figs .",
    "[ profile ] , [ dheii ] ) . a basic measurement of the line centre under the assumption that this will accurately trace",
    "the motion of the compact object will therefore be subject to large systematic errors .    in light of this , we believe that our estimate for the systemic velocity will be a better reflection of the true value .",
    "although large , our measurements do seem reasonable in the context of the high galactic latitude ( @xmath27 = -6.42 ) of grmus ; the neutron star is likely to have received a substantial ` kick ' out of the galactic plane at birth .",
    "a number of statistical studies on pulsar velocities have been carried out .",
    "these studies give a mean birth velocity of 100500 km s@xmath13 , with some possessing velocities of @xmath281000 km s@xmath13 @xcite .      the niii doppler map ( fig .",
    "[ dniii ] ) appears to display enhanced emission in the region of and at the phasing where we would expect to see the companion star roche lobe , in addition to an abundance of noisy structure in the outer regions of the map .",
    "a useful way to confirm the validity of the doppler map is to observe the behaviour of sharp components in our trailed spectrogram ( fig .",
    "[ trail ] ) .",
    "this is not trivial due to the faintness of grmus compared to a system such as scox-1 , which clearly features narrow bowen lines moving in phase with the donor star @xcite .",
    "4686 emission line and the left hand panel shows the ideal trailed spectrogram reconstructed from the doppler tomogram shown in fig .",
    "[ dheii ] .",
    "orbital phase is plotted along the @xmath29-axis . ]",
    "we can reconstruct an ideal trailed spectrogram from the doppler tomograms to test for systematic residuals in the maps . as a test , we first apply this technique to the heii @xmath14686 emission line .",
    "the two distinct components we see in the doppler map ( fig .",
    "[ dheii ] ) are reproduced clearly in the predicted trailed spectrogram ( left hand panel , ( fig .",
    "[ pheii ] ) , and can be easily identified in the observed data . for the case of the niii @xmath14640 emission line ( fig .",
    "[ pniii ] ) we again see two components in the reconstructed spectrogram , though not quite so distinctly as for the case of heii . comparing this idealised image to the real data it is indeed possible to detect faint traces of these two narrow , approximately anti - phased lines which produce the two distinct spots in fig .",
    "[ dniii ] .",
    "the second spot is therefore unlikely to be a systematic residual produced when creating the doppler map , and its unusual phasing / positioning could perhaps therefore be attributed to a region which violates one of the axioms of doppler tomography , for example that all motion should be parallel to the orbital plane .",
    "note that a violation of these axioms does not mean that the map is erroneous , but it does complicate the successful interpretation of the map .    4640 emission line , part of the bowen emission complex .",

    "@xcite estimated an opening ( semi- ) angle for the accretion disc in grmus of @xmath30 , using a simple geometric model for the reprocessing of x - rays in lmxbs .",
    "it is important to note that this value is hostage to the implicit assumptions underlying these models , for example the geometric description of the disc and of the x - ray emitter .",
    "this will entail a systematic uncertainty that likely exceeds the internal model accuracy of less than a degree .",
    "nevertheless , this value agrees well with @xcite who estimated an opening angle of @xmath31 in order to explain the observed amplitude of the orbital photometric modulation .    we can use this information to derive a mass estimate for the individual components by using the `",
    "k - correction ' algorithm developed by @xcite .",
    "this measures the deviation between the reprocessed light centre of the fluorescence emission lines and the centre of mass of a roche lobe filling star in a persistent lmxb , including the screening effects by a flared accretion disk . using the fourth order polynomial fits given by @xcite for disc opening angles of 8@xmath8 , 10@xmath8 , 12@xmath8 and 14@xmath8 gives a total mass range for the neutron star of 1.20 @xmath2 2.64 .",
    "since the neutron star mass and the mass ratio are related by the mass function ] , we obtain 0.32 @xmath32 0.43 , and limits on the companion mass of 0.45 @xmath3 0.85 .    this correction is dependent upon the opening angle of the accretion disc , monotonically decreasing with opening angle such that the largest opening angle gives the lowest neutron star mass .",
    "since the largest opening angle we have used exceeds the estimates of both @xcite and @xcite , this gives a very conservative lower limit to the neutron star mass , and the true value is unlikely to be so low .",
    "equally , the upper limit is derived using an opening angle lower than that suggested by @xcite and as such the neutron star is unlikely to be quite so massive .",

    "these limits are not a vast improvement over the ones derived above using a range of opening angles from 814@xmath8 .",
    "this indicates that the major source of uncertainty in this case is still incurred from the measurements of @xmath25 and particularly of @xmath19 ( see section 3.3 ) , in addition to the system inclination angle .",
    "the choice of disc opening angle ( within a reasonable range ) has only a small effect in comparison .",
    "nevertheless , we feel it is prudent not to restrict our final mass estimate by the assumption of a disc opening angle of exactly 12@xmath8 , preferring the more conservative range of 814@xmath8 .",
    "the derived parameters for grmus are listed in table [ tabparmus ] .",
    "we know that the companion must be filling its roche lobe in order to permit persistent accretion . there is a well known and useful relationship between the fractional roche lobe radius and the mass - ratio @xcite which can be combined with kepler s 3rd law to provide an estimate of the size of the roche lobe as a function of period . in the case of this system ( with a 3.9 hour period ) , the relationship may be expressed as : @xmath36 .",
    "we can thus derive the range of potential roche lobe radii consistent with the mass range of the companion star that we have derived kinematically .",
    "this turns out to be 0.44 @xmath37 0.55 .",
    "whilst at the lower end of our mass constraints the donor would be consistent with a main - sequence - like object as proposed by @xcite , we can not rule out the possibility that grmus harbours an over - massive evolved companion that has been stripped of its outer layers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we have used the bowen emission blend and doppler tomography to trace for the first time the motion of the donor star in the persistent lmxb grmus .",
    "this has allowed us to derive kinematical mass limits for this system . in combination with estimates for the opening angle of the accretion disc , and new measurements of the heii  @xmath14686 emission line ( in an attempt to trace the motion of the compact object )",
    ", we have derived tentative new mass constraints of 1.20 @xmath2 2.64 for the compact object and 0.45 @xmath3 0.85 for the companion star .",
    "we can not rule out the possibility that grmus harbours an over - massive evolved companion star , or more intriguingly an over - massive neutron star .",
    "tighter constraints on the system parameters may therefore have important implications for our knowledge of the equation of state of nuclear matter ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or indeed on the formation scenarios for typical lmxbs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "future investigations should also concentrate on determining the origin of the unusual second spot in the niii doppler map ( fig .",
    "[ dniii ] ) .",
    "this feature is hard to explain , and perhaps could be caused by a violation of the axioms of doppler tomography .",
    "related to this point , the broad emission band seen in the left hand side of the doppler maps for heii and h@xmath18 ( in this system and a number of others ) is of uncertain origin .",
