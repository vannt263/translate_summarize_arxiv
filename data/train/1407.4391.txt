    "as the nearest large spiral galaxy , m31 offers a unique opportunity to study planetary nebulae ( pne ) on a galactic scale .",
    "stars born with masses between 0.8 - 8 @xmath4 will likely go through a planetary nebula phase , making pne good tracers of old stellar populations . due to the short time",
    "scales between the agb and pn phases , the distribution and kinematics of pne are expected to be identical to their parent population .",
    "studying pne as a population provides insight into galactic structure and evolution .",
    "understanding their evolution individually can provide insight into pn structure , formation , and enrichment of the interstellar medium and provide constraints for future pn evolutionary models .",
    "studying pne has the additional benefit of ease of detection and classification due to their strong emission features and unique spectra .",
    "further , the population of pne in m31 all lie at the same distance , making it possible to directly relate the luminosity and emission of a large and diverse sample of pne .",
    "previous surveys have identified and studied thousands of pne throughout the disk and bulge of m31 @xcite .",
    "recent spectroscopic studies have begun to dig deeper into their physical properties @xcite .",
    "the largest survey of m31 pne to date is a deep kinematic survey performed by @xcite ( hereafter m06 ) using the purpose - built planetary nebula spectrograph @xcite , which can simultaneously detect pne and measure their radial velocities .",
    "m06 identified 3300 emission - line objects in m31 , of which 2615 are likely to be pne .",
    "single - purpose spectroscopic surveys are very useful for studying the properties of individual pne , but can be time consuming and costly .",
    "in contrast , multi - purpose photometric surveys can offer substantial , albeit less detailed , information about previously discovered pne without the need for additional observations and can even be used to identify previously undiscovered pne @xcite .",
    "broad spectral coverage allows one to probe large spans of the spectral energy distributions of pne and can be used in concert with spectroscopic surveys to calibrate photometric data for the study of pn emission .",
    "although this photometric information alone is not as detailed as spectroscopic data , it is sufficient to place broad constraints on the properties of the overall strength of the pn s emission lines and underlying stellar continuum for much larger populations than are accessible spectroscopically .",
    "pne are typically identified by searching for objects with bright [ ] @xmath55007 lines .",
    "traditional large area surveys use the difference of on- and off - band narrowband photometry to select pn candidates which are then followed up spectroscopically to exclude regions and wolf - rayet stars , which also emit strong [ ] lines .",
    "ground based spectroscopy is limited to only the brightest pne and restricted by atmospheric windows . for the m06 survey , spectroscopic follow up",
    "was replaced by cuts of extended objects and objects with low @xmath6 ratios measured from narrowband imaging from the local group survey ( lgs ) @xcite . while this method provided a deeper and larger survey without the need for spectroscopic follow - up , it is also subject to more contamination .",
    "high resolution imaging provides a cleaner view of the sources of the [ ] emission , improving rejection of non - pn sources , particularly extended regions which are the dominant contaminating object in pn surveys .    in section  [ data ] of this paper",
    "we describe how we identified pne in the phat catalog by cross - identification with m06 . in section  [ results ]",
    "we present the phat pne catalog and characterize basic uv , optical , and nir photometric properties of pne .",
    "we discuss our results in section  [ discussion ] and summarize them in section  [ summary ] .",
    "the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury ( phat ) is a hubble space telescope ( hst ) multi cycle imaging survey covering roughly 1/3 of m31 s star forming disk out to 20 kpc @xcite .",
    "observations were made with hst using the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) and wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) with six filters spanning the ultraviolet ( wfc3/uvis f275w and f336w ) , the optical ( acs / wfc f475w and f814w ) , and the near - infrared ( wfc3/ir f110w and f160w ) .",
    "all data files are publicly available and described at http://archive.stsci.edu / prepds / phat/. for full details of the data acquisition and analysis , see @xcite .",
    "briefly , photometry was reduced using the dolphot 1.2 @xcite software package which uses iterative point spread function ( psf)-fitting photometry on neighbor - subtracted images to fit the sky and psf simultaneously .",
    "this process is done for each peak in a stack of images across different filters of the same camera .",
    "dolphot aligns each image in a stack using hundreds to thousands of bright stars in the field to achieve the precise alignment needed for its photometric processing .",
    "further internal astrometric alignment was performed for each camera .",
    "the cameras were then aligned with each other and with a global reference frame .",
    "the reference frame was provided by archival @xmath7 data from megacam cfht .",
    "the error in acs / wfc to cfht alignment is @xmath2 and the relative error in alignment across the three cameras is @xmath8 .",
    "cross identification with m06 is therefore limited by the astrometric accuracy of m06  reported to be @xmath9 and @xmath10 in ra and dec respectively .",
    "we avoided restricting our search to the phat point source catalogs .",
    "rather , we cross identified pne using the acs `` '' files produced by dolphot .",
    "we used these raw dolphot output files which contain sources that may poorly fit the psf so as not to exclude any extended pne .",
    "phat is a multi - release program that is still in progress .",
    "this paper covers only the phat data available at the time the work for this paper was done .",
    "phat consists of a total of 23 bricks , each containing 18 hst pointings .",
    "this paper covers only bricks 2 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 8 , 9 , 12 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 21 , 22 , and 23 .",
    "brick 1 was excluded from this paper , though currently available , due to heavy crowding effects that made it difficult to identify pne in the inner regions of m31 .",
    "all pne analyzed in this paper were originally identified as part of the m06 deep kinematic survey of m31 , which covered m31 s disk out to a radius of 2@xmath11 ( 27.4 kpc ) .",
    "m06 identified 2615 likely pne down to a reported completeness of @xmath12 for the [ ] @xmath55007 line .",
    "of these 2615 , 711 are in the current phat footprint .",
    "individual pn candidates have reported uncertainties in their @xmath13 measurements of 0.07 mag and in their ra and dec measurements of @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively .",
    "we cross identified sources in the m06 catalog with photometric data from phat .      figure  [ throughput ] shows throughput curves for each of the phat filters overlaid on a model pn spectrum .",
    "the bandpasses of the two uv filters , f275w and f336w , overlie many weak emission lines together with a significant stellar and nebular continuum .",
    "the majority of nebular emission line flux falls under the bandpass of the f475w filter , namely the strong emission lines : [ ] @xmath55007 , [ ] @xmath54959 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , f475w flux is due largely to nebular emission lines .",
    "the f814w bandpass overlies a few weak emission lines , though the majority of flux in f814w is likely due to stellar and paschen continuum .",
    "a few weak emission lines also fall under the f110w bandpass , which could have a significant or dominant contribution to the total flux given the weaker underlying stellar continuum in the nir .",
    "flux in f160w , however , is most likely entirely due to continuum from the central star as there are no emission lines that could have a significant contribution to the total f160w flux . table [ fluxtable ] lists likely main contributors of pne flux in each of the phat filters .",
    "the vast majority of pn emission line flux within the phat spectral range falls in the f475w bandpass .",
    "thus , most pne have unusual colors , particularly in three - color images where f475w drives the green channel .",
    "figure  [ pnpostage ] shows f814w : f475w : f336w r : g : b images in which pne appear anomalously blue - green , making them easy to visually differentiate from surrounding stars .",
    "we generated equivalent images for all the phat data and used them to visually identify pne , as described in the following section .",
    "to assess the relative positional accuracy of the m06 and phat catalogs , we performed an initial visual search for anomalously blue - green objects within 3 times the @xmath16 uncertainties of the m06 reported positions .",
    "we found likely optical counterparts as far as @xmath17 from their cataloged position .",
    "we therefore adopted @xmath18 ( 11 pc at the distance of m31 ) as a search radius .",
    "there are , on average , @xmath0600 objects in phat within @xmath18 of an m06 pn location .",
    "we , therefore , require additional constraints to identify the phat counterpart .",
    "we first take advantage of the fact that there is a strong linear relation between the quoted m06 @xmath13 magnitude and the phat f475w magnitude , since the majority of f475w flux is due to the [ ] @xmath55007 line .",
    "we show this relation in figure  [ m5007vf475w ] for the final catalog .",
    "a linear fit to this relation finds @xmath19 .",
    "in addition to magnitude , we also considered cross - identifying sources based on optical color , positional offset from m06 , and the `` '' and `` '' of the psf .",
    "the most distinguishing identification parameters were optical color and the expected f475w magnitude estimated from the m06 @xmath13 magnitude .",
    "the round and sharp psf values from phat s photometry were used mainly to weed out artifacts and spurious objects such as cosmic rays from the uncut `` '' files .    to automatically select candidates on the basis of the above parameters",
    ", we used an initial training set of visually identified pne .",
    "we calculated the average value and @xmath16 spread of each identification parameter ( expected f475w , optical color , positional offset from m06 , sharpness , and roundness ) . for each object in phat within @xmath18 of an m06 pn location , the differences between the training set s and the object s parameter values were normalized by the @xmath16 spreads of the parameter values and then averaged over all parameters giving double the weight to the optical color and estimated f475w magnitude .",
    "the resulting value , noted as @xmath20 , is the object s standard score of the deviation from typical pne identified in phat .",
    "objects with @xmath21 are highly probable pn candidates",
    ". objects with @xmath22 are probable pn candidates",
    ". objects with @xmath23 are possible pn candidates . eqs .",
    "[ zscore ] and [ zpn ] define @xmath20 where , for parameter @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the object s value , @xmath26 is the training set s average value , and @xmath27 is the @xmath16 spread .",
    "@xmath28    we attempted to identify new pne in m31 using the optical color and f475w magnitude space occupied by the m06 pne .",
    "we looked for [ ] emission in the lgs [ ] images @xcite to confirm these candidate pne .",
    "none of these candidates had measurable [ ] emission .",
    "therefore , this attempt did not result in the identification of any new pne , suggesting m06 is complete to the lgs [ ] detection limit .",
    "an earlier attempt to photometrically identify new pne in phat was made by selecting sources in the bulge of m31 with @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and no matching source in the literature .",
    "spectroscopic follow - up of 16 of these candidates found that 7 showed emission lines indicative of pne .",
    "a larger campaign could lead to the discovery of pne in the inner regions of m31 , where previous surveys suffered extreme crowding .",
    "finally , all catalogs and figures presented contain only photometric measurements with a signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) greater than 4 .",
    "this snr cut , which is necessary to ensure only accurate , high - quality measurements are analyzed , resulted in the culling of 120 f275w measurements , 2 f336w measurements , 1 f814w measurement , and 29 f160w measurements .      to aid in the assessment of our automatic selection method ,",
    "a visual catalog was created containing a phat 3-color image , phat optical cmd , lgs [ ] image , and lgs v - band image @xcite , for each m06 pn location that phat overlaps .",
    "the three objects with the lowest @xmath20 were marked in the phat image and cmd .",
    "a final pne catalog was created using the one probable candidate in fields where there was only one probable candidate , and the bluest of the candidates with the three lowest @xmath20 in the cases where there were multiple probable candidates or no probable candidates .",
    "this final catalog of 467 pne is presented in section  [ results ] .",
    "the visual catalog also allowed for the quick identification of possible misidentifications in the m06 catalog .",
    "locations where there was no probable pn candidate in phat and resolved nebulosity in either the phat image or in the lgs [ ] image were marked as probable regions .",
    "locations where there was no probable pn candidate in phat , no obvious nebulosity , clear v - band detection , and a single bright main sequence star present in the cmd with f475w much brighter than expected from @xmath13 were marked as possible stellar emission line sources , many of which may be wolf - rayet stars .",
    "both regions and wr stars can have strong [ ] @xmath55007 lines , and could have been detected by m06 as [ ] emission objects .",
    "the left two panels of figure  [ nonpnpostage ] show phat images of likely m06 misidentifications - one marked as an region , the other as a stellar source .",
    "a catalog of these possible misidentifications is presented in section  [ results ] .",
    "of the 711 pne in the m06 catalog that overlap the phat images , 152 were likely misidentified .",
    "there were 92 cases where there were no possible pn candidates ( @xmath31 ) and no obvious source of misidentification in the phat or lgs images .",
    "the frequency of these cases is much higher for fainter m06 pne . for m06 pne with @xmath13 @xmath32",
    "25 mag , over half were found to have no pn candidate in phat and no source of misidentification .",

    "figure  [ maps ] shows the spatial distribution of pne in the phat footprint as well as the locations of possibly misidentified m06 sources .",
    "the density of pn sources falls of radially , tracing the old stellar population .",
    "sources tagged as extended regions or other non - pn stellar sources are consistently found near regions of recent and on - going star formation along the disk characterized by high uv flux .",
    "non - pn objects were selected without prior knowledge of their location .",
    "table  [ pnetable ] provides astrometric and photometric measurements in six filters ranging from near - ir to near - uv for 467 pne in the footprint of the current phat release .",
    "of the 467 pne in the catalog , 291 have an f275w measurement , 409 have an f336w measurement , 467 have an f475w measurement , 466 have an f814w measurement , 185 have an f110w measurement , and 156 have an f160w measurement .    tables  [ hiitable ]  &  [ sttable ] list m06 pne for which we found a possible source of misidentification .",

    "astrometry and photometry for stellar sources are included when available . of these non - pn sources , our classifications for 38 sources",
    "agree with spectroscopic classification from @xcite .",

    "the same formula can be applied to apparent magnitude when the distances to the pne are roughly equivalent , as is the case with m31 .",
    "the upper half of figure  [ pnlf ] shows the pnlf of the phat pne catalog using the m06 @xmath13 .",
    "the phat @xmath13 pnlf matches the expected form up to @xmath024th magnitude , consistent with the m06 reported completeness of 23.75 .",
    "the apparent magnitude bright - end cut off of the phat @xmath13 pnlf is @xmath35 , which agrees well with the m06 value of @xmath36 and the @xcite value of @xmath37 .",

    "there is a slight offset in the apparent magnitude bright - end cut - off between the @xmath13 and f475w pnlf and the fainter portion of the f475w pnlf appears flatter . assuming the f475w pnlf is of the same form as the @xmath13 pnlf , the apparent magnitude bright - end cut - off of the phat f475w pnlf is @xmath38 . assuming a distance modulus of @xmath39 ( corresponding to a distance of @xmath40 kpc ) @xcite , the absolute magnitude bright - end cut off of the phat f475w pnlf is @xmath41 .",
    "we now describe the distribution of pne in phat cmds ; in section  [ evo ] we discuss the evolution of pne through the cmds .",
    "an optical cmd of pne compared with nearby stars ( figure  [ opticalcmd ] ) confirms previous expectations that most pne exist in a very blue portion of the cmd where not many stars are expected to be found . in general , pne are distinctly brighter and bluer than neighboring stars ( @xmath423@xmath43 ) as expected from their emission - line dominated spectrum ; however , there is a population of pne that overlap with main sequence stars in figure  [ opticalcmd ] .",
    "pne exist in a distinct region of the optical cmd as outlined by the parallelogram in figure  [ opticalcmd ] , with hand - drawn boundaries @xmath44 and @xmath45 , containing 95% of our pne sample .",
    "[ [ uv ] ] uv ^^    over @xmath46 of pne in the phat catalog have detections in f336w and @xmath47 have detections in    both uv filters .",
    "the left side of figure  [ filterscmd ] shows the locations on the optical cmd of pne with and without uv detections .",
    "uv detection is much more common among pne that are bright in f475w , as would be expected for flux due to stellar continuum with some contribution from emission lines .",
    "uv detection is also slightly more common among bluer pne , as the brightest pne also tend to be the bluest .",
    "figure  [ uvcmd ] shows the uv cmd of the pne with detections in both uv filters .",
    "pne tend to be brighter and redder in the uv than other stars within @xmath18 .",
    "however , these neighboring stars are dominated by ms stars and there is only a slight color difference between pne and the population of hot ms stars , as would be expected from the assumption that uv flux of pne comes from the very hot central star .",
    "the brightest pne have well constrained colors , while the spread in color increases for fainter f275w magnitudes which tend to be the noisiest measurements in the phat filter set .      over @xmath48 of pne in our catalog",
    "have detections in both nir filters .",
    "nearly all pne with    detections in the nir also have detection in f336w , @xmath49 of which have detections in both uv    filters .",
    "thus , any pn bright enough to be detected in the nir is almost certainly also detected in the uv , where proportionally more of the pn s bolometric flux is emitted .",
    "the right side of figure  [ filterscmd ] shows the locations on the optical cmd of pne with and without nir detections .",
    "similar to the uv , nir detection is much more common among pne that are bright in f475w .",
    "however , the optical color distribution of pne with detections in nir is relatively flat and distinctly different from the optical color distribution of all pne .",
    "figure  [ ircmd ] shows the nir cmd of the pne with detections in both nir filters .",
    "pne are distinctly bluer and brighter in the nir than stars around them , which are primarily cool rgb and agb stars .",
    "their distinct color in the nir is due to the few emission lines in f110w and the lack of emission lines in f160w .",
    "there are two nir - bright pne in the phat catalog with @xmath50 that are separate from the rest of the pne population .",
    "it is likely that the pn in each case is coincident with an nir - bright source .",
    "pne are indeed unique in their photometric signal across all of phat s six bands  particularly their optical and nir color .",
    "however , their most distinguishing feature by far is a booming f475w signal best probed by f475w - f814w color . like in f475w",
    ", emission lines in f110w add additional flux that give pne distinct nir colors .",
    "however , as seen in figure  [ optirccd ] , pne are best secluded by their optical color .",
    "any diagnostic that used multiple bands to identify pne would necessarily have most of its weight on f475w , as this is where the ratio of line emission to stellar continuum is largest ( see section  [ sedsect ] ) .      since pne are emission line objects , we assume the majority of f475w flux is from emission lines , allowing us to estimate line flux ratios from the difference between the f475w and @xmath13 magnitudes .",
    "as seen in figure  [ throughput ] , the three strongest emission lines that fall under f475w are [ ] @xmath55007 , [ ] @xmath54959 , and @xmath14 . because the [ ] @xmath55007 to [ ] @xmath54959 ratio is nearly constant for all pne , differences in the @xmath51 color of our pne are largely due to differences in the [ ] to @xmath14 ratio .",
    "this ratio is a measure of ionization in the nebula and , in general , is expected to be large when the central star is very hot .    to explore the possibility of using @xmath52 as a probe of the [ ] @xmath53 emission line ratio , we used data from @xcite , who have published spectral line ratio measurements for several pne in m31 , 69 of which are in the phat catalog and have both @xmath14 and [ ] @xmath55007 measurements .",
    "figure  [ ec ] shows the relation between @xmath52 and the [ ] to @xmath14 ratio , @xmath54 .",
    "the large spread of the relation is likely due to differences in the underlying stellar continuum which can significantly contribute to the total f475w flux when line emission is comparatively weak .",
    "however , a relation between the relative @xmath52 and @xmath54 exists . for low values of @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) ,",
    "i.e. comparatively strong @xmath14 lines , the relation is quite strong , such that pne with lower @xmath54 values have brighter f475w magnitudes in relation to their @xmath13 magnitudes . at higher values of @xmath54 ,",
    "i.e. comparatively weak @xmath14 lines , the relation saturates as the contribution of @xmath14 to the total flux becomes indistinguishable from the continuum and weaker emission lines .",
    "therefore , estimates of @xmath54 can only be made for pne with @xmath56 .",
    "estimates of the @xmath54 ratio can be made for 170 of the 467 pne in the phat catalog using equation  [ oiiihbeq ] .",
    "@xmath57    the ratio @xmath54 has been used to calculate the excitation classification ( ec ) of low ec pne ( @xmath58 ) @xcite .",
    "we adopt the @xmath59 method from @xcite for calculating the ec of low ec pne as defined in equation  [ eceq ] .",
    "@xmath60 ec estimates for the 170 pne with @xmath56 are included in table  [ pnetable ] with an uncertainty of @xmath61 .",
    "all pne with @xmath62 are assumed to have ec @xmath63 . as excitation increases , the contributions of other emission lines such as become comparable with @xmath14 which would cause an underestimate in the pn s ec .",
    "m31 is known to be a dusty galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* dalcanton et al . 2014 , submitted ) . therefore , we need to understand how dust may be affecting our pne photometry . to determine the degree to which the pne sample is attenuated by extinction , we selected a subsample of pne from `` dust - free '' regions as determined from the extinction maps of dalcanton et al .",
    "2014 ( submitted ) .",
    "these pne were selected to be in regions with a@xmath640.5 and a low fraction of reddened stars .",
    "their optical cmd is shown in figure  [ lowav ] , and the distribution is qualitatively equivalent to that of the full sample . perhaps",
    "because pne tend not to be associated with ongoing star formation or because pne are associated with old stars ( @xmath32 1 gyr ) that have migrated out of the galactic plane , our pne photometry appears to be relatively unaffected by dust extinction .",
    "the consistency of the phat @xmath13 pnlf with the m06 pnlf suggests that the phat pne catalog is a representative and unbiased subset of the m06 catalog . despite the fact that the f475w bandpass covers emission lines other than [ ] @xmath55007 and",
    "continuum from the central star , the phat f475w pnlf is similar in form to the @xmath13 pnlf , particularly on the bright - end  aside from a slight offset .",
    "this is because the contribution by stellar continuum and weaker emission lines to the total f475w flux is less significant in brighter pne , for which the f475w magnitude is a good indicator of @xmath13 , making the f475w pnlf a possible proxy for the traditional @xmath13 pnlf for future extragalactic surveys .",
    "the flatness of the faint - end of the phat f475w pnlf could be due to the larger relative contribution by stellar continuum for pne with weaker [ ] emission .",
    "excitation classification has been found to depend on the evolutionary state of a pn , which is reflected in the central star s effective temperature , the pn s radius , and the pn s expansion velocity @xcite .",
    "because many parameters affect the ec , the correlations between ec and physical properties of pne have large scatter which , coupled with the large uncertainties of our own ec estimates , means we can not reliably estimate individual parameters .",
    "however , our ability to isolate a subsample of low ec pne allows us to place some pne in the evolutionarily young phase with small sizes and low central star temperatures . for the remainder of this paper",
    ", we referred to pne with ec below the upper limit of our ability to determine ec ( @xmath65 ) as low ec pne and all other pne as medium to high ec pne ; note that the canonical definition of `` low ec '' includes up to an ec of 5 .",
    "we do expect some cross contamination due to the large uncertainties in our @xmath66 measurements such that some pne in our sample of low ec pne are in fact medium to high ec pne and vice versa .",
    "in addition , some high ec pne may be misclassified as low ec pne due to increased contribution of and other weak lines in the f475w bandpass .    according to pn evolutionary tracks based on photoionization models described in @xcite and @xcite , all pne , regardless of their initial mass , begin as low ec pne .",
    "they then increase in ec as they evolve to a mass - dependent maximum ec before returning to a slightly lower ec .",
    "only lower mass pne ( central star stellar mass @xmath670.6@xmath68 ) are expected to return to an ec lower than 5 .",
    "the majority of low ec pne in our catalog are therefore likely to be young , but with a wide range of initial masses .",
    "additionally , high ec pne in our catalog are expected to cover the entire range of pne ages except for the youngest .",
    "another set of pn evolutionary models useful for understanding how pne evolve through phat color - magnitude and color - color diagrams are 1d radiation - hydrodynamic models that describe the evolution of pne by modeling a circumstellar envelope along with the central star as it evolves from the agb toward the white - dwarf cooling path @xcite",
    ". studies of the emission properties of these models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) explain that in early stages of evolution , pne increase in @xmath13 brightness as they increase in ec until they reach a maximum @xmath13 brightness .",
    "the intensity and duration of maximum m5007 brightness is mass - dependent . in general",
    ", higher mass progenitors result in brighter maximum m5007 but for shorter duration than fainter low mass progenitors .",
    "maximum @xmath13 brightness is reached at ecs higher than the upper limit of our ability to determine ec of pne in phat .",
    "therefore , we expect the pne in our catalog to evolve from low ec to high ec simultaneously increasing in @xmath13 brightness to a maximum brightness . indeed , this is the qualitative behavior observed in figure  [ opticalcmdec ] , as described below .",
    "figure  [ opticalcmdec ] shows the locations of low ec and medium to high ec pne on an optical cmd .",
    "we see a bifurcation of low ec and medium to high ec pne among pne with f475w @xmath69",
    ". this behavior would be consistent with the evolutionary transition of a high mass progenitor along , or parallel to , side 1 ( the upper boundary in the figure ) as the pn s [ ] @xmath55007 flux reaches a maximum .",
    "the proposed transition aligns well with the pn evolutionary models described above , namely a transition from low ec to higher ec and from fainter f475w magnitudes to the brightest .",
    "brightening in f475w along side 1 toward the bluer portion of the cmd corresponds to evolution with a constant f814w magnitude .",
    "the less distinct red boundary indicated by side 2 in figure  [ opticalcmdec ] is made up of mostly low ec pne and overlaps main sequence stars .",
    "the overlap with the main sequence is most likely due to interstellar reddening of young pne but could also indicate residual contamination from wr stars .",
    "the faint boundary ( side 3 ) and the similar boundary for field stars are products of the cuts in signal - to - noise .",
    "figure  [ uvcmdec ] shows the locations of low ec and medium to high ec pne on a uv cmd .",
    "the low ec pne are systematically brighter and bluer , suggesting some transition toward redder and fainter uv magnitudes as they evolve into higher ecs .",
    "the slightly redder extant of the pn distribution compared to bright ms stars is likely due to increased contribution from nebular continuum in the f336w bandpass . also shown in figure  [ uvcmdec ] are two post - agb ( p - agb ) evolutionary tracks from @xcite converted to wfc3/uvis photometry as described in @xcite , shown without extinction correction .",
    "we see an increased spread of uv color at fainter f275w magnitudes , but it is hard to say for certain if the spread represents the true spread in pne uv color , or is due to photometric uncertainty and/or interstellar reddening .",
    "still , it is clear that reduced uv flux is a prominent difference between low ec and medium to high ec pne on the uv cmd .",
    "such a transition is expected from p - agb evolutionary tracks .",
    "figure  [ uvoptcmdec ] shows the cmd for f336w - f475w vs f336w .",
    "because f336w is dominated by stellar and nebular continuum and f475w by line emission , this diagram compares emission line flux to underlying continuum .",
    "low ec pne appear much like hot stars , but medium to high ec pne show up where few stars are expected to be found .",
    "the increased excitation increases flux in the emission line - dominated f475w bandpass , pulling pne redward to a relatively unpopulated portion of the cmd .",
    "this diagnostic may be useful for future studies of pne as it is possible to replicate through ground - based observations .",
    "of the six phat filters , pne are brightest in f336w and f475w .    in the nir",
    "there is no separation in either color or magnitude between low ec and medium to high ec pne .",
    "ms stars in phat are expected to have nir colors redder than @xmath70 , with only younger ms stars ( @xmath42 100 myr ) expected to have bluer colors at @xmath7123 .",
    "the lack of young ms stars neighboring pne ( figure  [ ircmd ] ) emphasizes that pne are not sampling regions with very recent star formation",
    ".      for pne with detections in all six phat filters , converting from magnitude to total flux produces spectral energy distributions ( seds ) covering 0.3 to 1.6 microns .",
    "such seds will provide constraints for future models of pne evolution .",
    "such models will be necessary to reliably constrain extinction for these pne .",
    "figure  [ seds ] shows seds for 130 pne with detections in all six filters .",
    "the right column of figure  [ seds ] shows seds grouped by @xmath13 .",
    "seds of the brightest pne are largely uniform while seds of fainter pne show more variations .",
    "the seds look much like those of hot stars with the addition of a prominent peaks at 0.475 and 1.1 microns due to emission lines in the bandpasses .",
    "however , unlike hot stars , flux at 0.336 microns exceeds flux at 0.275 microns for many pne .",
    "this could be due to the fact that 0.275 micron flux is more attenuated by extinction , combined with the larger uncertainties in 0.275 micron flux .",
    "the left column of figure  [ seds ] shows seds grouped by ec . at the lowest ec ,",
    "the seds show little evidence of emission line flux above the blue stellar continuum . moving through higher ec ,",
    "the emission line features become much more prominent .",
    "again , this suggests low ec pne are largely young pne with the lowest ec pne being just beyond the emergence of [ ] lines , which grow stronger as pne evolve to higher ec .",
    "the two anomalously nir - bright pne also show up in the seds .",
    "again , it is likely they are crowded by a nir - bright source .",
    "pne are commonly found to have radii on the order of 0.1 pc but have been known to have radii as large as 0.6 pc @xcite .",
    "it might be expected that pne with radii @xmath320.5 pc could be resolved in phat considering hst s acs camera has a plate scale of @xmath2/pixel ( 0.2 pc / pixel at the distance of m31 ) and the average full width at half max ( fwhm ) of phat s psf is @xmath02 pixels . however , as pne evolve they both expand radially and drop in luminosity , resulting in a steep decline of surface brightness .",
    "pne large enough to be resolved in phat are likely too faint to be detected in phat . at intermediate stages of evolution , however , some pne may be bright enough to be detected in phat and large enough to be slightly resolved .",
    "figure  [ fwhm ] shows the dependence of fwhm on magnitude in phat data .",
    "faint sources in crowded regions suffer heavy blending that can cause the direct fwhm measurement to overestimate the true fwhm .",
    "however , the fwhm distribution of pne is indistinguishable from that of nearby stars , suggesting that pne are not resolved in phat .    in general",
    ", the pne sample does not appear any more extended than nearby stars , however , we found one pn ( m06 143 ) that appeared significantly larger than the surrounding stars .",
    "we show an image of this pn in figure  [ 143 ] .",
    "this pn has a fwhm of @xmath04 pixels , compared to stars in the area , which have fwhms of @xmath02 pixels .",
    "after accounting for the effects of a @xmath72 fwhm point spread function , the intrinsic radius of the pn would be up to @xmath73 , or 0.3@xmath740.4 pc .",
    "the phat magnitudes of m06 143 are likely underestimated due to the extended nature of the psf .",
    "this is supported by the fact that m06 143 is the faintest pn in our sample , with @xmath75 , and has @xmath76  the largest difference of the pne sample and more than three times the @xmath52 saturation limit of the pne sample .",
    "though the optical color of m06 143 is consistent with pne in phat , we can not rule out the possibility it is a blended source or a non - pn source .",
    "finally , any m06 source that was visually resolved in phat was rejected as being a pn ( m06 143 is the only marginally extended pn ) and classified as a possible region . therefore , inclusion in table  [ hiitable ] serves as an updated classification of extended objects in m06 , which will be more reliable than such classifications from the ground - based data .",
    "we have identified 467 pne in the phat survey photometry catalogs .",
    "the f475w broadband magnitudes show a tight correlation with the @xmath13 magnitudes clearly indicating the purity of our sample .",
    "these pne are unresolved and dominated by [ ] line emission .",
    "since the phat astrometric solution is precise to @xmath8 , we have provided improved astrometry for all of the pne in our sample , along with 6-band photometry from the phat survey .",
    "comparing our broadband magnitudes and m06 narrowband magnitudes to excitation classifications from optical spectroscopy in the literature shows that low excitation pne tend to have bluer colors in f475w-@xmath13 , suggesting that our broadband magnitudes in these cases probe the emission from the central star .",
    "these results indicate that our seds will be useful for constraining models of pne and central star evolution .",
    "the size distribution of pne in our hst images are consistent with that of point sources . however , there is some evidence that at least one pn is marginally resolved , corresponding to a physical radius of up to 0.3@xmath740.4 pc .",
