    "calibration as per the prescription is carried out on a per - spw basis and almost always failed for many of these spws .",

    "once all the e4 observations were complete , the images were combined using the aips task _ comb _ to make a final e4 mosaic .",
    "this mosaic was used to carry out a deeper variability and transient search with respect to epoch e2 , the first survey , and the vla - stripe 82 survey (  [ sec : radio_transients ] ) .",
    "since computing time required for the various stages of data processing and transient search are critical for any near - real - time search , we briefly describe this aspect here .",
    "data i / o is the rate - determining factor in our near - real - time data processing . as a result ,",
    "the processing time is a strong function of the percentage of free disk space on the nrao lustre file system at socorro which hosted the data - processing for our survey .",
    "for the first three epochs , the lustre had 75% free disk space , and the calibration , imaging , cataloging and transient search for each observing block , covering 25 deg@xmath1 over 485 pointings or scans and amounting to 250 gb of visibility data , required about 4.5 hours , 0.5 hours , 0.5 hours , and 0.5 hours respectively .",
    "thus , we were able to detect transient candidates within six hours from the completion of observations .",
    "this fast turnaround allowed same - night triggering of optical follow - up and also rapid broadband radio follow - up , which are crucial for understanding transients that evolve on relatively short timescales . for the fourth epoch ,",
    "the lustre had 1520% free disk space and imaging problem was much more lengthy owing to the 2025 scans to be imaged . the calibration and imaging for each observing block within e4 , which had 250 gb of visibility data and covered a 22.5 deg@xmath1 area on the sky , required 12 hours and 3 hours respectively , while the transient search was completed in 1 hour .      during the near - real - time processing , the data editing and source identification (  [ sec : radio_processing : nrt ] )",
    "was not done optimally in order to enable rapid follow - up of interesting radio transient candidates . also , some problems with a small subset of the data were discovered after the near - real - time processing .",
    "specifically , 1 ) the automated rfi algorithm and manual flagging likely excised both terrestrial interference and valid astronomical data , 2 ) the gain calibration for several pointings was affected by strong satellite signals , and 3 ) a subset the initial calibrated data suffered from a systematic phase distortion (  [ sec : radio_processing : final : imaging ] ) .",
    "thus , following the completion of the observing epochs e1 , e2 and e3 , we carried out a more detailed processing of the raw data using casa .",
    "epoch e4 was not subjected to final detailed processing ; calibrated data from the near - real - time processing was directly used for analysis .",
    "the final calibration was carried out using the nrao calibration pipeline ( pipeline version 1.2.0 implemented in casa 4.1 ) , modified to accommodate manual flagging and additional calibration diagnostic plots , and to bypass hanning smoothing .",
    "the calibration was done with two iterative runs of the pipeline .",
    "diagnostic plots for the flux and gain calibrators ( plots of the gain calibration tables and calibrated phases and amplitudes ) from the initial run were used to determine visibilities with incorrect amplitude and/or phase calibration or bad calibrator data .",
    "antenna- , baseline- , correlation- , spw- , and time - based manual flagging of the flux and gain calibrators was incorporated in the second run to remove these visibilities .",
    "especially , five spws having frequencies between 2.122.38 ghz and 3.624.00 ghz , for which the amplitude and phase calibration failed in most instances , were manually flagged before calibration .",
    "after the second iteration of the nrao calibration pipeline followed by imaging , two issues persisted : 1 ) the amplitude gain solutions were not stable as a function of time likely due to rfi - induced non - linearities in the signal chain ( see  [ sec : radio_processing : final : rfi ] ) , and 2 ) y - shaped imaging artifact in the first 95 scans of the 24jul2012 epoch , indicating bad raw phase data for the gain calibrator ( see  [ sec : radio_processing : final : imaging ] ) .      since stripe 82 is close to the clarke belt , radio observations are prone to severe rfi from satellites in geostationary and geosynchronous ( gso ) orbits .",
    "the rfi in the frequency range 3.624.00 ghz is low - level in amplitude , but it distorts the phase information quite significantly .",
    "those data that are irreparably affected are flagged for our final reduction .",
    "gso satellites seen by the jansky vla have not been individually characterized in terms of downlink frequencies and polarizations , and our target data could potentially be affected .",
    "the derived calibration also shows instability in the form of sporadically varying amplitude gains from the gain calibrator .",
    "this effect is pronounced in those gain calibrator scans that are severely affected by rfi . in epochs",
    "e1 , e2 and e3 , where the observations were carried out over the same lst range (  [ sec : survey : radio_observations ] ) , the aberration in gain is reproducible within a specific lst range .",
    "this suggests that the aberrant amplitude gains occur at a particular range of azimuth : between 124  and 255  for region r1",
    "( j2212 + 0152 used as gain calibrator ) and between 135  and 220  for region r2 ( gain calibrator j2323 - 0317 ) .",
    "the scans of the southern calibrator , j2323 - 0317 , are more severely affected than those of j2212 + 0152 due to the proximity of the former to the clarke belt .",
    "the upper panel of figure  [ fig : gainamp ]   shows the normalized gain amplitudes for j2323 - 0317 and the normalized rms noise in the target pointings as a function of the observing scan number ( as a proxy for time ) .",
    "it is evident that the amplitude gains are correlated with the rms noise of the target pointings , suggestive of anomalous gain values .",
    "our analysis of the calibrated data is complicated by the fact that , although the rfi is localized to typically a single spw , amplitude gains in spws that are free from rfi are also significantly affected ( irrespective of the baseband in which the rfi is present ; lower panel of figure  [ fig : gainamp ] ) .",
    "we refer to this as `` gain compression '' .",
    "the `` compression '' signifies that the amplitude gain values are reduced with respect to their true values and result in increased rms noise in the target fields .",
    "initial assessment attributes the aberrant gains with non - linearities in the amplification stage in the analog signal chain somewhere upstream from the correlator caused by the the high power of the satellite signals .",
    "however , this hypothesis has not been thoroughly tested .",
    "we devised a fix for the gain compression in the gain calibrator scans by altering the amplitude gain calibration table generated by the nrao calibration pipeline . towards the end of each epoch",

    "the spread in the baseline - based amplitude gains in the stable time duration is @xmath200.05 , and hence we estimate that this correction will affect the true amplitudes of the target sources by @xmath205% . _",
    "given that gain calibrators in the vicinity of the clarke belt are susceptible to gain compression , we have avoided using such gain calibrators for the final cnss survey .",
    "_ accordingly , there is no indication of severe gain compression in the gain calibrator scans from epoch e4 .",
    "while the gain compression in the gain calibrator scans has a relatively straightforward workaround , the effect of gain compression on the target pointings , if present , is much more challenging to deduce .",
    "we investigate the possible issue of gain compression in target fields in  [ sec : radio_transients ] .",
    "after calibration of the data using the nrao pipeline , we clipped the visibility amplitudes of all spws in the manner described in  [ sec : radio_processing : nrt ] .",
    "we then derived and applied a single - round phase - only self calibration solution to every pointing containing a source brighter than 10 mjy in the near - real - time image .",
    "the model for the self calibration was constructed by making a preliminary image with 100 clean iterations using the casa task _ clean_. self calibration solutions were allowed to break at spectral window and scan boundaries .",
    "each self calibrated pointing was then imaged by cleaning within the 1% power point of the primary beam of the lowest frequency , 2.0 ghz , using natural weighting in the _ clean _ task in casa , choosing a cellsize of 0.6 , and 500 clean iterations to minimize clean bias . a single taylor term ( @xmath61 )",

    "epoch , the first 1.5 hours of observations have been affected by a systematic phase distortion .",
    "about 80 target pointings and six phase calibrator ( j2212 + 0152 ) scans have been thus affected .",
    "when the calibrated data is imaged , the phase distortion manifests as a three - pronged artifact such that point sources appear extended along three axes characteristic of the y - shape of the vla configuration ( left panel of figure  [ fig : y ] ) .",
    "we looked at the phase gain solutions per antenna derived from one of the affected phase calibrator scans and plotted it as a function of x- and y - positions ( east - west and north - south ) of the respective antennas in the array .",
    "the center of the array has higher gain phase ( degrees ) than the arms , and along the arms , it decreases monotonically , in general .",
    "this is equivalent to a bowl - shaped or lenticular phase screen above the array .",
    "the exact cause of the phase distortion is unknown , but it may arise due to rfi , unfavorable weather , the ionosphere , or some internal error in the antenna phase recording .",
    "while the true phases can be restored through self calibration , not all our affected pointings have bright sources to facilitate this .",

    "we are thus probing variability on all timescales that are approximately larger than the duration of each observation ( 40 seconds per pointing in our case ) but less than the separation between the two epochs being compared . accordingly , in the text below , we refer to a transient search on a `` timescale of x days '' synonymously with ",

    "it turned out that the ptf data were not very useful for this purpose . as we show in  [ sec : optical_properties ] , there is little overlap between variable radio sources and sources that vary in the optical , and almost all these jointly variable sources are agn .",
    "optical spectra from the sdss boss program @xcite were especially useful in filtering our list of candidates .",
    "in general , for those radio transients having boss spectra , we filtered out sources showing agn features in their optical spectra .",
    "wise colors were also used to eliminate possible agn .",
    "preference was given to sources that are undetected in archival radio data .",
    "we also compared our catalogs with those from past surveys at 1.4 ghz , viz .",
    "first @xcite and vla - stripe 82 @xcite , and selected @xmath010 point sources with implied spectral indices more than 2.5 or less than -2.5 between 3 ghz and 1.4 ghz .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which evolve on a timescale of years .",
    "however , most of these candidates turned out to be either gps sources or flaring agn ( see below ) .",
    "our final list of candidates for follow - up consisted of 20 objects that displayed a factor of two or more fractional variability between any two epochs , or were new bright sources compared with previous surveys at 1.4 ghz .      after correcting for the aberrant complex gains during the final data processing (  [ sec : radio_processing : final ] ) , we carried out a careful search for variables and transients bearing in mind the possibility of gain compression (  [ sec : radio_processing : final : rfi ] ) in the target fields . to maintain consistency during our variability and transient search , we only compared epochs e1 , e3 , and e4 with epoch e2 in order to probe variability on timescales of one month , one week , and 1.5 years respectively .",
    "note that among the first three epochs , e2 was the least affected by rfi .",
    "for each source in the psc , we calculated the statistical quantity @xmath80 using equation  [ eqn : var_2epoch ] .",
    "there appeared to be a small deviation of this statistic from the expected distribution ( student s t distribution ) .",
    "this may be a result of low - level gain compression in the target fields .",
    "although the epoch - to - epoch flux densities are not significantly discrepant , we addressed this issue by applying small , relative , corrections to the ratios of and the differences in the flux densities of sources between the two epochs being compared .",
    "for the one - week and one - month comparison , we made multiplicative corrections of 2%@xmath813% ( median value with standard deviation ) to the ratios of flux densities and additive corrections of 20 @xmath2jy @xmath81 50 @xmath2jy to the differences in the flux densities of sources in the psc .",
    "these corrections were derived for the two - epoch comparisons by plotting the ratios and differences of flux densities of sources as a function of time of observation and demanding the ratios and differences to be centered at unity and zero respectively . during the comparison between epochs e4 and e2 , we found it necessary to make two independent sets of corrections to the ratios of flux densities . in the first set ,",
    "multiplicative corrections of 3%@xmath814% were seen to be correlated with the declination of the sources .",
    "this discrepancy of flux densities in epoch e4 with respect to epoch e2 is a result of the the otf survey design and the near - real - time imaging process , and will be described in detail in cnss paper ii . in short , during the otf observations carried out for epoch e4 , the primary beam moved by 4  within every scan ; this was not accounted for in the imaging step .",
    "the resulting fractional change in flux density of a source depends on its position in the primary beam .",
    "this effect is manifested as a sinusoidal pattern when the flux density ratios are plotted as a function of source declinations .",
    "the second set of corrections consist of multiplicative corrections of 4%@xmath814% to the ratios of flux densities and may be attributed to gain compression .",
    "additive corrections of 10 @xmath2jy @xmath81 30 @xmath2jy were applied to the differences in the flux densities between epochs e4 and e2 . with the application of these small , first - order ,",
    "corrections we ensure to not over - fit the data and remove real variability in flux densities of the sources in the psc . the histograms showing the resultant distributions of the variability statistic , @xmath80 , is shown in figure  [ fig : varstat ] .",
    "it is evident that , after the corrections , @xmath80 agrees well with the student s t distribution ( however , see note on the 1.5 year distribution below ) .    , for sources in the psc . after the application of the corrections to the flux densities mentioned in ",
    "[ sec : radio_transients ] , @xmath80 agrees with the expected distribution , student s t.,width=336 ]    to determine additional sources of artificial variability , we ran further intensive tests with manual flagging and imaging .",

    "all in all , due to gain compression and other possible causes of artificial variability mentioned above , we adopt a conservative criterion for selection of our variable sources : fractional variability greater than 0.3 ( @xmath82 ) .",

    "we have found 142 sources displaying fractional variability beyond 30% . based on radio follow - up observations , radio and optical variability , radio spectral indices , and multi - wavelength archival photometric data ,",
    "almost all of these are likely to be due to shocks in agn jets .",
    "we have also found two bona fide radio transients associated with galactic objects , a flare from an rs cvn binary and a dke flare .",
    "comparison of our pilot survey data with the first and vla - stripe 82 surveys has ( unexpectedly ) revealed a few additional , highly variable and transient , sources on timescales of 520 years .",
    "these sources , most of which are either previously - known radio sources or have optical agn hosts , are likely associated with renewed agn activity .",
    "two other transients , found serendipitously , suggest that there are indeed many more transients in this dataset than the ones which we have found through our stringent selection criteria .",
    "we encourage the astronomical community to take advantage of the data from this pilot radio survey ( see  [ sec : radio_processing : final : dr ] for the data release website ) for finding these hidden transients and for other science .",
    "a high - cadence optical survey using ptf was carried out over three months , contemporaneous with the first three epochs of the radio survey .",
    "the motivation behind this joint survey was the selection of radio transients for rapid follow - up , preliminary classification of radio variables and transients based on optical light curves , and a direct comparison of the dynamic radio and optical skies .",
    "as noted by previous radio and optical studies ( see  [ sec : optical_properties ] ) , 20% of the persistent radio sources have an optical counterpart above the ptf limiting magnitude of 21 , while 50% have counterparts above the sdss limiting magnitude of 23.5 in the red filter .",
    "we have found primarily slowly - evolving radio transients , and , within the sensitivity limits of our ptf and pilot jansky vla surveys , very little overlap between the optical and radio variable skies .",
    "only 0.05% of the radio point sources and @xmath200.001% of the optical sources are variable at both frequencies .",
    "the fraction of strong variables per square degree of the radio decimetric sky is at least an order of magnitude smaller than those in the optical sky .",
    "we will now use the radio data to assess the degree of variability and the transient rate of the radio sky , and make recommendations for future surveys .",
    "we found only a small fraction ( @xmath165 ) of the point sources varying by @xmath430% on week - month - year timescales .",
    "majority of these are variable only on a 1.5 year timescale , and as described in ",
    "[ sec : radio_transients : final ] , this variability fraction is to be taken as the upper limit . several previous studies at 1.4 ghz @xcite have shown that the fraction of variables on timescales between minutes and years , and flux densities between 0.1 mjy and 100 mjy , is @xmath01% or less .",
    "similar to these studies , we see that the 3 ghz sky is not highly variable on timescales longer than a few days .",
    "radio follow - up observations , optical and radio light curves , and multi - wavelength archival data of the radio variable sources suggest that almost all of these are shock - related flaring in the jets of agn .",
    "our choice of modulation index for measuring variability and selection threshold introduces a bias towards selecting sources with large flux densities .",
    "a source in the psc would have to have a mean flux density of 1.4 mjy in order to detect a 30% fractional variability , while at the 7@xmath58 source detection limit of of @xmath00.5 mjy , a source would have to have @xmath166 ( @xmath167120% ) in order to be identified as a significant variable .",
    "fifteen strong variables ( i.e. sources having @xmath168 , or @xmath167100% ) were identified in our survey , but only 3000 sources in the psc are bright enough ( @xmath40.55 mjy ) to have been identified as a strong variable .",
    "we can therefore conclude that the fraction of strong variables is less than one percent .",
    "radio variability appears to be a function of timescale ; the variability on hours@xmath0days timescales contrasts with the variability on weeks@xmath0years timescales .",
    "@xcite found that @xmath030% of point sources brighter than 1.5 mjy at 5 ghz were variable , with majority of the sources varying on timescales @xmath2010 days .",
    "this variability is primarily small amplitude ( modulation indices of less than 0.2 ) .",
    "the structure function of the variable sources constructed by @xcite shows a sharp rise on timescales of @xmath201 day , a shallow but steady rise between 110 days , and a roughly constant value beyond 10 days .",
    "a large fraction of variables displaying small variability amplitudes on short timescales were also found by the masiv survey @xcite conducted at 5 ghz .",
    "the findings of @xcite and @xcite suggest that the low - amplitude variability on timescales of @xmath2010 days is mostly extrnisic . among the @xcite radio sources , only 0.3% have modulation indices",
    "greater than 0.2 on timescales less than two years .",
    "the variability fraction that we find on week - month timescales in our pilot survey is similar ( @xmath171% ) , and agrees with the variability fraction found in narrow - deep surveys by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , wide - field surveys such as @xcite , and other studies between 15 ghz on week - month - year timescales . on 1.5 year timescale",
    "we find the variability fraction to be less than 4% .",
    "recently , @xcite compared the 1.4 ghz vla - stripe 82 and first surveys , and found @xmath012% ( 6 percent per epoch @xmath15 2 epochs ) of the sources having fractional variablility larger than 0.3 on timescales between 7 years and 22 years , the majority of which were agn . while it is possible that , on these longer timescales , the fraction of variable sources in the radio sky is large , some of the @xcite variables could be artificial and solely due to angular resolution differences between the vla - stripe 82 and first surveys .",
    "indeed , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite find that the fraction of variables on similar timescales is a few percent or less .",
    "radio variability ( especially extrinsic ) is expected to have a frequency dependence , but this aspect of variability has not been extensively studied .",
    "we can only use the results of past blind surveys to conclude that the fraction of strong variables is less than a few percent between frequencies of 1 ghz and 5 ghz , between flux densities of @xmath00.3 mjy and @xmath0100 mjy , and over a wide gamut of timescales ( between one day and several years ) .    in our pilot survey , we found a single agn , vtc233002 - 002736 , with flux density @xmath43 mjy at 1.4 ghz , that appears to have increased in flux density by more than a factor of ten over the past 15 years .",
    "similar objects may have been found earlier , by @xcite , in the sumss survey ( e.g. j201524 - 395949 or j060938 - 333508 ) .",
    "it is likely that such phenomena are a result of episodes of enhanced accretion leading to increased jet activity ( see * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for discussions of possibly related phenomena ) .",
    "assuming a timescale of @xmath020 years for an enhanced accretion episode , and given that fact that 50 deg@xmath1 of the sky has @xmath02000 agn with flux density @xmath43 mjy @xcite , we can estimate the period of occurrence of such episodes over the lifetime of an agn : @xmath040,000 years .",
    "this is remarkably consistent with previous studies @xcite suggesting some young radio - loud agn to have short - lived jets operating on time scales of 10@xmath16910@xmath170 years .",
    "we searched our four - epoch dataset for transients and found only a single source in the psc ( vtc223612 + 001006 ; rscvn ) that was present in one epoch and absent in the rest .",
    "our transient search was carried out over a single - epoch area of @xmath052 deg@xmath1 , but the sensitivity is not uniform across this area .",
    "for the first three epochs , our transient search was conducted on single - pointing images out to a radius ( @xmath171 ) of @xmath08  from the pointing center .",
    "although the fourth epoch has fairly uniform rms noise , the comparison with the first three epochs for transient search diminishes the significance of the added sensitivity for this epoch .",
    "we can approximate the transient rate larger than a threshold flux density , @xmath172 , using the formulation from appendix c of @xcite .",
    "we use a gaussian primary beam response with half - width at half - maximum ( @xmath173 ) of 7.5 .",
    "the 2@xmath58 upper and lower limits for the number of transient events , n@xmath175 , in 50 deg@xmath1 given that we found one event are 5.683 and 2.3@xmath1510@xmath6 @xcite . since the mean rms noise ( flat sky ) for the first three epochs of our survey is 70  @xmath2jy , we use a 7@xmath58 detection threshold of 0.5 mjy . for rs cvn variables ( active binaries )",
    "we calculate a rate of @xmath176(@xmath40.5 mjy)@xmath1640.0081@xmath177 events deg@xmath6 . for all other types of transients",

    "the top panel shows the upper limits to the transient rates derived from previous radio surveys ( colored wedges ) , the rates derived from radio transient detections ( filled circles with errorbars ) , and the theoretically - expected / empirically - estimated transient rates ( dashed gray lines ; see table  [ tab : transients_summary ] for more details ) .",
    "it should be noted that the expected transient rates are not sharp lines but are probability surfaces in the logn - logs diagram with the `` most - probable '' rates reported as dashed lines .",

    "hence the transient rate is @xmath178 events deg@xmath6 .",
    "@xcite report 57 transients , but some of these are galactic and others have indefinite classifications .",
    "hence , we adopt a 95% confidence level upper limit of 71 transients .",

    "it is evident from these logn - logs diagrams that our pilot survey is not sensitive and wide enough to discover extragalactic explosive transients , but it is already in the regime where stellar flares are expected .",
    "our contemporaneous optical survey with ptf allows us to make a direct comparison between the transient optical and radio skies . within the limiting sensitivities of our experiment",
    ", the transient skies at these two frequencies appear to be quite distinct . in the three months of high - cadence ptf search ,",
    "eight spectroscopically - confirmed supernovae were discovered , none of which were recovered in our radio survey .",
    "conversely , three stellar flares were detected in the radio , but their optical counterparts are saturated in ptf . we thus conclude that future joint radio and optical searches , such as meerkat and meerlicht , may only be beneficial if shallow optical surveys are combined with deep radio surveys or vice versa , or if both surveys are deep ( @xmath2jy - level sensitivity ) .",
    "we find that deep multi - wavelength photometric data and spectroscopy are very important for host and progenitor classification of extragalactic radio transients , and this should inform future slow transient searches .",
    "given the expensive radio observing time , we have attempted to distinguish between agn and other transients based on optical light curves from ptf and sdss .",
    "although in the present study we have optical light curves only for a small fraction of our radio sources ( due to the completeness of optical counterparts ) , we expect to have 100% completeness in the lsst era , when radio transient classification based on optical light curves may be a feasible approach .",
    "the radio sky at frequencies of a few ghz appears to be quiet , with less than a percent of the persistent sources being strong variables . from table",
    "[ tab : transients_summary ] and figure  [ fig : lognlogs ] we find that the rates for a majority of classes of slow radio transients is less than one transient per 10,000 persistent sources .",
    "we also find that the fraction of strong variables and explosive transients among persistent sources in the optical sky is similar to the radio .",
    "however , the large number of persistent optical sources per square degree of the sky ( down to the limiting sensitivity of ptf , @xmath179 mag . , for example ; see figure  [ fig : venn ] ) implies that the number of varying optical sources is much larger than the number of varying radio sources ( down to the limiting sensitivity of our jansky vla survey , @xmath00.5 mjy ) .",
    "accordingly , we conclude that the false positive foreground for future em - gw searches is lower in the radio than in the optical mag . corresponds to 12@xmath2jy . ] .",
    "the rates for extragalactic transients , like core - collapse supernovae and binary neutron star mergers , are significantly low ( table  [ tab : transients_summary ] ) , and it is not surprising that we found none of these transients in our pilot radio survey . surveys over large areas of the sky are thus motivated by the search for such exotica .",
    "therefore , we recommend wide - field surveys like that of the entire @xmath0270 deg@xmath1 of stripe 82 with the jansky vla ( the cnss survey , which is currently underway ) , all - sky surveys like the vla sky survey ( vlass ; the all - sky tier has been recently approved ) , or similar surveys with askap , meerkat , and wsrt / apertif . also , shallow radio surveys are preferred to deep surveys due to the added advantage of restricting the transient population to a low redshift space , thus making optical counterpart search feasible .",

    "<S> we have commenced a multi - year program , the caltech - nrao stripe 82 survey ( cnss ) , to search for radio transients with the jansky vla in the sloan digital sky survey stripe 82 region . </S>",
    "<S> the cnss will deliver five epochs over the entire @xmath0270 deg@xmath1 of stripe 82 , an eventual deep combined map with a rms noise of @xmath040 @xmath2jy and catalogs at a frequency of 3 ghz , and having a spatial resolution of 3 . </S>",
    "<S> this first paper presents the results from an initial pilot survey of a 50 deg@xmath1 region of stripe 82 , involving four epochs spanning logarithmic timescales between one week and 1.5 years , with the combined map having a median rms noise of 35@xmath2jy . </S>",
    "<S> this pilot survey enabled the development of the hardware and software for rapid data processing , as well as transient detection and follow - up , necessary for the full 270 deg@xmath1 survey . </S>",
    "<S> data editing , calibration , imaging , source extraction , cataloging and transient identification were completed in a semi - automated fashion within six hours of completion of each epoch of observations , using dedicated computational hardware at the nrao in socorro , and custom - developed data reduction and transient detection pipelines . </S>",
    "<S> classification of variable and transient sources relied heavily on the wealth of multi - wavelength legacy survey data in the stripe 82 region , supplemented by repeated mapping of the region by the palomar transient factory ( ptf ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3% of the few thousand detected point sources were found to vary by greater than 30% , consistent with similar studies at 1.4 ghz and 5 ghz . </S>",
    "<S> multi - wavelength photometric data and light curves suggest that the variability is mostly due to shock - induced flaring in the jets of agn . </S>",
    "<S> although this was only a pilot survey , we detected two bona fide transients , associated with an rs cvn binary and a dke star . </S>",
    "<S> comparison with existing legacy survey data ( first , vla - stripe 82 ) revealed additional highly variable and transient sources on timescales between 520 years , largely associated with renewed agn activity . </S>",
    "<S> the rates of such agn possibly imply episodes of enhanced accretion and jet activity occurring once every @xmath040,000 years in these galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we compile the revised radio transient rates and make recommendations for future transient surveys and joint radio - optical experiments . </S>"
