    "namely , based on the idea of improving the fulfilment of the divergence constraint by means of grad - div stabilisation @xcite , we equip standard symmetric interior penalty dg - fem @xcite with an additional grad - div term which can be implemented easily in any existing incompressible cfd code . especially the natural treatment of convection - dominated problems ,",
    "the inherent local mass conservation properties due to discontinuous pressures and the computational efficiency make dg - fem appealing for the simulation of incompressible flows . in this context",

    "is introduced in section [ sec : numerics ] . applying this class of dg - fem , in section [ sec : dhc ] , we consider the differentially heated square cavity and the melting of pure gallium is considered in section [ sec : gallium ] .",
    "finally , we summarise the results and conclude this work in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "it turns out that the oberbeck ",
    "boussinesq model can be seen as a one - phase variant of the two - phase enthalpy - porosity model , applicable for fluid flows with solid / liquid phase transition phenomena @xcite .",
    "the development of numerical methods for such melting and solidification problems is numerically demanding due to the presence of a moving solid / liquid phase interface which embodies a sharp interior layer within the considered domain .",
    "+ from a theoretical point of view , the main advantage of the enthalpy - porosity method is that the position of the moving solid / liquid interface is computed implicitly , solely depending on the local temperature , thereby ensuring that conservation of mass , momentum and energy across the interface is satisfied automatically . from a computational point of view",
    "the fixed - grid enthalpy - porosity method circumvents the need of developing more complicated numerical schemes which , for example , capture the phase boundary explicitly by means of adaptive mesh refinement .",
    "comprehensive reviews also of different approaches for modelling solid / liquid phase change problems can be found , for example , in @xcite . in particular , we refer the reader to @xcite for the use of adaptive meshes , to @xcite for the employment of moving grids and to @xcite for an extended finite element method in the context of the numerical solution of melting and solidification problems . for the treatment of the general case of free - surface and free - boundary flows",

    "+ typical for the enthalpy - porosity method is the introduction of a smooth phase change variable @xmath1}$ ] , which depends on the local temperature and indicates solid and liquid phase : @xmath2 this phase change variable corresponds to the fractional volume of a control volume occupied by the liquid phase .",
    "supposing that we can distinguish sharply between both phases , @xmath3 is discontinuous at the temperature of fusion which corresponds to a so - called isothermal phase change and physically means that during the melting process , the enthalpy increases by the latent heat without causing an increase in temperature .",
    "typically , an isothermal phase change takes place for the melting and solidification of pure substances which have a precisely accurate and sharp melting temperature . for any other substances though",
    ", we instead have a certain non - zero temperature bandwidth , the so - called mushy region , over which phase change occursthese are so - called non - isothermal phase change processes . +",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , with regard to the validity of the enthalpy - porosity model we want to emphasise that it is particularly powerful and straight - forward if we are dealing with non - isothermal phase change processes .",
    "however , when there is need to obtain a phase change interface with zero thickness , the enthalpy - porosity method reaches its limit , mainly because it is usually employed with a non - adapted mesh which always has the limitation of a predefined resolution in interfacial regions . to illustrate this problem figure [ fig:1 ] shows the moving phase boundary , represented by certain contours of the phase change indicator @xmath3 which typically intersect the mesh elements of a non - adapted mesh in an arbitrarily complex fashion .",

    "we did not consider such a problem in this work , but the implementation of this modification can be easily done for the numerical schemes explained in section [ sec : numerics ] .",

    ". +    figure [ fig:2 ] shows the streamlines of the velocity field obtained by the grad - div and pressure stabilised taylor  hood type @xmath176 dg - fem on @xmath177 meshes for different values of @xmath178 .",
    "first of all , we note that although we use a coarser mesh , the results are in excellent agreement with the above mentioned literature for the whole range of @xmath178 numbers considered . analysing the flow",
    ", one can see that at the hot wall the fluid is rising whilst at the cold wall the fluid is dropping down where converging streamlines indicate higher velocities .",
    "the behaviour of the flow in the middle of the cavity is strongly dependent on the particular rayleigh number .",
    "for @xmath179 the flow field shows a central vortex with a slight tendency of becoming elliptic . as @xmath178 increases to @xmath180 the vortex disassembles into two vortices which move to the vertical walls , thereby making room for a third small vortex in the centre .",
    "for @xmath181 the central vortex vanishes again and the two vortices move to the upper left and lower right corner , respectively . apart from the vertical walls a stratified flow field is forming .",
    "moreover , we note that the minimum end of time @xmath182 for the simulation which yields a stable stationary solution increases with @xmath178 . + in figure [ fig:3 ] the temperature fields and isotherms obtained by the same dg - fem for different rayleigh numbers are shown . again , excellent agreement of our simulations with the reference solutions can be observed .",
    "as @xmath178 increases the dominant mode for the heat transfer process changes from heat diffusion to heat convection .",
    "for @xmath179 the isotherms are more vertical than horizontal especially near the vertical walls . for @xmath181 , however , the isotherms form a strong thermal boundary layer at the vertical walls whilst being nearly horizontal in the rest of the domain . during the transition from diffusion - dominated to convection - dominated heat transfer , the isotherms for @xmath180 exhibit features of both modes .",
    "it is again important to note that although we used a coarse fixed - mesh without refinement , the sharp thermal and velocity boundary layers at the left and right walls are properly resolved by the proposed method .",
    "+      in addition to verifying qualitatively that our numerical solution is in agreement with previous research we also want to regard the nusselt number , representing heat flux across the cavity , as a quantity measuring the quality of the approximate temperature .",
    "it is important for the reliable application of numerical methods to consider such benchmark values and we note that in the context of conforming fem @xcite the advantage of heavy grad - div stabilisation has only been demonstrated qualitatively without any quantitative analyses .",
    "+ therefore , consider the following nusselt numbers , both averaged over specific vertical lines and averaged over the whole domain , which all coincide for the true solution of the dhc problem @xcite : @xmath183}{\\hspace{-0.1ex}\\left(x_1,x_2\\right)}\\,{{\\mathrm{d}}}x_2 \\\\ { { \\overline{\\mathrm{nu}}}}&= \\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\int_\\omega { \\left[u_{1h}t_h-\\alpha \\frac{\\partial t_h}{\\partial x_1}\\right]}\\,{{\\mathrm{d}}}{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that , for the sake of notation , we agree to consider the nusselt numbers only for the time - independent solution and thereby omit an explicit dependence on the time @xmath184 .",
    "moreover , in order to obtain a measure for the quality of the approximation of the velocity field , we also compute the stream function @xmath185 from @xcite    [ eq : poisson ]    alignat=2 -&=(- ) & &  , + & = 0 & &  ,    where the occurring velocities are again considered to be the stationary solutions of the dhc computations .",
    "problem is always solved by a standard conforming , fifth - order fem on the same mesh as the corresponding dhc simulation . in particular , we analyse the maximum absolute value over the whole cavity of the stream function and the absolute value measured exactly in the middle , i.e. @xmath186 we remark that , on the discrete level , @xmath187 does not necessarily have to coincide with the maximum value of the stream function @xmath188 .",
    "lastly , we want to measure how good and in which sense the discrete velocity @xmath91 satisfies the divergence constraint and thus assess the mass conservation properties of the particular method .",
    "first of all , we note that due to the only approximate continuity across inter - element boundaries in the discrete velocity space @xmath84 , the considered dg - fem methods are non - conforming in the space @xmath189}^2\\colon\\nabla\\cdot{{\\boldsymbol{v}}}\\in{{\\mathscr{l}}}^2{\\hspace{-0.1ex}\\left(\\omega\\right)}\\right\\}\\ ] ] since especially the jump of the normal component across interfaces of the discrete velocity generally does not vanish @xcite .",
    "therefore , the resulting discrete velocity from a classical dg - fem does not have a well - defined divergence in the whole space @xmath190 but only locally on each @xmath56 and we can only consider the broken @xmath90-norm @xmath191 this quantity will be used as a measure for the conservation of mass for all methods which are only approximately @xmath0-conforming .",
    "+ in order to put the results from our proposed stabilised dg - fem into perspective , we want to compare them with solutions obtained by different finite element schemes .",
    "the easiest comparison is to compute an approximate solution with a standard @xmath192-conforming fem .",
    "to this end we use a classical taylor  hood method with globally continuous @xmath193 elements with strongly imposed boundary conditions .",
    "note that such a method naturally is also @xmath0-conforming and thus the divergence of the resulting discrete velocity field belongs to @xmath190 globally .",
    "a well - known major drawback is that this method suffers from poor mass conservation since the divergence constraint is fulfilled only in a weak sense @xcite .",
    "+ furthermore , we want to consider a method which , from the discrete function spaces used , can be described as being located between a conforming fem and the proposed fully non - conforming dg - fem of section [ sec : numerics ] . originating in the work about ldg methods in @xcite we consider the possibility of constructing an exactly divergence - free , inf - sup stable and @xmath0-conforming dg - fem as described in @xcite",
    ". a simple way to achieve this within our previously defined framework is to consider the semi - discrete variational formulation with @xmath82 and without grad - div and pressure stabilisation ( @xmath194 ) and to adapt the corresponding approximation space for the velocity .",

    "note that the strong incorporation of the no - penetration boundary condition @xmath198 in the velocity space @xmath199 is necessary for obtaining an exactly divergence - free solution @xcite .",
    "however , the tangential component of the velocity on the boundary is still only imposed in the weak sense as described in section [ sec : numerics ] .",
    "we refer to this method as @xmath200 } }      } } \\slash { {                                                     \\mathcal{q}_{-k }      } } \\right)}\\wedge { {                                                     \\mathcal{q}_{-k }      } } $ ] .",
    "lastly , we want to emphasise that due to the exact fulfilment of the divergence constraint the velocity error for this method does not depend on the pressure error and thereby yields a pressure - robust method in the sense of @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , a typical situation encountered in applications is that the underlying computational mesh is not sufficiently resolved in critical flow areas .",
    "our aim is to present results for such sub - optimal cases .",
    "therefore , three different equidistant meshes with @xmath201 , @xmath202 and @xmath177 elements will be used for the dg - fem simulations of the dhc problem . in regard to the solutions in figures [ fig:2 ] and [ fig:3 ] for higher rayleigh numbers we clearly observe and fully intend that the occurring velocity and thermal boundary layers are locally under - resolved .",
    "we believe that in such a situation the advantages of the proposed stabilised dg - fem are surfacing more clearly .",
    "+ regarding table [ tab:1 ] we see all the above introduced benchmark quantities for the dhc problem with @xmath181 computed for different numerical schemes .",
    "the reason for beginning with the highest rayleigh number is motivated by this being the computationally most demanding situation .",
    "considering the first block in table [ tab:1 ] , taylor  hood ( th ) and equal - order ( eo ) type dg - fem with and without pressure jump and grad - div stabilisation are compared on a @xmath202 mesh .",
    "the reference values given in @xcite are shown in the last block .",
    "first of all , we observe that even on such a coarse mesh all solutions are quite acceptable for all considered dg - fem .",
    "furthermore , we see that , in terms of mass conservation , the same comparatively high amount of grad - div stabilisation ( @xmath203 ) improves the th type methods more efficiently than the eo type method as the @xmath90-norm of the broken divergence of the former is reduced about one order of magnitude more , even though without grad - div stabilisation they are on a comparable level . note that for the heavily pressure stabilised ( @xmath204 ) th type dg - fem , computations with @xmath205 did not converge at all an observation for which we do not have an explanation .",
    "+ now , we regard the second block of table [ tab:1 ] where different dg - fem are compared on a finer @xmath177 mesh . again , all methods perform well for the considered problem and the benchmark quantities are quite close to the reference values .",
    "moreover , it can be observed that the eo order methods generally seem to yield better results for the temperature but worse for the velocity discretisation . in view of the nusselt numbers it is remarkable that heavy grad - div stabilisation improves the accuracy for the temperature approximation for all considered methods . for the velocity approximation",
    ", however , we see that for the th method without pressure stabilisation and the eo method , a high @xmath131 seems to introduce too much dissipation , thereby decreasing the accuracy of the stream function values .",
    "by contrast , the pressure stabilised th dg - fem has the very nice behaviour that a high grad - div stabilisation simultaneously improves the mass conservation properties of the method and the overall accuracy in terms of the benchmark quantities . for all methods results for a different maximum amount of grad - div stabilisation",
    "are shown corresponding to the experimentally obtained maximum value for which simulations converged .",
    "thus , the pressure stabilised th type dg - fem turns out to be the most robust method with respect to heavy grad - div stabilisation .",
    "however , we note that beyond a certain value , increasing the grad - div parameter only yields a smaller broken divergence but the other benchmark quantities basically remain the same .",
    "for example , this value is @xmath206 for the eo type dg - fem .",
    "+    .benchmark quantities for the dhc problem with @xmath181 .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      it is important to note that the melting range @xmath18 is a non - physical quantity in the sense that gallium , being a pure material with a sharp temperature of fusion , does not posses a mushy region in reality .",
    "therefore , @xmath18 is a purely numerical value and thus can not be taken from existing material databases but different numerical studies are required to deduce an appropriate value of this parameter . in the literature there is no consensus on this choice and we believe that the reason for this is that different numerical schemes require a different @xmath18 . however , in the previous subsection it is shown that for the proposed stabilised dg - fem @xmath212 yields results in excellent agreement with other research .",
    "based on this situation a parametric study is conducted with the objective of demonstrating the behaviour of the solution when we deviate from this case . actually , to the author s knowledge this study is the first attempt to analyse the impact of the melting range @xmath18 on the flow structure for the problem of gallium melting .",
    "+ in figure [ fig:7 ] the velocity field and the phase boundary , represented by the @xmath4-contour of @xmath3 , at @xmath213 computed by the th type dg - fem with @xmath203 and @xmath204 on a @xmath214 mesh can be seen for different melting ranges @xmath18 .",
    "obviously , the particular choice of the melting range has a significant impact on the resulting flow structure as both the number and the position of the resulting vortices is affected .",
    "we observe that any other choice than @xmath212 yields solutions which do not possess four separated vortices of approximately equal size , which is understood to be the numerically correct solution . whilst the upper two vortices are about to merge for @xmath215 ,",
    "the topmost vortex is smaller than the remaining ones and at the bottom of the enclosure , a fifth vortex weakly appears for @xmath216 . for @xmath217",
    "the upper two vortices merge to one , for @xmath218 the position of the vortices is wrong and @xmath219 only yields three vortices .",
    "the main reason for the different position and number of vortices is related to the attenuation @xmath220 which acts whenever @xmath221 . due to the varying width of the mushy region",
    "this attenuation applies differently in each case and yields the apparently different flow structures in the liquid gallium .",
    "+      +    lastly , we want to consider the mushy region , being located between the @xmath222- and @xmath5-contour of @xmath3 , more closely .",
    "therefore , in figure [ fig:8 ] a cutout from the bottom of the enclosure together with the underlying @xmath214 mesh and the phase indicator function @xmath3 is shown .",
    "the light grey represents the liquid phase while the dark grey indicates the solid phase and the transition between the red lines corresponds to the mushy region . by construction ,",
    "the width of the mushy region decreases as the melting range @xmath18 decreases .",
    "note that we decided to present this study only for one fixed mesh size and for this mesh and the th dg - fem with @xmath203 and @xmath204 the smallest value yielding convergent simulations is @xmath219 . naturally , on finer meshes it is of course possible to simulate the problem for even smaller melting ranges .",
    "however , regarding the mushy region for @xmath219 we observe that the phase transition is already restricted locally to a maximum of two neighbouring elements and is thus located sharply .",
    "it is remarkable that the proposed numerical method can deal with the occurring moving interior layers effortlessly even though the mesh is neither adapted to the explicit location of the phase transition , as for example in @xcite , nor globally refined as for example in @xcite .",
    "summarising , this section shows that stabilised dg - fem are very well - suited and efficient for solving thermo - fluid problems involving moving interior layers .",
    "in this work we proposed and analysed the performance of a particular class of stabilised dg - fem for solving thermally - coupled incompressible flow problems with natural convection phenomena based on the oberbeck ",
    "boussinesq approximation .",
    "this class consists of both the mixed - order @xmath176 and the equal - order @xmath223 symmetric interior penalty dg - fem on quadrilateral meshes with the following two additional stabilisation mechanisms . in order to ensure stability of the equal - order method , pressure jump stabilisation necessarily had to be included whereas the mixed - order method can optionally be equipped with such a term .",
    "most importantly and originally , a classical grad - div stabilisation term has been introduced in combination with all dg - fem to improve the mass conservation properties of the schemes .",
    "the significance of local mass conservation should not be underestimated and is important , for example , in the context of energy balances for indoor airflow simulations .",
    "even though , due to the global full discontinuity of the resulting velocity fields , the proposed class of methods is only approximately @xmath0-conforming it has been shown that heavy grad - div stabilisation can be used successfully to improve the overall accuracy of the approximate solution in the context of dg - fem for incompressible natural convection flows . furthermore , as an additional difficulty we decided to exclusively use non - adapted , uniform meshes to illustrate that the proposed methods are very robust and accurate also for this sub - optimal but nonetheless very application - relevant situation of having to use under - refined meshes .",
    "+ therefore , at first the stabilised dg - fem have been applied to the simulation of the classical differentially heated square cavity for moderate to high rayleigh numbers as a representative for problems involving both velocity and thermal boundary layers .",
    "a detailed qualitative and quantitative analysis by means of comparing nusselt numbers , stream function values and the fulfilment of the divergence constraint with high - accuracy reference data from the literature has been provided which shows excellent agreement for all considered stabilised dg - fem . by comparison with a standard conforming fem and an exactly divergence - free @xmath0-conforming method it turned out that our class of dg - fem is the superior choice both in terms of accuracy and efficiency .",
    "furthermore , we showed in detail that whilst heavy grad - div stabilisation always improves the mass conservation properties of any finite element type method which is not already exactly divergence - free , for standard conforming fem the solution deteriorates substantially with an increasing grad - div parameter .",
    "the proposed dg - fem , however , have been shown to not suffer from such a counter - intuitive behaviour .",
    "especially the mixed - order dg - fem with heavy grad - div and additional pressure jump stabilisation showed the most compelling performance .",
    "+ in the last section we dealt with multiphase flow which classically occurs during melting and solidification processes and involves rather complex moving interior layers . in order to account for such non - isothermal solid / liquid phase transitions",
    "the enthalpy - porosity method has been employed .",
    "based on performing best for the heated cavity , for the numerical solution of the resulting mathematical model the grad - div and pressure jump stabilised mixed - order dg - fem was chosen exemplarily .",
    "the problem of melting of pure gallium in a rectangular enclosure has been considered as a benchmark problem for solid / liquid phase change processes .",
    "excellent agreement with previous research was shown , even though much coarser , non - adapted meshes were used which allow for a more efficient solution of the underlying problem . a mesh sensitivity analysis was provided showing that mesh convergence can be reached relatively fast and that , even on surprisingly coarse meshes , the proposed dg - fem still yields at least meaningful results . additionally , a numerical study showed the resulting flow structure for different widths of the melting range from which we deduced that even for remarkably sharp interior layers , the method still converges and remains applicable .",
    "+ altogether , the proposed class of stabilised dg - fem performed excellently in all considered studies even though the corresponding problems were highly dynamic , computationally demanding and non - adapted meshes were used .",
    "it can thus be inferred that interior penalty dg - fem , especially in combination with grad - div and pressure jump stabilisation , are highly promising , robust and efficient numerical methods to deal with weakly non - isothermal , natural convection - driven thermo - fluid flows .",
