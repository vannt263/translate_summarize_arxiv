    "the capability of effectively retrieving the location and/or geometrical features of unknown scatterers from the knowledge of the scattered wave field ( near - field or far - field data ) is of paramount importance in many practical applications such as underground mine detection , geophysical exploration in oil industry , detection of defects or cracks in nondestructive testing , target detection using radar or sonar systems and ultrasound imaging in biomedical equipments @xcite .",
    "both locations and geometrical shapes of scatterers are often the final target in the applications .",
    "many quantitative methods have been developed for such purposes @xcite .",
    "but there is a crucial step for these imaging processes , to find some reasonable estimated locations and shapes as their initial computational sampling domains , otherwise the imaging processes may not work or work with huge computational efforts .    a promising direct sampling method ( dsm )",
    "was proposed recently in @xcite to recover the inhomogeneous medium scatterers from near - field measurement data for inverse acoustic medium scattering problems .",
    "compared with other sampling - type schemes ( see , e.g. , @xcite for the detailed surveys ) such as multiple signal classification ( music ) @xcite and linear sampling method ( lsm ) @xcite , a distinct feature of the dsm is its capability of depicting the profile of medium scatterers using one or very few incident wave fields , through the computationally very cheap inner products of the measured data and the fundamental solution in the homogeneous background medium .    in this work , we will further explore in this direction by generalizing the dsm from the knowledge of near - field data to far - field data of the scattered waves for inverse medium and obstacle scattering problems .",
    "extensive numerical experiments are done to investigate systematically the behavior of the dsm .",
    "an important new observation is that the dsm is able to recover not only medium scatterers , but also obstacles , and even cracks using one or two incident waves .",
    "the full inverse scattering problem ( isp ) is to determine both the shapes and the physical profiles of the scatterers , hence may require the measured data at many frequencies , not the one from a single frequency as considered in this work .",
    "it is well known that the isp is highly nonlinear , and the first key step for the numerical treatment of a nonlinear problem is to work out a good initial guess for its approximate solution . as dsm is computationally very cheap and works with the data from only one or few incident fields , it can naturally serve as a fast , simple and effective alternative to existing numerical tools for locating a reliable approximate position of the unknown scatterers , which can then serve as a good initial guess in any existing method ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) for achieving a more accurate estimate of the scatterer support and the inhomogeneity distribution . as we shall see numerically",
    ", the dsm can provide a very reliable location of each individual scatterer component so that one may start with a much smaller sampling region in a more accurate but computationally more demanding method .",
    "the reduction of the sizes of the initial sampling regions for unknown scatterers may save us an essential fraction of the computational efforts in the entire reconstruction process by most existing methods .",
    "other approaches are available in the literature , which do not require an a priori good initial guess of the scatterers , e.g. , the globally convergent numerical method .",
    "we refer to the monograph @xcite and many references therein for the detailed description of the method and its theory for isps corresponding to some hyperbolic equations .",
    "because of the time dependence , the isps of @xcite can be considered as the ones with the data given at many frequencies .",
    "inverse scattering reconstruction methods using one single incident wave , or simply _ one - shot _ methods , date back to a long - standing open problem in the inverse scattering community , namely whether one can determine the unknown scatterer by using the near - field / far - field data from only one or several incident waves . theoretically , the results on unique identifiability have been understood only partially , e.g. , for some special classes of scatterers @xcite , or for the class of polygonal or polyhedral scatterers @xcite .",
    "armed with the aforementioned uniqueness results , one - shot methods have been studied widely in the past few years , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "this work extends the one in @xcite to make a more systematical investigation of such a promising one - shot method applied to inverse scattering problems using near - field or far - field data for many possible cases of scatterers : obstacles , inhomogeneous media and cracks or their combinations .",
    "this study reveals more potentials of the one - shot method and provides some physical hints to answer the pending open problem from the numerical perspective .",
    "we emphasize that the direct sampling method in the current work is based on the same indicator function as that in the orthogonality sampling method developed and studied in @xcite , but we shall present a different approach and motivation to derive this method and justify its effectiveness , in particular removing the `` smallness '' assumption that is crucial to the derivation of the method in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : review : isp ] a brief review of inverse scattering problems is presented , along with some useful notations and identities .",
    "section  [ sec : dsm ] describes the mathematical motivation of the dsm using far - field data and proposes a new indicator function .",
    "section  [ sec : numerics ] provides extensive numerical simulations to evaluate the performance of the dsm using near - field or far - field data from obstacles , media and cracks . in addition",
    ", we shall provide a physical interpretation of the dsm , and compare the major features of the dsms using near - field and far - field data .",
    "some concluding remarks will be given in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in this section we shall briefly describe the time harmonic inverse obstacle and medium scattering problem using near - field or far - field measurements @xcite . consider a homogeneous background space @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) that contains some scatterer components such as obstacles or inhomogeneous media , or both , occupying a bounded domain @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath3 be an incident plane wave , with the incident direction @xmath4 and the wave number @xmath5 , and @xmath6 be the total field formed by the incident and scattered fields .",
    "then the total field @xmath7 induced by the obstacles satisfies the helmholtz equation @xmath8 or induced by the inhomogeneous medium scatterers satisfies @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the refractive index . to account for the absorbing medium ,",
    "the refractive index can be modeled by the complex form @xmath11 the models above describe not only time - harmonic acoustic wave propagation , but also electromagnetic wave propagation in either the transverse magnetic or transverse electric models @xcite .",
    "note that the obstacle scatterer can be viewed as the limiting case of the medium scatterer with vanishing or singular material properties .",
    "for example , an acoustic sound - soft obstacle is a limiting case of as @xmath12 ; see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "( 4.4 ) ) or ( * ? ? ?",
    "4 ) . one may also refer to @xcite for the sound - hard limiting case for general dimensions .",
    "therefore , the indicator functions derived in the sequel are applicable to both inverse obstacle and medium scattering problems , although our derivations are based only on the medium scattering case .",
    "in the rest of this section we introduce some basic notation and fundamental functions that will be needed in the subsequent discussions .",
    "first , we define a coefficient function , @xmath13 , which characterizes the inhomogeneity of the concerned media and is supported in the scatterer @xmath14 .",
    "then we define function @xmath15 , which is called the induced current by the inhomogeneous media .",
    "let @xmath16 be the fundamental solution to the helmholtz equation in the homogeneous background , that can be represented by ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath17 where @xmath18 refers to the hankel function of the first kind and zeroth - order . with the help of the asymptotic properties of the fundamental solution @xmath19 (",
    "( 2.14 ) and ( 3.63 ) ) , we have for @xmath1 that @xmath20 with @xmath21 . the scattered near - field @xmath22 and the far - field @xmath23 in ( [ eq : us : uinf : relation ] )",
    "has the following very convenient representations ( cf .",
    "* eqs.,(8.12 ) and ( 8.27 ) ) ) : @xmath24 where the far - field pattern associated with the fundamental solution @xmath19 is given by @xmath25",
    "in this section we shall derive the dsm using far - field data .",
    "like many other sampling - type methods such as lsm , music and factorization methods @xcite , the essence of the dsm is to construct an indicator function which has significantly different behaviors inside and outside the scatterers , e.g. , the indicator function of the lsm blows up outside the scatterer but remains finite within the scatterer . let @xmath26 be the surface where the near - field data is measured , @xmath27 be a domain contained inside @xmath26 such that the scatterer @xmath2 lies in @xmath27 .",
    "for any sampling point @xmath28 , the indicator function of the dsm using near - field data is given by ( cf.@xcite ) @xmath29 for the motivation and derivations of using near - field data we refer the reader to @xcite .    we are now going to derive an indicator function for the far - field data , a counterpart of for the near - field data .",
    "to do so , we first derive the following key lemma about the @xmath30-correlation measure of the far - field data of two monopoles on the unit sphere .    [",
    "lem : ginf ] for the far - field patterns @xmath31 associated with the fundamental solutions @xmath16 ( see and ) , the following correlation holds for any two points @xmath32 and @xmath33 in the sampling domain @xmath27 : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a constant depending only on the wave number @xmath5 and the dimension @xmath36 .    by the definition of @xmath37 , it is easy to verify that @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a constant depending only on the wave number @xmath5 and the dimension @xmath36 .",
    "we carry out the proof in two steps , one for @xmath40 , and the other for @xmath41 .    *",
    "step 1*. for @xmath40 , is a special case of graf s addition theorem ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq .  ( 9.1.79 ) ) by showing an integral representation of @xmath42 for an integer @xmath43 . to see this , we can write the right - hand side of in polar coordinates @xmath44 it suffices to show that @xmath45 with @xmath46 , and @xmath47",
    "therefore we can arrive at in two dimensions , by setting @xmath48 , replacing @xmath49 by @xmath50 in and using the fact that @xmath51 the formula expresses regular cylindrical wave functions as a superposition of plane waves . to see",
    ", we first recall the jacobi expansion ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq .  ( 22 ) ) @xmath52 by replacing @xmath53 by @xmath54 in , then multiplying it by @xmath55 and integrating over @xmath56 with respect to @xmath57 we obtain @xmath58 where we have employed the simple fact that @xmath59 for @xmath48 and @xmath60 for @xmath61 .",
    "now we can rewrite as @xmath62 which reproduces by a simple rearrangement .    *",
    "step 2*. for @xmath41 , we use the following special variant of the funk - hecke formula ( cf .",
    "2.44 ) and @xcite ) @xmath63 for spherical harmonics @xmath64 of order @xmath43 and spherical bessel functions @xmath65 of order @xmath43 .",
    "now we set @xmath48 and replace @xmath49 by @xmath66 in .",
    "being aware of the lowest order spherical harmonics @xmath67 , which is a constant and thus can be dropped from both sides of the equation . since @xmath68",
    ", we obtain that @xmath69 in three dimensions .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "next , we divide the sampling domain @xmath27 enclosing the scatterer @xmath2 into a set of small elements @xmath70 , i.e. , squares in 2d or cubes in 3d .",
    "then we approximate the integral relation by the rectangular quadrature rule on each element : @xmath71 where the summation is over all elements @xmath72 which intersect the sampling domain @xmath27 , the weight @xmath73 is given by @xmath74 , with @xmath75 being the area / volume of the @xmath76-th element @xmath77 ( @xmath40 , @xmath78 ) and @xmath79 the evaluation of @xmath80 at the center of @xmath77 .    now multiplying by @xmath81 for any sampling point @xmath28 , then integrating over the unit sphere @xmath82 and using ( [ eq : ginf : identity ] ) ,",
    "we obtain @xmath83 as we illustrate later ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : decay ] ) , the right - hand side term @xmath84 above approaches a constant when @xmath33 tends close to some point scatterer @xmath32 and decays quickly as @xmath33 moves away from @xmath32 . this behavior motivates us with the following important indicator function for any sampling point @xmath28 : @xmath85 where the @xmath30-inner product occurring in the numerator is the integral given by the left - hand side of ( [ eq : uinf : reason ] ) . in view of the singular behaviors of the fundamental solution @xmath86 in ( [ eq : uinf : reason ] ) , the indicator @xmath87 approaches the unity when @xmath33 tends close to or lies within the medium scatterer and decays quickly as @xmath33 moves away from the scatterer ; see fig .  [",
    "fig : decay ] .",
    "this indicating behavior will serve as the key ingredient in our new dsm using far - field data .",
    "we emphasize that the indicator function @xmath88 in ( [ eq : indicator : far ] ) was studied earlier in the orthogonality sampling method @xcite , but derived from a different approach and motivation , and under a `` smallness '' assumption .",
    "as it has been seen , our theoretical foundation does not require such _ smallness _ restriction , thus makes it possible to explain partially why the dsm works also well for thin or long scatterers like rings and cracks .",
    "this is confirmed by numerical tests ( see examples 6 and 7 in section  [ sec : numerics ] ) .",
    "finally we make a short remark about computing the indicator function @xmath87 in . clearly the computing is purely explicit and direct , involving only a cheap scalar product and a normalization operation , and it does not involve any matrix inversion and any solution process .",
    "moreover , normalizations are quite cheap too .",
    "in fact we can easily see that the denominator in is actually a constant and does not depend on the sampling point @xmath33 , so it can be computed once for all sampling points .",
    "this is quite different from the indicator function ( [ eq : indicator : near ] ) using near - field data .",
    "therefore , the dsm using far - field data is computationally much cheaper than its counterpart using near - field data .",
    "in this section , we will carry out a systematic evaluation of the performance of the dsm using the far - field data for some inverse scattering benchmark problems , including scatterers of obstacle , medium and crack types . in particular , we shall also present the numerical reconstructions by the dsm using the near - field data for most examples so that we may clearly see the comparisons and distinctions between these two different types of measurement data .",
    "let us first introduce our experiment settings .",
    "we shall present several examples to illustrate the applicability and robustness of the proposed method for determining the scatterers from both exact and noisy data .",
    "we shall take the unitary wavelength @xmath89 , and the wave number @xmath90 .",
    "when it is not mentioned , only one incident direction @xmath91 is employed in the examples ; otherwise two incidents , @xmath92 and @xmath93 , are used and mentioned explicitly . in all the examples ,",
    "the scattered near - field data @xmath22 is measured at 50 points uniformly distributed on a circle of radius @xmath94 centered at the origin , and the far - field pattern @xmath23 is observed from 50 uniform distributed angles on the unit circle @xmath95 .",
    "the noisy data @xmath96 and @xmath97 are generated point - wise by the formulae @xmath98 for both near - field and far - field data respectively , where @xmath99 refers to the relative noise level , and both real and imaginary parts of the noise @xmath100 follow the standard normal distribution .",
    "our near - field data are synthesized using the quadratic finite element discretization in the domain @xmath101 enclosed by a pml layer of width @xmath102 to damp the reflection . local adaptive refinement scheme within the inhomogeneous scatterer",
    "is adopted to enhance the resolution of the scattered wave .",
    "the far - field data are generated approximately by the integral representation ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq .  ( 3.64 ) ) along the circle centered at the origin with radius @xmath103 using the composite simpson s rule : @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the integrand of eq .",

    "the indicator function value is normalized between @xmath60 and @xmath102 , and the sampling domain is fixed to be @xmath111^{2}$ ] , which is divided into small squares of equal width @xmath112 .",
    "the contour plot of the indicator function value will be displayed as an estimate to the profiles of unknown scatterers .",

    "we denote the dsm using near - field and far - field data by dsm(n ) and dsm(f ) , respectively , for sake of comparisons of their performances .",
    "we shall carry out three groups of benchmark problems : medium scatterer , obstacle scatterer , and crack scatterer .",
    "we first test the four examples from @xcite , but using both near - field and far - field data to compare the performances of two different types of data .",
    "* example 1 * ( a singular point medium ) .",
    "the example considers one square scatterer of width @xmath122 located at the origin , with coefficient @xmath123 of the scatterer being @xmath102 .",
