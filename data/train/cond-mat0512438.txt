    "boron nitride nanotubes ( bnnts ) have attracted an enormous amount of attention@xcite as a typical representative of iii - v compound tubes , partially because they have the morphology of honeycomb analogous to carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) .",
    "however , different from cnts , bnnts are semiconducting with an uniform wide energy gap,@xcite and their electronic properties are independent of the tube diameter , chirality and of whether a nanotube is single - walled or multiwalled.@xcite owing to the unique geometrical structure and uniform semiconducting behavior , bnnts are expected to have significant applications in the molecule - based logic gates and high - strength fibers .    on the other hand , for the hollow nanotube with high surface - area - to - volume ratio , the doping is recognized to be a significant and attractive approach@xcite of functionalizing the nanotube because it provides various possibilities for controlling the physical properties . in particular , previous studies showed that the doping of carbon ( c ) atoms into bnnts could visibly decrease the band gap,@xcite and such a gap decrease is sensitively dependent upon the content of c atoms.@xcite subsequently , han _",
    "et al . _ developed a simple chemical route to successfully coat bnnts with a conductive stannic oxide for the sensor application.@xcite recently , tang _",
    "et al . _ found experimentally that the resistance and resistivity of the fluorinated bnnt are about 3 orders of magnitude less than those of the pure bnnt , and suggested that it might be important for applications in the future nanoscale electronic devices with tunable properties.@xcite thus , uniformly doped bnnts obtained through chemical modification could be very effective for tailoring the electronic properties , and the related mechanism and behavior are valuable to be explored in theory .    in this paper",
    ", we demonstrate a feasible way to modify the electronic properties by atomic adsorbing on perfectly fabricated bnnts , which is different from the conventional way by doping foreign species into host systems in the nanotube growth process.@xcite firstly , we study the adsorption of several representative first - row atoms with different electronegativity on single - walled bnnts through first - principles calculations .",
    "and then we analyze the adsorption selectivity of bnnts from the localized characteristics of electronic states near the fermi level and discuss the adsorption behavior of these atoms on bnnts based on the frontier molecular orbital theory .",
    "finally we explore the mechanism of modification of the electronic properties of bnnts by adsorption .",
    "since many experiments have shown that bnnts prefer a nonhelical or zigzag orientation during the growth,@xcite we emphatically address the adsorption of zigzag bnnts . a finite - length cylindrical bn cage , consisting of 48 b and 48 n atoms , is chosen to represent the stem of a zigzag single - walled ( 8,0 ) bnnt .",
    "two mouths of the tube are terminated by the hydrogen atoms to avoid the boundary effect . in general",
    ", the interaction between two different atoms or elements could be simply evaluated in term of the pauli electronegativity ( pe ) and first ionization potential ( fip ) . with respect to pes and fips of b and n atoms ,",
    "we choose three types of first - row atoms , lithium ( li ) , c and fluorine ( f ) , with different pe and fip as the representatives of adsorbate to study the adsorption properties of bnnts .",

    "the single - particle wave functions in the kohn - sham equations are expanded by the double - numerical basis .",
    "structural optimizations are deemed sufficiently converged when the forces on all ions are less than 10@xmath5 a.u ..",
    "an important and primary feature of compound tubes is that the distributions of positive and negative charges along the tube stem are much more nonuniform than those of elementary tubes ( e.g. , cnts ) because of the unambiguous charge transfer from one component with low electronegativity to another with high electronegativity in tubes .",
    "typically , the calculated charge transfer from the b to n atom is 0.111 e per b - n pair in the ( 8,0 ) bnnt .",
    "so in general the isolated bnnt could be regarded as an unique tube that consists of the equal number of `` n cations '' and `` b anions '' , and possesses the large `` ionicity '' . in principle , the resulting influences on the structures and properties of bnnts could be understood in virtue of the local density of states ( ldos ) .",
    "[ fig : fig1](a ) shows the calculated ldos of b and n atoms of the ( 8,0 ) bnnt .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath0 and @xmath1 states from the b and n atoms strongly mix together in the lower or higher energy region far from the fermi level . while the occupied and unoccupied states near the fermi level are mainly contributed by @xmath1 states , rather than @xmath0 states , of n and b atoms , respectively .",
    "the former ( the occupied states ) corresponds to the @xmath6 bonds between the constitute atoms in virtue of the @xmath7 hybridization , which guarantees the basic honeycomb framework , high young s modulus and tensile strength.@xcite in contrast , the latter ( the unoccupied states ) mainly determines some physical and chemical properties of bnnts ( such as conductivity and chemical activity ) .",
    "the further composition analysis on the corresponding frontier molecular orbitals ( fmos ) demonstrates that these occupied and unoccupied states near the fermi level exhibit quite different localized characteristics .",
    "for instance , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](b ) , the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) corresponds to isolated electron pairs localized at the n atoms and has the spindle - shape scheme like as @xmath8 orbitals , whereas the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) is present as @xmath9 states localized at the b - n pair along the tube - axis and is contributed by the b-@xmath1 ( major ) and n-@xmath1 ( minor ) states .",
    "the corresponding spatial orientations are well perpendicular to the cylindrical surface . in principle , the nature of localized states near the fermi level is crucial for understanding the structures and properties of doped bnnts . in the following text , we systematically study the adsorption behavior of single first - row atoms on bnnts and thoroughly probe the related adsorption mechanism .    in the doping procedure , the interactions between host bnnts and foreign species can be usually classified into the physical and chemical interactions .",
    "indeed the chemical interaction might play more significant role than the physical interaction in practical applications of bnnts , such as hydrogen storage@xcite and modification of the electronic property.@xcite since the occupied and unoccupied states near the fermi level in bnnts have the distinctly different localized characteristics , we could deduce that the chemical interaction between bnnts and dopants certainly will be characterized as highly selective , and the resulting adsorption behavior and effect ought to be more complicated and interesting than those in cnts in the same doping procedure .",
    "in general , the chemical activity of single atom could be evaluated by the pe or fip.@xcite to more comprehensively and systematically probe the mechanism of selective adsorption of bnnts , we choose three types of first - row atoms , li , c and f as the representatives .",
    "the order of pe is : li(0.98)@xmath10b(2.04)@xmath10c(2.55)@xmath10n(3.04)@xmath10f(3.98 ) , and that of fip is : li(5.392)@xmath10b(8.298)@xmath10c(11.260)@xmath10n(14.534)@xmath10f ( 17.422 ) , respectively . from the spatial orientations and distributions of fmos in bnnts",
    ", we choose the top sites of b and n atoms , the bridge sites between b and n atoms and the center site above the hexagon as the initial adsorption sites .",
    "after full relaxations , we obtain the optimized adsorption site , adsorption energy@xcite and adsorption height as summarized in table  [ tab : table1 ] .    cccc atom & adsorption site & @xmath11 ( ev ) & @xmath12 (  ) +   + & b&@xmath13&3.02 + li&n&@xmath14&2.28 + & center&@xmath15&1.80 + c&bridge&@xmath16&1.26 + f&b&@xmath17&1.84 +    it is found that the f atom prefers to stay at the top site of the b atom ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ) , and it is energetically favorable for the c atom to stay at the b - n bridge site which is perpendicular to the tube - axis ( see fig .  [ fig : fig2 ] ) .",
    "whereas the li atom can hardly be adsorbed on the bnnt since its adsorption energy is positive .",
    "the positive adsorption energy indicates an endothermal reaction , which is in accordance with the previous theoretical study.@xcite the reason is that the bnnt with partial ionic bonding is an electron - sufficient system , and hardly accepts the excessive electrons from the environment .",
    "furthermore , the adsorption energy of the f atom on bnnt ( f / bnnt ) is larger than that of the c atom on bnnt ( c / bnnt ) because the electronegativity of the f atom is larger than that of the c atom .",
    "the adsorption of the f and c atoms corresponds to a classical chemical adsorption ( or interaction ) .",
    "the formation of new chemical bonds definitely changes the original electronic states , and then influences the electronic properties of bnnts .",

    ", the n - b - n angles decrease to 110.8@xmath18 , 110.8@xmath18 and 105.1@xmath18 , respectively . and",
    "the b - n - b angles are changed to 121.8@xmath18 , 121.8@xmath18 and 113.3@xmath18 , respectively .",
    "correspondingly , the first neighbor b - n bond lengths are changed from 1.458  and 1.461  to 1.542  and 1.571  , and others are slightly changed with the magnitude of 0.03  .",
    "especially , the b - f bond length is 1.422  , which is somewhat larger than the expected value for the b - f single bond ( 1.37 )@xcite and the bond lengths of boron trifluoride molecule ( 1.31 ).@xcite all f - b - n bond angles are 110.0@xmath18 as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](c ) .",
    "these changes of bond length and bond angle indicate that the electronic states of the b and n atoms adjacent to the adsorbate exhibit the mixed characteristic of the @xmath19 and @xmath20 hybridizations , instead of the @xmath19 hybridization in the pure bnnt , and the @xmath20 component in the adr of the f / bnnt is much more than that of the c / bnnt .",
    "[ tbp ]     the more detailed analysis of the adsorption effect could be obtained from the change of electronic states .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] shows deformation charge densities of the c / bnnt and f / bnnt .",
    "it can be seen that the b - n bond adjacent to the adsorbed c or f atom is evidently weakened with the formation of new chemical bonds between the c ( or f ) and b ( and n ) atoms .",
    "the mulliken population analysis@xcite further verifies that the adsorption not only induces the charge transfer between the b , n and c atoms in the adr , but also leads to the charge re - distribution of two other neighboring b ( or n ) atoms in the c / bnnt .",
    "typically , the c atom accepts the electrons from the nearest neighbor b atom , and simultaneously donates the electrons to the nearest neighbor n atom .",
    "and the net charge transfer between the c atom and bnnt does not exceed 0.040 e. this reveals the c - n and c - b bonds are covalent - like .",

    "one f atom accepts 0.353 e from the b atom , which is three times larger than the charge transfer between the b and n atoms in the pure bnnt , and the b - f bond exhibits ionicity .",

    "the formation of chemical bond are originated from the interaction between the lumo of the f atom and the fmos of about 2.10 ev below the fermi level ( which are partially contributed by b-@xmath1 states as shown in fig .",
