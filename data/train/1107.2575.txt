    "calculus is more then 300 years old topic , which during recent decades became a powerful and widely used tool for better modeling and control of processes in many fields of science and engineering @xcite .",
    "the term  fractional calculus \" has some historical background and is used for denoting the theory of integration and differentiation of arbitrary real ( not necessarily integer ) order .    the standard notation for denoting the left - sided fractional - order differentiation of a function @xmath0 defined in the interval @xmath1 $ ] is @xmath2 , with @xmath3 . sometimes a simplified notation @xmath4 or @xmath5 is used . in some applications also",
    "right - sided fractional derivatives @xmath6 are used , but in the present article we will use only left - sided fractional derivatives . even from the notation one can see that evaluation of the left - sided fractional - order operators require the values of the function @xmath0 in the interval @xmath7 $ ] . when @xmath8 becomes an integer number , this interval shrinks to the vicinity of the point @xmath9 , and",
    "we obtain the classical integer - order derivatives as particular cases .",
    "there are several definitions of the fractional derivatives and integrals , of which we need only the following two .    the caputo definition of fractional differentiation can be written as @xcite : @xmath10 @xmath11 where @xmath12 is euler s gamma function .    above caputo definition",
    "is extremely useful in the time domain studies , because the initial conditions for the fractional - order differential equations with the caputo derivatives can be given in the same form as for the integer - order differential equations .",
    "this is an advantage in applied problems , which require the use of initial conditions containing starting values of the function and its integer - order derivatives @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 ,  , @xmath16 .    the formula for the laplace transform of the caputo fractional derivative ( [ caputo ] ) has the form @xcite : @xmath17 @xmath18    if the process @xmath0 is considered from the state of absolute rest , so @xmath0 and its integer - order derivatives are equal to zero at the starting time @xmath19 , then the laplace transform of the @xmath8-th derivative of @xmath0 is simply @xmath20 .",
    "the second definition , which we need , is the definition of the left - sided caputo - weyl fractional derivative : @xmath21 @xmath11    the fourier transform of @xmath22 is simply @xmath23 .",
    "the caputo - weyl definition must be used in the frequency domain studies of fractional - order systems .",
    "the caputo - weyl derivative can be considered as the caputo derivative with . in other words ,",
    "the caputo definition allows the study of the transient effects in fractional - order systems , which were initially at the state of rest , while the caputo - weyl definition allows the study of frequency responses of such systems .",
    "fractional - order models have been already used for modeling of electrical circuits ( such as domino ladders , tree structures , etc . ) and elements ( coils , memristor , etc . ) .",
    "the review of such models can be found in @xcite .",
    "let us consider , for instance , a capacitor as a basic element of many circuits .",
    "westerlund and ekstam in 1994 proposed a new linear capacitor model @xcite .",
    "it is based on curie s empirical law of 1889 which states that the current through a capacitor is @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath8 are constant , @xmath26 is the _ dc _ voltage applied at @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , @xmath29 .    for a general input voltage @xmath30",
    "the current is @xmath31 where @xmath32 is capacitance of the capacitor .",
    "it is related to the kind of dielectric used in the capacitor .",
    "the order @xmath8 is related to the losses of the capacitor .",
    "westerlund and ekstam provided in their work the table of various capacitor dielectrics with appropriated constants @xmath8 which have been obtained experimentally by measurements .",
    "the relationship between the current and the voltage in a  capacitor is described using fractional - order integration : @xmath33    then the impedance of a fractional capacitor is : @xmath34    ideal bode s characteristics of the transfer function for a  real capacitor ( [ zc ] ) are depicted in fig .",
    "[ bzc ] .",
    "general characteristics of the transfer function of a real capacitor ( [ zc ] ) are @xcite :    * magnitude : constant slope of @xmath35 * crossover frequency : a function of @xmath36 ; * phase : horizontal line of @xmath37    besides this fractional - order capacitor model , we can mention the new fractional - order models of coils @xcite , memristive systems @xcite , ultracapacitors @xcite , and the element called fractor @xcite .",
    "such elements can be combined with classical passive and active elements for creating various types of electrical circuits .    among the aforementioned fractional - order elements ,",
    "the fractor is of special interest , because it is known that the order of fractor slowly changes in time with aging of chemical materials of which it is composed ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table i ) .",
    "in other words , fractor is an example of an element of variable non - integer order .",
    "such variable - order behavior of the fractor was experimentally studied in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that variable - order behavior can be observed in a wide class of ladder - type circuits composed of standard passive elements .",
    "besides simple elements like a capacitor , electrical circuits of more or less complex structure were studied by many authors . the review of most of the previous efforts can be found in @xcite . a circuit that exhibits fractional - order behavior",
    "is called a _ fractance _  @xcite .",
    "the fractance devices have the following characteristics @xcite .",
    "first , the phase angle is constant independent of the frequency within a wide frequency band .",
    "second , it is possible to construct a filter having a moderate characteristics which can not be realized by using the conventional devices .    generally speaking , there are three basic types of fractances .",
    "the most popular is a domino ladder circuit network @xcite .",
    "another type is a tree structure of electrical elements @xcite , and finally , we can find out also some transmission line circuit ( or symmetrical domino ladder @xcite ) .",
    "design of fractances having given order @xmath8 can be done easily using any of the rational approximations or a truncated continued fraction expansion ( cfe ) , which also gives a rational approximation @xcite .",
    "truncated cfe does not require any further transformation ; a rational approximation based on any other methods must be first transformed to the form of a continued fraction ; then the values of the electrical elements , which are necessary for building a fractance , are determined from the obtained finite continued fraction .",
    "if all coefficients of the obtained finite continued fraction are positive , then the fractance can be made of classical passive elements ( resistors and capacitors ) .",
    "if some of the coefficients are negative , then the fractance can be made with the help of negative impedance converters  @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning also the constant phase element ( cpe ) , which exhibits the fractional - order behavior as well .",
    "it is a metal - insulator - solution or metal - insulator - liquid interface used in electrochemistry .",
    "cpe interprets a dipole layer capacitance @xcite .",
    "the impedance of cpe is expressed as @xmath38 and cpe can not be described by a finite number of passive elements with frequency independent values .",
    "several different algorithms for approximation the fractional order integrators are currently available @xcite .",
    "most of them are based on some form of approximation of irrational transfer functions in the complex domain .",
    "the commonly used approaches include the aforementioned cfe method and its modifications , or representation by a quotient of polynomials in @xmath39 in a factorized form .",
    "the main disadvantage of these algorithms is that the values of electrical elements ( like resistors and capacitors ) needed for the approximation are not the standard values of elements produced by manufacturers .",
    "however , it is still possible to obtain highly accurate and practically usable implementations of a fractional - order integrator using only standard elements with the standard values available in the market .",
    "the idea of this practical approach to implementation of fractional - order systems is based on the domino ladder structure .",

    "outside of this frequency range the domino ladder behaves as a variable - order system , where the order depends on the frequency , as one can conclude directly from the bode plots .    at the same time , in the time domain the same domino ladder behaves as an integrator of variable non - integer order , where the order depends on the length of the time interval .",
    "close to the starting time instance @xmath19 , the domino ladder behaves as an integrator of order @xmath111 , and with growing @xmath9 the domino ladder behaves closer and closer to the classical integrator of order @xmath102 .",
    "it should be mentioned that although the domino ladder order , @xmath108 , tends to @xmath102 , the order @xmath102 is never reached . however , in many practical applications it is sufficient to neglect the transient effects for some initial time interval and to assume that @xmath112 for all @xmath9 .",
    "the similar observations hold for the nested ladder circuit , which has been introduced in this paper . in some frequency range",
    "it behaves as an integrator of order 0.25 , and outside of this frequency range it behaves as a variable - order system , where the order depends on the frequency .    in the time domain",
    "the nested ladder circuit behaves like a variable - order integrator , with order @xmath108 starting close to 0.25 , and then increasing towards 1 ; the order @xmath102 is also never reached in the considered time interval .",
    "the frequency range and the time interval , where the order of the nested ladder is close to 0.25 , can be extended by increasing the number of levels of the ladders in the nested structure , and by increasing the numbers of steps in those ladders .",
    "in this paper we have presented the experimental study of the two types of electrical circuits made only of passive elements , which exhibit non - integer order behavior .",
    "one of them is the domino ladder , which already appeared in the works of other authors on the fractional - order systems .",
    "the other one is the circuit that we call the nested ladder and which was introduced in this paper .    for both these types of circuits we demonstrated that they should be considered not just as non - integer order systems , but as variable - order systems , where the order depends either on the frequency ( in the frequency domain ) or on the time variable ( in the time domain ) .",
    "while in the frequency domain the frequency - dependent variable order is obvious directly from the bode plots , providing the evidence of the variable - order behavior of the considered circuits in the time domain required some additional tools .",
    "namely , we suggested a method of data fitting with the help of the mittag - leffler function , explained a link between such fitting and fractional - order differential equations , and provided the matlab routines for such fitting .",
    "the approach to identification of variable - order systems , that we presented in this paper , can be used for creating variable - order models for many other processes .",
