    "the notion of causality is deeply rooted in our understanding of nature .",
    "one can operationally define causality as the possibility of signaling from event a to event b. in ordinary situations with a fixed spacetime background we say that a can cause b if the former belongs to the past light cone of the latter .",
    "equivalently , the effect b belongs to the future light cone of the cause a. typically , the light cones are fixed , so that it is always possible to apply this notion of causality .",
    "nevertheless , in regimes where both general relativity and quantum mechanics are expected to be relevant it has been argued that the idea of causality should be revised @xcite . on the one hand ,",
    "any physical situation described by quantum mechanics can be formulated in terms of a set of probabilities for local outcomes on a global background . on the other hand , in general relativity",
    "the causal structure is dynamical , since it depends on the displacements of masses in the spacetime , and probability plays no fundamental role in the theory .",
    "therefore , it has been argued that a theory unifying general relativity and quantum mechanics should be a probabilistic theory on a dynamical causal structure @xcite .",
    "the process ( @xmath0-matrix ) formalism @xcite is an operational way to approach this problem .",
    "the framework retains the validity of ordinary quantum mechanics at a local level , i.e. in local laboratories where quantum operations are performed , whereas no assumptions are made on the global causal structure outside the laboratories .",
    "interestingly , the processes compatible with the @xmath0-matrix framework are more general than those allowed by the standard quantum formalism . in particular ,",
    "they include situations in which the direction of the signaling , and thus causality in the operational sense , is not fixed .",
    "nonetheless , logical paradoxes , such as signaling to the past , are ruled out by consistency conditions .",
    "we are interested in processes , which we refer to as _ causally nonseparable _ , where it is not possible to decompose the @xmath0-matrix as @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 .",
    "if equation holds , the @xmath0-matrix can always be understood as a classical ( convex ) mixture of a term which allows signaling from a to b with probability @xmath3 and a term which allows signaling from b to a with probability @xmath4 . the possibility for a and b to share an entangled state with no - signaling correlations",
    "is also included in equation .",
    "one particular causally nonseparable process is the ` quantum switch ' .",
    "this is a quantum system with an auxiliary degree of freedom which can coherently control the order in which operations are applied .",
    "the quantum switch provides quantum computational advantages with respect to quantum circuits with fixed gate order @xcite and has recently been implemented with linear optics @xcite .",
    "the processes studied up to now are limited to finite - dimensional hilbert spaces @xcite . in this paper",
    "we generalize the formalism to infinite - dimensional hilbert spaces , where the external degrees of freedom of the system , such as position and momentum , can be investigated .",
    "these degrees of freedom have a more direct correspondence with the properties of space and time and provide a link between our operational definition of causality and causality understood in terms of spacetime intervals between events .",
    "moreover , continuous variables are a natural way to pave the path for a formulation of quantum fields on indefinite causal structures .    here",
    "we characterize the @xmath0-matrix for infinite - dimensional quantum systems using a phase - space representation in terms of wigner functions .",
    "this approach is suited to deal with infinite dimensions , in contrast to the straightforward generalization of the approach used in finite dimensions , which leads to singularities as the dimensions go to infinity .",
    "we also show that the notion of causal nonseparability is maintained in infinite dimensions and we describe a causally nonseparable process , the quantum switch .",
    "specifically , we provide an argument for the causal nonseparability of the switch in infinite dimensions and show that it exhibits interference due to the superposition of the order in which the operations are applied .",
    "we consider two local observers , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , each provided with a local laboratory and free to perform local operations on a quantum system .",
    "these are represented as completely positive ( cp ) maps @xmath7 , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 , @xmath10 , are the ( infinite - dimensional ) input and output hilbert spaces of each laboratory and @xmath11 denotes the space of linear operators on the hilbert space @xmath12 .",
    "each map @xmath13 describes transformations of a state @xmath14 with outcome @xmath15 and output state @xmath16 . a convenient way of representing cp maps is through the choi - jamiolkowski ( cj ) isomorphism ( see @xcite for the original definition in finite dimensions , @xcite for the extension to infinite dimensions ) , which associates an operator @xmath17 to a cp map @xmath18 through @xmath19 . here",
    "@xmath20 is the non - normalized maximally entangled state in @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the identity operator .",
    "since the probability of obtaining an outcome is unity , the sum over all possible @xmath18 is a completely positive trace - preserving ( cptp ) map .",
    "this condition , which we refer to as cptp condition , is expressed in terms of the cj equivalent @xmath23 as @xmath24 .",
    "the process matrix is an operator @xmath25 such that @xmath26 and the probability of two measurement outcomes @xmath15 and @xmath27 is @xmath28.\\ ] ] the probability should satisfy @xmath29 . in particular , the condition @xmath30 implies that @xmath31=1 $ ] for every pair of cptp maps @xmath32 . from now on we will only consider the cj representation of the cp maps .    in the original formulation @xcite in finite - dimensional hilbert spaces",
    "the characterization of the process matrix heavily relies on the dimension of the hilbert spaces of the observers , so that taking the representation of @xmath0 and letting the dimensions tend to infinity would lead to singularities .",
    "therefore a straightforward generalization to infinite dimensions is not possible .",
    "an alternative formulation , suitable for the case considered , is given in terms of wigner functions , which provide an equivalent description to the usual operator representation .",
    "we will see that the requirement that @xmath0 gives rise to consistent probabilities restricts the possible wigner representations .",
    "the one party scenario can be obtained from the two parties when the hilbert spaces of one observer are one - dimensional .",
    "the wigner equivalent of a cptp map @xmath33 ( we omit here the index relative to the observer ) and of a process matrix @xmath0 is a function of four variables on the phase space , namely @xmath34 and @xmath35 . here",
    "the subscripts @xmath36 and @xmath37 refer respectively to the input and output hilbert space and the quantity @xmath38 corresponds to the point in the phase space @xmath39 . in terms of wigner functions , the cptp condition becomes @xmath40 . by computing the fourier",
    "transform @xmath41 , with @xmath42 , the previous condition reads @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 is the dirac delta function .",
    "we use the cptp condition to characterize the @xmath0-matrix . in terms of the wigner representation",
    "the normalization of probability @xmath46 is @xmath47 for each @xmath48 we identify a small interval @xmath49 around @xmath50 where we can approximate @xmath51 with @xmath52 .",
    "we assume that the function @xmath53 has a well - defined limit at @xmath54 .",
    "for all possible @xmath51 we choose the smallest interval @xmath55 .",
    "we set @xmath56\\times \\left [ -\\frac{\\delta}{2},\\,\\frac{\\delta}{2}\\right]$ ] .",
    "we now split our integral in two parts : in the first one the output variables are integrated over @xmath57 ; in the second one the integration is performed on @xmath58 . by using equation in the integral on @xmath57 , equation reads @xmath59 where @xmath60 . note that , in order to satisfy equation , @xmath61 can not diverge faster than @xmath62 .",
    "this implies that for all possible @xmath51 , restricted to the domain @xmath63 , the second term in the sum is always equal to the same constant .",
    "this can only happen if the second term in the sum in equation vanishes , so we conclude that @xmath64 when @xmath65 and @xmath66 when @xmath67 .",
    "we now send @xmath68 and @xmath45 to zero . in the limit",
    "we find @xmath69 where @xmath70 is a function to be determined .",
    "we now ask which conditions @xmath71 should satisfy in order for the probability to be normalized .",
    "if we substitute the result in the condition for the normalization of the probability we see that @xmath72 . moreover , we can write the complete expression for the wigner function as @xmath73 . the wigner equivalent of the @xmath0-matrix does not depend on the variables of the second hilbert space . in the operator representation",
    "this result is equivalent to having the identity in the second hilbert space .",
    "this is compatible with the finite - dimensional case shown in @xcite .",
    "moreover , computing the partial trace on the first system leads to @xmath74 .",
    "this means that in @xmath75 the @xmath0-matrix is a state with unit trace .",
    "therefore , the most general form of the total @xmath0 for the one - party case is @xmath76 , consistent with the finite - dimensional case .",
    "in the bipartite case the wigner equivalent of the @xmath0-matrix is a function of eight variables in the phase space @xmath77 , where the notation is consistent with the previous case .",
    "the probability normalization in terms of the fourier transform of the wigner equivalents of the operators is @xmath78 where the cptp condition for @xmath79 and @xmath80 is described by equation .",
    "consider now a specific local operation for one of the two parties , say alice , given by @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the characteristic function over the set @xmath83 , @xmath84 when @xmath85 , @xmath86 otherwise .",
    "@xmath83 is a two - dimensional set defined as @xmath87\\times \\left [ -\\frac{1}{2\\alpha_2},\\frac{1}{2\\alpha_2 } \\right]$ ] and @xmath88 are two arbitrary positive numbers .",
    "this choice of the measurement satisfies the cptp condition for all @xmath89 . by inserting this in equation",
    "we obtain @xmath90 if we now let @xmath91 be very large , but still finite , we can approximate @xmath92 with the product of two delta functions , so that we can perform the integration in @xmath93 by evaluating the @xmath0-matrix in the origin .",
    "therefore , the condition to impose on the total @xmath0 to have an integral converging to a constant ( one ) is @xmath94 whenever @xmath85 and @xmath95 otherwise .",
    "@xmath96 is the reduced @xmath0 of the observer b. as a consequence , in the limit @xmath97 we obtain @xmath98 .",
    "the previous equation describes exactly the one - party case , so we can apply the result and write @xmath99 this decomposition of @xmath100 is correct only if @xmath93 is arbitrarily close to the origin .",
    "if we now repeat the same procedure by swapping the measurements of alice and bob we find an analogous condition @xmath101 which holds when @xmath102 is arbitrarily close to the origin .",
    "we now go back to the equation for the normalization of probability . similarly to the one - party case , we define two intervals @xmath103\\times \\left [ -\\frac{\\delta_a}{2},\\frac{\\delta_a}{2 } \\right ] \\in \\mathbb{r}^2 $ ] and @xmath104\\times \\left [ -\\frac{\\delta_b}{2},\\frac{\\delta_b}{2 } \\right ] \\in \\mathbb{r}^2 $ ] , where we can approximate the functions @xmath105 and @xmath106 with their values in respectively @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "we can now split the probability condition in four parts , writing the integrals over @xmath109 and @xmath110 as the sum of an integral over @xmath111 and @xmath112 and on the rest of the integration region @xmath113 and @xmath114 . using the cptp condition for the local operations",
    "we find @xmath115 where @xmath116 here , @xmath117 are two constants and the notation for the last term is analogous to the one used in the one - party case . @xmath118 and @xmath119 are identically zero because the delta functions vanish in the interval . since the integral is equal to the same constant for all local operations we conclude that the fourth term is zero in the interval considered . to do this , the @xmath0-function should be zero outside @xmath120 or @xmath121 , at least in one of the outputs .",
    "setting @xmath100 equal to zero in the input would instead lead to the trivial solution @xmath95 . by taking the limit",
    "when the intervals @xmath122 reduce to a point , and following an analogous procedure to the one - party case , it is possible to show that the @xmath0-matrix is a delta function at least in one of the two outputs . applying the inverse fourier transform , in the original variables @xmath38 the conditions on the @xmath0",
    "imply that the wigner equivalent of the process matrix can not depend on both outputs at the same time , i.e. @xmath123 or @xmath124 . as we have already pointed out in the one - party scenario ,",
    "this condition is equivalent to having an identity in at least one of the two output hilbert spaces when @xmath0 is represented in the space of linear operators on the tensor product of the four hilbert spaces .    to summarize",
    ", we have shown that the bipartite @xmath0 allows for three different situations .",
    "the first case is described by a shared state between @xmath5 and @xmath6 in the input hilbert space , but identity in both output hilbert spaces , i.e. @xmath125 .",
    "this corresponds to no - signaling between the two observers .",
    "the second and third case describe signaling from one observer to the other . in this case",
    "the @xmath0-matrix is written as @xmath126 when b signals to a , or as @xmath127 when a signals to b. for further discussion on the specific form of these terms see @xcite .",
    "at time @xmath128 and is sent in a superposition of two paths .",
    "each path , realized by sending the particle through a fiber ( solid and dotted line in the figure ) , enters the two laboratories a and b in a fixed order and is detected by c at time @xmath129 after exiting the two laboratories . in each local laboratory",
    "the state undergoes local quantum operations described as measurement and repreparation .",
    "the probability of measurement outcomes shows an interference pattern due to the superposition of two causal orders .",
    "the interference can not be reproduced from local operations performed in a fixed causal order . ]",
    "a scheme of the quantum switch is provided in figure [ fig : switch ] .",
    "the switch involves three local observers , which we denote as a , b and c. the observers perform local quantum operations , here chosen to be a measurement followed by a repreparation of a quantum state . outside the laboratories the system propagates along two `` fibers '' ( solid and dotted line in figure [ fig : switch ] ) .",
    "a quantum state @xmath130 is prepared at time @xmath128 and sent in a superposition of two paths . in one of the paths the particle enters laboratory a at time @xmath131 and laboratory b at time @xmath132 ; in the second path the order of the operations a and b is reversed . after exiting the laboratories",
    "a and b the system is detected by the observer c at time @xmath129 .",
    "note that in order to preserve the coherence of the process the measurements should not reveal the time .",
    "the switch describes a quantum process in which the order of the local operations is in a superposition . in finite dimensions",
    "it has been proved that the @xmath0-matrix which describes the switch is causally nonseparable @xcite , i.e. it can not be written as @xmath133 , where c always comes after a and b and @xmath134 . here",
    "we generalize the switch to infinite dimensions , and provide an alternative proof of its causal nonseparability .",
    "the @xmath0-matrix is an operator acting on the tensor product of six hilbert spaces , @xmath135 .",
    "the first five spaces are infinite - dimensional and @xmath136 is a two - dimensional hilbert space spanned by the vectors @xmath137 and @xmath138 , which label each of the paths ( fibers ) taken by the particle ( see figure [ fig : switch ] ) .",
    "the w - matrix of the switch is pure and can be written as @xmath139 , where @xmath140 , with @xmath141 .",
    "explicitly , @xmath142 here , @xmath143 is a normalized square - integrable function .",
    "the variables of the functions @xmath144 and @xmath145 , where the arguments parametrize the propagation along the fiber , are omitted in for simplicity .",
    "the total state @xmath146 is a superposition of two terms , decribed by @xmath147 and @xmath148 , which can be explicitly written as @xmath149 where @xmath150 is the green function between @xmath151 and @xmath152 and @xmath153 is the hamiltonian which generates the evolution along the fiber .",
    "consider now the local operations performed in a and b. suppose that each observer measures the state in a region @xmath154 ( @xmath155 ) of the whole laboratory a ( b ) .",
    "afterwards , the state is reprepared in @xmath156 ( @xmath157 ) .",
    "the choi - jamiokowski equivalent of this local operation in a s laboratory is @xmath158 .",
    "the intervals @xmath154 satisfy @xmath159 for @xmath160 and @xmath161 , where @xmath162 is the volume of the local laboratory .",
    "a similar expression is valid for the case of b. the observer c detects the state he receives by projecting it over the region @xmath163 of the volume of his laboratory @xmath164 and by recombining the two paths via a measurement on the @xmath165 basis . as a consequence ,",
    "the local operation performed by c is @xmath166 , where @xmath167 and it is implied that the output hilbert spaces of c are one - dimensional .    the probability of the measurement outcomes is then given by @xmath168 .",
    "for simplicity we first consider a density of probability @xmath169 such that @xmath170 .",
    "then we can write @xmath171,\\ ] ] where we can express the single terms in the sum by adopting a vector notation with @xmath172 and @xmath173 , @xmath174    assuming @xmath175 , we can show that @xmath176 describes a two - way signaling from a to b to c and from b to a to c. specifically , we show that the two terms @xmath177 and @xmath178 correspond to a process in which the order of the events is fixed .",
    "instead , @xmath179 is an interference term , due to the superposition of causal orders , describing a two - way signaling between the three observers . in order to show this we can sum over the outputs of the observers and show how the marginals depend on the settings @xmath180 of @xmath181 and @xmath182 of @xmath183 .",
    "we assume that the states @xmath184 and @xmath182 are prepared so that the probability of detection in the three local laboratories is almost one .",
    "this means that the integration over the volume of any local laboratory ( a , b or c ) can be extended to an integral over the whole space , since this would amount to adding a negligible term to the sum . defining @xmath185 the integral of the first term in equation , we find that @xmath186 , which means that a does not receive information from b and c. moreover , since @xmath187 , c receives information from b. finally , the fact that @xmath188 means that b receives information from a but not from c. therefore , we conclude that the probability describes a causally ordered process where a signals to b and b signals to c. the situation is symmetric under the exchange of a and b if we consider the integral of the second term in equation , @xmath189 .",
    "a probabilistic mixture of the two terms corresponds to a process with no fixed causal order , but causally separable in the sense previously discussed .",
    "in contrast , when the quantum switch is considered an additional interference term appears .",
    "the interference corresponds to @xmath179 in equation and it can be shown to be @xmath190 where @xmath191 and @xmath192 were defined in equations and . to show that there is two way signaling , we define @xmath193 @xmath194 and sum over the outputs of the three observers .",
    "we find that @xmath195 , so both a and b signal to c. moreover , the two conditions @xmath196 and @xmath197 mean respectively that b signals to a and c , and a signals to b and c. therefore , we conclude that there is two - way signaling .",
    "since the w - matrix is pure and the correlations can exhibit signaling in both directions a to b to c and b to a to c , we conclude that the process is causally nonseparable .    we have shown that the @xmath0-matrix formalism can be extended to infinite - dimensional hilbert spaces .",
    "we have also implemented an infinite - dimensional version of the quantum switch , deriving correlations which show that the process is causally nonseparable .",
