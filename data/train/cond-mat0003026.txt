    "kinetics of growth can be broadly classified into two categories ; nucleation and spinodal decomposition ( or continuous ordering ) .",
    "the former applies to situations where the initial state is metastable and the latter to where the initial state is unstable .",
    "the distinction becomes unclear near the limit of metastability and in systems where the concept of metastability itself is ill - defined .",
    "a class of systems where the definition of metastability becomes ambiguous is one where there is a fluctuation - driven first - order phase transition .",
    "a notable example of a system undergoing such a transition is a symmetric di - block copolymer .",

    "a theoretical model describing these transitions was proposed by brazovskii in 1975@xcite .",

    "it was shown by brazovskii , within a self - consistent hartree approximation , that the fluctuations destroy the mean - field instability and lead to a first - order phase transition@xcite .",

    "the stochastic langevin equation derived from the hamiltonian differs from the usual ginzburg - landau description@xcite because of the appearance of the unusual gradient term .",

    "the slope of the raw result from the gaussian case was used to normalize all of the data .",
    "another concern is that for an infinite continuous system this line should have an x - intercept at zero ; however , for the finite systems on a grid used in the simulations the x - intercept is slightly negative . to account for this ,",
    "all of the data is shifted over by an amount equal to that intercept .",
    "the importance of this shift will become apparent in the next paragraph when a scaling is applied and the values of the results around zero are magnified .",

    "since the theory is larger then the simulations and both are above the gaussian , our simulations suggest that the contributions to the two point function from diagrams not included in the hartree approximation serve to lower the overall correction to mean field theory .",

    "we would like to emphasize that the growth dynamics described above are qualitatively different from rapid nucleation in which the system quickly reaches the stable equilibrium state .",
    "a large value of @xmath93 , on the other hand , indicates a type of ergodicity breaking as the system takes a very long time to reach equilibrium .",

    "it can be argued that there is only a single parameter , @xmath102 , controlling the scale of fluctuations and , therefore , the two temperatures should be related , however , there is no obvious argument to suggest that they should be identical .",
    "the picture emerging from the dynamical renormalization is a natural extension of the effect of fluctuations on the static results of the brazovskii model . following a quench from a relatively high temperature to a temperature where @xmath33 is negative , the system is in a locally unstable region ( top of a hill ) . as the fluctuations grow with time ,",
    "the non - linear terms characterized by @xmath14 become important and they renormalize the curvature of the hill .",
    "this scenario is quite different from the usual picture of evolution in an adiabatic potential .",
    "further evidence for the dynamical scenario presented in the previous section comes from examining the long time evolution of the peak of the structure factor obtained from our numerical simulations and correlating that to snap shots of the system as it evolves .",
    "figure [ fig : s(q0 ) long time ] is a plot of the amplitude of the structure factor peak as it evolves . for shallow quenches , @xmath103the peak grows to an equilibrium value and does not evolve further .",

    "al . for 2-d systems @xcite .",
    "the last feature in the system is a final rise to an equilibrium value .",
    "this rise is a finite size affect is caused by the majority domain finally taking over the entire system .",
    "this being the case , the peak would not be expected to grow much since the difference between the value before and after this final evolution should only represent the surface area between the different domains .    for a quench depth of @xmath104 this time evolution",
    "can be compared to a series of system snapshots shown in figures [ fig : system snapshots1]- [ fig : system snapshots5 ] .",
    "these figures represent @xmath105 isosurfaces which would be the boundaries between the different microphases of the system . for early times",

    ", there still appear to be a few different ordered domains while just after the final growth , at @xmath107 , only one domain appears to be left in the system .",
    "thus we still have a consistent picture of slow but continuous domain growth in the system which is governed by the evolution of the 2nd order term as it goes from negative values to positive values .",
    "in the work presented above we have shown that analysis of the static free energy does not always provide an adequate description of the fluctuation driven dynamics . though figure [ fig : s(q0 ) long time ] shows features which are reminiscent of a first order phase transition , dynamical analysis of the renormalized coefficients suggest that a more complicated evolution is taking place .",
    "a similar situation occurs for the superconducting transition which is also a fluctuation - driven first - order transition@xcite .    in the present work we have paid close attention to the time evolution of the mass parameter and its effect on the evolution of the system at early times .",
    "the dynamical renormalization results also become tractable at times large compared to @xmath93 when the system has reached equilibrium .",
    "as pointed out earlier , one enters this regime fairly quickly for shallow quenches . at this stage ,",
    "the higher order terms in @xmath69 become important .",
    "the most interesting aspect of the renormalized theory is that the fourth - order term becomes non - local in time @xcite : @xmath108 and the integral of the kernel over all times leads to the brazovskii result for the renormalized fourth - order term .",
    "one can derive an `` effective '' langevin equation for the fields @xmath65 from the renormalized @xmath109 , and the above equation implies that this langevin equation has `` memory '' effects which appear in the non - linear term .",
    "this would lead to unusual behavior of the equilibrium correlations functions and might provide a distinctive signature of fluctuation - driven first - order transitions .",
    "we are in the process of investigating the effective equation for @xmath110 numerically .",
    "one obvious consequence of the non - local term is that the barrier to nucleation is dynamic and it is not valid to think of nucleation as tunneling through a fixed barrier .",
    "the situation is closer to the problem of quantum tunneling for many degrees of freedom where one also finds an effective equation which is non - local in time@xcite .",
    "another area of interest is the role of defects in the phase transition of the system",
    ". these will be important for very shallow quenches to just below the transition point and we have noted there presence when looking at snapshots of the system .",
    "these defects are reminiscent of the perforated lamellar phase described in reference @xcite .",
    "one way to study this is to use a directional order parameter measure introduced by bray et al.@xcite to study the 2d problem .",
    "this order parameter is similar to the order parameter for complex fluids and provides directional as well as density information .",
    "what it may show is that the local gradient terms are enhanced for negative values @xmath33 suggesting that perhaps there is a disordered to nematic transition in this region which others have suggested for 2d @xcite .",
    "we would like to close with a discussion of possible experimental systems where this dynamical scenario can be studied experimentally .",
    "since the effective @xmath14 is extremely small in rayleigh - benard systems the regime where the disordered state is metastable will probably be unaccessible . in di - block copolymers ,",
    "however , there should be a significant temperature range , below the mean - field transition , where the disordered state is locally stable and a study of the equilibrium , two - time correlation function should reveal the existence of the non - linear memory term .",
    "it might also be possible to observe unusual nucleation if the system parameters allow for @xmath111 to be higher than @xmath112 ."
