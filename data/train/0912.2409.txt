    "dynamical friction ( hereafter , df ) is an important physical process for a wide variety of dynamics , e.g. stellar dynamics , galaxy and planetary formation etc .",
    "that s why it is in great demand to seek deeper understanding of the nature of df . as a historical milestone ,",
    "@xcite has succeeded in formulation of the effect of df . however , several approximations were unavoidable in the derivation of the formula .",
    "the chandrasekhar formula was derived under the assumptions of uniform density and isotropic velocity field .",
    "moreover , interaction between a perturber and field particles was supposed to be integration of countless two - body interactions and orbital periodicity of all particles was not taken into account . by efforts of many numerical studies , current astrophysicists have realized that the chandrasekhar formula is not perfect and loses accuracy of the estimation in some cases ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "in this paper , i concentrate on the suppression of df on a globular cluster ( hereafter , gc ) in a cored halo of dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , the discussion in this paper can be generalized to other astronomical bodies by scaling physical units .",
    "the drag force by df is negligibly weak for gcs in large systems , like our galaxy .",
    "in contrast , in small systems like dwarf galaxies , the drag force is far too strong ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "thus , the gcs in dwarfs are presumed to lose their orbital energy and fall into the galactic centre by strong friction force in time - scale of the order of @xmath0 gyr @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , these gcs still do exist in many dwarf galaxies even now and are as old as the age of universe ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "this problem is referred to as ` _ _ the dynamical friction problem _ _ ' .",
    "however , a solution of the problem has been proposed .",
    "if dwarf galaxies have a cored dark matter halo which has a constant density region in its centre , the df against the halo is weakened considerably , and gcs should be able to survive beyond the age of the universe . by an analytical approach using the chandrasekhar formula",
    ", @xcite discovered that a king - model halo can weaken the df in the core region .",
    "recently , by n - body simulations , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite confirmed complete cessation of df in a core region of haloes .",
    "thus , although the chandrasekhar formula indicates gradual shrinkage of the gc orbit , the n - body simulations demonstrate complete defunctionalization of df .",
    "this discrepancy between analytic and numerical studies ( the chandrasekhar formula and n - body simulations ) still remains . besides , the cessation of df is a topic not restricted to dwarf galaxies and gcs .",
    "@xcite has discussed the same core - stalling of df on binary black hole against a cored stellar cluster and suggested that fluctuation of the halo potential weakens the df in the core .",
    "my goals in this paper are to clarify hidden physics in the nature of df and the mechanism of the df suppression in cored density profiles by n - body simulations .",
    "constant density distribution is called , in other words , ` harmonic oscillator potential ' , which means that all particles in the potential have the same orbital period . in this sense ,",
    "harmonic potentials are expected to induce complex effects in non - linear manner and be beyond the applicable domain of the chandrasekhar formula .",
    "it has been known for a long time that df shows curious behaviors in constant densities .",
    "@xcite analytically argued that a constant density core causes energy feedback on a perturber by dynamical resonance in positive or negative sense depending on the density distribution . in the same context as @xcite",
    ", @xcite indicated that density response of the density field to a perturber orbiting in the core region can exert torque on the perturber and drive the orbital motion .",
    "moreover , @xcite also analytically argued that in the harmonic potentials the perturber acts as a catalyst for the evolution of the energy distribution of the field particles by the orbital resonance .    by the way , the cored dark haloes are inconsistent with results of cosmological n - body simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , among small scale galaxies , many observations of low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies have confirmed the cored dark haloes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "thus , i find that most of the p - horn particles are orbiting behind the gc , whereas , the n - horn particles are orbiting ahead of the gc . moreover , since most of these particles have short distances from the gc and the prograde rotations , i can ascribe the horn - feature in fig.[fig3 ] to the similarity between orbits of the horn particles and the gc .",

    "the p - horn particle in this figure approaches the gc from behind .",
    "the orbit expands when catching - up , and finally retreats from the gc after the orbital expansion .",
    "this orbital expansion corresponds to the energy increase seen in fig.[fig3 ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the orbit of the n - horn particle is the reverse , comes close to the gc ( in inertia coordinate , the gc is catching up to the n - horn particle ) , shrinks the orbital radius , and runs away from the gc . as a result , the energy of the n - horn particle decreases .",
    "the mechanism of these orbital behaviors is simple . under density gradients ,",
    "generally , inner orbits have shorter orbital periods , on the other hand , outer ones have longer periods .",
    "the p - horn particle is pulled forward by gravity of the gc , and gains energy .",
    "however , this energy increase causes the orbital expansion and makes angular velocity slow . in the case of the n - horn particle , the particle is pulled backward and decrease the energy . this energy decrease results in the orbital shrinkage and faster angular velocity .",
    "this phenomenon , that the particle slows down in azimuth when pulled forward and speeds up when held back , has come to be called ` the donkey effect ' @xcite .",
    "the orbits in fig.[rp_t2 ] imply that higher energy particles lose orbital energy , on the other hand , lower energy particles gain energy .",
    "this behavior can be confirmed in fig.[fig3 ] , which indicates that the two horns lean slightly from top - left to bottom - right .",
    "@xcite has also investigated this kind of orbital motion ( trojan horseshoe orbits ) in n - body systems , which look like the orbits in fig.[rp_t2 ] ( see * ? ? ? * fig.7 ) .",
    "it is worthy of special mention that these orbits exhibit quite different behavior from two - body interaction that is assumed in the derivation of the chandrasekhar formula .",
    "this orbital behavior of the horn particles is presumed to be caused by many - body interaction , rather than two - body interaction ( see , appendix a ) .",
    "means energy injection into the gc , decrease means energy absorption from the gc.,width=317 ]    to probe the energy transfer from the horn particles to the gc , i rerun the same simulation while calculating mechanical work on the gc , @xmath63 this integration means cumulation of the integrand on each timestep .",
    "@xmath64 represents net acceleration exerted on the gc by a specific particle group ( e.g. the p- , n - horn or the other particles ) .",
    "i compute energy transfers on the gc in the same simulation and show the result in fig.[fig5 ] .",
    "though the horn particles were defined by energy change during 2 - 3 gyr , i draw the energy transfers during t=1.5 - 3.5 gyr in fig.[fig5 ] ; setting @xmath65 gyr in eq.[de ] . in agreement with a naive expectation",
    ", i find that the p - horn particles absorb energy from the gc and the n - horn particles inject energy into the gc .",
    "it is notable that the behaviors of the injection and absorption are monotonic .",
    "the transfers are sharp in 2 - 3 gyr , slow in @xmath66 gyr and @xmath67 gyr .",
    "this implies that the energy transfers are transient .",
    "but setting @xmath68 gyr in eq.[de].,width=317 ]    the energy transfers in fig.[fig5 ] do nt completely balance ; however , the energy absorption by the p - horn particles slightly surpasses the injection by the n - horn .",
    "i compare the energy transfer on the gc by both of the p- and n - horn particles with that by the other particles in fig.[fig6 ] .",
    "the figure indicates that the other particles also steal energy from the gc .",
    "this energy loss of the gc seems to be caused by df against the other field particles except the horn particles .",
    "interestingly , the energy loss caused by the horn particles is comparable to that by the other particles , accounting for a half of actual df by all particles .",
    "the dotted line labelled as ` chandrasekhar formula ' is calculated by substituting eq.[chandra ] for @xmath64 in eq.[de ] using the data of gc orbit in the simulation .",
    "the df from all particles is well fitted by the chandrasekhar formula with @xmath35 this result implies that actual df can be separated into two modes .",
    "the first mode is the well - known conventional df based on the concept of @xcite .",
    "this is a df that is attributed to random encounters with a myriad of field particles in an isotropic velocity distribution . on the other hand , unlike the first mode , the cause of the second mode is a small number of particles which are in many - body interaction ; the horn particles .",
    "the horn particles have only 0.0354 per cent of the total mass of the system .",
    "however , keep in mind that the criterion for defining the horn particles is somewhat arbitrary .",
    "moreover , the result in fig.[fig6 ] does nt necessarily mean that df caused by ` _ _ true _ _ ' many - body interacting particles accounts for a half of the actual df . even in two - body interaction ,",
    "if a field particle has a similar velocity vector to @xmath69 and a small impact parameter , the particle causes strong interaction and large energy transfer .",
    "there would be no clear - cut way to extract only the true many - body interacting particles .",
    "however , it is sure that the horn particles defined in fig.[fig3 ] include many many - body interacting particles .      for @xmath70 gyr",
    ", the df does nt seem to act on the gc to shrink the orbit .",
    "this phenomenon itself has already been known .",
    "@xcite found that this core - stalling of df can be explained by the chandrasekhar formula .",
    "however , their estimation was based on the assumption of completely constant density in the core . without this assumption , the chandrasekhar formula predicts slow but certain orbital shrinkage @xcite , as seen in fig.[fig1 ] .    on the other hand ,",
    "the n - body simulations indicate the complete suppression of the df in the cored region . the chandrasekhar formula is no longer viable in this phase .",
    "@xcite has suggested that the mechanism of the df suppression is anisotropic velocity distribution induced by the gc .",
    "they attributed the df suppression to increase of number of particles in ` co - rotating state ' , in which more field particles rotate with the gc in prograde direction than initial isotropic state .",
    "@xcite , however , revealed that the increase of co - rotating particles is marginal and anisotropy induced by the gc is very weak .",
    "besides , @xcite suggested that fluctuation of the halo potential weakens the df in the core .",
    "but , they supposed the case of a black hole and a stellar cored structure , the perturber being so heavy that their theory is not applicable to the case of a dwarf galaxy and gcs .",

    "this figure indicates very complex orbits .",
    "both particles come close to the gc from the front , come inside the gc orbital radius , rotate around the gc , expand the orbits and finally go away behind the gc .",
    "it seems as if the particles dodge the gc .",
    "although these particles are respectively defined as a p- and a n - horn particle , these orbits are identical .",

    "orbital period becomes independent of orbital radius . in coming close to the gc",

    "after getting behind the gc , the particles are pulled forward by the gc and gain energy .",

    "these cumulative transfers , however , indicate periodic flapping .",
    "this periodicity appears just in 1 gyr period , implying an artificial effect caused by setting the time - interval to calculate @xmath56 to be 1 gyr .    , but using 0.5gyr - interval to extract the gathered horn particles.,width=317 ]    therefore , i follow the same procedure to calculate @xmath56 with 0.5gyr - interval . the numbers of particles listed up are shown in the bottom of table [ list_1gyr ] .",
    "i show cumulative energy transfers in fig.[et_0.5gyr - interval ] with an analytical estimation by chandrasekhar formula for the sake of comparison .",
    "however , the analytical estimation is halved , according to the result of  3.1 .",
    "the periodic flapping in fig.[et_1gyr - interval ] disappears .",
    "moreover , the energy injection from the horn particles are monotonic for @xmath77 gyr .",
    "the energy absorption by the other particles is also monotonic .",
    "interestingly , the behavior of the energy transfer from the horn particles is largely different from that in the exerting df phase ; the horn , many - body interacting , particles continue to inject energy into the gc in the suppressed df phase . on the other hand ,",
    "the other particles absorb energy from the gc as well as in the exerting df phase .",
    "the halved analytic formula provides excellent fit to the absorption for @xmath77 gyr though there is a slight deviation at @xmath78 gyr .",
    "these influences from horn and the other particles are canceled out and the gc orbit can remain on a constant orbital radius as if the df on the gc vanished .",
    "by the n - body simulation in this paper , i conclude as follows . in the exerting df phase , the chandrasekhar formula seems good at estimating the actual df .",
    "nevertheless , quantitatively , a very small number of particles accounts for a non - negligible fraction of the actual df although they occupy less than 0.1 per cent of the halo mass .",
    "these particles are in many - body interaction , which have quite different orbits from two - body interaction .",
    "the presence of such many - body interacting particles disagrees with the concept of @xcite .",
    "however , in his formula , uncertainty of determining @xmath79 would conceal the contribution from these particles .    in the suppressed df phase , the many - body interacting particles alter direction of energy transfer and feed energy into the perturber .",
    "on the other hand , the other particles exert df , the orthodox df , ceaselessly . in this phase , as a result , these energy transfers cancel out with each other .",
    "the orbit of the perturber is thus stabilized .",
    "i suggest that this could be a possible mechanism of the suppressed df in a constant density structure .",
    "although my results indicate a failure of the chandrasekhar formula , this is not surprising .",
    "the derivation of the formula has assumed an unrealistic circumstance : uniform density , isotropic velocity field and non - periodic straight orbit .",
    "moreover , a perturber in a real galaxy has to rotate around center of the galaxy .",
    "therefore , from the very beginning it is unreasonable to apply the chandrasekhar formula to all kinds of density distributions .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have analytically suggested energy feedback on a perturber by density response of field .",
    "especially , figures in @xcite are very intelligible schematically .",
    "he indicated shapes of density wakes . in his results , outside core region ,",
    "the density wake is asymmetric and exerts drag force on the perturber . on the other hand , inside the core ,",
    "the wake become symmetric and the drag force disappears .",
    "the symmetric shape is similar to the distribution of the horn particles in my fig.[t7-t8_positions ] although the horn particles in my simulation is selected by energy response , not density .",
    "however , in my simulation , the symmetric density wake indicated in @xcite can not be observed in the suppressed df phase .",
    "besides , the n - body simulations of @xcite , almost the same simulations as mine , also do nt indicate the symmetric density wake , but asymmetric wake ( see fig.4 of @xcite ) even inside the core region .",
    "@xcite also showed similar asymmetric desity wake in their fig.5 .",
    "this discrepancy may or may not be caused by low resolution in our simulations .",
    "also , @xcite has suggested that the field particles on circular orbits lose or gain energy according to the relative phase to the orbit of the perturber while the perturber plays the role of a catalyst to modify the distribution function of the field particles and induces anisotropy .",
    "the result of this paper indicates that not only two - body interactions but also many - body interactions are responsible for the actual df .",
    "the many - body interacting particles , horn particles , are very small in number and co - rotating with the perturber .",
    "moreover , the resistance to the df by this corrective effect is also feasible in shallow cusp density profiles although the shallow cusp may evolve into a constant density ( see , appendix a ) .",
    "this implies sensitivity of the actual df to velocity field of the halo models .",
    "i employed in this paper the isotropic assumption , @xmath80 in eq.[jeans ] , as the most fundamental model .",
    "however , many numerical simulations have suggested dependence of @xmath19 on radius in dwarf and other galaxies @xcite .",
    "these results imply that actual df against a _ live _ halo would depend sensitively on the distribution functions of the haloes .",
    "in addition , there are some generalised applications of the chandrasekhar formula ; against aspherical distributions @xcite , variable @xmath79 @xcite , df on spherical bodies @xcite , in a gaseous medium(e.g . * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "the green line indicates a equipotential surface between the effective potentials at l2 and l3 : @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "this green line runs through around the gc just like the horn - particle orbits in fig.[rp_t7 ] .",
    "if field particles have a jacobi integral higher than @xmath91 and lower than @xmath92 , some of these can orbit along this green line .",
    "i consider the particles shown in fig.[rp_t7 ] to be examples of this kind of particle .",
    "special attention should be paid to the fact that the effective potential at l2 ( the solid white line ) is lower than that at l3 ( the dashed white line ) .",
    "this height relation between @xmath91 and @xmath92 permits appearance of orbits like fig.[rp_t7 ] . on the other hand , in cases of cuspy density distribution , @xmath91 is generally higher than @xmath92 ( see below ) .    in fig.[tadpole",

    "therefore , force against df becomes strong toward inner region , at a certain radius , the force balances with the df on the gc .",
    "this means that the df suppression is not attributed anisotropic velocity state induced by the gc rotation : co - rotating state suggested by @xcite .",
    "@xcite has shown that such a co - rotating anisotropic velocity state is very marginal .",

    "although the horn - particles i suggest are co - rotating particlles in a sense , but _ there is no need to induce the anisotropy _ in the velocity field .",
    "this is consistent with the marginally anisotropic velocity distribution found by @xcite .",
    "next , i address the cases of shallow cusp density distibutions by means of the circular restricted three - body problem .",
    "some studies have concluded that actual dark matter profile of dwarf galaxies would have a shallow inner cusp with slopes between 0.3 - 0.6 @xcite . in order to investigate the cases of shallow cusps ,",

    "i assume that the gc with the mass of @xmath102 is orbiting at a separation of @xmath81 from the galactic center in a circular orbit .",
    "as i discussed above , some field particles can be in the special orbit ( fig.[rp_t7 ] ) if the effective potential on l3 point is higher than that on l2 .",
    "this fact implies that all i have to do is to calculate the effective potential on l3 and l2 .",

    "fig.[a1 ] shows the effective potential in the case of @xmath99 . in this case , the effective potential on l3 is higher than that on l2 .",
    "i expect that some horn particles in the special orbit would be existent",

    "i show the effective potential in the case of @xmath103 in fig.[a2 ] .",
    "the position of the gc , the scale radius , @xmath4 , and other parameters are the same .",
    "the effective potential on l3 is still higher than that on l2 .",
    "however , the difference between these is very small in comparison with the previous case",
    ". only a minority of particles can be in the special orbit if @xmath103 . in this case",
    ", the horn particles may be unable to balance against the df on the gc .      from the discussion above",
    ", steeper inner slope of the density profile allows fewer particles to orbit in many - body interaction manner like fig.[rp_t7 ] .",
    "however , in this discussion , it is very difficult or impossible to investigate how many particles in this orbit are required to cancel out the df on the gc .",
    "after all , detailed investigation needs to operate n - body simulations .",
    "however , as @xcite has concluded , n - body simulation suffers from the decline of the inner cusp .",
    "then , i can not conclude what value of @xmath104 is the criterion of the df stalling in ( nearly ) cored density profiles .",
    "since steeper ( shallower ) cusp allows fewer ( more ) horn particles , the number of particles required to observe this kind of orbits in n - body simulations would depend on the inner slope . in the cases of steeper cusps , to operate n - body simulation needs more particles ."
