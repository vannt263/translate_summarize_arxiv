    "discovery of the first extrasolar planet around a sun - like star , 51 peg b @xcite , and subsequent detection of more than 850 exoplanets raises many questions about the formation and dynamics of planetary systems .",
    "now that we know of more than 120 multi - planet systems , a broad range of planetary system architectures have been sampled .",
    "this variegate ensemble offers a wide range of features that are not displayed by our solar system : giant planets in short period orbits ( `` hot jupiters '' ) , the wide eccentricity distribution of exoplanets , the relatively common detection of mean motion resonances ( mmrs ) in multiple planet systems offer interesting examples against which theories of planetary formation and evolution need to be tested ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "determining the physical processes that lead to the observed diversity of planetary systems remains an area of active research and debate .",
    "the discovery of dynamically quiescent , short - period multiplanet systems by the kepler mission , such as kepler 11 @xcite , provides clear evidence for disc - driven type i migration @xcite of bodies that probably formed beyond the ice line in their protoplanetary discs .",
    "similarly , giant planet systems in 2:1 mean - motion resonance such as gj 876 @xcite provide evidence for disc - driven type ii migration of gap - forming planets because of the slow convergent migration rates required for resonant capture , as do giant planets on short to intermediate period orbits that are too remote from their central stars to have undergone significant tidal evolution .",
    "the relatively large eccentricities observed for the extrasolar planet population as a whole , however , indicate that disc - planet interactions do not tell the whole story .",
    "a plausible explanation for many of these systems is that they formed on near - circular orbits in the disc , but after disc dispersal dynamical instability led to planet - planet gravitational scattering @xcite .",
    "evidence is provided by the fact that numerical planet scattering experiments can reproduce the observed eccentricity distribution successfully @xcite , and the observation that a number of short - period transiting planets have orbit planes inclined significantly with respect to the stellar equatorial plane @xcite .",
    "further ideas for explaining eccentric orbits include eccentricity driving through disc - driven migration of a resonant pair of planets @xcite , and sweeping secular resonances caused by various combinations of protoplanetary disc dispersal , spin - down of an initially rapidly spinning oblate central star , and general relativistic precession @xcite .",
    "the three - planet extrasolar system hd 181433 has an architecture that makes it an interesting test - bed for exploring dynamical processes during and after planetary system formation .",
    "@xcite report that the system consists of two outer gas giant planets ( ` @xmath0 ' and ` @xmath1 ' ) on eccentric orbits with periods @xmath11 and @xmath12 days , and an inner super - earth on a @xmath13 day orbit with eccentricity @xmath14",
    ". dynamical analysis of this system indicates that the parameters reported by @xcite lead to global instability on very short time scales @xcite .",
    "long - term stability requires the two outer planets to be in 5:2 mean motion resonance .",
    "parameters that lead to a minimum @xmath15 value of 4.96 for the orbital fits to the data are given in table  1 , and these are the parameters of the system that we adopt in this paper .",
    "it is noteworthy that planet @xmath8 is dynamically isolated from the outer planets such that gravitational interaction over secular time scales is unable to excite the observed eccentricity of this body .    the best fit parameters presented in @xcite and reported in table  1 lead to the 5:2 resonant angles librating with large amplitude .",
    "disc driven migration scenarios for resonant capture of giant planets normally result in capture in low - order resonances with relatively small libration amplitudes @xcite .",
    "planet - planet scattering , however , may also result in resonant capture into higher order resonances with large libration amplitudes @xcite , and this would appear to be a more probable explanation for the currently inferred orbital parameters for the two outer planets @xmath0 and @xmath1 .    in this paper , we present a case study of the evolution of the planetary system around hd 181433 , and explore plausible scenarios of how the observed large eccentricities may have been generated after depletion of the protoplanetary disk .",
    "in particular we focus on scenarios that can lead to the current observed orbital configuration of planet _",
    "b_. in section [ properties ] , we discuss the properties of the hd 181433 system , and study the locations of secular resonances and regions of stability . in section [ tides ] , we consider how tides may have influenced the evolution of the semi - major axis and eccentricity of planet _",
    "b _ over the life - time of the system . in section [ scattering ] , we explore the planet - planet scattering mechanism as a means of generating large eccentricities .",
    "we simulate the evolution in the presence of an additional giant planet whose role is to destabilise the system .",
    "we estimate the probability for planets _",
    "c _ and _ d _ to be captured into the 5:2 mmr after scattering , and thus consider the joint probability for both resonant capture into 5:2 and excitation of the eccentricity of planet @xmath8 . in section [ spin ]",
    ", we examine an alternative scenario in which sweeping of secular resonances induced by stellar spin - down force the eccentricity of hd 181433__b__. we study a range of initial stellar rotation periods and spin - down rates , and examine the effect of including additional terrestrial planets  whose presence we find to be necessary for the model to be successful . in section [ concl ]",
    "we briefly discuss and summarize our findings .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the mass of the host star is reported to be @xmath16 @xcite , its inferred radius is @xmath17 @xcite , while an age of @xmath18 gyr has been reported @xcite .",
    "hd 181433 is believed to be of spectral type k3iv , and has a spin period of 54 days @xcite .",
    "the orbital elements of the hd 181433 planets adopted in this paper are shown in table [ param ] .",
    "these values are quoted from the best - fit orbital solution that is dynamically stable obtained by @xcite .",
    "the orbital period of hd 181433__b _ _ is 9.4 days with an eccentricity of 0.39 . the longitude of hd 181433__b _ _ s periastron advances mostly due to the relativistic correction of the newtonian potential .",
    "being a close - in planet in eccentric orbit , hd 181433__b _ _ is undergoing tidal circularization .",
    "given the age of the system and the measured @xmath19 value , this suggests that planet _",
    "b _ has a tidal @xmath20 factor substantially larger than inferred for terrestrial planets in the solar system , for which @xmath21 ( e.g. murray & dermott 1999 ) .",
    "this point is discussed further in section  [ tides ] .",
    "the orbital parameter values quoted in table [ param ] are specific to a particular moment in time .",
    "in fact , resonant and secular interactions cause @xmath22 and @xmath23 to reach values as large as 0.52 and 0.50 , respectively @xcite . in this paper , when discussing the eccentricities acquired by planets during dynamical evolution we will report the maximum values acquired during numerical computations once final stable systems have been established .      before embarking on a detailed examination of the hd 181433 system , it is useful to present a qualitative description of the possible formation and evolution history .",
    "we envisage that the planets formed within a protoplanetary disc exterior to the snow - line .",
    "b _ appears to have characteristics of a neptune - like planet based on analysis of its tidal evolution ( see later in the paper ) .",
    "it seems likely that this body formed largely from material beyond the snow - line and migrated in by type i migration , arriving at its observed location on a near - circular orbit .",
    "it is possible that it accreted during migration , possibly through giant impacts with other large bodies .",
    "if these occurred after migration was essentially complete then the body would be close to the star and the impactors would need to be at least as massive as the inferred minimum mass of _ b _ to generate significant eccentricity through scattering during the giant impacts phase .",
    "interactions and giant impacts with bodies in the earth - mass regime at semi - major axes @xmath24 au would lead to @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , we anticipate that planet _",
    "b _ was formed with a small free eccentricity .",
    "we anticipate that the outer giant planets _ c _ and _ d _ formed somewhat later than planet _ b _ , but were able to grow larger cores that enabled rapid gas accretion and formation of gas giant planets .",
    "although disc driven migration may have brought the planets into close proximity , it is unlikely that it was responsible for establishing the 5:2 resonance .",
    "disc - driven resonant locking tends to cause the resonant angles to librate with small amplitudes because the planets are pushed deep into the resonance , but planets _ c _ and _ d _ appear to be weakly embedded in the resonance @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite undertook a study of disc - driven resonant capture and only obtained a 5:2 resonance when one of the two planets already had a high eccentricity equal to 0.3 .",
    "a more plausible explanation for the resonance is capture as a result of planet - planet scattering , possibly involving an additional planet that was ejected during the dynamical instability @xcite . given the stabilisation provided by the eccentricity damping influence of the gas disc , this instability most likely occurred during the final stages of the disc life time or after it was dispersed altogether .",
    "the rest of this paper largely concerns the question of how planet _ b _",
    "s eccentricity was excited , and when addressing this we consider the following possibilities : scattering by a giant planet during the previously mentioned dynamical instability that created the 5:2 resonance ; by invoking the presence of an additional undetected planet in the system that enhances the forced eccentricity of planet _",
    "b _ ; passing planet _",
    "b _ through a secular resonance through the process of stellar spin - down from an initially rapidly rotating state .      for the purpose of undertaking a simplified analysis of the dynamical evolution of the hd 18433 planetary system ,",
    "we have implemented a laplace - lagrange secular model based on the discussion in chapter 7 of @xcite , assuming that all planets are coplanar . given the standard nature of this secular theory",
    ", we refer the interested reader to @xcite for description of the mathematical details .",
    "the disturbing function includes secular terms for the mutual gravitational interaction between all three planets that are second order in the eccentricities and first order in the masses .",
    "precession due to general relativity ( gr ) is also included ( e.g. see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but our model does not take account of the 5:2 mmr occupied by the two outer planets .",
    "although techniques have been developed to include first - order mmrs in secular treatments of planetary system evolution , this becomes significantly more involved technically for higher order mmrs because of the requirement to include terms that are higher order in the eccentricities .",
    "our purpose here is to use the secular theory as a rough guide to the dynamics of the system , and not to accurately predict its long term evolution , so this omission is not crucial here .",
    "this point is illustrated later in the paper where we demonstrate , by means of direct numerical simulations , that the eccentricity evolution of the two outer planets maintains highly regular and periodic behaviour , reminiscent of secular evolution ( see figure  [ ecc ] for example ) .",
    "it appears that the effect of the 5:2 mmr is rather weak , with the main influence being an alteration of the precession frequencies .",
    "the secular model , therefore , allows us to identify the existence and approximate locations of secular resonances , in addition to estimating the magnitudes of forced eccentricities experienced by additional low mass planets that may be present in the system today , or which were present in the past .",
    "all detailed analyses of the hd 181433 system dynamics undertaken in this paper use direct numerical simulations for accurate modelling of the mutual interactions , and all firm conclusions drawn about the past and future evolution are based on those simulations .",
    "the secular system we examine is based on the osculating orbital elements listed in table  [ param ] .",
    "the left - hand panel of figure [ analytic ] shows the variation of the free precession frequency @xmath26 experienced by a test particle located between 0 to 9 au . on the same diagram the three eccentricity - pericentre eigenfrequencies of the system",
    "are denoted by solid horizontal lines .",
    "they are ( in descending order ) @xmath27yr@xmath28 , @xmath29yr@xmath28 and @xmath30yr@xmath28 .",
    "note that in the absence of relativistic precession @xmath31yr@xmath28 , with the other eigenfrequencies that are largely determined by the outer planets being essentially unaffected .",
    "the intersections of the lines with the curve show where the eigenfrequencies @xmath32 equal @xmath26 , and identify the semi - major axes where large forced eccentricities can be expected . in the central panel of figure [ analytic ] ,",
    "the values of the maximum forced eccentricity are shown as a function of semi - major axis .",
    "the singularities close to 0.18 , 0.7 , 4.7 and 6.3 au represent locations where the value of @xmath26 is equal to one of the @xmath32 eigenfrequencies of the secular system , as anticipated above .",
    "this plot indicates that the system is more - or - less dynamically packed out to distances of @xmath33 au , in the sense that additional planets located in the system will experience large forced eccentricities that may be destabilising . even in the region between 0.20.6 au ( focus of the right - hand panel of figure [ analytic ] ) , where a clear minimum exists in the forced eccentricity , a value of @xmath34 is predicted .",
    "it is noteworthy that the habitable zone for this k3iv star is centred at @xmath35 au @xcite .",
    "we use the symplectic n - body code mercury-6 @xcite , augmented to include the effects of gr @xcite , to perform a direct integration of the system using initial conditions from table  [ param ] . unless stated otherwise , all simulations in this paper adopted the hybrid integrator option which utilises the second - order mixed - variable symplectic ( mvs ) algorithm for systems that are not strongly interacting , but switches to the bulirsch - stoer ( bs ) integrator when the minimum separation between objects @xmath36 hill radii .",
    "a time step of 1/20 of the orbital period of the innermost planets is adopted for the mvs integrator , and the bulirsch - stoer integrator is employed with an accuracy parameter of @xmath37 .",
    "figure [ gr ] shows two integrations of the system , one including the relativistic correction and one without it , and underlines how the relativistic correction for planet _",
    "b _ is not relevant with regard to the amplitude of @xmath9 , even if it is important with respect to the precession period .",
    "this differs from the @xmath38 system , where the forced eccentricity of the inner planet depends sensitively on whether or not the post - newtonian force is accounted for in secular evolution @xcite because of the proximity of a secular resonance .",
    "while the loose residence of planets c and d in the 5:2 mean motion resonances introduces some short - term oscillations , the eccentricity evolution of the system over longer periods appears regular and well - described by a simple three frequency secular model .",
    "fourier analysis of the system s apsidal behaviour indicates that the main effect of the 5:2 resonance is to simply modify the values of the principal precession frequencies that describe the giant planets ( i.e. , @xmath39 and @xmath40 making it inaccessible for resonant interaction with @xmath41 ) .",
    "figure [ ecc ] shows the evolution of the eccentricities of the hd 181433 planets retrieved from the laplace - lagrange secular model ( left panel ) and the numerical integration ( right panel ) .",
    "the amplitudes of the eccentricity variation are very similar , while the periodicity of the eccentricity of _ c _ and _ d _ is approximately reduced of two thirds to @xmath42 years as result of the 5:2 mmr .",
    "this illustrates the accuracy with which the secular model estimates the locations of the secular apsidal resonance , in addition to the strong regularity displayed by the full integration even though the outer two planets are in the 5:2 mmr .",
    "it is clear that the effects of the 5:2 mmr in this system are rather weak and make only a modest change to the secular behaviour , namely through shifting the precession frequencies of the outermost planet _ d_.      to examine the consequences for an additional low mass planet in the system arising from the large forced eccentricities predicted in figure [ analytic ] , we have performed n - body simulations that include an additional planet .",
    "we place an earth - mass object ( which would be undetectable in current radial velocity surveys ) at different distances between planets _",
    "b _ and _ c _ to check for the stability of that region .",
    "the sampling used was of 0.05 au for semi - major axes in the range @xmath43 au and 0.1 au for semi - major axes in the range @xmath44 au .",
    "we find that in full n - body simulations , the secular resonance at 0.18 au moves inward leaving the region between 0.1 0.35 au stable for a single body , but unstable outside of this region .",
    "in particular , for semi - major axes",
    "@xmath45 au the forced eccentricity attains values @xmath46 . later in the paper",
    "we consider the influence of additional low mass planets , and we find that inserting two or three extra planets with at least one of them between 0.26 and 0.35 au makes the system unstable ( see section [ addpl ] ) .",
    "the close proximity of planet _",
    "b _ to its host star suggest it should be undergoing tidal evolution .",
    "tidal effects circularize planetary orbits on a time scale given by @xcite @xmath47 the value of @xmath20 calculated for rocky objects in the solar system is of the order of @xmath48 @xcite . such a value would imply a circularization time scale of the order of @xmath49 years for planet _",
    "b _ , much shorter than any reasonable estimate for the age of the system .",
    "if we reject the hypothesis that a recent event has generated the observed eccentricity , then the tidal factor @xmath20 must be considerably greater than expected for a terrestrial body of mass @xmath50 m@xmath51 .",
    "if we assume a @xmath20 value and density typical of an ice giant such as neptune ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 g @xmath54 ) , then the circularization time scale becomes @xmath55 gyr , comfortably longer than the estimated system age .",
    "this would make hd 181433__b _ _ a member of the class of low - mass , low - density , close - in planets exemplified by kepler 11c and kepler 11e @xcite . to uncover the history of planet _",
    "b _ and make an estimate for the orbital parameters that existed prior to significant tidal evolution , it is necessary to examine the influence of tides on past orbital evolution and estimate their influence of future evolution .",
    "we computed the orbital evolution for various pairs of values of @xmath60 ( ranging between @xmath61 and @xmath62 ) and @xmath59 ( between @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) .",
    "the chosen @xmath20 values span the range that are plausible .",
    "the rate of tidal damping may depend on the interior structure of the planet and is likely to be different for different planets .",
    "we integrate the equations for the age of the star backward in time ( 6.7 gyr ) and for 10 gyr into the future .",
    "results show that only when @xmath59 falls below @xmath63 does the behaviour change in a noticeable manner .",
    "we conduct our analysis using @xmath65 , which corresponds to the value for which @xcite have found the distribution of initial _",
    "e _ values of close - in planets to match that of the general population .",
    "the top panel of figure [ migration ] shows the migration of hd 181433__b _ _ for different values of @xmath66 , while in the bottom panel the evolution in @xmath56-@xmath57 space is presented ( obtained by assuming orbital angular momentum conservation ) . since both @xmath67 and @xmath68 scale @xmath69 , the rate of evolution is slower for larger initial values of @xmath56 , but speeds up dramatically as @xmath56 decreases .    a smaller @xmath60 means a larger range of values is spanned during the evolution for a fixed age of the system .",
    "for example , @xmath70 implies that during the early main - sequence stage planet _",
    "b _ would have had a semi - major axis of 0.15 au and an eccentricity almost equal to @xmath71 . however , assuming a current age of 6.7 gyr , complete circularization of the orbit will take much less than one more gigayear to be achieved ( with the migration terminating at about 0.07 au ) . without further detailed information about the system allowing us to constrain its physical nature ,",
    "this evolutionary track and associated @xmath66 value is equally probable as any others .",
    "our purpose here is to define a plausible initial state of the system prior to significant tidal evolution , and in doing so we make the assumption that we are observing the system close to the midpoint of its tidal evolution .",
    "a value of @xmath72 means that planet _",
    "b _ would have had initial values @xmath73 au and @xmath74 , and circularization would be completed within the next 10 gyr . as noted earlier , @xmath72 is similar to the values inferred for uranus and neptune @xcite .",
    "we find that a value @xmath75 leads to tidal effects that are almost negligible such that the observed values of @xmath76 and @xmath9 would be very similar to those 6.7 gyr ago . when considering mechanisms for exciting the eccentricity of planet _",

    "we consider the hypothesis that the eccentricities and resonant structure for the orbits of the outer planets were established after a period of dynamical instability once gas disc dispersal had occurred , and the eccentricity of planet _",
    "b _ was established through the sweeping of a secular resonance with the outer planets caused by the spin - down of the central star from an initial state of very rapid rotation .",
    "the idea that a short - period planet may experience excitation of its eccentricity and inclination because of stellar spin - down originates with @xcite .",
    "they showed that if the primordial gravitational field of the sun had a larger second - degree harmonic [ i.e. @xmath136 , equivalent to a rotation period @xmath137 hours , then subsequent solar spin - down would drive mercury s orbit through secular resonances capable of generating its large mean eccentricity and inclination .",
    "secular resonances are generated when the orbits of two bodies precess synchronously .",
    "a small body in secular resonance with a large planet will have its eccentricity and inclination modified over relatively short time periods .",
    "as the mass distribution of a planetary system evolves , for example as a result of gas disc dispersal , orbital migration or stellar spin - down , the locations of secular resonances move .",
    "planets located in regions through which the resonance sweeps are perturbed as the resonance drives the eccentricity and inclination . given that we assume the current orbits of the outer planets were established shortly after gas disc dispersal , stellar spin - down provides the resonant sweeping in our model , and the rate of eccentricity / inclination forcing scales with the square root of the stellar spin - down time @xcite . in principle",
    "it should therefore be possible to tune the spin - down time scale to obtain the desired eccentricity for planet _",
    "b_. there are other planetary systems with architectures similar to hd 181433 ( i.e. , a factor of @xmath138 in orbit period between the inner and outer planets , and an eccentric inner planet ) such as hd125612 and @xmath139 arae",
    ". the same arguments used to constrain the orbital history of the hd 181433 system may apply to these systems too .",
    "we are investigating the more general implications of these evolutionary tuning processes and their application elsewhere @xcite .",
    "stars are generally believed to lose their primordial angular momentum through the magnetic braking action of the stellar wind with a mass - loss rate orders of magnitude greater than that on the main sequence ( e.g. skumanich 1972 ) .",
    "pre - main sequence stars with masses over @xmath140 exhibit a bimodal period distribution with observed values clustered around 68 days and 2 days .",
    "the transition between the two peaks is fairly abrupt .",
    "t tauri stars can have spin periods of the order of hours during their evolution , with a significant fraction of them showing this characteristic .",
    "in addition to providing a method of exciting the eccentricity of an interior planet through resonant sweeping @xcite , stellar spin - down from an initial rapid state of rotation has also been invoked to explain the low eccentricity of an interior planet . using early system parameters for the then three planet @xmath38 system",

    "b _ could have been avoided leaving its eccentricity at a low level .",
    "our model differs in that we assume the eccentricities of the outer planets to have been established after gas disc removal rather than before or during its occurrence given its role in damping large planetary eccentricities ( e.g. papaloizou et al .",

    "we begin our analysis by modifying the laplace - lagrange secular model described in section  [ properties ] to account for stellar spin - down through inclusion of the @xmath141 contribution to the eigenfrequencies of the system .",
    "as previously remarked , the secular model provides only an approximate estimate of the locations of secular resonance and can therefore be used to quickly evaluate the hypothesis that a secular resonance may have swept the present - day semi - major axis of planet _",
    "b _ at 0.080 au during stellar spin - down .",
    "we adopt the method described in @xcite for including the @xmath141 terms , and we use the relation between the stellar spin period @xmath142 and @xmath141 provided by @xcite .",
    "the mass of planet _ b _ is much smaller than the outer two giants so we treat it as a test particle in the secular model .",
    "the left panel of figure [ sweep ] presents the free precession period of a test particle induced by planets _",
    "c _ and _ d_. it is important to point out the role of gr - induced precession in promoting secular resonances close to the star : neglecting gr , the precession rate would fade to zero very near to the star making it difficult to match any eigenfrequencies of the outer planet secular system ( see section [ properties ] for how precession rates change due to gr ) .",
    "the central and right plots in figure [ sweep ] show the sweeping of two secular resonances as the parent star spins down from a rotation period of 2 days to 30 days ( for which the @xmath141 effects become insignificant ) . according to this simplified model , when the rotation period of hd 181433 was @xmath143 days ( equivalent to @xmath144 ) , the free precession rate at the present location of planet _",
    "b _ matched the one of the eigenfrequencies of the system .",
    "later , the secular resonances move inward toward their present - day locations . using the argument that the eccentricity excitation due to the passage of a secular resonance is inversely proportional to the square root of the changing rate of the resonant frequency @xcite , we can estimate the spin - down time @xmath145 , where @xmath146 is the rotational angular velocity of the star required to excite the present eccentricity .",

    "we evaluate how a hypothetical interior terrestrial planet may have influenced the sweeping of the resonance .",
    "we consider a single earth - mass planet in circular orbit with semi - major axes in the range 0.03 - 0.055 au .",
    "we want to assess if the additional planet will be trapped long - term into the resonance with planet _",
    "b _ ( as in sect .  [ addpl ] ) , or if its presence will release _ b _ from the resonance with the required eccentricity .",
    "we prepare a set of 100 runs with planet _",
    "b _ initially located at 0.9 - 0.11 au so that close encounters may start when a high eccentricity has already been reached .",
    "each sub - set has its own stellar spin period for resonance capture .",
    "the particular behaviour depends on the individual run , but in general we observe that planets _",
    "b _ and _ x _ are not quite trapped into a mutual resonance but instead experience differential precession , with the precession periods differing by approximately 2000 years .",
    "we find that collisions do occur , but because of the slow differential precession it takes on the order of @xmath49 years for them to happen .",
    "figure [ int ] presents a successful case : the eccentricities of the two inner planets grow because of the passage of the resonance , the orbits cross each other , after 11 myr instability arises leading to a collision , leaving planet _",
    "b _ with the required eccentricity .",
    "although planet _",
    "b _ is initiated with a semi - major axis of 0.1 , the inelastic collision causes the composite planet to effectively migrate to 0.08 au , which is the observed value .",
    "orbital inclinations stay small in the system .",
    "to generate the resonance this simulation required a stellar rotation period @xmath195 hours .",
    "a set of simulations with @xmath196 au demands a stellar spin period of 11.3 hours . in these configurations",
    "the eccentricity stops growing and stabilizes around 0.45 as the secular resonance is disrupted .          in the previous section we showed that sweeping secular resonances due to stellar spin - down , combined with planet - planet scattering , can cause eccentricity excitation of planet _",

    "if the value @xmath198 is primordial then it implies a value of @xmath199 .",
    "a value of @xmath200 is inferred for neptune and uranus @xcite , and we showed in section [ tides ] that if such a value is adopted for hd 181433__b _ _ then the planet is approximately half - way through the process of circularising from an initial eccentricity of @xmath74 and semi - major axis @xmath201 .",
    "this raises the question of whether or not the sweeping secular resonance model with additional terrestrial - mass planets can also achieve an eccentricity this large , and we have addressed this issue below using a further batch of n - body simulations .    here",
    "the planet _",
    "b _ is placed further out so a shorter stellar spin period is required to generate the resonance .",
    "we infer that the star had to rotate in @xmath202 hours in order for the resonance to sweep the location of _ b_. using the nominal value of @xmath167 ( see equation [ down ] ) in a simulation consisting of planets _",
    "b _ , _ c _ and _ d _ only , @xmath9 peaks at 0.28 and stabilizes later around a value of 0.25 .",
    "if we reduce the stellar spin - down rate to be equal to or less than the nominal value by just 5.75 % , @xmath9 grows indefinitely as described above .",
    "our original aim was to test the possibility of breaking the secular resonance for planet _",
    "b _ by including three additional terrestrial planets orbiting beyond _ b _ , but the larger initial semi - major axis and larger final eccentricity required of @xmath203 mean that a stable system of three additional planets can not be set - up because the outer one orbits outside the stable zone located within 0.26 au ( see section [ properties ] and [ addpl ] ) .",
    "for this reason we ran a suite of simulations with two earth - mass planets orbiting outside of planet _ b_. the qualitative evolution is similar to that described in section [ addpl ] .",
    "an example of a successful simulation is displayed in figure [ 2ext ] , showing the growth of eccentricity through secular resonance , planet - planet scattering and collision , and two surviving inner planets with planet _",
    "b _ orbiting with @xmath204 and @xmath205 .",
    "the necessary stellar rotation period to generate the resonance is 11.6 hours .",
    "the rocky planet which survives at 0.16 au would be in the noise level of the measured radial velocities ( f - test value of 84% ) .",

    "b _ by strengthening coupling with the outer giant planets . by carefully choosing of the mass and location of an additional planet the forced eccentricity of planet _ b _ may be enhanced .",
    "we focus on the effect of a low mass planet near planet _",

    "we have already discussed in section [ stabadd ] that an additional planet can be stable in the region 0.1  0.35 au .",
    "we use the secular model to estimate the planetary mass required in this range in order for the precession period of @xmath8 to match that of @xmath0 or of the hypothetical planet .",
    "we then refine the solution by means of numerical simulations , setting the eccentricities of the extra planet and _ b _ to small non - zero values and examining the evolution of 75 configurations for 10 myr .",
    "the maximum forced eccentricity obtained for these runs was @xmath209 for a 12 earth mass companion orbiting at 0.35 au or for a 15 earth mass companion orbiting at 0.3 au .",
    "all other simulations have resulted in values of @xmath210 .",
    "for example , a 11 earth mass companion orbiting at 0.25 au resulted in a peak value of @xmath211 ( see left panel of figure [ eccexcit ] ) .",
    "we now consider the evolution when an extra planet is orbiting interior to @xmath8 .",
    "we use the secular theory to estimate the planetary masses required between 0.008  0.062 au for planet _",
    "b _ to experience a significantly enhanced forced eccentricity .",
    "results from this secular analysis indicate that an additional planet located at @xmath212 au must have a mass equal to 45 @xmath213 .",
    "an additional planet located at @xmath214 au must have a mass equal to @xmath215 .",
    "numerical integration of 40 initial configurations , covering the range of semi - major axes and @xmath216 discussed above , show again that @xmath9 is not forced sufficiently to explain the currently observed value of @xmath5 .",
    "the maximum forced eccentricity obtained was @xmath217 , this happened in two cases : a 1.5 earth mass companion orbiting at 0.041 au ( right panel of figure [ eccexcit ] ) and a 0.75 earth mass companion orbiting at 0.056 au .",
    "we assess the detectability of these hypothetical planets assuming a radial velocity precision of 1 m / s @xcite . in the range 0.1",
    " 0.35 au planets with mass as small as 46 @xmath218 would be detectable .",
    "this excludes the possibility of exciting a sufficiently large @xmath9 with an unseen planet in this region . in the inner zone ,",
    "the detection limit is about 2 earth - masses .",
    "this can not exclude the generation of a forced eccentricity of 0.21 .    if planet _",
    "b _ had been formed with a free eccentricity of @xmath219 then in principle the observed value of @xmath5 could have been obtained through excitation of a forced eccentricity equal to 0.21 .",
    "this value for the free eccentricity , however , is rather large for either of the two most plausible scenarios for the arrival of planet _",
    "b _ at its current location . gas - disc driven orbital migration of a fully formed planet _",
    "b _ to its observed location is likely to have left the planet in an essentially circular orbit . formation _ in situ _ through a series of giant impacts may have left the planet with a remnant free eccentricity , but a value of @xmath220 requires the scattering bodies during the giant impacts phase to be approximately 6 earth masses , which is only slightly smaller than the measured minimum mass of planet _",
    "we have investigated the dynamical evolution of the three - planet system orbiting the main sequence k - dwarf star hd 181433 @xcite .",
    "the system consists of a close - in super - earth with orbital period 9.37 days , and two sub - jovian giant planets that orbit at much larger distance from the host star with orbital periods 975 and 2468 days . in order to be dynamically stable",
    "these outer giants need to be in a 5:2 mean motion resonance @xcite .",
    "the corresponding semi - major axes and eccentricities are @xmath166 , @xmath221 and @xmath222 au . of particular interest for our study are the large eccentricities displayed by the system : @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "the value for the short - period super - earth in particular raises interesting questions that we have addressed in this paper : given the large separation between the inner super - earth and outer giants , what are the plausible mechanisms that can lead to excitation of @xmath9 ? given the age of the system ( @xmath207 gyr ) , what are the implications of the observed value of @xmath9 for tidal evolution in the system and the @xmath20-value for the inner body ?",
    "we assume that the hd 181433 planetary system attained its currently observed configuration shortly after dispersal of the protoplanetary disc .",
    "analysis of the secular dynamics indicates that the eccentricity of the inner body can not be explained through present day interactions between it and the outer giants .",

    "we have analysed the tidal evolution and conclude that if the tidal dissipation factor @xmath225 then tidal circularisation should be completed easily within the 6.7 gyr age of the system .",
    "this suggests that hd 181433__b _ _ is not a massive terrestrial - like planet .",
    "a value of @xmath199 leads to very little tidal evolution , implying that the system observed now is similar to its primordial state if this @xmath20-value is appropriate . a value of @xmath226 , characteristic of neptune and uranus @xcite ,",
    "would indicate that the system started out with @xmath73 au and @xmath74 such that the system is essentially half - way through the tidal circularisation process .",
    "this might also indicate that hd 181433__b _ _ should be considered as a hot - neptune rather than a short - period super - earth .",
    "given that all bodies in the system have quite large eccentricities , we began our study by analysing a scenario in which an additional outer giant planet was present originally , leading to global dynamical instability and ejection of this additional body .",
    "this is a natural starting point given the recent work showing that planet - planet scattering can explain the observed eccentricity distribution of the extrasolar planet population @xcite .",
    "the chaotic dynamics involved in such a scenario preclude us from obtaining a close - analogue to the hd 181433 system through n - body simulations , so we restrict our analysis to addressing the following two issues as a means of estimating the likelihood that the scenario may have operated : can the short - period super - earth be perturbed onto an eccentric orbit with the required @xmath227 during the dynamical instability , given that it orbits close to the central star ? ; what is the likelihood of the two outer planets _",
    "c _ and _ d _ landing in the 5:2 resonance after scattering ? from a suite of 300 n - body simulations",
    "we find that @xmath9 reaches @xmath134 in 6% of the runs , and reaches @xmath203 in 2% of them , indicating that we can obtain values of @xmath9 that are appropriate for a range of tidal histories .",
    "further analysis of the width of the 5:2 resonance suggests a probability for landing in resonance of @xmath228 , in good agreement with the more extensive set of n - body simulations of planet - planet scattering reported by @xcite . a naive estimate of the joint probability of eccentricity excitation for planet _ b _ and formation of the 5:2 resonance for planets _",

    "most host stars are rapid rotators ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the semi - major axis of planet _",
    "b _ around hd 181433 is @xmath230 0.08 au , close to a secular resonance . using customised n - body simulations that incorporate precession due to gr and stellar oblateness , and evolution of the stellar spin through magnetic braking",
    ", we have tested the hypothesis that the resonance swept past the location of _ b _ , generating the large eccentricity .",
    "we identify two distinct modes of evolution : for nominal values of the stellar spin - down parameter planet _",
    "b _ is trapped in the resonance temporarily , leading to a maximum growth of eccentricity to @xmath231 ; for values of the stellar spin - down parameter that are marginally smaller than the nominal value ( i.e only 5.75% slower ) , planet _",
    "b _ becomes trapped in the resonance indefinitely with its eccentricity being driven toward unity .",
    "the final fate of the system in this latter case appears to be collision with the central star .",
    "neither of these two outcomes leads to a system that looks like hd 181433__b _ _ , but we find that the inclusion of additional short - period low mass planets in the system , orbiting in the vicinity of planet _",
    "b _ , can perturb it out of long - term resonant capture when its eccentricity has reached large values .",
    "such a scenario can account successfully for the observed orbital properties of planet _",
    "b _ for a range of tidal histories , but in most cases we require a stellar spin period @xmath232 hours for resonant capture to occur . given that we assume the resonant interaction occurs shortly after protoplanetary disc removal , this scenario requires that hd 181433__a _ _ was a member of the young stellar population that displays rotation periods of less than 2 days .",
    "while these stars are in the minority , they are by no means rare @xcite , suggesting that this scenario provides a plausible explanation for the high eccentricity observed for hd 181433__b__.",
