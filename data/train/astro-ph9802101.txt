    "the study of quasars at high redshifts is motivated by a number of interesting , yet unsolved questions : how ( and when ) have quasars formed ?",
    "how do their spectral energy distributions change with time ? what causes the differences between radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars and do these differences persist to high redshifts ?",
    "the x - ray emission of quasars is particularly interesting , since it constitutes a large fraction of the bolometric luminosity of quasars ( e.g. elvis et al .",
    "further , the x - rays are mostly produced in the innermost regions of the agn and can therefore provide clues to our understanding of the central engine and quasar evolution .    in the past ,",

    "@xcite ) , which combine high sensitivity with sufficient spatial and spectral resolution , has enabled the investigation of the x - ray properties of these high redshift objects . however , the number of quasars with @xmath4 , which are detected in x - rays , is still low ( e.g. cappi et al",
    ". 1997 ) . in order to draw statistically significant conclusions on the emission properties of high redshift quasars and possible differences to their local counterparts ,",

    "the basic properties of the observed quasars are summarized in table [ prop ] .",

    "due to its high spatial resolution and the achievable positional accuracy the hri is very well suited to unambiguously identify the x - ray emission of high redshift quasars .",
