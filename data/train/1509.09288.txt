    "since the early 1930 s , galactic rotation curves ( rc s ) and galaxy cluster masses have been known to deviate from newtonian expectations based on luminous matter and known mass - to - luminosity ratios@xcite .",
    "these are two aspects of the dark matter problem@xcite , making this one of the most persistent problems in physics . as a consequence",
    ", many approaches have been brought to bear on the dark matter problem , typically by way of new particles@xcite , but also by way of modifications to existing theories of gravity , e.g. , modified newtonian dynamics ( mond)@xcite and relativistic counterparts@xcite , and moffat s modified gravity ( mog ) , i.e. , metric skew - tensor gravity ( mstg ) and scalar - tensor - vector gravity ( stvg)@xcite .",
    "no one disputes the existence of baryonic dark matter , e.g. , brown dwarfs , black holes , and molecular hydrogen , but there is wide agreement that baryonic dark matter does not exist in large enough supply to resolve the dark matter problem@xcite . while the assumption of non - baryonic dark matter ( dm ) in @xmath0cdm cosmology models works well for explaining cosmological features ( scales greater than 1 mpc ) ,",
    "there is still no independent verification of non - baryonic dark matter and galactic rc s do not conform to the theoretical predictions of @xmath0cdm for the distribution of dm on gravitational scales@xcite .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable at this stage to consider modifications to existing theories of gravity that deny the need for dm in resolving the dark matter problem .",
    "accordingly , we explain galactic rc s and the mass profiles of x - ray clusters without dm based on our foundations - driven approach to fundamental physics called relational blockworld ( rbw ) .",
    "we extend this reasoning to cosmological scales , but an rbw fit of anisotropies in the angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) due to acoustic oscillations remains to be done .",
    "rbw was originally conceived as an interpretation of quantum mechanics@xcite , but it quickly became apparent that it has implications for quantum gravity , unification and astrophysics@xcite . according to rbw , reality is fundamentally discrete , so although the lattice geometry of regge calculus@xcite is typically viewed as an approximation to the continuous spacetime manifold of general relativity ( gr ) , it could be that discrete spacetime is fundamental while `` the usual continuum theory is very likely only an approximation@xcite '' and that is what we assume ( section [ sec2 ] ) .",
    "further , the links of a regge calculus graph can connect non - neighboring points of the gr spacetime manifold leading to small corrections to the corresponding gr spacetime geometry .",
    "the direct connection between non - neighboring points on the spacetime manifold is referred to as `` disordered locality''@xcite and has been used on astrophysical scales to explain dark energy@xcite .",
    "our views deviate from the standard use of regge calculus , so we refer to our approach as modified regge calculus ( morc ) .",
    "we used morc to generate a fit of the union2 compilation supernova data matching that of @xmath0cdm via a simple perturbative geometric correction of proper distance in einstein - desitter ( eds ) cosmology@xcite .",
    "the resulting explanation did not harbor accelerating expansion , so there was no need of a cosmological constant or dark energy . similarly here , we use morc without dm to fit galactic rc s rivaling mond ( section [ sec3 ] ) by assuming disordered locality as well as `` contextuality , '' i.e. , matter can simultaneously have two different values of mass . in this case",
    ", the mass of matter interior to the schwarzschild solution ( proper mass ) can differ from the mass of that same matter in the surrounding schwarzschild metric ( dynamic mass ) .",
    "we then use this same approach to fit the mass profiles of x - ray clusters rivaling mstg ( section [ sec4 ] ) .",
    "we argue that such modifications are perturbative ( small ) in the context of the gr spacetime geometry . while we argue that the idea can be extended to dark matter phenomena on cosmological scales",
    ", we do not undertake a fit of the cmb angular power spectrum here .",
    "essentially , we claim that large discrepancies observed between proper mass and dynamic mass on galactic and galactic cluster scales in the context of gr spacetime can be understood as resulting from small corrections to the gr spacetime geometry .",
    "we therefore conclude ( section [ sec5 ] ) that morc s contextuality and disordered locality may resolve the dark matter problem on galactic and galactic cluster scales without non - baryonic dark matter , as do mond and mstg , respectively .",
    "since the morc approach to the dark matter problem can be extended to cosmology and has already been used to explain away dark energy , dark matter and dark energy phenomena may simply reflect geometric perturbations to idealized spacetime structure on large scales .",
    "regge calculus is typically viewed as a discrete approximation to gr where the discrete counterpart to einstein s equations is obtained from the least action principal on a 4d graph .",
    "this generates a rule for constructing a discrete approximation to the spacetime manifold of gr using small , contiguous 4d minkowskian graphical ` tetrahedra ' called `` simplices . ''",
    "the smaller the legs of the simplices , the better one may approximate a differentiable manifold via a lattice spacetime ( figure [ regge1 ] ) .",
    "curvature in regge calculus is represented by `` deficit angles '' ( figure [ regge2 ] ) about any plane orthogonal to a `` hinge '' ( triangular / polygon side of a tetrahedron/3d volume , which is a side of a 4d simplex ) , so curvature is said to reside on the hinges .",
    "a hinge is two dimensions less than the lattice dimension , so in 2d a hinge is a zero - dimensional point ( figure [ regge2 ] ) .",
    "the hilbert action for a vacuum lattice is ( geometrized units)@xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a triangular hinge in the lattice _",
    "l _ , @xmath3 is the area of @xmath2 and @xmath4 is the deficit angle associated with @xmath2 .",
    "the counterpart to einstein s equations is then obtained by demanding @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the squared length of the @xmath7 lattice edge , i.e. , the metric . to obtain equations in the presence of matter - energy , one simply adds the matter - energy action @xmath8 to @xmath9 and carries out the variation as before to obtain @xmath10 the lhs of eq([eq2 ] )",
    "becomes @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the angle opposite edge @xmath13 in hinge @xmath2 .",
    "one finds the stress - energy tensor is associated with lattice edges , just as the metric , and regge s equations are to be satisfied for any particular choice of the two tensors on the lattice .",
    "the modification to regge calculus we propose is to add links between non - neighboring points in the context of the corresponding continuous spacetime manifold , i.e. , disordered locality .",
    "then , one would solve regge s equations for the lattice as before ( modified per disordered locality ) , except that now there is an additional complication in that the lhs of eq([eq2 ] ) no longer has the simple analytic form given by eq([eq3 ] ) .",
    "indeed , without some highly symmetric form of disordered locality , we would not expect a counterpart to eq([eq3 ] ) and the modified regge s equations would have to be solved numerically .",
    "thus , we assume the existence of modest disordered locality in the exact regge calculus graph justifies small corrections to the corresponding approximate gr solution ( which assumes only local interactions per the hausdorff topology of the gr differentiable manifold ) .",
    "we should note here that an `` exact regge calculus graph '' would contain a link for every quantum exchange .",
    "certainly no such solution could ever be generated , so in practice we imagine modified regge calculus graphs with greatly simplifying assumptions would be used as approximations of the exact regge calculus graph ( also true of standard regge calculus , obviously )",
    ". when all link lengths are small , i.e. , in the absence of disordered locality , these approximate regge calculus solutions would then correspond to gr solutions , i.e. , we have standard regge calculus@xcite . as with gr solutions ,",
    "regge calculus solutions are difficult to obtain and there is no reason to believe that finding extrema of a regge graphical action modified per disordered locality would be any easier .",
    "rather , at this point , we are simply operating on the assumption that a modified regge graphical action and its extrema will make correspondence with regge calculus and gr in the proper limits .",
    "motivated by rbw s prediction of disordered locality with its violation of the hausdorff nature of gr s spacetime manifold , we are systematically exploring possible geometric corrections to astrophysical phenomena that may be examples of disordered locality .",
    "it seems to us that dark energy and dark matter are two such examples . if we can find simple perturbative geometric corrections that resolve the problems of dark energy and dark matter , then we will use these as guides to the construction of a simplified cosmological regge graphical action modified per disordered locality . in the case of dark energy as pertains to the union2 compilation supernova data , we speculated on a perturbative geometric correction to proper distance in eds cosmology . here ,",
    "we explore possible perturbative geometric corrections to resolve the dark matter problem as pertains to galactic rc s and mass profiles of x - ray clusters , and we argue that this approach can be extended to cosmology . given we do not yet have a graphical action for morc , it is not as well - developed as mond and mstg .",
    "rather , at this stage , the fits we present constitute a feasibility study .",
    "we begin with morc s approach to galactic rc s , which is then easily extended to galactic clusters .",
    "since galactic rc s are expected to follow newtonian predictions to the technical limits of current astronomical observations , the metric is simply that of newtonian spacetime , i.e. , we will talk unambiguously about spatial hypersurfaces and consider newtonian potentials as small perturbations to the background gr spacetime structure . in the case of galactic rc s and galactic clusters , the gr background spacetime is flat .",
    "for cosmology , the gr background spacetime is friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) .",
    "our use of gr spacetime with perturbing newtonian potentials is called the `` newtonian gauge''@xcite .",
    "although `` the kerr metric does not represent the exterior metric of a physically likely source , nor the metric during any realistic gravitational collapse''@xcite , we might nonetheless consider it structurally since rotating galaxies are prima facie axisymmetric . in",
    "boyer - linquist coordinates , the kerr metric is ( geometrized units ) @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "this reduces to the schwarzschild metric @xmath17 when @xmath18 ( @xmath19 is the angular momentum per unit mass ) . if for a given galactic orbital radius @xmath20 we assume all the mass @xmath21 interior to that radius resides in a radially and axially thin , disk - shaped annulus at @xmath20 with orbital velocity @xmath22 in order to generate the most conservative ( largest ) estimate of @xmath23 , we have @xmath24 ( restoring @xmath25 ) . since , the largest galactic orbital velocities are about 300 km / s , we have @xmath26 so we will use the much simpler schwarzschild metric for our discussions .",
    "such approximations are not unusual in astrophysics , since it is the case that `` for realistic distributions of matter in galaxies , we have neither analytic , nor numerical solutions to general relativity from which orbits can be predicted''@xcite .    the metric modification we propose has to do with `` contextuality , '' i.e. , matter can have different values of mass in different contexts , e.g. , the mass of a free neutron is greater than the mass of a neutron in a nucleus .",
    "as regards the mass of baryonic matter in galaxies , the same baryonic matter can have two different values of mass at the same time by virtue of its simultaneous existence in two different contexts .",
    "for example , when a schwarzschild vacuum surrounds a spherical matter distribution the proper mass @xmath27 of the matter ( the mass measured locally in the matter ) can be different than the dynamical mass @xmath21 in the schwarzschild metric responsible for orbital kinematics about the matter@xcite .",
    "we apply that idea here to each `` infinitesimal '' annulus of matter in orbit around the galactic center .",
    "the mass of that annulus of matter as measured by mass - to - luminosity ratios is its proper mass @xmath28 while the dynamical mass it contributes to orbiting annuli at larger orbital radii @xmath29 differs from @xmath28 .",
    "for example , suppose a schwarzschild vacuum surrounds a sphere of frw dust connected at the instanteously null schwarzschild radial coordinate .",
    "the dynamic mass @xmath21 of the surrounding schwarzschild metric is related to the proper mass @xmath27 of the frw dust by@xcite @xmath30 that @xmath31 for the spatially flat frw dust ( eds cosmology ) follows in part from the fact that the spatial curvature scalar equals zero @xmath32 for the schwarzschild metric .    of course , in the gr sense , we re not local to the stars and gas orbiting the center of a distant galaxy . however , our measurements of mass - to - luminosity ratios ( m / l ) are based on local measurements , e.g. , objects in close orbits to stars .",
    "thus , when we infer a mass based on m / l , our measurements are de facto local to that matter , so we are measuring @xmath28 for each annulus via its luminosity even though the galaxy is millions of parsecs away .",
    "[ this is motivated by rbw s version of direct particle interaction , which in its original form would require a modification to general relativistic astrophysics in and of itself @xcite . ]",
    "the morc graph then has the mass @xmath33 associated with the links between a given orbiting annulus of matter and earth while the mass associated with the link(s ) connecting the orbital annulus of matter to stellar matter orbiting at larger radii is @xmath29 which can differ from @xmath28 .",
    "if , for example , the annulus of orbiting matter had a mass other than @xmath28 for the links connecting it to earth , we would see the atomic spectra change accordingly .",
    "we do not attribute changes in the atomic spectra of atoms from distant galaxies to such changes in mass , so we tacitly assume that the matter has mass @xmath28 in the context of its direct interaction with us .",
    "viewed graphically , matter might be thought of as residing on nodes while the mass of that matter would reside on links , as we stated supra concerning the stress - energy tensor in regge calculus .",
    "different links associated with one and the same node could have different values of mass .",
    "the result of this view is that mass is a characterization of spacetime geometry , itself a system of relations , it s not an intrinsic property of matter .",
    "accordingly , small differences in spacetime geometry can be characterized by relatively large differences in the values of mass .",
    "for example , while @xmath21 can be @xmath34 , the deviation from flat spacetime on typical galactic scales per @xmath35 is negligible given current technical limits on astronomical observations . assuming circular orbits ( which is common for fitting galactic rc s ) we have @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the dynamic mass inside the circular orbit at radius @xmath20 and @xmath22 is the orbital speed .",
    "this gives @xmath38 .",
    "again , the largest galactic rotation speeds are typically only @xmath39 so the metric deviation from flat spacetime is @xmath40 and @xmath41 constitutes an empirically small metric correction .",
    "another way to quantify the difference geometrically between @xmath21 and @xmath27 is to use @xmath42 @xcite on galactic scales ( where @xmath43 is the mass density ) .",
    "assuming constant mass density ( typical in a galactic bulge ) out to radius @xmath20 where we have orbital velocity @xmath22 , we have @xmath44 .",
    "constant density means @xmath45",
    "so @xmath46 increases linearly with distance from zero to its max value @xmath47 . assuming this happens at the radius of the bulge @xmath48 ( galactic rc s",
    "actually peak farther out , so this overestimates the effect ) , we have @xmath49 for the spatial curvature scalar in the annulus at @xmath20 rather than its schwarzschild value of zero .",
    "@xmath50 and @xmath51 gives @xmath52 .",
    "so , a factor of ten one way or the other in @xmath43 is geometrically inconsequential in this context . another way to state this , in terms of modified regge calculus ,",
    "is that the variation in the deficit angles that accounts for the variation of @xmath43 we re proposing on galactic scales is miniscule .",
    "for all these reasons , we believe it s not unreasonable to speculate on a morc perturbative correction to gr spacetime geometry that changes the mass @xmath28 in order to fit galactic rc s without non - baryonic dark matter .    in the mond approach with",
    "spherical symmetry and circular orbits , as is commonly used for fitting galactic rc s , it is the newtonian acceleration @xmath53 that is modified by the so - called interpolating function @xmath54 where @xmath55 with @xmath56 a universal constant so that @xmath57 @xmath58 for @xmath59 and @xmath60 for @xmath61 .",
    "of course , @xmath62 means one could view eq([eq9 ] ) as a modification to @xmath37 or @xmath63 as in mstg @xcite @xmath64 where @xmath65 in mstg . in terms of the newtonian potential @xmath66 ,",
    "the schwarzschild metric is @xmath67 where @xmath68 .",
    "so , in that sense , morc , mond and mstg can all be viewed as mog @xcite .",
    "therefore , the morc and mond fits for things data in section [ sec3 ] need not be viewed as evidence for any particular theoretical justification .",
    "applications beyond astrophysics and cosmology will ultimately adjudicate between competing theoretical justifications . here , we seek only to test morc s approach to fitting galactic rc s by comparing it to mond using data where mond fits were deemed `` very successful''@xcite .    in the mond fits of section [ sec3 ] , we will use the so - called `` simple '' @xmath69 function @xmath70 which gentile et al . found most successful with the things data@xcite .",
    "we will also adopt their median best - fit value of the acceleration parameter for the simple @xmath69 function , @xmath71 x @xmath72 cm s@xmath73 .",
    "generally speaking , mond has a single fit parameter , @xmath74 for the stellar disk , although when bulge data is available independent of the stellar disk , an additional @xmath74 factor can be introduced for the bulge as well .",
    "we will also allow galactic distance @xmath75 to vary up to one sigma from the nominal value in our mond fits .",
    "gentile et al .",
    "called this `` @xmath75 constrained''@xcite . finally , gentile et al . also note",
    "this data is `` not obviously dominated by non - circular motions , ''",
    "so we assume circular orbits to obtain the mond @xmath22 as related to the newtonian @xmath76 @xcite @xmath77 where @xmath78 allowing for variation in m / l for the stellar disk and bulge means @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are fit parameters .",
    "assuming the distance d to the galaxy can vary means a further correction in m / l ( fitting parameter ) for all components , call it @xmath82 , giving @xmath83 where @xmath84 in eq([eq13 ] ) as well .",
    "eq([eq13 ] ) is then used to fit things data , i.e. , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 , using the fit parameters @xmath80 , @xmath89 , and @xmath82 .",
    "morc computes the baryonic proper mass @xmath90 for each component @xmath91 using eq([eq7 ] ) with @xmath92 supplied by things .",
    "then @xmath93 for the proper mass of the @xmath94 component in an annulus .",
    "a geometric modification is applied to each @xmath95 according to its radial location to obtain the corresponding dynamic mass @xmath96 @xmath97 where @xmath98 is a fitting factor for the @xmath94 component and @xmath99 is a fitting parameter that is the same for all components .",
    "ultimately , we expect @xmath98 and @xmath99 to be determined from the morc graphical action .",
    "thus , as we stated supra , the fitting procedures needed to resolve the problems of dark energy and dark matter should give us a hint as to the graphical action for morc cosmology .",
    "the @xmath96 are summed to produce @xmath100 , which are then summed to produce @xmath37 which gives @xmath85 per eq([eq7 ] ) .    for fitting the mass profiles of x - ray clusters",
    ", one assumes a spherically symmetric , isothermal distribution of x - ray emitting gas in hydrostatic equilibrium with the gravitational potential@xcite .",
    "the gas mass profile as determined by the x - ray luminosity is given by @xmath101 where @xmath102 the constants @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 are found from fits of the surface density map @xmath106 .",
    "@xmath107 corresponds to the `` proper mass '' for galactic rc s above .",
    "the dynamic mass profile needed for hydrostatic equilibrium at temperature @xmath108 is given by @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the mean atomic weight of the gas constituents ( @xmath111 ) ,",
    "@xmath112 is the mass of the proton , @xmath113 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath63 is the gravitational constant . in the msgt version of mog per moffat and brownstein , as stated above , @xmath114 and is understood to reduce @xmath37 of eq([eq20 ] ) to @xmath107 of eq([eq18 ] ) .",
    "effectively , we have @xmath115 where @xmath116 with @xmath117 and @xmath118 fitting parameters and @xmath37 computed using @xmath63 in eq([eq20 ] ) .",
    "since we re assuming spherical symmetry , the morc approach used for galactic rc s can be easily adopted here .",
    "contrary to mstg , in morc we are increasing @xmath119 by a geometric factor to give the dynamic mass @xmath37 .",
    "thus , we modify eq([eq18 ] ) to give @xmath120 with @xmath121 given by eq([eq19 ] ) and @xmath122 and @xmath99 fitting parameters in analogy to the morc fits of galactic rc s .",
    "this value of @xmath37 is then compared to that of eq([eq20 ] ) .",
    "we are now ready to compare morc fits with mond fits of twelve high - resolution galactic rc s from the hi nearby galaxy survey@xcite used by gentile et al.@xcite to explore mond fits .",
    "gentile et al .",
    "describe these data as `` the most reliable for mass modelling , and they are the highest quality rc s currently available for a sample of galaxies spanning a wide range of luminosities . ''",
    "keep in mind that mond fits are more rigorously constrained , since mond is a highly developed theory .",
    "morc fits on the other hand are being done to determine feasibility and guidance in constructing a graphical action for morc cosmology .",
    "this is akin to allowing the acceleration parameter @xmath56 to vary in mond fits so as to determine its value as a universal constant .",
    "morc results are in table [ morcrc ] and mond results are in table [ mondrc ]",
    ". graphical display of the best fits reported below are in figures [ galaxy1 ] & [ galaxy2 ] .",
    "what we note concerning @xmath99 is its broad range , @xmath123 .",
    "we will find that this range is greatly reduced for x - ray clusters .",
    "we used a simple mean square error ( mse or mean @xmath124 ) to quantify the fits ."
