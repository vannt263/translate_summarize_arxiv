    "protecting quantum information from the affects of decoherence , unwanted interactions between the system and its environment , is a vital requirement of any hoped for quantum computer implementation @xcite .",
    "such protection can be achieved via active or passive techniques .",
    "active techniques , quantum error correction , identify and correct errors that may have affected the quantum information . alternatively , passive techniques store the quantum information in such a way that it is _ a priori _ immune to error . two general schemes which allow for the passive avoidance of quantum errors",
    "are decoherence free subspaces ( dfs ) and noiseless subsystems ( ns ) . dfss store quantum information in specific states with an inherent symmetry such that the information is then immune to decoherence generators that respect those symmetries @xcite .",
    "nss store quantum information in certain symmetries of other degrees of freedom of the system @xcite which are not the states themselves .",
    "the error avoidance properties of dfss and nss makes them especially well suited for the construction of quantum memories since the system storing the information can , ideally , never be addressed until the information is needed .",
    "however , manifestations of both schemes may utilize states that are highly entangled and thus may be subject to entanglement sudden death ( esd ) .",
    "entanglement is a uniquely quantum mechanical phenomenon in which quantum systems exhibit correlations not possible for classical systems @xcite .",
    "decoherence may be especially detrimental to highly entangled states @xcite such as those used for protecting quantum information .",
    "an extreme negative manifestation of this is esd in which entanglement is completely lost in finite time @xcite despite the fact that the coherence loss of the system is asymptotic .",
    "recently @xcite , there has been a call to develop techniques to counteract esd so as to protect quantum memory from its harmful consequences .    in this paper",
    "i explore the affect of esd on entangled states that are specifically examples of dfss and nss .",
    "my goal is to explore whether esd is really a threat to quantum memories built from error aviodance schemes above and beyond that of typical decoherence .",
    "the direct study of the affect of esd on quantum protocols has only been undertaken recently . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that a three ( physical ) qubit error correction code capable of protecting a qubit of quantum information from phase flips is indifferent to the phenomenon of esd .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that in cluster states capable of primitive quantum gates via cluster state ( or one - way ) quantum computing protocols , correlations exist between esd and the point at which the fidelity of the decohered state equals .5 . in this paper",
    "such explorations are extended to the affect of esd on error avoidance protocols .",
    "other related work addressing esd of multi - particle systems can be found in @xcite and there have been several initial experimental studies of this phenomenon @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above when constructing a quantum memory it would be most practical to store the information and not have to address the memory again until the information is needed .",
    "this can be achieved using error avoidance techniques .",
    "in addition , it is reasonable to assume that in a quantum memory the dominant decoherence generators would be far field , such that they affect all of the qubits collectively .",
    "thus , we begin by studying a four - qubit dfs and a three - qubit ns that protect quantum information from collective decoherence . however , it is most likely that some additional decoherence that is not collective , but rather qubit independent , will affect the system .",
    "this decoherence will degrade the stored quantum information and , if strong enough may cause esd .",
    "we will explore the relationship between the decoherence strength at which esd is exhibited due to this decoherence and the fidelity of the stored qubit of quantum information .",
    "the decoherence models we explore are the independent qubit dephasing and depolarizing environments .",
    "the dephasing environment is fully described by the kraus operators @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the dephasing strength .",
    "when all @xmath2 qubits undergo dephasing we have @xmath3 kraus operators each of the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the depolarizing environment is described by kraus operators @xmath7 where @xmath8 are the pauli spin matrices and now @xmath1 is the depolarizing strength . for the depolarizing environment",
    "there are @xmath9 kraus operators .",
    "though all of the below calculations are done with respect to @xmath1 , i implicitly assume that @xmath1 increases with time , @xmath10 , at a rate @xmath11 , such that @xmath12 and @xmath13 only at infinite times .",
    "i also assume equal decoherence strength on all qubits ( this can be viewed as the worst - case scenario ) .    to monitor the occurrence of esd",
    "i will utilize a number of entanglement metrics .",
    "the first is the negativity , @xmath14 , for which i will simply use the ( absolute value of the ) most negative eigenvalue of the parital transpose of the system density matrix @xcite .",
    "when there are more than two qubits in the system the partial transpose can be taken with respect to different sets of qubits @xmath15 giving , in general , inequivalent negativities .",
    "i will also make use of the two qubit concurrence @xcite , @xmath16 .",
    "the concurrence between two qubits @xmath17 and @xmath18 with density matrix @xmath19 is usually defined as the maximum of zero and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and the @xmath22 are the eigenvalues of @xmath23 in decreasing order and @xmath24 is the @xmath25 pauli matrix of qubit @xmath15 . for the purposes of clearly seeing at what point esd occurs we will use @xmath20 as the concurrence noting that esd occurs when @xmath26 in finite time ( i.  e.  before @xmath27 ) . to measure entanglement between general states of three qubits",
    "i will use the tri - partite negativity @xcite , @xmath28 , which is simply the third root of the product of the negativities with respect to each of the three qubits @xmath29{n^{(1)}n^{(2)}n^{(3)}}$ ] .",
    "the smallest possible dfs that can protect one qubit of quantum information from the affects of collective decoherence is comprised of four physical qubits @xcite .",
    "the two ( orthogonal ) basis states for this dfs are @xcite : @xmath30 i assume an initial state of @xmath31 .",
    "any such state will not evolve under collective decoherence but is degraded by independent ( physical ) qubit decoherence . to determine the affect of esd on the storage of quantum information in this dfs we compare the decoherence strength at which esd is exhibited for different entanglement measures to the fidelity of the degraded state .    in an independent dephasing environment",
    "the fidelity of the four qubit system in any state @xmath32 is given by : @xmath33 yet , despite the fact that the fidelity of the state of the system can be degraded below .5 , the system negativity does not exhibit esd .",
    "thus , unlike @xcite , esd is not an indicator that the fidelity of the stored information falls below .5 .",
    "the independent qubit dephsing environment does cause esd for the entanglement between any two of the qubits in the system as measured by the concurrence . for the evolution of concurrence between the first qubit and each of the other qubits , @xmath34 , esd is exhibited at different points based on the initial state as shown in fig .",
    "[ dephase ] .",
    "if concurrence in the dephasing environment does exhibit esd while the negativity does not we may ask what type of entanglement is present after the concurrence goes to zero . to answer this",
    "we can look at the tri - partite negativity , @xmath28 , after tracing over one of the four qubits . in an independent dephasing environment none of the tri - partite negativities exhibit esd .",
    "thus , the remaining entanglement after the sudden disappearance of the concurrence between two qubits is , at least , the tri - partite entanglement measured by the tri - partite negativity .    fig .  [ dephase ] displays the evolution of the various entanglement metrics as a function of the intial state and decoherence strength and allows us to compare the onset ( or not ) of esd to the evolution of the fidelity .",
    "there is no discontinuity or change of behavior that occurs in the fidelity evolution at the point where esd sets in .",
    "in fact , there is not even a clear correlation between the entanglement evolution and that of the fidelity .",

    "it is always necessary to protect quantum information from the possibly debilitating affects of decoherence .",
    "esd may be caused by certain decoherence generators but protection of quantum information from the esd phenomenon does not require any special attention .",
