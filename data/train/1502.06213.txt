    "heavy - ion collisions at ultra - relativistic energies generates the creation of a new state of matter with a temperature @xmath9 significantly above the cross - over temperature @xmath10 expected for the transition of hadronic matter to the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite . in the last decade a consensus seems to have emerged that quarks and gluons are indeed deconfined for a short amount of time in the fireball created , and that this quark gluon plasma behaves like a very good liquid with small viscosity over entropy density ratio @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "one of the most surprising observations at rhic @xcite have been the strong enhancement of the baryon over meson ratio in a wide range of @xmath12 and a significantly larger ( about @xmath13 ) elliptic flow @xmath14 of baryons with respect to that of mesons @xcite , at variance with expectation from both hydrodynamics and jet - quenching fragmentation .",
    "however soon after these first data it was realized that an hadronization process through quark coalescence can naturally explain both features of hadron spectra appearing in the same @xmath0 region @xcite .",
    "the idea of quark coalescence as hadronization from a qgp where the quark ( anti - quark ) needed to hadronize are already present and there is no need to create them from vacuum , was initially suggested in ref.s @xcite with the approach known as alcor model .",
    "however , there the main focus was on particle yields and ratios and not the different kinematics between baryons and mesons that explains their pattern for @xmath0 spectra and elliptic flow .",
    "after the first papers applying the coalescence mechanism for hadron production at rhic @xcite there have been mainly two further studies.in one case the coalescence approach has been extended to include finite width that accounts for off - shell effect which allows to include the constraint of energy conservation @xcite .",
    "this is seen not to change the general feature of the coalescence mechanism , the baryon / meson enhancement and approximate quark number scaling of @xmath14 , but shows that at low @xmath0 , when energy conservation plays a stronger role , a scaling with @xmath15 is favored , at least for direct hadron production .",
    "more recently , an approach that from one hand enforce algebraically the unitarity similarly to alcor approach , but for the momentum distribution use essentially the prescription of ref.s @xcite has been developed in @xcite . the price paid to have both aspects is the need to add a global constant in the coalescence probability in such a way that all the quarks recombine and moreover the quark distribution functions are fitted by mean of six parameters to describe hadron spectra .",
    "nonetheless the result are similar to @xcite except a better description of the low @xmath0 region , where however the present coalescence scheme can be anyway questionable and the success of the description of the spectra down to low @xmath0 may simply come from the large flexibility of the fitted parton distribution .    in this paper , we employ the coalescence approach developed in @xcite that is based on the same basic idea of phase - space quark coalescence as in @xcite but being solved by a monte carlo approach allows to include a 3d geometry as well as radial flow correlation in the partonic spectra and the effect of the main resonance decays .",
    "the last is mainly discussed in @xcite and allows to have a reasonable description of the spectra also at low momenta that are usually dominated by feed - down from resonance decays .",
    "however the model does not implement a unitarity conservation that guarantees hadronization of the full bulk of particles , also energy conservation and the finite width ( off - shell ) effect are not included as in @xcite which at low momentum play a role . therefore the model has to be considered really applicable only at @xmath16 , even if the description of the spectra or baryon / meson ratios remains approximately good also at lower @xmath0 , especially for pions that are dominated by decay feed - down at low @xmath0 .",
    "in fact the present dynamical formulation of the coalescence used remains fully meaningful when the single process of hadronization is small and hence it is not justified where the bulk of the particles resides .",
    "we report in this paper the results applying the original model of coalescence plus fragmentation in @xcite at both lhc pb+pb @xmath17 and rhic au+au @xmath18 energies .",
    "this last case was partially present also in @xcite , but some more resonance decays have been added , the update albino - kniehl - kramer ( akk ) fragmentation function and also the @xmath5 momentum spectra have been evaluated .",
    "furthermore the availability of experimental data allows for a comparison in a wider @xmath0 range .",
    "we see that the same model is able to correctly predict the spectra of the main hadrons ( @xmath19 ) , and correctly account for the evolution of such spectra from rhic to lhc energy and in particular the @xmath0 dependence of the @xmath20 ratios .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we describe the general formalism of a covariant coalescence model for mesons and baryons and how it is numerically solved by means of a monte carlo method . how mini - jets and the quark - gluon plasma partons are determined is described in sec .",
    "results for the transverse momentum hadronic spectra obtained from the coalescence model are given in sec .",
    "iv for rhic energy and in sec .",
    "v for lhc energy .",
    "finally , we conclude in sec .",
    "vi with a summary of present work and an outlook about future developments and applications of the parton coalescence model .",
    "the hadronization mechanism is well known to belong to the non - perturbative domain of the qcd dynamics and certainly a first - principle description of hadron formation has yet to be obtained .",
    "one of the most common approach dealing with hadronization , routinely used in nuclear and particle physics for inclusive hadron production , is the independent fragmentation in which a single colored parton @xmath21 has to hadronize into the hadron @xmath22 . for this purpose , fragmentation or parton decay functions",
    "@xmath23 have been defined and give the probability of finding hadron @xmath24 in parton @xmath25 with a momentum fraction @xmath26 , @xmath27 . the cross section for inclusive hadron production",
    "can then be written as @xmath28 which is a convolution of the production cross section @xmath29 for parton @xmath30 with the fragmentation function @xmath31 .",
    "fragmentation functions are not reliably calculable from first principles in qcd .",
    "however , they are observables and can be measured experimentally .    physically , the fragmentation of a single parton happens through the creation of @xmath32 pairs , which subsequently arrange into color singlets forming hadrons .",
    "such a scheme is based on the concept of qcd factorization , which separates the long- from the short - distance dynamics .",
    "notice that in a bulk qgp matter created in heavy - ion collisions the hadronization can occur on average at a time scale @xmath33 ( depending on its initial temperature ) this means that the partons do not need a creation of @xmath34 at the moment of hadronization , but they can rescatter and generate a thermal medium expanding with a radial collective flow . at @xmath35 partons have a certain abundance in phase space such that there is no need for the creation of additional partons through splitting or string breaking .",
    "the most naive expectation for such a scenario is a simple recombination of the deconfined partons into hadrons .",
    "indeed , there is experimental evidence that this is the correct description of hadronization , even long before a thermal occupation of parton phase space is reached @xcite .",
    "the approaches developed in @xcite for the coalescence is based on the wigner formalism originally developed for nucleons @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of hadrons formed from the coalescence of quarks can be written as : @xmath36    where @xmath37 denotes an element of a space - like hypersurface , @xmath38 is the statistical factor to form a colorless hadron from quark and antiquark with spin 1/2 .",
    "@xmath39 are the quark ( anti - quark ) distribution in phase space .",
    "@xmath40 is the wigner function and describes the spatial and momentum distribution of quarks in a hadron .",
    "[ eq - coal ] for @xmath41 describes meson formation , and for @xmath42 the baryon one .",
    "the above formula can also be used for antibaryons by replacing quark momentum spectra by the momentum spectra of antiquarks    the statistical factor @xmath43 takes into account the internal quantum numbers in forming a colorless meson from spin-1/2 colored quark and antiquark . for mesons considered here , i.e. , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 , the statistical factors are @xmath46 and @xmath47 . for baryons and antibaryons considered in present study , i.e. @xmath48 and @xmath49 ,",
    "the statistical factors are @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the coalescence probability function @xmath52 ( @xmath53)depends in principle on the overlap of the quark and anti - quark distribution functions with the wave function of the meson ( baryon ) as well as the interactions of emitted virtual partons , which are needed for balancing the energy and momentum , with the partonic matter . neglecting the off - shell effects the coalescence probability function is then simply the covariant hadron wigner distribution function .    in the greco - ko - levai ( gkl ) in ref.@xcite approach for a meson",
    "the wigner function is a sphere of radius @xmath54 in coordinate space and @xmath55 in momentum space , these two parameters are related by the uncertainty principle @xmath56 , @xmath57 where we have defined the quadri - vectors for the relative coordinates @xmath58 , @xmath59 and the scalar @xmath60 . for a baryon",
    "we have a similar wigner function expressed in term of appropriate relative coordinates : @xmath61 and we have defined @xmath62 and @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "we note that the wigner function for the meson has only one parameter @xmath65 that we choose to have a mean square radius of mesons of about 0.8 fm which corresponds to a @xmath66 . for baryons",
    "we have also one parameter , even if one could consider two different @xmath67 for the two relative coordinates , for @xmath68 baryons we have a @xmath69 and for @xmath70 baryons @xmath71 which corresponds to a slighter smaller radius for @xmath5 as one can expect from the wave function of an harmonic oscillator that scales with the inverse square root of the reduced mass of the system .",
    "however we have checked that small variation of @xmath72 does not strongly affect the slope of the spectra coming from coalescence .",
    "a specific feature of the gkl approach has been the inclusion of resonance decays to the pion , proton , @xmath73 spectra .",
    "this was a way to include a minimal effect that certainly is present in the final spectra observed . in this paper",
    "we have also included some more resonance with respect to the original work @xcite this however does not change significantly the results for the @xmath0 spectra especially at @xmath74 .",
    "this can be envisaged because the resonance decay products mainly feed - down the low @xmath0 region .",
    "the residual effect at intermediate @xmath0 can be reabsorbed by a rescaling of the wigner function hadron parameter @xmath72 by about a @xmath75 . for the resonances",
    "the coalescence probability is augmented with a suppression factor that takes into account for the boltzmann probability to populate an excited state of energy @xmath76 at a temperature t , namely accordingly to the statistical model factor @xmath77 , with @xmath78 and @xmath79 and @xmath80 the mass of the resonance ; of course also the degeneracy factors that come from the different values of isospin and total angular momentum are taken in account .      in ref.@xcite it has been clarified that at increasing @xmath0 the probability to coalescence decreases and eventually the standard independent fragmentation takes over .",
    "it is therefore necessary to include also the contribution from the mini - jet fragmentation .",
    "this is done by employing the same parton distribution function that at high @xmath81 are those that can be calculated in next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in a pqcd scheme .",
    "however in aa collisions one must include also the modification due to the jet quenching mechanism @xcite .",
    "the hadron momentum spectra from the minijet parton spectra is given by : @xmath82    where @xmath83 is the fraction of minijet momentum carried by the hadron and @xmath84 is the momentum scale for the fragmentation process .",
    "for @xmath85 we employ the akk fragmentation function @xcite .",
    "the fragmentation is applied for partons at @xmath86 .",
    "it is also worth to mention that the inclusion of both coalescence and fragmentation does not lead to a double counting of hadron formed because a hadron at @xmath87 from coalescence comes from partons at @xmath88 with @xmath89 , while from fragmentation the parton creating it comes from a @xmath90 .",
    "therefore , for example considering the fragmentation for a hadron at @xmath91 the quark that creates it has on average a @xmath92 but the probability of coalescence for such a parton is very small and it would produce hadrons in a very different region of @xmath93 where the coalescence is certainly negligible .    as in @xcite the multi - dimensional integrals in the coalescence formula as well as the fragmentation are evaluated by the monte - carlo method via test particles . specifically , we introduce a large number of test partons with uniform momentum distribution in phase - space . to take into account the large difference between numbers of thermal and minijet partons , a test parton with momentum @xmath94",
    "is given a probability that is proportional to the parton momentum distribution , e.g. , @xmath95 , with the proportional constant determined by requiring that the sum of all parton probabilities is equal to the parton number .",
    "with test partons , the coalescence formulas , for mesons and baryons can be re - written as @xmath96 and @xmath97 in the above , @xmath98 and @xmath99 are probabilities carried by @xmath100th test quark and @xmath101th test antiquark .",
    "the monte - carlo method allows us to treat the coalescence of low momentum partons on the same footing as that of high momentum ones .",
    "the coalescence approach as developed till now to describe hadron production in urhic s is based on a fireball where the bulk of particles is a thermalized system of gluons and @xmath102 quarks and anti - quarks at the temperature @xmath103 @xcite which is about the temperature for the cross - over transition in realistic lattice qcd calculation @xcite . at high momenta , @xmath104 ,",
    "the distribution is taken to be the partonic spectra that undergone the in - medium jet quenching @xcite .",
    "the longitudinal momentum distribution is assumed to be boost - invariant , i.e. , a uniform rapidity distribution in the range @xmath105 . while these features are common to both rhic and lhc , with the beam energy there is a change in the radial flow and self - consistently in the volume of the bulk of the qgp , as well as at high @xmath0",
    "there is a different initial distribution and jet quenching .    in this paper , we consider au+au at @xmath106 gev at rhic and pb+pb collision at @xmath107 tev at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) for the central collisions ( @xmath108 ) . to take into account for the quark - gluon plasma collective flow ,",
    "we assume for the partons a velocity linear radial profile as @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the transverse radius of the fireball .",
    "the quark and antiquark distribution up to 2 gev are hence given by a thermal distribution with flow : @xmath111 here @xmath112 indicates the spin - color degeneracy of light quarks and antiquarks , and the minus and plus signs are for quarks and antiquarks , respectively .",
    "the temperature is set to @xmath113 .",
    "( [ quark - distr ] ) also applies to gluons after replacing @xmath114 by the gluon spin - color degeneracy @xmath115 and dropping the chemical potential . for the gluon mass , we take it to be similar to that of light quarks in order to take into account non - perturbative effects in the quark - gluon plasma . because @xmath116 , we convert @xmath117 . positions of partons in the transverse direction are taken to have a uniform distribution .",
    "their longitudinal positions are then determined by @xmath118 , as we have assumed bjorken correlation @xmath119 .",
    "the radial flow @xmath120 and the volume @xmath121 ( in one unit of rapidity ) could be in general considered as parameters evaluated accordingly to the typical value of lifetime of the qgp and , assuming a a constant acceleration , we connect the radial expansion with the radial flow @xmath122 .",
    "so the radial flow and the volume are constrained imposing the total multiplicity @xmath123 and the total transverse energy @xmath124 to be equal to the experimental data .",
    "the charged particles multiplicity per unit of rapidity is @xmath125 and the transverse energy @xmath126 at lhc , @xmath127 and @xmath128 at rhic .",
    "this leads for a radial uniform expansion to @xmath129 and @xmath130 at rhic , and @xmath131 and @xmath132 at lhc in quite good agreement also with simulations in hydrodynamical or kinetic transport approaches .",
    "we notice that such a values correspond in one unity of rapidity to a volume of @xmath133 at rhic , while at lhc @xmath134 , which means an increase of a bit more than a factor of two in agreement with the estimate from pion hbt interferometry @xcite .    the baryon chemical potential for quarks @xmath135",
    "is set to reproduce the @xmath136 ratio observed experimentally which means @xmath137 at rhic while at lhc we have approximated @xmath138 to zero .",
    "as in ref.s @xcite the quark and antiquark masses considered are @xmath139 for light quarks , and @xmath140 for strange quarks .",
    "this implies a number of quarks per unit of rapidity within the fireball at rhic is @xmath141 , @xmath142 and @xmath143 . at lhc",
    "there are @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "we also notice that despite the quite different total energy at both rhic and lhc the energy density of the fireball ( with radial flow energy subtracted ) is about @xmath146 in good agreement with the energy density at @xmath147 as evaluated in lattice qcd studies @xcite .    for partons at high transverse momentum , @xmath148 ( see previous section )",
    ", we consider the minijets that have undergone the jet quenching mechanism .",
    "such a parton distribution can be obtained from pqcd calculations . as in ref.@xcite",

    "this is achieved without any adjustment of the coalescence parameter @xmath72 for mesons and baryons and hence can be considered as a real prediction of the model .",
    "we also note that underlying such agreement a key ingredient is the radial flow of the qgp matter . a coalescence model without radial flow could not account for properly neither for the baryon over meson enhancement nor for the single @xmath0 hadron spectra .    with respect to the original paper @xcite the new data",
    "extens to higher @xmath0 , especially for the @xmath5 , and this as allowed to spot some lack of yield for baryons in the @xmath0 region where the coalescence contribution is dying out and fragmentation is taking over , which means at @xmath232 .",
    "it appears that the independent fragmentation approach gives too hard spectra at least up to @xmath149 especially for baryons , similarly to what has been pointed out for charged hadrons in pp collisions @xcite . in aa collisions this result seems to point to the need of an in - medium fragmentation process in agreement with the first results of a shower recombination of quarks from gluon",
    "decays @xcite .",
    "we remind that the coalescence has played an important role in the discussion about the qgp properties not only thanks to the explanation of the baryon / meson enhancement but also because of the approximate quark number scaling observed at rhic and suggested by a simplified approach to a pure coalescence mechanism @xcite . a more realistic approach to coalescence in three dimension with radial flow correlations , finite hadronic wave function widths and resonance decays shows that about a @xmath233 breaking has to be expected at intermediate @xmath0 , and quite larger one at low @xmath0 @xcite correctly predicting the experimental observation @xcite . at lhc energy",
    "experimental data show a larger breaking of the scaling with respect to the one observed at rhic or predicted by more realistic coalescence models",
