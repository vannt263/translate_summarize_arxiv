    "broad absorption line ( bal ) active galactic nuclei ( agn ) show absorption from gas at blueshifted velocities up to 0.2@xmath5 .",
    "they are seen in about one in four of the luminous agn known as quasars , and while most bal agn only show high - ionization absorption ( e.g. , , ) , @xmath610% of bal agn also exhibit low - ionization absorption ( e.g. , , ) , including @xmath63% which in addition show excited absorption ( trump et  al .",
    "2006 , and references therein ) . if all quasars have bal troughs , these percentages represent the fractions of unobscured lines of sight toward quasars along which these three types of troughs exist .",
    "if all quasars go through a bal phase , they represent the fractional amount of time each type exists .",
    "reality is likely somewhere in between . on the one hand , bal and non - bal quasar spectra are very similar , arguing that they are drawn from a single parent population ( weymann et  al .",
    "1991 ; reichard et  al .",
    "2003 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the likelihood of observing a low - ionization bal trough increases during a transition phase between ultraluminous infrared galaxies and quasars ( canalizo & stockton 2001 ) , although the origin of the bal troughs in such objects is an open question ; a disk wind origin for them remains possible .",
    "the physical parameters of bal systems need to be constrained to understand their origin(s ) and contribution to agn feedback effects on galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "however , saturation and blending effects mean that the physical parameters of typical bal systems can not be easily inferred .",
    "instead , it is often the more unusual systems that can provide such constraints .",
    "currently the rarest known absorption in bal agn is balmer - line absorption .",
    "it has previously been reported only in ngc  4151 ( hutchings et  al .",
    "2002 , and references therein ) and sdss  j083942.11 + 380526.3 ( aoki et  al . 2006 ) .",
    "weak absorption similar to that found in those objects has also recently been seen in h@xmath0 and h@xmath7 in the quasar fbqs j2107@xmath80620 through high - resolution spectroscopy ( hutsemekers et al .",

    "i report a quasar with very strong balmer - line absorption found in the sloan digital sky survey data release five ( adelman - mccarthy et  al . 2007 ) .",
    "these two new discoveries confirm the observation of aoki et  al .",
    "( 2006 ) that balmer - line bal troughs are found in iron low - ionization bal quasars with relatively strong [ ] emission .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et  al .",
    "2000 ) is using a drift - scanning imaging camera ( gunn et  al .",
    "1998 ) on a 2.5-m telescope ( gunn et  al . 2006 ) to image 10@xmath9deg@xmath10 of sky on the sdss @xmath11 ab magnitude system ( fukugita et  al . 1996",

    "( 2002 ) , quasar candidates are targeted for spectroscopy because their colors differ from the colors of the stellar locus or because they are unresolved objects with radio emission detected by the first survey ( becker , white , & helfand 1995 ) .    sdss j125942.80 + 121312.6 ( hereafter sdss j1259 + 1213 ) was observed on modified julian date 53473 with sdss plate # 1695 and fiber # 75 .",
    "it has a galactic extinction corrected magnitude @xmath19 and was targeted both via its colors and its radio emission .",

    "the deepest balmer absorption is blueshifted further , to @xmath28 , which is @xmath29kms@xmath26  from the narrow - line redshift .",
    "the continuum drop shortward of @xmath62600  rest frame is due to partial covering of the quasar by overlapping absorption from multiple transitions ( e.g. , hall et  al .",

    "2002 . ) for example , the lower term of @xmath31 , tentatively identified in figure 1 , is at 5.91 ev above ground .",
    "there is no sign of metastable absorption , but the limits are not strong since those transitions suffer from confusion with absorption from and h8 .",
    "lastly , the [ ] emission - line profile may have a complex blueshifted component , or it may just be confused with the strong emission in that region of the spectrum .",
    "balmer line absorption is often seen in galaxy spectra , but this object can not be explained as an unusual galaxy .",
    "first , the emission and broad absorption in ultraviolet and transitions is consistent only with a bal quasar .",
    "second , when post - starburst galaxies exhibit strong balmer absorption , it lies at the same redshift as the [ ] and [ ] emission and is accompanied by a strong balmer break lacking in this object .",
    "third , when low - ionization outflows are seen in star - forming galaxies , they do not occur at velocities as high as 3000  kms@xmath26 unless they are clearly bal troughs associated with an agn ( rupke , veilleux , & sanders 2005 ) .",
    "the balmer absorption troughs in this object have widths which are uniform within the measurement uncertainties : @xmath32  kms@xmath26 . to estimate the depths of the troughs ,",
    "the continuum was fitted with a fourth - order polynomial in @xmath33 vs. @xmath34 to approximate a power - law with possible slight dust reddening ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "the maximum single - pixel depth of each trough was measured from the normalized sdss spectrum after smoothing by a 7-pixel boxcar .",
    "the depths of the troughs ( table 1 ) decrease slowly as the upper term of the transition increases .",
    "the decline is about a factor of two from h@xmath0 to h9 .",
    "the absorption therefore must be saturated , since the transition oscillator strengths decline by a factor of _ twenty - two _ from h@xmath0 to h9 .",
    "the percentage absorption depth in a trough @xmath35 is @xmath36 for an absorber with optical depth @xmath37 and percentage covering factor @xmath38 in the relevant ion ( e.g. , eq .",
    "1 of hall et  al .",
    "2003 ) . by assuming @xmath38 and @xmath39 , @xmath40 for every balmer trough can be calculated since their relative @xmath41 are determined by their known oscillator strengths .",
    "acceptable matches to the maximum absorption depths of the balmer lines were found with @xmath42 and @xmath43 at the velocity of maximum depth ( table 1 ) ; note that larger @xmath41 requires smaller @xmath38 for an equally good fit .",
    "the additional depth in the h@xmath0 trough is assumed to come from coverage of the h@xmath0 emission line .",
    ", then the flux removed by very high optical depth absorption ( @xmath44 ) is @xmath45 , allowing for different covering factors @xmath38 of each component .",
    "since the normalization only used the continuum , the depths in table 1 are @xmath46 .",
    "thus , @xmath47 is possible when the line flux @xmath48 is substantial , as is the case for h@xmath0 in this object . ]",
    "this approximate @xmath39 assumes the balmer - line troughs are resolved and takes into account neither possible balmer emission from the absorber itself ( as in the resonance scattering model of branch et  al .",
    "2002 ; see also casebeer et  al .",
    "2004 ) nor possible different covering factors for the continuum source , balmer emission lines and emission - line blends .",
    "a high - resolution spectrum is needed to properly model all those parameters and determine how greatly they affect results inferred from an sdss - resolution spectrum .",
    "absorption from the @xmath1 shell of hydrogen requires a substantial population in that shell .",
    "one obvious population mechanism is collisional excitation into @xmath1 due to a high density .",
    "the relevant critical density is @xmath49 at @xmath50=10,000  k ( osterbrock & ferland 2006 ) .",
    "it is possible to estimate @xmath3 using our estimate for @xmath39 and the relationship , @xmath51 ( e.g. , eq .  12 of hall et  al .",
    "thus , @xmath52 , assuming an absorber of fixed width @xmath53 with all @xmath41 independent of velocity . ]",
    "@xmath54 , where the ratio of the populations of the @xmath55 and @xmath1 shells is @xmath56 . for @xmath50=10,000  k , @xmath57 , and so @xmath58",
    "when @xmath42 .",
    "this would imply @xmath59 if collisional excitation was the only mechanism populating @xmath1 .",
    "however , at such large @xmath3 there is another effect which populates the @xmath1 shell : ly@xmath2 trapping ( ferland & netzer 1979 ) .",
    "as shown in the previous paragraph , an absorber with balmer optical depths as large as observed here must have a very large ly@xmath2 optical depth .",
    "in such an absorber , soft x - rays from the quasar will ionize at large @xmath3 and create ly@xmath2 photons at those depths via recombination .",
    "every ly@xmath2 photon so created will be re - absorbed approximately @xmath3 times before it escapes , and so the @xmath1 population for a given density and temperature will be increased by a factor of @xmath3 .",
    "this increase changes the value of @xmath3 inferred for a given @xmath39 , and thus the column density needed to explain a given @xmath39 . when ly@xmath2 trapping is occurring , @xmath60^{1/2}$ ] . for our observed @xmath39 and @xmath61k , appropriate for partially ionized gas illuminated by a quasar ( figure 14.5 of osterbrock & ferland 2006 ) , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the h@xmath0 optical depth yields an estimate of the column density of neutral hydrogen in the @xmath1 shell ( eq .  12 of hall et  al .",
    "2003 ) , assuming a uniform optical depth over the entire 2000 km s@xmath26 trough : @xmath64 . combining the estimates for @xmath65 and @xmath66 yields @xmath67 in the absorber .",
    "as is usual for bal agn , @xmath68 is likely to be much higher .",
    "ly@xmath2 trapping eliminates the need for an absorber with a density above the critical density needed for significant collsional excitation .",
    "in fact , @xmath69 becomes an _",
    "limit on the density in the absorber in order to avoid _ overpopulating _ the @xmath1 shell through collisions as well as ly@xmath2 trapping .",
    "since that would produce balmer - line optical depths greater than are observed , the density in an absorber at @xmath61k must be @xmath70 .    for ly@xmath2 trapping to occur , the absorber must retain a relatively large neutral hydrogen column despite exposure to the quasar s ionizing continuum .",
    "quasar absorbers with blueshifted neutral hydrogen columns that large located relatively close to the quasar are rare along our sightlines to bright quasars , either because such columns cover a very small total solid angle or are very short - lived phenomena .",
    "however , ly@xmath2 trapping is expected to occur in quasar low - ionization broad emission line regions .",
    "sdss  j1259 + 0931  may be a case where the continuum source is partially viewed through such gas .",
    "finally , it should be mentioned that an absorber with a high temperature rather than a high @xmath71 could in principle produce the observed balmer absorption .",
    "for example , @xmath72  k yields equal populations in the @xmath55 and @xmath1 shells of",
    ". however , this explanation is unlikely because gas at such temperatures is unstable to rapid cooling ( krolik 1999 ) .",
    "the quasar sdss  j1259 + 0931  has the strongest balmer - line bal troughs discovered to date .",
    "the required population of the @xmath1 shell of most likely arises from ly@xmath2 trapping in an absorber exposed to the quasar s ionizing continuum but still containing a high column of ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "in addition , the detection of this quasar in the rest - frame optical and ultraviolet means the absorber is neither compton - thick nor particularly dust - rich .",
    "the rarity of such balmer - line bal troughs ( found in @xmath731% of bal quasars ) indicates they have a very small global covering factor or are very transient .",
    "however , their incidence may be underestimated because for high - redshift bal agn the balmer lines are redshifted beyond the typical spectral coverage of a discovery spectrum .",
    "even when that is not the case , weak balmer absorption can easily be missed ( e.g. , the absorption in fbqs j2107@xmath80620 was discovered only through high - resolution spectroscopic followup ) .    to improve our understanding of quasar winds",
    "requires observations of specific objects for which multiple physical parameters in the absorbers can be constrained .",
    "thus , follow - up observations of sdss  j1259 + 0931  would be quite valuable .",
    "x - ray observations can constrain the total absorbing column .",
    "echelle spectroscopy can put a lower limit on the ionized hydrogen column by searching for absorption from metastable , which is populated by recombination from .",
    "such spectroscopy would also reveal any variability or structure in the balmer - line troughs and enable detailed modelling of the balmer and excited emission and absorption to constrain the absorber s density and ionization state and thus its distance from the ionizing source .",
    "a near - ir spectroscopic search for paschen absorption can constrain the population in the @xmath74 shell of .",
    "near - ir spectroscopy of h@xmath2 can help constrain the contribution of any ` fill - in ' balmer emission from the absorber itself .",
    "such emission should be @xmath64 times stronger in h@xmath2 than in h@xmath0 given the balmer and inferred lyman optical depths of the absorber ( cox & mathews 1969 ) .",
    "sdss  j1259 + 0931  is detected by 2mass with @xmath75 and @xmath76 , placing moderate resolution near - ir spectroscopy within the reach of 8m - class telescopes .",
