    "hd  49933 is a main sequence solar - type star that was observed by corot .",
    "it is the first stellar object where solar - like oscillations were clearly detected in the photometric signal @xcite .",
    "there has been some controversy over the original labelling of the oscillation frequencies with their mode degrees , and in this work we present results based on the data published by @xcite , although we note that since this publication there has been a preference among the scientific community towards an inverted mode - labelling @xcite .",
    "we present two independent methods of fitting the observational data , while placing an emphasis on defining the boundaries of the parameter space where the model of this star lies .",
    "the best - fitting models are determined using the levenberg - marquardt ( lm ) and markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) algorithms , while the uncertainties and the form of the parameter space that is constrained by the set of observations is described by both singular value decomposition ( svd ) and mcmc .",
    "we use the frequencies from @xcite , and we compute the frequency separations to use as the observational data to model .",
    "the stellar models are computed using astec @xcite which include the eff equation of state , opal 95 opacities together with kurucz low - t opacities , nacre reaction rates and overshooting , and the oscillation frequencies are calculated with adipls @xcite .",
    "using as observational constraints the @xmath6 frequency separations , @xmath7 $ ] from @xcite , we obtain the following set of stellar parameters for hd  49933 using lm : @xmath8 m@xmath9 , age = 2.9 gyr , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 1.39 r@xmath9 .",
    "@xmath13 was fixed , and the analysis was repeated using various initial parameter values @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : lm ] , each dot is the result of a minimization , clearly showing a sensitivity to the initial guess .",
    "this sensitivity is not uncommon for local methods , however , when we repeated our analysis using the data from @xcite we found a rather stable solution of @xmath14 m@xmath9 , age = 2.5 gyr , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath12 1.44 r@xmath9 .",
    "markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) algorithms allows one to perform stochastic samplings of probability densities using properties of markov chains .",
    "this is a bayesian methodology and we use it to estimate the posterior probability density function ( pdf ) of the parameter(s ) of our stellar model .",
    "the strength of this approach is that , once the pdf is derived , we can apply the classical tools of statistical inference to estimate the stellar parameters and associated confidence intervals  a long - standing problem in stellar physics @xcite .",
    "this methodology was applied successfully to @xmath17  cen a @xcite .",
    "we ran the mcmc algorithm using two different values of initial parameters ( @xmath18 @xmath3 , @xmath19 ) while including a prior on @xmath2 for the first run only . using the same observational constraints as those described in sect .  2 , we computed the marginal distributions of the global stellar properties . using their mean values as the best - fitting parameter and considering the standard deviation of the sample as the corresponding 1-@xmath20 error bar , we obtain @xmath21 m@xmath9 , age = @xmath22gyr , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .",
    "however , we also find that the second mcmc run hints at a possible ( much less populated ) alternative solution with a mass near 1.2 @xmath3 .",
    "when we obtain the best - fitting set of parameters @xmath25 , then locally the models can be described as linear . with this assumption",
    ", we proceed to calculate the svd ( @xmath26 ) of the matrix @xmath27 , where @xmath28 are the observables and @xmath20 the observational errors .",
    "the matrix @xmath29 describes the @xmath30-dimensional ( in our case @xmath31 parameter correlations ( essentially 4  4-element vectors ) , while @xmath32 describes the magnitudes of these vectors .",
    "[ fig : svd1 ] shows the ( longest ) two - dimensional projections of the four - dimensional vectors , for the parameters of @xmath0 , age and @xmath2 .",
    "these 2-d vectors are represented by the red arrows in the figures , and the black ellipses are the error - ellipses defined by these vectors .",
    "[ fig : svd1 ] shows the error ellipses described by svd .",
    "the models generated from the mcmc runs are represented by the blue dots , with the size of the dots proportional to the likelihood values calculated from the mcmc ( i.e. larger dots are more likely to be the true models ) .",
    "the error ellipses clearly encloses most of the ( good ) models from the mcmc method .",
    "this is strong evidence that , although we are assuming linearity for these models , the analytical approximation describes quite well the correlations that we expect to find , and the magnitudes of these correlations .    because svd gives a good indication of the shape of the parameter spaces , we can use it to investigate the effects of including extra observational constraints . in fig .",
    "[ fig : svd2 ] we compare the two - dimensional error - ellipses for various parameters when using the same constraints as fig .",
    "[ fig : svd1 ] ( black ellipses ) , and then including the large frequency separations from the @xmath33 modes ( blue ellipses ) . the allowed parameter spaces defined by the extra set of constraints",
    "is reduced in volume by a factor of 2 for the 4 parameters , and the individual uncertainties are reduced by a significant amount for @xmath2 and @xmath17",

    "the various colours indicate different initial guesses of the parameters , all having fixed @xmath13 except for the red dots which have fixed @xmath35 .",

    "we have analysed the seismic data from hd  49933 and we have found that the global stellar properties using two independent methods ( local and global ) are in agreement .",

    "we also studied the parameter space defining the correlations and uncertainties using the analytical approach of svd .",
    "the results from the global mcmc validated the analytical description .",
    "in particular we found that including the @xmath33 frequency separations should reduce the volume of parameter space by at least a factor of two in all dimensions , with the individual parameter uncertainties reducing significantly for @xmath2 and @xmath17 .",
