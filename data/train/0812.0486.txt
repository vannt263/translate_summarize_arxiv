    "we consider some well known families of two - player , zero - sum , turn - based , perfect information games that can be viewed as specical cases of shapley s stochastic games @xcite .",
    "they have appeared under various names in the literature in the last 50 years and variants of them have been rediscovered many times by various research communities . for brevity , in this paper we shall refer to them by the name of the researcher who first ( as far as we know ) singled them out .    * * condon games * @xcite ( a.k.a .",
    "simple stochastic games ) .",
    "a condon game is given by a directed graph @xmath0 with a partition of the vertices into @xmath1 ( vertices beloning to player 1 , @xmath2 ( vertices belonging to player 2 ) , @xmath3 ( random vertices ) , and a special terminal vertex * 1*. vertices of @xmath3 have exactly two outgong arcs , the terminal vertex * 1 * has none , while all vertices in @xmath4 have at least one outgoing arc . between moves ,",
    "a pebble is resting at one of the vertices @xmath5 .",
    "if @xmath5 belongs to a player , this player should strategically pick an outgoing arc from @xmath5 and move the pebble along this edge to another vertex .",
    "if @xmath5 is a vertex in @xmath3 , nature picks an outgoing arc from @xmath5 uniformly at random and moves the pebble along this arc .",
    "the objective of the game for player 1 is to reach * 1 * and should play so as to maximize his probability of doing so .",
    "the objective for player 2 is to prevent player 1 from reaching * 1*. * * gillette games * @xcite . a gillette game @xmath6 is given by a finite set of states @xmath7 , partioned into @xmath8 ( states belonging to player 1 ) and @xmath9 ( states belonging to player 2 ) .",
    "to each state @xmath5 is associated a finite set of possible actions . to each such action",
    "is associated a real - valued _ reward _ and a probability distribution on states . at any point in time of play ,",
    "the game is in a particular state @xmath10 .",
    "the player to move chooses an action strategically and the corresponding award is paid by player 2 to player 1 .",
    "then , nature chooses the next state at random according to the probability distribution associated with the action .",
    "the play continues forever and the accumulated reward may therefore be unbounded .",
    "fortunately , there are ways of associating a finite payoff to the players in spite of this and more ways than one ( so @xmath6 is not just one game , but really a family of games ) : for _ discounted _ gillette games , we fix a _ discount factor _ @xmath11 and define the payoff to player 1 to be @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the reward incurred at stage @xmath10 of the game .",
    "we shall denote the resulting game @xmath14 . for _ undiscounted _ gillette game",
    "we define the payoff to player 1 to be the _ limiting average _",
    "payoff @xmath15 we shall denote the resulting game @xmath16 .",
    "undiscounted gillette games have recently been referred to as _ stochastic mean - payoff _ games in the computer science literature @xcite .",
    "a natural restriction of gillette games is to _ deterministic _ transitions ( i.e. , all probability distributions put all probability mass on one state ) .",
    "this class of games has been studied in the computer science literature under the names of cyclic games @xcite and mean - payoff games @xcite .",
    "a _ strategy _ for a game is a ( possibly randomized ) procedure for selecting which arc or action to take , given the history of the play so far .",
    "a _ pure , positional strategy _ is the very special case of this where the choice is deterministic and only depends on the current vertex ( or state ) , i.e. , a pure , positional strategy is simply a map from vertices ( for gillette games , states ) to vertices ( for gillette games , actions ) .",
    "a strategy @xmath17 for player 1 is said to be _ optimal _ if for all vertices ( states ) @xmath10 it holds that , @xmath18 where @xmath8 @xmath19 is the set of strategies for player 1 ( player 2 ) and @xmath20 is the probability that player 1 will end up in * 1 * ( for the case of condon games ) or the expected payoff of player 1 ( for the case of gillette games ) when players play using the strategy profile @xmath21 and the play starts in vertex ( state ) @xmath10 .",
    "similarly , a strategy @xmath22 for player 2 is said to be optimal if @xmath23 for all games described here , a proof of liggett and lippman @xcite ( fixing a bug of a proof of gillette @xcite ) shows that there are optimal , pure , positional strategies and that a pair of such strategies form an exact nash equilibrium of the game .",
    "these facts imply that when testing whether conditions ( [ opt1 ] ) and ( [ opt2 ] ) holds , it is enough to take the inifima and suprema over the finite set of pure , positional strategies of the players .    in this paper , we consider _ solving _ games . by solving a game we mean the task of computing a pair of optimal pure , positional strategies , given a description of the game as input .",
    "to be able to finitely represent the games , we assume that the discount factor , rewards and probabilities are rational numbers and given as fractions",
    ".    it is well known that condon games can be seen as a special case of undiscounted gillette games ( as described in the proof of lemma 4 below ) , but a priori , solving gillette games could be harder .",
    "a recent paper by chatterjee and henzinger @xcite shows that solving so - called stochastic parity games @xcite reduces to solving undiscounted gillette games .",
    "this motivates the study of the complexity of the latter task .",
    "we show that the extra expressive power ( compared to condon games ) of having rewards during the game in fact does not change the computational complexity of solving the games .",
    "more precisely , our main theorem is :    the following tasks are polynomial time equivalent :    1 .   solving condon games ( a.k.a .. , simple stochastic games ) 2 .   solving undiscounted gillette games ( a.k.a , stochastic mean - payoff games ) with rewards and probabilities represented in binary notation .",
    "3 .   solving undiscounted gillette games with rewards and probabilities represented in unary notation .",
    "4 .   solving discounted gillette games with discount factor , rewards and probabilities represented in binary notation .",
    "in particular , there is a pseudopolynomial time algorithm for solving undiscounted gillette games if and only if there is a polynomial time algorithm for this task .",
    "the theorem follows from the lemmas 2,3,4 below and the fact that solving games with numbers in the input represented in unary trivially reduces to solving games with numbers in the input represented in binary .",
    "the proof techniques are fairly standard ( although coming from two different communities ) , but we find it worth pointing out that they together imply the theorem above since it is relevant , did not seem to be known , and may even be considered slightly surprising , as deterministic undiscounted gillette games can be solved in pseudopolynomial time @xcite , while solving them in polynomial time remains a challenging open problem .",
    "an even more challenging problem is solving simple stochastic games in polynomial time , so our theorem may be interpreted as a hardness result .",
    "note that a `` missing bullet '' in the theorem is solving discounted gillette games given in unary notation .",
    "it is in fact known that this can be done in polynomial time ( even if only the discount factor is given in unary while rewards and probabilities are given in binary ) , see littman ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.4 ) .",
    "[ limit ] let @xmath6 be a gillette game with @xmath24 states and all transition probabilities and rewards being fractions with integral numerators and denominators , all of absolute value at most @xmath25 .",
    "let @xmath26 and let @xmath27 $ ] .",
    "then , any optimal pure stationary strategy ( for either player ) in the discounted gillette game @xmath28 is also an optimal strategy in the undiscounted gillette game @xmath16 .",
    "the fact that _ some _ @xmath29 with the desired property exists is explicit in the proof of theorem 1 of liggett and lippman @xcite . here",
    ", we derive a concrete value for @xmath29 . from the proof of liggett and lippman",
    ", we have that for @xmath17 to be an optimal pure stationary strategy ( for player 1 ) in @xmath16 , it is sufficient to be an optimal pure stationary strategy in @xmath14 for all values of @xmath30 sufficiently close to @xmath31 , i.e. , to satisfy the inequalities @xmath32 for all states @xmath10 and for all values of @xmath30 sufficiently close to @xmath31 , where @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) is the set of pure , positional , strategies for player 1 ( 2 ) and @xmath35 is the expected payoff when game starts in position @xmath10 and the discount factor is @xmath30 .",
    "similarly , for @xmath22 to be an optimal pure stationary strategy ( for player 1 ) in @xmath36 , it is sufficient to be an optimal pure stationary strategy in @xmath14 for all values of @xmath30 sufficiently close to @xmath31 , i.e. , to satisfy the inequalities @xmath37 so , we can prove the lemma by showing that for all states @xmath10 and _ all _ pure stationary strategies @xmath38 , the sign of @xmath39 is the same for all @xmath40 .",
    "for fixed strategies @xmath41 we have that @xmath42 is the expected total reward in a _ discounted markov process _ and is therefore given by the formula ( see @xcite ) @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the vector of @xmath45 values , one for each state , @xmath46 is the matrix of transition probabilities and @xmath47 is the vector of rewards ( note that for _ fixed _ positional strategies @xmath41 , rewards can be assigned to states in the natural way ) .",
    "let @xmath48 .",
    "then , ( [ closed ] ) is a system of linear equations in the unknowns @xmath44 , where each coefficient is of the form @xmath49 where @xmath50 are rational numbers with numerators with absolute value bounded by @xmath51 and with denominators with absolute value bounded by @xmath25 . by multiplying the equations with all denominators",
    ", we can in fact assume that @xmath50 are integers of absolute value less than @xmath52 .",
    "solving the equations using cramer s rule , we may write an entry of @xmath44 as a quotient between determinants of @xmath53 matrices containing terms of the form @xmath54 .",
    "the determinant of such a matrix is a polynomial in @xmath55 of degree @xmath24 with the coefficient of each term being of absolute value at most @xmath56 .",
    "we denote these two polynomials @xmath57 .",
    "arguing similarly about @xmath58 and deriving corresponding polynomials @xmath59 , we have that @xmath60 is equivalent to @xmath61 , i.e. , @xmath62 . letting @xmath63",
    ", we have that @xmath64 is a polynomial in @xmath55 , with integer coefficients , all of absolute value at most @xmath65 .",
    "since @xmath66 , the sign of @xmath67 is the same for all @xmath68 , i.e. , for all @xmath40 .",
    "this completes the proof .    solving undiscounted gillette games ( with binary representation of rewards and probabilities )",
    "polynomially reduces to solving discounted gillette games ( with binary representation of discount factor , rewards , and probabilities ) .",
    "this follows immediately from lemma [ limit ] by observing that the binary representation of the number @xmath26 has length polynomial in the size of the representation of the game .",
    "solving discounted gillette game ( with binary representation of discount factor , rewards , and probabilities ) polynomially reduces to solving condon games .",
    "zwick and paterson @xcite considered solving _ deterministic _ discounted gillette games , i.e. , gillette games where the action deterministically determines the transition taken .",
    "it is natural to try to generalize their reduction so that it also works for general discounted gillette games .",
    "since condon games allows for vertices making random choices , a natural attempt is to simply simulate a stochastic transition by such random vertices .",
    "such a generalization is made even easier by the fact that zwick and paterson proved that solving `` augmented '' condon games where random vertices are allowed to take choices given by arbitrary discrete distributions with rational probability weights ( represented in binary ) is polynomially equivalent to solving `` plain '' condon games .",
    "we find that the reduction outlined above is indeed correct , even though the correctness proof of zwick and paterson has to be modified slightly compared to their proof .",
    "the details follow .",
    "we are given as input a gillette game form @xmath6 and a discount factor @xmath30 and must produce an augmented condon game @xmath69 whose solution yields the solution to the gillette game @xmath14 .",
    "first , we affinely scale and translate all rewards of @xmath6 so that they are in the interval @xmath70 $ ] .",
    "this does not influence the optimal strategies .",
    "vertices of @xmath69 include all states of @xmath6 ( belonging to the same player in @xmath69 as in @xmath6 ) , and , in addition , a random vertex @xmath71 for each possible action @xmath72 of each state @xmath5 of @xmath6 .",
    "we also add a `` trapping '' vertex * 0 * with a single arc to itself .",
    "it does not matter which player it belongs to .",
    "we construct the arcs of @xmath69 by adding , for each ( state , action ) pair @xmath73 the `` gadget '' indicated in figure [ fig ] .     reducing discounted gillette games to condon games , height=226 ]    to be precise",
    ", if the action has reward @xmath47 and leads to states @xmath74 with probability weights @xmath75 , we include in @xmath69 an arc from @xmath5 to @xmath71 , arcs from @xmath71 to @xmath76 with probability weights @xmath77 , an arc from @xmath71 to * 0 * with probability weight @xmath78 and finally an arc from @xmath71 to the terminal * 1 * with probability weight @xmath79 .    there is clearly a 1 - 1 correspondence between pure stationary strategies in @xmath6 and in @xmath69 .",
    "thus , we are done if we show that the optimal strategies coincide . to see this , fix a strategy profile for the two players and consider play starting in any vertex @xmath5 . by construction , if the expected reward of the play in @xmath6 is @xmath80 , the probability that the play in @xmath69 ends up in * 1 * is exactly @xmath81 .",
    "therefore , the two games are strategically equivalent .",
    "solving condon games polynomially reduces to solving undiscounted gillette games with _ unary _ representation of rewards and probabilities .",
    "we are given a condon game @xmath6 ( a `` plain '' one , using the terminology of the previous proof ) and must construct an undiscounted gillette game @xmath69 .",
    "states of @xmath69 will coincide with vertices of @xmath6 , with the states of @xmath69 including the special terminals * 1*. vertices @xmath5 belonging to a player in @xmath6 belongs to the same player in @xmath69 .",
    "for each outgoing arc of @xmath5 , we add an action in @xmath69 with reward 0 , and with a deterministic transition to the endpoint of the arc of @xmath6",
    ". random vertices of @xmath6 can be assigned to either player in @xmath69 , but he will only be given a single `` dummy choice '' : if the random vertex has arcs to @xmath82 and @xmath83 , we add a single action in @xmath69 with reward @xmath84 and transitions into @xmath82 , @xmath83 , both with probability weight @xmath85 . the terminal * 1 * can be assigned to either player in @xmath69 , but again he will be given only a dummy choice : we add a single action with reward 1 from * 1 * and with a transition back into * 1 * with probability weight @xmath31 .",
    "there is clearly a 1 - 1 correspondence between pure stationary strategies in @xmath6 and strategies in @xmath69 .",
    "thus , we are done if we show that the optimal strategies coincide . to see this , fix a strategy profile for the two players and consider play starting in any vertex @xmath5 . by construction , if the probability of the play ending up in * 1 * in @xmath6 is @xmath64 , the expected limiting average reward of the play in @xmath69 is also @xmath64 .",
    "therefore , the two games are strategically equivalent , and we are done .",
    "undiscounted gillette games can be seen as generalizations of condon games and yet they are computationally equivalent .",
    "it is interesting to ask if further generalizations of gillette games are also equivalent to solving condon games .",
    "it seems natural to restrict attention to cases where it is known that optimal , positional strategies exists .",
    "this precludes general stochastic games ( but see @xcite ) .",
    "an interesting class of games generalizing undiscounted gillette games was considered by filar @xcite .",
    "filar s games allow simultaneous moves by the two players . however ,",
    "for any position , the probability distribution on the next position can depend on the action of one player only .",
    "filar shows that his games are guaranteed to have optimal , positional strategies .",
    "the optimal strategies are not necessarily pure , but the probabilities they assign to actions are guaranteed to be rational numbers if rewards and probabilities are rational numbers .",
