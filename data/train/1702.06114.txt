    "it is known that quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , has two very important properties , namely asymptotic freedom and confinement .",
    "the former implies that at high momentum transfers , the quarks behave as quasi free particles , i.e. , the interaction between two quarks due to gluon interchange can be treated using perturbation theory . for this momentum range",
    ", the dispersion processes can be then be calculated with a very good precision . by contrast ,",
    "at low momentum exchange among the quarks ( @xmath0  gev ) qcd is highly nonlinear and leads to quark confinement .",
    "several approximate methods have been developed to study the physical processes among quarks in the low momentum range of qcd . among them",
    "is lattice qcd , which tries to solve the qcd equations of motion numerically on a discretized space - time grid@xcite .",
    "this method , however , presents problems if extended to finite chemical potentials@xcite .",
    "another option is to use effective qcd models , like the nambu  jona - lasinio model ( njl ) , which is described by a lagrangian which accounts for the main features of qcd at low energies .",
    "the advantage of njl models is that they can be extended to finite chemical potentials easily .",
    "local as well as non - local extensions of the model have been studied in the literature ( see , for instance , refs . , and references therein ) .",
    "non - local extensions of the njl model at zero temperature have been used to study hybrid stars with and/or without a quark - hadron mixed phases in their inner cores ( see ref .  , and references therein ) . here",
    ", we present an extension of such studies to finite temperatures in order to explore the role of a quark - hadron phase transition for proto - neutron stars or core collapse supernovae .",
    "the euclidean effective action of the model presented in this paper is for the non - local 3-flavor polyakov njl model , including the vector interactions among quarks .",

    "the temperatures generally achieved in the inner 50% of the stellar core at the peak of the heating are in the range of 30 to 50 mev . following the heating",

    "we have constructed models for the equation of state of hot quark matter in the framework of the n3pnjl model .",
    "knowledge of the equation of state , a possible critical end point ( cep ) , and the nature of the phase transition in the qcd phase diagram itself are critical for a better understanding of the strongly interacting matter at high densities and/or temperatures .",
    "we have found that quark confinement as described by the polyakov loop modifies the phase diagram by increasing the transitions temperatures .",
    "the inclusion of vector interactions among quarks , on other hand , changes the location of the cep .",
    "also , vector interactions stiffen the equation of state , while the inclusion of neutrinos has the opposite effect ( softens the equation of state ) .",
    "one of the main motivations of this study concerns the possible occurrence of quark matter inside of proto - neutron stars .",
    "one of the mechanism for the formation of quark matter in the inner cores of such stars could be the nucleation of quark matter drops due to the high pressure environment ( high compression ) that exists in the centers of proto - neutron star@xcite .",
