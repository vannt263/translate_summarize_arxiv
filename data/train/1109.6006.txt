    "the progenitors of planetary nebulae ( pne ) are generally considered to have once been main - sequence stars with masses of up to @xmath9 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , yet a practical demonstration of such a link has so far been limited by the paucity of pne associated with intermediate - age open clusters , where physically - associated , lower - mass , main - sequence progenitors may exist .",
    "searches for possible planetary nebula ( pn)/open cluster associations have revealed a number of potential spatial coincidences , as noted by @xcite and lubos kohoutek ( see * ? ? ? * ) , but available data on possible matches in radial velocity , reddening , and distance of the pne and cluster stars are as yet unconvincing ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . the relatively short duration of the pn evolutionary phase and the rapid rate of dissolution of open clusters conspire to make true physical links relatively rare , if they exist at all @xcite .",
    "the distances to individual pne are also difficult to establish , resulting in a variety of techniques applied to the problem @xcite .",
    "if the central star is bright enough for photometric or spectroscopic observation , the distance can often be established through trigonometric or spectroscopic parallax .",
    "trigonometric parallaxes , for example , have been derived for several pne through the u.s .",
    "naval observatory program @xcite , from measurements by the hipparcos satellite ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and most recently by measurements with the hubble space telescope ( hst , * ? ? ?",
    "spectroscopic parallaxes produce mixed results ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which may relate to the models used and the quality of spectra for faint stars .",
    "nebular expansion parallaxes have also been applied @xcite , despite their observational limitations @xcite and initial assumptions @xcite .",
    "indirect methods also exist , the most basic being the shklovsky distance method @xcite , which is tied to estimates for the surface brightness of the surrounding pn shell , thus being limited by the difficulties of recording the spectra of pne .",
    "improved versions of the technique ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) typically involve measurement of the radio continuum surface brightness temperature @xmath10 . finally , it is possible to infer distances to pne by using the reddening inferred from a comparison of line strengths for emission features in their spectra in conjunction with maps of reddening versus distance for stars observed along the line of sight to the nebula @xcite .",
    "the recent iphas @xmath11 survey of the galactic plane has generated extensive visible / infrared photometry for many stars in the fields of pne , thereby permitting extension of the technique to a greater selection of pne @xcite , as done by @xcite .    as a result of many such studies ,",
    "distance estimates for pne appear to fall into two categories : a `` short '' scale advocated by groups such as @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , and a `` long '' scale tied to the results of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the `` short '' scale is supported by trigonometric parallaxes of pne central stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although the relative proximity to the sun for such objects makes them less - than - ideal for such an assessment .",
    "a more definitive test could be made by membership of a pn in a distant open cluster , but , as noted above , the pn phase is relatively short - lived , more than 99% of open clusters capable of housing their progenitors have dissolved by the time they are old enough to produce one , and most cases examined so far are line - of - sight projections rather than physical associations @xcite .",
    "a new case of a planetary nebula / open cluster association was recently discovered by @xcite involving the planetary nebula abell 8 ( pn g167.000.9 ) with the cluster bica 6 .",
    "abell 8 was discovered on palomar observatory sky survey images by @xcite , and the associated cluster by bica ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; its present designation is from the 2009 update of the open cluster catalogue of @xcite .",
    "preliminary parameters for bica 6 from 2mass _ jhk@xmath12 _ data imply a cluster age of @xmath13 gyr @xcite , indicating a progenitor star of less than @xmath14 .",
    "it is a sparse cluster with an as - yet uncertain implied reddening and distance , a feature that might be resolved through a photometric and spectroscopic study at visible wavelengths .",
    "presented here are new observations of that type revealing interesting characteristics of the cluster and its embedded planetary nebula , and strengthening the case for their association .",
    "it is also noted here that the central star of abell 8 appears to be double at far infrared wavelengths , a characteristic not seen in the visual region .",
    "that point requires further study , since the detection is at the brightness limits of the 2mass survey .",

    "<S> the central star of the planetary nebula has a reddening of @xmath6 , with a possible circumnebular excess , and an estimated luminosity of @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> it is also an optical double in 2mass images , with a likely progenitor according to evolutionary considerations being a late b - type dwarf of @xmath8 . </S>"
