    "it is well known that kiloparsec scale jets of radio loud agns consist of many bright knots seen in x - ray and optical in addition to the radio bands .",
    "for this decade the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ has detected large scale jets for tens of objects with a sub - arcsecond resolution . combining with radio and optical observations with similar spatial resolution , offsets between different observation bands",
    "have been noticed , e.g. , for m87 @xcite , cen a @xcite , pks 1127 - 145 @xcite , 3c 66b @xcite and 3c 31 @xcite .",
    "it is intriguing that almost always the centroids of x - ray knots are located closer to the core than those of lower frequencies . in m87 @xcite ,",
    "the centroids of optical knots are closer to the core than their radio counterparts ( for a recent review , see @xcite ) .",
    "while the emission mechanism of radio through optical emission is believed to be synchrotron radiation by relativistic electrons , several mechanisms are proposed for x - ray emission .",
    "x - rays from the knots of fr i galaxies such as m87 , cen a , 3c 66b and 3c 31 are well interpreted with synchrotron radiation by multi - tev energy electrons , while for quasars such as pks 1127 - 145 the mechanism has not been settled yet .",
    "it may be inverse compton scattering of cmb photons by lower energy electrons with the aid of strong relativistic beaming effect even on this large scale @xcite .    in this paper , assuming that x - ray emission is synchrotron radiation by high energy electrons we discuss the origin of the observed offsets and address the question why in all cases , knots at higher frequencies are located closer to the core than their counterparts at lower frequencies .",
    "@xcite suggested that time lags due to synchrotron losses can make these x - ray / optical and x - ray / radio offsets . in the shock acceleration scenario ,",
    "electrons in large scale jets can be accelerated to energies high enough to emit synchrotron x - rays .",
    "as they propagate downstream along the jet , electrons cool as they emit at progressively lower frequencies and result in radio / x - ray offsets at bright knots , e.g. , the centroids of x - ray knots should be observed closer to the core . in this case , however , we expect to see a time delay from high to low frequencies if cooling effect is the sole cause of the offsets . it is also noted that cooling time of radio emitting electrons is too long to explain the observed offset . in reality , x - ray / radio offsets are seen at the same time for distant observers and electron acceleration occurs for a finite time span and over a finite spatial extent .",
    "therefore , light travel time effects should be taken into account , too .",
    "this paper examines the possibility that x - ray / radio offsets can be explained by a single shock wave that accelerates electrons for a finite time span , by considering the energy dependent cooling timescale of relativistic electrons and light travel time effect of a relativistically moving source with a finite spatial extent . in  2 , we describe these effects and our model ,  3 and  4 present the results and discussion , respectively . finally ,  5",
    "summmarizes our conclusions .",
    "the light travel time effect is relevant when we consider relativistically moving sources which have a finite spatial extent , for example when a shock wave , or any kind of inhomogeneities , travels along the jet . in such cases ,",
    "emission from different positions in the jet at the same coordinate time reaches the observer at different time and will produce changes in the apparent shape of the brightness distribution as viewed from the observer . in other words , the apparent shape seen by",
    "the observer is different from the shape of the emission region at the same coordinate time .",
    "the difference is dependent on the viewing angle and the jet speed .",
    "first , we explain the simplest case shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : time_delay ] , i.e. , an infinitesimally thin rectilinear rod moving at a velocity of @xmath0 , normalized by the speed of light @xmath1 , viewed at a viewing angle @xmath2 .",
    "the emission region has a finite length from the point @xmath3 to @xmath4 .",
    "let the point d be located at the distance @xmath5 from the point a. the difference of arrival times at the observer between the radiation emitted from point a at the time @xmath6 and that from point d at the time @xmath7 is expressed as @xmath8 the condition of the same observer time @xmath9 gives the time difference of emission between the points a and d as @xmath10 when the relativistic beaming effect is significant ( @xmath11 ) , the time difference @xmath12 becomes larger than @xmath13 about by a factor of @xmath14 .",
    "moreover , the apparent distance between points a and d , @xmath15 , is @xmath16 this is also significantly larger than @xmath5 for relativistically beamed sources .",
    "it is noted that this effect is also important for unbeamed sources as far as the cooling time scale is shorter than @xmath12 in equation ( [ eq : timediff ] ) .",
    "interpretation of the jet structure should take into account this light travel time effect .",
    "in reality the thickness of the jet should be taken into account as is described in  2.3 .",
    "another important aspect is the effect of the finite cooling time of relativistic electrons .",
    "it is widely accepted that electrons are accelerated by shocks in the jet . in the framework of diffusive shock acceleration @xcite ,",
    "the time needed to accelerate electrons to a lorentz factor @xmath17 in the jet comoving frame is @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the shock speed , @xmath20 is the magnetic field strength , @xmath21 is the mean free path of electrons assumed to be proportional to the electron larmor radius with @xmath22 being a parameter ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 corresponds to the bhm limit ) , @xmath25 is the electron mass , and @xmath26 is the electron charge .",
    "this equation implies that only several thousand seconds are needed to accelerate electrons to the energy for which electrons emit synchrotron x - ray radiation in 1 mg magnetic field .",
    "the radiative cooling time @xmath27 of relativistic electrons through synchrotron radiation is @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the thomson cross section and @xmath30 is the energy density of the magnetic field .    in the jet comoving frame ,",
    "the typical synchrotron emission frequency of relativistic electrons , averaged over pitch angle , is @xmath31 where @xmath32 is larmor frequency . in terms of @xmath33 , equation ( [ eq : cooling timescale ] )",
    "can be expressed as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the typical synchrotron frequency in the observer frame and @xmath36^{-1}$ ] is the doppler factor .",
    "for example , the cooling time of high energy electrons emitting @xmath37hz photons and that of low energy ones emitting @xmath38ghz photons , differs by four orders of magnitude .",
    "thus , high energy electrons tend to be spatially confined near the shock front , while low energy electrons tend to be distributed in a more extended region .      to investigate the above two effects , as the simplest model we consider the emission from a shell with radius @xmath39 and width @xmath40 moving at a constant bulk lorentz factor @xmath41 and investigate the brightness distribution in the sky plane observed far from the jet with a viewing angle @xmath2 .",
    "hereafter , we adopt the cylindlical coordinate @xmath42 with @xmath43-axis being the direction of the bulk motion as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : shell ] .",
    "let us consider the time delay between two points a and b in the shell , the coordinates of which at time @xmath44 are given by @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "the point a represents the nearest position of the shell along the line of sight , while the point b represents an arbitrary position in the shell .",
    "we assume that at @xmath44 the shell begins to emit radiation and that the emission continues till @xmath47 . in this case , the time delay between the radiation emitted from the point b in the shell at the time @xmath48 ( the position designated by @xmath49 ) and the radiation emitted from the point a in the shell at the time @xmath50 ( the position designated by @xmath51 ) is @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the vector connecting the positions @xmath54 and @xmath55 and @xmath56 is the unit vector toward the observer along the line of sight . for definition of the plane of sky",
    ", we set the sky plane coordinates transverse to the line of sight as @xmath57 and set the unit vectors as @xmath58 and @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the unit vector along the @xmath43-axis . the origin @xmath61 on the x - y plane is taken as the position where the radiation emitted from the point @xmath62 at @xmath44 is observed .",
    "the point @xmath49 is observed at @xmath63 , where @xmath64    by calculating equations ( [ eq : location_x ] ) and ( [ eq : location_y ] ) under the condition @xmath9 , we determine the position and time of the point @xmath49 which is observed simultaneously with the point @xmath51 . considering the coordinates of point",
    "b take a range of @xmath65 , the brightness distribution on the plane of sky can be calculated .    in this paper , in order to demonstrate the effects of energy dependent radiative cooling we consider the simplest case where electrons have only two different energies .",
    "lower energy electrons have longer cooling time @xmath66 and higher energy electrons shorter one @xmath67 .",
    "moreover , we treat @xmath66 and @xmath67 as phenomenological parameters and simply assume that electrons radiate at a constant rate for the respective time spans .    as for the particle acceleration",
    ", we ignore the acceleration timescale and assume that electrons of all energy begin to emit synchrotron radiation at the same time @xmath44 , because the acceleration timescale is much shorter than the cooling timescales .",
    "of course , this model is just a toy model to demonstrate effects of light travel time and energy dependent radiative cooling . to improve on more realistic cases is not difficult once these effects are understood .",
    "owing to the energy dependent cooling , an offset between the brightness distributions of high and low frequency emission arises when the light travel time and cooling effects are taken into account . here , we discuss the typical magnitude expected in the two - dimensional plane containing the vector @xmath56 and @xmath69 , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:2d_shell ] . in the sky plane ,",
    "this plane is projected onto the line of @xmath70 const .",
    "we set the @xmath71-axis transverse to the @xmath43-axis to describe the position of the shell material and generarize the consideration made in section 2.1 to the shell with a finite thickness .",
    "since @xmath72 and @xmath73 , using equation ( [ eq : condition_t ] ) the condition of simultaneous observation @xmath74 gives the difference of the emission time for the points a and b , @xmath75 , as @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "so the maximum value of @xmath12 is expressed as @xmath79    the position and time of the point @xmath80 observed simultaneously with point @xmath51 at @xmath50 are given respectively by using the relation @xmath81 and @xmath82 as @xmath83 and @xmath84    the coordinates of @xmath85 and @xmath86 take a range of @xmath87 and @xmath88 , so the region observed simultaneously can be drawn by equation ( [ eq:2d_condi_02 ] ) as the grey - colored region in fig .",
    "[ fig:2d_shell ] for a given value of @xmath89 . in fig .",
    "[ fig:2d_shell ] , the radiating shell moves along the @xmath43-axis ( from left to right ) and both light and dark grey - colored regions represent the regions observed simultaneously .",
    "the region is segmented by a range of source time @xmath90 such that for more distant part along the line of sight the source time is earlier .",
    "the dark grey - colored region represents the region of high frequency radiation , while the light grey - colored region represents the region of low frequency radiation .",
    "it should be noted that in fig .",
    "[ fig:2d_shell ] we assume that the particle acceleration occurs instantaneously @xmath44 and synchrotron radiation begins at the time @xmath91 , and we set the time @xmath92 and the cooling timescales satisfy @xmath93 .",
    "the lines de , hi and c@xmath51 in fig .",
    "[ fig:2d_shell ] represent those of equal source time @xmath94 , respectively .",
    "so both the light and dark grey regions are observable at the low frequency while at the high frequency only the dark grey region is observed .    because we assume that the emissivity in the shell is independent of time as far as @xmath95 , the brightness on the plane of sky is simply proportional to the length of the emitting region along the line of sight",
    "then we can calculate the brightness distribution along the @xmath96-axis and see the offset between the brightness distributions between the high and low frequencies .",
    "the inclination of the hatched region is given by @xmath97 so that @xmath98 when @xmath99 and @xmath100 when @xmath101 .",
    "[ fig:2d_shell ] depicts the former case and the apparent size of the shell seen in the low frequency is given by @xmath102 for the latter case , it is also given by equation ( [ eq : delta_x ] ) .",
    "we notice the apparent size gives the upper limit on the offset .",
    "here we present the brightness distribution on the plane of sky at two frequencies corresponding to two energies of electrons .",
    "especially , the cases that the viewing angle is around @xmath103 are investigated .",

    "the solid line contours show the brightness distribution from the low energy electrons , while the gray - colored contour shows that from the high energy ones .",

    "the density of the gray contour shows the ratio of the brightness to its peak value . obviously , the offset between the centroid of the line contours and that of the gray - colored region is seen .",
    "the magnitude of the offset turns out to be @xmath113 for this case .",
    "the offset is not due to the beaming effect @xcite but the relativistic motion of jet . that is showed in fig .",
    "[ fig : result_3 ] where the velocity of jet is the same as that in fig .",

    "the difference is largely due to the difference in viewing angle .",
    "as has been noted in the previous section , the case @xmath124 the shell is seen from the tail side while for @xmath125 it is seen from the front side . as is seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : result_1 ] and [ fig : result_2 ] larger offset is expected when @xmath126 , while the offset is small when @xmath127 .",
    "[ fig : theta_var ] describes a closer inspection of the situation . as is seen in the former case , the brightness peak from the high energy electrons ( the position designated by @xmath128",
    "is located outside the flat top peak of the brightness contour from the low energy ones ( the segment desinated by @xmath129 ) , while for the latter case the position @xmath128 is inside the segment @xmath129 . for the both cases , it is noticed the offset between the position @xmath128 and @xmath130 , which represent the centroid of the brightness distribution from the low energy ones , exist .",
    "the brightness profile is also time - dependent . in fig .",
    "[ fig : time_var ] , the time variation of the brightness distribution on the plane of sky is shown for the case shown in fig . [",
    "fig : result_1 ] .",
    "the profiles of line contours and greyscale contours are shown in the same way as in fig .",
    "[ fig : result_1 ] , and all the brightness distributions are normalized by the peak values for each epoch .",
    "the epoch for panels @xmath131 is @xmath132 corresponding to @xmath133 , respectively . as is seen in panels @xmath134 and @xmath135 ,",
    "the offset is not significant for early stage before higher energy electrons cool .",
    "after high energy electrons have cooled , the offset arises and becomes larger with time as seen in panels @xmath136 . as a result , while the high energy radiation is observed for a time span of @xmath137 , offset is observed from @xmath138 to @xmath139 .",
    "thus , the offset is observed for about a half of the observing time of the high energy flux .",
    "moreover , the area covering the low frequency emission keeps increasing , but that of the high frequency emission first increases and reaches a maximum in panel @xmath135 and turns to decrease afterward .",
    "this time variation may be one of the reasons why the extent of the offsets is different in different knots , including the cases of no offset .",
    "after some time the shell emits only emission from lower energy electrons and seen only in the radio band .",
    "we have shown that the offset between x - rays and radio emission naturally arises when we take account of the energy dependent radiative cooling of relativistic elctrons and the light travel time effect for moving sources .",
    "we estimated that roughly half of the x - ray knots should show an offset from the radio knots .    in the above we adopted an artificially large ratio of the cooling time of x - ray emitting electrons to that of radio emitting electrons as 0.2 compared with the realistic value of around @xmath140 .",
    "this does not affect the above conclusion but affect the fraction in which x - ray knots are observed among radio knots .",
    "in the above we have assumed that particle acceleration is instantaneous but in reality particle acceleration occurs for a finite time span .",
    "the observability of x - ray knots is determined by the ratio of this time span to the cooling time of radio emitting electrons .",
    "in addition , adiabatic expansion of radio knots may play a role in determining the life time of radio knots .",
    "the ratio of the cooling time of radio emitting to the maximum time difference of emission time in the source @xmath141 is given by @xmath142 the order of magnitude of this value is of order unity , which is compatible with our model .",
    "now we discuss on the application of our model to the offsets seen in typical objects .",
    "first , we discuss on fri radio galaxies such as m 87 and cen a. although for fri radio galaxies viewing angle is relatively large and relativistic beaming effects are mild , the offset between x - ray and radio emission is expected as far as the knots are moving relativistically or even at mildly relativistic velocities . and",
    "its magnitude is a significant fraction of @xmath143 . as for m87 located at a distance of 16 mpc and @xmath144 ,",
    "the observed radio / x - ray offsets are found as @xmath145 for knot d and @xmath146 for knot f @xcite , while @xmath143 in our model is estimated as @xmath147 for @xmath148 , @xmath110 @xcite , @xmath149 corresponding to @xmath150 and @xmath109 . for @xmath151 @xcite and @xmath39 satisfies equation ( [ eq : condition_r ] ) which means high energy electrons cool sufficiently fast .",
    "it is interesting to note that the x - ray knots d and f are not separated from the radio knots but a part of the radio knots , which is fully consistent with our results shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : result_1 ] and [ fig : result_2 ] .",
    "thus , our model is compatible with observations of m87 .    in cen",
    "a located at a distance of @xmath152 and @xmath153 , the radio / x - ray offsets increase from @xmath154 for knots a2a / ax2 to @xmath155 for knots a3b / ax3a and @xmath156 for b1a / bx2 @xcite .",
    "this feature is probably due to the increase of the jet radius @xmath39 with the distance from the nucleus and we set @xmath157 @xcite for respective knots corresponding to @xmath158 .",
    "these radii satisfies the cooling condition of equation ( [ eq : condition_r ] ) .",
    "it should be noticed the viewing angle and velocity of the jet in cen a are not well determined only with the constraints of @xmath159 and @xmath160 @xcite .",
    "thus , we examine two sets of parameters .",
    "first we set a large vieing angle and relativistic velocity such as @xmath161 , @xmath110 , @xmath162 and @xmath118 .",
    "for this set we obtain @xmath143 of @xmath163 for respective knots .",
    "( the differences of @xmath143 come from those of @xmath39 . )",
    "second choise is a moderate viewing angle and moderate velocity such as @xmath164 , @xmath165 , @xmath162 and @xmath118 .",
    "for this case we obtain @xmath143 of @xmath166 for respective knots and these are smaller than the observations .",
    "thus , the first case of larger viewing angle and faster velocity of jet are prefered .",
    "finally , we discuss on offsets of quasar jet in pks 1127 - 145 which located at @xmath167 and @xmath168 corresponds to @xmath169 @xcite .",
    "the largescale radio / x - ray offsets are found as @xmath170 for knot a , @xmath171 for knot b and @xmath172 for knot c @xcite .",
    "the jet radius @xmath39 is around @xmath173 for every konts @xcite and satisfies equation ( [ eq : condition_r ] ) for @xmath174 .",
    "however , the viewing angle and velocity of the jet are not well known yet @xcite so we examine parameters which meet the condition @xmath175 by equation ( [ eq : delta_x ] ) . consequently we find when @xmath176 or @xmath177 or @xmath178 the magnitudes of the offsets are comptible with our model",
    "however , x - ray emission mechanism in these sources is still an open problem because the x - ray spectrum is definitely flatter than the extrapolation of radio to optical spectrum @xcite . in spite of this complexities",
    ", the offset may suggest that x - rays are from high energy electrons with short cooling time .",
    "we investigated apparent internal structure of kiloparsec scale jets of agns arising from the energy dependent cooling of accelerated electrons and light travel time effect for relativistically moving sources . using a simple cylindrical shell model ,",
    "we find that the offsets between the peaks of x - ray , optical and radio brightness distributions observed for many cases are basically explained . assuming that electrons in the moving shell are instantaneously accelerated , x - rays are emitted for a shorter time scale and observed at the side nearer to the nucleus , while radio emission continues to the far side of the nucleus because of longer cooling time .",
    "the resultant offset in fig .",
    "[ fig : result_1 ] turns out to be order of the jet diameter owing to the light travel time effect .",
