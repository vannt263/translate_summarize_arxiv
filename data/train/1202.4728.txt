    "the phoenix dwarf galaxy was discovered in 1976 by @xcite who described it as a very distant ( @xmath0100  kpc ) globular cluster .",
    "it was later identified as a dwarf irregular galaxy ( dirr ) by @xcite .",
    "these galaxies are hi rich and show obvious signs of recent star formation . despite this classification , phoenix has characteristics of a dwarf spheroid galaxy ( dsph ) and it has been suggested that it belongs to an intermediate class of galaxy between the dwarf spheroidal and dwarf irregular , along with three other dwarf galaxies ( pegasus , pisces ( lgs3 ) and antila ) .",
    "the distance to phoenix has been determined to be @xmath0420  kpc using a variety of different methods and data sets ( for example see @xcite and , more recently , @xcite ) placing phoenix well within the local group .",
    "the hi gas surrounding phoenix was mapped by young et al .",
    "@xcite using the vla .",
    "they identify several regions in the immediate vicinity with a variety of shapes and velocities .",
    "one such cloud , located @xmath05south west of the main stellar body , has been unequivocally associated with phoenix based on the excellent agreement of the radial velocities of the stars , obtained from stellar spectra @xcite from the vlt , and the velocity of the hi cloud .",
    "@xcite recognise that this offset suggests that phoenix could offer a unique opportunity to study the possible mechanisms responsible for gas removal in dwarf galaxies , transforming a gas - rich dirr into a gas - poor dsph .    extensive optical data of the central region of phoenix also exists : the wide field planetary camera ( wfpc2 ) onboard _ hst _ has imaged the central field of the galaxy with both f814w and f555w filters ( for example see @xcite and @xcite , hereafter h09 ) .",
    "@xcite use both of these data sets to derive separate star formation histories for the eastern and western sides of phoenix .",
    "they report an asymmetry in the star formation rate across the face of the galaxy , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "the western side of phoenix displays evidence for strong episodes of star formation at 180 and 40  myr ago whilst the eastern side shows evidence for more continual star formation from 250 to 50  myr ago .",
    "they note that this is consistent with the hi location , offset to the west of the galaxy s optical emission .",
    "these epochs of star formation are similar to those for another dirr galaxy : the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) .",
    "@xcite report that the smc had `` bursts '' of star formation at 2.5 , 0.4 and 0.06  gyr in the past .",
    "in fact , the phoenix dwarf galaxy shares many other common features with the smc , including its low metallicity ( z=0.004 for the smc , @xcite ; z=0.0015 for phoenix , h09 ) .",
    "the smc is @xmath0100 times as massive as phoenix and host to an unusually high number of high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) @xcite .",
    "these are stellar systems in which a compact object , usually a neutron star , accretes material from a more massive donor - either a supergiant or early - type star , both of ob class .",
    "supergiant systems are a persistent source of x - rays with luminosities , @xmath2 , @xmath3@xmath4 ergs  s@xmath5 .",
    "be / x - ray binary systems have two types of outburst associated with their x - ray emission .",
    "type i outbursts have l@xmath6 in the range @xmath3-@xmath7 ergs  s@xmath5 and occur periodically , around the time of the periastron passage of the neutron star , type ii outbursts reach higher luminosities , l@xmath8 ergs  s@xmath5 and show no correlation with orbital phase @xcite .",
    "a comparison with the milky way suggests we see a factor of @xmath050 more hmxbs in the smc than we would expect to observe , based on the mass ratio of the two galaxies .",
    "the stellar winds of massive stars are known to be line driven @xcite and so a lower metallicity will lead to less mass being lost from the compact object progenitor .",
    "this in turn is expected to affect the number of systems that survive the initial supernova explosionand go on to form hmxbs .",
    "@xcite use simulations to demonstrate that this is indeed the case but are unable to replicate the the number and period distribution of the smc hmxbs with a low metallicity environment alone .",
    "it has been known for some time that hmxbs are strong tracers of recent star formation episodes in a galaxy .",
    "it is currently thought that an increase in star formation , possibly caused by tidal interactions with the milky way and/or the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) @xcite along with the low metallicity of the smc have given rise to the large number of hmxbs in the smc .",
    "@xcite ( 2003 , hereafter g03 ) have quantified this relationship for sources with x - ray luminosities in excess of @xmath4  ergs  s@xmath5 .",
    "however be / x - ray binaries , which are the most numerous subclass of hmxb @xcite , do not reach these luminosities .",
    "one of the reasons for choosing such a high threshold luminosity was to avoid contamination from any low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) present in any of the galaxies studied .",
    "@xcite has shown that the number of low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) scales linearly with the mass of the host galaxy , therefore the low mass local group dwarf galaxies like phoenix ( @xmath9  m@xmath10 , @xcite ) which are too low mass to expect lmxbs are ideal for probing the hmxb ",
    "star formation relation in the low luminosity limit . by studying any population",
    "present we hope to further understand factors that can influence star formation in such diverse environments .",
    "predicting the number of hmxbs can not be done with great accuracy as the effects of all the influencing parameters are not fully understood .",
    "if we assume that the logn - logs relationship reported by g03 for hmxbs remains valid down to x - ray luminosities of @xmath11  ergs  s@xmath5 , the typical luminosity of the lower type i outbursts seen in the smc @xcite , equation ( 7 ) of g03 and the average star formation rate ( sfr ) of phoenix ( @xmath12  m@xmath10  yr@xmath5 , calculated from data in h09 ) predicts 0.14@xmath130.02 .",
    "however , this apparently precise number could be significantly affected by many factors including the metallicity values .",
    "the same equation predicts @xmath020 x - ray sources with @xmath14  ergs  s@xmath5 ( adopting the same value for the sfr as g03 , 0.15  m@xmath10  yr@xmath5 , taken from @xcite ) for the smc .",
    "we currently know of @xmath060 hmxbs in the smc@xcite , of which @xmath050 are x - ray pulsars , and more are being discovered every year ( e.g. sxp1062 , @xcite ) .",
    "using a sfr of 0.2  m@xmath10  yr@xmath5 for the lmc @xcite leads to a predictions of @xmath030 sources in the lmc with this luminosity constraint .",
    "there are currently 36 known hmxbs in the lmc , including several supergiant systems and black hole candidates .",
    "the reason behind the apparent discrepancy in the smc could lie with both the activity cycles of these hmxbs and the details of their star formation histories .",
    "the number of hmxbs in a galaxy will be more strongly linked to the recent star formation episodes , rather than the average star formation of the galaxy over its lifetime .",
    "the sfr of the more recent episodes of star formation ( 40 - 60  myr ago ) in phoenix and the smc are very similar .",
    "the smc varies from @xmath15 to @xmath16  m@xmath10  yr@xmath5arcmin@xmath17 @xcite depending on the area of the smc , whilst the most recent epoch of star formation in phoenix had a sfr of @xmath18  m@xmath10  yr@xmath5arcmin@xmath17 @xcite .",
    "it is only by probing galaxies across a broad spectrum of mass , star formation history , and chemical composition that we can establish both trends in the hmxb populations of these galaxies and understand the significance of these objects as tracers of star formation .",
