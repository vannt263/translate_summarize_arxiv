    "<S> we provide a straightforward demonstration of a fundamental difference between classical and quantum mechanics for a single local system ; namely the absence of a joint probability distribution of the position @xmath0 and momentum @xmath1 . elaborating on a recently reported criterion by bednorz and belzig [ phys . </S>",
    "<S> rev . </S>",
    "<S> a * 83 * , 52113 ] we derive a simple criterion that must be fulfilled for any joint probability distribution in classical physics . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the violation of this criterion using homodyne measurement of a single photon state , thus proving a straightforward signature of the breakdown of a classical description of the underlying state . </S>",
    "<S> most importantly , the criterion used does not rely on quantum mechanics and can thus be used to demonstrate non - classicality of systems not immediately apparent to exhibit quantum behavior . </S>",
    "<S> the criterion is directly applicable any system described by the continuous canonical variables x and p , such as a mechanical or an electrical oscillator and a collective spin of a large ensemble .    </S>",
    "<S> the conceptual differences between classical and quantum physics have intrigued and sometimes bewildered the physics community since the early days of quantum mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> this has led to a search for indisputable manifestations of the quantum world through observations of non - classical behavior in experiments . </S>",
    "<S> a field of particular curiosity is that of identifying the quantum to classical cross - over for ever larger systems , thereby eventually identifying non - classical effects in macroscopic systems . </S>",
    "<S> recently this has led to the observation of , e.g. , macroscopic entangled atomic ensembles @xcite , interference of large molecules @xcite and experiments pushing toward observing non - classical effects in mechanical oscillators @xcite . in parallel to this fundamental interest , non - classicality is of central importance to quantum information processing , the essence of which is to advance computation beyond what is classically possible @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , in some instances quantum effects are claimed by demonstrating consistency with an appropriate quantum model . yet </S>",
    "<S> any rigorous demonstration of genuine quantum behavior must exclude the possibility of classical explanations . </S>",
    "<S> the importance of this is exemplified in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where a pair of coupled classical oscillators is shown to exhibit signatures easily mistaken for those of entanglement expected from a quantum model . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a definite conclusion on the quantum nature of a system can only result from the breakdown of the classical description and not from verified agreement with quantum mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> this approach is most rigorously demonstrated by the bell - inequalities , where the underlying model of the system is stripped of any physics and is reduced to the very basic assumptions of locality and realism , resulting in an indisputable non - classicality criterion . </S>",
    "<S> the bell - inequalities can not however , by their very nature , be investigated by data obtained from a single system .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we provide a conceptually simple demonstration of one of the key discrepancies between classical and quantum mechanics , valid for systems of a single degree of freedom : classical systems can always be described by a joint probability distribution for @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the two canonically conjugated coordinates of a system , whereas such a description does not apply in quantum mechanics due to the heisenberg uncertainty principle . </S>",
    "<S> this discrepancy is most evident when the phase space description of the state of a system is examined . </S>",
    "<S> classically , the phase space distribution @xmath2 is the joint probability of finding the system in an infinitesimal area around @xmath3 , and hence it obeys all the requirements of a probability distribution including being a non - negative function . as mentioned , in the case of a quantum phase space formulation , introduced by wigner @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the heisenberg uncertainty renders this definition meaningless , as a joint probability distribution for @xmath0 and @xmath1 does not exist . </S>",
    "<S> the phase space distribution is only defined through the single coordinate ( marginal ) distributions , projected from the distribution function @xcite and this relaxation of constraints allows for negative values of the function in areas smaller than @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> this negativity is not directly observable due to the vacuum fluctuations preventing simultaneous measurement of @xmath0 and @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> however , one can still infer the phase space distribution from measurements of only a single observable at a time and detect such negativities , thereby illuminating the failure of classical theory .    </S>",
    "<S> the usage of these negativities as markers of non - classicality has been discussed and demonstrated in several quantum optics systems ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , using tomographic techniques . </S>",
    "<S> often such methods search for the quantum state most compatible with the experimental data using statistical inference or variational techniques@xcite and thus inherently rely on quantum mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> these methods are therefore not applicable for demonstrating the absence of a classical description </S>",
    "<S> . alternatively , given measurements of all the coordinate distributions , the underlying state can be uniquely determined , and the phase space distribution fully calculated using the inverse radon transformation @xcite without relying on quantum mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> though such methods have been used in quantum optics for demonstrating various states , the mathematical transformation involved is highly complicated . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore the numerical stability of the inverse transformation is problematic , leading to numerical uncertainty at high frequencies , and sometimes results in unphysical states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these limitations are a drawback for using tomographic techniques for validating the breakdown of a classical description , and the application of these methods is usually cumbersome .    </S>",
    "<S> our simple , unambiguous demonstration of the absence of a classical probability distribution is based on recent theoretical work by bednorz and belzig @xcite that verifies the negativity of the wigner function based on moments . as discussed in detail below , </S>",
    "<S> their results lead to a hierarchy of inequalities , such that violation of any one inequality indicates negativity of the wigner function . full tomographic reconstruction with the associated numerical complexities is thereby avoided . </S>",
    "<S> we extend this approach such that it can be applied to quadrature measurement of a single photon state , and use the experimental data from the heralded single photon generation to directly disprove the existence of a joint probability of the position and momentum for this system .    </S>",
    "<S> we start by re - iterating the key results of bednorz and belzig , through a reformulation that relies only on classical mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> the phase space of a system with a single degree of freedom is fully characterized by a two - dimensional phase space distribution @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> that is , given the phase space distribution , the ensemble averaged result of any measurable quantity @xmath6 can be obtained by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the decomposition of the quantity @xmath6 in terms of the generalized coordinate @xmath0 and its canonically conjugated momentum @xmath1 .    to disprove the existence of a classical probability distribution we examine the ensemble average of a non - negative test function @xmath9 over a classically explainable system , which must have a proper distribution function that results in the ensemble average of @xmath10 be non - negative : </S>",
    "<S> @xmath11 violating this condition is a direct proof of the absence of a joint probability distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the condition can , however , be violated in quantum mechanics , where @xmath5 is the wigner function that can contain negative values . </S>",
    "<S> the objective therefore is to optimize a test function such that it will be dominant at the possible negative areas of the distribution function . for a rotationally invariant phase space both the phase space distribution and the test function </S>",
    "<S> can be described solely by the phase space radius @xmath12 , defined by @xmath13 . for reasons to become clear later </S>",
    "<S> , we choose a specific form for the test function @xmath10 , writing it as a square of an @xmath14th order , even polynomial @xmath15 with real coefficients @xmath16 ; @xmath17 minimizing the above expression for a given order @xmath14 is done by straight - forward linear optimization of the coefficients @xmath16 : @xmath18 for all @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> notice that the linearity of the problem ensures that the obtained minimum of @xmath20 is global and therefore the most optimal indicator of a possible violation of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : require ] ) for a given polynomial order @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to emphasize that this is only a sufficient criterion for non - classicality , and an optimized positive average for a chosen @xmath14 does not ensure a classical probability distribution , since the negativity may only be exhibited by the inclusion of higher order terms in @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is clear that increasing the polynomial order @xmath14 can not increase the minimized value of @xmath20 , and we conjecture that the limit of @xmath21 will exhibit any negativity of the wigner function , as the polynomial can represent an arbitrarily ( analytical ) sharp peaked function @xmath10 focused at the negativity . </S>",
    "<S> assuming the existence of all moments ( e.g. , due to an exponentially decaying tail of the phase space distribution at large @xmath12 ) , this then becomes a necessary criterion for the negativity of the distribution function . </S>",
    "<S> we also note here , that similar polynomial expansion has been discussed @xcite in the context of the p - function distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the p - function is , however , only defined within the framework of quantum mechanics , and hence can not be used to prove the absence of a classical description .    </S>",
    "<S> we assume that , as is the case for many systems , the system in question can only be experimentally accessed by measuring one of the canonically conjugated variables ( e.g. , @xmath0 or @xmath1 ) at a time . </S>",
    "<S> since we are restricted to single coordinate measurement at a time , neither the intensity nor the phase space distribution function is directly accessible . </S>",
    "<S> for this method to be applicable to such experimental data , the functional @xmath22 must be expressed in terms of the moments of the projected coordinates @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is a measureable rotated coordinate . </S>",
    "<S> to do this we use the identity @xmath25 where @xmath26 this is where quantum and classical approaches diverge . while classically eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : mathidentity ] ) represents a measurable physical quantity , it is missing the key vacuum uncertainty , allowing for the breakdown of the classical description .    </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note the implication of identity ( [ eq : mathidentity ] ) . for the @xmath27th moment of the radial distribution to be known , </S>",
    "<S> we need @xmath27 cuts in phase space ; i.e. , different coordinate measurements at equally distributed angles . </S>",
    "<S> regardless of any assumption about the underlying state , the average of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : mathidentity ] ) directly gives @xmath28 in the special case of a symmetric distribution function these moments are all identical , and eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : moments ] ) reduces to @xmath29 the radial moments can thus be indirectly calculated from the quadrature measurements . </S>",
    "<S> substituting these radial moments into eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : require ] ) using the functional form of @xmath9 given by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : functional ] ) , we get , for a given set of measured moments @xmath30 , a necessary condition for classicality of the underlying state . if eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : require ] ) is violated by the solutions of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : optimazation ] ) , the underlying state can not be explained by a proper phase space probability distribution , and one can not assign a joint probability distribution to @xmath0 and @xmath1 .    to demonstrate the absence of a joint probability distribution we are going to consider the phase space description of a single photon state . in phase space </S>",
    "<S> this can be described by the first excited state of a harmonic oscillator , which is rotationally invariant and contain negative parts in the wigner functions . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : epsart2 ] shows the optimal functional forms obtained for the this state for low polynomial orders . as higher order terms </S>",
    "<S> are included , the optimized test function is increasingly probing the negative part of @xmath31 , yielding a negative expectation value .     </S>",
    "<S> profiles of the test function @xmath10 minimizing the expectation value @xmath20 for the first excited state of a quantum harmonic oscillator , as a function of the phase space radius , for different orders @xmath14 ( see text ) plotted against the profile of the corresponding wigner function . as the order of the polynomial increases , the function becomes centered around the negativity , decreasing elsewhere . in this case , </S>",
    "<S> negative expectation values are obtained starting at @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> inset shows the polynomial order required to observe negative expectation values , as a function of the single - photon fractional content in a mixture with vacuum . as the fraction of vacuum </S>",
    "<S> is increased , the state approaches a classically describable state and higher moments are needed to observe the negativity . ]    </S>",
    "<S> we note that negative expectation values appear only from the fourth order onward . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the peak of the test function at the position of the negativity must be narrower than heisenberg s uncertainty in order not to smear the negativity ; this is in full agreement with ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the experimental demonstration is achieved with single photons generated by an heralded cavity - enhanced non - degenerate parametric down - conversion . </S>",
    "<S> the equivalence between a single mode electromagnetic field and an harmonic oscillator allows us to describe the em field by a phase space of a single degree of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> the down - conversion process produces two photons , and as one is detected as a trigger , the result is a single photon state where the losses introduce a statistically mixed component of vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> the projection measurements ( quadratures ) are obtained by measuring the statistics of the noise , using an optical homodyne detection scheme . in this scheme , </S>",
    "<S> the weak investigated optical field is overlapped with a strong laser pulse on a beam splitter , and the interference of the two fields is detected and subtracted . </S>",
    "<S> the phase of the strong laser field determines the angle @xmath33 ( eq .  ( [ eq : quadratures ] ) ) of the measured coordinate . </S>",
    "<S> measurements were taken without fixing the phase of the local oscillator , thus smearing the resulting distribution . </S>",
    "<S> this enables us to treat the results as rotationally invariant even if non - invariant features existed prior to smearing . </S>",
    "<S> such measurements will generate a rotationally invariant reconstructed state for any underlying state , but this does not necessarily average out negativities in the wigner function ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> for details of the experimental setup and the charactarization of the resulting single photon see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    the data set contained 180,000 measured quadratures . </S>",
    "<S> we have here revised the optimization of the functional to also account for statistical uncertainties inherent to a limited data set . </S>",
    "<S> this is done by optimizing @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the standard deviation of @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the results are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : epsart ] . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the expectation value for our test function is negative with certainty of almost twenty standard deviations , clearly demonstrates that the measured state in this experiment can not be explained by classical theory , unambiguously negating the possibility of existence of a joint probability distribution for @xmath0 and @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the appearance of negative values from the twelfth order polynomials and higher indicate the quantum mechanical description of this state in terms of a wigner function includes negative valued areas . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the minimized function from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : functional ] ) is monotonically decreasing for increasing order @xmath14 , and the onset of negativity at a certain order therefore means that all higher orders will also be negative . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests a sequential authentication procedure for an unknown state . </S>",
    "<S> as mentioned above , for a pure single photon state , negative expectation values are observable from the @xmath36-th order polynomial onwards . </S>",
    "<S> the twelfth order polynomial required here is due to the vacuum component of the field , requiring higher orders of the polynomial as shown in the inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : epsart ] , and is in agreement with the results obtained in ref .  @xcite reporting 62% fraction of single photon in the resulting mixed state .     </S>",
    "<S> expectation value for the square of a polynomial relative to its standard deviation , as a function of the polynomial s order for the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> negativity by almost @xmath37 standard deviations disproves the existence of a joint probability distribution for @xmath0 and @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the inset shows a histogram of the raw measured quadrature data ( arbitrary units ) . ]    in conclusion , we have experimentally demonstrated the non - existence of a joint probability distribution of two canonical variables . </S>",
    "<S> this is done by violation of an inequality derived without the assumptions of quantum mechanics , thus allowing for it as proof of the absence of a classical description in systems not immediately evident to display quantum behavior . </S>",
    "<S> the procedure used here can thus provide a simple , practical tool for demonstrating the non - classicality of a state based on quadrature measurements , where the existence of a classical joint distribution of two conjugated variables can be negated . in this way , </S>",
    "<S> this procedure is closely linked to other criteria @xcite demonstrating contextuality of measurements , and thus disproving the classical local hidden variable view . unlike ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , which are applicable to discrete variables , the method demonstrated here applies for continuous variables such as position and momentum , collective spin operators @xcite and quadrature phase operators . </S>",
    "<S> this makes it useful to systems containing many particles , where criteria based on counting particles are not easily implemented and interpreted . </S>",
    "<S> this method complements the full tomographic reconstruction techniques in that it is simpler and avoids numerical complexities of inverse transformations . </S>",
    "<S> these kinds of conceptual proofs , when extended to different detection schemes , can shed more light on the quantum to classical correspondence , especially where the control of claimed macroscopic quantum states is in question . </S>"
