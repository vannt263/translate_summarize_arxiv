    "the conclusions and some ideas for the future are given in  9 .",
    "a suitable target cloud should fulfill certain criteria .",
    "its distance has to be known in order to match integration times to the faintest stars at the cloud s edge .",
    "it has to be sufficiently opaque ( @xmath21 mag ) to screen out the vast majority of background stars and galaxies .",
    "the high extinction areas must be large enough to provide a reasonable number of foreground stars .",
    "it is also desirable to avoid the immediate neighbourhood of star - forming regions , since young overluminous stars within , or just in front of , the cloud may be mistaken as nearby older field m dwarfs .",
    "the final selection includes the following cloud complexes , orion a ( southern part of l1641 , 480 pc , @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) , serpens ( @xmath24 south from the serpens cloud core , 200250 pc , @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) and two separate areas in @xmath0 oph ( l1688 and l1689 , 160 pc , @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) .",
    "cloud distances for the original selection were taken from hilton & lahulla ( @xcite ) .",
    "the photometric distances and the total number of m dwarfs in front of orion a indicate a distance of 400 rather than 480 pc .",
    "this result is consistent with the 390 pc in anthony  twarog ( @xcite ) , derived from a subsample in the warren & hesser ( @xcite ) catalogue of stars associated with the orion complex . in order to confirm this finding , the hipparcos catalogue ( esa @xcite )",

    "eleven of the stars that were assigned a high probability to be associated with the @xmath0 oph complex by elias ( @xcite ) were identified in the hipparcos catalogue and show a sharp peak at 150 pc .",

    "note that these clouds are extended irregular objects far from being sheet - like or spherical .",
    "the distances above were derived from observations of optically visible stars , and therefore mainly probe the front edge of the cloud , which though is sufficient for the purpose of this paper .",

    "the transformations to the johnson @xmath31 and kron - cousins @xmath32 systems were based on standard stars selected from landolt ( @xcite ) .",
    "since the observations were aimed at m dwarfs in the first place , care was taken to include the reddest dwarf stars in this list , g45 - 20 ( @xmath33 ) , g156 - 31 ( @xmath34 ) , g12 - 43 ( @xmath35 ) , g10 - 50 ( @xmath36 ) and g44 - 40 ( @xmath37 ) .",

    "standard reductions were carried out with iraf .",
    "it was not possible to apply a meaningful flux calibration , since the targets were always at airmasses between 2 and 3.5 , leading to a substantial loss of light in the blue end of the spectra .",
    "since this survey was designed for detecting m dwarfs , the original @xmath40 exposure times were set rather short .",

    ". this will not be the case in this survey , since the foreground sample is strictly volume limited and there is a dark cloud preventing distant stars from interfering .",
    "the number of lost companions was estimated from the binary distribution in the nearby stars in rg97 .",
    "after applying the correction for galactic structure 10 companions were expected to have been lost .",
    "these were distributed as the lost binary companions in fig .",

    "[ figlf ] and table  [ tablf ] .",
    "the sample of wds is too small to derive any details in the wd lf .",
    "seven wds were found , 0.015 ( @xmath44)pc@xmath7 ( poissonian errors ) , which is a significantly higher number than expected from ldm88 ( 0.003pc@xmath7 ) , but in better agreement with rt95 and oswalt et al .",

    "these numbers will be dicussed in more detail in sect .",
    "[ wddiscuss ] .",
    "for the m - dwarf part , the agreement with other photometric surveys is satisfactory ( fig .  [ figlf ] ) .",
    "it is clear that any contamination of the m - dwarf sample from background stars and/or stars associated with the clouds must be small and that the opaque - nebula method works reliably also in a purely photometric version , provided that the photometry is sufficiently accurate .",
    "the main advantage in comparison to other methods is that the survey volume does not rely on photometric parallaxes .",
    "even though the individual absolute magnitudes do suffer from cosmic spread in the colour - magnitude relation , each star s contribution to the space density does not .",
    "if the distance to the cloud is not known a priori , it can either be estimated from the photometric distances of the foreground objects or by their integrated number in a well - known part of the lf . in this context",
    "it would be useful to obtain more data for foreground stars brightwards of the peak in the lf at @xmath46 .",
    "the derived samples are volume limited and unaffected by dynamical bias . finally , the dark clouds effectively screen background galaxies and giant stars from the foreground population",
    ".    among the drawbacks are that the selected foreground objects in general will be too distant for binaries to be resolved and therefore the derived lf must be corrected for by an a priori known binary distribution function .",
    "the dark clouds are not evenly spread across the sky , which means that the available areas are restricted . on the other hand",
    ", they do provide a tool for probing areas near the milky way plane .",
    "we compare our result with that of jdh94 .",
    "the generalized volume sampled in that paper is 52 pc@xmath1 ( @xmath0 oph ) + 101 pc@xmath1 ( taurus ) , totally 153 pc@xmath1 .",
    "a striking difference as compared to our survey is their excess of late foreground candidates , seen also in the barnard5 survey ( jarrett @xcite ) .",
    "the comparison here was made in @xmath0 oph e , where part of our surveys overlap .",
    "five of their six foreground candidates that were cross identified lie perfectly on the reddening sequence in our data and are definitely not foreground objects ( fig .  [ figjarrett ] ) .",
    "since our data for the bright j43 are consistent , the photometric calibration is likely to be correct .",
    "a possible explanation of the colour discrepancy is that these sources were spread into the jdh94 foreground sample as a result of their lower signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "our data reach @xmath19 2 magnitudes deeper than jdh94 .",
    "it may also be that the jdh94 photometry is subject to systematically discrepant corrections for atmospheric correction , since their data were acquired at high air masses ( @xmath47 , jarrett , priv comm . ) .",
    "the tendency that very faint stars , barely measurable , scatter into the m - dwarf zone is seen also in our data , and was the main reason for including objects only to the completeness limit and not all the way down to the detection limit of the survey , about 1 mag fainter .      a local number density of 0.015 ( @xmath48 ) wdspc@xmath7 was derived from the 7 wds discovered in this survey .",
    "this is a factor 5 more than predicted from ldm88 .",
    "rt95 found 0.008 ( @xmath49 ) wdspc@xmath7 in a proper motion survey , consistent with our result , but as in our case the numbers are small .",
    "an interesting result is that ruiz et al .",
    "( @xcite ) found a factor 2 more stars with @xmath50yr@xmath51 than present in _",
    "( luyten @xcite ) for overlapping areas .",
    "the ldm88 sample was drawn from _",
    "lhs _ and would also be affected by this proposed incompleteness , a fact that may explain the discrepancy in the ldm88 wd density as compared to more recent results .",
    "oswalt et al .",
    "( @xcite ) used yet another approach and arrived at @xmath52 wdspc@xmath7 for wds in wide binaries .",
    "they added the single - wd lf in ldm88 ( 0.0023 wdspc@xmath7 ) and concluded that the total space density of wds in the solar neighbourhood is @xmath53 wdspc@xmath7 .",
    "our results and rt95 show that the ldm88 sample is likely to suffer from a rather large incompleteness , suggesting that adding 0.0023 wdspc@xmath7 to the binary part results in a substantial underestimation of the total wd space density .",
    "our sample of wds includes neither wide nor narrow binaries , except possible double wds .",
    "if we add our wd density to the oswalt binaries the result is 0.02 ( @xmath54 ) wdspc@xmath7 , corresponding to 0.013 ( @xmath5)m@xmath6pc@xmath7 if we assume a mean mass of 0.65m@xmath6 per wd",
    ". the wd fraction of the dynamical mass would then be 17 ( @xmath55)% . objects like eso 439 - 20 ( rt95 ) and wd 0346 + 246 ( hambly et al .",
    "@xcite ) suggest that the wd density may be even larger .",
    "the results of the macho micro lensing experiment ( alcock et al .",
    "@xcite ) have given a mean mass of the lensing objects of @xmath190.5 m@xmath6 , although strongly model dependent .",
    "the macho mass density in the solar neighbourhood is on the order of 0.005 m@xmath6pc@xmath7 , which in fact is consistent with the proposed increase of the wd space density .",
    "however , more definite results will have to await a larger volume limited sample of wds .",
    "the space density of m dwarfs and wds has been studied as volume limited samples in front of dark high extinction nebulae , a method that efficiently reduces the impact of malmquist bias , since the survey is volume limited and the lf not dependening on individual photometric distance estimates .",
    "areas towards the molecular cloud complexes @xmath0 oph , serpens and orion a were observed .",
    "the survey covers a volume corresponding to 464 pc@xmath1 in the solar neighbourhood , complete to @xmath2 . in total 21 m dwarfs and 7 wds",
    "were identified as foreground objects .",
    "although details are hard to resolve due to the limited sample , our m - dwarf lf is consistent with previous photometric results , and after binary correction also with the nearby stars .",
    "our survey does not show any signs of the reported upturn in the faintest magnitude bins in the previous dark cloud surveys ( jarrett @xcite,@xcite ; jarrett et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and we conclude that their excess of faint m dwarfs is probably caused by their larger photometric errors .",
    "the unexpected appearance of as many as 7 wds compared to the 1.4 estimated from the wd space density in ldm88 is perhaps the most interesting result of this paper .",
    "the derived space density is 0.015 ( @xmath48 ) wdspc@xmath7 . by combining our sample with the binary wds in oswalt et al .",
    "( @xcite ) the final estimate is 0.02 ( @xmath54 ) wdspc@xmath7 , implying a mass density of 0.013 ( @xmath5 ) m@xmath6pc@xmath7 .",
    "this means that the wds may contribute by as much as 1520% to the local dynamical mass .",
    "no doubt this subject is not yet settled and deserves further investigation . + the method of opaque nebulae",
    "has indeed proved to be efficient in identifying foreground m dwarfs and wds .",
    "concerning the latter , any nebula that provides a colour excess @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) ensures that also the bluest main sequence stars get a reddened colour beyond the reddest known wds ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "already for orion a the available area is @xmath59 times larger than our field , enclosing a volume that would host @xmath19150 wds and @xmath19550 m dwarfs , numbers that certainly are sufficient for a more detailed analysis of the corresponding lfs .",
    "the increased availability of large field ccds and ccd mosaics provides the ideal tools for this kind of survey .",
    "we have also shown that the distance to the clouds and the cloud extinction may be reliably derived from the @xmath3 data alone , an important point if a future large - scale survey of this kind is to be carried out .",
