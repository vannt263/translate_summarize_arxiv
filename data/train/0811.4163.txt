    "due to its vector - space preserving property , random linear network coding @xcite can be viewed as transmitting subspaces over an operator channel @xcite . as such , error control for random linear network coding",
    "can be modeled as a coding problem , where codewords are subspaces and the distance is measured by either the subspace distance @xcite or the injection metric @xcite .",
    "codes in the projective space , referred to as subspace codes henceforth , and codes in the grassmannian , referred to as constant - dimension codes ( cdcs ) henceforth , have been both investigated for error control in random linear network coding .",
    "using cdcs is sometimes advantageous since the fixed dimension of cdcs simplifies the network protocol somewhat @xcite .",
    "the construction and properties of cdcs thus have attracted a lot of attention .",
    "different constructions of cdcs have been proposed @xcite .",
    "bounds on cdcs based on packing properties are investigated ( see , for example , @xcite ) , and the covering properties of cdcs are investigated in @xcite .",
    "the construction and properties of subspace codes have received less consideration , and previous works on subspace codes ( see , for example , @xcite ) have focused on the packing properties . in @xcite , bounds on the maximum cardinality of a subspace code with the subspace metric , notably the counterpart of the gilbert bound , are derived .",
    "another bound relating the maximum cardinality of cdcs to that of subspace codes is given in @xcite .",
    "bounds and constructions of subspace codes are also investigated in @xcite . despite the previous works , two significant problems remain open .",
    "first , despite the aforementioned advantage of cdcs , what is the rate loss of cdcs as opposed to subspace codes of the same minimum distance and hence error correction capability ?",
    "since random linear network coding achieves multicast capacity with probability exponentially approaching 1 with the length of the code @xcite , the asymptotic rates of subspace codes and asymptotic rate loss of cdcs are both significant .",
    "the second problem involves the two metrics that have been introduced for subspace codes : what is the difference between the two metrics proposed for subspace codes and cdcs beyond those discussed in @xcite ? note that the two questions are somewhat related , since the first question is applicable for both metrics .",
    "the answers to these questions are significant to the code design for error control in random linear network coding .    aiming to answer these two questions , our work in this paper focuses on the packing and covering properties of subspace codes .",
    "packing and covering properties not only are interesting in their own right as fundamental geometric properties , also are significant for various practical purposes . first , our work is motivated by their significance to design and decoding of subspace codes .",
    "since a code can be viewed as a packing of its ambient space , the significance of packing properties is clear .",
    "in contrast , the importance of covering properties is more subtle and deserves more explanation .",
    "for example , a class of nearly optimal cdcs , referred to as liftings of rank metric codes , have covering radii no less than their minimum distance and thus are not optimal cdcs @xcite .",
    "this example shows how a covering property is relevant to the design of subspace codes .",
    "the covering radius also characterizes the decoding performance of a code , since it is the maximum weight of a decodable error by minimum distance decoding @xcite and also has applications to decoding with erasures @xcite .",
    "second , covering properties are also important for other reasons . for example , covering properties are important for the security of keystreams against cryptanalytic attacks @xcite .",
    "our main contributions of this paper are that for both metrics , we first determine some fundamental geometric properties of the projective space , and then use these properties to derive bounds and to determine the asymptotic rates of subspace codes based on packing and covering .",
    "our results provide some answers to both open problems above .",
    "first , our results show that for both metrics optimal packing cdcs are optimal packing subspace codes up to a scalar if and only if their dimension is half of their length ( up to rounding ) , which implies that in this case cdcs suffer from a limited rate loss as opposed to subspace codes with the same minimum distance .",
    "furthermore , when the asymptotic rate of subspace codes is fixed , the relative subspace distance of optimal subspace codes is twice as much as the relative injection distance .",
    "second , our results illustrate the difference between the two metrics from a geometric perspective . above all",
    ", the projective space has different geometric properties under the two metrics .",
    "the different geometric properties further result in different asymptotic rates of covering codes with the two metrics .",
    "with the injection metric , optimal covering cdcs can be used to construct asymptotically optimal covering subspace codes .",
    "however , with the subspace metric , this does not hold .    to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "our results on the geometric properties of the projective space are novel , and our investigation of covering properties of subspace codes is the first one in the literature . note that our investigation of covering properties differs from the study in @xcite : while how cdcs cover the grassmannian was investigated in @xcite , we consider how subspace codes cover the whole projective space in this paper .",
    "our investigation of packing properties leads to tighter bounds than the gilbert bound in @xcite , and our relation between the optimal cardinalities of subspace codes and cdcs is also more precise than that in @xcite .",
    "our asymptotic rates based on packing properties also appear to be novel .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : preliminaries ] reviews necessary background on subspace codes , cdcs , and related concepts . in section  [ sec : subspace ] , we investigate the packing and covering properties of subspace codes with the subspace metric . in section  [ sec : injection ] , we study the packing and covering properties of subspace codes with the injection metric .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : conclusion ] summarizes our results and provides future work directions .",

    "the authors are grateful to the anonymous reviewers and the associate editor dr .",
    "mario blaum for their constructive comments , which have helped to improve this paper .",
    "we now prove the bounds on @xmath80 for @xmath228 . by definition",
    ", @xmath229 is a double summation of exponential terms .",
    "the main idea of the proof is to determine the largest term in the summation : this not only gives a good lower bound , but the whole summation can also be upper bounded by that term times a constant .",
    "first , by lemma  [ lemma : ns ] , @xmath230 , where @xmath231 satisfies @xmath232 . thus @xmath233 by ( [ eq : gaussian ] ) , where @xmath234 .",
    "hence , @xmath235 , where @xmath236 .",
    "since @xmath237 is maximized for @xmath238 , we need to consider the following three cases .",
    "* case i : @xmath239 .",
    "we have @xmath240 and hence @xmath237 is maximized for @xmath241 : @xmath242 .",
    "thus @xmath243 , and it is easy to show that @xmath244 since @xmath245 .",
    "* case ii : @xmath246 .",
    "we have @xmath247 and hence @xmath237 is maximized for @xmath248 : @xmath249 .",
    "it is easily shown that @xmath250 for all @xmath251 and hence @xmath252 .",
    "we also obtain @xmath253 .",
    "* case iii : @xmath254 .",
    "we have @xmath255 and hence @xmath237 is maximized for @xmath256 : @xmath257 .",
    "thus @xmath258 , and it is easy to show that @xmath259 since @xmath260 .",
    "first , @xmath278 .",
    "we now prove the upper bound by determining the largest term in the double summation of @xmath217 . since @xmath279 , we assume @xmath34 without loss of generality .",
    "the triangular inequality indicates that @xmath280 if @xmath281 or @xmath282 ; also , by definition of the injection distance , @xmath280 if @xmath283 .",
    "we can hence restrict the range of parameters in the summation formula of @xmath217 as follows : @xmath284 by lemma  [ lemma : nm ] and [ eq : gaussian ] , we have @xmath285 for @xmath286 and @xmath287 for @xmath288 , which with ( [ eq : range_vi ] ) yields @xmath289 where we make the following changes of variables : @xmath290 , @xmath291 , @xmath292 in ( [ eq : vi1 ] ) . since @xmath293 , we have @xmath294 . also , @xmath295 for @xmath296 , and hence @xmath297 ; similarly , we obtain @xmath298 .",
    "hence , ( [ eq : vi1 ] ) leads to @xmath299 where we set @xmath300 and use @xmath301 in ( [ eq : vi3 ] ) .",
