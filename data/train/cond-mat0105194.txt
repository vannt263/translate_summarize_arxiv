    "these conclusions hold for the linear conductance @xmath75 as well , since the conductance and the transmission coefficient possess the same resonant structure at low temperatures .",
    "our theoretical results are consistent with the experiment observations in the conductance of triple sites@xcite .",
    "as can be found from our previous analysis , the condition for perfect transmission is different for one , two and three site structures .",

    "we constrain ourselves to the case when the inter - site couplings are the same , which corresponds to the monovalent atomic wire case@xcite .",
    "when the number @xmath4 of sites is odd , one finds that the current through the middle site @xmath174 can be written as @xmath175       \\frac{\\gamma_{ld}\\gamma_{rd}}{\\gamma_{ld}+\\gamma_{rd } }       img^r_{\\frac{n-1}{2}\\frac{n-1}{2}}(\\epsilon),\\ ] ] where @xmath176 , @xmath177 , with @xmath178 and @xmath179 are the green s functions decoupled from the middle site @xmath174 . in eq .",
    "( 55 ) we denote the chemical potential of the site left(right ) to the middle site by @xmath180 ( @xmath181 ) which equals to the chemical potential @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) in the equilibrium . the conductance at resonance can then be expressed as @xmath182 obviously , the conductance reaches @xmath183 only if @xmath184 , which implies @xmath84 from the expressions of @xmath185 and @xmath186 .",
    "when the site number @xmath4 is even , one can divide the lattice into two parts and then the current from the site @xmath187 to @xmath188 can be written as @xcite @xmath189     \\frac{4t^2img^r_{\\frac{n}{2}l}img^r_{\\frac{n+2}{2}r } }    { |1-t^2g^r_{\\frac{n}{2}l}g^r_{\\frac{n+2}{2}r}|^2}.\\ ] ] the conductance at resonance ( @xmath190 ) is @xmath191 if @xmath192 , one needs @xmath193 , which eventually yields @xmath194 after simple calculation .",
    "it is in fact the perfect transmission condition in the case of double sites .",
    "physically the even - odd dependence of conductance reflects the different conditions of constructive interference in the different circumstances . for the lattice with odd number of sites",
    ", one can view the array as a single site coupled with two renormalized leads .",
    "if the number of sites is even , the lattice can be considered as a two renormalized normal metal contact or a double sites coupled with two renormalized leads .",
    "the condition for perfect transmission is more strict in the later case .    finally , we would like discuss possible effects arising from electron - electron interaction .",
    "it is expected that the main results may hold as well . in the presence of on - site coulomb interaction , an additional term of self - energy",
    "will be introduced for the green function of each site .",
    "the effect is just shifting the site level and splitting the resonance position at absolute zero temperature , since elastic scattering can only be expected at zero temperature.@xcite the central formula @xmath2 remains formally the same in the presence of interactions as long as the ground - state of the system possess fermi liquid properties.@xcite",
    "in summary , using the keldysh nonequilibrium green function method , we have derived the formulas to calculate the transmission coefficient , current and conductance of a chian of coupled @xmath4 site system . an effective and convenient procedure to calculate recursively the retarded(advanced ) and lesser(greater ) green functions has been developed .",
    "based on the formulation developed , we have analyzed the transmission spectra of just single site , double site and triple site structures in detail , obtaining some well - know results and finding some new features in the transmission spectra of double and triple site systems .",
    "when the electron levels of @xmath4 sites are aligned , we have obtained an analytical expression for the condition for perfect transmission , demonstrating the even - odd parity effect in the transmission of a generic one dimensional lattices with inversion symmetry .",
