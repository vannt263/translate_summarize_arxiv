    "the proximity effect in thin film heterostructures combining superconducting ( s ) and ferromagnetic ( f ) layers is a topic of great current interest @xcite .",

    "another closely related phenomenon is the occurrence of so - called @xmath3-coupling in sfs - type josephson junctions ( jjs ) . for certain thickness ranges of the ferromagnetic layer @xmath5 the josephson coupling energy @xmath7 has a minimum for a phase difference @xmath8 and not for @xmath9 as in normal josephson junctions .",
    "the ground state of the josephson junction oscillates between @xmath2- and @xmath3-coupling with the oscillation period given by @xmath10 .",
    "the magnitude of the magnetic length @xmath11 depends on the kind of transport regime . in the clean limit , i.e. ,",
    "when for the electron mean free path @xmath12 in the ferromagnet @xmath13 holds , it is determined by @xmath14 , with the fermi velocity @xmath15 , the exchange energy @xmath16 and planck s constant @xmath17 . in the dirty limit , i.e.",

    "the decay length @xmath25 and the oscillation length @xmath26 are different . in the limit @xmath27 they are related by the equation @xcite : @xmath28 where the positive and negative sign in the denominator refers to @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
