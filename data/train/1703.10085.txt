    "v404 cygni ( hereafter ) , also known as gs 2023 + 338 , is a low mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) located at a distance of @xmath1 kpc , accurately inferred by a parallax measurement @xcite .",
    "the system is composed of a @xmath2 @xmath3 black hole ( bh ) and a @xmath4 @xmath3 k3 iii companion star with an orbital period of @xmath5 days @xcite and a @xmath6 inclination with respect to the line of sight @xcite .",
    "was discovered as a nova during an optical outburst in 1938 , and it was observed for the first time in the x - ray band by the ginga satellite , during an intense outburst in 1989 @xcite .",
    "lmxbs are usually transient systems , showing long periods of quiescence ( years ) , with faint and rapidly variable emission in the x - ray and radio frequencies @xcite , and bright outburst states ( weeks / months ) . the x - ray luminosities span from @xmath7 @xmath8 during quiescence phase up to eddington limit ( @xmath9 @xmath8 for a 9 @xmath10 bh ) in the outburst states @xcite .    after a quiescence period of @xmath1126 years",

    "the correlated variability between optical and x - ray emissions during the bright june 2015 activity has been interpreted as a consequence of the instability of its large accretion disk ( the outer accretion disk radius is @xmath12 km ) .",
    "a disruption of the accreting mass inflow into the inner part of the disk can represent a critical factor to explain the observed scenario of this intense outburst : large - amplitude fluctuations which rapidly ended after only two weeks .",
    "the outburst possibly started in the innermost part of the disk , but it was not sustained by the accretion .",
    "the mass inflow could be disrupted either by a low surface density in the outer part of the disk  because of its long orbital period @xcite  or by a strong outer - disk wind regulating the accretion @xcite .    in june 2015 , besides optical and x - ray intense variable emissions , indicating the combined activity of the corona - disk system , observations in radio @xcite and energies @xcite confirmed the ejection of relativistic plasma jets . in particular , hints of @xmath13 pair annihilation , which are consistent with a microquasar scenario , have been found by integral during the active phase @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present the agile observations of during the peak phase of this intense activity , compare the results with the data , and analyze the high - energy ( he ) emission in a multi - wavelength context .",
    "we analyzed the data collected by the _ grid _ ( gamma - ray imaging detector , @xcite ) , the silicon - tracker imager on board the agile satellite ( for a detailed description of the agile payload : @xcite ) , and we compared our results with the observations of the system ( see appendix  [ appdx : fermi ] ) .",

    "the multiwavelength pattern is very similar to the cyg x-3 evolution around the flare @xcite , and it is consistent with a microquasar behavior , in which transient jets are responsible for the high - energy emission ( see section [ sec : microquasar ] ) .",
    "while the hard x - ray emission monitored by in the 1550 kev range is fully dominated by the disk - corona activity , the radio ( ratan-600 ) and soft / he radiation ( integral / spi and ) clearly indicate the presence of a relativistic jet .",

    "the multiwavelength behavior suggests that he activity is associated only with the highest activity phase of plasma ejection in the jet . in a jet scenario ,",
    "the observed he must be produced outside the hot and dense corona region that is opaque ( due to @xmath13 pair production ) for photon energies @xmath41 . according to this picture , he produced in the innermost part of the jet are converted to pair plasma .",
    "there is a continuous creation and annihilation of plasma close to the central source , forming a broad annihilation line @xcite . outside the coronal plasma ,",

    "it was found that both a leptonic ( inverse compton , ic ) and hadronic ( @xmath44-decay ) scenario can account for the he emission , although ic processes can explain in a more natural way the modulation and the multiwavelength links @xcite .    in , the simultaneous detection of he , @xmath13 annihilation emission and a strong radio outburst can support a microquasar scenario with a dominant leptonic component responsible for the observed pattern of emission ( at radio , hard - x / soft - and he frequencies ) .    in this work ,",

    "nevertheless , we have indications of a soft - spectrum he emission with no significant signal observed above 400 mev .",
    "if we take into account the strong emission detected up to soft by integral and compare it with the low significance he flux detected by the and , we could ask ourselves whether the bulk radiation is concentrated in the energy band between 1 and 50 mev , a frequency window that current detectors can not observe . by a qualitative extrapolation to this energy range  based on the observed trend ( see fig .
