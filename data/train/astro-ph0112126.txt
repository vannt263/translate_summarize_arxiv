    "on april 30 , sn  1999by was independently discovered at about @xmath5 by @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "images with the katzman automatic imaging telescope @xcite of the same field provide an upper limit of @xmath6 on april 25.2 ut .",
    "the supernova ( sn ) was found in the sb galaxy ngc  2841 which has been the host of three previous supernovae : sn  1912a , sn  1957a , and sn  1972r @xcite . based on optical spectra ,",
    "sn  1999by was identified as a type  ia sn @xcite .",
    "shortly thereafter , @xcite reported that sn  1999by showed stronger than normal 5800    absorption and depressed flux near 4000   , suggesting that sn  1999by would be a significantly subluminous type  ia event .    according to @xcite ,",
    "sn  1999by reached a maximum light of @xmath7 on ut 1999 may 10.5 , and a maximum in the @xmath8 band of @xmath9 .",
    "the lyon / meudon extragalactic database ( leda ) , gives the heliocentric radial velocity of ngc  2841 , corrected for virgo infall , as @xmath10 km  s@xmath11 .",
    "using @xmath12 km  s@xmath11  mpc@xmath11 puts the distance to ngc  2841 at 12.5 mpc with a distance modulus of @xmath13 . using this distance modulus and the photometry of @xcite , the absolute peak magnitudes of sn  1999by are @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "thus , sn  1999by is underluminous by roughly 2.5 magnitudes as compared to a typical type  ia supernova ( sn  ia ) .",
    "detailed analysis of the optical light curves ( lcs ) by @xcite confirm these basic results",
    ". the light curve of sn  1999by shows a very steep post - maximum brightness decline @xmath16 of @xmath17 to @xmath18 .",
    "based on detailed fits of the lcs , @xcite find the interstellar reddening to be @xmath19 which is in agreement with the values for galactic reddening given by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath20 ) , and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath21 ) .",
    "recently , @xcite provided detailed optical lcs and spectra and found values consistent with previous data .",
    "these measurements imply that sn  1999by was as underluminous as sn  1991bg , the prototypical example of the subluminous type  ia subclass @xcite .",
    "other members include sn  1992k @xcite , sn  1997cn @xcite , and sn  1998de @xcite .",
    "some defining characteristics of the subclass are rapidly declining light curves ( @xmath22 ) , peak magnitudes fainter than normal by 23 mag , and redder colors at maximum light ( @xmath23 @xmath24 0.40.5@xmath25 ) .",
    "one of the currently active areas in sne  ia research concerns the nature of these subluminous events .",
    "theoretical interpretations of subluminous sn  ia include all three types of explosion mechanism : the centrally triggered detonation of a sub - chandrasekhar mass wd , deflagration and delayed detonations of massive wd and two merging wds ( see sect .",

    ". , 1995 ; nugent et al . , 1995 , milne et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the possibility has also been raised that sn1991bg - like sne  ia should not be classified with other sne  ia at all as they may arise from different progenitors .",
    "sn  1999by is one of the best observed sne  ia with data superior to that of sn  1991bg .",
    "in addition to the studies of optical light curves and spectra mentioned above , detailed polarization spectra of sn  1999by have been obtained and analyzed @xcite .",
    "whereas ` normal ' sne  ia tend to show little or no polarization ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this supernova was significantly polarized , up to 0.7% , indicating an overall asphericity of @xmath26 .",
    "this result suggests that there may be a connection between the observed asphericity and the subluminosity in sne  ia .    in recent years",
    "it has become apparent that infrared spectroscopic observations can be used as valuable tools to determine the chemical structure of sn  ia envelopes .",
    "for instance , near - infrared spectra can be used to locate the boundaries between explosive carbon and oxygen burning , or between complete and incomplete silicon burning by measuring , and iron - group lines @xcite . however , the difficulties involved in obtaining high quality infrared spectra of supernovae has limited ir studies to a small handful of objects .",
    "the study of sn  1994d by @xcite is the only one to include both pre- and post - maximum spectra .",
    "since most of their spectra was of the 11.3  region , @xcite concentrated on determining the origin of a feature at 1.05  .",
    "they concluded that this feature might be due to either 1.083  or  1.0926 , but found difficulties with both identifications .",
    "detailed modeling of sn  1994d and sn  1986 g was able to reproduce the basic nir spectral features and their evolution @xcite .",
    "in particular , the identification of the 1.05  feature in sn  1994d as due to could be established ( recently confirmed by @xcite ) , and a broad feature , appearing between @xmath27 and 1.9  was identified as a blend of iron - group elements .",
    "we note that the nature of subluminous sne  ia is important for the use of sne  ia as distance indicators .",
    "in particular , the calibration of the brightness decline relation depends critically on subluminous sne  ia because they significantly increase the required baseline observations . from this perspective",
    ", it may turn out to be critical to determine whether all sne  ia form a homogeneous class of objects or not .",
    "however , current limitations of model calculations will not allow us to improve the accuracy of the current estimates for the absolute distance to sn  1999by , and the possible implications of our results on the use of sne  ia for cosmology is not the subject of this paper . in this paper",
    ", we present near - infrared spectra of sn  1999by covering the time evolution of the supernova from about four days before to two weeks after maximum light .",
    "detailed models of the sn explosion based on a delayed detonation ( dd ) scenario are used to analyze the data .",
    "the explosion models , light curves , and synthetic spectra are calculated in a self - consistent manner .",
    "given the initial structure of the progenitor and description of the nuclear burning front , the light curves and spectra are calculated from the explosion model without any further tuning .",
    "the observations and data reduction are discussed in  2 . in  3 , general properties of the explosion models , light curves and spectra are discussed for normal and subluminous sne  ia within the dd scenario . in  4 , a specific model for this sn is chosen by matching the properties of the predicted light curve to those observed in optical studies of sn  1999by .",
    "synthetic optical and ir spectra for this model are then presented and the latter are compared to the observed ir spectra .",
    "detailed line identifications for the infrared features are provided .",
    "the effects on the predicted spectra of large scale mixing during the deflagration phase also examined . in  5 , we discuss the implications for progenitors and alternative explosion mechanisms .",
    "we close in  6 with a final discussion of the results for sn 1999by , and put our findings in context with other sne  ia and different explosion scenarios .",
    "low - dispersion ( r @xmath28 700 ) , near - infrared spectra of sn  1999by from 1.02.4  were obtained with the 2.4 m hiltner telescope at mdm observatory during the nights of 610 may 1999 .",
    "the data were collected using tifkam ( a.k.a .",

    "k _ filters for broadband imaging , or with a variety of grisms , blocking filters , and an east - west oriented @xmath30 slit for low ( @xmath31 ) and moderate ( @xmath32 ) resolution spectroscopy .",
    "sn  1999by was observed with three different spectroscopic setups , which covered the 0.961.80  , 1.22.2  , and 1.952.4  wavelength regions .",
    "the observations were broken into multiple 600  s exposures . between each exposure , the supernova light was dithered along the slit to minimize the effect of detector defects and provide first - order background subtraction .",
    "total exposure times vary from spectrum to spectrum and are listed in the log of nir observations in table  [ nirlog ] .",
    "wavelength calibration of the spectra was achieved by observing neon , argon , and xenon arc lamps .",
    "the spectra were corrected for telluric absorption by observing a  stars and early g  dwarfs at similar airmass , chosen from the bright star catalog @xcite . applying the procedure described by @xcite ,",
    "stellar features were removed from the g  dwarf spectra by dividing by a normalized solar spectrum @xcite .",
    "the results were used to correct for telluric absorption in the a  stars .",
    "hydrogen features in the corrected a  star spectra were removed from the raw a  star spectra and the results were used to correct the target data for telluric absorption .",
    "[ for further discussion of this procedure see @xcite , and references therein . ]",
    "the instrumental response was calibrated by matching the continuum of the a  star telluric standards to the stellar atmosphere models of @xcite .",

    "k _ broadband images of sn  1999by and @xcite photometric standards .",
    "the resulting photometry is listed in table  [ nirlog ] and was used to set the flux levels of the corresponding spectra . a square bandpass was assumed and the flux levels thus attained are believed accurate to @xmath33 2030% . for may 9 and 10 no flux information was available , but the observed spectral bands had large overlaps , and the relative flux levels were set by matching the data in the overlapping regions .",
    "near - infrared spectra of a star @xmath34 north and @xmath35 west of sn  1999by @xcite were also obtained and reduced in the same manner .",
    "this star was then used as a local relative spectrophotometric standard to reduce spectroscopic data from later observing runs .",
    "spectra of sn  1999by covering 1.01.8   were collected on five more nights during the following two weeks ( 16 may , 18 may , 20 may , 21 may and 24 may ) .",
    "the first three were obtained by p. martini and a. steed using tifkam on the 2.4 m telescope at mdm , and the last two by s. sakai using tifkam on the 2.1 m telescope at the kitt peak national observatory .",
    "figure  [ nirspec ] shows a plot of all the nir spectra .",
    "since absolute fluxes were only available for the first three spectra , the data are presented in arbitrary flux units , and they have been shifted vertically for clarity .",
    "regions of very low s / n due to strong telluric absorption have been omitted .",
    "the epochs listed are relative to 10 may 1999 , the date of @xmath36 given by @xcite .",
    "like all the subsequent plots , the data have been corrected to the 638 km  s@xmath11 redshift of ngc  2841 @xcite .",
    "there is general agreement that sne  ia result from some process involving the combustion of a degenerate white dwarf @xcite . within this general picture ,",
    "three classes of models have been considered : ( 1 ) an explosion of a co - wd , with mass close to the chandrasekhar limit , which accretes mass through roche - lobe overflow from an evolved companion star @xcite .",
    "the explosion is triggered by compressional heating near the wd center .",
    "( 2 ) an explosion of a rotating configuration formed from the merging of two low - mass wds , caused by the loss of angular momentum through gravitational radiation @xcite . ( 3 ) explosion of a low mass co - wd triggered by the detonation of a helium layer @xcite .",
    "only the first two models appear to be viable for normal type  ia sne as the third , the sub - chandrasekhar wd model , has been ruled out on the basis of predicted light curves and spectra @xcite .",
    "still , theoretical interpretations of subluminous sn  ia include all three types of explosion mechanism @xcite .",
    "the possibility has also been raised that the subluminous sn  1991bg - like supernovae may arise from different progenitors and should not be classified with other sne  ia at all .    within @xmath37 models",
    ", it is believed that the burning front starts as a subsonic deflagration . however , the time evolution of the burning front is still an open question .",
    "that is , whether the deflagration front burns through the entire wd @xcite , or alternatively , transitions into a supersonic detonation mode as suggested in the delayed detonation ( dd ) model @xcite .",
    "dd models have been found to reproduce the optical and infrared light curves and spectra of ` typical ' sne  ia reasonably well ( @xcite , h95 hereafter ; @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , dd models provide a natural explanation for the brightness decline relation @xmath38 observed in the light curves of sne  ia @xcite .",
    "this is a consequence of the temperature dependence of the opacity and the lack of a dependence of the explosion energy on the amount of @xmath0 produced ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , within the delayed detonation scenario , both normal and subluminous sne  ia can be explained as variants of a single phenomenon ( h95 , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this makes the dd model an attractive scenario and it is used as the basis for our present analysis .    in our models , the explosions lcs and spectra",
    "are all calculated self - consistently . given the initial structure of the progenitor and a description of the nuclear burning front , the light curves and spectra are calculated directly from the explosion model without any additional parameters .",
    "since the predicted observables follow directly from the supernova model , this approach provides a direct link between the observations and the explosion physics and progenitor properties .",
    "finally , we note that detailed analyses of observed sn  ia spectra and light curves indicate that mergers @xcite and pure deflagration sne ( such as the w7 model ) could contribute to the population of bright sne  ia ( @xcite , hereafter hk96 ; @xcite ) . on the other hand , it is not obvious that subluminous sne  ia and the brightness decline relation can be understood within pure deflagration models . in particular , the amount of burning , and consequently the explosion energy , will be strongly correlated with @xmath0 production .",
    "since no detailed studies for deflagration models have been performed , these models can not be ruled out but , as we discuss in  5 , the ir spectra of sn  1999by are hard to reconcile with a pure deflagration .        despite recent progress in our understanding of nuclear burning fronts , current 3-d models",
    "are not sufficiently evolved to allow for a consistent treatment of the burning front throughout all phases ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also  4.3 &  5 ) .",
    "thus detailed models rely on parameterized descriptions guided by 3-d results . within spherical models ,",
    "the transition from deflagration to detonation can be conveniently parameterized by a density @xmath39 which has been found to be the dominating factor for the determining chemical structure , light curves and spectra .",
    "we have calculated explosion models using a one - dimensional radiation - hydro code ( hk96 ) that solves the hydrodynamical equations explicitly by the piecewise parabolic method @xcite .",
    "nuclear burning is taken into account using an extended network of 606 isotopes from n , p to @xmath40 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the propagation of the nuclear burning front is given by the velocity of sound behind the burning front in the case of a detonation wave , and in a parameterized form during the deflagration phase calibrated by detailed 3-d calculations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we use the parameterization as described in @xcite . for a deflagration front at distance @xmath41 from the center",
    ", we assume that the burning velocity is given by @xmath42 , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the laminar and turbulent velocities with @xmath45}\\ ] ] with   @xmath46  and   @xmath47 here @xmath48 is the atwood number , @xmath49 is the characteristic length scale , and @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the densities in front of and behind the burning front , respectively . the quantities @xmath52 and @xmath49",
    "are directly taken from the hydrodynamical model at the location of the burning front and we take @xmath53 .",
    "the transition density is treated as a free parameter .      from these explosion models , the subsequent expansion , bolometric and broad band light curves ( lc )",
    "are calculated following the method described by @xcite , and references therein .",
    "the lc - code is the same used for the explosion except that @xmath54-ray transport is included via a monte carlo scheme and nuclear burning is neglected . in order to allow a more consistent treatment of the expansion",
    ", we solve the time - dependent , frequency - averaged radiation moment equations .",
    "the frequency - averaged variable eddington factors and mean opacities are calculated by solving the frequency - dependent transport equations .",
    "about one thousand frequencies ( in one hundred frequency groups ) and about nine hundred depth points are used . at each time step",
    ", we use t(r ) to determine the eddington factors and mean opacities by solving the frequency - dependent radiation transport equation in a co - moving frame and integrate to obtain the frequency - averaged quantities .",
    "the averaged opacities have been calculated assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) .",
    "both the monochromatic and mean opacities are calculated in the narrow line limit .",
    "scattering , photon redistribution , and thermalization terms used in the light curve opacity calculations are taken into account .    in previous works ( e.g. @xcite )",
    ", the photon redistribution and thermalization terms have been calibrated for a sample of spectra using the formalism of the equivalent two level approach ( h95 ) . for increased consistency",
    ", we use the same equations and atomic models but solve the rate equations simultaneously with the light curves calculation at about every 100@xmath55 time step , at the expense of some simplifications in the nlte - part compared to h95 . for the opacities we use the narrow line limit , and for the radiation fields we use the solution of the monochromatic radiation transport using @xmath56 frequency groups .",
    "our non - lte code ( h95 , and references therein ) solves the relativistic radiation transport equations in a co - moving frame .",
    "the spectra are computed for various epochs using the chemical , density , and luminosity structure and @xmath54-ray deposition resulting from the light curve coder .",
    "this provides a tight coupling between the explosion model and the radiative transfer .",
    "the effects of instantaneous energy deposition by @xmath54-rays , the stored energy ( in the thermal bath and in ionization ) and the energy loss due to the adiabatic expansion are taken into account .",
    "bound - bound , bound - free and free - free opacities are included in the radiation transport which has been discretized by about @xmath57 frequencies and 97 radial points .",
    "the radiation transport equations are solved consistently with the statistical equations and ionization due to @xmath54-radiation for the most important elements and ions .",
    "typically , between 27 to 137 bound levels are taken into account .",
    "we use ( 27/123/242 ) , ( 43/129/431 ) , ( 20/60/153 ) , ( 35/212/506 ) , ( 41/195/742 ) , ( 62/75/592 ) , ( 137/3120/7293 ) , ( 84/1355/5396 ) , ( 71/865/3064 ) where the first , second and third numbers in brackets denote the number of levels , bound - bound transitions , and number of discrete lines for the radiation transport .",
    "the latter number is larger because nearby levels within multiplets have been merged for the rates .",
    "the neighboring ionization stages have been approximated by simplified atomic models restricted to a few nlte levels + lte levels .",
    "the energy levels and cross sections of bound - bound transitions are taken from @xcite starting at the ground state .",
    "the bound - free cross sections are taken from topbase 0.5 as implemented in straburg @xcite .",
    "collisional transitions are treated in the ` classical ' hydrogen - like approximation @xcite that relates the radiative to the collisional gf - values .",
    "all form factors are set to 1 .",
    "about 10@xmath58 additional lines are included ( out of a line list of @xmath59 ) assuming lte - level populations .",
    "the scattering , photon redistribution , and thermalization terms are computed with an equivalent - two - level formalism that is calibrated using nlte models .",
    "spherical dynamical explosions , light curves , and spectra are calculated for both normal bright and subluminous sne  ia . due to the one - dimensional nature of the models , the moment of the transition to a detonation",
    "is a free parameter .",
    "the moment of deflagration - to - detonation transition ( ddt ) is conveniently parameterized by introducing the transition density , @xmath60 , at which ddt happens .    within the dd scenario ,",
    "the free model parameters are : 1 ) the chemical structure of the exploding wd , 2 ) its central density @xmath61 at the time of the explosion , 3 ) the description of the deflagration front , and 4 ) the density @xmath39 at which the transition from deflagration to detonation occurs .",
    "note that the density structure of a wd only weakly depends on the temperature because it is highly degenerate . the central density",
    "@xmath61 depends mainly on the history of accretion .",
    "model parameters have been chosen for the progenitor and @xmath61 which allow us to reproduce light curves and spectra of ` typical ' type ia supernovae .    in all models",
    ", the structure of the exploding c / o white dwarf is based on a model star with 5 m@xmath62 at the main sequence and solar metallicity . through accretion , this core has been grown close to the chandrasekhar limit ( see model 5p0y23z22 in @xcite ) . at the time of the explosion of the wd , its central density is 2.0@xmath63 g  @xmath64 and its mass is close to 1.37@xmath65 .",
    "the transition density @xmath39 has been identified as the main factor which determines the @xmath0 production and , thus the brightness of a sne  ia ( h95 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "some of the basic quantities are given in table  [ modelprop ] .      here",
    "we will restrict our discussion to the basic features of dd models which are relevant for the spectral analysis of sn  1999by .",
    "for a more detailed discussion of the hydrodynamical evolution of dd - models , see @xcite , h95 , and references therein .    during the deflagration phase ,",
    "the wd is lifted , starts to expand , and after burning about 0.22 to 0.28 @xmath65 , the transition to a detonation is triggered .",
    "figures [ density ] and [ abundance ] show the density , velocity and chemical structures for representative models after a homologous expansion has been achieved .",
    "the final velocity and density structures are rather similar .",
    "the expansion velocities decrease slightly with @xmath39 because a significant amount of oxygen remains unburned and did not contribute to the energy production . in 5p0z22.8 ,",
    "oxygen remained unburned in the outer @xmath68 .",
    "overall , the density is decreasing with radius because burning took place throughout the entire wd except in the very outer layers .",
    "in contrast , pure deflagration model such as w7 @xcite , pulsating delayed detonation @xcite , and merger models @xcite show a significant density bump at the boundary between burned and unburned layers .",
    "iron group elements are produced in the inner layers where density and temperature stay high for a sufficient time during the explosion , whereas intermediate mass elements are produced in the layers above where nuclear statistical equilibrium ( nse ) has no time to set in . in the outer zones , products of explosive oxygen ( e.g. si , s ) and explosive carbon burning ( o , mg , ne ) and some si are seen .",
    "only a very thin layer of unburned c / o remains .    for layers with final velocities",
    "@xmath69  km  s@xmath11 , the densities in the early stages of the explosion are sufficiently high for electron capture .",
    "this results in the production of @xmath70fe & @xmath71ni whereas in the outer layers only @xmath72ni is produced .",
    "we employ the same description for the deflagration front in all models and , consequently , the very inner structures are almost identical in all models .",
    "a small dip in the ni abundance is present at the ddt because the time scales for burning to nse are comparable to the expansion time scales at densities of @xmath73 g  @xmath64 .",
    "this feature can be expected to be smeared out in multi - dimensional calculations @xcite .",
    "after the ddt , a detonation front develops and the burning of fuel is triggered by compression of unburned material .",
    "consequently , burning takes place under higher densities compared to a deflagration .",
    "in general , additional material is burned up to nse and this extends the layers of @xmath72ni for all @xmath74 g  @xmath64 . for models with smaller @xmath39 , burning only proceeds up to si despite the compression .",
    "this increases the production of intermediate mass elements ( e.g. si , s ) at the expense of @xmath72ni . in our models , the efficiency for @xmath72ni production drops rapidly as a function of decreasing @xmath39 ( see table  [ modelprop ] ) .",
    "we note that for @xmath75 g  @xmath64 , nuclear burning stops all together for @xmath76 and , unlike any observed sn , one would see a very slowly expanding c / o envelope heated by little @xmath72ni .",
    "there exists a rather strict lower limit for the absolute brightness of sne  ia within the chandrasekhar mass models .",
    "this can be understood as follows .",
    "the absolute brightness of a sne  ia is mainly determined by the @xmath0 . in general , @xmath0 is produced both during the deflagration and the detonation phase . for the most subluminous sne",
    "ia however , no @xmath0 is produced during the detonation . within the @xmath37 scenario and dd - models in particular ,",
    "we need to burn a minimum of @xmath77 during the deflagration to achieve the required ` lift / pre - expansion ' of the wd . during the deflagration phase",
    ", iron group elements are produced .",
    "the fraction of @xmath0 depends on the amount of material which undergoes electron capture , i.e. on the central density and , to a smaller extent , on the description of the burning front ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . for a model with @xmath78 g  @xmath64",
    ", we find a lower limit of @xmath79 .",
    "recently , @xcite studied the influence of @xmath80 between 1.5 to @xmath81 g  @xmath64 on the nuclear burning for similar dd - models with a high transition density which may describe ` normal ' sn  ia . in those models , the @xmath0 produced during the deflagration phase varies by @xmath82 which provides an estimate for the possible variation in the minimum @xmath83 production .",
    "we conclude that there exists a lower limit of @xmath84 within dd - models .    in principle , 3-d effects may change the lower limit for the @xmath0 production .",
    "however , all current 3-d calculations show that rising blobs are formed at high densities which undergo complete si - burning because the burning time scales to ni shorter than the hydro time scales . in the case of a ddt or a transition to a phase of very fast deflagration , the amount of burning will likely be similar to the 1-d case .",
    "thus , we do not expect a significant change in the minimum @xmath85 production .",
    "optical light curves and spectra of sn  ia are not the subject of this paper but we used their general properties for selecting a model for sn1999by .    within the dd scenario ,",
    "both normal and subluminous sne  ia can be produced ( h95 , @xcite , hkw95 hereafter ; @xcite ) .",
    "the amount of @xmath72ni ( @xmath86 ) depends primarily on @xmath39 ( h95 ; hkw95 ; @xcite ) and to a much lesser extent on the assumed value of the deflagration speed , initial central density of the wd , and initial chemical composition ( ratio of carbon to oxygen ) .",
    "models with smaller transition density give less nickel and hence both lower peak luminosity and lower temperatures ( hkw95 , @xcite ) . in dds ,",
    "almost the entire wd is burned and the total production of nuclear energy is almost constant .",
    "this and the dominance of @xmath39 for determining the @xmath0 production are the basis of why , to first approximation , sne  ia appear to be a one - parameter family .    the observed @xmath16 relation can be understood as an opacity effect @xcite , namely , the consequence of rapidly dropping opacities at low temperatures @xcite .",

    "this might indicate that sn  1999by has a slightly lower temperature in the outer layers compared to the model , which would cause less excitation of carbon and , might cut off the high velocity contribution to the absorption .",
    "secondly , in the model spectrum there seems to be a lack of emission produced by near 1.18 .",
    "we note that similar problems with si are also commonly present in the optical line at about 6380   for normal sne  ia @xcite .",

    "as we have seen , model 5p0z22.8 reproduces the basic features of both optical and ir spectra , including the time evolution .",
    "this suggests that dd models are a reasonably good description for subluminous sne  ia .",
    "unfortunately , we are still missing a handle on an important piece of physics .",
    "the propagation of a detonation front is well understood but the description of the deflagration front and the deflagration to detonation transition ( ddt ) pose problems .",
    "currently , state of the art allows us to follow the front only through the phase of linear instabilities , i.e. only the early part of the deflagration phase .",
    "the resulting structures of these calculations can not account for the observations of typical sne  ia ( khokhlov 2001 ) , because a significant fraction of the wd ( @xmath128 ) remains unburned .",
    "nevertheless , these calculations point toward a more general problem , or toward a better understanding of the nature of subluminous sne  ia . on a microscopic scale , a deflagration propagates due to heat conduction by electrons .",
    "though the laminar flame speed in sne  ia is well known , the front has been found to be rayleigh - taylor ( rt ) unstable , increasing the effective speed of the burning front @xcite .",
    "more recently , significant progress has been made toward a better understanding of the physics of flames .",
    "starting from static wds , hydrodynamic calculations of the deflagration fronts have been performed in 2-d @xcite , and full 3-d @xcite .",
    "the calculations by @xcite demonstrated a complicated morphology for the burning front .",
    "plumes of burned material will fill a significant fraction of the wd , and unburned or partially - burned material can be seen near the center .",
    "thus iron - rich elements will not be confined to the central region as in 1-d models .",
    "@xcite finds that while the expansion of the envelope becomes almost spherical , the inhomogeneous chemical structure will fill about 50 to 70% of the star ( in mass ) .",
    "if a ddt occurs at densities needed to reproduce normal - bright sne  ia , most of the unburned fuel in these regions will be burned to iron - group elements during the detonation phase .",
    "this will eliminate the chemical inhomogeneities .",
    "however , in our subluminous model , the chemical structure imposed during the deflagration phase must be expected to survive because no or very little @xmath0 is produced during the detonation .    in order to test for this effect",
    ", we have mixed the inner layers of model 5p0z22.8 up to an expansion velocity of 8000 km  s@xmath11 .",

    "[ mix.may16 ] , a comparison is shown between the spectrum of sn1999by on may 16th , 1999 , and the synthetic spectrum about one week after maximum light , and problems with the spectral fit are apparent . as can be expected from the discussion above",
    ", the effective extension of the iron - rich layers to 8000 km  s@xmath11 causes the 1.5 to 1.8  blend to become rather strong , and line blanketing due to iron - group elements ( & ) become too strong in the region around 1 to 1.2 .",
    "moreover , at about 0.99 , 1.02 , 1.05 & 1.16 , ( absorption components ) strong blends can be seen due to ( 11302 , 11287 & 11297 ) , ( 11715 , 11745 , 13650 & 13650  ) , ( 9890 , 9931 , 9997 , 11839 & 11745  ) and ( 10455 & 108212  ) .",
    "we have to take into account that our approach assumes microscopic mixing whereas rt instabilities provide large scale inhomogeneities .",
    "if @xmath0 and the intermediate mass elements are separated , direct excitation of intermediate mass elements may be reduced . with respect to the radiation transport",
    ", the main difference is the covering factor .",
    "this will effect line blanketing and thus the line blanketing between 1 to 1.2 @xmath124 m may not pose a problem . however , the emission features between 1.5 to 1.8 @xmath124 m will not go away . the reduced excitation by non - thermal electrons and @xmath54 s in case of macroscopic mixing are important at low optical depths . less excitation may reduce the problem with the o , si , s & ca lines but the problem will no disappear because the corresponding features are formed close to the photosphere where the excitation is thermal in nature .    these problems strongly suggest that large scale mixing did not occur in sn  1999by .",
    "this may provide a key for our understanding of the nature of these objects .",
    "as previously discussed , the pre - conditioning of the wd before the explosion may provide a key for understanding the nature of subluminous sne  ia .",
    "such pre - conditioning may include the main sequence mass of the progenitor mass and its metallicity @xcite , the accretion history @xcite , or large - scale velocity fields such as turbulence prior to the runaway ( @xcite ) .",
    "up to now , none of these effects have been included in detailed 3-d calculations .",
    "therefore , the suggestions ( below ) require further investigation before taken as explanation .    beyond its subluminous nature ,",
    "sn  1999by showed another peculiarity with respect to normal - bright sne  ia .",
    "the observed polarization of sn  1999by was rather high ( @xmath129 ) with a well - defined axis of symmetry , whereas normal sne  ia show little or no polarization ( @xmath130 ; @xcite ) .",
    "> from a detailed analysis of the polarization spectra , @xcite concluded that the overall geometry of sn  1999by showed a large scale , probably rotational asymmetry of about 20% .",
    "the authors suggested several explanations . either",
    ", sn  1999by may be the result of the explosion of a rapidly rotating wd close to the break - up , or a result of a merger scenario . in",
    "a rapidly rotating wd , large - scale circulations @xcite might influence the deflagration phase of explosive burning , perhaps by breaking up large eddies and preventing their rise .",
    "alternatively , it should be remembered that the chemical structure of the exploding wd depends on the pre - expansion of the wd prior to the detonation phase .",
    "more precisely , we need to burn about @xmath131 to lift the wd in its gravitational potential .",
    "this mass is significantly more than is burned during the smoldering phase ( the phase of slow convective burning just prior to the explosion ) . even in the presence of strong turbulence ,",
    "the amount of burned material is much less ( @xmath132 , @xcite ) . in all models for the ignition ( e.g. @xcite )",
    ", the central temperature rises by non - explosive carbon burning during the last few minutes to hours before the runaway because the heat can not be dispersed .",
    "it may be feasible that large scale velocity fields due to rotation may extend this phase , and significantly increase the amount of burning prior to the explosion .",
    "thus , the pre - expansion in subluminous sne  ia may occur directly during the smoldering phase , and the deflagration phase may be even skipped , i.e. a detonation occurs promptly , and we may have a smoldering detonation model ( sd ) . in sd - models ,",
    "no @xmath0 is produced during the phase of pre - expansion and , consequently , this mechanism does not predict a lower limit for @xmath133 and , thus , @xmath89 . in principle , sd - models may be an attractive alternative also for normal - bright sne because they omit the need for a ddt but , from the present understanding of the runaway , in general , extensive burning prior to the runaway can not be expected ( see above ) . from the point of the spectral analysis ,",
    "this option is intriguing because burning during the smoldering phase precedes only to o and the time scales of burning are sufficient to completely homogenize the chemical structure of the wd .    finally , there is the question of alternative scenarios for sne  ia in the context of subluminous sne  ia .",
    "pure deflagrations of @xmath37-wds without any ddt may produce little @xmath134 but , according to current simulations , a large fraction of the wd would remain unburned .",
    "even if this problem were solved in the future , the problem of inhomogeneous chemistry and si - rich layers close to the center would remain .",
    "helium triggered detonations of sub - chandrasekhar mass wds have been suggested in the past . however , their distinct feature is an outer layer of @xmath0 above a low mass layer of explosive oxygen burning , a layer of incomplete si burning , and some @xmath0 close to the center .",
    "this chemical structure is in strong contradiction to the optical spectra and lcs of sn  1999by , and their evolution with time .    alternatively , setting aside the problem of triggering the explosion , central detonations in low - mass wds",
    "have been suggested in the past ( e.g. , @xcite ) . to produce little @xmath0 ,",
    "the explosion must occur in wds with central densities @xmath135 g @xmath64 which corresponds to @xmath136 .",
    "in contrast to the dd - models , these models would not show a lower limit for the @xmath0 production and @xmath89 , and they would avoid the problem of mixing during a deflagration phase . nonetheless , we regard these models as unlikely candidates for sn  1999by because there are a couple of severe problems beside the lack of a triggering mechanism for the explosion .",
    "the total mass of the ejecta is lower ( by a factor of 2 ) than is required to keep the line forming region in the layers of explosive carbon and incomplete si - burning up to two and four weeks after the explosion , respectively .",
    "the specific production of nuclear energy does not depend on @xmath137 .",
    "in this case , the diffusion time scales and , thus , the rise times to maximum light are @xmath138 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "compared to the lcs for a wd with @xmath37 , we expect rise times to be shorter by @xmath139 which is incompatible with sn  1999by observations .",
    "this leaves the merging scenario as an alternative as we may expect a significant asphericity in the explosion if the merging occurs on hydrodynamical time scales .",
    "nevertheless , this alternative is not a very attractive one .",
    "based on 1-d parameterized models , @xcite provided chemical structures for explosions which may resemble merger models . as a general feature ,",
    "these models show a shell - like structure with a massive outer layer of unburned c / o which encloses a thin , low mass layer of explosive carbon burning .",
    "this pattern is not consistent with the ir - spectra for sne  1999by up to maximum light .",
    "however , it should be kept in mind that , besides the limitations of 1-d models for mergers , no chemical structures are available for merging subluminous models . a more severe problem for mergers",
    "may be that merger models tend to ignite prematurely and produce a detonation wave that burns the c / o wd to a o / ne / mg wd prior to the completion of the merger .",
    "thus , merging may result in an accretion induced collapse rather than a sne  ia @xcite .",
    "ir - spectra of the subluminous sn1999by have been presented which cover the time evolution from about 4 days before to 2 weeks before maximum light .",
    "this is the first subluminous sn ia ( and arguably the first sn  ia ) for which ir spectra with good time coverage are available .",
    "these observations allowed us to determine the chemical structure of the sn envelope .",
    "based on a delayed detonation model , a self - consistent set of hydrodynamic explosions , light curves , and synthetic spectra have been calculated .",
    "this analysis has only two free parameters : the initial structure of the progenitor and the description of the nuclear burning front .",
    "the light curves and spectral evolution follow directly from the explosion model without any further tuning , thus providing a tight link between the model physics and the predicted observables .    by varying a single parameter ,",
    "the transition density at which detonation occurs , a set of models has been constructed which spans the observed brightness variation of type  ia supernovae .",
    "the absolute maximum brightness depends primarily on the @xmath0 production which , for dd - models , depends mainly on the transition density @xmath39 .",
    "the brightness - decline relation @xmath140 observed in sne  ia is also reproduced in these models . in the dd scenario",
    "this relation is a result of the temperature dependence of the opacity , or more precisely , as a consequence of the rapid drop in the opacities for temperatures less than about 7000 to 8000 k.    within @xmath37 wd models , a certain amount of burning during the deflagration phase is needed to pre - expand the wd and avoid burning the entire star to @xmath0 .",
    "this implies a lower limit for the @xmath0 mass of about @xmath141 @xmath142 and , consequently , implies a minimum brightness for sne  ia within this scenario .",
    "the best model for sn  1999by ( @xmath143  g  @xmath64 , selected by matching to the predicted and observed optical light curves ) is close to this minimum ni yield .",
    "the data are consistent with little or no interstellar reddening ( @xmath144 ) , and the derived distance is @xmath3  mpc or @xmath119  mpc if we take the limit for @xmath145 from the models or assume @xmath20 according @xcite for the galaxy .    without any further modification , this subluminous model has been used to analyse the ir - spectra from may 6 , may 10 , may 16 and may 24 , 1999 , which correspond to @xmath4  d , 0  d , + 7  d and + 14  d after maximum light . the photosphere ( @xmath146 ) recedes from 14000 , to 10500 , 6500 and 4000 km  s@xmath11 .",
    "the observed and theoretical spectra agree reasonably well with respect to the doppler shift of lines and all strong features could be identified .    before maximum light ,",
    "the spectra are dominated by products of about explosive carbon burning ( o , mg ) , and si . spectra taken at + 7  d and + 14  d after maximum are dominated by products of incomplete si burning . at about 2 weeks after maximum , the iron - group elements begin to show up",
    ". the long duration of the phases dominated by layers of explosive carbon burning and incomplete si burning implies massive layers of these burning stages that are comparable with our model results .",
    "( @xmath147 and @xmath148 for explosive carbon and incomplete silicon burning , respectively . )",
    "this , together with the @xmath0 mass , argues that sn  1999by was the explosion of a wd at or near the chandrasekhar mass .",
    "finally , we note that the observed ir spectra are at odds with recent 3-d calculations @xcite which predict that large scale chemical inhomogeneities filling 50  70% ( in mass ) of the wd will be formed during the deflagration phase .",
    "when the effect of such inhomogeneous mixing is tested by mixing the inner layers of our sn  1999by model , significant differences appear between the model spectra and the observed data .",
    "this suggests that no significant large - scale mixing took place in sn  1999by .",
    "the lack of observed mixing and the asphericity seen in sn  1999by may be important clues into the nature of subluminous sne  ia , and may be related to the reason for a low ddt transition density ( and hence the low luminosity ) .",
    "alternatively , we may have an extended smoldering phase of the wd prior to the explosion which skips the deflagration phase altogether ( see  5 ) .",
    "in either case , the pre - conditioning of the wd prior to the explosion seems to be a key for understanding sne  ia .",

    "<S> dd models require a minimum amount of burning during the deflagration phase which implies a lower limit for the @xmath0 mass of about @xmath1 and consequently a lower limit for the sn brightness . </S>",

    "<S> the data are consistent with little or no interstellar reddening ( @xmath2 ) and we derive a distance or @xmath3 mpc for sn  1999by in agreement with other estimates .    without any modification , </S>",
    "<S> the synthetic spectra from this subluminous model match reasonably well the observed ir spectra taken on may 6 , may 10 , may 16 and may 24 , 1999 . these dates correspond roughly to @xmath4  d , 0  d , and 6  d and 14  d after maximum light . prior to maximum , </S>",

    "<S> the implied distribution of elements in velocity space agrees well with the dd model predictions for a subluminous sn  ia . </S>",
    "<S> regardless of the explosion model , the long duration of the phases dominated by layers of explosive carbon and oxygen burning argues that sn  1999by was the explosion of a white dwarf at or near the chandrasekhar mass .    the good agreement between the observations and the models without fine - tuning a large number of free parameters suggests that dd models are a good description of at least subluminous type  ia sne . </S>",
    "<S> pure deflagration scenarios or mergers are unlikely and helium - triggered explosions can be ruled out . </S>",
    "<S> however , problems for dd models still remain , as the data seem to be at odds with recent 3-d models of the deflagration phase which predict significant mixing of the inner layers of the white dwarf prior to detonation . </S>",
    "<S> possible solutions include the effects of rapid rotation on the propagation of nuclear flames during the explosive phase of burning , or extensive burning of carbon just prior to the runaway . </S>"
