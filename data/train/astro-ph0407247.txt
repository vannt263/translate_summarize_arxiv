    "stars form in galaxies at hugely varying rates @xcite . the mechanisms that control the star formation rate from interstellar gas",

    "is regulated by radiative cooling and stellar and turbulent heating . despite this complexity ,",
    "star - forming spiral galaxies follow two empirical laws .",
    "first , stars only form above a critical gas surface density @xcite that appears to be determined by the @xcite criterion for gravitational instability .",
    "second , the rate of star formation is proportional to a power of the total gas surface density @xcite .",
    "a number of groups have simulated disk galaxies in isolation or in mergers , or in cosmological contexts , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "@xcite review this work .",
    "however , in these simulations , star formation is generally set up with empirical recipes _",
    "a priori_. the origin of the observed schmidt law remains unclear .",
    "recent cosmological simulations with moderate mass resolution by @xcite show that the schmidt law is a manifestation of the overall density distribution of the ism , and find little contribution from feedback .",
    "however , the strength of gravitational instability was not directly measured in his work , so a direct connection could not be made between instability and the schmidt law , as we do here .",
    "the importance of gravitational instability in controlling large - scale star formation was emphasized by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a similar conclusion comes from the observation that thin dust lanes in galaxies only form in gravitationally unstable regions @xcite .",
    "we simulate a large set of isolated galaxies to investigate gravitational instability and consequent star formation . in this letter",
    ", we examine star formation as a function of gravitational instability , and compare the global schmidt law and star formation thresholds derived from our simulations to the observations .",
    "we use the smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code gadget @xcite , modified to include absorbing sink particles @xcite to directly measure the mass of gravitationally collapsing gas . sink particles , representing star clusters ( scs ) , replace gravitationally bound regions of converging flow that reach number densities @xmath0  @xmath1 .",

    "we also set a minimum value of @xmath53 particles for lower mass galaxies resolved with fewer particles .",
    "to derive the schmidt law , we average @xmath54 and @xmath55 over the star forming region following @xcite , with radius chosen to encircle 80% of the mass in sinks . to estimate the star formation rate , we make the assumption that individual sinks represent dense molecular clouds that form stars at some efficiency .",
    "observations by @xcite suggest that the _ local _ star formation efficiency ( sfe ) in molecular clouds remains roughly constant .",
    "@xcite shows a median sfe of 30% in starburst galaxies dominated by molecular gas .",
    "this suggests the local sfe of dense molecular clouds around 30% .",
    "we therefore adopt a fixed local sfe of @xmath56 = 30% to convert the mass of sinks to stars . note",
    "that this local efficiency is different from the global star formation efficiency in galaxies , which measures the fraction of the _ total _ gas turned into stars .",

    ", our models with @xmath79 km s@xmath4 and gas fraction @xmath80 of the disk mass appear to be rather stable ( @xmath81 ) , with no star formation in the first 3 gyrs , while models with @xmath82 km s@xmath4 become less stable , forming stars easily .",
    "this is also consistent with the rotational velocity above which dust lanes are observed to form @xcite .",
    "we have deferred inclusion of explicit feedback , magnetic fields , and gas recycling to future work .",
    "however , we believe each will have minor effects on the questions considered here .",
    "the assumption of an isothermal equation of state for the gas implies substantial feedback to maintain the effective temperature of the gas against radiative cooling and turbulent dissipation .",
    "real interstellar gas has a wide range of temperatures .",
    "however , the rms velocity dispersion generally falls within the range 612 km s@xmath4 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "direct feedback from starbursts may play only a minor role in quenching subsequent star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , perhaps because most energy is deposited not in the disk but above it as superbubbles blow out ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite demonstrate that swing and magneto - jeans instabilities operating in a gaseous disk occur at @xmath72 , suggesting that magnetostatic support is unimportant .",
    "the lack of gas recycling both from disrupted molecular clouds and from massive stars will change the detailed patterns of star formation , but probably not the overall results .    simulations of isolated , isothermal disks by @xcite show large - scale collapse in their centers leading to disks far smaller than observed , which they argued was caused by an isothermal equation of state .",
    "this behavior does not occur in our model with physical parameters close to theirs , but resolution sufficient to resolve the jeans length .",
    "similarly , @xcite argue that several long - standing problems in galaxy simulations such as the angular momentum catastrophe may well be caused by inadequate resolution , or violation of the other numerical criteria",
    ". we will present more resolution studies in future work .    in summary ,",
    "our models reproduce quantitatively not only the schmidt law , but also the star formation threshold in disk galaxies .",
    "we find a direct correlation between the star formation rate and the strength of gravitational instability .",
    "this suggests that gravitational instability in effectively isothermal gas may be the dominant physical mechanism that controls the rate and location of star formation in galaxies .",
    "unstable galaxies were more common at early cosmic times , so our results , together with merger - induced starbursts @xcite may account for the butcher - oemler effect @xcite of increasing blueness of galaxies with redshift .",
    "massive galaxies form stars quickly , which may account for the downsizing effect that star formation first occurs in big galaxies at high redshift , while modern starburst galaxies are small ( @xcite ) .",
    "the slow evolution of star formation in our low mass models resembles that observed in low surface brightness galaxies @xcite .",
