    "the nonholonomic motion planning problem for a car towing trailers has been one of the most widely studied problems in nonlinear control theory during the last ten years .",
    "the controllability of this system was proved by  . since then",
    "many important results have been obtained , including solutions of the motion planning and stabilization problems  see the papers @xcite , the book @xcite , and references given there  with the main emphasis put on regular configurations . for singular configurations",
    "much less results are available , although it is clear that for some steering situations , like turning and going back in a narrow street , it is necessary to cross the singular locus .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show that theoretical results of @xcite can be applied to this problem .",
    "we illustrate the theory with a concrete example : the two - trailer system .",

    "we recall the nonholonomic model of a car towing trailers .",
    "then we show how to transform the @xmath0-trailer system into a kumpera - ruiz normal form and we prove a surprising result : any goursat structure is locally equivalent to the @xmath0-trailer system around a well chosen point of its configuration space .",
    "an alternative proof of this fact has been proposed by . in section  [ sec - motion - planning ] , we briefly discuss how transforming the @xmath0-trailer system to a kumpera - ruiz normal form simplifies the motion planning problem by reducing it to an algebraic problem of solving a system of polynomial equations .",

    "we call a coordinate @xmath227 such that @xmath228 a _ singular coordinate _ , and a coordinate  @xmath227 such that @xmath229 a _ regular coordinate_. it follows from the proof of theorem  [ ieee - thm - kumpera - ruiz ]  see @xcite and @xcite  that for all singular coordinates we have @xmath230 ; but for regular coordinates , the constants @xmath231 can be arbitrary real numbers .    to prove the theorem , we will define a point @xmath4 of @xmath145 whose coordinates @xmath232 satisfy @xmath233 , where @xmath170 and @xmath234 denote the coordinates used in the proof of theorem [ thm - trailer - conversion ] . first , put the axle of the last trailer at @xmath235 and take @xmath236 .",

    "defined construction , this normal form has the same singularities as  @xmath219 and is defined around the same point of @xmath202 ( if we translate the coordinates in order to center them then these kumpera - ruiz normal forms have the same constants in the regular prolongations ) .",
    "hence , the diffeomorphism @xmath252 gives the claimed equivalence .",
    "as we have proved in section  [ sec - nilpotentization ] , the lie algebras generated by kumpera - ruiz normal forms are nilpotent .",
    "this property is fundamental because it allows to solve the nonholonomic motion planning problem in the case of goursat structures .",
    "but kumpera - ruiz normal forms have also an other interesting property : they are `` triangular ''  in the sense of , see also @xcite .",
    "indeed , it follows directly from their construction that they give a control system @xmath253 that can be written  see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , after a permutation of the @xmath254 s , in the following form : @xmath47{lcl}\\dot x_{1 } & = & u_{1}\\\\ \\dot x_{2 } & = & u_{2}\\\\ \\dot x_{3 } & = & f_{3}(x_{1},x_{2})\\,u_{2}\\\\ & \\vdots & \\\\",

    "therefore , if we take polynomial controls of the form @xmath47{l}u_{1}(t)=a_{0}+a_{1}t+\\cdots+a_{n-2}t^{n-2}\\\\ u_{2}(t)=b_{0 } , \\end{array } \\label{nice - controls}\\ ] ] as it has been proposed in @xcite in order to steer the @xmath0-trailer around regular points , then the control system @xmath257 can be integrated by successive quadratures , which leads to a system of @xmath0 polynomial equations @xmath258 where , for @xmath259 , the @xmath260 s are polynomial functions of all their arguments and the vectors @xmath261 and @xmath262 denote the initial and final configuration , respectively . hence , for goursat structures , the nonholonomic motion planning problem can be transformed into an algebraic problem : the resolution of a system of polynomial equations .    in the regular case , the polynomial system ( [ polynomial - system ] )",
    "is actually a linear system , which reflects the flatness of the system around regular configurations . indeed ,",
    "if we fix @xmath263 then the final condition @xmath262 belongs to a hyperplane @xmath264 of  @xmath34 , parameterized by the constants @xmath265 , and the motion planning problem leads to the resolution of a full - rank system of linear equations .",
    "note , however , that this approach fails if @xmath266 .",
    "that is , when the control  ( [ nice - controls ] ) produces an abnormal trajectory .    in the singular case ,",
    "the system ( [ polynomial - system ] ) is truly polynomial , which causes at least two problems .",
    "firstly , in general , it can not be solved explicitly and we must use numerical approximations . secondly , although the system is globally controllable , there may be restrictions on the set of points accessible with controls of the form ( [ nice - controls ] ) and , in general , describing these restrictions leads to another system of polynomial equations .",
    "fortunately , in small dimension the situation is not so complicated . indeed , if we consider a mobile robot towing two or three trailers then ( [ polynomial - system ] ) leads to a system of linear equations together with a single quadratic equation , which can be solved easily , and therefore the nonholonomic motion planning problem admits an explicit solution .",
    "moreover , the set of points accessible by the family of controls ( [ nice - controls ] ) can be completely characterized : if we fix all initial and final angles , the set of points in the @xmath267-plane that can be reached from a given configuration is delimited by a parabola .",
    "the results presented in this paper can be directly applied to the mobile robot towing two trailers , which is given by @xmath47{l}\\dot\\xi_{1}=\\cos(\\theta_{2}-\\theta_{1})\\cos(\\theta_{1}-\\theta_{0})\\cos ( \\theta_{0})v_{2}\\\\ \\dot\\xi_{2}=\\cos(\\theta_{2}-\\theta_{1})\\cos(\\theta_{1}-\\theta_{0})\\sin ( \\theta_{0})v_{2}\\\\ \\dot\\theta_{0}=\\cos(\\theta_{2}-\\theta_{1})\\sin(\\theta_{1}-\\theta_{0})v_{2}\\\\ \\dot\\theta_{1}=\\sin(\\theta_{2}-\\theta_{1})v_{2}\\\\ \\dot\\theta_{2}=v_{1}. \\end{array}\\ ] ] we will consider this system in a small enough neighborhood of the singular locus @xmath268 , where the transformation @xmath269{l } x_{1 } = \\xi_{1}\\\\ x_{2 } = \\xi_{2}\\\\ x_{3 } = \\tan(\\theta_{0})\\\\ x_{4 } = \\sec(\\theta_{0})^{3}\\tan(\\theta_{1}-\\theta_{0})\\\\ x_{5 } = \\tfrac{\\cos(\\theta_{0})^{4}\\cos(\\theta_{1}-\\theta_{0})\\cos ( \\theta_{2}-\\theta_{1})}{3\\tan(\\theta_{0})\\tan(\\theta_{1}-\\theta_{0})\\sin(\\theta_{1}-\\theta_{0})\\cos(\\theta_{2}-\\theta_{1})+\\sec(\\theta_{1}-\\theta_{0})^{2}\\left (   \\sin(\\theta_{2}-\\theta_{1})-\\sin(\\theta_{1}-\\theta _ { 0})\\cos(\\theta_{2}-\\theta_{1})\\right )   } \\end{array}\\ ] ] converts the two - trailer into the following kumpera - ruiz normal form : @xmath47{l}\\dot x_{1}=x_{5}\\,u_{2}\\\\ \\dot x_{2}=x_{5}x_{3}\\,u_{2}\\\\ \\dot x_{3}=x_{5}x_{4}\\,u_{2}\\\\ \\dot x_{4}=u_{2}\\\\ \\dot x_{5}=u_{1}. \\end{array}\\ ] ] the feedback transformation between the old and new controls is given in the matlab file ` system.m ` of , which is available by e - mail request to the first author .",
