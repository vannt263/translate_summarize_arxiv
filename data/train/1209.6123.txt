    "unsaturated point - spread function ( psf ) stars were selected within a 1 radius of w1639 , and used to create an initial model psf .",
    "this was used to fit and subtract all identified stars within the image . in many cases this reveals the presence of companion stars within the haloes of psf stars . identifying these stars and including them in the psf analysis on a second pass allowed us to iterate towards an `` uncontaminated '' psf , which was then used to fit and subtract the bright star 2m1639 .",

    "our fourstar astrometric observations on the night of 2012 july 10 were processed on - the - fly using oracdr , to obtain a precise position angle and separation at this epoch between the bright source 2m1639 and the faint source w1639 .",
    "fire was rotated to this position angle , and 2m1639 positioned on the slit , ensuring that w1639 would also be acquired down the slit .",
    "six 600s exposures were obtained nodding the slit by 10  in an abba pattern .",
    "these spectra were then processed in a standard fashion , using arc lines to remove fire s optical curvature and traces of the bright star 2m1639 to remove a slight tilt of the spectra with respect to the detector rows .",
    "images were pair subtracted and combined to produce a pair of a - b and b - a images , and these then had any residual sky extracted and subtracted .",
    "the resulting images are dominated by flux from the bright source 2m1639 , together with much fainter emission from w1639 ( which is offset by + 9.2 pixels in the fire data ) .",
    "the expected spectrum of a very - late - t or y dwarf can be seen nonetheless in this data ( see fig . [ extraction ] - _ upper panel _ ) . to remove the contaminating flux due to the bright companion",
    ", we implemented a `` spectral psf '' subtraction using custom scripts in the perl data language .",
    "we extracted spatial profiles from the spectra by averaging every 100 pixels in the spectral direction , and fitting a model psf to the resulting spatial profile  after much experimentation we settled on a gaussian model for the core of the spectral psf , a moffat function for its wings , and we also allowed for a `` companion '' gaussian ( with the same width as the core ) at the spatial separation known between w1639 and 2m1639 , but with an amplitude allowed to float as a free parameter .",
    "we found that even this model , however , left systematic residuals when subtracted , and so we followed the lead of daophot @xcite and allowed for an empirical look - up table of residuals as a fraction of the total peak height of the spectral psf .",
    "the free parameters for the spectral psf were then fitted with quadratic polynomials to generate a model psf that varied smoothly with wavelength .",
    "this psf ( minus the `` companion '' terms that modelled w1639 ) was then generated , normalised to each column of the image , and subtracted to create a `` cleaned '' spectral image ( see fig .",
    "[ extraction ] - _ lower panel _ ) .",
    "spectra were then extracted from this image , wavelength calibrated and averaged over the a - b and b - a beams to produce a final extracted spectrum ( see fig . [ extracted ] ) .    despite the considerable care with which we removed the 5 magnitudes brighter spectrum of 2m1639 , fig . [ extracted ] indicates that there is nonetheless some contaminating 2m1639 flux still present in the extracted spectrum .",
    "this is demonstrated by the flux seen in the extracted spectrum at 1.36 - 1.4@xmath3 m  very cool brown dwarfs emit essentially _ zero _ flux at these wavelengths , and they _ certainly _ do nt show sharp atmospheric absorption at 1.36@xmath3 m .",
    "the spectrum of 2m1639 does , however , show such a feature and a scaled version of that spectrum ( shown in the figure ) is an excellent match to the `` baseline '' flux present in the extracted spectrum .",
    "we are therefore confident that removing the scaled 2m1639 spectrum , as shown , is required to generate a decontaminated spectrum of w1639 .",
    "this decontaminated spectrum was then binned by a factor of 3 ( to match spectral pixels to the fire resolution in this wavelength range ) and a telluric star correction applied to remove atmospheric absorption as well as place our spectra on an f@xmath28 scale .",
    "the final spectrum is shown in figure [ types ] .",
    "we then follow the procedure outlined in @xcite , and rank the relative lateness of w1639 against other y dwarfs using a comparison of spectra scaled by the flux peak in the j - band .",
    "w1639 is clearly seen to have a j - band peak narrower than that of the t9 prototype ugps0722 , and itself has a j - band peak significantly broader than that of the y1 prototype wise0350 .",

    "@xcite derived the median v@xmath32 and @xmath33 values for the closely related t dwarf population to be 31kms@xmath1  and 20kms@xmath1  ( respectively ) , suggesting that w1639 is kinematically deviant from brown dwarfs with ages typical of the field population ( 3 - 5 gyr ) .",

    "these observations have shown , once again , that methane filters have significant utility in the follow - up of large surveys for cool brown dwarfs  the use of imaging permits the sort of differential analysis that can identify y dwarfs even when they lie quite close to bright background stars , while the unique methane signature provides an unambiguous means of identifying very cool photospheres . moreover , we have shown that methane filters placed in the near - infrared j band ( as installed in fourstar ) can be very powerful for observations of the coolest brown dwarfs . at very cold temperatures ,",
