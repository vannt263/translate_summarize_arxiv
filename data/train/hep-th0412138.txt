    "exact solutions to einstein equations are extremely useful , specially if they describe simple yet physically attainable systems .",
    "indeed , take for example the famous schwarzschild metric : with this exact solution at hand , describing the geometry outside a spherically symmetric distribution of matter , one was able to compute the deflection of light as it passes near the sun ( and to match the theoretical prediction against the observational data ) , thereby giving a strong support to einstein s theory .",
    "we now know that the outside geometry of many astrophysical objects is well described by the schwarzschild metric , and we can start studying them by investigating the properties of this metric .",
    "one of the most important things that one should study first is the classical stability of a given solution .",
    "in fact , if a solution is not stable , then it will most certainly not be found in nature , unless the instability timescale is much larger than the age of our universe .",
    "what does one mean by stability ?",
    "in this classical context , stability means that a given initially bounded perturbation of the spacetime remains bounded for all times .",
    "for example , the schwarzschild spacetime is stable against all kinds of perturbations , massive or massless @xcite .",
    "thus , the schwarzschild geometry is indeed appropriate to study astrophysical objects . on the other hand the kerr spacetime ,",
    "describing a rotating black hole , is stable against massless field perturbations but not against massive bosonic fields @xcite ( although the instability timescale is typically much larger than the age of the universe , thus presenting no real danger ) . in four dimensional ( asymptotically flat ) spacetime ,",
    "the kerr - newman family is the most general black hole solution to einstein equations , and , if we exclude massive bosons , they are all stable . however , unstable solutions seem to be more common than previously thought .",
    "take for example anti - de sitter ( ads ) spacetimes .",
    "this has become a very popular background spacetime since it was conjectured @xcite that there is a duality between the gravitational degrees of freedom in the bulk of ads space and a conformal field theory formulated on the boundary of that space ; this is the ads / cft correspondence conjecture . a black hole in this spacetime corresponds to a thermal state on the cft .",
    "are ads black holes stable ? not all , as shown recently by cardoso and dias @xcite , who have proved that small kerr - ads black holes are classically unstable .",
    "this instability is due to a `` black hole bomb '' effect @xcite , whereby waves are successively amplified near the black hole event horizon and reflected at the boundary of the ads spacetime ( the special thing about ads spacetime is that its boundaries , spatial infinity , works as a wall ) .",
    "if we now consider higher dimensional spacetimes , which are of interest to string theory and/or extra dimensional scenarios , instabilities seem to be much more common .",
    "for instance , even though higher dimensional schwarzschild black holes @xcite are stable @xcite , their rotating counterparts seem not to be , at least for large rotation .",
    "indeed , it was proved by gregory and laflamme @xcite that black branes are classically unstable against a sector of gravitational perturbations ( the tensorial sector ) , and this result was used recently by emparan and myers @xcite to argue that ultra - spinning higher dimensional black holes should be similarly unstable ( recall @xcite that for spacetime dimensions @xmath0 greater than 5 , @xmath1 , there is no limit on the rotation parameter ) . recently",
    "cardoso and lemos @xcite have uncovered a new universal instability for rotating black branes and strings , which holds for any massless field perturbation .",
    "the gist of their argument is that transverse dimensions in a black brane geometry act as an effective mass for the fields , which simulates a mirror enclosing a rotating black hole , thereby creating a black hole bomb @xcite .",
    "for other types of instabilities see for example @xcite .    here",
    ", we shall investigate the stability against scalar perturbations of ultra - spinning black holes . in four and five dimensions",
    ", there is an upper bound for the rotation parameter @xmath2 of a kerr black hole @xcite , and when the black hole saturates that bound we say it is an extremal black hole .",
    "now , it is known @xcite that the characteristic frequencies ( quasinormal frequencies , or qn frequencies ) of four or five dimensional kerr black holes always have a negative imaginary part ( the field is decomposed according to @xmath3 ) so the kerr spacetime is stable .",
    "however , as the black hole approaches extremality , the imaginary part of the qn frequency tends to zero , thus raising the possibility that if there was no upper bound on @xmath2 the qn frequencies could have a positive imaginary part , or in other words , the spacetime could be unstable .",
    "this will be our main motivation for this study .",
    "we are not studying tensorial perturbations , so we shall not be dealing with gregory - laflamme type of instabilities .",
    "instead , we are more interested in finding out what are the consequences , if any , of having arbitrarily large angular momentum for a black hole .",
    "we shall focus , for concreteness , on six - dimensional rotating black holes , but we suspect that the general features born out of this study are valid for any spacetime dimension greater than five .",
    "previous work on related subject includes that of ida _ et al _ @xcite and berti _ et al _ @xcite who studied five dimensional kerr black holes , in large and compact extra dimensions respectively .",
    "as we remarked , in five dimensions there is a bound on the rotation of the black hole , and thus these works are not suitable for studying possibly new phenomena appearing for unbound rotation parameter .",
    "here we adopt the notation of ida et al @xcite , and we also correct some typos appearing in their equations . in four dimensions , there is only one possible rotation axis for a cylindrically symmetric spacetime , and there is therefore only one angular momentum parameter . in higher dimensions",
    "there are several choices of rotation axis and there is a multitude of angular momentum parameters , each referring to a particular rotation axis @xcite . here",
    "we shall concentrate on the simplest case , for which there is only one angular momentum parameter , which we shall denote by @xmath2 .",
    "the metric of a @xmath4-dimensional kerr black hole with only one non - zero angular momentum parameter is given in boyer - lindquist - type coordinates by @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 denotes the standard metric of the unit @xmath8-sphere .",
    "this metric describes a rotating black hole in asymptotically flat , vacuum space - time with mass and angular momentum proportional to @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "hereafter , @xmath11 are assumed .",
    "the event horizon is located at @xmath12 , such that @xmath13 , which is homeomorphic to @xmath14 . for @xmath15 , the standard 4-dimensional case ,",
    "an event horizon exists only for @xmath16 .",
    "when @xmath17 , an event horizon exists only when @xmath18 , and the event horizon shrinks to zero - area in the extreme limit @xmath19 .",
    "on the other hand , when @xmath20 , which is the part of the parameter space which we shall focus on , @xmath21 has exactly one positive root for arbitrary @xmath22 .",
    "this means there is no bound on @xmath2 , and thus there are no extreme kerr black holes in higher dimensions .",
    "consider now the evolution of a massless scalar field @xmath23 in the background described by ( [ metric ] ) .",
    "the evolution is governed by the curved space klein - gordon equation ( g^)=0 , [ klein ] where @xmath24 is the determinant of the metric .",
    "the metric appearing in ( [ klein ] ) should describe the geometry referring to both the black hole and the scalar field , but if we consider that the amplitude of @xmath23 is so small that its contribution to the energy content can be neglected , than the kerr metric ( [ metric ] ) should be a good approximation to @xmath25 in ( [ klein ] ) .",
    "we shall thus work in this perturbative approach .",
    "it turns out that it is possible to simplify considerably equation ( [ klein ] ) if we separate the angular variables from the radial and time variables , as is done in four dimensions @xcite .",
    "this separation was accomplished , for higher dimensions , in @xcite for five dimensional kerr holes ( who work with two spin parameters ) and also in @xcite for a general @xmath26-dimensional kerr hole .",
    "since we are considering only one angular momentum parameter , the separation is somewhat simplified , and we can follow @xcite . in the end",
    "our results agree with the results in @xcite , if we consider only one angular momentum parameter in their equations .",
    "we consider the ansatz @xmath27 , and substitute this form in ( [ klein ] ) , where @xmath28 are hyperspherical harmonics on the @xmath8-sphere , with eigenvalues given by @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) .",

    "( [ rad ] ) .",
    "in other words , the waves must be purely ingoing at the horizon and purely outgoing at the infinity .",
    "for assigned values of the rotational parameter @xmath2 and of the angular index @xmath36 there is a discrete ( and infinite ) set of frequencies called quasinormal frequencies , qn frequencies or @xmath37 , satisfying the wave equation ( [ rad ] ) with the boundary conditions just specified by eq .",
    "( [ bound2 ] ) .",
    "the qn frequencies are in general complex numbers , the imaginary part describing the decay or growth of the perturbation , because the time dependence is given by @xmath38 .",
    "we expect the black hole to be stable against small perturbations , and therefore @xmath37 is expected to have a positive imaginary part , so that the perturbation decays exponentially as time goes by ( recall that the time dependence of the wavefunction is @xmath39 ) .",
    "as usual , we will order the qn frequencies @xmath37 according to the absolute value of their imaginary part : the fundamental mode ( labeled by an integer @xmath15 ) will have the smallest imaginary part ( in modulus ) , and so on .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and @xcite for further details on qn frequencies .",
    "now that we have a well posed problem , we have to solve for the characteristic qn frequencies . the most powerful method to date",
    "is that of leaver @xcite , which makes use of a continued fraction representation , and which can determine the resonant frequency @xmath40 and the separation constant @xmath41 with very high accuracy .",
    "we assume the following series expansion for @xmath42 @xmath43 which automatically satisfies the regular boundary conditions at @xmath44 whenever converges . substituting this into eq .",
    "( [ ang ] ) , we obtain the three - term recurrence relations @xmath45 where @xmath46 here , we have defined the dimensionless quantity @xmath47 and @xmath48 , since the behavior of the system depends only on @xmath49 . when @xmath50 , the eigenvalue @xmath41 is explicitly determined from the requirement that the series expansion ends within finite terms , since otherwise divergent .",
    "thus we have @xmath51 and the 0th - order eigenfunctions are given in terms of the jacobi polynomials : @xmath52    in a similar way , for the @xmath53 case , we expand the radial function @xmath54 into the form @xmath55 where @xmath56 is taken to be @xmath57 . if @xmath58 , the expansion coefficients @xmath59 in equation ( [ radepd ] ) are determined via the seven - term recurrence relation ( it s just a matter of substituting expression ( [ radepd ] ) in the wave equation ( [ rad ] ) ) , given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 \\ , , \\nonumber \\\\ % \\tilde\\eta_k&=&(1+a^2)^2\\,(-3+k+i\\sigma)^2 \\ , .",
    "\\nonumber % \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by making a gaussian elimination four times , one can reduce the seven - term recurrence relations ( [ seven ] ) to the three - term recurrence relations , which is given by @xmath62 for more details on how to obtain the coefficients of the three - term recurrence relation , we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "an eigenfunction satisfying the qn mode ( qnm ) boundary conditions behaves at the event horizon and infinity as eq .",
    "( [ bound2 ] ) .",
    "therefore , one can see that the expanded wave function ( [ radepd ] ) satisfies the qnm boundary conditions if the expansion in ( [ radepd ] ) converges at spatial infinity .",
    "this convergence condition for the expansion ( [ radepd ] ) , namely the qnm conditions , can be written in terms of the continued fraction as @xcite @xmath63 where the first equality is a notational definition commonly used in the literature for infinite continued fractions . here",
    ", we shall adopt such a convention .",
    "as for the determination of the separation constant @xmath41 , exactly the same technique of the continued fraction can be applied . the continued fraction equation for the separation",
    "constant is then given by @xmath64 in order to obtain the qnms , one has to solve numerically the two coupled algebraic equations ( [ a - eq ] ) and ( [ b - eq ] ) , following for example the procedure in @xcite .",
    "using the method described above , we have made an extensive search for the qn frequencies of six - dimensional rotating black holes , for several values of the parameters @xmath36 .",
    "the numerical results are summarized in table [ tab:1 ] and in figs .",
    "[ fig : inst1]-[fig : inst2 ] . to check our code",
    "we have first computed the qn frequencies of six - dimensional schwarzschild black holes , and compared them with analytic wkb results @xcite .",
    "the results are shown in table [ tab:1 ] , along with a computation of the error involved in the wkb calculation .",
    ".[tab:1 ] in this table we compare our numerical results for the qn frequencies of six - dimensional , non - rotating black holes , with results obtained through wkb techniques , and we also indicate the error involved using the wkb approach .",
    "the results refer to the fundamental mode of several @xmath65 perturbations . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have investigated numerically the stability of six - dimensional rotating kerr black holes , with one rotation parameter .",
    "our results suggest that this geometry is stable against scalar field perturbations , even if the black hole is ultra - spinning .",
    "we thus rule out the possible existence of a new kind of instability for higher dimensional , ultra - spinning black holes",
    ". it would be interesting to check numerically or analytically the conjecture in @xcite , stating that ultra - spinning black holes should be unstable against gravitational perturbations ( more specifically , they suggest that the gregory - laflamme @xcite instability should be the cause ) .",
    "this , for the moment , is a major challenge specially because there is no known formalism to handle gravitational perturbations of higher dimensional kerr black holes .",
    "such a formalism could also prove useful in studying at depth the recently discovered instability for rotating black branes and strings @xcite .",
