    "<S> the lagrange mesh method is a very simple procedure to accurately solve eigenvalue problems starting from a given nonrelativistic or semirelativistic two - body hamiltonian with local or nonlocal potential . </S>",
    "<S> we show in this work that it can be applied to solve the inverse problem , namely , to find the equivalent local potential starting from a particular bound state wave function and the corresponding energy . in order to check the method </S>",
    "<S> , we apply it to several cases which are analytically solvable : the nonrelativistic harmonic oscillator and coulomb potential , the nonlocal yamaguchi potential and the semirelativistic harmonic oscillator . the potential is accurately computed in each case . in particular , our procedure deals efficiently with both nonrelativistic and semirelativistic kinematics . </S>"
