    "in this _ letter _ we examine the power spectrum and the bispectrum for numerical simulations of the @xmath3 scale free model and cold dark matter ( cdm ) model . the power spectrum",
    "@xmath4 is the most fundamental statistic for a random field and the only statistic for a gaussian field .",
    "the cosmological distribution of matter , however , is not gaussian , and higher order statistics are also important .",
    "the lowest - order non - gaussian information is encoded in the bispectrum @xmath5 . in analogy to @xmath4 , which is the fourier transform of the two - point correlation function @xmath6 ,",
    "the bispectrum is the fourier transform of the three - point correlation function @xmath7 .",
    "the power spectrum @xmath4 of matter fluctuations is related to the mass density field @xmath8 in @xmath9-space by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the dirac delta - function .",
    "the bispectrum @xmath5 , similarly , is related to @xmath12 by @xmath13 .    on sufficiently large length scales ,",
    "density fluctuations are small enough that perturbation theory for gravitational instability suffices , and the predictions for the correlation functions can be computed in detail . to linear order ,",
    "the fluctuation amplitude @xmath14 grows by an overall scale factor , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the amplitude at some early time @xmath17 and @xmath18 is a growing function of time . in a nonlinear theory ,",
    "interactions generate a sum of terms to all orders in the initial amplitude , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 . even for a gaussian initial distribution ,",
    "these nonlinear terms induce nonvanishing higher order correlations . in perturbation theory , the lowest order two - point statistic is the linear power spectrum @xmath21 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "for the three - point statistic , the first nonvanishing contribution ( i.e. tree - level ) to the bispectrum is related to @xmath22 by @xmath23 where @xmath24 ( fry 1984 ) .",
    "for @xmath25 the factors @xmath26 and @xmath27 become @xmath28 , where for @xmath29 near 1@xmath30 in an open universe and @xmath31 in a flat universe with cosmological constant ( bouchet et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "equation  ( [ btree ] ) indicates that the main dependence on the power spectrum can be removed if one defines the hierarchical three - point amplitude @xmath32 the three - point amplitude @xmath0 has the convenient feature that for the lowest nonvanishing result in perturbation theory ( eq .  [ [ btree ] ] ) , @xmath33 is independent of time and the overall amplitude of @xmath22 . moreover , for scale - free models with a power - law @xmath34 , @xmath33 is independent of overall scale as well . in a pure hierarchical model , @xmath0 is exactly constant .",
    "the bispectrum @xmath35 and the three - point amplitude @xmath0 depend on any three parameters that define a triangle in @xmath9-space . for simplicity",
    ", we will use equilateral triangles to explore scale dependence .",
    "we have examined several other configurations and found behavior similar to the equilateral case . for a closed equilateral triangle , one has @xmath36 and @xmath37 , and the bispectrum @xmath38 depends only on the single wavenumber @xmath9 .",
    "to lowest order , the equilateral bispectrum has a particularly simple form , @xmath39 , and it follows from equation  ( [ qdef ] ) that @xmath40 , independent of the power spectrum .",
    "since @xmath35 has dimensions of @xmath41 , it is convenient to define a new dimensionless variable , which we name @xmath42 , to characterize the three - point statistic of mass density fluctuations . following the familiar density variance @xmath43 for the two - point statistic , we define @xmath42 for equilateral triangles as @xmath44 and it follows that @xmath45 .",
    "since @xmath46 is simply a constant to the lowest nonvanishing order in perturbation theory , this new statistic also has the convenient property that the leading order @xmath47 and @xmath48 have identical shapes , i.e. , @xmath49 .",
    "the leading - order perturbative expressions given above are valid for @xmath50 , or at low @xmath9 . including the next - to - leading order terms for the bispectrum",
    "extends the range of validity to the quasilinear regime @xmath51 ( scoccimarro et al .",
    "1998 ) . numerical simulations , however , are required in order to determine the fully evolved bispectrum of mass density fluctuations into the deeply nonlinear regime at high @xmath9 .",
    "we examine results from two cosmological simulations , an @xmath2 scale - free model and a cold dark matter ( cdm ) model .",
    "the @xmath2 simulation has @xmath52 particles and a plummer force softening length of @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the box length .",
    "this is the highest resolution simulation of an @xmath2 model to our knowledge .",
    "it is also the main simulation used in the study of self - similar scaling of the power spectrum by jain & bertschinger ( 1998 ) .",
    "the cdm model is critically flat with matter density @xmath55 and cosmological constant @xmath56 .",
    "this run has @xmath57 particles and is performed in a @xmath58 comoving box with a comoving force softening length of @xmath59 for hubble parameter @xmath60 .",
    "the baryon fraction is set to zero for simplicity .",
    "the primordial power spectrum has a spectral index of @xmath61 , and the density fluctuations are drawn from a random gaussian distribution .",
    "the gravitational forces are computed with a particle - particle particle - mesh ( p@xmath62 m ) code ( ferrell & bertschinger 1994 ) .",
    "we compute the density field @xmath12 on a grid from particle positions using the second - order triangular - shaped cloud ( tsc ) interpolation scheme .",
    "a fast fourier transform is then used to obtain @xmath12 in @xmath9-space .",
    "the @xmath9-space tsc window function is deconvolved to correct for smearing in real space due to the interpolation , and shot noise terms are subtracted to correct for discreteness effects .",
    "figure  1 illustrates the behavior of the nonlinear power spectrum @xmath63 and the three - point statistics @xmath64 and @xmath65 for equilateral triangular configurations for the @xmath2 scale - free simulation .",
    "three time outputs are shown , and the results are plotted against scaled @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is defined by @xmath68 , and the expansion factor @xmath69 is 1 initially .",
    "unlike the two - point @xmath70 , for which self - similar scaling works well ( jain & bertschinger 1998 ) , the three - point curves in the plot do not overlap ; self - similarity therefore does not hold as rigorously for the three - point function in the simulations .",
    "the slope of @xmath0 also has a weak dependence on time .",
    "for the last output ( @xmath71 , @xmath72 ) , @xmath0 increases monotonically with @xmath9 down to the resolution limit with an approximate logarithmic slope of @xmath73 . the next - to - leading order perturbative results for @xmath0 ( scoccimarro et al .",
    "1998 ) roughly agree with the most weakly evolved , ( @xmath74 , @xmath75 ) output up to @xmath76 , but not at higher @xmath9 nor in the later outputs .",
    "the upturn of @xmath77 at high @xmath9 ( dotted portion of curves in fig .",
    "1 ) is related to the downturn in @xmath70 at the same @xmath9 , which is likely due to limited numerical resolution .",
    "many earlier papers did not report this behavior ( e.g. , efstathiou et al .  1988 ; fry , melott , & shandarin 1993 ; scoccimarro et al .",
    "some of the computations were not carried out to sufficiently high wavenumbers to provide a clear test of the hierarchical model .",
    "others ( e.g. scoccimarro et al .",
    "1998 ) _ assumed _ self - similarity and averaged results over different time outputs , treating each output as if it were from an independent realization .",
    "we have checked for possible numerical artifacts by re - examining the @xmath2 results of fry et al .",
    "( 1993 ) from @xmath57 particle - mesh ( pm ) simulations . at evolution stages comparable to those in figure  1 ( i.e. @xmath78 , 16 , and 8) , we find that @xmath77 in four different random realizations agrees well with figure  1 up to the resolution limit of the pm runs .",
    "departures from the hierarchical model have been suggested in several papers that have examined the real - space three - point function ( suto & matsubara 1994 ) and the skewness @xmath79 ( e.g. , lahav et al .  1993 ; colombi et al .",
    "1996 ) , a volume integral average of the full three - point function .",
    "the simulations used in these papers had @xmath80 particles and a smaller dynamic range , so the results were limited to lower @xmath9 .",
    "the skewness is also a less powerful probe of hierarchical clustering than the full three - point examined here because the volume integral might average out non - hierarchical signals .",
    "in this section we examine analytical models that can be used to elucidate the numerical results of figure  1 .",
    "we suggest that the key to a better understanding of @xmath0 in the high-@xmath9 regime lies in the connection between @xmath0 and the density profiles of dark matter halos .",
    "this is because the contributions to @xmath0 at high @xmath9 are dominated by close particle triplets , many of which are located within individual halos of size @xmath81 .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to expect the two- and three - point correlation functions on small length scales to reflect the density profiles of dark matter halos .",
    "sheth and jain ( 1997 ) have examined how the amplitude of the two - point function is related to simple halo profiles .",
    "our emphasis here is on the link between the shape of the three - point function and halo profiles .",
    "one simple way to demonstrate the relation between halos and the correlation functions is to consider the `` power law cluster '' model . in this model",
    ", matter is distributed in randomly placed halos with a power - law mass density profile @xmath82 out to some radius @xmath83 ( peebles 1974 ; 1980 ) . for @xmath84 and @xmath85",
    ", one can derive analytically that the two - point function @xmath86 , the density variance @xmath70 , the three - point function @xmath87 , and @xmath0 scale as @xmath88 this model is clearly simplistic because in realistic cosmological models , the centers of dark matter halos are not randomly distributed , the halo density profile is not a pure power law , and not all mass is located within the halos .",
    "equation  ( [ epsilon ] ) nonetheless provides valuable insight into the link between the shape of dark matter halos and the high-@xmath9 behavior of the two- and three - point clustering statistics .    to test the applicability of equation  ( [ epsilon ] ) in a more realistic setting ,",
    "we have performed a series of experiments with dark matter halos identified in cosmological @xmath1-body simulations . in these experiments ,",
    "we keep the centers and masses of the halos unchanged but redistribute the subset of particles which lies within the virial radius ( the radius within which @xmath89 ) of each halo according to @xmath90 for a chosen @xmath91 .",
    "we then recompute @xmath70 and @xmath92 from the particle positions .",
    "this recipe allows us to explore simple density profiles while preserving the actual halo - halo spatial correlations , the halo mass distribution , and the correlation signal from non - halo particles in the simulations .",
    "figure  2 compares the results for the original output in the @xmath2 scale - free simulation with the results for replaced power - law halos .",
    "figure  3 does the same for the @xmath55 cdm simulation . as indicated , when the halo profiles obey @xmath90 , we find that @xmath70 and @xmath0 at high @xmath9 are well approximated by power laws , and that the slopes are indeed related to @xmath91 according to equation  ( [ epsilon ] ) . for @xmath93 ( i.e. an isothermal density distribution ) , for example ,",
    "both figures  2 and 3 show that @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "figure  3 also verifies equation  ( [ epsilon ] ) for @xmath96 : @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "we therefore conclude that for a power - law density profile , equation  ( [ epsilon ] ) works well at predicting the slopes of the power spectrum and the three - point @xmath0 in the nonlinear regime .",
    "this remains true even when the clustering of the halo centers and the correlation signal from non - halo particles are taken into account .",
    "to gain a better understanding of the behavior of two- and three - point statistics in the deeply nonlinear regime , we have investigated in this",
    "_ letter _ how the shapes of dark matter halos affect the power spectrum @xmath99 and the three - point amplitude @xmath0 at high @xmath9 . for halos with power - law density profiles , figures  2 and 3 demonstrate that the simple model of equation  ( [ epsilon ] ) works very well at predicting the slopes of @xmath99 and @xmath0 at high @xmath9 .",
    "the figures also show that the converse is not true : the slope of @xmath99 or @xmath0 _ alone _ does not determine a unique halo shape .",
    "for example , figure  2 shows that @xmath99 at high @xmath9 in the @xmath2 scale free model is only slightly changed when simulation halos are replaced with @xmath93 power - law halos",
    ". it would therefore be difficult to distinguish these two profiles using the power spectrum alone .",
    "the three - point @xmath0 , however , is drastically different for the two profiles .",
    "this indicates that although the nonlinear @xmath99 and @xmath0 are both closely related to the shapes of halos , they probe different regions and properties of the halos .",
    "a plausible explanation for this difference is that the two - point function reflects the mean density at a given distance from a particle , whereas the three - point function reflects the dispersion in density at the given scale ( peebles  1980 ,   36 ) .",
    "realistic dark matter halos do not have pure power law profiles .",
    "high - resolution @xmath1-body simulations have shown that cold dark matter halos have a roughly ( jing & suto 2000 ) universal density profile with @xmath100 at the outer radii and @xmath101 ( navarro , frenk & white 1997 ; huss , jain , & steinmetz 1999 ) or @xmath102 ( moore et al . 1999 ) nearer the halo centers .",
    "a further complication is that these profiles have a mass - dependent `` concentration parameter '' : less massive halos are more centrally concentrated .",
    "it will be useful to develop a model more extensive than equation  ( [ epsilon ] ) to incorporate these factors .",
    "such a model should help to shed light on why @xmath65 at high @xmath9 in our figures is approximately a power law , even though the halo profile in the simulations is not a pure power law .",
    "given that the shape of @xmath0 is highly sensitive to halo profiles , the model can also be used to tackle the question : what criteria must the halos satisfy in order for hierarchical clustering to occur ?    in the best simulation of the @xmath2 scale - free model available to us ( with 16.7 million particles and a force resolution of @xmath53 ) , we find that the three - point amplitude @xmath0 is not a constant with wavenumber @xmath9 and that the self - similar scaling observed for the two - point function ( jain & bertshinger 1998 ) does not hold as rigorously for the three - point function ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "we have checked for possible numerical artifacts using smaller simulations with different phases ( see   2 ) , and the results are similar within the range of overlap but may still be a manifestation of the finite simulation volume , to which the @xmath2 spectrum is particularly susceptible .",
    "based on lower resolution simulations for scale - free initial conditions with spectral index @xmath103 , fry et al .",
    "( 1993 ) suggested @xmath104 as the asymptotic value in the nonlinear regime .",
    "scoccimarro & frieman ( 1999 ) in so - called hyperextended perturbation theory obtain @xmath105 .",
    "these two expressions would predict @xmath106 and 2.5 , respectively , for @xmath2 at high @xmath9 .",
    "figure  1 shows that @xmath0 reaches a similar value between 2.5 and 3 at @xmath107 , but it rises to 4 to 5 at @xmath108 . for cdm - type models , the effective index decreases with @xmath9 , so the two expressions above would give @xmath0 rising with @xmath9 , but in neither case is the prediction as strong as what we see .",
    "it is useful to compare our numerical results with theoretical expectations . from the assumptions of stable clustering and self - similarity",
    ", it is well known that for the two - point function , @xmath109 at high @xmath9 for an initial @xmath110 ( davis & peebles 1977 ) .",
    "the nonlinear @xmath70 in figure  1 and earlier work of efstathiou et al .",
    "( 1988 ) , peacock & dodds ( 1996 ) , jain ( 1997 ) , ma ( 1998 ) , and jain & bertschinger ( 1998 ) all support this behavior . for the three - point function , these same conditions would result in constant @xmath0 , i.e. , hierarchical clustering .",
    "the fact that high - resolution simulation results do not support this implies that one of these assumptions  stability or self - similarity  must be violated , or still better future simulations are needed .",
    "we are grateful to john peacock for enlightening discussions and edmund bertschinger for providing the @xmath2 scale - free simulation .",
