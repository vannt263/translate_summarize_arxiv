    "the extragalactic @xmath0-ray background ( hereafter egb ) represents a fascinating challenge since its first detection by _",

    "@xcite , blazars are the most common objects in the extragalactic @xmath0-ray sky",
    ". blazars , radio loud agns with the jet pointing towards the earth , are classified as flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) and bl - lacs .",
    "after three years of observations , -lat detected approximately 1000 blazars with about the same number of fsrqs and bl - lacs @xcite .",
    "it results to be natural computing their contribution to the egb ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the main ingredients in the egb calculation are the @xmath0-ray luminosity function ( lf ) of blazars and their spectral energy distribution ( sed ) . in our model adopt a lf of fri and frii radio galaxies @xcite and the blazar seds using the the so - called _ blazar sequence _ @xcite .",
    "we compute the blazar contribution to the -lat egb fitting the differential -lat logn - logs , having as a sole fitting parameter the fraction of radio galaxies beamed towards the earth , hence appearing as blazars .",
    "beacause the blazar component alone is not able to fully account for the egb at low energies ( @xmath210 gev ) , we consider the @xmath0-ray emission of star - forming galaxies .",
    "this allows us to fully explain the egb but the last point at approximately 80 gev where the ebl absorption strongly dominates .",
    "notice that here we refer to egb as the sum of the resolved source component and the unresolved and/or truly diffuse emission .",
    "the blazar contribution ( in photons s@xmath4 @xmath5 sr@xmath4 mev@xmath4 ) to the egb at the observed energy @xmath6 is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the @xmath0-ray lf and @xmath9 is @xmath10 ( in erg / s ) at 100 mev , @xmath11 is the unabsorbed photon flux per unit energy @xmath12 measured on earth of a blazar with luminosity @xmath9 at redshift @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the optical depth for @xmath15 absorption .",
    "we adopt the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) model by @xcite . in the above equation @xmath16",
    "is the comoving cosmological volume .",
    "we set @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the number of sources @xmath19 per steradian with photon flux greater than @xmath20 is @xmath21 the @xmath0-ray lf of blazars is presently uncertain ( see e.g. @xcite ) , so that one has to rely on the lfs computed in other bands , e.g. , x - rays @xcite , or radio @xcite .",
    "we adopt here the radio lf at 151 mhz of fri and frii @xcite , assumed to be the parent populations of blazars : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is @xmath10 at 151 mhz , and the constant @xmath24 is the fraction of blazars over all radio galaxies . in order to convert radio into @xmath0-ray luminosity , we rely on the blazar spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , a relation between the radio and/or bolometric luminosity and the energy of the two peaks exists ( the so - called _ blazar sequence _",
    ", see also @xcite ) .",
    "we use the seds computed by @xcite .",
    "we use the model discussed in the previous section to compute the total contribution of blazars ( fsrqs and bl - lacs ) to the _",
    "fermi_-lat egb . to this end",
    "we fit blazar logn - logs distribution by letting @xmath25 to vary .",
    "we find @xmath26 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : conteggi ] , once fitted the total differential logn - logs , our model predict the correct number of bl - lacs and fsrqs without any change in the radio lf .",
    "this fact support the correctness of the initial hypothesis of radio galaxies as parental population of blazars .",
    "the number ratio of blazars to radio galaxies @xmath24 can be thought as a measure of the beaming factor of the relativistic jet , which in turn is related to the bulk lorentz factor @xmath27 . from @xmath28",
    "we derive @xmath29",
    ". + fig .",
    "[ fig : paola ] shows the corrisponding contribution of fsrqs and bl - lac to the total -lat egb .",
    "the background intensity is found to be @xmath30 and @xmath31 for fsrqs and bl - lacs respectively .",
    "the total egb intensity is therefore @xmath32 , corrisponding to @xmath33 of the one measured by -lat .",
    "+ from the slope of the fsrq and bl - lac component in fig .",
    "[ fig : paola ] we can see that the main photon index of fsrqs and bl - lacs resulting from our model are in agreement with the 2lac @xcite . + we note that blazars fall short to explain the measured egb at e@xmath210 gev and at e@xmath350 gev . at low energies , the discrepancy can be fully accounted by star - forming galaxies modeled following the recipes by@xcite , so that only the last point of the -lat egb measurement is not reproduced by our model .",
    "we have computed the overall contribution of blazars to the -lat egb .",
    "* we use the radio lf @xcite . fitting the differential logn - logs",
    "we obtain just the overall normalization @xmath25 , without any change on the bright and faint end of lf .",
    "+ in previous works @xcite@xcite it is assumed a lf in x band with three free parameters : the total normalization , the amount of bolometric radiation emitted in x - ray and the faint end of the x - ray lf .",
    "differently in @xcite the radio lf computed by ( @xcite ) is used , changing the faint end to obtain the contribution of fsrqs .",
    "* the second main point of our model is represented by the blazar sed .",
    "we assume that the spectra of blazar is fully taken into account by the _",
    "blazar sequence _ @xcite . on the contrary in @xcite",
    "it is assumed the blazar spectra as a simple and broken power law , respectively . in these works",
    "they assume a spectral index distribution peaked on the mean spectral index resulting from observations .",
    "the underlying assumption is that the unresolved blazar component has the same index distribution of the resolved component .",
    "using the blazar sequence such assumption is not necessary because the blazar seds are fully determined .",
    "the best fit value of the relative number of blazars with respect to radio galaxies can be translated into a bulk lorentz factor of the relativistic jet @xmath29 , larger than the average value @xmath34 estimated in @xcite .",
    "the two values could be reconciled if blazars commonly show secular @xmath0-ray large variability which modulates the 1-year average flux , as recently proposed in @xcite .",
    "+ to be consistent with the -lat points at lower energy , we add the star - forming component to our blazar model .",
    "fitting the -lat ebg with this two component model ( fig .",
    "[ fig : totale ] ) , we constrains the so - called  star formation efficiency of molecular hydrogen \" @xmath35yr@xmath4 , which we found well within existing , much looser observational constraints @xcite .",
    "+ the point at 80 gev remains unaccounted by our models calling for an additional ( local or low - z ) component . an intriguing possibility is represented by annihilation of a dark matter particle .",
    "we found , as an example , that a particle of mass @xmath36 tev and cross section @xmath37 @xmath38 s@xmath4 can easly accomodate the last data point ."
