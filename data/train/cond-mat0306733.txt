    "entanglement  @xcite denotes the nonlocal correlations that exist , even in the absence of direct interaction , between two ( spatially separated ) parts of a given quantum system . since the early days of quantum mechanics , understanding",
    "the phenomenon of entanglement has been central to the understanding of the foundations of quantum theory . besides its fundamental importance",
    ", a great deal of interest has been brought forth by its role in quantum information  @xcite .",
    "entanglement is believed to be the main ingredient of computational speed - up in quantum information protocols .",
    "most of the work on entanglement has been performed in optical systems with photons  @xcite , cavity qed systems  @xcite and ion traps  @xcite .",
    "only recently attention has been devoted to the manipulation of entangled states in a solid state environment .",
    "this interest , originally motivated by the idea to realize a solid state quantum computer  @xcite , has been rapidly growing and by now several works discuss how to generate , manipulate and detect entangled states in solid state systems .",
    "it is probably worth to emphasize already at this point that , differently from the situation encountered in quantum optics , in solid state system entanglement is rather common .",
    "what is not trivial is its control and detection ( especially if the interaction between the different subsystems forming the entangled state is switched off ) .    despite the large body of knowledge developed in the study of optical systems ,",
    "new strategies have to be designed to reveal the signatures of non - local correlations in the case of electronic states . for mesoscopic conductors ,",
    "the prototype scheme was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this work",
    "it has been shown that the presence of spatially separated pairs of entangled electrons , created by some _ entangler _ , can be revealed by using a beam splitter and by measuring the correlations of the current fluctuations in the leads .",
    "provided that the electrons injected are in an entangled state bunching and anti - bunching behavior for the cross - correlations of current fluctuations are found depending on whether the state is a spin singlet or a spin triplet .",
    "not only the noise , but the full counting statistics is sensitive to the presence of entanglement in the incoming beam  @xcite .",
    "the distribution of transmitted electrons is binomial and symmetric with respect to the average number of transmitted charges .",
    "moreover , this is important for the problem studied in the present work , the joint probability for counting electrons at different leads unambiguously characterizes the state of the incident electrons if one uses spin - sensitive electron counters . in this case",
    "the joint probability can not be expressed as a product of single - terminal probabilities .",
    "given the general setup to detect entanglement an important issue is to understand how to generate it .",
    "this has been discussed in several papers .",
    "most of the existing proposals are based on the generation of bell states by means of electron - electron interaction .",
    "this can be achieved through superconducting correlations  @xcite in hybrid normal - superconducting  @xcite and superconductor - carbon nanotubes systems  @xcite , quantum dots in the coulomb blockade regime  @xcite or kondo - like impurities  @xcite .",
    "then , by using energy or spin filters , the two electrons forming the bell state are separated .",
    "the entanglement can be created in the spin or in the orbital @xcite degrees of freedom . very recently , as it is also discussed in section  [ ns ] , it was shown that in a mesoscopic multi - terminal conductor entanglement can be produced also in absence of electron interaction  @xcite .",
    "besides electrons , it is possible to produce entangled states with cooper pairs in superconducting nanocircuits  @xcite or by coupling a mesoscopic josephson junctions with superconducting resonators  @xcite .",
    "since bell s work  @xcite , it is known that a classical theory formulated in terms of a hidden variables satisfying reasonable condition of locality , yields predictions which are different from those of quantum mechanics .",
    "these predictions were casted into the form of inequalities which any realistic local theory must obey .",
    "bell inequalities have been formulated for mesoscopic multi - terminal conductors in refs .",
    "@xcite in terms of electrical noise correlations at different terminals  @xcite .",
    "a test of quantum mechanics through bell inequalities in mesoscopic physics is very challenging and most probably it would be rather difficult , if not impossible , to get around all possible loopholes .",
    "although solid state systems are not the natural arena where to test the foundations of quantum mechanics , it is nevertheless very interesting to have access , manipulate and quantify these non - local correlations .    in this work",
    "we derive a bell inequality for the full electron counting statistics and discuss its properties .",
    "the formulation we follow is based on what is known as the clauser - horne ( ch ) inequality  @xcite .",
    "we shall show that the joint probabilities for a given number of electrons to pass through a mesoscopic conductor ( in a given time ) should satisfy , for a classical local theory , an inequality .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we motivate our approach to the problem , derive the ch inequality and express the joint probabilities needed in the ch inequality in terms of the scattering properties of the mesoscopic conductor .",
    "section [ results ] is devoted to the discussion of the results .",
    "we first consider the idealized situation where an incoming flux of fully entangled electrons is injected into the mesoscopic region .",
    "then we move on to analyze actual setups .",
    "interacting electrons are not necessary to have an entangled state , we show that a three terminal normal device is enough to lead to violation of the ch inequality . for completeness we also consider the case where entanglement is produced by andreev reflection . in the last section we present the conclusions and a brief summary of this work .",
    "electron full counting statistics ( fcs ) refers to the probability that a given number of electrons has traversed , in a time @xmath5 , a mesoscopic conductor . in the long time",
    "limit the first and the second moment of the probability distribution are related to the average current and noise , respectively .",
    "the reason for which we resort to fcs for analyzing electronic entanglement in a solid state environment resides in the fact that electrons in a conductor are not necessarily sufficiently separated from one another for coincidence counting to make sense , like in optical systems .",
    "furthermore , the measurement of single coincidence events in electronic solid state systems does not seem realizable at present .",
    "zero - frequency noise accounts for long time correlations and we do not expect it to be in general sensitive to coincidence measurements ( see however the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite for the limit of small transmission rates ) . from these premises",
    "we suggest that fcs is a natural candidate to formulate a bell - type inequality for electrons in mesoscopic conductors . in the case where only two entangled electrons are injected ,",
    "we find a situation similar to that with photons .",
    "more generally we discuss the case where a large number of electrons have been injected .    in its original version  @xcite , the bell inequality was derived for dicotomic variables .",
    "here we consider the more general formulation due to clauser and horne @xcite .",
    "we consider the idealized setup , illustrated in fig.[ent ] , which consists of the following parts . on the left we place an entangler that produces @xmath4 electrons in a spin entangled state ( in section [ results ] two different situations for the implementation of the entangler",
    "are discussed ) .",
    "two conductors , characterized by some scattering matrix , connect the terminals 3 and 4 of the entangler with the exit leads 1 and 2 so to carry the two particles belonging to each pair into two different spatially separated reservoirs . the electron counting is performed in leads 1 and 2 for electrons with spin aligned along the local spin - quantization axis at angles @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "detection is realized by means of spin - selective counters , _",
    "i.e. _ by counting electrons with the projection of the spin along a given local quantization - axis . in analogy with the optical case",
    "we say that the analyzer is not present when the electron counting is spin - insensitive ( electrons are counted irrespective of their spin direction ) .",
    "in section [ derivation ] we present the derivation of the ch inequality for the fcs and in section [ scatt ] we resume , for completeness , the relation between fcs and the scattering matrix @xmath8 .      the basic object for the formulation of the ch inequality is the joint probability @xmath9 for transferring a number of @xmath10 and @xmath11 electronic charges into leads @xmath12 and @xmath13 over an observation time @xmath5 . we follow closely the derivation given in ref .",
    "our starting point is the following algebraic inequality @xmath14 which holds for any variable @xmath15 .",
    "let us now introduce explicitly a set of hidden variables @xmath16 which take values in a space @xmath17 .",
    "we assume that the incoming entangled electron states are described by @xmath16 in all the details necessary to determine the probability distributions @xmath18 for transferring a number of @xmath19 electronic charges into lead @xmath20 . by imposing",
    "that the hidden variable theory is local , it follows that the joint probability can be expressed in the following form : @xmath21 where @xmath22 defines a probability measure on the space @xmath17 .",
    "the physical meaning of eq.([jpd1 ] ) is straightforward : it states that the probability distribution on lead @xmath23 does not depend on the probability distribution on the lead @xmath24 .",
    "we now introduce @xmath25 as the joint probability for transferring @xmath10 and @xmath11 electronic charges when both analyzers are present , while @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the corresponding joint probabilities when one of the two analyzers is removed .",
    "if the condition @xmath28 ( known as _ no - enhancement assumption _ ) is verified , it is possible to identify the variables appearing in eq.([clauser ] ) as follows : @xmath29 @xmath30 being the single terminal probability distribution in the presence of a analyzer .",
    "eq.([clauser ] ) can then be rewritten in terms of probabilities by multiplying each side of the equation by @xmath31 and integrating over the space @xmath17 .",
    "finally the following inequality is obtained @xmath32 eq.([chin ] ) is the ch inequality for the full counting statistics , ) is said to be weak in the sense that it holds only when the no - enhancement assumption , eq.([noen ] ) , is satisfied .",
    "] holding for all values of @xmath10 and @xmath11 which satisfy the no - enhancement assumption .",
    "we stress that the no - enhancement assumption , upon which eq.([chin ] ) is based , it is not satisfied in general like its optical version .",
    "the quantities that we have to compare are probability distributions , so that eq.([noen ] ) must be checked over the whole range of @xmath33 . for a fixed time @xmath5 and a given mesoscopic system ,",
    "hence for a given scattering matrix and incident particle state , the no - enhancement assumption is valid only in some range of values of @xmath33 .",
    "in particular , different sets of system parameters correspond to different such ranges .",
    "the quantity @xmath34 in eq.([chin ] ) depends on @xmath10 and @xmath11 so that the possible violation , or the extent of it , also depends on @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "given a certain average number @xmath35 of entangled pairs that have being injected in the time @xmath5 , one can look for the maximum violation as a function of the transmitted charges @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the joint probabilities appearing in eq.([chin ] ) can be determined once the scattering matrix @xmath8 of the mesoscopic conductor is known .",
    "the fcs in electronic systems was first introduced by levitov _",

    "these operators are linked by the equation @xmath54 and obey anti - commutation relations @xmath55 in the case of two and three dimensional leads one can separate longitudinal and transverse particle motion . since the transverse motion is quantized , the wave function relative to the plane perpendicular to the direction of transport is characterized by a set of quantum numbers which identifies the channels of the lead .",
    "such channels are referred to as open when the corresponding longitudinal wave vectors are real , since they correspond to propagating modes .",
