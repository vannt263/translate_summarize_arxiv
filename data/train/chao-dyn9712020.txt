    "molecular approach to macroscopic behavior of gases by means of the kinetic theory or nonequilibrium statistical mechanics has provided firmer basis for variety of fields of phenomenologies .",
    "most important contributions among them include ;    * derivation of the navier - stokes equation from boltzmann s equation @xcite @xcite , * proof that the classical ` equilibrium ' thermodynamics remains exact to the first order in translational noneqilibrium , namely that it has the same region of validity as the navier- stokes equation , not the inviscid euler equation @xcite , and * arrhenius rate law derived from the boltzmann equation for simple classical molecules executing reactive collisions , where the activation energy is expressed by parameters of particle mechanics , namely , reduced mass and the threshold potential for inelastic collisions @xcite .",
    "hence , those widely used tools of phenomenologies are warranted on ` first principles ' .    if the flow is turbulent , however , it is not obvious that those equations remain valid for instantaneous flow quantities that are both stochastic and fractal @xcite .",
    "in fact , as the matter of definition , the boltzmann function is the _",
    "mean _ number density in the six - dimensional phase(@xmath0-)space , so is subject to statistical averaging .",
    "therefore , the fluid velocity defined through a moment integral of the boltzmann function may not resolve small eddies or fractal behavior .",
    "therefore , if the ` first - principle ' ground of the navier - stokes equation to be used for the direct numerical simulation ( dns ) is asked , we have to address to _ unaveraged _ boltzmann function and to its governing equation that is free from statistical concept .",
    "needs for the approach along this line reflect the observation that if we leave the binary ( long range)correlation in the boltzmann equation , the chapman - enskog procedure applid to this equation leads not to the ` raw ' navier - stokes equation , but to reynolds averaged one @xcite .",
    "such a function known as the microscopic density is advocated by klimontovich in connection with plasma kinetic theory @xcite .",
    "it represents exact number density in the @xmath0- space , a deterministic function by nature .",
    "the equation governing the microscopic density for a neutral ideal gas is derived in @xcite .",
    "it is formulated as an equation of continuity in the @xmath0- space , happens to be identical in form with boltzmann s equation with different implications . in what follows this equation",
    "will be called master boltzmann equation ( mbe ) . molecular background for the fluid equations to be used for",
    "dns should be a fluid version of the mbe .",
    "the objective of this paper is to show how these fluid equations are derived on first principles of molecular dynamics for monatomic inert molecules , then how the situation differs crucially for reactive molecules .",
    "let the microscopic density be defined by the following expression after klimontovich @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a point in the @xmath0- space , namely , a 6 dimensional space consisting of the physical- plus molecular - velocity spaces , @xmath3 is locus of the @xmath4-th molecule in this space , @xmath5 denotes the 6-d delta function and the summation spans over total number of molecules n under consideration .",
    "if @xmath3 is given as the solution of hamiltonian mechanics of n - body system , formula ( 1 ) provides the most accurate expression for the instantaneous number density in the @xmath0- space .    according to this ` klimontovich formalism ' number density in the physical space",
    "is given by @xmath6 in the same way fluid velocity ( , t ) is defined by @xmath7 these expressions are to be compared with those of the boltzmann formalism of the classical kinetic theory of gases ; @xmath8 @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the boltzmann function defined by @xmath11 in this equation overbar ( @xmath12 ) denotes the standard ` average ' , namely ensumble average over repeated experiments , or equivalently , an average of hotwire output over a time long enough to smooth out fractals , yet short enough to resolve macroscopic unsteadiness such as periodic shedding of krmn vortices .",
    "we note that there are three different levels of description of the fluid velocity : obviously expression ( [ eq3 ] ) is the most exact one thinkable if @xmath13 $ ] are solved from hamiltonian mechanics of the n - particle system .",
    "therefore it is a deterministic quantity even if the flow is turbulent .",
    "this quantity , however , does not correspond to the fluid velocity as observed by macroscopic measurements such as hotwire anemometry . such velocity is represented by the one in which the microscopic density @xmath14 is replaced with its spacial average @xmath15 where the integration is taken over a small , yet macroscopic volume @xmath16 such that @xmath17 this is where stochastic facet of turbulence makes its appearance , therefore turbulent fluid velocity defined in terms of @xmath18 shows both stochastic and fractal behavior .",
    "the third level of description of fluid velocity is expression([eq5 ] ) that is defined by the boltzmann function , where the average is taken over a long time or a large number of repeated experiments so that both stochastic and fractal features are averaged out .",
    "the third level is what is called reynolds - average formalism or the boltzmann formalism , and will not be discussed here .",
    "it is shown that equation for @xmath14 of the first level of description has been derived as the equation of continuity in the @xmath0-space . for the usual monatomic gases it is given in the form of boltzmann s equation without invoking any statistical concept @xcite @xmath19= 0\\ ] ] with @xmath20 denoting the classical boltzmann collision integral defined by @xmath21 \\equiv \\int[\\underline{f}(z^{\\prime})\\underline{f}(\\widehat{z}^{\\prime})- \\underline{f}(z)\\underline{f}(\\widehat{z})]_{{\\mbox{\\boldmath{$x$}}}=\\widehat{{\\mbox{\\boldmath{$x$ } } } } } d \\widehat{{\\mbox{\\boldmath{$x$ } } } } d \\widehat{{\\mbox{\\boldmath{$v$}}}}\\ ] ] where the prime @xmath22 denotes a phase - space point of a particle that is supposed to reach the unprimed point after collision , and integration @xmath23 spans over the physical space of particle @xmath24 supposed to collide within unit of time .",
    "the master - boltzmann equation(mbe ) , namely , eq , ( [ eq9 ] ) for the microscopic density , serves the most precise description of collective behavior of the ensemble of the @xmath25-particle system .",
    "it can describe thermal agitations that are not tangible to macroscopic sensors .",
    "see ref.@xcite for derivation of the landau - lifshitz stress / heat flux density fluctuation formulae with even finer temporal resolvability than the original derivation @xcite .    it should be stressed that mbe holds for @xmath14 , not for @xmath18 unless @xmath26 a condition that lacks immediate justification is met .",
    "here we address to equations governing instantaneous fluid quantities by taking fluid moments of the mbe .",
    "a parallelism to the classical procedure by chapman - enskog or grad @xcite prevails also here except that the microscopic density replaces the boltzmann function , namely that exact delta function representation replaces hermite polynomial expansion around the maxwellian distribution .",
    "general expression for the moment equations of the mbe ( [ eq9 ] ) takes the usual form as follows , @xmath27 \\underline{f}\\ : \\underline{\\widehat{f } } d \\widehat{{\\mbox{\\boldmath{$x$ } } } } d { \\mbox{\\boldmath{$v$ } } } d \\widehat{{\\mbox{\\boldmath{$v$ } } } } \\\\ & [ [ m]]\\equiv m^{\\prime}+ \\widehat{m^{\\prime}}-m- \\widehat{m } \\end{array}\\right\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 stands for one of the following 13 moment functions ; @xmath29 with @xmath30 for the first three @xmath28 s that are summational invariants , @xmath31 is shown to vanish , and three conservation equations , same in form with the classical theory , result ; @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34+\\frac{\\partial } { \\partial x_{r}}[\\underline{\\rho}\\underline{u}_{r}(\\underline{h}+\\frac{\\underline{u}^{2}_{k}}{2})+\\underline{q}_{r}+\\underline{u}_{k}\\underline{p}_{kr}]=0\\ ] ] fluid quantities to appear in these equations differ from those of chapman - enskog theory in that there are no statistical concepts intervening .",
