    "inflation ( for a review see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) is by now considered to be an integral part of standard cosmology thanks to a plethora of precise observations on the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) and the large - scale structure in the universe .",
    "therefore , it is very important to construct realistic inflationary models based on particle theory and consistent with all the available cosmological and phenomenological requirements .",
    "undoubtedly , hybrid inflation @xcite is one of the most promising inflationary scenarios .",
    "it is @xcite naturally realized in the context of supersymmetric ( susy ) grand unified theory ( gut ) models based on gauge groups with rank greater than or equal to five .    in standard susy hybrid inflation , however , the gut gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken only at the end of inflation and , thus , if magnetic monopoles are predicted by this symmetry breaking , they are copiously produced @xcite , leading to a cosmological catastrophe .",
    "this disaster is avoided in the smooth @xcite or shifted @xcite variants of susy hybrid inflation , where the gut gauge symmetry is broken already during inflation .",
    "these variants were based on non - renormalizable superpotential terms .",
    "it was , though , subsequently shown that a new smooth @xcite and a new shifted @xcite hybrid inflation scenario can be constructed with only renormalizable superpotential terms within an extended pati - salam ( ps ) susy gut model , which was initially introduced @xcite for solving a very different problem . namely , the simplest susy ps model predicts ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) exact yukawa unification @xcite and , if it is supplemented with universal boundary conditions , yields unacceptable @xmath2-quark mass values .",
    "this problem is solved in the extended model , where yukawa unification is naturally and moderately violated .",
    "after the first accurate measurement @xcite of the scalar spectral index @xmath3 , however , it has been realized that there is a tension between all these well - motivated and natural inflationary scenarios and the measured value of this index .",
    "indeed , within the standard power - law cosmological model with cold dark matter and a cosmological constant , the data imply that @xmath3 is clearly lower than unity  for the latest results on @xmath3 see ref .",
    "inflationary scenarios , on the other hand , such as the ones mentioned above , within supergravity ( sugra ) with minimal khler potential , yield @xcite @xmath3 s which are very close to unity or even exceed it .",
    "one idea @xcite for reducing the predicted spectral index is based on the observation that @xmath3 generally decreases with the number of e - foldings suffered by our present horizon scale during inflation .",
    "so , reducing this number of e - foldings , we can achieve values of @xmath3 compatible with the recent data without having to abandon the use of a minimal khler potential .",
    "the additional number of e - foldings required for solving the horizon and flatness problems of standard hot big bang cosmology can be provided by a subsequent second stage of inflation .",
    "it is interesting to note that the extended susy ps model of ref .",
    "@xcite , which can lead to new smooth @xcite or new shifted @xcite hybrid inflation , can also provide us with a double inflation scenario called standard - smooth hybrid inflation @xcite which solves the above mentioned spectral index problem along the lines just discussed .",
    "the cosmological scales exit the horizon during the main stage of inflation , which is of the standard hybrid type and occurs as the system slowly rolls down a trivial classically flat direction on which the ps gauge group is unbroken .",
    "this direction is subsequently destabilized giving its place to a classically non - flat valley of minima along which new smooth hybrid inflation takes place with the ps gut gauge group being broken .",
    "consequently , magnetic monopoles are produced only at the end of the first stage of inflation , but they are adequately diluted by the second stage , which also provides the extra e - foldings needed for solving the puzzles of hot big bang cosmology .",
    "after the recent results of bicep2 @xcite on the b - mode in the polarization of the cmbr at degree angular scales , it seems possible that the inflationary scenarios will have to face a new challenge .",
    "namely , they should be able to accommodate appreciable values of the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath4 , since a b - mode of primordial origin could be due to the production of gravitational waves during inflation .",
    "we should , however , consider this possibility with reservation since some serious criticism @xcite to the original bicep2 analysis has already appeared claiming that the foreground from galactic polarized - dust emission has been underestimated . on the other hand ,",
    "after the recently released planck hfi 353 ghz dust polarization data @xcite , the first attempts to make a joint analysis of the planck and bicep2 data have been presented @xcite .",
    "they showed that , although @xmath4 is smaller than initially claimed , significant values of @xmath4  of order 0.01  can not be excluded .",
    "the most recent joint analysis @xcite yields an upper limit on @xmath4 of about 0.12 at @xmath5 confidence level .",
    "unfortunately , all the above mentioned variants of susy hybrid inflation predict negligible values of @xmath4 .",
    "so , it is certainly worth investigating whether realistic susy hybrid inflation models accommodating appreciable values of @xmath4 can be constructed .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , a double inflation scenario has been proposed which is compatible with the bicep2 data @xcite .",
    "the first stage of inflation is of the susy hybrid type , while the second stage is left unspecified , which makes the scenario incomplete .",
    "the inflationary potential is supplemented with a mass - squared term for the inflaton attributed to sugra corrections and with a logarithmic term representing very strong radiative corrections due to the susy breaking during inflation .",
    "it is the competition between these two contributions which allows appreciable values of @xmath4 while @xmath3 remains acceptable .",
    "the assumption , however , that an inflaton mass - squared term is the only relevant sugra correction during inflation in a scenario with planck - scale inflaton field values seems totally unjustified .",
    "in addition , this paper follows the usual practice of only taking into account the radiative corrections in the derivatives of the inflationary potential when calculating the slow - roll parameters and neglecting them when calculating the potential itself . in the case of extremely strong radiative corrections , however , this may lead to erroneous results .",
    "also , ref .",
    "@xcite attempts to accommodate the bicep2 results in a double hybrid inflation model where the inflaton potential changes dynamically with the evolution of the inflaton fields .",
    "the particular implementation of this interesting idea , though , appears to have some problems of naturalness in the design of the superpotential .",
    "in addition , the treatment of sugra seems to be incomplete . finally , ref .",
    "@xcite shows that , in susy hybrid inflation models , it is possible to obtain values of @xmath4 close to @xmath6 by employing an expansion of a non - minimal khler potential with appropriate coefficients .",
    "the validity of this approach may , however , be questionable since the inflaton takes values close to the planck scale .    in this paper",
    ", we will show that a reduced version of the extended susy ps model of ref .",
    "@xcite can yield a two stage inflationary scenario which can predict values of @xmath4 up to about @xmath7 .",
    "larger values of the tensor - to - scalar ratio would lead to unacceptably large running of the scalar spectral index . in the range of the model parameters considered here ,",
    "the model in the global susy limit possesses practically two classically flat directions , namely the trivial and the semi - shifted @xcite one . after including sugra corrections , the trivial path , on which the full gut gauge group is unbroken ,",
    "is stabilized and a first stage of inflation can occur as the system slowly rolls down this path .",
    "all the cosmological scales exit the horizon during this stage and our present horizon undergoes a limited number of e - foldings",
    ". the obtained tensor - to - scalar ratio can be appreciable while the scalar spectral index assumes acceptable values thanks to the competing effect of the sufficiently mild sugra corrections resulting from the construction of ref .",
    "@xcite and the strong radiative corrections to the inflationary potential .",
    "subsequently , a second inflationary stage occurs along the semi - shifted path , where @xmath8 remains unbroken , and provides the additional number of e - foldings required for solving the standard problems of hot big bang cosmology .",
    "this is possible since , for our choice of parameters , the semi - shifted path is almost perpendicular to the trivial path and , thus , is not affected by the strong radiative corrections on the trivial path .",
    "it is also important that the sugra corrections on the semi - shifted path are kept sufficiently mild again by the mechanism of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we first present , in sec .",
    "[ sec : susy ] , the salient features of the model in global susy . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sugra ] , we then calculate the sugra and one - loop radiative corrections to the potential and discuss our double inflationary scenario . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] , we summarize our conclusions . throughout",
    ", we will use units where the reduced planck mass @xmath9 is equal to unity .",
    "we consider a reduced version of the extended susy ps model of ref .  @xcite .",
    "this version is based on the left - right symmetric gauge group @xmath10 , which is a subgroup of the ps group .",
    "the superfields of the model which are relevant for inflation are the following .",
    "a gauge singlet @xmath11 , a pair of superfields @xmath12 , @xmath13 belonging to the @xmath14 representation of @xmath15 , and a conjugate pair of higgs superfields @xmath16 and @xmath17 belonging to the @xmath18 and @xmath19 representations of @xmath15 , respectively . the field @xmath12 acquires a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) which breaks @xmath15 to @xmath20 with @xmath21 being the standard model ( sm ) gauge group , while the vevs of @xmath16 and @xmath17 cause the breaking of @xmath15 to @xmath21 .",

    "the superpotential terms relevant for inflation are [ eq : superpotential ] w = s(m^2-^2)-sh|h+ m| -|h|h , where @xmath24 , @xmath25 are superheavy masses and @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 are dimensionless coupling constants .",

    ", the new shifted flat direction practically coincides with the trivial one and , thus , plays no independent role in our scheme .",
    "in this section , we will show that , after including sugra corrections , the trivial path becomes stable for large absolute values of the real canonically normalized inflaton .",
    "thus , it can support a first stage of inflation during which the universe undergoes a number of e - foldings which , although limited , is adequately large for all the cosmological scales to exit the horizon .",
    "strong radiative corrections to the inflationary potential , which are controlled by the parameter @xmath26 , in conjunction with mild surga corrections then guarantee that an appreciable value of the tensor - to - scalar ratio can be achieved together with an acceptable value of the scalar spectral index .",
    "our scenario can predict values of the tensor - to - scalar ratio only up to about @xmath7 because larger values require unacceptably large running of the scalar spectral index .",
    "a subsequent second stage of inflation along the semi - shifted path can provide the additional number of e - foldings required for solving the horizon and flatness problems of the standard hot big bang cosmology .",
    "this is possible since , for the parameters chosen , this direction is almost orthogonal to the trivial path and , thus , it is not affected by the strong radiative corrections present during the first stage of inflation . in this connection",

    "consequently , this number is not too sensitive to the value of @xmath176 .    in order to support the statements made above concerning the numerical part of our work , we depict , in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the evolution of the fields @xmath79 and @xmath177 as functions of the number of e - foldings @xmath178 starting from the point where the pivot scale @xmath179 exits the horizon for a particular choice of initial conditions at this point .",
    "namely , we start with @xmath180 , @xmath181 , @xmath182 , @xmath183 , and @xmath184 corresponding to an almost d - flat direction .",
    "all the fields are given zero initial velocity except for @xmath79 the velocity of which is taken to be @xmath185 .",
    "this is , indeed , the actual value of the velocity of @xmath79 on the trivial path , which was determined numerically .",
    "we observe that @xmath79 assumes values above its critical value for about @xmath186 e - foldings . towards the end of the first inflationary stage , @xmath79 oscillates with appreciable amplitude around zero four times .",
    "we may consider that , during these oscillations , the first stage of inflation has not come to an end .",
    "when the amplitude of the oscillations falls below the critical value of @xmath79 , @xmath87 moves to its value on the semi - shifted path and @xmath177 starts performing slow oscillations with variable amplitudes typically of order @xmath24 .",
    "the size of @xmath177 remains small for about @xmath187 e - foldings before starting its growth and acquires its largest value @xmath188 at @xmath189 , when the second inflationary stage may be considered as having already started . for @xmath190 ,",
    "the evolution of @xmath177 follows eq .",
    "( [ ef ] ) closely .",
    "if we allow for a stronger running of the scalar spectral index , we may obtain larger values of @xmath4 .",
    "for example , taking @xmath191 , @xmath192 , and @xmath193 , we find @xmath194 , @xmath195 , @xmath196 , @xmath197 , @xmath198 , @xmath199 , and @xmath200 .",
    "in addition , we choose @xmath201 , @xmath131 , and @xmath132 . with these choices ,",
    "the pivot scale suffers about @xmath202 e - foldings during the first stage of inflation and , consequently , approximately another @xmath203 e - foldings must be provided by the second stage .",
    "this implies that @xmath204 lies in the range @xmath205 .",
    "we verified numerically that the fulfillment of this requirement is indeed feasible . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we depict the evolution of the fields @xmath79 and @xmath177 as functions of the number of e - foldings @xmath178 again starting from the point where the pivot scale @xmath179 exits the horizon for a particular choice of initial conditions at this point .    needless to say that , changing the values of the input parameters of the model , we can easily achieve successful solutions with smaller values of the tensor - to - scalar ratio and that there is no particular fine - tuning of the parameters required in our model .",
    "after the termination of the first stage of inflation , the system moves towards the semi - shifted path and the group @xmath41 breaks spontaneously to a @xmath22 subgroup by the nonzero value which the field @xmath12 develops .",
    "this leads to the formation of superheavy magnetic monopoles .",
    "we can obtain a rough order of magnitude estimate of the mean distance between the monopoles and the antimonopoles , which is though adequate for our purposes here .",
    "we assume that , at production , this distance is @xmath206 as determined by the relevant higgs boson mass with @xmath207 being a geometric factor . in the matter dominated period between the two inflationary stages ,",
    "this distance increases by a factor @xmath208 , where @xmath89 and @xmath135 are the classical potential energy densities on the trivial and the semi - shifted paths , respectively .",
    "the subsequent second inflationary stage stretches this distance by a factor @xmath209 , where @xmath210 is the number of e - foldings during this stage which is large but not huge  cf .",
    "@xcite . in the period of damped oscillations of the inflaton field",
    ", the monopole - antimonopole distance increases by another factor @xmath211 , where @xmath212 is the reheat temperature , which we take to be @xmath213 , and @xmath214 with @xmath215 being the effective number of massless degrees of freedom at cosmic temperature @xmath216 . in the radiation dominated period which follows reheating ,",
    "the monopole - antimonopole distance is multiplied by another factor @xmath217 , where @xmath134 is the cosmic time .",
    "so this distance , in the radiation dominated period , becomes ~()^ c(t_r ) ^-c(t)^p ( 2m)^-1e^n_2()^t_r t^. equating this distance with the post - inflationary particle horizon @xmath218 , we find the time @xmath219 ( in @xmath220 units ) at which the monopoles enter this horizon : t_h~ c(t_r)^-c(t_h)^e^2n_2 ( ) ^ , [ th ] where @xmath221 is the cosmic temperature at cosmic time @xmath219 .",
    "the formation of monopoles is not the whole story though since our scenario leads to the generation of cosmic strings too . indeed , after the end of the second inflationary stage , the system settles in one of the two distinct continua of susy vacua in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : vacua+ ] ) and ( [ eq : vacua- ] ) with @xmath222 in our case and a linear combination of the @xmath8 gauge symmetry and the unbroken @xmath22 subgroup of @xmath41 breaks spontaneously leading to the production of local cosmic strings . these strings ,",
    "if they survived after recombination , could have a small contribution to the cmbr power spectrum parametrized @xcite by the dimensionless string tension @xmath223 , where @xmath224 is newton s gravitational constant and @xmath225 is the string tension , i.e. the energy per unit length of the string . applying to our case the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , which considered local strings within the abelian higgs model in the bogomolnyi limit , we write , for the string tension , [ eq : stringtension ] _",
    "s=4||^2 , where @xmath226 is the vev of @xmath16 .",
    "although the strings in our model are more complicated than in the bogomolnyi limit of the abelian higgs model , we think that the above estimate for the string tension is good enough for our purposes here .    in our case , the strings decay well before recombination and , thus , do not affect the cmbr .",
    "the reason is that they are mostly open strings connecting monopoles to antimonopoles .",
    "this is easily understood if we realize that the breaking of @xmath227 to @xmath228 by @xmath226 and @xmath229 is similar to the breaking of the electroweak gauge group and , thus , can not lead to any topologically stable monopoles or strings  see ref .",
    "@xcite for a more detailed argument .",
    "it can only lead to the existence of topologically unstable dumbbell configurations @xcite consisting of an open string with a monopole and an antimonopole at its two ends .",
    "the strings , at any given time after their formation , can be thought of as random walks with a step of the order of the particle horizon @xcite  to describe the evolution of this string network , we will follow closely this reference .",
    "they typically connect monopoles to antimonopoles , but unstable closed strings of limited size may also exist . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , at all times before the entrance of the monopoles into the horizon , there is of the order of one string segment per horizon and , thus , the ratio of the energy density @xmath230 of the string network to the total energy density @xmath231 of the universe remains practically constant . at cosmic time @xmath219",

    "@xmath219 is then @xmath235 . after this time ,",
    "more and more string segments enter the horizon , but the length of each segment remains constant .",
    "consequently , the system of string segments behaves like pressureless matter and , thus , @xmath236 , which implies that the ` relative string energy density ' ~2g_s ( ) ^ [ strenergy ] ( @xmath237 is the photon energy density ) increases with time  remember that we are in the radiation dominated era of the universe and , thus , @xmath238 .",
    "the strings , finally , decay at cosmic time @xcite t_d~(g_s)^-12t_h , where @xmath239 , by emitting gravitational waves with energy density @xmath240 at production given by [ rhogwtd ] ~2 ( ) ^(g_s)^ as one can infer from eq .",
    "( [ strenergy ] ) .",
    "note that this formula also gives the maximal relative string energy density .    from eq .",
    "( [ th ] ) where we substitute the lowest value of the number of e - foldings @xmath210 and take @xmath241 , we find that , for the two numerical examples presented , @xmath242 and @xmath243 , respectively . in deriving these values , we take @xmath244 , which corresponds to the spectrum of the minimal susy sm , and @xmath245 and @xmath246 in our two numerical examples , respectively .",
    "the above values of @xmath247 are consistent with the effective number of massless degrees of freedom at the cosmic temperatures @xmath221 corresponding to the values of the cosmic time @xmath219 obtained .",
    "we see that the strings enter the horizon well before the time of big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "their decay time is @xmath248 and @xmath249 , in the two cases , as one can find from the corresponding dimensionless string tensions [ gmus ] g_s= 3.19 10 ^ -77.5710 ^ -7 .",
    "this means that the cosmic strings decay around the time of nucleosynthesis and , thus , well before recombination which takes place at a cosmic time @xmath250 . as a consequence",
    ", they do not affect the cmbr .",
    "their maximal relative energy density in the universe is @xmath251 and @xmath252 for our two numerical examples .",
    "so the cosmic strings remain always subdominant . in particular",
    ", they do not disturb nucleosynthesis at all .",
    "had the strings been around until the present time , an upper bound would have to be imposed on the dimensionless string tension in order to keep their contribution to the cmbr power spectrum at an acceptable level .",
    "for the abelian - higgs field theory model , this bound is found to be @xcite [ gmu ] g_s3.210 ^ -7 . in our first numerical example , the dimensionless string tension @xmath223 given in eq .",
    "( [ gmus ] ) almost saturates the upper bound in eq .",
    "( [ gmu ] ) , but violates the recent more stringent upper bound @xcite [ gmunano ] g_s3.310 ^ -8 from pulsar timing arrays , which also holds for strings surviving until the present time .",
    "our second numerical example violates both the bounds in eqs .",
    "( [ gmu ] ) and ( [ gmunano ] ) .",
    "thus , both our examples are only possible because the strings decay sufficiently early .",
    "the value of the ratio of the energy density of the gravitational waves produced by the strings to that of the photons at the present cosmic time @xmath253 is found from eq .",
    "( [ rhogwtd ] ) to be  cf . ref .",
    "@xcite  ~2 ( ) ^ ( g_s)^ ( ) ^. the present abundance of these gravitational waves is then given by _",
    "gw h^2 ( t_0)~()()h_0 ^ 2 , where @xmath254 is the present critical energy density of the universe and @xmath255 the present value of the hubble parameter in units of @xmath256 .",
    "we find that , for our two numerical examples , @xmath257 and @xmath258 , respectively .",
    "the frequency @xmath259 of these gravitational waves at production must be @xmath260 since the length of the decaying strings is @xmath261  see ref .",
    "the present value of this frequency is then f(t_0)~t_h^-1()^ ( ) ^ , where @xmath262 is the equidensity time at which matter starts dominating the universe .",
    "for the two numerical examples , this frequency turns out to be @xmath263 and @xmath264 , respectively .",
    "note that the estimate of the frequencies and abundances of the gravity waves presented here can not be made much more accurate , but it can certainly be considered good enough for our purposes .",
    "we see that the predicted frequencies of the gravitational waves are too high to yield any restrictions from cmbr considerations @xcite . they are also well above the range of frequencies probed by the pulsar timing array observations @xcite .",
    "so , the most recent stringent bound @xcite from these observations does not apply to our case .",
    "however , the frequency of the gravitational waves in our first numerical example lies marginally within the range to be probed by the future space - based laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatories such as the evolved laser interferometer space antenna / new gravitational - wave observatory ( elisa / ngo ) @xcite , which is expected to be able to detect values of @xmath265 as low as @xmath266 .",
    "our overall conclusion is that the monopole - string system disappears without causing any trouble , but the gravitational waves that it generates may be probed by future space - based laser interferometer observations .",
    "in view of the recent results @xcite indicating that appreciable values of the tensor - to - scalar ratio in the cmbr can not be excluded , we addressed the question whether such values can be obtained in susy hybrid inflation models resulting from particle physics . to this end , we have considered a reduced version of the extended susy ps model of ref .",
    "@xcite , which was initially constructed for solving the @xmath2-quark mass problem of the simplest susy ps model with universal boundary conditions .",
    "the reason for focusing on this model is that it is known to support successful versions of hybrid inflation like the standard - smooth one @xcite .",
    "this scenario is compatible with all the recent data even with a minimal khler potential , but predicts negligible values of the tensor - to - scalar ratio .    in the context of this particular particle physics model",
    ", we demonstrated that a two stage hybrid inflationary scenario which can predict values of the tensor - to - scalar ratio of the order of @xmath0 can be constructed .",
    "for the values of the parameters considered in this paper , the model in the global susy limit possesses practically two classically flat directions , the trivial and the semi - shifted @xcite one .",
    "the sugra corrections to the potential stabilize the trivial flat direction so that it becomes able to support a first stage of inflation .",
    "all the cosmological scales exit the horizon during this inflationary stage and our present horizon undergoes a limited number of e - foldings .",
    "the tensor - to - scalar ratio can acquire appreciable values as a result of sufficiently mild ( i.e. non - catastrophic ) , but still appreciable sugra corrections combined with strong radiative corrections to the inflationary potential , while the value of the scalar spectral index remains acceptable .",
    "we can obtain values of the tensor - to - scalar ratio up to about @xmath7 .",
    "larger values would require unacceptably large running of the scalar spectral index .",
    "the additional number of e - foldings required for solving the standard problems of hot big bang cosmology are generated by a second inflationary stage taking place along the semi - shifted path , where @xmath8 is unbroken .",
    "this is possible since the semi - shifted direction , being almost orthogonal to the trivial path , is not affected by the strong radiative corrections on the trivial path and also because the sugra corrections on the semi - shifted path remain mild .    at the end of the first inflationary stage ,",
    "the group @xmath41 breaks spontaneously to a @xmath22 subgroup and , thus , magnetic monopoles are formed .",
    "the subsequent spontaneous breaking of a linear combination of this @xmath22 and @xmath8 at the end of the second inflationary stage leads to the production of cosmic strings connecting these monopoles to antimonopoles . at later times",
    ", the monopoles enter the horizon and the string - monopole system decays into gravity waves well before recombination without leaving any trace in the cmbr .",
    "the resulting gravity waves , however , may be measurable in the future .",
