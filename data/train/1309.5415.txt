    "it is well known that the performance of most photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) is susceptible to even small local magnetic field such as that of the earth , which is typically in the range of 0.4 to 0.5 gauss @xcite .",
    "the impact of this kind of weak magnetic field can be reduced by shielding the pmt , especially the region near the photocathode , with high - permeability materials such as mu - metal .",
    "we describe here a new type of magnetic shield that has been developed at the lawrence berkeley national laboratory for use in the daya bay reactor neutrino oscillation experiment @xcite .",
    "it utilizes finemet , a novel thin flexible high - permeability material , to form a truncated cone around a large - aperture pmt behind the photocathode . in the following sections we describe the detailed characteristics of this shield , and present experimental results showing its impact on the performance of some selected pmts .",
    "in particular we will show that it reduces variations in the pmt response caused by changes in the relative orientation of the pmt and magnetic field , and that it significantly improves the electron collection efficiency of the pmt .",
    "these improvements have a direct impact on the physics objectives of an experiment in that they result in a greater uniformity of response of the detector , and thereby yield a more reliable measurement of the energy of an event .",
    "we have investigated the effect of the magnetic field on the gain and charge collection of some large - aperture pmts .",
    "these results are of particular relevance to experiments where the events of interest produce at most a few photoelectrons ( pes ) in a given pmt .",
    "the magnetic field also affects multi - photoelectron events , but in this case it is not possible to separate the effects caused by gain variation from those attributable to collection efficiency . in this study we used electron tubes 9354 kb @xcite , hamamatsu r5912 @xcite , and photonis xp1806 @xcite 20-cm pmts .",
    "we determined the effect of the local magnetic field on the response of a pmt by positioning the pmt with its polar axis perpendicular to the field , as shown in figure  [ fig : magneticsetup](a ) .",
    "the pmt was mounted on a holder that could be rotated about the polar axis from outside of the dark box containing the pmt .",
    "light from a pulsing blue led illuminated the entire photocathode , and its intensity could be controlled as needed in the study .",
    "the charge associated with the pmt signal was measured with an analog - to - digital converter ( adc ) as a function of the angle between the local magnetic field and a reference on the pmt , denoted by @xmath1 . in this study ,",
    "the polarized key on the socket of the pmt , shown in figure  [ fig : magneticsetup](b ) , was chosen as the reference direction . when this reference direction was parallel ( normal ) to the local field , @xmath1 was @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the @xmath1-dependence of the charge variation at some operating high voltages for the electron tubes 9354 kb , hamamatsu r5912 , and photonis xp1806 pmts is shown in figures  [ fig : et5428_magnetic ] , [ fig : hama4327_magnetic ] and [ fig : photonis1135_magnetic ] respectively .",
    "the charge variation , @xmath4 , is defined as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the amount of charge collected at angle @xmath1 , and @xmath7 is the average amount of collected charge given by @xmath8 with @xmath9 being the number of measurements done at various @xmath1 values .    for each type of pmt",
    "the result is quite insensitive to the applied voltage .",
    "the difference in the observed behaviour between the three pmt models is a consequence of the different designs of the dynode structure and focussing scheme .",
    "figure  [ fig : pmt_aperture ] shows the opening to the first dynode for these three kinds of pmts .",
    "electron tubes 9354 kb has the smallest opening ( most affected ) whereas photonis xp1806 has the largest opening ( least affected ) .                      a revealing way to study the influence of the magnetic field on the detected charge is to use single - photoelectron events . by making this measurement without a magnetic shield",
    "we can directly determine how the shield affects both the gain and the collection efficiency of the pmt .",
    "the spe spectrum can be obtained by reducing the light intensity on the photocathode until only about 10% of the triggers produce a signal . from poisson statistics about 95% of the observed pulses",
    "are produced by spes .",
    "the spectrum of the charge collected at the anode under this condition is shown in figure  [ fig : hama4338_000_spe ] . since the charge of a single electron",
    "is known _ a priori _ , the calibrated adc channel of the spe peak can be used to determine the absolute gain of the pmt .",
    "photoelectrons generated at the photocathode are directed to the first dynode by a set of focussing electrodes .",
    "the configuration of the focussing elements and the effective area of the first dynode determines the collection efficiency .",
    "the lorentz force , * v * @xmath10 * b * , on the photoelectrons in the rather long distance between the photocathode and the first dynode causes some of them to be swept away from the first dynode and thereby reduces the collection efficiency . the number of events in the spe distribution is proportional to the efficiency of collecting the produced spe by the first dynode of the pmt .    using a hamamatsu r5912 without a magnetic shield",
    "we have obtained spe spectra with the pmt reference direction parallel ( @xmath11 ) and perpendicular ( @xmath12 ) to the local magnetic field .",
    "the observed adc spectrum of each orientation , a convolution of the spe distribution and the pedestal , is shown in figure  [ fig : hama4338_000_spe ] . the observed spectrum",
    "was fitted to two gaussian functions , one for the pedestal and the other one for the spe distribution , and an exponential function for modeling the non - gaussian component of the pedestal .",
    "the gain , peak - to - valley ratio ( p / v ratio ) and charge resolution of the pmt were obtained from the best fits which are displayed in figure  [ fig : hama4338_000_spe ] .",
    "the results are tabulated in table  [ tab : hama4338_000_spe ] .",
    "it is interesting to note that the change in gain between the two orientations is small . from figure",
    "[ fig : hama4327_magnetic ] , we see a 15% difference in the charge variation between these two angular positions ; that is , the collection efficiency has changed by about 15% .",
    "this result suggests that the majority of the secondary electrons produced within the dynodes are not significantly affected by the magnetic field .",
    "however , the peak - to - valley ratio gets worse when the magnetic effect is more pronounced . a series of measurements was made to determine how the collection efficiency in the presence of a magnetic field depends on the potential difference between the photocathode and first dynode .",
    "the results showed almost no effect on the collection efficiency when the potential difference was within 250 v of its nominal value , typically several hundred volts , for a gain of @xmath13 .    ) ; figure on the right is determined with the magnetic field perpendicular to the pmt reference direction ( @xmath14 ) .",

    "we have observed that if it is not stored in a ventilated location progenies of radon can accumulate gradually on the surfaces of the laminated finemet foil .    besides radioactivity",
    ", we have also investigated the compatibility of finemet with mineral oil and 18-m@xmath21 ultra - pure water , which are commonly used in nuclear and particle - physics experiments . by submerging a piece of finemet sample with known dimensions in each liquid at elevated temperature for accelerated aging studies",

    "the absorbance of purified water at 70  @xmath22c for a finemet sample with a s / v of 0.32 @xmath23 is summarized in figure  [ fig : finemet - water ] . in the vicinity of 350 nm , the rate of change in absorbance levels off in about two weeks after a relatively fast degradation in the beginning .",

    "as illustrated in figure  [ fig : fan ] , a truncated conical magnetic shield for the hamamatsu r5912 pmts used in the daya bay experiment was realized by cutting a two - dimensional fan out of a piece of finemet foil with a water jet .",
    "the conically shaped shield was made by wrapping the fan around the pmt as shown in figure  [ fig : coneshield ] .",
    "it was firmly held in place between the equator of the glass bulb and the acrylic potting shell surrounding the base by tucking the tabs into the pre - cut slots .",
    "the shield is flexible , so any deformation of the cone can be taken out easily by simple manipulation of the surface .",
    "the weight of such a finemet shield for a typical 20-cm pmt is about 20 g.              the effectiveness of the truncated conical finemet shield depends on the slant height of the cone . for the hamamatsu r5912 assembly",
    "used in the daya bay experiment , the magnetic shield extends from the acrylic sealing shell to the equator of the bulb , where the photocathode ends .",
    "we have evaluated the performance of the finemet magnetic shields with slant heights of 15.4 cm , 16.7 cm , 18.1 cm , 19.2 cm , and 23.0 cm , where the 23 cm - long shield extends to the plane tangent to the apex of the pmt bulb .",
    "the nominal slant height of the shield used in daya bay is 15.4 cm , ending right at the contact point of the bulb near the equator .",
    "for the photonis xp1806 pmt assembly we used shields with slant heights of 14.3 cm and 23.6 cm which extended to the equator and the apex of the pmt bulb respectively .",
    "the corresponding slant heights are 14.5 cm and 22.5 cm for the electron tubes 5394 kb pmt .      with the polar axis of the pmt normal to the local magnetic field as shown in figure  [ fig : magneticsetup ] , the amount of collected charge relative to the one without shielding at @xmath24 ( relative collection efficiency ) for the hamamatsu r5912 pmt as a function of the slant height of the finemet shield for different @xmath1 angles is shown in figure  [ fig : hama4338_ceff ] .",
    "the magnetic shield clearly improves the collection of charge .",
    "relative to the case of without any shielding , a finemet shield with a slant height of 15.4 cm ( 23.0 cm ) improves the average collection efficiency by 8% ( 19% ) .",
    "furthermore , as shown in figure  [ fig : hama4338_variation_all ] , the charge variation as a function of the @xmath1 angle is reduced when the slant height increases .",
    "for example , without shielding , the peak - to - peak difference in the charge variation is about 23% .",
    "a finemet shield with a slant height of 23.0 cm shrinks this difference to approximately 5% . even a shield that covers only up to the equator ( 15.4 cm ) allows us to achieve almost the same performance .",
    "this implies that the shield provides a less non - uniform collection efficiency to this level over the entire photocathode .",
    "similarly , the results on collecting charge and minimizing the variation of the collection efficiency for the photonis xp1806 and electron tubes 9354 kb pmts with finemet shields are depicted in figures  [ fig : photonis1211_ceff ] , [ fig : photonis1211_variation_all ] , [ fig : et5428_ceff ] and [ fig : et5428_variation_all ] . for the photonis xp1806 pmt , on average ,",
    "the collection efficiency is increased by about 5% ( 14% ) for a shield with a slant height of 14.3 cm ( 23.6 cm ) , and the variation in the amount of charge collected is reduced from 10% to 1.3% which is close to our systematic limit .",
    "the most dramatic improvement is achieved with the electron tubes 9354 kb pmt . in this case",
    "the average collection efficiency is up by about 25% for a finemet shield extending to the equator and 40% for shields reaching to the apex of the pmt bulb .",
    "the variation in the collection efficiency is reduced from 46% with no shield to 21% ( 5% ) for a shield with a slant height of 14.5 cm ( 22.5 cm ) .",

    "one part of the led light was sent to a reference pmt to monitor the intensity of the led , and the other part to the photocathode of the hamamatsu pmt .",
    "a collimator was used to limit the spot size of the incident light at the photocathode to a circle with a radius of 2 mm .",
    "the led intensity was set to produce at least 20 photoelectrons per pulse on the photocathode .",
    "runs of ten seconds duration at a pulse rate of 100 hz were used to measure the response of the pmt for every point on the photocathode .",
    "an adc was gated by the pulse generator used to drive the led .",

    "the light source was moved under computer control to the next point on the grid until the whole surface of the photocathode was scanned .            in the absence of any magnetic field",
    "we expect rather uniform collection efficiency over the photocathode .",
    "however , the earth s magnetic field in the transverse direction creates a position - dependent response . in this case the field acting on a pmt with no shielding produces large non - uniformity as shown in figure  [ fig : uiuc1 ] .",
    "the lowest collection efficiency occurs in a region centered at x @xmath34 6 cm and y = 0 cm .",
    "in addition , the response of the pmt is almost symmetric about the x - axis .",
    "this result is a direct consequence of the fact that the internal structure of the pmt is symmetric about the x - axis , so that with the magnetic field in the negative y - direction the response of the pmt should be symmetric across the x - axis .",
    "this symmetry should not exist for the y - axis because the internal structure of the pmt is different across the y - axis , and also because a magnetic field in the negative y - direction will affect the motion of electrons in the x - direction .",

    "the results for the shields with slant height of 15.4 cm and 20.5 cm are presented in figure  [ fig : uiuc4 ] .",
    "the 20.5-cm shield has a more uniform response than the 15.4-cm shield , although even with this long shield there are still significant residual non - uniformities .",
    "however , both of these shields clearly produce a better performance for the pmt than that obtained with no shield .",
    "we have presented the performance of a truncated conical magnetic shield made of finemet . mechanically , it is thin , light , flexible , relative cheap , and easy to handle .",
    "in addition , the laminated finemet sheet is compatible with mineral oil and purified water . we have demonstrated that finemet is very effective in shielding large - aperture pmts against magnetic field . as a result ,",
