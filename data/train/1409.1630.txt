    "the question of the early evolution of low - mass galaxies has been a vexing one for galaxy formation theory in a wide range of hierarchical merger models for more than three decades ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . during this timespan",
    "a range of problems has been identified and addressed in successive generations of models ; these problems tend to relate to the efficiency with which gas is accreted , retained , cooled , and astrated in the lowest - mass dark matter halos .",
    "recurring issues surrounding the over- or under - production of stars in simulations include overcooling , reionization , the role of feedback , and the effects of tidal perturbations ; a recent , detailed discussion of these issues in the context of local group dwarf galaxies may be found in @xcite .",
    "a variety of recently proposed solutions invoke a range of external heating and internal feedback processes , many of which are strongly mass and/or environment dependent ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) ; the influence of numerical resolution on the simulations is also likely to play a role ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in addition to supernova feedback , reionization of the universe at redshifts @xmath56 has been considered as a source of heating that might inhibit star formation in the smallest galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in the simplest formulation , reionization may quench star formation in galaxies with total dark halo mass @xmath610@xmath7 m@xmath8 by warming gas to the point where it may be driven out of the shallow potential wells of these systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) ; a review of the observational evidence for and against such a scenario has been given by @xcite , who find that there is some evidence for negative feedback on star formation , but with large galaxy - to - galaxy variability and with some inconsistency between the quenching timescale and the epoch of reionization .",
    "while some process ( or set of processes ) clearly inhibits the formation of dwarf galaxies compared to their proliferation in cold dark matter - only simulations , the nature of these processes is still an open question",
    ". continued observational study of _ isolated _ dwarfs is necessary for at least two reasons ; one is to probe the ancient star formation history independent of local external perturbations , and another is to investigate the possible quenching or delay in star formation near the transition mass below which star formation is strongly suppressed .",
    "the most isolated galaxy previously observed with sufficient depth and resolution to distinguish the oldest main - sequence turnoff ( msto ) population is leo  a ( ddo  69 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a galaxy on the opposite side of the local group from aquarius , but with similar dynamical mass .",

    ", it is of great interest to know if the unusual sfh of leo  a presented in @xcite is an anomaly or a general feature of small , isolated galaxies . in this paper",

    "[ sec : pops ] .",
    "we derive the sfh of aquarius in  [ sec : sfh ] and compare its initial low level of star formation and sudden increase some 68  gyr ago to other local group dwarf galaxies in section  [ sec : disc ] .",
    "we put these reults into context with recent galaxy formation models in  [ sec : models ] .",
    "the aquarius dwarf galaxy was discovered on palomar sky survey prints by @xcite and identified by him as a low surface brightness , very blue galaxy at the limit of resolution into stars .",
    "based on the radial velocity of neutral hydrogen , @xcite identified aquarius as a possible local group member .",
    "aquarius is extremely isolated ; @xcite lists it as one of just three local group galaxies with a free - fall time to the local group barycenter larger than a hubble time given its radial velocity . currently only two other galaxies are known to lie within @xmath0500  kpc of aquarius ; these are sagdig at a distance of @xmath0340  kpc , and ngc  6822 , @xmath0440  kpc away .",

    "the consequent lack of bright , evolved stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite found two possible locations for the trgb and favored the more distant value of 1071 @xmath1339  kpc , arguing that smaller estimates could be the result of contamination of the brightest part of the red giant branch ( rgb ) by asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars .",
    "we adopted the more conservative distance in planning the present observations , but in the course of cmd modeling the best - fit solutions to the sfh were found to converge on a distance modulus of 24.95 @xmath130.10 ; this corresponds to a distance of 977 @xmath1345  kpc and is in good agreement with our preliminary analysis of the trgb magnitude in our data .",

    "aquarius was observed by hst under cycle 20 program go-12925 for 24 orbits spanning the time period between 2013 june 27 and june 30 . because of the low ecliptic latitude of aquarius ( @xmath32 = 4@xmath119 ) the observations were made when the angle between aquarius and the sun was near the optimum value of @xmath0135@xmath33 .",
    "the program was split into 12 visits of 2 orbits each in order to obtain enough separation between exposures to reliably identify short - period variable stars .",

    "we used a subpixel dither pattern between each exposure in order to facilitate cosmic ray rejection , but did not attempt to fill in the gap between the two acs / wfc chips since the fraction of stars lost in the gap is quite small .",
    "the total exposure times in ( f475w , f814w ) were ( 22,920 , 33,480 )  seconds .    a three - color composite image built from our co - added images is shown in figure  [ fig - image ] .",
    "this tends to highlight the brighter , bluer stars amongst the foreground stars and many background galaxies .",
    "no obvious nebulosities are present , consistent with the lack of current massive star formation in aquarius . while the distribution of young stars is clumpy and irregular , the red giants are more smoothly distributed , and extend out beyond the boundaries of the acs / wfc field @xcite .",
    "we obtained parallel images with the wfc3 camera and did not convincingly detect any aquarius members at that radius ( @xmath35 ) , in agreement with the density profile derived by @xcite .",

    "we performed an artificial star test analysis with 500,000 stars in order to characterize the measurement errors and incompleteness .",
    "artificial stars with the appropriate point spread function were added to the images with randomly chosen positions and magnitudes between 18 @xmath40 m@xmath41 @xmath40 31 and @xmath120.75 @xmath40 ( m@xmath42m@xmath43 ) @xmath40 3.50 and the images were re - photometered in identical fashion to the originals .",
    "the completeness is above 50% down to limits of ( m@xmath41 , m@xmath43 ) = ( 28.2 , 27.9 ) , reaching the oldest msto with high reliability . at these magnitude levels",
    "the typical photometric error is @xmath60.1  mag , allowing us to resolve the old stellar sequences and make comparisons to isochrone models with a high degree of precision .",
    "the resulting cmd is shown as a hess diagram in figure  [ fig - cmd ] .",
    "the cmd is dominated by a very narrow red giant branch that terminates at m@xmath43 = 21 and a main sequence indicating stars with a wide range of ages .",
    "we planned our observations using the conservative 1071  kpc distance estimate of @xcite , leading us to expect high completeness only down to the level of the oldest subgiants , but because aquarius is in fact @xmath00.2  mag closer than this , we were able to achieve 50% completeness at the level of the @xmath010  gyr msto .",
    "the stellar populations of aquarius have been studied several times over the past two decades , with increasing depth . @xcite",
    "made the first ccd - based study of the galaxy and commented on its extremely faint , low surface brightness nature .",
    "the most thorough study of the stellar populations of aquarius up to now has been the study of @xcite , who combined subaru and vlt data to study the red clump / horizontal branch for the first time , discovering that the cmd of the upper giant branch and red clump implied a young overall age for the galaxy , with most of the stars younger than 4@xmath44  gyr and fewer than 30% older than 10  gyr .",
    "our cmd is the deepest ever presented for aquarius by more than 3  magnitudes , opening a unique window on the intermediate - age ( 110  gyr ) and old ( @xmath3910  gyr ) stellar populations .",
    "major features in the luminosity function of the red giant branch are the very well defined red clump centered at m@xmath43 = 24.6 and the rgb bump at m@xmath43 = 24 .",
    "the well - defined rgb bump located above the red clump indicates that the dominant stellar population has a mean age quite a bit younger than the milky way globular clusters , but not a very high metallicity @xcite .",
    "there are very few bright agb stars above the rgb tip , consistent with the very low number of carbon stars reported by @xcite and @xcite , and suggesting that the dominant population is older than 12  gyr .",
    "the sequence of core helium - burning stars begins above the upper main sequence at m@xmath43 @xmath021 and continues downward and to the right through the red clump , reversing to form an extended horizontal branch .",
    "the continuity of these sequences shows immediately that while stars of all ages from ancient ( blue horizontal branch ) to @xmath610@xmath45 yr ( blue supergiants ) are present , aquarius is dominated by a population tending to the old side of intermediate age ( red clump / red horizontal branch ; * ? ? ?",
    "overall , the impression given by the cmd is of a sparsely populated , but in many ways typical , dwarf irregular that has formed stars more or less continuously over a hubble time .",
    "the upper main sequence , brighter than m@xmath43 @xmath0 24 , is sparsely sampled due to the low star formation rate and stochastic sampling of the initial mass function for stars of the corresponding intermediate and high masses .",
    "based on the low number of main sequence stars brighter than m@xmath43 @xmath022 , aquarius is experiencing a lull in star formation at present despite retaining enough gas to continue forming stars at a significant rate for several more gyr ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "a significant discovery in the context of this project is the blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) , detected as an extension of the red horizontal branch to colours m@xmath46 @xmath60.5 , overlapping the main sequence at magnitude m@xmath43 @xmath47 .",
    "these stars are unique signatures of an ancient , metal - poor stellar population , comparable to those seen in the classic satellite dwarf spheroidals of the milky way , for example the sculptor dsph @xcite , as well as in virtually all dwarf irregulars imaged to sufficient depth ( e.g. , ic1613 , * ? ? ?",
    "by contrast , leo  a was found to have virtually no bhb stars of its own @xcite , despite its similarity to aquarius in both _ present - day _ stellar @xcite and dynamical @xcite masses .",
    "rr  lyrae type variables are identified in the hst observations , and these stars represent a valuable independent probe of the distance and the metallicity of the oldest stellar populations .",
    "an analysis of the variable star populations , including the rr  lyraes , will be presented in a forthcoming paper . because the fraction of bhb stars does not trivially scale to relative sfr at ages @xmath010  gyr or older ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the degree to which the intermediate - age population is dominant , and the age and metallicity of the dominant populations , can not be determined from counts of stars on the bhb alone .",
    "the sfh presented here has been calculated using the code developed by cole , which has been used extensively on other local group dwarfs and tested against other methods with good consistency ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ", we use the padova - trieste ( parsec ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) isochrones .",
    "these are preferred because they have the most up to date input physics , include post - helium - core - flash phases of evolution , cover a wide range of age and metallicity at user - definable grid spacings , and are tuned to the revised solar oxygen abundance ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this specific choice plays a role in determining the precise age and duration of episodes of high or low sfr and the overall fit quality of the synthetic cmd , but the broad conclusions are robust against the choice of isochrone library owing to the depth of the photometry @xcite .",
    "the initial mass function is that of @xcite , which is a salpeter - like power law for m / m@xmath8 @xmath39 0.8 and log - normal for lower masses .",
    "binary stars are included as per the statistics presented in @xcite and @xcite , whereby 35% of the `` stars '' are single objects , and the rest are binary ; in turn , 25% of the binaries are defined as `` close '' binaries in which the secondary mass is drawn from a flat imf instead of the chabrier imf .",
    "the choice of imf and binary statistics may slightly alter the mass normalization of the solutions but do not significantly affect the shape of the derived sfh , as discussed extensively in @xcite and @xcite , among others . the distance and reddening",
    "were initially set to the values derived by @xcite , but were allowed to vary as demanded by the fitting procedure in order to best match the observed cmd .",
    "the stability of the solutions has been confirmed by comparison to fits made independently with different choice of imf and binary fraction , using the match software package @xcite .",
    "the isochrone library contains stars of ages between 6.60 @xmath40 log(age / yr ) @xmath40 10.12 , spaced by intervals of 0.01 , and metallicities from 1/150th to 1/10 solar , evenly spaced at intervals of @xmath00.15 in log(z ) .",
    "multiple metallicities are allowed at a given age and we do not impose an age - metallicity relation ( amr ; we do exclude metallicities above one - tenth solar from consideration ) .",
    "the isochrones at each metallicity are grouped into age bins in order to speed the computation ; the age bins are initially taken to be evenly spaced by 0.10 in log(age ) , but the bins may grow or shrink depending on the noise level in the solutions that may justify finer or coarser spacing .",
    "we adopted color and magnitude bins 0.05 and 0.10 mag wide , respectively . because the data quality is high , we model the region with @xmath48 and @xmath49 , but we have checked that our conclusions are not significantly altered if these limits are shifted to brighter magnitudes . the fitting procedure accepted the adopted reddening value of e(b@xmath12v ) = 0.05 and the @xcite distance modulus ( m@xmath12m)@xmath50 = 24.95 , but a good fit could not be found using the longer distance modulus from @xcite . as a check we performed a trgb fit and found good consistency for distances @xmath0977@xmath1345  kpc ; the distance issue will be explored further in our paper presenting the variable star light curves ( skillman et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the best - fit synthetic cmd is shown alongside the binned data in figure  [ fig - hessfit ] .",
    "the overall fit quality is very high , as shown by the residual significance plot in the righthand panel .",
    "the rgb color and breadth , the magnitude , color and morphology of the red clump , the upper main sequence color , and the location and slope of the sgb are all well - reproduced .",
    "the locations of the blue loop and red supergiant stars are indistinct due to the small number statistics and foreground contamination , but appears to be reasonable for metallicities z @xmath0 z@xmath19/20 .",
    "the independent fits made using match gave very similar solutions within the uncertainties .",
    "we present the lifetime sfh of aquarius in figure  [ fig - sfh ] .",
    "the major episode of star formation in aquarius took place @xmath068  gyr ago , although star formation has been continuous ( on gyr timescales ) over its entire lifetime .",
    "although star formation at the earliest times is low , it is inconsistent with zero .",
    "however , the drop in sfr between ages of 1012  gyr is robust and significant ; the sfr in this age bin is only nonzero at the @xmath02@xmath22 level .",
    "after the burst of activity at intermediate ages the sfr dropped , and has declined further over the past @xmath02  gyr .",
    "aquarius is one of the least luminous gas - rich galaxies in the local group , but it does extend beyond the footprint of the acs / wfc field ( 202@xmath51 ) .",
    "@xcite trace the structure out to at least a radius of 4@xmath52 , so our field only covers @xmath050% of the area over which aquarius stars are known .",
    "this is potentially problematic for interpreting the age of aquarius based on our sfh , given the ubiquity of age gradients and extended structures in even relatively isolated irregular galaxies for example , the case of sextans  a and b @xcite .",
    "it has already been noted that the young stars in aquarius are slightly off - center from the contours @xcite , which may be suggestive of a possible recent disturbance .    however , there is good reason to believe that our sfh is giving a nearly complete picture of the history of aquarius .",
    "the surface density profiles in @xcite drop exponentially , becoming indistinguishable from the foreground population at @xmath04@xmath53 along the major axis ; the equivalent distance along the minor axis is 2@xmath53 . @xcite give an exponential fit to the elliptical surface density profile of aquarius ; by integrating their profile over the area of the acs / wfc footprint , we find that 80% of the aquarius members",
    "brighter than v = 26 are contained in our field .",
    "the integral of our sfr(t ) over the hubble time gives a total astrated mass @xmath54 m@xmath8 ; based on the profiles from @xcite we may be missing @xmath55 m@xmath8 .",
    "even if _ all _ of the missed stars were formed prior to 10  gyr ago , then at the very most the derived full - galaxy sfh would show a time - averaged sfr from 1013.7  gyr of @xmath640% of the measured sfr from 68  gyr ago . even in this unrealistic `` oldest case '' scenario for the stars in the outskirts of aquarius , the galaxy as a whole",
    "would be dominated by intermediate age stars .    as a further check for possible population gradients , and to attempt to characterize the outer structure of aquarius , we obtained parallel imaging with the hst wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) simultaneously with our acs images of the central field .",
    "the wfc3 field is centered @xmath05.8@xmath52 ( 1.65  kpc ) from the center of the acs / wfc field , nearly along the major axis . despite a high degree of completeness down to magnitude @xmath028",
    ", we were unable to identify any sign of the stellar sequences in aquarius in these images . at",
    "most a few aquarius stars per square arcminute could be in the wfc3 field ; unless the stellar distribution is highly asymmetric and we have been very unlucky in our parallel field placement , no significant population of aquarius stars is present at radii @xmath55@xmath52 ( 1.4  kpc ) , down to very strict limits around the old main sequence turnoff .",
    "the metallicity evolution of aquarius is summarized in figure  [ fig - amr ] , and is in excellent agreement with the spectroscopic metallicities reported by @xcite and with the photometric estimates in @xcite .",
    "the errorbars in fig .",
    "[ fig - amr ] show the rms of the mass - weighted metallicity in each age bin ; because the isochrone models are separated by discrete intervals of @xmath00.150.20 log metallicity , the errorbars are typically about this size , except where a very wide range of metallicities are required to reproduce the cmd , as in the oldest age bins .",
    "the wide metallicity range for ages @xmath58  gyr likely reflects both the rapid early increase in metallicity and the small number of stars in the cmd at those ages . because of the rather coarse age resolution at the earliest times , we are unable to unambiguously assign an age to the youngest major populations with z @xmath37 0.01z@xmath19 .",
    "after the period of rapid early enrichment , ubiquitous in synthetic cmd solutions for dwarf galaxies , the metallicity remains nearly constant over time , slowly rising to a value of @xmath0z@xmath8/20 , fairly typical for dwarf galaxies of this luminosity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the mean metallicity at intermediate ages is in good agreement with the local group dwarf galaxy stellar mass - metallicity relationships reported by @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "narrowband imaging and optical spectroscopy at h@xmath9 by @xcite revealed no current massive star formation activity , even though the presence of bright blue main sequence and evolved stars proves that star formation has occurred within the past 10@xmath45 yr .",
    "aquarius is one of the faintest , lowest star formation rate ( sfr ) galaxies in the 11hugs sample of gas - rich , star - forming galaxies within 11  mpc @xcite , with a large discrepancy between the inferred h@xmath9 and far - ultraviolet sfr owing to the flickering nature of star formation in dwarf irregulars , combined with stochastic sampling of the initial mass function ( imf ) at low sfr @xcite .",
    "a higher resolution view of the sfh over the past 1  gyr is shown in figure  [ fig - recent ] .",
    "aquarius is in a period of low sfr , with seemingly random fluctuations on timescales of @xmath010@xmath45  yr .",
    "the recent drop in activity after an upward fluctuation is in excellent agreement with the estimates of current sfr reported in @xcite , whose uv ( @xmath56100  myr sensitivity ; dashed line ) and h@xmath9 ( @xmath5610  myr sensitivity ; circled star ) results are overplotted on figure  [ fig - recent ] .",
    "the enhancement at ages of 250300  myr has been noted by previous authors as discussed above , and is identifiable here by the increased density of blue loop stars at m@xmath43 @xmath022 .",
    "it is natural to interpret this increase in sfr lasting several tens of myr as a stochastic fluctuation in sfr of the type frequently observed in dwarf galaxies , leading to the wide variety of h@xmath9 , uv , and ir star formation indicators in dwarf galaxies where the gas densities and total mass participating in star formation are small ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the event is of shorter duration than a typical episode that would be identified as a dwarf galaxy starburst @xcite .",
    "the isolation of aquarius means that it has never been affected by tidal encounters with the milky way or m31 , and so it is highly unlikely that it was of much higher mass in the distant past .",
    "this removes one complicating factor in the interpretation of the sfhs of close satellites , which may have been of much higher mass in the distant past than they are now ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "presumably the difference in metallicity may be related back to the more gas - rich nature of leo  a , which is a factor of 23 more gas rich than aquarius @xcite and therefore less chemically evolved . at the oldest ages ,",
    "aquarius did not just form stars at a higher relative rate than leo  a , but had a higher absolute star formation rate ( a fact that is reflected in its much more prominent blue horizontal branch ) .",
    "all other galaxies with comparably deep cmds ( in absolute magnitude ) are much closer to the milky way and therefore complicated by the possibility that past interactions have strongly influenced their sfh .",
    "@xcite shows that the irregular and transition type galaxies ic  1613 , leo  t , phoenix , and lgs-3 are all at least a factor of two closer to a massive spiral than aquarius . the isolated systems wlm and sagittarius dig have been surveyed with wfpc2 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but not to a depth sufficient to resolve the oldest msto ; the deepest acs data for ugc  4879 reach the level of the red clump @xcite .    the non - satellite dwarf spheroidals tucana and cetus are somewhat different .",
    "they differ from the gas - rich galaxies in their star formation histories ; this may or may not be related to a proposed history of tidal interactions ( * ? ? ?",

    "* for tucana and cetus respectively ) .",
    "nevertheless while interactions _ may _ be suspected for tucana and cetus ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the timing and identity of the main tidal perturber can not be established with confidence .",
    "they are included here for completeness .",
    "most of the local group dwarf galaxies show either nearly constant long - term average sfr , or are dominated by much older bursts .",
    "the latter pattern is more common in the nearby satellites of the milky way and m31 and among the lowest - luminosity systems .",
    "the tucana and cetus dwarf spheroidals are nearly pure ancient populations ( albeit with ages differing by @xmath01  gyr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the dwarf irregular galaxies , which statistically tend to be found at large distances from both m31 and the milky way , show more uniform sfrs over cosmic time .",
    "the prototypical example with comparable acs data could be ic  1613 , a far larger galaxy ( m@xmath14 = @xmath1215.2 ) which shows nearly constant sfr @xcite . at the other end of the mass scale , leo  t (",
    "m@xmath14 = @xmath128 ) is observed to show a slowly declining sfr beginning at the earliest times and continuing until @xmath025  myr ago without dramatic variation @xcite .    from figure  [ fig - thepoint ] , we see that there is a wide range of observed sfhs at a given galaxy mass .",
    "these galaxies are not satellites of either the milky way or m31 , so no tidal or ram pressure quenching of star formation is expected , and indeed most of the systems show extended star forming lifetimes . among the galaxies with a freefall time onto either the milky way or m31 less than a hubble time , no examples of significantly delayed peak sfr are found .",
    "leo  a and aquarius , the two most isolated galaxies in the sample , on the other hand , simmer for at least 34  gyr after reionization before dramatically increasing their sfr .",
    "present - day isolation can not be the sole factor determining the early sfh , however , because the similarly distant and similarly massive dwarf spheroidals , cetus and tucana , have the _ highest _ fraction of stars older than 10  gyr among the galaxies in our sample .",
    "the comparison to other local group galaxies serves to reinforce the point that there is no simple relationship between current galaxy mass , isolation , and age of the main stellar population ; it is physically intuitive to suppose that such a relationship would be clarified if the complete history of interaction and feedback heating for each galaxy could be known .",
    "if there are any trends , it seems that major star formation events are more evenly distributed in redshift than in lookback time , and galaxies with low baryonic mass are more prone to bursty behavior than more massive and/or gas - rich systems .",
    "a significant amount of recent progress has been made in cosmological structure formation models describing the formation and early evolution of dwarf galaxies .",
    "the gains in numerical resolution and treatment of various radiative and hydrodynamical effects are reflected in simulated galaxies that plausibly resemble observed dwarfs .    in the most thoroughly studied galaxies ,",
    "their proximity means that environmental effects arising from close passages to the milky way must be considered when interpreting the sfh .",
    "this has weakened inferences about the effects of the uv background or internal feedback on the sfh of dwarfs . while the hypothesized effects are expected to be strongest for the lowest - mass galaxies , most of the extremely low - luminosity ( `` ultrafaint '' ) dwarfs are deep within the milky way potential well and therefore present an undesirable degree of complexity despite being the obvious place to test for feedback or photoionization heating .",
    "aquarius and leo  a have certainly never had a close flyby of either m31 or the milky way , and have likely never been within the virial radius of either galaxy @xcite ; they are the two best `` clean '' galaxies we have for comparison to model predictions .",
    "@xcite trace the assembly of dark matter halos beginning with 10@xmath18  m@xmath8 clumps at redshift @xmath80 = 15 and find that the merger rate is approximately constant _ per unit redshift _ , which means that typical dwarfs assembled most of their mass at very high lookback time .",
    "their examination of the millennium simulation finds that the median redshift of last major merger for 10@xmath7  m@xmath19 halos is @xmath80 = 3.4 ( t@xmath81 = 11.8  gyr ) .",
    "the sfh derived assuming that sfr follows accretion rate for a typical halo from @xcite is shown as the smooth curve in figure  [ fig - thepoint ] .",
    "while the median dwarf is expected to form early , @xcite also find a broad distribution of accretion rates at all redshifts for small halos .",
    "their models predict that for halos with present - day virial mass 10@xmath7  m@xmath19 , roughly 1 in 3 experienced their last major merger after @xmath80 = 2 , and about 1 in 6 since @xmath80 = 1 .",
    "the implication is that while late accretion is not the _ most _ likely evolutionary path for a dwarf galaxy the size of aquarius , it is far from _",
    "the fact that _ both _ of the first two isolated dwarfs to have been studied in sufficient detail show just such delays leads to the impression that either long delays are more common in isolated galaxies than in the galaxy population as a whole , or that star formation does not track dark matter accretion .",
    "if late mergers are the explanation for the delayed sfh , then neither component of a major merger could have had a dominant ancient stellar population .    while a simple prescription for baryon ( re)heating after reionization might predict the complete quenching of star formation in dwarf galaxies at redshifts @xmath80 @xmath06 , there is little evidence in the sfhs of observed galaxies for such a quenching @xcite .",
    "rather , the effects of reionization , if any , appear to be more subtle ; note in figure  [ fig - thepoint ] that no isolated local group dwarf begins vigorously forming stars within 12  gyr after the end of reionization . while star formation does not appear to be quenched",
    ", an argument could be made that it is at least dampened by the uv photoheating : every galaxy in figure  [ fig - thepoint ] has a lower rate of star formation immediately after the end of reionization than before .",
    "cast in the framework of hierarchical galaxy assembly in a @xmath82cdm cosmology , it appears likely that the accretion history of baryons in aquarius either differs significantly from that of the dark matter , or baryonic physics has disrupted the one - to - one link between mass accretion and star formation .",
    "the observed complexity of these relationships has proven challenging for non - fully cosmological models to capture , and predictions for stellar and dark matter mass growth are not always in agreement with observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the left panel shows six isolated model dwarfs from the hydrodynamical simulations of @xcite .",
    "the simulated galaxies have a dark matter halo mass of @xmath010@xmath7  m@xmath19 , comparable to or a bit larger than aquarius . in the simulations ,",
    "star formation is suppressed by the combined effects of feedback and reionization , but unlike aquarius and leo  a , the sfr never recovers . despite an advanced cooling and star formation treatment , the simulations form the majority of their stars before @xmath80 @xmath02 because sfr tracks the accretion rate .",
    "the simulated galaxies also form a minimum of an order of magnitude too much stellar mass compared to the observed dwarfs ( 510@xmath1710@xmath84  m@xmath19 ; for comparison see table  [ tab : compare ] ) .",
    "even more recent models are shown in the right hand panel .",
    "the dashed lines show the three galaxies in the simulations of @xcite that have produced on the order of 10@xmath85  m@xmath19 worth of stars , similar to aquarius .",
    "these simulated isolated dwarfs are gas - rich ( m@xmath3/m@xmath4 @xmath381 ) , dark matter - dominated , and have experienced a bursty sfh .",
    "the most gas - rich , lowest stellar - mass dwarf is an obvious comparison object to leo  a , with some initial star formation prior to the end of reionization , followed by a long fallow period and a late burst .",
    "the other two simulated dwarfs also show an initial epoch of star formation with a post - reionization drought , although star formation restarts after a much briefer delay .",
    "@xcite conclude that some _ isolated _ dwarfs are capable of retaining gas without forming stars for several gyr .",
    "a complete analysis of the relationship between mass accretion , feedback , gas cooling , and sfr in these simulations will be presented in a forthcoming paper ( weisz et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , but the general agreement is quite promising and may indicate that a critical threshold in resolution has been crossed .",
    "the solid lines in the right - hand panel of figure  [ fig - models ] show the results of @xcite , whose high - resolution smooth - particle hydrodynamical model also shows that the combination of reionization and the mechanical energy input by supernova feedback is critical to the prevention of gas cooling in small halos .",
    "they make a strong prediction that halos with total mass @xmath610@xmath86  m@xmath8 never manage to cool enough to form stars ; this threshold is just below the expected virial masses of aquarius and leo  a. four of their simulated galaxies span the range of plausible masses for our isolated dwarfs .",
    "the nearly constant sfr dwarfs `` bashful '' and `` doc '' inhabit more massive halos of @xmath013@xmath1710@xmath7  m@xmath19 . in figure  [ fig - models ] , these galaxies have formed the bulk of their stars far earlier than aquarius or leo  a , and have also formed over an order of magnitude more stellar mass that the isolated local group dwarfs .",
    "the other two star - forming galaxies from @xcite , `` dopey '' and `` grumpy '' , are at the lower end of the applicable halo mass range , and present a stark contrast to the more massive systems : they are extremely gas - rich and have formed 12 orders of magnitude fewer stars than aquarius or leo  a. the low - mass simulated dwarfs exhibit a highly bursty sfh , and are characterized by an extreme delay of star formation neither galaxy experiences _ any _ star formation until very recently , making them exaggerated versions of leo  a. the variance in sfh between any two given galaxies of similar total mass indicates a large degree of stochasticity in all three models considered here , a phenomenon which is also expected in the models of , for example , @xcite and others .    the fact that realistic small galaxies form at all in the simulations represents an encouraging sign of progress , but there are still significant discrepancies .",
    "a lingering sign of the overcooling problem is that the extrapolated @xcite nfw profile mass for aquarius is @xmath010@xmath7 , similar to the shen s `` bashful '' and `` doc '' , but these produce ten times as much stellar mass as aquarius and still have a very large amount of gas left over .",
    "scaling the mass down by 0.51 order of magnitude for the other two simulated galaxies reduces the number of stars formed by 23 orders of magnitude , indicating that we are in a mass range where the feedback and star formation efficiency prescriptions are exceptionally sensitive to halo mass .",
    "by contrast , the most and least massive galaxies in figure  [ fig - compare ] ( ic  1613 and leo  t , respectively ) share broadly similar patterns of relative star formation rate , are both gas - rich at the present time , and are both older than the intermediate - mass galaxies aquarius and leo  a.",
    "we have measured the star formation history of the aquarius dwarf galaxy based on photometry extending to the oldest main - sequence turnoff obtained with the hst advanced camera for surveys .",
    "we have fit the photometric data using the method of creating synthetic color - magnitude diagrams based on theoretical isochrones and a maximum - likelihood comparison .",
    "we have found that aquarius is dominated by stars aged less than 10  gyr , and that metallicity evolution over the past @xmath010  gyr has been mild .",
    "we find in particular the following major features :    1 .",
    "the sfh is not consistent with a strong , early burst of star formation prior to the end of reionization .",
    "however , a significant population of stars older than 10  gyr is present based on the sfh , the magnitude extent of the subgiant branch , and the detection of a blue horizontal branch .",
    "the first major episode of star formation began @xmath08  gyr ago and lasted for @xmath02  gyr .",
    "star formation has lasted for the full age of the universe , with no evidence for long breaks between active periods .",
    "apart from the increase at 8  gyr , the sfh is almost consistent with a constant lifetime sfr . in this sense aquarius resembles leo  a , which is similarly isolated and of comparable mass , but experienced an even stronger delay .",
    "the presence of an old stellar population amounting to 4@xmath1710@xmath87  m@xmath8 in place prior to redshift @xmath80 = 3 was evidently not accompanied by sufficient feedback to quench subsequent star formation .",
    "aquarius is the most isolated galaxy for which the full sfh has been measured with high precision and accuracy based on photometry reaching the oldest msto ; it therefore makes an ideal test case to benchmark the evolution of small galaxies in isolation .",
    "either aquarius experienced a `` slow drip '' accretion history , in which gas trickled in over several gigayears before reaching a threshhold density for star formation , or feedback effects on the gas have decoupled the star formation rate from the gas accretion rate .",
    "the differences between aquarius and leo  a suggest that some combination of inefficient cooling in small halos , heating due to feedback , and/or a stochastic history of baryon accretion is necessary to understand the evolution of the smallest galaxies . because of the high level of variance observed in the sfh of isolated dwarf galaxies to date , observations of additional galaxies to comparable photometric depth will be necessary in order to begin to map correlations in the space of total mass , baryon fraction , angular momentum , and environment .",

    "<S> we have obtained deep images of the highly isolated ( d = 1  mpc ) aquarius dwarf irregular galaxy ( ddo  210 ) with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) . the resulting color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) reaches more than a magnitude below the oldest main - sequence turnoff , allowing us to derive the star formation history ( sfh ) over the entire lifetime of the galaxy with a timing precision of @xmath010% of the lookback time . using a maximum likelihood fit to the cmd </S>",
    "<S> we find that only @xmath010% of all star formation in aquarius took place more than 10  gyr ago ( lookback time equivalent to redshift @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the star formation rate increased dramatically @xmath068  gyr ago ( @xmath20.71.1 ) and then declined until the present time . </S>",
    "<S> the only known galaxy with a more extreme confirmed delay in star formation is leo  a , a galaxy of similar m@xmath3/m@xmath4 , dynamical mass , mean metallicity , and degree of isolation . </S>",
    "<S> the delayed stellar mass growth in these galaxies does not track the mean dark matter accretion rate from cdm simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the similarities between leo  a and aquarius suggest that if gas is not removed from dwarf galaxies by interactions or feedback , it can linger for several gigayears without cooling in sufficient quantity to form stars efficiently . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss possible causes for the delay in star formation including suppression by reionization and late - time mergers . </S>",
    "<S> we find reasonable agreement between our measured sfhs and select cosmological simulations of isolated dwarfs . because star formation and merger processes are both stochastic in nature , delayed star formation in various degees is predicted to be a characteristic ( but not a universal ) feature of isolated small galaxies . </S>"
