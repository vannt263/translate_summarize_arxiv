    "recovery of the primordial distribution of density perturbations is crucial to understanding the origin of large - scale structure .",
    "inflation , possibly the most promising paradigm for the origin of structure , predicts gaussian initial conditions ( ics ) , while most alternative models generally predict some deviation from gaussianity .",
    "it is well known that gravitational instability will induce non - gaussianity in an initially gaussian distribution of cosmological perturbations , as the nonlinear collapse process gives rise to interactions between initially uncoupled modes and thus to non - zero higher - order moments .",
    "as fluctuations become nonlinear on progressively larger scales , larger objects become virialized , producing a hierarchy of structure . in the quasi - linear ( ql ) regime , where the rms fluctuations are small compared to unity , perturbative solutions to the fluid equations for a self - gravitating pressureless fluid in an expanding universe can be used to derive the resulting @xmath8-point correlation functions ( cfs ) and their fourier - space counterparts , the polyspectra , induced by gravitational instability ( peebles 1980 ; fry 1984 ; goroff 1986 ) .",
    "in particular , the three - point correlation function ( 3pcf ) , or equivalently , its fourier transform ( ft ) , the bispectrum , is the lowest - order intrinsically nonlinear statistic and can therefore place strong constraints on models of structure formation - point cfs are valid statistics only if the universe is homogeneous on large scales ( as opposed to exhibiting , say , multi - fractal structure ) .",
    "we invoke the assumptions of large - scale homogeneity and isotropy , so that the cfs depend only relative distances and are independent of orientation . ] .    the perturbation - theory ( pt )",
    "calculation predicts so - called hierarchical behavior of the polyspectra , whereby those of higher order can be simply related to the power spectrum , since the physics on ql scales is still determined entirely by the ics . in the case of the bispectrum , @xmath9 , \\label{b}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the power spectrum and",
    "@xmath11 is of order unity and depends only on the magnitudes , @xmath12 , of the three wave vectors forming a triangle in @xmath13-space .",
    "( fry 1984 ; goroff 1986 ) .",
    "a similar form was proposed , on purely empirical grounds , by peebles ( 1974 , 1975 , 1980 ) for the spatial 3pcf , @xmath14 , \\label{zeta}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the two - point correlation function ( 2pcf ) and the normalized amplitude , @xmath4 , depends only on the physical separations , @xmath16 , of the three points in real space given by coordinates @xmath17 , and is assumed to be of order unity .",
    "it should be noted that though many authors assume @xmath4 to be a constant , this is strictly untrue , nor is @xmath4 given by the @xmath13-space @xmath18 ; rather it is a function defined by equation  ( [ zeta ] ) , independent of the validity of the hierarchical model .",
    "a related , more tractable statistic which is commonly used is the normalized spatial skewness , @xmath19 , related to @xmath4 evaluated at zero lag for a distribution smoothed over an effective scale half - width @xmath20 .",
    "studies of the spatial 3pcfs of different tracer populations on small scales ( i.e. , below 10 @xmath3 mpc ) have generally yielded results consistent with the assumed hierarchical form above , i.e. , values of @xmath21 ( groth & peebles 1977 ; jing & zhang 1989 ; tth , hollsi , & szalay 1989 ; gott , gao , & park 1991 ; jing , mo , & brner 1991 ; baumgart & fry 1991 ; bouchet 1993 ; jing & brner 1998 ) and values of @xmath0 of order a few ( gaztaaga 1992 ; bouchet 1993 ; cappi & maurogordato 1995 ; gaztaaga , croft , & dalton 1995 ) , and numerical simulations have also lent support to the hierarchical model ( bouchet , schaeffer , & davis 1991 ; fry , melott , & shandarin 1993 , 1995 ; bernardeau 1994a ; baugh , gaztaaga , & efstathiou 1995 ; colombi , bouchet , & hernquist 1996 ) . at larger scales , however , the detailed behavior of these higher - order statistics , such as the configuration - dependence of @xmath4 , is not well constrained .",
    "often , results for @xmath4 are quoted as constant simply because they reflect averages over all geometries , thus wiping out valuable information .",
    "jing & brner ( 1997 , hereafter jb97 ) and matsubara & suto ( 1994 ) do investigate the shape dependence of @xmath4 , but find substantial disagreement between the predictions of ql pt and those of @xmath5-body simulations .",
    "jing & brner ( 1998 ) further find significant devations between the observed configuration dependence of @xmath22 , the projected @xmath4 perpendicular to the line of sight , and the standard hierarchical result .",
    "these differences may be attributable to various mechanisms , such as nonlinear effects , finite volume effects , and projection effects , which can reduce the configuration dependence of both observed and @xmath5-body results for @xmath4 , as compared with ql pt predictions .",
    "the observed discrepancies , however , might also suggest that problems exist in the definition of @xmath4 .",
    "that the normalized amplitudes @xmath4 and @xmath0 have been observed to exhibit roughly stable values near unity , as predicted , over scales on which @xmath1 and @xmath23 individually vary by many orders of magnitude , has been interpreted as loose support for the scenario of gravitational evolution of gaussian ics .",
    "it is clear , however , that the uncertainties in theoretical models , as well as in the data , are still appreciable . much of this uncertainty is due to the fact that existing redshift surveys have not been both large and deep enough to yield strong constraints , particularly on ql scales .",
    "however , with the advent of new , deep surveys at various wavelengths ( radio , optical , infra - red , x - ray ) , probing many different populations ( galaxies , quasars , clusters , etc . ) , a rapidly growing database of spectroscopic and photometric redshifts , and powerful new computing resources , it will soon be possible to achieve precise measurements of higher - order spatial cfs .",
    "interpreting the data from these upcoming surveys will require more realistic modeling of a variety of effects which may enter into the theoretical calculations .",
    "for example , the 3pcf can depend on the detailed form of the power spectrum ( frieman & gaztaaga 1994 ; jb97 ) and , particularly for the case of angular cfs ( see buchalter , kamionkowski , & jaffe 1999 , hereafter bkj ) , on the density of nonrelativistic matter , the cosmological constant , @xmath24 , or the density of some other form of matter ( bouchet 1992 ; bernardeau 1994a ; bouchet 1995 ; catelan 1995 ; martel 1995 ; scoccimarro 1998 ; kamionkowski & buchalter 1998 ) . furthermore , smoothing of the density field , as occurs when determining @xmath0 from the moments of counts - in - cells , must be taken into account ( bernardeau 1994a , b ) .",
    "perhaps most importantly , however , biasing of the tracer population will have a significant effect on the observed 3pcf ( fry 1984 ; fry & gaztaaga 1993 , hereafter fg93 ) .    bias  the notion that observed structures do not exactly trace the underlying density field  is advocated by both theory and observations , and may in general be scale and/or time dependent . in deterministic models , the fractional density perturbation @xmath25 of the unsmoothed tracer - mass distribution",
    "may be expanded in terms of the perturbation @xmath26 to the total mass distribution , @xmath27 ^ 2 + \\cdots , \\label{dexp}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the linear bias term , @xmath29 the first nonlinear term , etc . , and @xmath30 is itself written as @xmath31 where @xmath32 , @xmath33 is the linear solution , and @xmath34 is the leading - order departure from the gaussian ics .",
    "note that the bias terms defined above are scale - independent , since equation  ( [ dexp ] ) is a local relation between the unsmoothed density fields at every point ( we comment further on this assumption below ) .",
    "like gravitational evolution or primordial skewness , the existence of nonlinear bias will also give rise to a non - zero third moment in the present - day density distribution of the tracer mass ( since the 3pcf is intrinsically second order , and thus requires the @xmath29 term in the pt calculation ) .",
    "these effects can not be reliably distinguished by present data . furthermore , though gaussian ics are sufficient to produce hierarchical behavior , they are not necessary ; even if the data are shown to follow the predicted hierarchy to high accuracy , it is possible that this result is merely a coincidence of the bias .",
    "the impact of bias and its variation ( thought to be primarily with redshift ) on the 3pcf must therefore be taken into account if the predictions of gaussian ics are to be tested unambiguously .",
    "it has been shown that the detailed behavior of the 3pcf can constrain the initial density profile ( fry & scherrer 1994 ; heavens 1998 ) , distinguish between contributions to clustering from gravitational collapse vs. bias ( szalay 1988 ; fg93 ; fry 1994 ; frieman & gaztaaga 1994 ) and , for a given tracer population , yield determinations of the linear and nonlinear bias parameters ( frieman & gaztaaga 1994 ; gaztaaga & frieman 1994 ; jing 1997 ; matarrese , verde , & heavens 1997 ) . moreover , if different populations , such as clusters and galaxies , are differently biased relative to the underlying mass distribution , then measuring the 3pcfs of these populations can provide multiple , independent constraints .",
    "several authors have recently argued that bias , and its evolution , is the dominant consideration in evaluating structure - formation models against clustering data , and have pointed to the need for employing more sophisticated bias models than the simplest ones often used ( i.e. , local , linear , and non - evolving ) ( jb97 , jing & brner 1998 ; bernardeau 1995 ; matarrese 1997 ) .    in this paper , we calculate the normalized spatial skewness , @xmath19 , and normalized 3pcf , @xmath35 , in the ql regime assuming gaussian ics .",
    "we consider open and flat cosmological models with arbitrary allowed values of @xmath7 and @xmath36 , and take into account the dependence on the detailed form and evolution of the cdm power spectrum .",
    "we further include the effect of linear and nonlinear bias , and in particular , their time evolution , via an extension of the fry ( 1996 ) bias - evolution model to the case of an arbitrary expansion history ( bkj perform similar calculations to obtain corresponding results for the angular skewness and 3pcf ) . for comparison , we derive the results for @xmath0 with a power - law spectrum , including a scale - dependent , leading - order correction to the standard expression for @xmath0 ( fg93 ) in the case of a nonlinear bias as defined in equation  ( [ dexp ] ) .",
    "this correction term becomes appreciable for positive effective spectral indices , corresponding to scales @xmath37 @xmath3 mpc for cdm models .",
    "the existence of this term implies that the value of the nonlinear - bias parameter , as defined for _ smoothed _ density fields , could in general depend on the adopted smoothing scale . for a given cdm model , this dependence , in principle , would allow a more accurate determination of the linear- and nonlinear - bias parameters on the basis of skewness measurements alone , provided however , that @xmath0 could be measured over sufficiently large scales .",
    "we show that @xmath4 is a poorly - defined statistic , exhibiting rapid variation and divergences which do not arise from the behavior of the 3pcf itself , but are rather due to the quantity @xmath38 $ ] in equation  ( [ zeta ] ) acquiring values of or near zero in various cases [ the @xmath13-space defined in equation  ( [ b ] ) is not subject to this normalization problem ] .",
    "this dramatic behavior of @xmath4 is in marked contrast to that predicted by some @xmath5-body simulations ( jb97 ; matsubara & suto 1994 ) and we propose that this discrepancy is due at least in part to the practical inability to measure cfs to high precision near zero .",
    "we suggest that this may be addressed by considering @xmath5-body results for @xmath4 at earlier epochs , where nonlinear effects can be safely ignored ; to avoid this problem altogether , we define the variance - normalized 3pcf , @xmath6 , given by @xmath1 divided by the square of the variance at a given scale .",
    "we find that @xmath0 and @xmath6 do indeed depend strongly on the bias scheme , as has been suggested .",
    "in particular , a significant linear ( nonlinear ) bias term produces a relative decrease ( increase ) in both normalized amplitudes , and a significant linear term is found to reduce the variation of @xmath0 with smoothing scale and of @xmath6 with triangle geometry , as compared with the unbiased predictions .",
    "while @xmath0 is found to be only mildly sensitive to the cosmological parameters , @xmath6 can vary appreciably with the value of the parameter @xmath39 , determined by the epoch of matter - radiation equality , that locates the peak in the power spectrum .",
    "in general , @xmath6 is found to depend strongly on the triangle geometry , with smaller , elongated structures , corresponding to filaments or sheets , being more strongly clustered .",
    "the rich configuration dependence of the 3pcf is shown to break the degeneracy present in @xmath0 on scales @xmath40 @xmath3 mpc , between the cosmological parameters and in particular the constant linear- and nonlinear - bias parameters .",
    "both statistics , however , are unable to distinguish well between models of evolving and non - evolving bias , since an evolving bias effectively acts as a smaller , constant bias .",
    "we show that measurements of bias evolution , as well as of @xmath7 and the epoch of galaxy formation , could potentially be isolated by considering @xmath1 as a function of redshift in a very deep ( @xmath41 ) survey . alternatively , bkj show that similar results can be obtained more feasibly from measurements of the angular 3pcf .",
    "the results below are based on leading - order pt and are thus restricted to the ql regime , where @xmath42 . though the leading - order contributions to higher moments of the density distribution are appreciable at these scales , higher - order nonlinear contributions are not expected to be significant , and various authors have shown that observations and simulations in this regime are well - matched by leading - order results alone ( szalay 1988 ; tth , hollsi , & szalay 1989 ; gott , gao , & park 1991 ; bouchet , schaeffer , & davis 1991 ; fry , melott , & shandarin 1993 , 1995 ; colombi , bouchet , & hernquist 1996 ; scoccimarro 1998 ) .",
    "in addition , numerical simulations suggest that large scales still obey leading - order pt even when small scales have become fully nonlinear ( bouchet & hernquist 1992 ; fry , melott , & shandarin 1995 ) , and further that the results of ql pt hold even on scales where the rms fluctuation is @xmath43 ( bernardeau 1994a ; baugh , gaztaaga , & efstathiou 1995 ; fry , melott , & shandarin 1995 ) .",
    "we wish to derive an expression for the normalized 3pcf , @xmath4 , defined in equation  ( [ zeta ] ) , for a distribution of tracer masses , such as galaxies , clusters , or radio sources .",
    "this quantity has the advantage that it is independent of the overall normalization of the power spectrum .",
    "the full spatial 3pcf is given by @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the comoving position and @xmath46/\\overline{\\rho}(t_0)$ ] is the present fractional perturbation to the unsmoothed tracer - mass density .",
    "although the spatial 3pcf is nominally the function of nine quantities , statistical homogeneity and isotropy guarantee that the 3pcf depends only on three parameters which may be taken to be , e.g. , the three distances between the three points .",
    "still , evaluating @xmath4 over all allowed configurations may be fairly complicated , so it has become increasingly popular to focus instead on the normalized skewness @xmath47 .",
    "this statistic is likewise independent of the power - spectrum normalization and is far easier to calculate than its full @xmath8-point counterpart , while still preserving much of the information contained therein .    in practice ,",
    "@xmath25 can not be evaluated continuously , since the observed tracer - mass distribution is discrete , so we define @xmath48 to be the density contrast smoothed over a cell with an effective comoving scale half - width @xmath20 . , where @xmath8 is the number of discrete counts . ]",
    "in particular , we shall choose a spherical top - hat window function ; in terms of the fourier components , @xmath49 , of the unsmoothed density field , @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the ft of the three - dimensional spherical top - hat window function and @xmath52 is a bessel function of order @xmath8 .",
    "since we are working in the regime where @xmath53 , fluctuations at or below the smoothing scale will not significantly affect our results ( bernardeau 1994a , b ; see  3 ) .",
    "the counts - in - cells spatial 2pcf is then given by @xmath54 the power spectrum of the tracer mass , @xmath55 , is defined via @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the dirac delta function and @xmath58 . putting this into equation  ( [ xi ] ) , we have @xmath59 where one integral vanishes under the requirement @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and we have made use of the the even symmetry of the window function .",
    "taking @xmath62 , we obtain an expression for the variance , @xmath63 the linear solution to the equations of motion for the underlying density contrast has the separable form , @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the linear - theory growth factor , given ( as a function of redshift ) by @xmath66 ^ 3 } , \\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\ ;       e(z ) = \\sqrt{\\sum_i \\omega_i ( 1+z)^{3(1+w_i ) } } , \\label{d}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 and @xmath68 represents the contribution to the overall energy density from species @xmath69 having equation of state @xmath70 ; to the total energy density , and yields the term @xmath71 in the sum in equation  ( [ d ] ) ; thus , in a universe with , for example , a ratio of nonrelativistic - matter density to closure density of @xmath7 and a cosmological - constant contribution to the total density of @xmath36 , @xmath72 . ] for an einstein de - sitter universe , @xmath65 is simply the scale factor , @xmath73 .",
    "one can then see from equation  ( [ p ] ) that the spatial and time dependence of the power spectrum can likewise be separated .",

    "the @xmath118 term [ which arises from the term proportional to @xmath29 in equation  ( [ skewness2 ] ) ] reflects the effect of the smoothing filter on the biased , contiguous field , @xmath25 , defined in equation  ( [ dexp ] ) .",
    "the filter is designed to separate smooth , large - scale fluctuations from the nonlinear , small - scale field . however",
    ", a nonlinear distribution having a scale - free power spectrum with @xmath116 contains so much small - scale power that the deviations induced by smoothing over these small - scale fluctuations become comparable to , or greater than , the perturbations above the smoothing scale , thus leading to the divergence in @xmath118 .",
    "the form of equation  ( [ s3 ] ) agrees with the previously known scale - free result for @xmath0 for a constant , nonlinear bias ( bouchet 1992 ; juszkiewicz , bouchet , & colombi 1993 ; fg93 ; bernardeau 1994a ; fry 1994 ) , with the exception of the @xmath118 term .",
    "this difference arises from the fact that other authors calculating higher - order moments of the smoothed tracer - mass field ( e.g. , fg93 ) typically define the bias parameters using the form of equation  ( [ dexp ] ) to relate the _ smoothed _ tracer - mass and total - mass fields , i.e. , @xmath119 where the @xmath120 are the `` smoothed bias '' terms and a subscripted @xmath20 again denotes a smoothed field .",
    "biasing and smoothing do not commute ; whereas the unsmoothed bias parameters we define in equation  ( [ dexp ] ) are truly local and scale - independent , the definition of bias in equation  ( [ dexpr ] ) is inherently non - local , only fixing the smoothed bias parameters at the chosen smoothing scale . while it can be shown , using perturbation theory , that @xmath121 , the higher - order smoothed bias terms will in general be different from their constant - valued counterparts in equation  ( [ dexp ] ) , and the magnitude of the difference will depend on the scale on which the @xmath120 are defined .",
    "had we used the smoothed bias parameters as defined in equation  ( [ dexpr ] ) , we would recover the result of fg93 , i.e. , equation  ( [ s3 ] ) with @xmath122 , @xmath123 , and @xmath124 . comparing our result for @xmath0 with that of fg93",
    ", we can infer that @xmath125 $ ] . in the no - smoothing limit ,",
    "corresponding to @xmath126 , we recover @xmath127 , as expected .",
    "of course , the unsmoothed bias parameters are defined only in the fictitious limit of continuous density fields . in practice",
    ", one might expect the efficiency of galaxy formation to depend on the matter density not only at the point of interest , but in the neighboring vicinity as well .",
    "models such as peak biasing and halo biasing ( mo & white 1996 ) in fact imply a biasing relation such as equation  ( [ dexpr ] ) , where the smoothed bias parameters do in fact tend towards constant values in the large - scale limit .",
    "such a scenario would thus be inconsistent with the definition of the unsmoothed bias parameters in equation  ( [ dexp ] ) , and would yield precisely the fg93 result for @xmath0 , rather than equation  ( [ s3 ] ) .",
    "fortunately , these two situations can be distinguished on the basis of the large - scale behavior of @xmath0 , as we will illustrate .",
    "unless otherwise stated , it is hereafter understood that bias shall refer to the relationship between the unsmoothed tracer - mass and dark - matter fields , as given by equation  ( [ dexp ] ) .",
    "naturally , equation  ( [ s3 ] ) is @xmath20-independent , as expected for a scale - free power spectrum .",
    "while the actual power spectrum for any tracer - mass distribution will not be simply a scale - free power law with @xmath116 , it may be wondered whether , in the unsmoothed biasing picture , the divergence seen in figure [ fig : varepsilon ] will affect the results for @xmath0 on scales where the slope of the true ( cdm ) power spectrum is positive .",
    "bernardeau ( 1994a ) shows that the scale - dependent cdm result , without bias , can be recovered by using an effective index , @xmath128 in place of @xmath8 in the scale - free result for @xmath0./d\\log k$ ] , evaluated at wavenumber @xmath129 ( where @xmath130 is constant of proportionality chosen as to yield the best - fitting results ) , yields fractional errors in @xmath0 of at least 5% ( 20% ) for the smallest ( largest ) scales shown in figure [ fig : epscorrection ] . ]",
    "if we assume , for the sake of argument , that this holds true when calculating @xmath0 assuming our nonlinear biasing model , we can illustrate the impact of the @xmath118 term as a function of smoothing scale for various cdm models .",
    "the upper panel of figure [ fig : epscorrection ] shows @xmath131 for for three flat ( @xmath132 ) cosmological models : standard cold dark matter ( scdm ; @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 ) , a tilted cdm model ( tcdm ; @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath136 ) , and cdm with a cosmological constant ( @xmath24cdm ; @xmath137 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 ) , while the lower panel shows @xmath138 $ ] for these models .",

    "for an inferior data set , this degeneracy between the cosmological parameters , and in particular @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and their time dependence , can not be broken with the skewness , measured on scales @xmath40 @xmath3 mpc , as it provides only one constraint on the combination of these quantities .",

    "comparing the left and right panels further illustrates the dependence on the redshift of galaxy formation , @xmath168 , which , in principle , can also be constrained .    in theory ,",
    "a survey large and deep enough to resolve this degeneracy between constant and evolving bias might also enable a model - dependent determination of @xmath28 and @xmath29 solely from measurements of @xmath0 , as described in  2.1 .",
    "since distinctions between evolving and non - evolving bias , such as those drawn in figure [ fig : zetabiasdegofz ] , could also be made by considering the redshift dependence of @xmath0 , we can infer that such a survey might address the various degeneracies between @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and their evolution , solely from measurements of the skewness , without the need to consider the configuration dependence of the full 3pcf .",
    "unfortunately , it is unlikely that upcoming redshift surveys will be both deep and large enough to resolve the degeneracy of @xmath1 with respect to constant vs. evolving bias , and in any case would still be susceptible to redshift distortions which mix the density and velocity fields .",
    "however , bkj show that the angular 3pcf , which can be well - sampled over a large range of redshifts ( e.g. , by radio surveys ) and is free of such distortions , might be better able to discriminate between evolving and non - evolving bias scenarios .",
    "based on these results , it is clear that the often - stated result that @xmath4 is a constant of order unity ( groth & peebles 1977 ; jing & zhang 1989 ; tth , hollsi , & szalay 1989 ; gott , gao , & park 1991 ; jing , mo , & brner 1991 ; baumgart & fry 1991 ; bouchet 1993 ) is only a crude approximation resulting from a coarse averaging over allowed configurations and systematic errors arising from the normalization convention .",
    "valuable information is lost if the geometric dependence of @xmath4 , or more appropriately @xmath6 , is ignored .",
    "we also stress that figures [ fig : zeta_actual][fig : zetabiasdegofz ] , are only illustrations ; the statistical leverage gained by considering the full configuration - space variation of the 3pcf as a function of redshift should in principle discriminate between the signatures of gravitational evolution versus bias , independently measure the effective present - day values of @xmath28 and @xmath29 , the shape of the power spectrum , and possibly measure the evolution in these quantities and constrain the epoch of galaxy formation .",
    "we have derived leading - order results for the normalized spatial skewness and 3pcf , assuming gaussian ics , for an arbitrary tracer - mass distribution in flat and open universes , taking into account such features as the scale dependence and linear evolution of the cdm power spectrum and the presence of a possibly evolving ( decaying ) , linear or nonlinear bias , as defined for unsmoothed density fields .",
    "the predicted normalized amplitudes , @xmath0 and @xmath4 , for an unbiased tracer mass are in agreement with previous work ( bouchet 1992 ; juszkiewicz , bouchet , & colombi 1993 ; fg93 ; bernardeau 1994a ; fry 1994 ; jb97 ) .",
    "we extend the fg93 result for @xmath0 in the case of a nonlinear bias , defined for unsmoothed fields , to include a scale - dependent , leading - order correction which becomes appreciable for positive effective spectral indices , corresponding to scales @xmath37 @xmath3 mpc for cdm models .",
    "this correction term implies that the value of the nonlinear bias parameter , as defined for smoothed density fields , could generally depend on the adopted smoothing scale . in the unlikely event that @xmath0",
    "could be measured over scales @xmath37 @xmath3 mpc , the presence or absence of this behavior could shed light on the smoothed vs. unsmoothed biasing picture , and perhaps allow more accurate determinations of the linear- and nonlinear - bias parameters on the basis of skewness measurements alone .",
    "we show that the conventional definition of @xmath4 gives rise to rapid , non - monotonic variation and divergences which do not arise from the behavior of the 3pcf .",
    "we speculate that the large discrepancy between this behavior and that predicted by some @xmath5-body simulations is due to a practical bias , arising from the poor normalization convention , in the reconstruction of @xmath4 from data , rather than from the absence of nonlinear corrections in the ql pt prediction .",
    "we propose that this question may be addressed by considering @xmath5-body results at earlier cosmic epochs .",
    "we consider instead @xmath6 , which is everywhere well - behaved .",
    "we find the bias model to be a crucial factor influencing the clustering predictions , in agreement with matarrese ( 1997 ) . in particular , the scale dependence of @xmath0 and the configuration dependence of @xmath6 bear characteristic imprints of bias , such as a relative flattening and decrease with increasing @xmath28 and a relative increase with increasing @xmath29 .",
    "unlike @xmath0 , the predictions for @xmath6 are seen to depend significantly on the adopted cdm model , through the dependence on @xmath141 , and for all models investigated , the dependence of the 3pcf on triangle geometry implies stronger clustering of smaller , elongated structures .",
    "the statistic @xmath0 , while preserving information about the overall scale dependence , is seen to provide only one test on the combination of the cosmological parameters , @xmath238 , and @xmath239 , yielding degeneracies between these quantities , particularly for smoothing scales @xmath40 @xmath3 mpc .",
    "these are partially alleviated by considering the dependence of the full 3pcf on the triangle geometry .",
    "in particular , the variation of @xmath6 can be used to distinguish between the effects of gravitational evolution and bias , place constraints on the value of @xmath141 , and measure the effective constant bias terms @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "evolving - bias models , however , are found to yield similar predictions for both @xmath6 and @xmath0 as models with an appropriately smaller , constant bias , and thus can not be reliably distinguished using spatial statistics at @xmath237 .",
    "measurements of the 3pcf as a function of redshift could , in principle , directly measure bias evolution , @xmath7 , and the redshift of galaxy formation , but these might be more readily measurable using angular statistics ( bkj ) .",
    "a comparison of these predictions for @xmath0 and @xmath6 with several data sets characterizing different tracer populations would allow multiple , complementary constraints on the above parameters .",
    "the often - quoted `` empirical '' result , that the normalized 3pcf is a constant of order unity , is in part a result of coarse - averaging over all triangular configurations , which destroys much of this valuable information .    in practice ,",
    "other factors arise when comparing these predictions with observations .",
    "for example , redshift distortions , which mix information about the density and velocity distributions , must be accounted for when measuring spatial clustering ( fry & gaztaaga 1994 ; jing & brner 1998 ; verde 1998 ; heavens , matarrese , & verde 1998 ; scoccimarro , couchman , & frieman 1998 ) . finite - volume and boundary effects , as well as estimation biases , tend to reduce the observed clustering amplitude ( baugh , gaztaaga , & efstathiou 1995 ; szapudi & colombi 1996 ; colombi , szapudi , & szalay 1998 ; gaztaaga & bernardeau 1998 ; hui & gaztaaga 1998 ) , and poisson noise ( gaztaaga 1994 ) and sampling variance must also be taken into account .",
    "in addition , the calculations above can be extended in various ways .",
    "our assumed model for the bias is deterministic , but other stochastic models have been proposed which may yield different results , particularly on smaller scales ( fg93 ; catelan 1998 ; catelan , matarrese , & porciani 1998 ; taruya , koyama & soda 1998 ) .",
    "one might also investigate the effects of including higher - order nonlinear terms in the pt expansion , such as one - loop results ( jain & bertschinger 1994 ; scoccimarro & frieman 1996a , b ; scoccimarro 1998 ) ; these are expected to be negligible on ql scales , but become increasingly important when comparing predictions with observations on scales where @xmath240 .",
    "for example , @xmath5-body simulations indicate that @xmath4 becomes relatively shape - independent in the nonlinear regime , suggesting that a linear bias is not the only mechanism capable of producing a flattening ( scoccimarro 1998 ) , and gaztaaga & bernardeau ( 1998 ) also find that nonlinear effects tend to increase @xmath0 while erasing the shape dependence of @xmath4 .",
    "calculations analogous to those presented here can also be performed for higher - order moments and @xmath8-point cfs ( e.g. , kurtosis , four - point correlation function , etc . ) which , in principle , should provide additional constraints .",
    "finally , the entire discussion can be extended to include the predictions of structure - formation models with non - gaussian ics , such as topological - defect or isocurvature models ( e.g. , jaffe 1994 ) .",
    "we are grateful to roman scoccimarro for numerous discussions and useful suggestions .",
