    "the study of nearby ( kinematically - normal ) elliptical galaxies performed with the wf / pc camera aboard the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) has revealed the presence of central disks , dust clouds , and nuclear components on scale lengths of a few tens of parsecs ( e.g. , jaffe et al .",
    "1994 ; van den bosch et al . 1994 ; lauer et al .",
    "1995 , hereafter l95 ; van dokkum & franx 1995 ) . in all galaxies , the surface brightness profile @xmath10 for @xmath11 can be approximated as a power ",
    "law @xmath12 , with @xmath13 .",
    "galaxies with steep cusps are almost always small , fast ",
    "rotating objects , while in contrast massive , pressure  supported ones have shallow cusps , typically with @xmath14 ( e.g. , l95 ; kormendy et al .",
    "1995 , hereafter k95 ) .",
    "it is not clear whether this reflects a real dichotomy in the physical properties and formation processes , as suggested by l95 and k95 . in any case ,",
    "nuclear properties on scales of a few tens of parsecs are correlated with properties observed on global scales , and it is legitimate to ask whether this is the outcome of selection effects acting at formation , or whether it has resulted from subsequent galactic evolution .",
    "galaxies with kinematically - distinct cores are very interesting physical laboratories to test ideas of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "their distinct angular momenta suggest that these cores may be the relics of interactions or mergers , and thus may provide a powerful diagnostic to estimate the relevance of interactions in shaping galactic properties . kormendy ( 1984 )",
    "argued that the core of ngc 5813 is dominated by the remnant of a small galaxy that fell into a big elliptical .",
    "this scenario predicts core / global differences that should be detectable not only in the kinematics , but also in the stellar populations and overall structure .",
    "another possible scenario for kinematically - distinct cores implies gas - rich mergers of two galaxies , where the gas is converted into stars in the central regions , and subsequent star formation produces a disk which retains the orbital signature of the original gas .",
    "still another possibility is that formation of kinematically - distinct cores is a rather normal aspect of a hierarchical formation scenario for elliptical galaxies , where galaxies are built up from pre - existing clumps ( possibly different from current galaxies ) .",
    "the last two scenarios do not necessarily predict any measurable difference in the stellar population of the distinct core .",
    "forbes , franx & illingworth ( 1995 , hereafter f95 ) investigated hst wf / pc f555w images for eight early - type galaxies with kinematically - distinct cores .",
    "these authors found clear indications of small - scale dust in six out of the eight galaxies , and argued that the dust might be directly linked to the existence of nuclear radio activity in these galaxies .",
    "they also showed that the nuclear surface brightness profiles in this class of galaxies are similar to those in kinematically - normal galaxies . on this basis , they argued against the plausibility of the small galaxy accretion scenario , since this low - mass object should dominate the light in the core region and produce differences with respect to normal galaxies ( that are not observed ) .",
    "f95 searched for the nuclear disks expected in the dissipative core formation scenario ( and suggested by spectroscopic analysis of several distinct cores , see e.g. , franx & illingworth 1988 ) .",
    "the search lead to one detection in ngc 4365 ( previously reported by forbes 1994 ) , and to a couple of other candidates . in the other galaxies , no conclusions",
    "could be drawn due to the strong dust absorption .",
    "additional information is clearly needed to resolve the enigma of the formation of kinematically - distinct cores .",
    "multi - color , high - resolution imaging can provide a valuable key for understanding the origin of these peculiar stellar systems .",
    "in particular , within the limits imposed by their degeneracy between age and metallicity , _",
    "( i ) _ color gradients between the core region and the rest of the galaxy could be used to estimate metallicity / age differences in the stellar populations ; _ ( ii ) _ color information could help to detect nuclear disks , and indicate whether such disks were formed at the same time as the majority of stars ( or more recently , as a bluer color might indicate ) ; _ ( iii ) _ colors of the central cusps could provide insight into their formation , discriminating between accretion of low - mass stellar systems ( possibly leading to bluer cusps ) and stars formed in situ ( possibly leading to red cusps ) .",
    "observationally , colors and color gradients at subarcsecond scales are practically unexplored for any kind of galaxy .",
    "the only other example to date is that of crane et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , who measured gradients for 12 galaxies using pre - refurbishment foc data , and concluded that color variations are either very small or absent in galactic nuclei .",
    "however , these measurements are limited by low s / n and the uncertain pre - costar psf .    in this paper",
    "we extend the investigation started by f95 by studing wfpc2 images in two bands , namely f555w and f814w ( i.e. , similar to johnson @xmath0 and cousins @xmath1 , respectively ) , for 15 galaxies with kinematically - distinct cores .",
    "the new sample contains the eight galaxies of f95 , plus seven additional galaxies that also show peculiar core kinematics .",
    "eleven of the galaxies are luminous objects with absolute @xmath0 mag @xmath15 - 20 + 5 log @xmath16 ( @xmath17 km s@xmath18 mpc@xmath18 throughout this paper ) .",
    "the sample , the observations and the basic photometric analysis are described in section 2 .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 surface brightness profiles and the parameters defining the core morphology are presented in section 3 , together with the @xmath2 color profiles , the color maps , and the color gradients . in section 4",
    "we present the adopted parametrization of the surface brightness profiles , and derive the global estimator of the nuclear cusp - steepness which we will use in our discussion . in section 5",
    "we discuss the main results of this study , and summarize them in ( the concluding ) section 6 . in four appendices ,",
    "we describe _",
    "( i ) _ the procedure used to minimize the effects of nuclear patchy dust on the derivation of the surface brightness profiles , _ ( ii ) _ the comparison of our wfpc2 measurements with wf / pc profiles already published for some galaxies of our sample ; _ ( iii ) _ the deprojections of the surface density profiles , performed in order to obtain an estimate of the physical luminosity density and of its nuclear radial variation ; and _ ( iv ) _ the derivation of the nuclear properties of the l95 galaxies , performed so as to compare kinematically - peculiar with normal galaxies .",
    "the properties of the globular cluster systems in our sample are derived and discussed by forbes et al .",
    "the 15 galaxies constituting the sample are listed in table 1 , together with some global parameters .",
    "the galaxies cover a large range in optical , infrared , x - ray and radio luminosities , and in metallicities ( as characterized by central mg@xmath19 index values ) .",
    "seven of them ( ngc 1700 , 3608 , 4278 , 4589 , 5322 , 5982 and 7626 ) belong to the sample of schweizer et al . ( 1990 ) , and cover a large range in the `` fine - structure '' @xmath20 parameter ( from a value of 3.7 for ngc 1700 , to zero for ngc 3608 and ngc 4589 ) .",
    "the environment of the galaxies varies considerably , with some galaxies closely paired to a companion in a rather loose group ( e.g. , ic 1459 and ngc 7626 ) , and others embedded in rich clusters ( e.g. , the virgo galaxy ngc 4406 ) .      for each galaxy we acquired two f555w exposures of 500 seconds each , and two f814w exposures of 230 seconds each .",
    "the observations were taken with the wfpc2 camera centered on pc1 , with its scale of 0.046@xmath21 px@xmath18 , and a field of about @xmath22 .",
    "initial data reduction was performed using the standard stsci pipeline software . for each filter ,",
    "the two available images were compared to each other , and found to have the same central pixel value within poisson statistics .",
    "their relative alignment was checked before combining them , and found to be better than about 0.2 px .",
    "the two images were averaged and cosmic - ray cleaned using the cosmic ray rejection option of the stsdas task `` combine '' , in combination with a noise model appropriate for the pc1 ( all the images were taken with gain 15 , except those for ngc 1439 , 4406 , 4552 and 5322 , which were taken with gain 7 ) .",
    "hot and cold pixels were partly removed as well by the combining task ; an interpolation over the remaining defects was subsequently performed .",
    "the cosmic - ray and bad - pixel removal was checked by inspecting the residual difference between the cleaned image and each of the two original frames . except for ngc 1700",
    ", the observations were taken after 1994 april 24 .",
    "we did not correct for charge transfer efficiency ( cte ) , since this is relevant only for point sources in low background ( stiavelli 1996 ) , and also given the uncertainties associated with the available algorithm ( holtzman et al .",
    "1995 , hereafter h95 ) . in the case of ngc 1700 , we forced the isophotes to remain concentric over the whole radial range , and checked _ a posteriori _ for any bias in the measurements .",
    "sky subtraction was carried out for some of the galaxies , although the sky level was very small ( smaller than 1dn ) .",
    "the sky signal was determined from the wfc images , in areas furthermost from the nucleus .",
    "no sky was subtracted from ngc 4406 and ngc 4552 , since these galaxies obviously filled the field of view .",
    "the uncertainties introduced by not making this correction , or any contamination by the galaxy of the `` sky '' regions , were estimated to be negligible .",
    "this was verified by comparison with ground - based photometry in the overlap region .",
    "good agreement in the radial variation of the surface brightness was found between our outer surface brightness profiles and the ground - based photometry published by sparks et al .",

    "the photometric zero - point was derived and converted to the johnson - cousins system following the iterative procedure described in h95 .",

    "the subsequent term accounts for the pixel size .",
    "the constant shift of 0.1 mag was added following h95 in order to correct for infinite aperture .",

    "the final surface brightness profiles were corrected for galactic extinction ( see table 1 ) .",
    "k - corrections were also applied ( whitford 1971 ) , though they were always smaller than 0.03 mag .",
    "comparison with the ground - based photometry of goudfrooij et al .",
    "( 1994a ) and mller et al .",
    "( 1995 ) showed small zeropoint offsets in some cases .",
    "these were generally smaller than @xmath31 mag .",
    "there was no detectable systematic difference in the @xmath2 colors between our hst measurements and the ground - based results ( @xmath32 mag ) .",
    "we modeled each galaxy by means of an iterative procedure which fits isophotes to both @xmath0 and @xmath1 final images .",
    "the software package used was _ galphot _ ( jrgensen et al . 1992 ) .",
    "for all the galaxies , fits to derive the isophotal morphological parameters were performed on the @xmath0 and @xmath1 frames , after masking out stars and other point - like sources .",
    "most of the galaxies of our sample show extensive dust patches close to their centers . in order to minimize their effects on the determination of the surface brightness profiles in the heavily obscured nuclei",
    ", we adopted a modified version of the procedure described by f95 .",
    "these authors had only one filter ( @xmath0 ) available .",
    "they determined a maximum radius of influence for the dust ( i.e. , the `` dust radius '' ) and fixed the isophotal properties ( ellipticity and position angle ) to a constant value inside this radius .",
    "the values adopted were chosen equal to the one just beyond the dust radius .",
    "the patchy - dust areas were then masked out , and the surface brightness on each isophote ( of fixed ellipticity and position angle ) inside the dust radius was finally computed .",
    "the availability of two filters allowed us to improve on the above procedure .",
    "we used a simple `` screen - model '' to obtain a rough estimate of the dust absorption from the patchy variations of color over the image ( see appendix a ) .",
    "this model is very simplistic , and is not more than a first order approximation to the complex effects of dust .",
    "none the less , visual inspection of the resulting `` dust - improved '' @xmath33 images showed that the effects of patchy dust were indeed decreased .",
    "we used these images to obtain `` dust - improved '' values for the isophotal parameters , the ellipticity and the position angle .",
    "we tested whether these parameters were sensitive to details of the model , such as the location of the screen .",
    "we found no significant variations .",
    "the values of ellipticity and position angle obtained from the fits to the dust - improved @xmath33 frames were then kept fixed in a successive iteration of the ellipse fitting to the raw @xmath1 and @xmath0 images , in which the heavy dust patches had been previously masked out .",
    "the so - obtained surface brightness profiles , which we will refer to as to the _ final dust - improved profiles _ , were used in the remainder of our analysis .",
    "obviously , this procedure was not applied to those galaxies devoid of heavy dust patches in their nuclei . for these objects , the straight application of the isophotal fitting package to the raw @xmath1 and",
    "@xmath0 images ( masked for stars and other spurious sources ) already provided excellent fits , i.e. the final surface brightness profiles .",
    "more details on the procedure adopted for deriving the surface brightness profiles in the heavily obscured nuclei are given in appendix a.      the hst point - spread - function ( psf ) depends on position on the ccd . since no pointlike sources with adequate s / n located near to the nuclei were available for any of the objects , we computed the appropriate @xmath0 and @xmath1 psf for each galaxy by running tinytim ( krist 1992 ) .",
    "this is the optimal procedure in such cases , given the fact that archival stars can not be used due to the presence of focus drifts ( occurring on timescales of a few months ) , breathing ( occurring on timescales of a few minutes ) , and jitter ( varying from exposure to exposure ) .",
    "extensive use has been made of the tinytim psfs , and while some concerns may remain , they are second order effects , and the use of a first order correction is certainly better than none at all .    in order to derive the @xmath34 color maps and color profiles , the @xmath0 and @xmath1 final frames were matched to the same psf by convolving each band with the psf of the other band ( i.e. , @xmath35 , where the subscript @xmath36 stands for convolved images , and @xmath37 are the counts in the image frames ) .",
    "the relative centering of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 convolved images was checked before generating the maps ; in the case of ngc 1427 , we aligned the @xmath0 image to the @xmath1 image after rebinning to a quarter of the pixel size .",
    "the psf - matched color profiles were derived by subtraction of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 surface brightness profiles obtained by applying the same ellipse fitting procedure described in section 2.3 to the @xmath0 and @xmath1 psf - convolved images .",
    "separate measurements of @xmath38 and @xmath39 within apertures of @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 of radius were made in order to obtain the @xmath2 color within those apertures .",
    "the current data set does not allow us to derive accurate estimates for dust extinction .",
    "however , we used the method of goudfrooij et al .",
    "( 1994b ) to derive a first order estimate .",
    "we computed :    @xmath44    where @xmath45 or @xmath0 , and @xmath46 is the number of counts in the isophotal fit models of the psf - convolved frames .",
    "the mean extinctions @xmath47 and @xmath48 inside an aperture of @xmath43 were computed after masking the pixels with @xmath49 on the @xmath50 and @xmath51 frames .",
    "the corresponding values of color excess @xmath52 were derived .",
    "typical values are @xmath53 and @xmath54 , with internal errors smaller than @xmath55 0.008 and 0.005 magnitudes , respectively .",

    "they will be made available in computer format on request .",
    "a comparison with the wf / pc f555w profiles of f95 and l95 is presented in appendix b.    the third and fourth order sine and cosine terms indicate deviations of the isophotes from a pure ellipse as described in terms of a fourier expansion . in particular , a positive fourth order cosine term indicates a disky structure , while a negative value for this coefficient indicates boxy isophotes ( e.g. , lauer 1985 ) .",
    "the color profiles systematically show scatter ( @xmath56 mag , peak - to - peak ) of a few points in the radial range from about 5  to 9  .",

    "compared to the asymptotic values of @xmath129 , the values of @xmath147 have the big advantage of being independent of any particular parametrization of the surface brightness profile . on the other hand , they are more sensitive than @xmath129 to distance effects",

    "a good correlation is found between the @xmath147 and @xmath155 values , which suggests that distance effects are not significant in our sample .",
    "this is not altogether surprising since the majority of our galaxies typically lie within 10 - 20 @xmath156 mpc , and none lie beyond 40 @xmath156 mpc .",

    "we have summarized the nuclear properties of our sample in table 6 .",
    "the galaxies show a wide range in properties : most , but not all have dust , many , but not all show disks , and the intensity profiles fall in both catagories of `` shallow cusps '' , and `` steep cusps '' .",
    "there is no unique , qualifying feature in the present sample . for 11 galaxies",
    "the dust absorption is low enough that we can make a confident statement about the presence of the stellar disk at a scale comparable to the one of the kinematically - distinct nucleus ( typically about @xmath41 ) .",
    "we find that 7 out of the 11 galaxies show evidence for such a disk .",
    "some additional disks may have been missed because of projection effects ( rix & white 1990 ) .",
    "this suggests that such disks are very common in galaxies with kinematically - distinct cores .",
    "it is difficult to state whether this is a special properties of such galaxies , since there is no published data set on `` kinematically - normal '' galaxies based on wfpc2 data .",
    "this makes comparison of the relative disk - fractions in normal and kinematically - peculiar galaxies impossible at this time .",
    "however , it appears that not all galaxies have a disk on the scale of the distinct core .",
    "ngc 1700 , for example , is slightly boxy on the scale of the counter - rotating core .",
    "the nuclear intensity profiles of kinematically - distinct cores show a very large range of logarithmic slopes , from almost flat to very steep .",
    "the same was observed by f95 with their smaller sample of such objects .",
    "the presence of a break in the luminosity profiles is clearly not directly related to the presence of a distinct component . furthermore , dynamical arguments ( merritt & fridman 1995 ) might exclude the possibility that in some of these systems the observed decoupling is due to projection effects of a triaxial figure ( e.g. , statler 1991 ) .",
    "this , together with the fact that some of the kinematically - distinct cores do not show minor axis rotation ( which rules out the models of statler 1991 ) , provides evidence that the decoupling is often an intrinsic galactic property",
    ".    the comparison of the nuclear properties of kinematically - distinct cores with those of galaxies that are ( apparently ) kinematically - normal reveals a high degree of similarity between the two classes of objects . in figure 5 the values of @xmath161 are plotted against the absolute @xmath0 magnitude m@xmath162 for the galaxies of our sample ( filled squares ) and of l95 sample ( open triangles ) . in figure 6 the values of the break radius @xmath140 are plotted against m@xmath162 , the symbols having the same meaning as in figure 5 .",
    "the figures show that the average logarithmic nuclear slopes and break radii of kinematically - peculiar galaxies cover the same range of values spanned by galaxies with normal core kinematics [ although a hint is present for kinematically - distinct core galaxies having , when compared to normal galaxies , ( i ) intermediate values of @xmath163 , and ( ii ) smaller values of @xmath140 ] .",
    "the universal behaviour of nuclear slopes with luminosity was noted also by f95 in their smaller sample .",
    "l95 and k95 have pointed out that the global and nuclear properties are closely connected , with small galaxies hosting the steepest nuclei .",
    "this trend is confirmed in figures 7 and 8 , where the values of @xmath165 are plotted against the central mg@xmath19 values of davies et al .",
    "( 1987 ) and the anisotropy parameter @xmath166 ( expressed in logarithmic form , with @xmath167 the maximum rotation velocity and @xmath168 the central velocity dispersion of the galaxy ; from bender et al .",
    "the abscissas are now essentially distance - independent , and galaxies leave a clear pattern on these planes . galaxies with steep cusps tend to be fast rotators with a low @xmath169 absorption and large range of stellar densities , while those with shallow cusps tend to be supported by anisotropy in their velocity field , and to have strong @xmath169 absorption and low stellar densities ( see also figure 9 ) .",
    "galaxies with kinematical peculiarities in their cores again closely follow the locus of normal galaxies .",
    "it is a remarkable result that the nuclear morphology and structure of galaxies with kinematically - distinct cores are so similar to ( apparently ) kinematically - regular galaxies of the same luminosity class .",
    "this result is even more puzzling when one considers the wide dispersion in properties of the individual galaxies .",
    "consider , for example , the cases of ( i ) ngc 1700 , where the isophotes are very boxy close to the galaxy center , and switch to a disky shape in a sharp transition with increasing radius , ( ii ) ngc 4365 , where the inner disk smoothly dissolves into an outer boxy structure , and ( iii ) ngc 5982 , where the very round nucleus is embedded in a highly boxy galactic body .",
    "these large changes in the shapes of the isophotes suggest that distinct stellar components are present in the galactic potentials , but that the nature of these components can vary quite considerably .",
    "nonetheless , the overlap of the nuclear properties of the kinematically - peculiar galaxies with those of normal galaxies , and their continuity of properties , suggests that the kinematically - distinct cores may not owe their existence to any particularly exotic event or process .",
    "the growth and evolution of the nuclei appears to be closely related to the formation and evolution of the entire galactic bodies , with the cores possibly being a later development , or , alternatively , the kinematically - distinct cores are a statistically possible outcome of universal processes which formed the entire family of ellipticals , and their nuclei .      the radial color profiles of galaxies with kinematically - distinct cores provide a mean to trace variations in the stellar population related to the possible existence of subcomponents .",
    "ground - based photometric studies have not shown any anomalous color gradients for these galaxies ( see e.g. , franx et al . 1989 , peletier et al .",
    "however , these studies , as do all ground - based studies , suffer from a ( seeing- ) limited angular resolution .    in figure 10",
    "the @xmath2 color derived within an aperture of @xmath43 is plotted against the central mg@xmath19 value of davies et al .",
    "the spread in @xmath2 is large in our sample and might be attributable to the large amount of dust detected in the nuclei .",
    "some reduction was found when the color was corrected for the average patchy extinction measured within the same aperture on the @xmath50 and @xmath51 maps ( as described in  2.4 ) .",
    "the correlation [ @xmath170 between the extinction - corrected color and the mg@xmath19 line strength ( which is unaffected by dust ) is good , with a linear correlation coefficient of 0.88 .",
    "this suggests that the nuclear colors provide a reliable ( if not unique ) characterization of the properties of the stellar populations .    with the exclusion of ngc 4365 , the @xmath2 colors of the nuclear cusps are rather normal .",
    "by contrast , the central @xmath171pc region of ngc 4365 contains an elongated structure bluer by @xmath172 mag than the surroundings .",
    "this blue feature might be due to , e.g. , ( i ) a hole in an otherwise uniform distribution of dust ( a rather high dust mass has been inferred for this galaxy , but we do not observe any obvious patchy dust on the the pc image ) ; or ( ii ) a pure stellar population effect . assuming an underlying stellar population of 8 gyrs and [ fe / h]=0.25 dex , the difference in @xmath2 color between the nucleus and its adjacent region implies either an age difference of 3 - 4 gyrs , or a metallicity difference of 0.1 - 0.2 dex in [ fe / h ] ( see models by worthey 1994 ) .",
    "the total luminosity of this component is @xmath173 l@xmath5 , as derived from the total number of counts detected in the @xmath0 image within an aperture comparable to the size of the feature .",
    "observations of absorption line strengths at the proper spatial resolution are required to confirm the nature of the blue nucleus of ngc 4365 , i.e. , to confirm that differences in stellar populations between the very nucleus and the surrounding regions might exist in some kinematically - peculiar elliptical galaxies .",
    "we stress that we have not detected any particular features in the color profiles , which might be attributed to the kinematically - distinct cores .",
    "even in the seven galaxies in which photometric evidence for a stellar disk ( or ring ) has been found , namely ngc 1427 , ngc 1439 , ngc 1700 , ngc 4365 , ngc 4406 , ngc 4494 and ngc 5322 , there is no evidence for any difference between the color of the disk and that of the surrounding regions .",
    "the upper limit in the @xmath2 color difference is about 0.02 mag .",
    "this difference should be contrasted to the color gradients at larger radii , or the differences between galaxies , which span a range of 0.15 mag in our sample .",
    "it is therefore evident that the stellar populations in the nuclei are surprisingly homogeneous .",
    "alternatively , a very finely tuned conspiracy between age variations and metallicity variations much be present to produce very stable colors .",
    "high resolution spectroscopy with hst is needed to confirm this result .",
    "the spectroscopic indices will be much less sensitive to dust , and can determine whether a `` conspiracy '' of changes exist to keep the colors constant .",
    "the above results might be taken to rule out the scenario that the kinematically distinct cores formed from a merger of a small galaxy with a big galaxy ( kormendy 1984 ) . in the original scenario , the light at the nucleus was dominated by the small galaxy , and a `` core - within - a - core '' intensity profile was predicted .",
    "the nuclear color was predicted to be blue .",
    "none of these predictions have been confirmed , as noted by many authors ( e.g. , franx and illingworth 1988 ) .",
    "instead , these authors argued that the distinct components may have formed in - situ , for example in a star burst .",
    "schweizer ( 1989 ) argued that full - fledged mergers might produce such structures .",
    "one may therefore ask the question whether the dissipationless merger hypothesis has been finally disproven .    it may be too early to do so . for the galaxies with steep cusps ,",
    "the victim galaxy will be disrupted under most conditions , and no strong population gradient would be expected anyhow . for galaxies with shallow cusps",
    ", the presence of super massive black holes may substantial alter the fate of the small , infalling victim galaxy , as argued earlier by f95 .",
    "if the black hole has a mass comparable to the mass of the shallow cusp , then the tidal force will remain high throughout the whole shallow cusp .",
    "we have performed simple , semi - analytical calculations on the disruption of such a small victim galaxy .",
    "these calculations are similar to the ones presented by f95 , and show that the light of the victim galaxy is distributed in a very regular way over the host galaxy . if m32 is allowed to spiral into ic 1459 and be disrupted by a super massive black hole , then the light contribution would peak in the center at 10% , and decrease in a very regular way at larger radii . no strong color gradients would be produced in this way .    clearly , full simulations are needed to confirm the simple calculations and to establish what kinematic signatures remain .",
    "it is also clear , however , that it is too early to regard models of dissipational infall as impossible on the basis of the absence of color gradients . to date ,",
    "the strongest evidence against these models remains the fact that we see nuclear disks being formed in - situ in recent merger remnants .",
    "silva & wyse ( 1996 ) have suggested that a shallow nuclear cusp might be observed if diffuse dust were concentrated in the nucleus , even when the stars are actually distributed in a steep cusp .",
    "silva & wyse s models predict a very steep @xmath2 color gradient associated to the shallow cusp .    excluding residual effects of the _ patchy _ dust on the color profiles , strong @xmath2 gradients are not detected in our shallow - cusp galaxies ( see figure 11 , in which the inner @xmath2 gradients are plotted against the nuclear slopes @xmath163 ) .",
    "this is not what expected if dust were responsible for the nuclear morphology and color gradients .",
    "we conclude that diffuse dust is not the origin for the observed shallow cusps .",
    "global and nuclear properties of elliptical galaxies are closely related ( e.g. , l95 , k95 ) : _ ( i ) _ average- and low - luminosity ellipticals rotate rapidly , are nearly isotropic , approximately oblate - spheroidal , disky distorted , and ( in the k95 terminology ) `` coreless '' ( i.e. , have steep cusps ) , and _",
    "( ii ) _ giant ellipticals , essentially do not rotate , are anisotropic , moderately triaxial , boxy distorted , and have `` cuspy cores '' ( i.e. , have shallow cusps ) .",

    "however , if our sample is added to that of the normal l95 galaxies , the trends of the nuclear slope versus the global physical parameters are smooth and continuous , i.e. they do not show any sharp separation between small and large , high- or low- angular momentum galaxies .",
    "for example , _",
    "( i ) _ at intermediate luminosities ( figure 5 ) and metallicities ( figure 7 ) , some galaxies show steep stellar cusps , while others have shallow cusps ; _ ( ii ) _ although on average anisotropic ( pressure supported ) galaxies have @xmath174 and isotropic ( rotation supported ) galaxies have steeper nuclear cusps , some degree of overlap is present ( see e.g. figure 12 , where we plot the nuclear cusp slope versus the dynamical mass scale @xmath175 , and distinguish the isotropic from the anisotropic galaxies ) .",
    "this leaves room to scenarios in which the observed dichotomy in the nuclear slopes actually arises from a _ continuous variation _ of some parameter(s ) governing the galaxy formation and evolution processes .",
    "the observational results described so far suggest that one of such parameters might be the amount of dissipation that occurred in the course of galaxy formation .",
    "very likely , small , steep cusp galaxies have suffered from a large amount of dissipation during their formation .",
    "the shallow cusp galaxies might be instead the end products of much less dissipative formation processes ( e.g. , white 1980 ; stiavelli & matteucci 1991 ) .",
    "more data are needed to resolve this issue .",
    "in this paper we have presented an analysis of wfpc2 f555w and f814w images for fifteen galaxies with kinematically - distinct cores .",
    "the color data were used to correct for the effects dust .",
    "we have derived surface brightness and isophotal parameter profiles in the two bands , and color maps and radial profiles in @xmath2 .",
    "the surface brightness profiles were parametrized by using an average logarithmic slope inside 10 - 50 pc .",
    "this was then used to investigate the nuclear stellar properties of the galaxy cores .",
    "a similar parametrization was used for the nuclear stellar morphologies for the kinematically - normal galaxies of l95 , so as to compare the results obtained for our sample with a reference sample .",
    "we deprojected the surface brightness profiles , and investigated the relationship between projected quantities and physical stellar luminosity densities and cusp slopes .",
    "* there is no unique photometric parameter that distinguishes the galaxies with kinematically - distinct cores .",
    "they show a large range in properties on the scale of the kinematically - distinct cores , like their normal equivalents , namely shallow to steep cusps , and small - scale disks and boxiness .",
    "many of the galaxies show dust , often patchy and chaotic , and sometimes distributed in a ring or disk . * with some possible exceptions , no obvious evidence is found for homogeneous , diffuse dust _ confined _ to the galactic nuclei .",
    "thus , the nuclear colors are most likely representative of the stellar population properties . * in one galaxy , namely ngc 4365 , the innermost region ( 15pc in size , for which the total luminosity is @xmath4 l@xmath5 ) is bluer by about 0.05 mag than the surrounding regions .",
    "if this feature is interpreted as due to a variation in the stellar population , synthetic population models suggest an age younger by @xmath6 3 - 4 gyrs ( or an @xmath7 $ ] variation of about -0.2 dex ) between the feature itself and the adjacent galactic regions . *",
    "the radial logarithmic slopes of the nuclear stellar profiles are found to cover a large range of values , from almost flat to very steep ( the slopes @xmath129 range from @xmath6 0.1 to 0.8 ) .",
    "some galaxies show a clear `` break radius '' , whereas other do nt .",
    "the nuclear cusp slopes of kinematically - distinct core galaxies occupy the same region of parameter space as that occupied by kinematically - normal galaxies .",
    "independent of the core kinematical properties , slowly - rotating , anisotropic , high metallicity galaxies preferentially have shallow cusps , while fast - rotating , low - metallicity galaxies tend to have steep cusps . despite the bimodal distribution of the cusp slopes , the trends of the cusp slope with global galactic properties",
    "might be smooth and continuous , rather than appearing as a distinct dichotomy , as indicated by e.g. , k95 .",
    "* photometric evidence is found for faint stellar disks in seven galaxies , namely ngc 1427 , 1439 , 1700 , 4365 , 4406 , 4494 and 5322 . however , no difference in @xmath2 color ( @xmath176 mag ) between these disks and the surrounding galactic regions is present .",
    "these differences are much smaller than the gradients are larger radii , or the color differences between galaxies ( 0.15 mag ) .",
    "the nuclear populations are either very homogeneous , or finely - tuned conspiracies between age and metallicity variations exist .",
    "high resolution spectroscopy with hst is needed to test for the existence of variations in the metal absorption lines .",
    "these data have added new constraints on aspects of the formation process of elliptical and early - type galaxies . while dust has certainly complicated the interpretation of the data on very small scales , techniques that minimize its effect can be used and allow one to extract reliable quantitative information on structures , surface brightness and luminosity density distributions , as well as on the nature of the stellar population in the cores from colors .",
    "comparison of the nuclear with the global properties suggests that kinematically - distinct cores might be the normal outcome of regular hierarchical merging at early epochs , and not indicative of any unusual late event in the galaxies evolutionary history .",
    "hst spectroscopy will be extremely valuable to study the nuclear structure of the kinematically distinct components .",
    "it remains remarkable how these components stand out in the kinematics , and how difficult they are to find in imaging .",
    "hst spectroscopy may be able to resolve many of the unanswered questions of this paper .",

    "most of the extreme features such as rapid variations of ellipticity or of the position angle , and very high values for the third and fourth order terms of the fourier expansion of the intensity ( which indicate deviations of the isophotes from perfect ellipses ) , were absent or much reduced in amplitude .",
    "the final isophotal fits were performed , on the @xmath1 and @xmath0 images masked out of spurious point - sources and of dust , by keeping the center of the ellipses , the ellipticity and the position angle fixed to those derived from the fit to the @xmath196 image .",

    "the azimuthally averaged surface brightness profiles resulting from this procedure are termed _ final , dust - improved _ in our text .",
    "they are a much improved representation of the underlying galaxy starlight .",
    "typical errors on the light profiles , estimated from the residuals of the model fits , are @xmath200 mag .",
    "f95 and l95 presented f555w profiles for some of the galaxies of our sample .",
    "in particular , ic 1459 , ngc 1427 , 1439 , 4365 , 4494 , 4589 , 5982 and 7626 were investigated by f95 , while ngc 1700 , 3608 and 5813 are included in l95 . in figure 13",
    "we compare our f555w surface brightness , ellipticity , and position angle profiles within @xmath201 to those derived from those authors from the wf / pc data .",

    "l95 published a profile oriented differently , by about 90@xmath92 , and for the latter no isophotal parameters were reported by f95 due to the extensive dust .",
    "for the surface brightness profiles , the three galaxies of l95 are in very good agreement with our measurements ( once an average zero - point shift of about @xmath202 mag is removed ) . also the surface brightness profiles published by f95 for ic 1459 , ngc 4365 and",
    "ngc 5982 match our profiles quite well . for the remaining galaxies ( namely , ngc 1427 , ngc 1439 , ngc 4494 , ngc 4589 and ngc 7626 )",
    ", a systematic discrepancy is found in the innermost @xmath59 , where the f95 profiles are brighter than the wfpc2 ones ( by @xmath203 mag ) .",
    "possible causes for this effect are : _ ( i ) _ an imperfect correction for the wf / pc psf via the richardson - lucy method in galaxies with steep central cusps . in this respect , it is remarkable that l95 recovered the light profiles in the inner @xmath204 with a fourier algorithm , rather than via the standard deconvolution procedure ; _ ( ii ) _ the use of different dust masks in the obscured nuclei ; and _ ( iii ) _ the influence of the residual hst psf on the wfpc2 profiles .",
    "these factors are all potentially problematic , especially on strongly - cusped nuclei .",
    "the observed surface brightness profiles were deprojected by means of an abel inversion ( assuming spherical symmetry ) in order to derive the physical luminous density @xmath205 ( as a function of radius ) .",
    "there are problems associated with the simple - minded use of such an inversion . when used directly on the data this procedure amplifies the fluctuations and errors present in the data .",
    "in addition , since the inner profiles are influenced by the psf , the deprojection of the data is also affected by resolution effects .",
    "these effects are minimized by using the smooth galaxy models obtained by fitting equation ( [ physlaw ] ) to the observed profiles , since the psf was automatically taken into account in our fitting procedure ( with the potential risk here of systematic effects if the model does not match extremely well ) .",
    "thus , in order to obtain an estimate of the reliability of the derived values , we deprojected both the data and the smooth theoretical models .",
    "these two deprojected profiles were mostly in very good agreement .",
    "both deprojections were finally fitted with equation [ physlaw ] in order to have a parametric representation of the luminous density . for each galaxy ,",
    "the asymptotic ( @xmath131 ) slope @xmath206 of the fit to the deprojection of the model surface brightness was adopted as representative of the intrinsic slope of the nuclear cusp .",
    "a quality parameter was defined for the deprojections , ranging from zero ( least reliable ) , to 3 ( most reliable ) .",
    "this was obtained by averaging between the two approaches the number of times any of the following properties was satisfied : ( 1 ) absence of a central point - like source ; ( 2 ) steepness of the inner surface brightness profile ( @xmath150 ) smaller than 0.5 ; and ( 3 ) a difference smaller than 0.1 between _ ( a ) _ the asymptotic slope @xmath206 derived from the deprojection of the smooth theoretical surface brightness profile , and _ ( b ) _ the equivalent quantity computed from the original data .",
    "the quality parameter is listed in table 7 together with the @xmath0 luminous density at @xmath207 and 10 pc in @xmath208 , the deprojected logarithmic slopes in the range @xmath143 and @xmath152 pc ( @xmath209 and @xmath210 , respectively ) , and the asymptotic values of @xmath211 . in the table , all the given values are those derived from the deprojections of the model surface brightness , while the errors are the absolute difference between these estimates and those derived from direct of the data .    in figure 14 the average logarithmic slope of the @xmath0 surface brightness profiles @xmath165 is plotted against the corresponding asymptotic slope @xmath206 ( for ours and the l95 sample ; see appendix c ) . as expected",
    "( see e.g. , k95 ) , the points lie below the line @xmath212 ; however , the correlation is good .",
    "thus , the relationships of the galactic properties with @xmath165 can be directly translated into relationships with @xmath206 , although the former was adopted in our discussion because of its direct link to the observed data .",

    "for the three galaxies ngc 1700 , 3608 and 5813 , both the wf / pc data of l95 and our wfpc2 data were available .",
    "the values of @xmath215 derived for these galaxies from the two samples are in very good agreement .",
