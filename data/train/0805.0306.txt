    "the properties of gamma - ray burst ( grb ) host galaxies provide important insight into the nature of the burst progenitors . in the case of the long - duration grbs ( @xmath11 s ) , the hosts are blue star forming galaxies with high specific star formation rates and sub-@xmath1 luminosities ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the bursts themselves trace the star formation activity within their hosts @xcite . at low redshift ,",
    "@xmath12 , long grbs appear to occur preferentially in low luminosity and metallicity galaxies @xcite , although it remains unclear whether this is a causal connection or a byproduct of the intense star formation activity @xcite .",
    "taken together , these properties provided an early indication that the progenitors of long grbs are massive stars , and ultimately they may shed light on the conditions ( if any ) that favor the formation of the progenitors .",
    "the more recent discovery of afterglow emission from short - duration grbs led to associations with both star forming and elliptical host galaxies @xcite .",
    "the association with elliptical galaxies demonstrates unambiguously that the progenitors of at least some short grbs are related to an old stellar population , consistent with the popular model of compact object mergers ( ns - ns or ns - bh ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "imaging of the star forming host galaxy of grb050709 revealed that , unlike in the case of the long grbs , the burst was not associated with a region of active star formation @xcite .",

    "spectroscopic observations indicate that a substantial fraction of these galaxies are undergoing active star formation .",
    "indeed , of the current sample of short grbs localized to better than a few arcseconds ( 23 bursts ) , @xmath15 reside in star forming galaxies compared to only @xmath16 in elliptical galaxies .",
    "this result raises the question of whether some short grbs are related to star formation activity rather than an old stellar population , and if so , whether the star formation properties are similar to those in long grb host galaxies .",
    "the answer will shed light on the diversity of short grb progenitors , in particular their age distribution and the possibility of multiple progenitor populations .    here",
    "we present optical spectroscopy of short grb host galaxies and measure their luminosities , metallicities , and star formation rates (  [ sec : obs ] and  [ sec : prop ] ) .",
    "we then assess their specific star formation rates and luminosity - metallicity relation , and compare these results with the properties of long grb hosts and field star forming galaxies (  [ sec : disc ] ) .",

    "the metallicities as a function of host luminosity are shown in figure  [ fig : lz ] .",
    "to place the host galaxies of short grbs in a broader context we now turn to a comparison of their properties with those of long grb hosts and field star forming galaxies at a similar redshift range .",
    "for the field sample we use the @xmath72 emission line galaxies at @xmath73 from the great observatories origins deep survey - north ( goods - n ) field studied spectroscopically as part of the team keck redshift survey @xcite .",
    "we select this sample due to its large size , availability of luminosity , metallicity , and star formation rate measurements , and because its limiting magnitude for spectroscopy is similar to that for the short grb host galaxies .",
    "a comparison of the @xmath36-band absolute magnitude distributions of short and long grb hosts in the same redshift range ( @xmath74 ) is shown in figure  [ fig : mb ] .",
    "the long grb hosts range from @xmath75 to @xmath76 mag , with a median value of @xmath77 mag ( @xmath78 @xmath1 ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the long grb hosts extend to lower luminosities than the short grb hosts , with a median value that is about 1.1 mag fainter . a kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test indicates that the probability that the short and long grb hosts are drawn from the same underlying distribution is @xmath79 .",
    "on the other hand , a comparison to the goods - n sample reveals a similar distribution , and the k - s probability that the short grb hosts are drawn from the field sample is 0.6 .",
    "we reach a similar conclusion based on a comparison of specific star formation rates . for long grb hosts the inferred star formation rates range from about 0.2 to 50 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 , and their specific star formation rates are about @xmath80 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 @xmath56 , with a median value of about 10 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : ssfr ] , the specific star formation rates of short grb hosts are systematically lower than those of long grb hosts , with a median value that is nearly an order of magnitude lower .",
    "indeed , the k - s probability that the short and long grb hosts are drawn from the same underlying distribution is only @xmath81 .",
    "this is clearly seen from the cumulative distributions of specific star formation rates for each sample ( inset of figure  [ fig : ssfr ] ) .    on the other hand",
    ", a comparison to the specific star formation rates of the goods - n field galaxies reveals excellent agreement ( figure  [ fig : ssfr ] ) .",
    "the k - s probability that the short grb hosts are drawn from the field galaxy distribution is 0.6 .",
    "this result remains unchanged even if we use only the host galaxies in _",
    "sample 1_. thus , short grb hosts are drawn from the normal population of star forming galaxies at @xmath82 , in contrast to long grb hosts , which have elevated specific star formation rates , likely as a result of preferentially young starburst populations @xcite .    finally , the metallicities measured for short grb hosts are in excellent agreement with the luminosity - metallicity relation for field galaxies at @xmath10 ( figure  [ fig : lz ] ; @xcite ) .",
    "the two hosts with @xmath45 mag have @xmath66 , while those with @xmath47 to @xmath46 mag have @xmath83 , following the general trend . on the other hand ,",
    "the short grb host metallicities are systematically higher than those of long grb hosts , which have been argued to have lower than expected metallicities @xcite .",
    "the median metallicity of short grb hosts is about 0.6 dex higher than for long grb hosts , and there is essentially no overlap between the two host populations .",
    "we present optical spectroscopy of several short grb host galaxies , and a complete compilation of all short grbs with /xrt positions ( 23 bursts ) .",
    "about one half of the sample has spectroscopically identified host galaxies , with @xmath84 .",
    "the ratio of star forming to elliptical galaxies in this spectroscopic sample is @xmath31 , regardless of whether we use only the objects with sub - arcsecond positions , or include those with xrt positions .",
    "we note that the maximum allowed fraction of elliptical galaxies in the /xrt sample , assuming that all of the currently - unclassified hosts turn out to be ellipticals , is @xmath85 . in the formulation of @xcite , with a power law age distribution , @xmath86 ( where @xmath87 is the time delay between formation and merger ) , the range of early- to late - type ratios allowed by the data leads to @xmath88 ; if the ratio is indeed @xmath89 then @xmath90 .    despite the fact that most short grbs occur in star forming galaxies , their properties are strongly distinct from those of long grb hosts .",
    "the rest - frame @xmath36-band luminosity distribution of the short grb hosts is systematically brighter than for long grb hosts in the same redshift range .",
    "an even stronger difference is apparent in the specific star formation rates , with a median value for short grb hosts that is nearly an order of magnitude lower than for long grb hosts .",
    "similarly , the metallicities of the short grb hosts are about 0.6 dex higher than those of long grb hosts , and unlike the long grb hosts they follow the luminosity - metallicity relation of field galaxies . to the extent that the mean properties of the host galaxies reflect the identity of the progenitors",
    ", this clearly indicates that the progenitors of long and short grbs are themselves distinct , supporting additional lines of evidence such as the lack of supernova associations in short grbs .",
    "on the other hand , a comparison to a large sample of star forming field galaxies in a similar redshift range reveals excellent agreement in terms of specific star formation rates and the luminosity - metallicity relation .",
    "indeed , the k - s probability that the short grb hosts are drawn from the field galaxy population is high , @xmath91 .",
    "thus , short grbs select galaxies that are representative of the average stellar populations at least to @xmath40 .    these comparisons , along with the presence of some short grbs in elliptical galaxies , indicate that the progenitor ages span a wide range , @xmath92 gyr .",
    "however , the overall dissimilarity to the hosts of long grbs , which appear to be dominated by young stellar populations ( @xmath54 gyr ; @xcite ) , indicates that only a small fraction of short grbs ( @xmath93 ) are likely to arise from a prompt population of progenitors .",
    "these conclusions provide additional support and constraints on the binary coalescence model of short grbs , but are at odds with young progenitor populations such as magnetars .",
    "we finally note that while nearly half of the short grb hosts remain unclassified at present , the overall qualitative conclusion of our study  that short and long grb hosts and hence the progenitors have a different distribution of properties  is robust .",
    "in particular , even if future spectroscopic observations of the unclassified hosts reveal that they are more similar to those of long grbs , the overall dispersion in short grb host properties will still be significantly larger than for long grb hosts , both in terms of metallicities and specific star formation rates .",
    "naturally , any population of short grb hosts that is found to be similar to long grb hosts may lead to the conclusion that some of the progenitors are related to a young stellar population ( e.g. , promptly merging binaries or magnetars ) ; to reiterate , our current limit on such a population is @xmath93 .",
    "looking forward , we expect to advance our understanding of the progenitors from three primary lines of host galaxy investigations .",
    "first , with a growing sample of short grb hosts we will be able to assess whether the progenitor population is uniform , or perhaps exhibits a bimodal distribution , with a contribution from prompt ( proportional to star formation ) and delayed ( proportional to stellar mass ) components , as appears to be the case for type ia supernovae ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we expect the sample to grow both from new events , and from continued optical and near - ir spectroscopy of the existing hosts .",
    "second , high angular resolution imaging with the _ hubble space telescope _ can be used to investigate in detail the location of short grbs within their host galaxies .",
    "this has already been done for grb050709 , indicating that , unlike for long grbs , the burst was not associated with a region of active star formation @xcite .",
    "finally , absorption spectroscopy of short grb afterglows , still unavailable in the present sample , will directly reveal the type of environment ( disk , halo , intergalactic medium ) in which the bursts explode . taken together",
    ", these studies promise to shed light on the short grb progenitor population(s ) , at least until the advent of sensitive gravitational wave detectors in the next decade .    based in part on observations obtained at the gemini observatory , which is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy , inc .",
