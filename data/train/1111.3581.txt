    "coupled oscillator models are omnipresent in the scientific literature because the emergence of coherent behavior in large families of interacting units that have a periodic behavior , that we generically call _ oscillators _ , is an extremely common phenomenon ( crickets chirping , fireflies flashing , planets orbiting , neurons firing , ... ) .",
    "it is impossible to properly account for the literature and the various models proposed for this kind of phenomena , but while a precise description of each of the different instances in which synchronization emerges demands specific , possibly very complex , models , the _ kuramoto model _ has emerged as capturing some of the fundamental aspects of synchronization @xcite .",
    "it can be introduced via the system of @xmath0 stochastic differential equations @xmath2 for @xmath3 , where    1 .",
    "@xmath4 is a family of standard independent brownian motions : in physical terms , this is a _ thermal noise _ ; 2 .",
    "@xmath5 is a family of independent identically distributed random variables of law @xmath6 : they are are the _ natural frequencies _ of the oscillators and , in physical terms , they can be viewed as a _ quenched disorder _ ; 3 .",
    "@xmath7 and @xmath8 are non - negative parameters , but one should think of them as positive parameters since the cases in which they vanish have only a marginal role in the what follows .    the variables @xmath9 are meant to be angles ( describing the position of rotators on the circle @xmath10 ) , so we focus on @xmath11 and defines , once an initial condition is supplied , a diffusion process on @xmath12 . note that if @xmath13 solves , also @xmath14 , with @xmath15 , is a solution : this is the rotation symmetry of the system that will repeatedly make surface in the remainder of the paper .",
    "some of the main features are easily grasped : each oscillator rotates at its own speed , it is perturbed by independent noise and it interacts with all the other oscillators : the interaction tends to align the rotators .",
    "it may be helpful at this stage to point out that if @xmath16 , that is the natural frequencies are just zero , then the dynamics is reversible with invariant probability measure that , up to normalization , is @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the uniform measure on @xmath12 .",
    "the gibbs measure in is a well known statistical mechanics model  it is the classical xy spin mean field model or rotator mean field model  treated analytically in @xcite in the @xmath1 limit . in particular , the model exhibits a phase transition at @xmath19 , that is effectively a _ synchronization transition _ : in the @xmath1 limit we have that for @xmath20 the rotators become independent and uniformly distributed over @xmath10 , while for @xmath21 the limit measure is obtained by choosing a phase @xmath22 uniformly in @xmath10 and by choosing the values of the phase of each oscillator by drawing it at random following a suitable distribution that concentrates around @xmath22 .",
    "however , in ( * ? ? ?",
    "1.2 ) , it is shown that , unless @xmath23 , the model is not reversible ( for @xmath6 almost surely all the realization of @xmath24 ) and one effectively steps into the domain of non - equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "our approach actually relies on a sharp control of the reversible case and works when the system is not too far from reversibility , that is for weak disorder .",
    "our approach actually applies well beyond : here we will treat explicitly the case @xmath25 is replaced by @xmath26 , that is the natural frequency @xmath25 is replaced by a _",
    "natural dynamics _ that can be substantially different from one oscillator to another .",
    "this model is a disordered version of the active rotator model considered for example in @xcite .",
    "since we will focus on @xmath27 , from now on , for ease of exposition , we set @xmath28 .      an efficient way to tackle is to consider the empirical probability on @xmath29 @xmath30 in fact , in the @xmath31 limit , the sequence of measures @xmath32 converges to a limit measure whose density ( with respect to @xmath33 ) solves the nonlinear fokker - planck equation @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 denotes the convolution and @xmath37 is a notation for the integration with respect to @xmath6 , so @xmath38 is the convolution of @xmath39 and @xmath40 , averaged with respect to the disorder .",
    "here and throughout the whole paper @xmath41 means @xmath42 .",
    "the fokker - planck pde appears repeatedly in the physics and biology literature , see e.g. @xcite , and a mathematical proof ( and precise statement ) of the result we just stated can be found in @xcite .",
    "notably , in @xcite the result is established under the assumption that @xmath43 and emphasis is put on the fact that the result holds for almost every realization of the disorder sequence @xmath44 .",
    "let us point out that in @xmath24 is a one dimensional real variable , while in the superscript @xmath24 is a short for the whole sequence of natural frequencies .",
    "since what follows is really about this abuse of notation will be of limited impact .    in appendix",

    "we want to stress that can be viewed as a family of coupled pdes , one for each value of @xmath24 in the support of @xmath6 : @xmath45 is the distribution of phases in the population of oscillators with natural frequency @xmath24 .",
    "remarkably ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) , if @xmath6 is symmetric all the stationary solutions to can be written in a semi - explicit way as @xmath46 ( @xmath47 is an arbitrary constant that reflects the rotation symmetry ) where @xmath48 with @xmath49,\\ ] ] and @xmath50 , @xmath51 is the normalization constant and @xmath52 $ ] satisfies the fixed - point relation @xmath53 a series of remarks are in order :    1 .",

    "such solutions correspond to a synchronization phenomenum , since the distribution of the phases is no longer trivial .",
    "as explained in figure  [ fig : fixed point psi ] and its caption , in general there can be more than one fixed point @xmath61 : in absence of disorder there is only one positive fixed point ( when it exists , that is for @xmath63 ) , but this fact is non - trivial even in this case ( see below ) .",
    "uniqueness is expected for @xmath6 which is unimodal , but this has not been established .",
    "4 .   while the local stability of @xmath64 is understood @xcite and it holds only if @xmath65 , the stability properties of the non - trivial solutions are a more delicate issue .      here",
    "are two natural questions :    * what are the stability properties of the non - trivial stationary solutions ? *",
    "what happens if @xmath6 is not symmetric ?",
    "our work addresses these two questions and provides complete answers for weak disorder . the precise set - up of our work",
    "is better understood if we remark from now that we can assume @xmath66 .",
    "in fact , if this is not the case we can map the model to a model with @xmath67 by putting ourselves on the frame that rotates with speed @xmath68 , that is if we consider the diffusion @xmath69 .",
    "so , we assume henceforth @xmath67 and we rewrite the natural frequencies as @xmath70 , with @xmath71 a non - negative parameter .",
    "we assume moreover that @xmath72\\ , .\\ ] ] in this set - up , becomes @xmath73 note that this leads to ( obvious ) changes to - .",
    "we have introduced this parameterization because the results that we present are for small values of @xmath71 . in particular",
    "we are going to show that for any @xmath63 , there exists @xmath74 such that for @xmath75 $ ]    * there exists a solution @xmath76 to of the form @xmath77 , we show that @xmath78 and we actually give an expression for @xmath79 : this is a rotating wave ( or limit - cycle ) for the dynamical system and we establish its stability under perturbations ; * when @xmath6 is symmetric and @xmath80 we show that there is , up to rotation symmetry , only one non - trivial solution and that it is ( linearly and non - linearly ) stable .",
    "the results we obtain are based on the rather good understanding that we have of the case @xmath81 that , as we have already explained , is reversible and the corresponding fokker - planck pde is of gradient flow type ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these properties have been exploited in @xcite in order to extract a number of properties of the fokker - planck pde ( denoted from now on : reversible pde ) @xmath82 and notably the linear stability of the non - trivial stationary solutions .",
    "in fact one can find in @xcite an analysis of the evolution operator linearized around the non - trivial stationary solutions .",
    "some of the results in @xcite are recalled in the next section , but they are not directly applicable because the @xmath81 case that corresponds to what interests us is rather @xmath83 which we call _ non - disordered pde_. so the _ natural frequencies _ have no effective role beyond separating the various rotators into populations with given natural ( ineffective ) frequency that now are just labels . but in order to set - up a proper perturbation procedure we need to control and , in particular , we need ( and establish ) a spectral gap inequality for the evolution linearized around the non - trivial solutions .",
    "this spectral analysis is going to be central both for the general and for the symmetric disorder case . in the general",
    "set - up we are going to exploit the _ normally hyperbolic structure _",

    "@xcite that in absence of noise and interaction ( @xmath91 ) rotate ( this happens if @xmath92 and of course the direction of rotation depends on the sign of @xmath93 ) and others that instead are stuck at a fixed point ( this happens if @xmath94 ) .",
    "our approach allows us to establish that there is a synchronization regime for @xmath63 and @xmath71 small and to describe the dynamics of the system in this regime .",
    "this is going to be detailed in section  [ sec : ar ] .",
    "the two questions raised at the beginning of this section have been already repeatedly approached but looking at synchronized solutions as bifurcation from incoherence .",
    "the results are hence for @xmath7 close to the critical value corresponding to the breakdown of linear stability of @xmath95 : one can find a detailed review of the vast literature on this issue in ( * ? ? ?",
    "our results are instead for arbitrary @xmath63 , but @xmath71 smaller than @xmath96 and of course @xmath96 vanishes as @xmath7 approaches @xmath97 .",
    "we first recall some results about the reversible pde .",
    "the stationary solutions @xmath98 are , up to rotation invariance , given by - , but formulas get simpler , namely @xmath99 where @xmath100 and this time we have the more explicit expression @xmath101 is the normalization constant and @xmath102 is a solution of the fixed - point problem @xmath103 where we used standard notations for the modified bessel functions @xmath104 the mapping @xmath105 is increasing , concave ( see @xcite ) and with derivative at @xmath106 equal to @xmath107 . consequently if @xmath108 , @xmath109 is the unique solution of the fixed - point problem , and @xmath110 is the only stationary solution of . if @xmath63 , we get in addition a circle ( because of the rotation invariance ) of nontrivial stationary solutions @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the unique non trivial fixed - point .",
    "let us now focus on the non - disordered pde and let us insist on the fact that we are interested in solutions such that @xmath113 is a probability density .",
    "observe then that if @xmath114 is a stationary solution of , we see ( appendix [ sec : appendix regularity pt with disorder ] ) that @xmath115 is @xmath116 with respect to @xmath117 and that @xmath118 is a stationary solution for .",
