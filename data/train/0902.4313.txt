    "the theoretical description of semileptonic decays involves the matrix elements of vector and axial - vector currents ( @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) between @xmath0 mesons and excited @xmath1 mesons . for the processes @xmath61 and @xmath62",

    "above , we have presented the decay rates of b semileptonic decay processes @xmath81 and @xmath82 in terms of the universal form factors @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively .",
    "the only unknown factors in these equations are @xmath69 and @xmath70 , which need to be determined by nonperturbative methods .",
    "in the calculation of isgur - wise functions in hqet by means of qcd sum rule , the interpolating currents are potentially important . in ref .",
    "@xcite , two series of interpolating currents with nice propertties were proposed : @xmath83 or @xmath84 where @xmath85 corresponding to two series of doublets of the spin - parity @xmath86 $ ] and @xmath87 $ ] , respectively .",
    "@xmath88 is the transverse component of the covariant derivative with respect to the velocity of the meson and @xmath89 with the transverse metric @xmath90 .",

    "however , currents with derivatives of one order higher ( [ current2 ] ) are also used in some conditions because in the nonrelativistic quark model there is a corresponding relation between the orbital angular momenta and the orders of derivatives in the space wave functions . as for the orbital d - wave mesons , which corresponding to derivatives of order two , it is reasonable to use the currents ( [ current5 ] ) , ( [ current6 ] ) , ( [ current7 ] ) and ( [ current8 ] ) .",
    "these currents have nice properties , they have nonvanishing projection only to the corresponding states of the hqet in the @xmath114 limit , without mixing with states of the same quantum number but different @xmath19 .",
    "thus we can define one - particle - current couplings as follows : @xmath115 @xmath116 @xmath117 @xmath118 the couplings @xmath119 are low - energy parameters which are determined by the dynamics of the light degree of freedom .",
    "since the pairs ( @xmath120 , @xmath121 ) and ( @xmath122 , @xmath123 ) are related by the spin symmetry , we will consider @xmath120 and @xmath122 hereafter .",
    "the decay constants @xmath119 can be estimated from two - point sum rules , therefore we list the sum rules after the borel transformation .",

    "it is @xcite @xmath124 for the @xmath125 doublet , when the currents ( [ current7 ] ) and ( [ current8 ] ) are used , the corresponding sum rule is : @xmath126 for the @xmath127 doublet , when the currents ( [ current5 ] ) and ( [ current6 ] ) are used , the corresponding sum rule is : @xmath128    as we have just mentioned , for the amplitudes of the semileptonic decays into excited states in the infinite mass limit , the only unknown quantities in ( [ rate1 ] ) , ( [ rate2 ] ) , ( [ rate3 ] ) and ( [ rate4 ] ) are the universal functions @xmath69 and @xmath70 . in ref .",

    "considering that the corresponding relation between the orbital angular momentum and the order of the derivative mentioned above , we use the currents ( [ current7 ] ) and ( [ current8 ] ) instead of ( [ current3 ] ) and ( [ current4 ] ) for the ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) doublet . as for the ( @xmath7 , @xmath35 ) doublet",
    ", we also use the currents ( [ current5 ] ) and ( [ current6 ] ) .    in order to calculate this two form factors by qcd sum rules",
    ", we study the analytic properties of three - point correlators : @xmath129 @xmath130 where @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",

    "they are typically of order @xmath137 and remain finite in the heavy quark limit .",
    "@xmath138 and @xmath139 are analytic functions in the  off - shell \" energies @xmath140 and @xmath141 with discontinuities for positive values of these variables .",
    "they also depend on the velocity transfer @xmath142 , which is fixed in a physical region .",
    "@xmath143 are lorentz structures .",
    "following the standard qcd sum rule procedure , the calculations of @xmath138 and @xmath139 are straightforward .",
    "first , we saturate eqs.([rule1 ] ) and ( [ rule2 ] ) with physical intermediate states in hqet and find that the hadronic representations of the correlators as follows : @xmath144 where @xmath145 are the decay constants defined in eqs.([const1 ] ) and ( [ const3 ] ) , @xmath146 .",
    "second , the functions can be approximated by a perturbative calculation supplemented by nonperturbative power corrections proportional to the vacuum condensates which are treated as phenomenological parameters .",
    "the perturbative contribution can be represented by a double dispersion integral in @xmath147 and @xmath148 plus possible subtraction terms .",
    "so the theoretical expression for the correlator has the form @xmath149 the perturbative part of the spectral density can be calculated straightforward .",
    "confining us to the leading order of perturbation , the perturbative spectral densities of the two sum rules for @xmath69 and @xmath70 are @xmath150 \\nonumber\\\\&\\times\\theta(\\nu)\\theta(\\nu^{'})\\theta(2y\\nu\\nu^{'}-\\nu^{2}-\\nu^{'2}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath151 \\nonumber\\\\&\\times\\theta(\\nu)\\theta(\\nu^{'})\\theta(2y\\nu\\nu^{'}-\\nu^{2}-\\nu^{'2}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] following the arguments in refs .",
    "@xcite , the perturbative and the hadronic spectral densities can not be locally dual to each other , the necessary way to restore duality is to integrate the spectral densities over the  off - diagonal \" variable @xmath152 , keeping the  diagonal \" variable @xmath153 fixed .",
    "it is in @xmath154 that the quark - hadron duality is assumed for the integrated spectral densities .",
    "the integration region can be expressed in terms of the variables @xmath155 and @xmath154 and we choose the triangular region defined by the bounds : @xmath156 , @xmath157 . as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , the upper limit @xmath158 for @xmath154 in the region @xmath159\\omega_{c0}\\leqslant\\omega_{c}\\leqslant\\frac{1}{2}(\\omega_{c0}+\\omega_{c2})$ ] is reasonable .",
    "a double borel transformation in @xmath160 and @xmath161 is performed on both sides of the sum rules , in which for simplicity we take the borel parameters equal @xcite : @xmath162 . in the calculation , we have considered the operators of dimension @xmath163 in ope . after adding the nonperturbative parts",
    ", we obtain the sum rules for @xmath164 and @xmath165 as follows : @xmath166 @xmath167 we also derive the sum rule for @xmath165 by using the currents ( [ current9 ] ) and ( [ current10 ] ) , which appears to be @xmath168",
    "we now evaluate the sum rules numerically .",
    "for the qcd parameters entering the theoretical expressions , we take the standard values : @xmath169 , @xmath170 , and @xmath171 . in the numerical calculations ,",
    "we take @xmath172 @xcite for the mass of the @xmath36 doublet and @xmath173 for the @xmath29 doublet . for mass of initial @xmath0 meson ,",
    "we use @xmath174 @xcite .    in order to obtain information of @xmath69 and @xmath70 with less systematic uncertainties in the calculation",
    ", we divide the three - point sum rules by the square roots of relevant two - point sum rules , as many authors did @xcite , to reduce the number of input parameters and improve stabilities .",
    "then we obtain expressions for the @xmath69 and @xmath70 as functions of the borel parameter @xmath175 and the continuum thresholds . imposing usual criteria for the upper and lower bounds of the borel parameter",
    ", we found they have a common sum rule  window \" : @xmath176 , which overlaps with those of two - point sum rules ( [ consrule1 ] ) , ( [ consrule2 ] ) and ( [ consrule3 ] ) ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . notice that the borel parameter in the sum rules for three - point correlators is twice the borel parameter in the sum rules for the two - point correlators . in the evaluation we have taken @xmath177 @xcite , @xmath178 , and @xmath179 .",
    "the regions of these continuum thresholds are fixed by analyzing the corresponding two - point sum rules . according to the discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we can fix @xmath180 and @xmath158 in the regions @xmath181 and @xmath182 .",
    "the results are showed in fig .",
    "because of the large background from @xmath183 decays , there is no experimental data available so far . as we can see from table [ tabe2 ] , the rates of semileptonic @xmath0 decay into the @xmath184 doublet are tiny and our results are larger than those predicted by ref .",
    "@xcite in the @xmath0 to @xmath185 charmed doublet channels .",
    "the difference comes because the way in which we choose the parameters is different from theirs .",
    "they chose the parameters according to other theoretical approaches .",
    "in contrast , we choose the parameters following the way of ref . @xcite .",
    "in addition , we also estimate the universal form factor @xmath70 with the sum rule ( [ rule5 ] ) and we get almost the same result as ( [ linear2 ] ) . when trying to estimate the @xmath69 by using the currents ( [ current3 ] ) and ( [ current4 ] ) , we find that after the quark - hadron duality are assumed the integral over the perturbative spectral density becomes zero . as for the @xmath18-wave and the @xmath186-wave mesons ,",
    "similar results can be obtained after the calculations above have been carefully repeated .",
    "the semileptonic and leptonic @xmath0 decay rate is about @xmath187 of the total @xmath0 decay rate , in which the @xmath24-wave charmed mesons @xmath1 and @xmath23 contribute about @xmath188 @xcite and the @xmath18-wave charmed mesons contribute about @xmath189 @xcite .",
    "our results then suggest that the @xmath1-wave charmed mesons contribute about @xmath190 of the total @xmath0 decay rate .",
    "sum up the branching ratios of these semileptonic @xmath0 decay processes , the eight lightest charmed mesons contribute about @xmath191 of the @xmath0 decay rate .",
    "therefore , semileptonic decays into higher excited states and nonresonant multibody channels should be about @xmath192 of the @xmath0 decay rate .",
    "whatsoever , our result is just a leading - order estimate of the contribution of the @xmath1-wave charmed mesons channels to the semileptonic @xmath0 decay .    in summary , we estimate the leading - order universal form factors describing the @xmath0 meson of ground - state transition into orbital excited @xmath1-wave charmed resonances , the ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) states ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) , which belong to the @xmath125 heavy quark doublet and the ( @xmath3 , @xmath6 ) states ( @xmath7 , @xmath35 ) , which belong to the @xmath127 heavy quark doublet , by use of qcd sum rules within the framework of hqet .",
    "the semileptonic decay widths as well as the branching ratios we get are shown in table [ tabe2 ] .",
    "the predictions are larger than those predicted by ref .",
    "this needs future experiments for clarification .",
    "we also prove that when @xmath185 the interpolating currents ( [ current1 ] ) and ( [ current2 ] ) proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite are really equivalent .",
    "it is worth noting that in the estimate of the semileptonic @xmath0 decay form factors when the currents ( [ current1 ] ) with quantum numbers of light degree of freedom @xmath193 are used for the excited charmed mesons , we find the perturbative contributions vanish after the quark - hadron duality are assumed . in this case",
    "we should use the currents ( [ current2 ] ) which contain derivatives of one order higher .",
