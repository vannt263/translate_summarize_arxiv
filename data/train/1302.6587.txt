    "good physical theories are expected to provide _ natural _ explanations of experimental data and observations . although physicists disagree about the definition of `` natural , '' the idea that the criterion of naturalness exists and is a useful pointer to deeper levels of understanding has a long and storied history . in 1693 , for example , when asked by clergyman robert bentley to explain how the law of universal gravitation was consistent with a static universe , isaac newton wrote  @xcite :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ that there should be a central particle , so accurately placed in the middle , as to be always equally attracted on all sides , and thereby continue without motion , seems to me a supposition fully as hard as to make the sharpest needle stand upright on its point upon a looking - glass . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    newton went on to conclude that this unnatural state of affairs could be taken as evidence for an infinite universe with initial conditions set by a divine power .",
    "three hundred years later , the assumption of a static universe appears quaint , but we are no closer to a natural explanation of our accelerating universe than newton was to his static one .",
    "more generally , the image of a needle balanced upright on a mirror remains the classic illustration of a possible , but unnatural , scenario that cries out for a more satisfactory explanation , and the notion of naturalness continues to play an important role in many areas of physics .    in particle physics",
    "today , the role of naturalness is nowhere more central than in the statement of the gauge hierarchy problem , the question of why the weak scale @xmath1 is so far below the ( reduced ) planck scale @xmath2 . for many years",
    ", this has been the dominant problem motivating proposals for new particles and interactions .",
    "chief among these is supersymmetry , which solves the gauge hierarchy problem if there are supersymmetric partners of the known particles with masses not far above the weak scale .",
    "this has motivated searches for superpartners at colliders , in low - energy experiments , and through astrophysical observations .",
    "so far , however , no compelling evidence for weak - scale supersymmetry has been found , and recent null results from searches at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) have disappointed those who find supersymmetry too beautiful to be wrong and led its critics to declare supersymmetry dead .    in this article , we review the status of weak - scale supersymmetry at this brief moment in time when a higgs - like particle has been discovered at the 8 tev lhc , and the lhc has entered a two - year shutdown period before turning on again at its full center - of - mass energy . the field of supersymmetry phenomenology is vast , and we will necessarily review only a small subset of its many interesting aspects . as we will see , however , weak - scale supersymmetry is neither ravishingly beautiful ( and hasnt been for decades ) , not is it excluded by any means ; the truth lies somewhere in between .",

    "supersymmetry  @xcite has beautiful mathematical features that are independent of the scale of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "in addition , however , there are three phenomenological considerations that have traditionally been taken as motivations for weak - scale supersymmetry : the gauge hierarchy problem , grand unification , and wimp dark matter . in this section ,",
    "we review these and their implications for superpartner masses .",
    "the gauge hierarchy problem of the standard model  @xcite and its possible resolution through weak - scale supersymmetry  @xcite are well - known .",
    "( for reviews , see , _ e.g. _ , refs .",
    "the standard model includes a fundamental , weakly - coupled , spin-0 particle , the higgs boson .",
    "its bare mass receives large quantum corrections . for example , given a dirac fermion @xmath5 that receives its mass from the higgs boson , the higgs mass is @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the physical higgs boson mass  @xcite , @xmath8 is the bare higgs mass , and the remaining term is @xmath9 , the 1-loop correction . the parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the yukawa coupling and number of colors of fermion @xmath5 , @xmath12 is the largest energy scale for which the standard model is valid , and subleading terms have been neglected . for large @xmath12 , the bare mass and the 1-loop correction must cancel to a large degree to yield the physical higgs mass .",
    "attempts to define naturalness quantitatively will be discussed in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : quantifying ] , but at this stage , a simple measure of naturalness may be taken to be @xmath13 for @xmath14 and the top quark with @xmath15 , eq .",

    "i.e. _ , a fine - tuning of 1 part in @xmath17 .",
    "supersymmetry moderates this fine - tuning .",
    "if supersymmetry is exact , the higgs mass receives no perturbative corrections . with supersymmetry breaking ,",
    "the higgs mass becomes @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the superpartner of fermion @xmath5 .",
    "the quadratic dependence on @xmath12 is reduced to a logarithmic one , and even for @xmath14 , the large logarithm is canceled by the loop suppression factor @xmath20 , and the higgs mass is natural , provided @xmath21 is not too far above @xmath22 .",
    "requiring a maximal fine - tuning @xmath23 , the upper bound on sfermion masses is @xmath24^{\\frac{1}{2 } } \\biggl [ \\frac{70}{\\ln ( \\lambda^2 / m_{\\tilde{f}}^2 ) }   \\biggr]^{\\frac{1}{2 } } \\biggl [ \\frac{{{\\cal{n}}}^0_{\\text{max}}}{100 } \\biggr]^{\\frac{1}{2 } } , \\label{roughbound}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 and @xmath11 have been normalized to their top quark values , the logarithm has been normalized to its value for @xmath25 , and @xmath23 has been normalized to 100 , or 1% fine - tuning .      even given this quick and simple analysis , eq .",
    "( [ roughbound ] ) already has interesting implications :    * naturalness constraints vary greatly for different superpartners . as noted as early as 1985  @xcite ,",
    "the 1-loop contributions of first and second generation particles to the higgs mass are suppressed by small yukawa couplings . for the first generation sfermions",
    ", naturalness requires only that they be below @xmath26 !",
    "in fact , this upper bound is strengthened to @xmath27 by considerations of @xmath28-term and 2-loop effects , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : natbounds ] . nevertheless , it remains true that _ without additional theoretical assumptions , there is no naturalness reason to expect first and second generation squarks and sleptons to be within reach of the lhc_. * naturalness bounds on superpartner masses are only challenged by lhc constraints for large @xmath12 , such as @xmath14 or @xmath29 , the grand unified theory ( gut ) scale . for low @xmath12 ,",
    "the loop suppression factor is not compensated by a large logarithm , and naturalness constraints are weakened by as much as an order of magnitude .",
    "for example , even for top squarks , for low @xmath12 such that @xmath30 , the naturalness bound for @xmath31 becomes @xmath32 , beyond current lhc bounds , and for @xmath33 , the bound is @xmath34 , far above even the reach of the 14 tev lhc .",
    "this is as expected for a 1-loop effect .",
    "the heuristic expectation that @xmath35 fine - tuning requires @xmath36 assumes implicitly that the 1-loop suppression factor is compensated by a large logarithm .",
    "+ of course , supersymmetry makes it possible to contemplate a perturbative theory all the way up to @xmath37 or @xmath38 , and grand unification , radiative electroweak symmetry breaking , and other key virtues of supersymmetry make this highly motivated .",

    "this observation , however , suggests that if the enhancement from large logarithms may somehow be removed , supersymmetric theories with multi - tev superpartners may nevertheless be considered natural ; this is the strategy of models that will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : focuspoint ] .",
    "* last , all naturalness bounds depend on what level of fine - tuning is deemed acceptable , with mass bounds scaling as @xmath40 .",
    "this is an irreducible subjectivity that must be acknowledged in all discussions of naturalness .",
    "+ there is a sociological observation perhaps worth making here , however . in the past ,",
    "in the absence of data , it was customary for some theorists to ask `` what regions of parameter space are most natural ? ''  and demand fine - tuning of , say , less than 10% ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "this requirement led to the promotion of models with very light superpartners , and heightened expectations that supersymmetry would be discovered as soon as the lhc began operation .",
    "+ in retrospect , however , this history has over - emphasized light supersymmetry models and has little bearing on the question of whether weak - scale supersymmetry is still tenable or not . as with all questions of this sort ,",
    "physicists vote with their feet . rather than asking `` what regions of parameter space are most natural ? '' , a more telling question is , `` if superpartners were discovered , what level of fine - tuning would be sufficient to convince you that the gauge hierarchy problem is solved by supersymmetry and you should move on to researching other problems ? ''",
    "an informal survey of responses to this question suggests that values of @xmath42 , or even higher would be acceptable . from this perspective ,",
    "the normalization of @xmath43 in eq .",
    "( [ roughbound ] ) is reasonable , and current bounds from the lhc do not yet preclude a supersymmetric solution to the hierarchy problem , especially given the many caveats associated with attempts to quantify naturalness , which will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : quantifying ] .",
    "the fact that the standard model particle content fits neatly into multiplets of larger gauge groups , such as su(5 ) , so(10 ) , or e@xmath44 , is striking evidence for guts  @xcite . in the standard model ,",
    "the strong , weak , and electromagnetic gauge couplings do not unify at any scale .",
    "however , in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , the supersymmetric extension of the standard model with minimal field content , the gauge coupling renormalization group equations ( rges ) are modified above the superpartner mass scale . with this modification ,",
    "if the superpartners are roughly at the weak scale , the gauge couplings meet at @xmath45 , further motivating both grand unification and weak - scale supersymmetry  @xcite .",
    "gauge coupling unification is sensitive to the superpartner mass scale , since this governs when the rges switch from non - supersymmetric to supersymmetric . however",
    ", the sensitivity to the superpartner mass scale is only logarithmic .",
    "furthermore , full su(5 ) multiplets of superpartners , such as complete generations of squarks and sleptons , may be heavy without ruining gauge coupling unification .",
    "note , however , that the mssm particles do not completely fill su(5 ) multiplets ; in particular , the higgs bosons must be supplemented with higgs triplets .",
    "one might therefore hope that the masses of su(2 ) doublet higgsinos might be stringently constrained by gauge coupling unification , but even this is not the case .",
    "a full justification requires a complete discussion of guts and proton decay  @xcite , but roughly speaking , heavy sfermions suppress the leading contributions to proton decay , and there is sufficient freedom in threshold corrections from the gut - scale spectrum to allow unification even for relatively heavy higgsinos ; see , _",
    "e.g. _ , refs .",
    "@xcite .    in summary ,",
    "grand unification is a significant motivation for supersymmetry , but gauge coupling unification is a blunt tool when it comes to constraining the superpartner mass scale .",
    "note , however , that the relations imposed by grand unification may have a strong impact on naturalness bounds , either weakening or strengthening them significantly ; see sec .  [",

    "supersymmetry provides an excellent wimp dark matter candidate when the neutralino is the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp )  @xcite .",
    "neutralinos naturally freeze out with approximately the correct thermal relic density .",
    "this density is inversely proportional to the thermally - averaged annihilation cross section , which , on dimensional grounds , is inversely proportional to the superpartner mass scale squared : @xmath46 the requirement @xmath47 therefore places an upper bound on the superpartner mass scale @xmath48 .",
    "unfortunately , when the constants of proportionality are included , the upper bounds for some types of neutralinos are far above current lhc sensitivities .",
    "for example , for mixed bino - higgsino  @xcite and pure wino - like  @xcite neutralino dark matter , the upper bounds are @xmath49 such neutralinos may be produced in the cascade decays of squarks and gluinos , but this is model - dependent .",

    "( [ lsplimits ] ) are far above current lhc sensitivities  @xcite .",
    "the spin - independent and spin - dependent scattering cross sections of such neutralinos are also consistent with current bounds from direct search experiments  @xcite .",
    "of course , dark matter may be composed of other particles , such as axions , sterile neutrinos , hidden sector dark matter , or gravitinos  @xcite .",
    "there is no requirement that superpartners be light in these dark matter scenarios .",
    "in fact , some scenarios in which gravitinos are the dark matter provide motivation for extremely heavy superpartners , which freeze out with @xmath50 , but then decay to gravitinos with @xmath51  @xcite . in summary ,",
    "the requirement of wimp dark matter provides upper bounds on superpartner masses , but these upper bounds are high and far beyond the reach of current colliders .",
    "in addition , the dark matter does nt have to be made of supersymmetric wimps .",
    "as with the case of grand unification , the possibility of wimp dark matter is a significant virtue of weak - scale supersymmetry , but it does not provide stringent upper bounds on superpartner masses .",
    "the search for weak - scale supersymmetry has been ongoing for decades at many colliders . before the 2013 - 14 shutdown , however , the lhc experiments atlas and cms each collected luminosities of more than @xmath52 at @xmath53 and @xmath54 at @xmath55 , and the resulting lhc limits supersede previous collider constraints in almost all scenarios",

    "there are many subjective choices and caveats associated with each of the steps outlined in sec .",
    "[ sec : prescription ] .",
    "here we highlight some of these for each step in turn .",
    "this initial step is absolutely crucial , as all naturalness studies are inescapably model - dependent . in any supersymmetry study",
    ", some fundamental framework must be adopted . in studies of other topics",
    ", however , there exists , at least in principle , the possibility of a model - independent study , where no correlations among parameters are assumed .",
    "this model - independent study is the most general possible , in that all possible results from any other ( model - dependent ) study are a subset of the model - independent study s results . in studies of naturalness , however , the correlations determine the results , and there is no possibility , even in principle , of a model - independent study in the sense described above .    given this caveat , there are two general approaches , each with their advantages and disadvantages .",
    "the first is a bottom - up approach , in which one relaxes as many theoretical assumptions as is reasonable in the hope that one might derive some generic insights .",
    "the drawback to this approach is that , since generic weak - scale supersymmetry is excluded by experimental constraints , we expect there to be structure in the supersymmetry - breaking parameters , which implies correlations , which impact naturalness .",
    "ignoring these correlations is analogous to ignoring constraints from , say , the cpt theorem , allowing the electric charges of the electron and positron to be independent parameters , and concluding that the neutrality of positronium is incredibly fine - tuned .",
    "of course , for supersymmetry , we do not know what the underlying correlations are , but we know there are some , and the only assumption that is guaranteed to be wrong is that the supersymmetry - breaking parameters are completely uncorrelated .",
    "the second approach is a top - down approach , in which one takes various theoretical frameworks seriously and analyzes their naturalness properties , incorporating all the assumed correlations of the framework .",
    "the hope is that by examining various frameworks in sufficient detail and sampling enough of them , one can derive new insights to resolve known problems .",
    "the disadvantage here , of course , is that it is unlikely that any of the known frameworks correctly captures all the correlations realized in nature .",
    "as noted above , it is important to include subleading corrections to the tree - level expression for @xmath182 .",
    "for example , it is important to use 2-loop rges and 1-loop threshold corrections , decouple superpartners at their masses , and minimize the electroweak potential at an appropriate scale ( typically the geometric mean of the stop masses ) .",
    "the tree - level expression of eq .",
    "( [ mz ] ) is very useful to obtain an intuitive understanding of many naturalness results , but it does not capture many dependencies , especially in the case of heavy superpartners .",
    "many naturalness studies differ at this step . as an example , let s consider msugra .",
    "the choice given above follows from the view that gut - scale parameters are more fundamental than weak - scale parameters and that sensitivity of the weak scale to variations in any of the parameters @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath183 , and @xmath184 is an indication of fine - tuning .",
    "another choice is simply @xmath185 = @xmath186 .",
    "the advantage of this choice is that it is extremely simple to implement .",
    "the @xmath80 parameter is ( barely ) multiplicatively renormalized , and so @xmath187 . with this choice ,",
    "naturalness is , therefore , deemed equivalent to low @xmath80 . some string - inspired models in which all squarks masses are @xmath188 are claimed to be natural based on this prescription  @xcite .",
    "such claims are subject to caveats , however . given our current understanding , the @xmath80 parameter is typically assumed to have an origin separate from the supersymmetry - breaking parameters .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to assume that it is not correlated with other parameters , and so low @xmath80 is a necessary condition for naturalness .",
    "( note , however , that the discussion of edms in sec .",
    "[ sec : edms ] provides a counterargument . )",
    "much more problematic , however , is that low @xmath80 is certainly not a sufficient condition for naturalness . in the moderate to large @xmath128 limit , eq .",
    "( [ mz ] ) becomes @xmath189 .",
    "it is certainly possible for @xmath190 to be small as the result of large cancellations . in this case",
    ", @xmath80 will be small .",
    "but this does not imply there is no fine - tuning : the relation @xmath191 with @xmath192 , @xmath193 , and @xmath194 is fine - tuned , despite the fact that @xmath195 is small .",
    "claims that such theories are natural are implicitly assuming that some unspecified correlation explains the large cancellation that yields low @xmath190 .",
    "a third possible choice for the fundamental parameters is to include not only the dimensionful supersymmetry - breaking parameters , but all of the parameters of the standard model .",
    "some naturalness studies include these  @xcite , while others do not  @xcite . from a low - energy point of view , one should include all the parameters of the lagrangian . however , by assuming some underlying high energy framework and defining our parameters at @xmath37 , we have already abandoned a purely low - energy perspective . once we consider the high - energy perspective , the case is not so clear .",
    "for example , the top yukawa coupling @xmath196 may be fixed to a specific value in a sector of the theory unrelated to supersymmetry breaking .",
    "an example of this is weakly - coupled string theory , where @xmath196 may be determined by the correlator of three string vertex operators and would therefore be fixed to some discrete value determined by the compactification geometry .",
    "the fact that all of the yukawa couplings are roughly 1 or 0 helps fuel such speculation . in such a scenario , it is clearly inappropriate to vary @xmath196 continuously to determine the sensitivity of the weak scale to variations in @xmath196 .",
    "dimensionless couplings may also be effectively fixed if they run to fixed points .",
    "other such scenarios are discussed in ref .  @xcite . in the end , it is probably reasonable to consider the fundamental parameters both with and without the dimensionless parameters and see if any interesting models emerge . note that the question of which parameters to include in the @xmath197 is independent of which parameters have been measured ; see sec .",
    "[ sec : calculating ] .",
    "a final alternative approach is to choose the fundamental parameters to be weak - scale parameters .",
    "this is perhaps the ultimate bottom - up approach , and it has the advantage of being operationally simpler than having to extrapolate to the gut or planck scales .",
    "however , as noted above , many of the motivating virtues of supersymmetry are tied to high scales , and some structure must exist if weak - scale supersymmetry is to pass experimental constraints .",
    "working at the weak - scale ignores such structure .",
    "it is possible , however , to view sensitivity to variations in electroweak parameters as a lower bound on sensitivities to variations in high - scale parameters , as they neglect large logarithm - enhanced terms ; see , _",
    "e.g. _ , ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "alternative choices , sometimes found in the literature , are @xmath198 or @xmath199 .",
    "there is little reason to choose one over the others , except in the case of scalar masses , where @xmath200 is the fundamental parameter , not @xmath76",
    "( @xmath200 may be negative , for example ) . in any case , these definitions differ by factors of only 2 or 4 , which should be ignored .",
    "this is easier said than done : for example , one definition may yield @xmath201 , or @xmath202 fine - tuning , while the other definition yields @xmath203 or @xmath204 fine - tuning , leading to a rather different impression .",
    "such examples serve as useful reminders to avoid grand conclusions based on hard cutoffs in naturalness measures .",
    "there are other caveats in defining the sensitivity parameters .",
    "the role of the sensitivity coefficients is to capture the possibility of large , canceling contributions to @xmath182 . in principle , it is possible to have a contribution to @xmath182 that is small , but rapidly varying , or large , but slowly varying .",
    "it is also possible that @xmath182 is insensitive to variations of any single parameter , but highly sensitive to variations in a linear combination of parameters . in all of these cases ,",
    "the sensitivity coefficients are highly misleading , and these possibilities again serve as reminders of how crude naturalness analyses typically are .    finally , some studies have advocated alternative definitions of sensitivity parameters that incorporate experimental uncertainties .",
    "for example , some authors have proposed that the definition of eq .",
    "( [ calni ] ) , be replaced by  @xcite @xmath205 where @xmath206 is the experimentally allowed range of @xmath207 .",
    "the intent of this definition is to encode the idea that naturalness is our attempt to determine which values of parameters are most likely to be realized in nature .    to contrast this definition with the conventional definition ,",

    "( [ calniexp ] ) , it is not . in our view , eq .",
    "( [ calniexp ] ) encodes an unconventional view of naturalness .",
    "naturalness is not a measure of our experimental knowledge of the parameters of nature .",
    "rather it is a measure of how well a given theoretical framework explains the parameters realized in nature .",
    "it is perfectly possible for values of parameters realized in nature to be unnatural  this is what the gauge hierarchy problem is !",
    " and once a parameter s value is reasonably well - known , naturalness can not be increased ( or decreased ) by more precise measurements .",
    "there are many possible ways to combine the @xmath178 to form a single measure of naturalness .",
    "a simple variation , advocated by some authors , is to add the @xmath178 in quadrature .",
    "there are also reasons to consider normalizing the @xmath178 either before or after combining them .",
    "the rationale for this is that in certain cases , all possible choices of a fundamental parameter may yield large sensitivities .",
    "a well - known example of this is the hierarchy between @xmath38 and @xmath209 , which is often considered the textbook example of how to generate a hierarchy naturally .",
    "the related sensitivity parameter , @xmath210 however , is large .",
    "the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite have argued that in such cases , only _",
    "relatively _ large sensitivities should be considered fine - tuned , and conclusions based on sensitivity parameters consistently overestimate the degree of fine - tuning required .",
    "these authors propose replacing the sensitivity parameters @xmath178 defined above , with fine - tuning parameters , defined as @xmath211 , where @xmath212 is an average sensitivity .",
    "these @xmath213 are then combined to form an overall measure of naturalness .",
    "unfortunately , the averaging procedure brings additional complications .",
    "if it is done only over a subspace of parameter space , it may mask important features  @xcite , and so it should be carried out over the entire parameter space , which is computationally intensive .",
    "in addition , it requires defining a measure on the parameter space and defining its boundaries .",
    "these additional complications have dissuaded most authors from including an averaging procedure . nevertheless , many would agree that the sensitivity parameters should , in principle , be normalized in some way , and the naturalness parameter derived from un - normalized sensitivity parameters exaggerates the fine - tuning required for a given model .",

    "they may be produced in future lhc runs , or may be beyond reach , but light enough to enhance the top content of gluino decays .",
    "the most promising lhc signals are therefore again direct stop production with cascade decays through charginos and neutralinos , or gluino production , followed by top- and bottom - rich cascade decays . as the first generation scalars are heavy but not extremely heavy , there may also be a signal in edms .",

    "this is the approach of an entirely different class of models , typically called `` supersoft supersymmetry ''  @xcite , where the mssm is extended to include a gauge adjoint chiral superfield for each gauge group , providing an interesting alternative strategy for reconciling naturalness with experimental constraints  @xcite .      in many supersymmetric models",
    ", there is a large mass splitting between the gluino and squarks at the top of the spectrum and the lighter superparters at the bottom .",

    "second , lower bounds on the masses of the lighter sparticles imply stringent lower bounds on gluino and squark masses , which decreases naturalness .    the superpartner spectrum may be much more degenerate , however .",
    "this has been explored in the context of `` compressed supersymmetry ''  @xcite , in which there are small splittings between colored superpartners and an lsp neutralino .",
    "for the reasons given above , this leads to weaker bounds on sparticle masses and provides an interesting approach to developing viable and natural models  @xcite .",
    "there are well - motivated reasons to expect large mass splittings .",

    "there are few principled ways to violate @xmath0-parity conservation .",
    "the rpv couplings can not all be sizable .",
    "in fact , there are stringent bounds on individual rpv couplings , and even more stringent bounds on products of pairs of couplings  @xcite ; in particular , if any lepton number - violating coupling and any baryon number - violating coupling are both non - zero , proton decay sets extremely stringent constraints .",
    "if theory is any guide , one might expect that the rpv couplings follow the pattern of the @xmath3-conserving couplings , with those involving the third generation the biggest , the second generation smaller , and the first smaller still .",
    "a realization of this has been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a model of @xmath3 violation based on the principle of minimal flavor violation leads to a model in which only the hadronic rpv terms @xmath275 are sizable , with @xmath276 the largest .",
    "such models somewhat moderate the naturalness motivation for @xmath3 violation , as they imply that , say , the lsp neutralino decays dominantly to top and bottom quarks , leading to @xmath277-jets , leptons , and @xmath99 from neutrinos , all distinctive characteristics that one was hoping to avoid .",
    "nevertheless , such rpv signals likely do reduce lhc limits somewhat , and , of course , one may always ignore theoretical bias and consider , say , @xmath278 couplings that would lead to decays to light flavor and pure jet signals , such as those discussed in sec .  [",

    "[ fig : lhcnomet ] .    in summary ,",
    "as with compressed supersymmetry , @xmath3 violation provides another possibility for reducing the distinctiveness of supersymmetry signals at colliders and potentially improving the naturalness of viable models .",
    "the shortcomings , however , are also similar : if all of the superpartners are light , the higgs boson is generically too light , requiring physics beyond the mssm , and the edm constraints are generically not satisfied , requiring yet more structure to remove troubling cp - violating phases . in rpv supersymmetry",
    ", one also loses the motivation of wimp dark matter , although the gravitino or other candidates may play this role .",
    "supersymmetry has long been the leading candidate for new physics at the weak scale . in this review",

    "the leading theoretical motivations for weak - scale supersymmetry are naturalness , grand unification , and wimp dark matter .",

    "we have especially emphasized the robustness of the edm constraints , which are present even in flavor - conserving theories . in the absence of a compelling mechanism for suppressing cp violation ,",
    "the edm constraints require first generation sfermions to be well above the tev scale . against the backdrop of these indirect constraints , lhc bounds on supersymmetry",
    "are significant because they are direct , but they are hardly game - changing .",
    "one may like supersymmetry or not , but to have thought it promising in 2008 and to think it much less promising now is surely the least defensible viewpoint .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : quantifying ] , we have critically examined attempts to quantify naturalness .",
    "there are many studies embodying philosophies that differ greatly from each other .",
    "we have expressed reservations about some , but for many , one can only acknowledge the subjective nature of naturalness and make explicit the underlying assumptions .",
    "very roughly speaking , however , current bounds are beginning to probe naturalness parameters of @xmath279 , corresponding to gluino masses of 1 tev .    in sec .",

    "[ fig : spectrum_effective ] , [ fig : spectrum_fp ] , and [ fig : spectrum_compressed ] .",
    "although supersymmetry does not work `` out of the box , '' these models provide longstanding ( pre - lhc ) and well - motivated frameworks that remain viable and preserve naturalness at the 1% level .    in summary ,",
    "weak - scale supersymmetry is neither unscathed , nor is it dead .",
    "the true status is somewhere in between , and requires a nuanced view that incorporates at least some of the many caveats and subtleties reviewed here .",
    "thankfully , the status quo will not last long , given expected experimental progress on many fronts . in particular , after the two - year shutdown from 2013 - 14 , the lhc is currently expected to begin running again at @xmath280 in 2015 , with initial results available by summer 2015 , and @xmath281 of data analyzed by 2018 .",
    "such a jump in energy and luminosity will push the reach in gluino and squark masses from around 1 tev to around 3 - 4 tev , and probe models that are roughly an order of magnitude less natural .",

    "<S> for decades , the unnaturalness of the weak scale has been the dominant problem motivating new particle physics , and weak - scale supersymmetry has been the dominant proposed solution . </S>",
    "<S> this paradigm is now being challenged by a wealth of experimental data . in this review , we begin by recalling the theoretical motivations for weak - scale supersymmetry , including the gauge hierarchy problem , grand unification , and wimp dark matter , and their implications for superpartner masses . </S>",
    "<S> these are set against the leading constraints on supersymmetry from collider searches , the higgs boson mass , and low - energy constraints on flavor and cp violation . </S>",
    "<S> we then critically examine attempts to quantify naturalness in supersymmetry , stressing the many subjective choices that impact the results both quantitatively and qualitatively . finally , we survey various proposals for natural supersymmetric models , including effective supersymmetry , focus point supersymmetry , compressed supersymmetry , and @xmath0-parity - violating supersymmetry , and summarize their key features , current status , and implications for future experiments .    naturalness , supersymmetry , grand unification , dark matter , higgs boson , particle colliders </S>"
