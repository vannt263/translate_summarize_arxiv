    "the tendency of an increase of the dephasing rate with increasing rydberg atom number is confirmed by conducting numerical calculations for the rotary echo experiment .",
    "both , the measurement as well as the numerical simulations , are well described by the same exponent for a power law dependence of the dephasing rate on the maximal rydberg atom number and is close to the naively expected one for a dephasing due to the van der waals interaction .",
    "furthermore , it is shown that the dephasing coefficients of the power law dependence are equal within the accuracy of the measurement .",
    "this result is remarkable in the sense , that the two experiments that are used to obtain the dephasing rates are conducted on completely different time scales . in future experiments strongly interacting frozen rydberg gases",
