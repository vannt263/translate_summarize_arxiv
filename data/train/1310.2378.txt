    "one of the most studied problems in graph theory is the disjoint paths problem ( dpp ) : _ given a graph @xmath0 , and a set of @xmath2 pairs of terminals , @xmath9 @xmath10 , decide whether @xmath0 contains @xmath2 vertex - disjoint paths @xmath11 where @xmath12 has endpoints @xmath3 and @xmath4 , @xmath13_. in addition to its numerous applications in areas such as network routing and vlsi layout , this problem has been the catalyst for extensive research in algorithms and combinatorics @xcite .",
    "dpp is np - complete , along with its edge - disjoint or directed variants , even when the input graph is planar  @xcite .",
    "the celebrated algorithm of roberson and seymour solves it however in @xmath6 steps , where @xmath14 is some computable function  @xcite .",
    "this implies that when we parameterize dpp by the number @xmath2 of terminals , the problem is fixed - parameter tractable .",
    "the robertson - seymour algorithm is the central algorithmic result of the graph minors series of papers , one of the deepest and most influential bodies of work in graph theory .",
    "the basis of the algorithm in  @xcite is the so - called _ irrelevant - vertex technique _ which can be summarized very roughly as follows .",
    "as long as the input graph @xmath0 violates certain structural conditions , then it is possible to find a vertex @xmath15 that is _ solution - irrelevant : _ every collection of paths certifying a solution to the problem can be rerouted to an _ equivalent _ one , that links the same pairs of terminals , but in which the new paths avoid @xmath16 one then iteratively removes such irrelevant vertices until the structural conditions are met . by that point",
    "the graph has been simplified enough so that the problem can be attacked via dynamic programming .",
    "the following two structural conditions are used by the algorithm in  @xcite : ( i ) @xmath0 excludes a clique , whose size depends on @xmath2 , as a minor and ( ii ) @xmath0 has treewidth bounded by some function of @xmath17 when it comes to enforcing condition ( ii ) , the aim is to prove that in graphs without big clique - minors and with treewidth at least @xmath7 there is always a solution - irrelevant vertex .",
    "this is the most complicated part of the proof and it was postponed until the later papers in the series @xcite .",
    "the bad news is that the complicated proofs also imply an _",
    "immense _ parametric dependence , as expressed by the function @xmath18 of the running time on the parameter @xmath17 this puts the algorithm outside the realm of feasibility even for elementary values of @xmath17 the ideas above were powerful enough to be applicable also to problems outside the context of the graph minors series . during the last decade ,",
    "they have been applied to many other combinatorial problems and now they constitute a basic paradigm in parameterized algorithm design ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . however , in most applications , the need for overcoming the high parameter dependence emerging from the structural theorems of the graph minors series , especially those in @xcite , remains imperative .",
    "hence two natural directions of research are : simplify parts of the original proof for the general case or focus on specific graph classes that may admit proofs with better parameter dependence .",
    "an important step in the first direction was taken recently by kawarabayashi and wollan in  @xcite who gave an easier and shorter proof of the results in @xcite . while the parameter dependence of the new proof is certainly much better than the previous , immense , function , it is still huge : a rough estimation from  @xcite gives a lower bound for @xmath7 of magnitude @xmath19 which in turn implies a lower bound for @xmath20 of magnitude @xmath21    in this paper we offer a solid advance in the second direction , focusing on planar graphs ( see also  @xcite for previous results on planar graphs ) .",
    "we show that , for planar graphs , @xmath7 is singly exponential . in particular we prove the following result .",
    "[ main ] every instance of dpp  consisting of a planar graph @xmath0 with treewidth at least @xmath22 and @xmath2 pairs of terminals contains a vertex @xmath15 such that every solution to dpp can be replaced by an equivalent one whose paths avoid  @xmath16    the proof of theorem  [ main ] is presented in section  [ sec : ub ] and deviates significantly from those in  @xcite .",
    "it is self - contained and exploits extensively the combinatorics of planar graphs . given a dpp  instance defined on a planar graph @xmath23 we prove that if @xmath0 contains as a subgraph a subdivision of a sufficiently large ( exponential in @xmath2 ) grid , whose `` perimeter '' does not enclose any terminal , the `` central '' vertex @xmath15 of the grid is solution - irrelevant for this instance .",
    "it follows that the `` area '' provided by the grid is big enough so that every solution that uses @xmath15 can be rerouted to an equivalent one that does not go so deep in the grid and therefore avoids the vertex @xmath15 .",

    "it follows that the `` area '' provided by the grid is big enough so that every solution that uses @xmath15 can be rerouted to an equivalent one that does not go so deep in the grid and therefore avoids the vertex @xmath15 .",
    "combining theorem  [ main ] with known algorithmic results , it is possible to reduce , in @xmath24 steps , a planar instance of dpp   to an equivalent one whose graph has treewidth @xmath25 then , using standard dynamic programming on tree decompositions , a solution , if one exists , can be found in @xmath26 steps .",
