    "generation time is a major feature of organisms , whose evolution is usually considered through the prism of life - history strategies  _ i.e. _ combinations of traits that often impact generation time , like adult survival or the age of reproductive maturity .",
    "why there exist populations or species with long generation times can be intriguing , as in a stable non - limiting environment the most evolutionary successful strategy is the one that grows most rapidly @xcite .",
    "life - history strategies that reduce generation time  `` fast strategies '' hereafter  thus benefit from a selective advantage over `` slow strategies '' in this context .",
    "whenever population growth is limited , however , the advantage to a fast strategy may vanish . in this context , the selective advantage of a mutant is given by the number of viable offspring it is expected to produce , also known as its net reproductive rate @xmath0 @xcite : whether the mutant breeds shortly or not , or produces few or many litters , is not seen by selection .",
    "many life - history traits influence both the generation time and the @xmath0 , such that their evolutionary dynamics are often thought to be dominated by selection @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , heritable changes in life - history traits may not necessarily be filtered stringently by selection because negative relationships ( trade - offs ) exist between these traits and restrict their ability to vary independently @xcite .",
    "life - history strategies are indeed distributed along trade - offs whose shapes are often sufficient to predict which strategy , if any , is the most likely to evolve by selection .",
    "the role of trade - off shapes is well illustrated by the case of reproduction strategies , which can be thought as distributed along a trade - off between the number of litters produced during an adult s lifetime ( ` longevity ' hereafter ) and the size of each litter @xcite .",
    "a convex trade - off means that litter size decreases rapidly with longevity , such that semelparous individuals , who reproduce only once , produce a larger number of offspring in their adult life on average .",
    "such a trade - off may appropriately describe the case of a species where adults have a fixed amount of resources to allocate to either reproduction or maintenance , such that increasing adult survival  through higher investment in maintenance  would be at the cost of a decreased lifetime fecundity . because semelparous individuals produce more offspring faster , semelparity outcompetes any other reproduction strategy under this trade - off .",
    "now consider the case where adults can acquire resources during their lifetime : this new source of energy may partly or fully compensate for the energy allocated to maintenance , and make the trade - off less convex or linear .",
    "the acquired energy may even overcompensate the investment in maintenance  and make the trade - off concave  such that iteroparous ( long lived ) strategies have higher @xmath0s than the semelparous .",
    "one can always find a trade - off shape that keeps the @xmath0 constant among strategies ; for the case of reproductive strategies , this condition is met when litter size decreases linearly as adult survival increases  the linear trade - off described above .",
    "this is an ideal setup to identify other players in the evolutionary dynamics of slow / fast strategies than the obvious selective advantage provided by a higher @xmath0 ; bulmer @xcite , for instance , used it to demonstrate that environmental variability may select for iteroparity in a density - dependent environment .",
    "we first use this setup and study the impact of neutral processes on the evolutionary dynamics of two classes of life - history strategies associated with generation time : reproductive strategies and development duration . we confirm that the strategies considered , although they yield different generation times , are neutral in this situation : none is expected to increase or decrease in frequency , on average , in a pairwise competition .",
    "next we investigate their neutral evolutionary dynamics and show that the most probable strategy at the evolutionary equilibrium is the slowest one , _",
    "i.e. _ maximum longevity or duration of development .",
    "this is due to a newly discovered evolutionary process that we called ` turnover bias ' , whereby slow strategies are replaced after a longer time on average , so they are more likely to be observed .",
    "we also verify that turnover bias still modifies the evolutionary outcome when a specific strategy is selected .",
    "turnover bias is most impacting when neutral processes like genetic drift dominate over selection , which occurs when selection is weak and/or when the effective population size is small @xcite .",
    "this defines the conditions where turnover bias should be an important determinant of the evolution of life - history strategies .",
    "we first consider a monomorphic population living in a stable environment with limited resources .",
    "the population is constituted by @xmath1 juveniles and @xmath2 adults , whose dynamics can be described by the discrete system ( [ eq : res0 ] ) : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the survival of juveniles becoming adults , @xmath5 the lifetime fecundity , and @xmath6 a density - dependent egg ( or newborn ) survival .",
    "there are two ways of changing the generation time in this model : by increasing adult longevity  by increasing the probability that an adult survives until the next reproductive season , @xmath7  or by increasing the duration of development  by increasing the probability that a juvenile remains a juvenile at the next reproductive season , @xmath8 .",
    "we study the evolution of @xmath7 and @xmath8 separately  while setting the other , @xmath8 or @xmath7 , to @xmath9  in the two distinct models ( denoted 1 and 2 hereafter ) described in fig .",
    "[ fig : models ] . as a consequence ,",
    "all strategies have the same age at maturity ( @xmath10 ) when reproduction strategies evolve , and are all semelparous when development duration evolves .",

    "+ + + + + + + +    the reproduction strategy is described by the continuous variable @xmath7 , the survival of adults from one reproductive event to the next .",
    "adults with @xmath11 are semelparous : they reproduce once and die .",
    "iteroparity arises as soon as @xmath7 is above @xmath9 , and the mean number of reproductive events increases with @xmath7  it equals @xmath12 .",
    "fecundity per reproduction event equals @xmath13 , which ensures that the number of offspring produced by an adult within its lifetime is independent of its reproduction strategy , so that all strategies have equal @xmath0 .    each egg or newborn produced survives with the density - dependent probability @xmath6 , which decreases as the overall number produced , @xmath14 , increases .",
    "we do not assign a specific density - dependence function to @xmath6 at this point ; instead , we assume that this function eventually yields a non - zero equilibrium where @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "this property is shared by many classical density - dependence functions , given a parameterization that avoids cyclic or chaotic dynamics ( see si texts 1 - 2 and figs .",
    "s1-s4 ) . in consequence ,",
    "the population dynamics simplify to : @xmath17 for model 1  the system ( [ eq : res1 ] ) corresponds to ( [ eq : res0 ] ) with @xmath18 . by solving the system ,",
    "we show that at equilibrium the product of the lifetime potential fecundity @xmath5 and of the density - dependent egg survival @xmath6 equals @xmath19 .",
    "this property also emerges when @xmath6 is formulated explicitly ( si text 1 and figs .",
    "this implies that all strategies reach a stable equilibrium where they have the same lifetime density - dependent fecundity .",
    "we now model the evolutionary dynamics of the reproduction strategy by considering the fate of a single mutant with strategy @xmath20 appearing in a monomorphic population ( with strategy @xmath7 ) whose dynamics are described by the system ( [ eq : res1 ] ) .",
    "we use here the adaptive dynamics framework , which commonly assumes that mutations are rare enough for the resident population to reach an equilibrium before a mutant appears @xcite . as we have seen , at this equilibrium the resident s lifetime fecundity @xmath21 equals @xmath19 .",
    "another classical assumption of adaptive dynamics is that the resident population is large enough for the mutant to be negligibly rare at the beginning of the invasion .",
    "the density - dependent parameter @xmath6 thus only depends on @xmath14 and the mutant s lifetime fecundity @xmath21 equals that of the resident , @xmath19  we relax the two assumptions above later ( see _ turnover bias in polymorphic populations _ ) , with no visible impact on our results .",
    "the dynamics of the mutant can thus be modeled with the following system : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the number of surviving eggs laid by the mutant at time @xmath24 . in the appendix , we show that all mutants have equal growth rates  regardless of the resident they compete with  such that no reproduction strategy should increase ( or decrease ) in frequency in response to selection .",

    "again , we assume that @xmath29 is small enough for a mutation to appear and fix ( or go extinct ) before another mutation occurs .",

    "a proportion @xmath8 are juveniles remaining juveniles , while a proportion @xmath56 become adults that will produce new juveniles at a mean rate @xmath19  thus a proportion @xmath57 is generated this way .",
    "of course , only the latter are subject to mutation , such that the evolutionary dynamics of @xmath8 may be described by equations ( [ eq : mark][eq : mark2 ] ) , substituting @xmath7 with @xmath8 .",

    "the models described in the two sections above rely on the assumption that mutations are rare , so that the population is only transiently polymorphic .",
    "moreover , in the neutral markov chain , mutants can only reach neighboring reproduction strategies , even though the degree of iteroparity or development duration might vary continuously .",
    "these assumptions can be relaxed in individual - based simulations where mutations occur with probability @xmath29 and change the offspring strategy from its parent s by an amount sampled from a continuous distribution ( see _ simulation procedure _ in the material and methods section ) .",
    "the model otherwise matches the discrete life cycle described above ( see equation  [ eq : res0 ] ) .    at each timestep , a juvenile with genotype @xmath36 can either remain a juvenile ( with probability @xmath58 ) or attempt to become an adult ( probability @xmath59 ) ; then it survives with probability @xmath4 .",

    "we also studied another form of density - dependency and obtained very similar results to those presented in figure  [ fig : res_sim ] ( si text 2 and fig .",
    "it is worth noting that the population size is not strictly constant in this model : the density dependent process can yield population sizes above or below its expected equilibrium .",
    "this may impact the resulting evolutionary dynamics , because fast strategies perform better when the whole population growth rate is above @xmath10 , while slow strategies are more able to wait for better conditions when this rate is below @xmath10 .",

    "these results confirm that slow strategies are generally expected to evolve in a stable , density - dependent environment .",
    "above we considered a constant mutation rate among the various litters produced by an individual . by doing so",
    ", we neglected the well - known fact that , in many species , the mutation rate can increase with one or both parents age @xcite .",
    "this increase is likely due to a large extent to an increase in the number of germline cell divisions @xcite .",
    "this raises two distinct issues : that iteroparous individuals may be biased towards producing more mutants later in life , and that maybe this yields an increase in the overall mutation rate as the degree of iteroparity increases .",
    "the first issue likely remains a minor one as long as the overall mutation rate is small : iteroparous individuals will produce mutants late in life instead of throughout , which will not affect the evolutionary dynamics as long as the overall mutation rate remains equal between strategies .",
    "the second issue is more problematic and needs to be resolved here : an increase in the mutation rate with the degree of iteroparity could , in theory , revert the neutral dynamics and make semelparity the most likely outcome under the linear trade - off .",
    "it is trivial , from equations ( [ eq : mark ] ) and ( [ eq : mark2 ] ) , that a mutation rate @xmath29 increasing from a basal rate @xmath78 at a higher rate than the function @xmath79 would produce such a result , so we need to address the question ` how much does the mutation rate per generation increase with iteroparity ? ' .",
    "we need to build a model to obtain this relationship , which as far as we know has not been determined empirically .",
    "we assume that a batch of gametes is produced each time an individual reproduces , of a size proportional to the number of offspring it is expected to yield at this reproductive season ( si text 3 ) .",
    "the overall number of gametes produced is thus constant among strategies , yet our model shows that producing them at once  as semelparous do  reduces the overall number of cell divisions in the germline . in consequence , the average mutation rate per gamete increases with longevity , but the difference is negligible whenever the number of gametes produced in a lifetime is large .",
    "for instance , if @xmath80 gametes should be produced in a lifetime , an iteroparous individual with @xmath81  living @xmath82 reproductive seasons on average  would have an average mutation rate increased by @xmath83 compared to a semelparous individual .",
    "this number raises to @xmath84 if the number of gametes produced in a lifetime equals @xmath47 .",
    "how may this phenomenon affect the neutral evolution of reproduction strategies ?",
    "in the previous sections , we showed that highly iteroparous strategies were scarcely replaced due to their long generation times . a higher mean mutation rate of iteroparous individuals might ( over)compensate the bias and favor the evolution of semelparity .",
    "we replaced the mutation rate in the markov chain described by equations ( [ eq : mark ] ) and ( [ eq : mark2 ] ) with that given by equation ( [ eq : mean ] ) , such that the equilibrium now depends on the number of gametes produced in a lifetime , @xmath85 .",
    "we consider that the number of batches @xmath86 of a strategy with adult survival @xmath27 equals its mean longevity , @xmath87 .",
    "we set the mutation rate per cell division to @xmath88 and checked that this parameter has no impact on the equilibrium distribution . in figure",
    "[ fig : mark_res2 ] , we show the resulting markov chain equilibrium with @xmath89 : the highest degree of iteroparity remains the most likely evolutionary outcome , although in this situation semelparity and weak iteroparity are more likely to evolve than when aging is ignored . decreasing @xmath85 to the unrealistically low value of @xmath90 does not change these results qualitatively ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mark_res3 ] ) .",
    "it is legitimate to ask whether turnover bias can have an impact on the evolutionary dynamics of generation time in the presence of selection .",
    "consider first * a two - allele haploid model * where the two alleles yield the two reproduction strategies @xmath76 and @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "turnover bias favors the evolution of @xmath91 because this strategy generates fewer mutations per time unit , and selection can counteract this process by increasing the fixation probability of @xmath76 ( denoted @xmath93 ) and decreasing that of @xmath91 ( @xmath94 ) from their value in the neutral model ( @xmath30 in the previous section ) .",
    "the bias is entirely canceled when : @xmath95 such that it is equally probable to evolve to @xmath76 from a population where @xmath91 is fixed than the reverse .",
    "assuming that the fitness advantage of @xmath76 over @xmath91 equals @xmath96 ( and the fitness disadvantage of @xmath91 @xmath97 ) , we can calculate @xcite : @xmath98 the equilibrium in equation [ eq : eq ] is thus obtained for : @xmath99 @xmath96 increases as the difference between @xmath76 and @xmath91 increases  _",
    "i.e. _ when turnover bias is more acute  and when the population size decreases and selection consequently becomes less efficient .",
    "for instance , in a population of size @xmath47 , a semelparous allele ( @xmath100 ) would need to provide a selective advantage of about @xmath101 to be as likely to evolve as an iteroparous allele with @xmath102 .",
    "now consider , as we did in previous sections , that reproduction strategies can * vary continuously * , distributed along a trade - off between litter size and longevity .",
    "the shape of the trade - off determines the selective value of any strategy competing with others .",
    "a convex trade - off appropriately sets a selection gradient in the opposite direction to turnover bias .",
    "we model such a trade - off by changing the number of eggs produced by an adult with genotype @xmath36 in our simulations , @xmath103 , from @xmath104 to @xmath105 , with @xmath106 .",
    "the trade - off is linear when @xmath107 and becomes increasingly convex as @xmath108 increases , making selection for semelparity stronger .",
    "the evolutionarily expected reproduction strategies are represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : selection ] . in large populations ( @xmath109 )",

    ", the level of iteroparity @xmath7 decreases with @xmath108 , at a slower rate when the population size is smaller ( @xmath110 _ vs _ @xmath111 ) .",
    "this result is typical of evolutionary dynamics where neutral and selective processes act in opposite directions : selection is most efficient in large populations  favoring the evolution of semelparity in the present case  such that turnover bias has a small effect on the evolutionary dynamics in this situation . as the population size decreases , selection becomes less efficient and the evolving reproduction strategy is the result of a balance between turnover bias and selection .",
    "life - history strategies that influence the generation time but not the lifetime reproductive success are known to be neutral in a density - dependent environment yielding stable population dynamics @xcite , suggesting a minor role of the generation time in their evolution . here",
    "we show that a bias favors the evolution of the slowest possible life - history strategy  that with the longest generation time .",
    "indeed , individuals adopting ( fast ) strategies with short generation times produce many offspring per time unit ( and thus many mutants ) , while slow strategies instead favor the survival of their carriers ( who do not mutate ) .",
    "therefore , a fast strategy is more likely to be replaced shortly , and is less likely to be observed than a slow strategy .",
    "this logic should be applicable to any trait or strategy associated with generation time .",
    "we modeled the evolution of two of them : reproduction strategies , where the fast semelparous compete with the slow iteroparous , and developmental timing where juveniles can develop readily ( fast ) or wait ( slow ) .",
    "turnover bias  as we called it  is an unescapable part of the evolutionary dynamics of strategies with different generation times .",
    "this bias impacts the occurrence of mutations but not their fixation ; we actually detected it by building an `` origin - fixation model '' ( ofm ) that separates the two processes .",
    "ofms are rarely applied to life - history strategies , which might partly explain why turnover bias has not been identified earlier  the framework of adaptive dynamics is often preferred , which takes its roots in an ofm to build the canonical equation but then usually ignores differences in the mutation - generating process among alternative strategies @xcite . to our knowledge , only proulx and day @xcite have built an ofm to study the evolution of a trait associated with the generation time .",
    "they have considered differences in fixation probabilities among strategies , but not in their rates of mutation appearance per time unit , rendering it impossible to detect the bias .",
    "interestingly , ofms are ideal but not necessary to identify turnover bias : we still observe the bias in simple individual - based simulations ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : res_sim ] )  where origin and fixation are not formally separated  which are rather common in theoretical evolutionary ecology .",
    "an expected feature of biases of the mutational process is that their contribution to evolutionary dynamics is maximum when alternative alleles have similar fixation probabilities , that is when allele fixation is mainly due to neutral processes like genetic drift @xcite .",
    "our results indeed indicate that turnover bias impacts the evolutionary outcome more strongly when the selective values of the strategies in competition are close and/or when the population is small .",
    "when selection strongly favors the fixation of one specific strategy ( or of a range thereof ) , turnover bias is still acting but its effects are negligible",
    ". we should thus expect to observe turnover bias after the fixation of some neutral or nearly neutral mutations , which may take a long time compared to the fixation of advantageous mutations .",
    "turnover bias may therefore only yield differences along evolutionary timescales where numerous neutral substitutions occur .",
    "it might thus explain a part of the extraordinary diversity of life - history strategies reported across large phylogenetic trees ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) , while its role at the population level may be contingent on specific population parameters .",
    "the importance of turnover bias in nature thus relies on how often selection is inefficient among strategies with different turnovers .",
    "it might be a very special and rare situation , but the factual truth is that we lack empirical evidence to support this claim : selection among strategies distributed along a trade - off depends on the shape of the trade - off , which is scarcely inferred .",
    "this is likely due to statistical issues : relatively small samples allow the detection of negative relationships between traits , whereas inferring precise relationships between traits requires many accurate observations .",
    "a promising approach consists in obtaining trade - off shapes through mechanistic models of the genetic , physiological and ecological processes that contribute to them @xcite  evolutionary epidemiologists have studied the virulence - persistence trade - off using mechanistic models @xcite , but we are not aware of their application to other trade - offs .",
    "we have ignored other , potentially important selection pressures that may contribute to the evolutionary dynamics of strategies associated with the generation time .",
    "bet - hedging strategies , for instance , evolve as a response to environmental fluctuations and are often characterized by longer generation times than those selected by a constant environment , as exemplified by iteroparity or facultative dormancy @xcite .",
    "this prediction contrast with a recent study by mitteldorf and martins @xcite showing that a fluctuating environment can select for short generation times , by creating repeated episodes of directional selection .",
    "this gives a selective advantage to genotypes adapting quickly , which can be achieved by fast strategies as they produce more mutants per time unit .",
    "this apparent theoretical conflict  a fluctuating environment can favor both slow and fast strategies  needs to be resolved . in any case , the role of turnover bias in this context remains unclear , as the fluctuating environment both provides a selection pressure for a specific strategy and reduces drastically the effective population size .",
    "we have also ignored the role of deleterious mutations , which are known to be the most frequent kind of mutations in a stable environment @xcite .",
    "purging selection in presence of these mutations would likely favor genotypes producing fewer mutants .",
    "this might create a selection pressure for slow strategies , even in stable environments .",
    "we have not considered the genetic architecture of the evolving traits , as it can not change turnover bias directly .",
    "turnover bias results from traits impacting the generation time , regardless of their genetic , physiological or developmental components .",
    "nonetheless , the genetic architecture may play a ( distinct ) major role in the evolutionary dynamics of the traits considered , as it should determine the mutation rates from one strategy to others .",
    "if theses rates are uneven , a mutational bias should occur that may change the evolutionary outcome .",
    "mutation biases are known to play a role in the evolution of molecular traits @xcite but they are rarely considered for phenotypic traits ( but see @xcite ) .",

    "<S> we first study the evolution of life - history strategies with different generation times in this context , and show that those with the longest generation time represent the most likely evolutionary outcomes . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , strategies with longer generation times generate fewer mutants per time unit , which makes them less likely to be replaced within a given time period . </S>",
    "<S> this ` turnover bias ' inevitably exists and favors the evolution of strategies with long generation times . </S>",
