    "black hole is one of the most important key objects in theoretical physics . though its quantum behavior and thermodynamic property have played great roles in the path to understand yet unknown quantum theory of gravity ( see e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite ) , a direct experimental test had been believed almost impossible .",
    "recently , the scenarios of large  @xcite and warped  @xcite extra dimension(s ) have led to an amazing possibility of producing black holes at future colliders with distinct signals  @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite for studies before the observation  @xcite that black holes radiate mainly on the brane ) .    when the center - of - mass ( cm ) energy of a collision exceeds the planck scale , which is of the order of tev here , the cross section is dominated by a black hole production  @xcite , which is predicted to be of the order of the geometrical one  @xcite , increasing with the cm energy .",
    "in this trans - planckian energy domain , the larger the cm energy is , the larger the mass of the resulting black hole is , and hence the better its decay is treated semi - classically via hawking radiation  @xcite .",
    "main purpose of this series of work is to discuss such decay signals in the hope that these will serve as the basis to pursue stringy or quantum gravitational corrections to them .    in previous publications ,",
    "we have pointed out that the production cross section of a black hole increases with its angular momentum , so that the produced black holes are highly rotating  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for an earlier attempt ) . the form factor for the production cross section ,",
    "taking this rotation into account  @xcite , is larger than unity and increases with the number of dimensions @xmath3 .",
    "the result is in good agreement with an independent numerical simulation of a classical gravitational collision of two massless point particles  @xcite .",
    "we note that this form factor is hardly interpretative without considering the angular momentum .",
    "it is indispensable to take into account the angular momentum of the black hole when we perform a realistic calculation of its production and evaporation .",
    "black holes radiate mainly into the standard model fields that are localized on the brane  @xcite . in the previous paper  @xcite",
    ", we have shown that the massless brane field equations with spin zero , one - half and one , i.e. for all the standard model fields , are of variables separable type in the rotating black hole background .",
    "then we obtained the analytic expressions for the greybody factor of @xmath4 ( randall - sundrum 1 ) black hole by solving the master equation under the low energy approximation of radiating field . in this work we present a generalized result to higher dimensional black hole in @xmath5 for brane localized scalar field without relying on the low energy approximation and",
    "discuss its physical implications .",

    "the @xmath24 is the greybody factor that determines the departure from black body spectrum , which is the main object of this paper .",
