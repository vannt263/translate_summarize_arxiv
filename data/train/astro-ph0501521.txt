    "the hardness ratio derived from the xmm pn spectrum with a power law model with galactic and intrinsic absorption as given in table[br2237_spec ] suggests a much harder spectrum with hr=0.82 . on the other hand , if we use the power law model ( @xmath2=0.87 ) with galactic absorption only , the resulting hr=0.52 which is consistent with the hr measured from the pspc .",

    "we find a mild trend of @xmath1   decreasing with @xmath2 , but this is not a secure correlation .",
    "high redshift radio - loud quasars are more luminous in x - rays and have flatter x - ray spectra compared to the radio - quiet quasars .",
    "this difference in the two populations is similar to that observed in low redshift @xcite .",
    "based upon studies of hardness ratios and flux estimates of a handful of sources bechtold et al ( 1994 ) claimed that high redshift radio - loud quasars are more absorbed than their radio - quiet cousins , suggesting an intrinsic difference over and above that already present at low redshift .",
    "elvis et al .",
    "( 1994 ) obtained rosat spectra of three radio - loud and 3 radio - quiet quasars .",
    "amoung the radio - loud objects , only one showed @xmath37 absorption .",
    "statistically significant ( @xmath104 ) intrinsic absorption is present only in 2 out of 5 radio - loud quasars in our sample .",
    "thus , there is some evidence for the high redshift radio - loud quasars to be more absorbed than the radio - quiet quasars , even though the sample size is small ; the x - ray spectra of absorbed quasars , however , appear to be dominated by the jet emission .",
    "we find clear evidence for the 10 radio - quiet quasars with x - ray spectra in our sample to have steep spectral slopes @xmath105=1.23@xmath30.48 comparable to those in nls1 galaxies at low redshift . if we exclude sdss j1401 + 0244 , which may be a radio - loud quasar , the mean and standard deviation change to @xmath105=1.33@xmath30.38 .",
    "if we use a flatter slope for br 03511034 ( without intrinsic absorption ) , then the mean and standard deviation become @xmath98=1.20@xmath30.48 for all the 10 radio - quiet sources and @xmath98=1.30@xmath30.44 excluding sdss j1401 + 0244 .",
    "this is an exciting new result and gives credence to the hypothesis of @xcite that nls1s are low - redshift cousins of high - redshift quasars , in that they are highly accreting and contain rapidly growing black holes .",
    "moreover , the high eddinton luminosities independently derived for some of our targets , e.g. bri 0103@xmath1060032 , pss j0248@xmath1061802 and br 2237@xmath330607 , support the general result . the mean spectral slope that we find is consistent with that found by vignali et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and shemmer et al .",
    "( 2005 ) within the errors .",
    "a joint fit performed on chandra and xmm data of eight radio - quiet z@xmath0 quasars led to an `` average '' @xmath107 by shemmer et al .",
    "similarly vignali et al . performed a joint fit to 48 radio - quiet quasars and got an average @xmath108 .",
    "we have shown above that the comparison of spectral shapes between high redshift quasars and low redshift seyferts is not significantly affected by spectral complexity of lower - luminosy seyferts .",
    "it is very useful to make such a comparison because we have well determined eddington luminosities only for the seyfert population . while we are making progress in determining spectral shapes , black hole masses and eddington luminosities in luminous quasars ,",
    "these studies are still not done for well defined samples and are fraught with difficulties .",
    "shemmer et al .",
    "( 2004 ) studied high redshift quasars in the redshift range @xmath109 and came to conclusions very similar to ours .",
    "they determined black hole masses using h@xmath94 widths for their sample objects and found them to have high eddington luminosities , similar to nls1s , and distinct from bls1s .",
    "they also found that such highly accreting sources , including nls1 have high metallicities as suggested by mathur ( 2000 ) ( see also fields et al .",
    "thus there appears to be mounting evidence for similarity of properties between nls1s and high redshift quasars .",
    "whether all luminous quasars share these properties remains to be seen .",
    "in a recent study piconcelli et al .",
    "( 2005 ) performed a systematic analysis of low redshift ( z@xmath110 ) luminous quasars from the palomar - green ( pg ) bright quasar sample .",
    "they found a mean power - law slope of @xmath111 for radio - quiet quasars .",
    "this slope is also statistically consistent with what we find for z@xmath0 quasars , and similar to those of nls1s .",
    "the above results imply that perhaps _ most _ luminous quasars radiate at close to eddington luminosity , based on their x - ray spectral shape .",
    "this may not be a correct interpretation of the observations if correlation of @xmath2 with l / l@xmath112 seen in seyferts ( e.g. williams et al .",
    "2004 ) does not extend to luminous quasars , with high mass black holes . however , there is some indication in the literature that such an interpretation may in fact be true .",
    "corbett et al .",
    "( 2003 ) estimated black hole masses for a large number of quasars over a range of luminosity and found that black hole mass is proportional to luminosity .",
    "this implies that the eddinton luminosity of all quasars may be similar .",
    "given the large error in the correlation equation in corbett et al . , it is not obvious , however , what that eddington ratio is .",
    "that they all may have high eddinton luminosity , similar to nls1s , is only speculative at this stage ( but see shemmer et al .",
    "2004 ) ; we wish to draw definitive conclusions on the properties of our own sample only .",
    "the evidence presented in this paper , and other results quoted above , support the idea that both high redshift quasars and nls1s accrete at high eddington rate .",
    "there is , however , one major difference in the two populations .",
    "the high redshift quasars are also very luminous objects , containing massive black holes of @xmath113 @xmath20   or so ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "thus it appears that while high mass black holes accrete at high rates and grow most of their mass at high redshift , the low mass black holes , as in some nls1s , accrete at high rate and grow most of their mass at low redshift .",
    "this scenario appears to be consistent with `` anti - hierarchical '' black hole growth found from the studies of x - ray background ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we would like to thank matthias dietrich for numerous discussions on the properties of high - redshift quasars and comments and suggestions on the manuscript .",
    "this research has made use of the nasa / ipac extra - galactic database ( ned ) which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , caltech , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration .",
