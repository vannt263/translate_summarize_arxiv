    "the problem of discriminating between two different quantum states reveals two main features that make quantum theory so much different from the classical intuition .",
    "first , quantum state discrimination involves _ in - principle _ indistinguishability of quantum states : it is well known that it is not possible to perfectly infer ( by means of a one - shot experiment ) which state we eventually picked at random from a set of non orthogonal quantum states .",
    "of course , it is nonetheless possible to perform such a decision in an optimal way , e.  g. , by minimizing the error probability of discrimination  @xcite , by a minimax strategy where the smallest of the probabilities of correct detection is maximized  @xcite , or looking for optimal unambiguous discrimination  @xcite , where unambiguity is paid by the possibility of getting inconclusive results from the measurement .",
    "second , quantum indistinguishability principle is closely related to another very popular  yet often misunderstood  principle ( formerly known as heisenberg principle  @xcite ) : it is not possible to extract information from a quantum system without perturbing it somehow .",
    "in fact , if the experimenter could gather information about an unknown quantum state without disturbing it at all , even if such information is partial , by performing further non - disturbing measurements on the same system , he could finally determine the state , in contradiction with the indistinguishability principle  @xcite .",
    "actually , there exists a precise tradeoff between the amount of information extracted from a quantum measurement and the amount of disturbance caused on the system , analogous to heisenberg relations holding in the preparation procedure of a quantum state .",
    "quantitative derivations of such a tradeoff have been obtained in the scenario of quantum state estimation @xcite .",
    "the optimal tradeoff has been derived in the following cases : in estimating a single copy of an unknown pure state @xcite , many copies of identically prepared pure qubits @xcite and qudits @xcite , a single copy of a pure state generated by independent phase - shifts @xcite , an unknown maximally entangled state @xcite , an unknown coherent state @xcite and gaussian state @xcite .",
    "experiment realization of minimal disturbance measurements has been also reported @xcite .",
    "the present paper aims at fully characterize such a tradeoff relation in quantum state discrimination , in the case in which the unknown quantum state is chosen with equal _ a priori _ probability from a set of two non orthogonal pure states , and the error probability of the discrimination is allowed to be suboptimal ( thus intuitively causing less disturbance with respect to the optimal discrimination ) .",
    "we explicitly provide a measuring strategy  both in terms of outcome probabilities and state - reduction  that achieves the optimal tradeoff , which smoothly interpolates between the two limiting cases of maximal information extraction and no measurement at all . as a byproduct",
    ", we also recover in a simpler way some of the results of ref .",
    "our explicit derivation of the quantum measurement should allow to carry out a feasibility study for the experimental realization of minimal - disturbing measurements .",
    "the issue of the information - disturbance tradeoff for state discrimination can become of practical relevance for posing general limits in information eavesdropping and for analyzing security of quantum cryptographic communications .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly review the problem of minimum - error state discrimination , and obtain the minimum disturbance for the minimum - error measurement . in sec .",
    "iii , we provide the general solution of the optimal information - disturbance tradeoff , along with the corresponding measurement instrument . in sec .",
    "iv , we suggest an experimental realization of the minimum - disturbing measurement and conclude the paper with closing remarks .",
    "typically , in quantum state discrimination we are given two ( fixed ) non orthogonal pure states @xmath0 and @xmath1 , with _ a priori _ probabilities @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and we want to construct a measurement discriminating between the two . in the following , in order to work in full generality , we will describe a measurement by means of the _ quantum instruments _",
    "formalism  @xcite , namely , a collection of completely positive maps @xmath4 , labelled by the measurement outcomes @xmath5 . by exploiting the well known kraus decomposition  @xcite , one can always write @xmath6 . in the case",
    "the sum comprises just one term , namely , @xmath7 , the map @xmath8 is called _ pure _ , since it maps pure states into pure states .",
    "the trace @xmath9=\\tr[\\pi_i\\rho]$ ] , where @xmath10 is a positive operator associated to the @xmath11-th outcome , provides the probability that the measurement performed on a quantum system described by the density matrix @xmath12 gives the @xmath11-th outcome .",
    "the posterior ( or reduced ) state after the measurement is given by @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "the averaged reduced state  coming from ignoring the measurement outcome  is simply obtained using the _ trace - preserving _",
    "map @xmath14 .",
    "the trace - preservation constraint for @xmath15 implies that the set of positive operators @xmath16 is actually a positive operator - valued measure ( povm ) , satisfying the completeness condition @xmath17 .",
    "quantum state discrimination is then performed by a two - outcome instrument @xmath18 whose capability of discriminating between @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be evaluated by the average success probability @xmath19\\\\    & = \\sum_{i=1}^2p_i\\tr[\\pi_i|\\psi_i\\>\\<\\psi_i| ] .",
    "\\end{split}\\ ] ] notice that @xmath20 actually depends only on the povm @xmath16 .",
    "the probability @xmath20 quantifies the amount of information that the instrument @xmath18 is able to extract from the ensemble @xmath21 . among all instruments achieving average success probability @xmath22",
    "( the bar over @xmath20 means that we fix the value of @xmath20 ) , we are interested in those minimizing the average disturbance caused on the unknown state , that we evaluate in terms of average fidelity , namely , @xmath23 differently from @xmath20 , the disturbance @xmath24 strongly depends on the particular form of the instrument @xmath4 .",
    "this means that there exist many different instruments achieving the same @xmath20 , but giving different values of @xmath24 .",
    "let @xmath25 be the disturbance produced by the _",
    "least disturbing _ instrument that discriminates @xmath0 from @xmath1 with average success probability @xmath22 .",
    "intuitive arguments suggest that the larger is @xmath22 , the larger must correspondingly be @xmath26 ( i.  e. , the larger is the amount of information extracted , the larger is the disturbance caused by the measurement ) .",
    "our aim is to quantitatively derive such a tradeoff , along with the corresponding measurement instrument . from now on we will restrict to the case of equal _ a priori _ probabilities , i.  e. @xmath27 .",
    "let us start reviewing the case of the measurement maximizing @xmath20 .",
    "first of all notice that , given two generally non orthogonal pure states @xmath0 and @xmath1 , it is always possible to choose an orthonormal basis @xmath28 , placed symmetrically around @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : quadrante ] ) , on which both states have real components , namely @xmath29 and fidelity @xmath30 . in this case , it is known  @xcite that the maximum achievable @xmath20 is @xmath31 which is obtained by the orthogonal von neumann measurement @xmath32 .    which is the instrument , among all instruments achieving @xmath33 , that minimizes the disturbance @xmath24 ?",
    "let us assume for the moment ( the optimality of this assumption will be proved in full generality in the second part of the paper ) that such an instrument is pure .",
    "intuitively , this means that we are excluding a classical shuffling of outcomes .",
    "then , since @xmath33 is reached by a rank - one von neumann measurement , we can write @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a unitary operator . letting @xmath36 , one recognizes in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ui ] ) a measure - and - prepare realization : the observable @xmath37 is measured and , depending on the outcome , the quantum state @xmath38 is prepared , i.  e. one has @xmath39 $ ] . by symmetry arguments ( under the label exchange `` @xmath40 ''",
    "@xmath41 `` @xmath42 '' ) , @xmath43 , namely , the @xmath38 s are symmetrically tilted with respect to the @xmath44 s , see fig .",
    "[ fig : quadrante ] . with this notation , @xmath24 can be rewritten as @xmath45 since @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and , for @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 , minimizing the disturbance  ( [ eq : opt - dist - to - min ] ) resorts to minimizing the following function @xmath51 of the tilt @xmath52 @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a parameter , fixed along with the input states . solving the equation @xmath55",
    ", it turns out that the tilt @xmath52 minimizing the disturbance is related to the angle @xmath54 by @xmath56 in agreement with ref .  @xcite . from the above equation , @xmath57 .",
    "the presence of the tilt @xmath52 can be geometrically explained starting from the observation that , for non orthogonal states , minimum error discrimination can never be error - free .",
    "in other words , even using the optimal helstrom s measurement , there is always a non zero error probability , and , the closer the input states are to each other , the smaller the success probability is .",
    "hence it is reasonable that , the closer the input states are , the less `` trustworthy '' the measurement outcome is , and the average disturbance is minimized by cautiously preparing a new state that actually is a coherent superpositions of both hypotheses @xmath0 and @xmath1 . using eq .",
    "( [ eq : tilt ] ) , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : max - disturbance ] ) one obtains the minimum disturbance for helstrom s optimal measurement @xmath58 notice that @xmath59 reaches its maximum for @xmath60 , namely , when @xmath0 and @xmath1 are `` unbiased '' with respect to each other ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "we analysed the limiting case in which the information extraction is maximized ",
    "e. the average success probability is maximized .",
    "the opposite limiting case is when we do not perform any measurement at all , without disturbing the states .",
    "the main result of the paper is to provide the optimal tradeoff for all intermediate situations , along with the corresponding quantum instrument . in order to do this , it is useful to exploit the choi - jamiokowski isomorphism  @xcite between _ completely positive _ maps @xmath62 on states on @xmath63 and _ positive _ operators @xmath64 on @xmath65 @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the ( non normalized ) maximally entangled vector in the @xmath68-dimensional hilbert space @xmath65 ( in our case",
    ", @xmath69 is two - dimensional ) .",

    "trace - preservation condition is given by @xmath74=\\openone$ ] .",
    "an instrument @xmath18 can then be put in correspondence with a set of positive operators @xmath75 .",

    "( in the following , we will drop the star , since @xmath0 and @xmath1 have real components over the basis @xmath28 . )",
    "our strategy is to fix the average success probability @xmath82 by fixing the value of a control parameter @xmath83 , i.  e. @xmath84 with @xmath85 , and then to search , among all possible measurements achieving @xmath86 , for the one minimizing the disturbance @xmath87 . in the symmetric case , @xmath27 ,",
    "the minimization problem can be strikingly simplified by exploiting the exchange symmetry @xmath88 , where @xmath89 , in the @xmath28 basis .",

    "hence , without loss of generality , we can restrict ourselves to instruments satisfying @xmath92 .",
    "then , the average disturbance ( [ 14 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath93 $ ] , where @xmath94 , and the optimization problem  ( [ eq : hard - min ] ) over a two - outcome instrument resorts to the following  much simpler  optimization over a _",

    "( [ eq : ui ] ) , thus proving that assuming pure instruments is in fact _ the _ optimal choice .",
    "in particular , eq .",
    "( [ eq : tilt - t ] ) provides the tilt given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tilt ] ) . however , the crucial difference between helstrom s limit ( @xmath111 ) and the intermediate cases is that , for @xmath112 , the optimal instrument _ can not _ be interpreted by means of a measure - and - prepare scheme , and the unitaries @xmath105 and @xmath113 in eq .",

    "[ fig : tradeoff ] , for three different values of @xmath117 , i.e. @xmath118 .",
    "the expression of @xmath114 is rather involved , however it can be simplified upon introducing the renormalized quantities @xmath119 and @xmath120 as follows @xmath121 where @xmath33 and @xmath59 are given in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : helstrom ] ) and ( [ eq : disturbance_a ] ) , respectively . clearly , one has @xmath122 .",

    "@xcite without any assumption : the optimal tradeoff between the amount of information @xmath123 retrieved from the measurement and the disturbance @xmath124 caused on the state is given by @xmath125 for an optimal instrument , equality ( [ 28 ] ) holds for any value of @xmath126 , whereas for any suboptimal instrument the l.h.s is strictly larger than the r.h.s .",
    "in conclusion , a tight bound between the probability of discriminating two pure quantum states and the degree the initial state has to be changed by a quantum measurement has been derived .",
    "such a bound can be achieved by a noisy measurement instrument , where the noise continuously controls the tradeoff between the information retrieved by the measurement and the disturbance on the original state .",
    "more precisely , the optimal povm is given by the convex combination of the minimum - error povm and the completely uninformative one , whereas the measurement instrument is given by the coherent superposition of the minimum - disturbing instrument for the optimal discrimination and the identity map .",
    "we finally suggest two possible experimental realizations of the minimum - disturbing measurement , whose details will be published elsewhere  @xcite . since we are interested not only in the success probability but also in the posterior state of the system _ after _ the measurement , we have to focus on a possible indirect measurement scheme , in which the system is made interact with a probe , in such a way they get entangled .",

    ", @xmath111 identifies a _ completely entangling _ interaction , or , in other words , a situation in which a measurement on the probe gives the largest amount of information about the system , consequently causing the largest disturbance .",
