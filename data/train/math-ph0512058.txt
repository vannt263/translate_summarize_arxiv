    "a simple model of a josephson junction @xcite proposed by stewart and mccumber @xcite is based , from the mathematical point of view , on the non - linear second order ode @xmath2 here @xmath3 is the unknown function ( called _ phase _ ) representing the difference of phases of the so called order parameter which plays the role of the macroscopic wave function describing the states of two weakly coupled superconducting electrodes constituting josephson junction .",
    "the connection of the phase with observable quantities is established by the josephson equation @xcite which connects the voltage across the junction with the time derivative of @xmath4 : @xmath5 here the physical constant @xmath6 ( @xmath7 is the plank constant , @xmath8 is the electron charge ) is called the ( magnetic ) flux quantum , the parameter @xmath9 used in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) is the rescaled dimensionless time @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the ` genuine ' ( dimensional ) time , the constant @xmath12 called characteristic frequency is connected with junction properties .",
    "it can be defined by the equation @xmath13 , where @xmath14 are the junction characteristics , namely , @xmath15 is its resistance in the normal state , @xmath16 is called critical current ( it estimates the maximal current which can flow through the junction without application of external voltage ) .",
    "the positive constant @xmath17 is connected with the junction capacitance , the less the latter , the less the former .",
    "the function @xmath18 represents the current ( normalized to @xmath16 and named _ bias _ ) circulating in the junction circuit and supplied by an external source .",
    "it is assumed to be specified in advance .",
    "here we consider the case of a periodic bias of the known period @xmath19 and arbitrary profile . thus @xmath1 is assumed to satisfy the condition",
    "@xmath20 usually @xmath1 is a continuous ( or smooth ) function but a finite number of finite jumps on the period interval is also allowed - like pulses , the problem retains meaningful but such a generalization will not be pursued here . ] .",
    "it is worth noting that there is a common practice in the physical literature to divide the periodic bias function @xmath1 into some constant constituent ( ` direct current ' , dc ) @xmath21 and the residual one @xmath22 ( alternating , high frequency , rf current , ac ) : @xmath23 following this convention , we assume for definiteness that the average value of @xmath1 is assigned to @xmath21 .",
    "accordingly , by definition , the average value of the residual @xmath22 vanishes . and considers @xmath21 as a free parameter to be varied .",
    "in particular , the current - voltage ( i - v ) curve of a josephson junction is understood just as the dependence of the average voltage across it on the dc bias contribution @xmath21 whereas @xmath22 is kept unchanged . ]",
    "the important property of a josephson junction , which is perfectly captured by the stewart - mccumber model in spite of its comparative homeliness , is the _ phase - locking _ effect .",
    "qualitatively , the phase - locking may be regarded as the relaxation in the course of the phase evolution of the ` loose constituent ' of the phase function reflecting its initial state .",
    "then the only surviving dynamical ` process ' proves a steady one ` dragged ' by the periodic bias and not depending of the past phase evolution .",
    "said another way , once some lapse depending on the specific rate of relaxation of initial perturbations and the ` magnitude ' of the latter elapses , the phase function profile proceeds with the _ reproducing itself _ , modulo a @xmath24-aliquot contribution , on each subsequent time step of duration @xmath19 . obviously , such a situation would take place , in particular , if , regardless of the initial state the phase starts to evolve from , @xmath25 converges for large @xmath9 to a periodic function of the period @xmath19 .",
    "there are also other , non - periodic ( but still fairly specific as we shall see below ) forms of such an asymptotically ` steady ' phase evolution . on the other hand ,",
    "the phase - locking property is in no way a universal one to be automatically attributed to solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) . depending on the model parameters",
    ", the phase evolution may be completely different , revealing , in particular , no periodicity or any other apparent order @xcite .",

    "the specific parameter value is @xmath28 the values of other parameters are given in the main text . in order to visually resolve the neighbor graphs here ( and in subsequent similar plots ) all the curves , except for a starting one , are uniformly shifted in the ` vertical ' direction by an additional amount of space which is uniformly incremented for each subsequent graph curve ( here by 0.04 units ) . as one can see , the third ( green ) graph segment already coincides with the second one , essentially , yielding therefore the ( approximate ) specimen of the limiting phase evolution function which proves here periodic . ]    the plots shown in figure [ f1 ] illustrates the simplest case of the phase - locking in a numerical example . here",
    "the result of a straightforward numerical integration of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) is displayed .",
    "for the sake of definiteness , the bias function @xmath29 is chosen to be the periodic rectangular pulse sequence , one of the pulses being shown in the inset .",
    "its integral magnitude amounts to 1.5 , the frequency is @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) , @xmath32 , the width of the pulse peak ( here being rather a plateau symmetric with respect to the plot center ) amounts to 20% of the total pulse period .",
    "the ` constant bias constituent ' @xmath21 ( the average of @xmath1 ) equals @xmath33 .    the phase evolution displayed in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] starts with the null initial conditions @xmath34 chosen for simplicity reasons .",
    "is not the most natural choice since it would lead to the ill posedness of the cauchy problem in the limiting case of small @xmath17 . ]",
    "the figure displays the phase evolution during _ 3 sequential steps _ of variation of @xmath9 , each of duration @xmath19 .",
    "the graph of the first period phase evolution is of red color .",
    "the second period plot graph ( @xmath35 $ ] ) is brown . to be placed over the same @xmath9-axes segment as the first graph , it _ is shifted to the left _",
    "( ` backwards in time ' ) just by @xmath19 .",
    "similarly , the graph of the phase function over the third period time step ( @xmath36 $ ] , the green curve ) is shifted to the left by @xmath37 that places it over the same @xmath9-axes segment @xmath27 $ ] . as a result",
    ", all the three subsequent portions of the phase evolution graph are displayed over the common segment of the @xmath9-axes becoming more eligible for a visual collation and the monitoring of the @xmath19-scale periodicity .",
    "in passing , it is worth emphasizing that due to periodicity of @xmath1 the functions resulted from the above ` translations ' by means of the @xmath9-shifts aliquot @xmath19 _ retain to verify _ eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "thus , applying such a trick , the ` contiguous ' phase function representing the phase evolution over some time interval , perhaps semi - infinite , can be equally well represented by the sequence of phase functions ( solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) ) each defined on the finite interval @xmath27 $ ] .",
    "besides , for the better clarity , some additional artificial uniformly incrementing _ vertical shifts _ are applied to separate graph segments in fig .  [ f1 ] .",
    "the point is that we would like to recognize the limiting curve to which the sequence of the displayed ones converges , and the details of such a conversion , provided it takes place .",
    "obviously , it is reasonable to add some uniformly incremented vertical space to the vertical positions of separate graph segments in order to visually distinguish the far mutually close curves which otherwise would be seen in the plot overlaid in a messy way .",
    "specifically , in the case of fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , the vertical shifts amounting to additional 0.04 units per each subsequent graph segment are applied .",
    "this allows one to visually distinguish the second ( brown ) and the third ( green ) phase graph segments showing simultaneously that the corresponding functions are very close . in subsequent similar plots",
    ", the benefit of the trick will be ever more clear .",
    "it turns out that under the conditions assumed , the phase function on the third time step ( the third period ) apparently coincides with the one on the second step and thus already represents , with accuracy characteristic for the plot resolution , the desirable limiting ( asymptotic ) phase time dependence .",
    "the @xmath19-scale convergence proves here extremely fast .",
    "it is also obvious that in view of the convergence of subsequent graph segments to the common limiting curve the values of @xmath4 on the left and right graph boundaries of its domain coincide , making evidence of the periodicity of the limiting solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) we deal with .",
    "it is also of interest to consider the graphs of the corresponding _ voltage _ which coincides , up to the constant factor as it is defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) the ` voltage function ' @xmath38 .",
    "the plots of @xmath38 will be referred to below as @xmath39 plots _ in arbitrary units_. ] , with the derivatives of the functions displayed in fig .",
    "these are shown in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , the vertical and horizontal shifts ( the part of _ the plot segmenting _ trick ) similar to ones in fig .  [ f1 ] being applied .",
    "the voltage functions also rapidly converge to a periodic limiting one .    .",
    "in order to resolve the convergent series of graphs , the graphs except of the starting one are uniformly shifted in the ` vertical ' direction , the trick similar to one applied in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] . ]",
    "it has to be noted that the phase - locking does not necessarily claim for the asymptotic phase function @xmath25 to be periodic .",
    "indeed , keeping in mind the physical aspect of the problem , the actually registered voltage across josephson junction is not momentary but is efficiently averaged over many bias periods @xmath19 . for the sake of simplicity , let us consider the result of the voltage averaging over a _ single period _",
    "( the shortest time interval making sense in the situation under consideration ) , treating the averaging as the plain integrating followed by the division by the length of the integration interval . then in accordance with eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) the averaging started at the moment @xmath9 has to yield @xmath40                                            \\label{volt}\\ ] ] with @xmath41 ( the proportionality relation means here the dropping out of a dimensional universal constant ) .",
    "thus the ( asymptotic ) periodicity of @xmath4 means @xmath42 implying that no average voltage across the junction is observed bias current flows through the junction but the [ averaged ] voltage across it is zero . ] .",
    "however , instead of @xmath1 periodicity , one may also assume that the increment of @xmath4 across the time step of duration @xmath19 is independent on the moment @xmath43 when the averaging starts : @xmath44 , asymptotically ( for large but otherwise arbitrary @xmath9 ) .",
    "this constant may not be arbitrary .",
    "the condition above is consistent with eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) if , asymptotically , @xmath45 where @xmath46 is some integer , positive , negative , or zero .",
    "this number is named the _ phase - locking order_. evidently , the periodic phase function is the particular case corresponding to the zero order . allowing arbitrary integer @xmath46 ,",
    "the average voltage proves quantized assuming , in principle , any of discrete uniformly distributed values .",
    "is a _ rational _ number , provided the averaging is carried out over sufficiently large number of periods . ]",
    "numerical integration of eq .",
    "( [ f1 ] ) allows one to easily confirm the feasibility of non - zero - order phase - locking phase functions .",
    "in particular , fig .",
    "[ f3 ] displays the example of _ first order _ phase - locking . here",
    "the only difference in the parameter setup with the zero order case ( figures [ f1 ] , [ f2 ] ) is the value of the parameter @xmath21 now amounting to 1.1 .",
    "the limiting phase function is here _ not _ periodic but its increments on the time steps of duration @xmath19 apparently tends to @xmath24 . on the other hand ,",
    "subtracting the linearly growing contribution which insures this secular phase incrementing , a periodic function is leaved .    , [ f2 ] , except for @xmath47 .",
    "the color of subsequent phase function segments uniformly varies from red to green .",
    "the uniformly incremented shifts in the ` vertical ' direction are applied including the first order phase - locking responsible contribution @xmath48 for the phase ( @xmath48 + 0.2 units for the top panel and 0.2 units for the lower one per subsequent graph segment , respectively ) . ]",
    "similarly , the further increasing of @xmath21 yields the second order phase - locking phase evolution .",
    "it is displayed in fig .",
    "here @xmath49 , the other parameters being kept unchanged . increasing @xmath21 , the larger order",
    "phase - locking phase functions can be produced as well .",

    "it is seen that in the cases of higher order phase - locking , the convergence of the sequence of segmented phase functions to the common limiting function is slower .",

    "it suffices to set up @xmath53 to lose the apparent convergence to any steady asymptotic state at all .",
    "the corresponding apparently non - convergent segmented phase and voltage function plots are shown in fig .",
    "these reveal no tendency to converge to any limiting curves demonstrating ` irregular ' ( or even apparently ` chaotic ' , as far as one concerns the variations on the scale @xmath19 ) behavior .",

    "the uniformly incremented shifts in the ` vertical ' direction ( @xmath54 units for the phase and 0.2 units for the voltage functions per subsequent graph segment , respectively ) are applied . ]",
    "it is worth mentioning that the convergence  or the divergence  of the sequence of phase functions describing a single long - term phase evolution is often difficult to reliably establish by means of straightforward numerical integrating of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "indeed , the slower such a sequence converges , the longer fragment of the phase evolution has to be analyzed .",
    "accordingly , approaching the hypothetical boundary of the area in the space of the bias functions where the evolution of the phase leads to a steady state ( _ phase - locking area _ in the parameter space ) , one inevitably encounters with insufficiency of the available computational resources .",
    "the very boundary , where the convergence reverses to the divergence , is not detectable in this way .",
    "besides , in view of the obscurity of the corresponding time scale , the ` strong ' phase divergence ( more exactly , the absence of convergence to any asymptotic steady state ) is even harder to detect through the apparent behavior of numerically generated phase function than the too slow convergence .    the formulation and substantiation of the method allowing one to efficiently distinguish the phase - locking property in the important particular case of ` overdamped ' version of equation ( [ eq1 ] ) is the main theme of the present discussion .",
