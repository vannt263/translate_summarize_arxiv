    "changes of the hadron masses are indications of the chiral symmetry restoration occurring in hot and/or dense qcd  @xcite .",
    "dropping masses of hadrons following the brown - rho ( br ) scaling  @xcite can be one of the most prominent candidates of the strong signal of the melting of the quark condensate @xmath1 which is the order parameter of the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking . especially , the dropping of the @xmath2 meson mass according to the br scaling satisfactorily explained  @xcite the enhancement of dielectron mass spectra below the @xmath3 resonance observed at cern sps  @xcite .    the vector manifestation ( vm )  @xcite is the wigner realization in which the @xmath2 meson becomes massless degenerate with the pion at the chiral phase transition point .",
    "the vm is formulated in the effective field theory ( eft ) based on the hidden local symmetry ( hls )  @xcite . in the hls theory",
    "we can perform the systematic chiral perturbation with the dynamical @xmath2 meson included  @xcite . furthermore , the matching to qcd ^^ a la wilson combined with the renormalization group equations ( rges ) gives several physical predictions in remarkable agreement with experiments  @xcite .",
    "the formulation of the vm was done also in hot matter  @xcite and in dense matter  @xcite , and a compelling evidence of dropping mass recently comes from the mass shift of the @xmath4 meson in nuclei measured by the kek - ps e325 experiment  @xcite and the cbelsa / taps collaboration  @xcite and also from that of the @xmath2 meson observed in the star experiment  @xcite .",
    "since the vm formulated in the hls theory provides a theoretical description of the dropping @xmath2 mass which is protected by the existence of the fixed point ( vm fixed point ) , we can study several other phenomena associated with the dropping @xmath2 by expanding the hls theory around the vm fixed point : large violation of the vector dominance of the pion electromagnetic form factor should occur near the vm fixed point  @xcite , which plays an important role  @xcite to explain the recent experimental data provided by na60  @xcite ; the pion velocity near the restoration point is predicted as @xmath5-@xmath6  @xcite , which seems to be consistent with value extracted  @xcite from the recent data from the star collaboration at rhic  @xcite .    in the vm , it was assumed that the axial - vector and scalar mesons are decoupled from the theory near the phase transition point .",
    "however , the masses of these mesons may decrease following the br scaling . actually , recently in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was proposed to extend the vm to include axial - vector mesons for explaining the anomalous @xmath7 ratio measured in peripheral collisions by star  @xcite .",
    "there were several analyses with models including axial - vector mesons such as in ref .",
    "these analyses are not based on the fixed point structure and found no significant reduction of the masses of axial - vector meson . then , it is desirable to construct an eft which includes the axial - vector meson as a dynamical degree of freedom , and study whether a fixed point structure exists and it can realize the light axial - vector meson .",
    "there are several models which includes the axial - vector meson in addition to the pion and vector meson consistently with the chiral symmetry of qcd such as the `` massive yang - mills '' field method  @xcite , the anti - symmetric tensor field method  @xcite and the model based on the generalized hidden local symmetry ( ghls )  @xcite .",
    "these models are equivalent  @xcite at least tree - level on - shell amplitude is concerned . however , there are differences in the off - shell amplitude since the definitions of the off - shell fields are different in the models ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . here",
    "we pick up the model based on the ghls which is a natural extension of the hls to include the axial - vector meson .    in this paper",
    ", we first develop the chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) with ghls , in which a systematic low - energy expansion is possible even including the axial - vector meson in addition to the pseudoscalar and vector mesons as a dynamical degree of freedom .",
    "then , we make the matching of the vector and axial - vector current correlators with those obtained by the operator product expansion ( ope ) in the energy region higher than the axial - vector meson mass to find that the resultant set of the parameter relations satisfies the pole saturated forms of the first and second weinberg sum rules .",
    "based on the rges in the wilsonian sense obtained in the chpt with ghls , the set of the parameter relations is shown to be stable against the renormalization group evolution .",
    "we further study the fate of the axial - vector meson near the chiral restoration point , and found that the weinberg sum rules together with the matching necessarily leads to the dropping masses of both vector and axial - vector mesons .",
    "interestingly , the ratio of masses of vector and axial - vector mesons as well as the mixing between the pseudoscalar and axial - vector mesons flows into one of three fixed points : they exhibit the vm  like , ginzburg - landau  like and hybrid  like patterns of the chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "this paper is organized as follows :    in section  [ sec : ghls ] , we give a brief review on the ghls .",
    "construction of the chpt with ghls is done in section  [ sec : chpt ] . in section  [ sec : wsr ] , we make the matching to derive a set of parameter relations satisfying the pole saturated forms of the first and second weinberg sum rules .",
    "this is shown to be stable against the renormalization group evolution .",
    "section  [ sec : ps ] is devoted to study the phase structure of the ghls with the weinberg sum rules kept satisfied . we show that both @xmath2 and @xmath0 necessarily become massless at the phase transition point , and that the mass ratio flows into one of three fixed points . in section  [ sec : crm ] , we discuss the relation of three classes of the fixed point to the chiral representation mixing . finally in section  [ sec : sd ] , we give a brief summary and discussions .",

    "<S> we study the chiral symmetry restoration using the generalized hidden local symmetry ( ghls ) which incorporates the rho and @xmath0 mesons as the gauge bosons of the ghls and the pion as the nambu - goldstone boson consistently with the chiral symmetry of qcd . </S>",
    "<S> we show that a set of parameter relations , which ensures the first and second weinberg sum rules , is invariant under the renormalization group evolution . </S>",
    "<S> then , we found that the weinberg sum rules together with the matching of the vector and axial - vector current correlators inevitably leads to _ the dropping masses of both rho and @xmath0 mesons _ at the symmetry restoration point , and that the mass ratio as well as the mixing angle between the pion and @xmath0 meson flows into one of three fixed points . </S>"
