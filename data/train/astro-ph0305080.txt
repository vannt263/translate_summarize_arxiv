    "while a mass term is allowed in the generalized model of olive and pospelov  @xcite , it is neglected for the explicit solution given there in eq .",

    "the initial condition for @xmath56 is irrelevant in the linearized theory   since @xmath109 only depends on changes in @xmath56 ; the value of @xmath105 becomes important only if the scalar potential can not be neglected .",
    "it is plausible though that @xmath110 in the early radiation era , since @xmath86 may have a deep minimum at @xmath27 during inflation in the very early universe , which later , after one or more phase transitions , becomes shallow with @xmath111 .",
    "for example , in the primordial inflationary stage , @xmath112 may be on the order of @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is the hubble parameter during primordial inflation .",
    "while the scale factor @xmath60 inflates by 60 or more e - foldings , @xmath24 will in this scenario rapidly approach @xmath27 . we therefore take @xmath115 in the early radiation era .",
