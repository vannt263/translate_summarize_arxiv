    "the dynamics of a particle surmounting a barrier is an important and interesting problem in chemistry and physics . in chemistry ,",
    "chemical reactions are most common examples where one studies the dynamics of barrier crossing along a suitably defined reaction coordinate . while in physics nucleation phenomena , electrical transport etc .",
    "involve barrier crossing . a review by hnggi , talkner and borkovec @xcite gives a comprehensive account on the subject of barrier crossing .",
    "the simplest possible approach to calculate the rate constant for such processes is given by transition state theory @xcite .",
    "as the simplest version of the problem one can describe the rate process along a single reaction co - ordinate",
    ". then the one dimensional version of the transition state rate constant @xmath2 reads as , @xmath3 $ ] , where @xmath4 is the angular frequency in the reactant well and @xmath5 is the barrier height or the activation energy .",
    "the derivation of transition state rate constant is based on two assumptions .",
    "firstly an overall thermal equilibrium is assumed and secondly frictional effect is not taken into account by incorporating what is known as  no recrossing \" assumption .",
    "subsequently , kramers @xcite theory takes into account of the friction in a phenomenological way .",
    "his formulation was based on markovian dynamics of a brownian particle escaping from a metastable state .",
    "further extensions of kramers s theory were carried out by grote and hynes @xcite followed by hnggi and mojtabi @xcite .",
    "they took into account of the non - markovian nature of the dynamics . another approach to calculate the rate constant is due to chandler @xcite known as the method of reactive flux in chemical physics literature . in this approach the thermal rate constant is written as a correlation function which is nothing but the ensemble average over infinite number of trajectories starting at the barrier top and ending on the product side at time @xmath6 .",
    "the rate constant at time @xmath6 is written as a product of the time dependent transmission coefficient @xmath7 and the transition state rate constant @xmath2 .",
    "thus one writes , @xmath8 . in the limit @xmath0 , @xmath9 and one obtains @xmath10 .",
    "here we follow the method of reactive flux to calculate the time dependent rate constant for a particle bilinearly coupled to a harmonic bath @xcite .",
    "the bilinear coupling allows us to get an analytical expression for the time dependent transmission coefficient .",
    "although the method of reactive flux and the hamiltonian we have used are well known in the literature , as far as our knowledge nobody has used such hamiltonian to calculate the time dependent transmission coefficient analytically .",
    "the calculation is of interest as the transmission coefficient for the overdamped limit of the model was obtained recently by simulation @xcite .",
    "our approach directly gives expression for the time dependent transmission coefficient in terms of the spectral density @xmath11 and not restricted to overdamped limit .",
    "a normal mode analysis of the coupled hamiltonian was made by pollak @xcite and others to analyze the kramers problem .",
    "here we point out that the approximation is very powerful and can be used to get the exact expression for @xmath7 .",
    "further we believe that it can also be used to get the quantum expression for @xmath12 .",
    "an exact calculation of @xmath7 using the phase space distribution function formulation was carried out in classical regime by kohen and tannor @xcite , bao @xcite , and more recently in the context of single enzyme kinetics by chowdhury and cherayil @xcite .",
    "also the calculation of the transmission coefficient in the quantum domain is carried out by ray s group @xcite .",
    "our analysis in terms of normal modes has the advantage that it makes the physical ideas very clear .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce our system plus harmonic bath hamiltonian and the generalized langevin equation ( gle ) . in section iii",
    "we mention the method of reactive flux and using our hamiltonian derive an analytical expression for the time dependent transmission coefficient , @xmath7 . section iv deals with the calculation of @xmath7 for markovian and non markovian dynamics .",
    "section v is conclusion .",
    "we consider a particle coupled to a harmonic bath @xcite with the total hamiltonian    @xmath13    here ( @xmath14 ) are the momenta and coordinates of the @xmath15th bath oscillator whose mass and frequency are @xmath16 respectively .",
    "( @xmath17 ) is the momentum and coordinate of the system .",
    "@xmath18 couples the bath oscillator to the system .",
    "now in terms of the mass weighted coordinates    @xmath19    our hamiltonian becomes    @xmath20    and then with this hamiltonian one can derive what is know as the generalized langevin equation ( gle ) which reads as    @xmath21    one can also write the time dependent friction in terms of the spectral density of the bath @xmath11 as follows    @xmath22    where    @xmath23    one can easily show that    @xmath24    we take the barrier top to be at @xmath25 and introduce @xmath26 . for small amplitude motion around the barrier top , one can use the normal modes , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is an orthogonal matrix such that @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 is diagonal .",
    "@xmath29 is a dynamical matrix given by    @xmath31    the reaction co - ordinate @xmath32 may then be written as @xmath33    of the modes @xmath34 , we take @xmath35 to be the unstable mode . we denote the frequency of @xmath34 as @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath35 has the imaginary frequency and we write it as @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is real . as @xmath34 is a normal mode , its time development is given by @xmath39 with @xmath40 .",
    "now the hamiltonian when written in terms of the normal modes the coupling is no more there and is given by    @xmath41    in the next section we analytically derive the rate constant in the normal mode description using the above hamiltonian .",
    "in this section we briefly describe the method of reactive flux @xcite to calculate the rate constant .",
    "the method of reactive flux expresses the thermal rate constant ( written in the mass - weighted coordinates ) as    @xmath42    where the angular bracket indicates the thermal average over the system as well as the bath degrees of freedom .",
    "the top of the barrier is chosen as @xmath43 .",
    "@xmath44 is 1 if @xmath45 and @xmath46 otherwise .",
    "@xmath47 is just 1-@xmath48 , @xmath49 is the velocity of the particle .    the numerator of eq .",
    "( [ rateconstant2 ] ) could be written as    @xmath50    expressing the step function as an integral over delta function and using the fourier integral representation of delta function the expression for @xmath51 becomes    @xmath52    the angular bracket indicates the thermal average over all degrees of freedom of the problem and it is done by multiplying the quantities within the angular bracket by @xmath53 , and carrying out the integration over all coordinates and momenta degrees of freedom .",
    "writing @xmath51 in terms of @xmath34 leads to    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is the barrier height .",
    "after one carries out the integrations the expression for @xmath56 can be written as    @xmath57    similarly the denominator of the eq .",
    "( [ rateconstant2 ] ) can be written as    @xmath58    then the time dependent rate constant becomes    @xmath59    here we use the following identity @xcite , @xmath60 , and this simplifies our @xmath61    @xmath62    where , @xmath63 .",
    "as usual @xmath61 @xcite is defined by    @xmath64    we show in the appendix that @xmath65 , which is nothing but the transition state rate constant @xmath2 . in the appendix",
    "we also show how one gets kramers rate constant in the @xmath66 limit .    using the above expression for @xmath67 our time dependent transmission coefficient",
    ", @xmath68 becomes @xmath69    in the next section we calculate @xmath70 and from that @xmath7 for markovian as well as for non markovian noise .",
    "calculation of @xmath7 involves the calculation of @xmath70 .",
    "first we describe a general derivation of @xmath70 then we evaluate @xmath7 for different cases .",
    "@xmath70 is defined by @xmath71 .",
    "one proceeds by writing @xmath72 to evaluate @xmath73 here we adopt notations similar to quantum mechanics and also use the fact that @xmath74 is a matrix with eigen values @xmath75",
    "@xmath76    then by introducing @xmath77 in between the sum and using the resolution of identity @xmath78 @xmath79 .",
    "@xmath80    .    using partitioning technique",
    "one can evaluate @xmath81 to get @xmath82    then using the definition of @xmath83 eq.([power ] ) it becomes @xmath84    as @xmath85 @xmath86 we can write @xmath87      first we perform the calculation with the time dependent friction @xmath90 used by xie @xcite , which is    @xmath91    with , @xmath92 , thus the thermal fluctuations are described by fractional gaussian noise @xcite .",
    "now we take a inverse fourier transform of eq .",
    "( [ frictionpower ] ) and write @xmath11 in terms of @xmath93 .",
    "@xmath94    using the definition of @xmath90 we get    @xmath95    first we consider the case @xmath96 which means we consider the unstable mode of the problem . then    @xmath97    our next task is to find out the poles , i.e. the unstable modes for which @xmath98 blows up , i.e. the solutions of the equation @xmath99 on the other hand , to find @xmath100 we have to consider a situation where @xmath101 is positive .",
    "in other words the stable modes .",
    "now the evaluation of @xmath100 involves the integral @xmath102 . using the identity @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the principal value of @xmath105 we find    @xmath106    thus @xmath107 and    @xmath108      first we consider @xmath109 , for which the @xmath110 and with this the noise - noise correlation function defined in eq .",
    "( [ noisecorr1 ] ) becomes delta function correlated , reading @xmath111 then the dynamics is described by usual langevin equation rather than a gle .",
    "thus the dynamics is then markovian i.e. with no memory . for the markovian case eq .",
    "( [ eqlambda ] ) becomes , @xmath112 and has two roots .",
    "but only one of them is physically acceptable .",
    "the root is , @xmath113 .",
    "similarly from eq .",
    "( [ rhoomega ] ) one gets @xmath114 . then @xmath115 and @xmath116 are used to calculate @xmath117 and taking @xmath0 limit one gets @xmath118 . in this case",
    "we could do these analytically . the time dependent transmission coefficient in this case is given by    @xmath119    where @xmath120 .",
    "@xmath7 is then calculated using the above expression and plotted against time ( fig .",
    "when @xmath122 then the noise is no longer delta function correlated , i.e. not a white noise with gaussian distribution .",
    "this regime is know as non markovian regime which has memory .",
    "we have similarly evaluated @xmath7 for @xmath123 and plotted against time in fig .",
    "in this case the integrations are done numerically since analytical evaluation of integrals were not possible .      in this section",
    "we carry out the calculation of @xmath7 with a time dependent friction @xmath125 .",
    "the same friction is used by kohen and tannor @xcite .",
    "first we calculate @xmath11 with this friction as follows @xmath126    then the following integral is evaluated as follows    @xmath127    we have used the identity , @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is the principal value of @xmath130 . thus    @xmath131 and    @xmath132    one should notice that    @xmath133    thus in this limit the result obtained is identical with the friction @xmath134 with @xmath135 .",
    "in other words the markovian dynamics is recovered .    to calculate @xmath7 we proceed as in the previous case .    first considering the case @xmath96 , one gets @xmath136    thus    @xmath137    hence to find out the poles one has to solve the solution of the equation    @xmath138    to explore the non - markovian dynamics we choose three set of parameters corresponding to three different regimes of non - markovian dynamics following kohen and tannor @xcite .",
    "these regimes are called non - adiabatic , caging and intermediate according to kohen and tannor @xcite . the time dependent coefficients in these regimes are calculated numerically and plotted against time .",
    "we observe similar kind of oscillatory behavior of @xmath7 in the caging regime as obtained by them .",
    "similarly in the intermediate regime the plot looks similar with a nonmonotonic decay ( fig .",
    "the paper shows an elegant way of combining the traditional system plus reservoir model @xcite and the method of reactive flux @xcite to calculate the time dependent transmission coefficient , @xmath7 .",
    "analytically we derive a general formula for @xmath7 eq .",
    "( [ kappat ] ) . for the markovian case with no memory ( @xmath109 ) for the friction @xmath89 with @xmath109 which is same as with @xmath139 for the friction @xmath140 ,",
    "@xmath141 is calculated analytically .",
    "whereas in the case with memory ( @xmath142 ) and with any finite value of @xmath143 the calculations were done numerically . in all the cases a plot of @xmath7 vs @xmath6 starts from @xmath144 at @xmath145 and reaches a plateau in the long time limit .",
    "as expected our formula for the time dependent rate constant , @xmath61 becomes equal to the transition state rate constant when one takes the limit @xmath146 @xcite .",
    "similarly kramers rate constant is obtained by taking @xmath147 @xcite . in future",
