    "the symmetric plasmon mode gives rise to a dipole - like plasmon excitation , similar in nature to that of a single layer with an electron density given by adding the densities on the two layers . on the other hand",
    ", the antisymmetric plasmon mode leads to a quadruple - like excitation , which is able to store electric field energy between the two layers . in the presence of a current with drift velocity @xmath106 for electrons in one of the two electron - gas layers , the phase velocities of these two spatially separated plasmon modes",
    "are modified drastically due to the doppler shift as well as the surface plasmon on the substrate .",
    "consequently , two streams of quasiparticles with different phase velocities may be created from either the symmetric or antisymmetric mode , depending on the strength of the current , the separation between layers and their distances from the surface of the substrate .",
    "however , for freely suspended layers , the lower - energy antisymmetric plasmon mode becomes unstable whenever @xmath106 lies within the range @xmath114 , switching from a quadruple - like excitation to a dipole - like excitation .",
    "the instability for the plasmon mode has a finite lifetime because it grows after taking energy from the injected current and transferring it to the incident electromagnetic field .    from the point of view of momentum space",
    ", electrons may only occupy momentum space within the range of @xmath115 at zero temperature in a state of thermal equilibrium , where @xmath81 is the electron fermi wave number and @xmath116 is the fermi energy .",
    "when a current is passed through the electron gas , electrons are driven out from this state of thermal equilibrium and their population becomes asymmetrical with respect to @xmath117 . in this case , the fermi energy @xmath118 is split into @xmath119 and @xmath120 with @xmath121 , where @xmath122 represents the electron center - of - mass momentum . in this",
    "shifted fermi - dirac distribution model , electrons in such a non - equilibrium state are energetically unstable , and the higher - energy electrons in the range @xmath123 tend to relax to the lower - energy empty states in the range of @xmath124 by emitting electromagnetic waves and phonons to ensure total momentum and energy conservation .",
    "this process is known as radiation loss of plasmon excitations in the time domain , in addition to the usual absorption loss of plasmon excitations in the space domain due to nonzero imaginary part of the electron dielectric function .",
    "a surface grating must be employed in order to convert the energy of the unstable plasmon mode into a transverse radiation field in free space and at the same time suppress phonon emission ( heating ) .",
    "the growth rate @xmath125 $ ] of the plasmon mode is determined by the imaginary part of the plasmon frequency while the average plasmon growth rate ( per unit area ) is given by @xmath126 .",
    "in summary , we are proposing a spiler quantum plasmonic device which employs 2d layers in combination with a thick conducting material .",
    "we find that the spiler emits electromagnetic radiation when a current is passed through the 2d layer or the surface of the thick conducting material to make the plasmons become unstable at a specific frequency and wave number .",
    "it is possible to change the range of plasmon instability by selecting the properties of the nanosheet or frequency of the surface plasmon , i.e. , the substrate .",
    "the surface plasmon plays a crucial role in giving rise to the rabi splitting and the concomitant streams of quasiparticles whose phase velocities are in opposite directions when the instability takes place .",
    "the emitted electromagnetic radiation may be collected from regions on the surface that are convenient .",
    "finally , we note that in presenting our numerical results , we measured frequency in terms of the bulk plasmon frequency which , typically for heavily - doped semiconductors , we have @xmath127ev . either for intrinsic graphene , doped monolayer graphene or an inversion layer 2deg , we have @xmath128 m and @xmath129 m/s . in fig.[fig:2 ] , the unit of frequency is @xmath130 which is of the same order as @xmath73 .",
    "the current - driven asymmetric electron distribution in @xmath131 space leads to an induced polarization current or a `` dipole radiator '' .",
    "if two electron gas layers are placed close enough , the in - phase inter - layer coulomb interaction will give a dipole - like plasmon excitation , similar to that of a single layer .",
    "on the other hand , the out - of - phase layer coulomb coupling will lead to an unstable quadruple - like excitation .",
    "this unstable quadruple - like plasmon excitation can be effectively converted into a transverse electromagnetic field in free space if a surface grating is employed .",

    "let us first consider the case when a current is passed through a 2deg layer .",
    "this current creates a doppler shift in the response function @xmath132 .",

    "the energy dispersion for an electron in a 2deg is @xmath133 , where @xmath74 is the electron effective mass .",

    "after this wave vector replacement is carried out and a change of variables is made in the resulting integral , we simply obtain an expression for the polarization function which is exactly the same as that given in eq.([kempa ] ) , except with the frequency shifted by @xmath137 .",
