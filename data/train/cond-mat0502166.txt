    "more than a century ago , pareto had observed that the income distribution across several countries ( at least in the high - income range ) follows a power law @xcite , i.e. , the probability density function of income @xmath0 , @xmath1 , with the pareto exponent @xmath2 lying between 1 and 2 .",
    "pareto claimed that , in general , @xmath3 .",
    "the power - law nature was also found to be true of wealth distributions , albeit with a different exponent .",
    "the two distributions are not completely unrelated , as those who are significantly wealthy also have incomes far higher than the average individual or household .",
    "however , the distributions of income and wealth can not be simply connected , and each have to be measured independently for a particular society .",
    "the occurrence of a qualitatively similar distribution across widely differing geographical regions and economic development stages may be indicative of universal features of inequality in human societies .",
    "this has led to attempts at developing simple models for generating wealth distributions that are qualitatively similar to those empirically observed , with asset exchange interactions between agents @xcite . to verify such models further empirical measurements of wealth distribution in different economies",
    "is essential .",
    "very recently , there have been a large number of empirical studies of the income distribution of several countries , with income being defined as the flow of wages , dividends , interest payments , etc . over a period of time .",
    "this can usually be inferred from income tax returns .",
    "the general consensus , based on these studies , is that at the low - income range the income distribution obeys a log - normal @xcite or exponential @xcite distribution , while the high - income end shows power law behavior with widely differing pareto exponents , which are different both in different countries , as well as in different periods for the same country ( e.g. , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , not many studies have been done on the distribution of wealth , which consist of the net value of assets ( financial holdings and/or tangible items ) owned at a given point in time .",
    "the lack of an easily available data source for measuring wealth , analogous to income tax returns for measuring income , means that one has to resort to indirect methods .",
    "levy and solomon @xcite used a published list of wealthiest people to generate a rank - order distribution , from which they inferred the pareto exponent for wealth distribution in usa .",
    "follow - up studies used similar techniques to infer the exponents for uk , france and sweden @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite used an alternative technique based on adjusted data reported for the purpose of inheritance tax to obtain the pareto exponent for uk .",
    "another study used tangible asset ( namely house area ) as a measure of wealth to obtain the wealth distribution exponent in ancient egyptian society during the reign of akhenaten ( 14th century bc)@xcite .",
    "apart from the last mentioned study , all the other wealth distributions were for western highly - developed capitalist economies , and are thus of very similar societies . observing the wealth distribution of a non - western developing capitalist society , such as india , which",
    "until quite recently had a planned economy , will be not only instructive by itself but it will also provide necessary comparison with the previous studies .",
    "the general feature observed in the limited empirical study of wealth distribution is that of a power law behavior for the wealthiest 5 - 10 @xmath4 of the population , and exponential or log - normal distribution for the rest of the population .",
    "the pareto exponent as measured from the wealth distribution is found to be always lower than the exponent for the income distribution , which is consistent with the general observation that , in market economies , wealth is much more unequally distributed than income @xcite .    in the present paper , we have observed that the high wealth limit of the indian wealth distribution is consistent with a power law having an exponent that ranges from 0.81 ( 2002 ) to 0.92 ( 2004 ) . in the next section",
    "we describe the data sets used in our analysis . in the section containing results",
    "we have reported not only the power law behavior , but also how changes in wealth is related to ones net worth .",
    "data on labor income ( salaries ) at the top - income end is also analyzed and compared with the low- and middle - income distribution .",
    "we conclude with a discussion on the reliability of exponent measurements , possible reasons for obtaining multiple values of the pareto exponent for the same economy , and the connection with such low - resolution measure of inequality as the gini coefficient .",
    "the data for the 125 wealthiest individuals and households in india were obtained from a special report by the indian business magazine , _ business standard_@xcite .",
    "the wealths were reported at two dates , dec 31 , 2002 and aug 31 , 2003 , which allowed us to also study the change in wealth over the interval between these two dates .",
    "the list essentially comprised of indian billionaires ( in indian rupees ) as of aug 31 , 2003 . for comparison ,",
    "note that india had 61,000 millionaires in 2003 @xcite ; by contrast , usa had 2,270,000 millionaires .    the above data set also reported the gross salary of the 67 highest - paid executives in india ( which includes foreign nationals based in india ) .",
    "many , though by no means all , of those who figure in this list also belong to the previously mentioned list of wealthiest indians .",
    "it is therefore possible to infer a relation between labor income and wealth .",
    "we also used a recent list of 40 richest indians published by the international business magazine _ forbes _ in dec 10 , 2004 @xcite .",
    "the criterion used for this list was somewhat different from the _ business standard _ list in that an individual did not need to be residing in india to be listed , but need only have indian nationality .",
    "however , in practice , except for one case , all the others in the list are based in india .",
    "further , while in the previous list the wealth was calculated in indian rupees , in the forbes list it is given in terms of us dollars .",
    "however , as we are primarily interested in the slope of the rank - order distribution , this did not affect our results .",
    "we rejected the top @xmath5 of the data in the lists while fitting a power - law function to the distributions .",
    "this was to avoid erroneous calculation of the exponent due to the wealth of the richest few individuals being higher than the general trend , resembling the ` king effect ' seen in many other contexts , e.g. , the distribution of city sizes @xcite , popularity of musicians @xcite , movie gross earnings @xcite , etc .",
    "we also classified the wealths according to the industry sectors on which they were founded .",
    "the classification was adopted from the bombay stock exchange ( bse ) list of 20 industry sectors , ranging from information technology , pharmaceuticals , automotive , etc . which have a large representation in the list of wealthiest indians , to sectors such as , food & beverages , consumer durables , consumer non - durables , etc .",
    ", each of which have so few representatives in the sample , that 13 of them have been grouped together into an aggregation called ` others ' in our study .",
    "as pointed out in previous papers ( e.g. , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the exponent of a power - law probability distribution function can be determined with good accuracy from the slope of the corresponding rank - order plot on a double logarithmic scale . in particular ,",
    "if the wealth is distributed as @xmath6 , it can be shown that the wealth of the @xmath7-th ranked agent is distributed as @xmath8 @xcite . hence , obtaining the slope of the rank - order plot on a double logarithmic scale and inverting it , allows us to determine the pareto exponent .",
    "= 5.5 in    fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the rank distribution of wealth from the lists of richest indians described in the previous section .",
    "least square fit of the 2002 data yields a slope of -1.24 while the 2003 data has a slope of -1.23 , which give pareto exponents of 0.81 and 0.82 , respectively .",
    "note that , due to the arrangement of the data , we could use only 111 points from the 2002 data , while all 125 data points could be used for the 2003 data .",
    "the inset shows the 2004 data , which , upon least square fitting , gave a slope of -1.08 , from which we obtained a pareto exponent of 0.92 .",
    "goodness of fit was quantitatively measured to be @xmath9 = 0.989 ( 2002 ) , 0.984 ( 2003 ) , and 0.988 ( 2004 ) .",
    "= 5.5 in    fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the correlation of net worth of agents over an interval of 6 months between dec 31 , 2002 and aug 31 , 2003 .",
    "the points all fall in a narrow band , implying that there is no significant change in the wealth during this period .",
    "however , as all the fortunes being studied here are based on stock holdings , movement in share values affect the net worth of individuals ( and households ) in the list .",
    "fortunes based on information technology stocks show an uniform ( although small ) decline over the period studied , whereas those based on pharmaceuticals stocks show , in general , an increase .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "2 shows absolute changes in wealth over the period of 8 months as a function of the wealth at the beginning of the period .",
    "the data points are all clustered close together , and the linear correlation coefficient in a log - log scale is 0.95 , indicating that the wealth lost or gained by agents is proportional to their overall wealth .",
    "this is a characteristic of a multiplicative stochastic process , where the changes in the value of a variable are proportional to the value , rather than an additive process , where the changes are independent of the value ( e.g. , random walks ) .",
    "this lends support to the assumptions of asset exchange models for wealth distribution @xcite , according to which , the amount lost or gained by agents through each trading interaction is a random fraction of their wealth at a given instant .",
    "= 5.5 in    fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the labor income ( i.e. , salaries ) rank - order distribution for the highest paid company executives in india .",
    "least square fitting of the data ( rejecting the top 12.5 % of the data points ) in a double - logarithmic scale gives a slope of -0.66 , which indicates a pareto exponent @xmath10 for the higher - end tail of labor income distribution in india .",
    "note that , this is almost identical to what pareto had announced to be the value of the exponent based on his study of late-19th century european economies . to compare the high - income end of the distribution with the income of the rest of the population ,",
    "the two insets show the cumulative income distribution for lower - income indian households ( upper inset ) with data obtained from a 1997 survey available online @xcite , and the cumulative salary distribution for individuals ( lower inset ) , with experience of 10 years or more , working in the information technology industry , where the data is from a 2002 survey by the it industry magazine _ dataquest _ @xcite . the data , although of low resolution , is suggestive of a log - normal distribution in the low- to middle - income range .",
    "comparison between the overall income of poorer households and the salaries ( labor income ) of middle- to high - income individuals is valid , because the former comprises almost entirely of wages , and not any earnings from financial or other assets @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that it is this difference in the composition of the income between the low - income ( comprising solely labor income ) and high - income ( dominated by capital investment gains ) sections of the distribution that is responsible for the exponential nature of the former and power - law in the latter region @xcite .",
    "however , we observe power - law even for the upper - end of the labor income component of the high income individuals .",
    "this implies that the same process may give rise to exponential behavior at the lower end of the distribution while also being responsible for the power - law at the upper end , and models for explaining the observed income distributions should satisfy this criterion .",
    "based on the results reported above we conclude that the indian wealth distribution has a pareto exponent between 0.81 and 0.92 , while the income distribution is log - normal with a power - law tail having a pareto exponent close to 1.5 , the value predicted by pareto himself .",
    "one should of course note that these values are not sacrosanct and that there are several ways by which different values of the pareto exponent can be obtained for the same society .",
    "for example , the pareto exponent for the wealth distribution in uk has been reported to have values as different as 1.9 @xcite , 1.06 @xcite and 1.78 @xcite .",
    "the data based on which these exponents were obtained were of course for different years ( 1996,1997 and 2001 , respectively ) ; however , that need not be the only reason for this striking discrepancy among the values .",
    "for example , if the measured wealth consists solely ( or mostly ) of financial assets , in particular , stocks , as is likely for the wealths reported in the lists of the richest published by _ business standard _ and _ fortune _ , then the wealth inequality in a society is likely to be over - estimated if middle - income households have a larger proportion of their wealth as tangible assets ( such as house or automobile ) @xcite .",
    "thus , a study which considers only financial assets is likely to come up with a pareto exponent that differs substantially from another study that considers the non - financial assets reported in data collected for the purpose of calculating inheritance tax .",
    "another point worth considering is the relation between pareto exponent and gini coefficient , the most widely used measure of income inequality . according to the latter measure",
    ", india is less unequal than usa , and even uk @xcite .",
    "however , this is not consistent with the measured values of pareto exponent , if one associates lower values of the exponent with increased inequality . to resolve this issue",
    ", we note that if the distribution follows a power - law nature throughout , then a clear correspondence exists between the two measures , e.g. , a pareto exponent of 1.5 implies a gini coefficient of 0.5 @xcite . however , observed distributions show a power - law only over a very limited range , and hence the correspondence breaks down .",
    "in fact , in this case , it has for long been a matter of debate whether a higher value of pareto exponent indicates increased or decreased income inequality @xcite !"
