    "the corresponding system for the functions @xmath90 reads : @xmath116    note that in ( [ syst12 ] ) and ( [ syst01 ] ) initial conditions are determined by ( [ init2 ] ) modulo signs .",
    "however , changing the signs of the initial conditions may only result in changing the signs of the solutions ( in other words , we will get the same eigenfunctions possibly multiplied by @xmath117 ) .",
    "therefore , we may consider only non - negative initial conditions in ( [ syst12 ] ) and ( [ syst01 ] ) .",
    "our objective is to find values of @xmath118 such that the system has periodic solutions satisfying condition a , namely that both @xmath70 and @xmath83 have exactly two zeros on the period .",

    "of course , in principle , such an ansatz could make our system overdetermined : note that instead of two variables @xmath90 we now have one variable @xmath121 .",

    "* proof . *",
    "we prove this proposition with the help of oscillation theorems of haupt and sturm ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "as was mentioned in section 2.2 , due to courant s nodal domain theorem the first eigenvalue on a klein bottle of revolution can be obtained only from one of the three periodic sturm - liouville equations ( [ func:1 ] ) .",
    "we need to show that none of the these equations has an eigenfunction corresponding to an eigenvalue @xmath167 and satisfying the condition a as well as the parity conditions ( we are interested only in even eigenfunctions of the first and the third equation , and only in odd eigenfunctions of the second equation ) .    equations ( [ func:1 ] ) are subject to a theorem of haupt , stating that each eigenvalue problem has a sequence of eigenfunctions @xmath168 such that @xmath169 does not have zeros and @xmath170 have exactly @xmath171 zeros .",
    "let us study the equations ( [ eig ] ) for @xmath90 and @xmath84 separately .",
    "the easiest case is @xmath84  it has no zeros , and hence corresponds to the smallest eigenvalue of the sturm - liouville problem .    to handle @xmath83",
    ", we note that since it is odd , it should have zeros and therefore @xmath172-th eigenvalue for this problem is automatically out of question ( indeed , this eigenvalue @xmath173 is the first eigenvalue on the corresponding torus which covers our klein bottle ) .",
    "since @xmath83 has exactly two zeros , it is either @xmath174 or @xmath175 .",
    "assume there exists another odd solution @xmath176 of the eigenvalue problem with exactly @xmath177 zeros , and the corresponding @xmath178 . then by sturm theorem , between each zero of @xmath176 there should be zeros of @xmath83 , but",
    "since both of them vanish at @xmath172 , this will mean that @xmath83 should have at least @xmath179 zeros , while it has only @xmath177 , and we get a contradiction .",
    "indeed , numerically one can see that there exists another ( but even ) eigenfunction with @xmath177 zeros . for the normalized problem it corresponds to @xmath180 .",
    "a similar argument works for @xmath70 .",
    "note that in this case the @xmath172-th eigenfunction is just a constant , and hence is also not relevant .",
    "similarly , @xmath70 is either the first or the second eigenvalue .",
    "assume there is another even eigenfunction with exactly @xmath177 zeros corresponding to some @xmath181 .",
    "note that since it is even and periodic with period @xmath160 it should be symmetric with respect to the mid - point of the period @xmath182 ( indeed , @xmath183 ) , in particular its zeros have this symmetry  as do the zeros of @xmath70 . on the other hand , due to sturm theorem , between each zero of @xmath184",
    "there should be a zero of @xmath70 , or in other words zeros of @xmath70 and @xmath184 should interlace , but this contradicts the fact that they have the symmetry property ( symmetry implies that two zeros of one eigenfunction are between two zeros of the other ) .",
    "numerically one can observe that in reality @xmath184 is an odd function corresponding to @xmath185 .",
    "this completes the proof of the proposition .",
    "let us summarize the results of sections 3.1  3.4 .",
    "we have constructed a metric of revolution @xmath141 on a klein bottle , admitting an isometric embedding into @xmath0 by the first eigenfunctions .",
    "the first eigenvalue for this metric satisfies the equality @xmath186 where @xmath29 is a complete elliptic integral of the second kind . hence to complete the proof we just need to show that the metric @xmath141 is indeed an extremal metric for the first eigenvalue .",
    "we use proposition 1.1 of @xcite , implying that if the isometric immersion is given by a complete set of the first eigenfunctions ( i.e. if the eigenfunctions form a basis of the corresponding eigenspace ) , then the metric is extremal for @xmath2 .",
    "this is clearly the case for us , since we have used all five eigenfunctions to construct the immersion , and @xmath27 is the maximal possible multiplicity for the first eigenvalue on a klein bottle .",
    "it follows from the explicit formulas for the eigenfunctions in section 3.3 that it is in fact an embedding . to complete the proof of theorem [ klein ] it remains to show that the metric @xmath141 ( [ metric ] ) coincides up to a dilatation with the metric @xmath13 ( [ new1 ] )",

    "the solutions are given explicitly by the following formulas : @xmath254 where @xmath255 one can observe that these solutions are not periodic . as @xmath256 , we get the upper half of an ellipse in the plane @xmath257 .    in fact , since for @xmath253 the integral @xmath258 , if there existed a corresponding minimal isometric immersion of a klein bottle into @xmath0 it would be superminimal ( see @xcite ) . however , as indicated in the appendix of @xcite , the only superminimal surface immersed into @xmath0 by the first eigenfunctions is the standard sphere ( this result is attributed to n. ejiri ) .",
    "using corollary [ cor:1 ] we conclude that the condition a in section [ sec : min ] ( i.e. that @xmath106 both have two zeros in the period ) means that a periodic orbit should make _ one _ turn around the origin .",
    "the periodic solution corresponding to @xmath43 does exactly that ( the orbit in that case is the ellipse @xmath276 ) .",
    "consider the first ( for @xmath277 ) intersection of the trajectory on the @xmath259-plane with the @xmath70-axis .",
    "let @xmath278 be the intersection point , @xmath279 be the angle of the intersection .",
    "in this section we establish        assume now that for some @xmath284 the system has a periodic solution with period @xmath285 .",
    "we have @xmath286 the periodicity condition together with the condition a imply that @xmath287 and that @xmath288 but since @xmath70 is an even function , we also have @xmath289 the last equality implies @xmath281 .",
    "we have included the values of @xmath294 for @xmath295 values of @xmath118 , @xmath296 .",
    "those values were computed using a _ mathematica _",
    "the differential equation solved by that program is obtained by first writing the system of two second order differential equations for the variables @xmath297 corresponding to the change of variables @xmath298 then rewriting that system using @xmath121 as an independent variable ( we can do that for @xmath230 by corollary [ cor:1 ] ) .            *",
    "* since the angle @xmath279 is monotone , it takes the value @xmath280 only once .",
    "this happens exactly for @xmath299 so by proposition [ prop : symm1 ] , the only extremal metric on the interval @xmath290 is the metric @xmath13 .",
    "one would like to have a computer - assisted proof of conjecture [ conj2 ] , or of a weaker statement ( that still implies conjecture [ conj ] ) that the conclusion of proposition [ prop : symm1 ] only holds for @xmath43 .",
    "the main obstacle to finding a rigorous ( even a computer - assisted ) proof seems to be that the systems ( [ syst01 ] ) and ( [ syst12 ] ) are lacking stability , and therefore estimates for the dependence of the solutions on the initial conditions are very rough .",
    "accordingly , one has to make numerical measurements with the step not @xmath300 as in the previous section , but a dozen of orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "otherwise it seems impossible to control the behavior of the solutions between the two measurements .",
    "however , such precision seems to be beyond the reach of existing numerical software .",
    "a similar difficulty occurs near the ends of the interval @xmath301 .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath302 in fact that @xmath303 as @xmath304 for an explicit constant @xmath305 .",
    "consequently , if the system for @xmath284 has a periodic solution with period @xmath285 , then @xmath306 one can also show that there exists an explicit @xmath307 such that for any @xmath308 and for any metric @xmath309 on @xmath25 with the conformal class @xmath63 , we have ( in the notation of section [ sec : main ] ) , @xmath310    altogether this implies the existence of a computable constant @xmath293 such that an extremal metric for @xmath40 can not be attained for @xmath311 and @xmath312 .",
    "however , the value of @xmath313 we could obtain is way too small for being useful in a computer - assisted proof .",
