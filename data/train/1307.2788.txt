    "it is postulated in quantum physics that quantities we observe are eigenvalues of operators representing the dynamics of the quantities .",

    "in the conservative case @xmath11 , the power @xmath47 is independent of time , see . in that case , plots in figs .",
    "[ padd1 ] and [ sk3 ] correspond to varying power , i.e.  each trajectory has different value of @xmath47 , and a fixed energy , i.e.  the same value of first integral .",
    "however , it is not the common practice as usually one plots trajectories corresponding to the same value of power .    in the general case when @xmath16 , @xmath47 is no longer constant .",
    "it is therefore not possible to compose a similar phase portrait consisting of trajectories with constant @xmath47 .",
    "however , we find that one could instead plot phase - portraits with the same value of @xmath74 , which interestingly runs parallel with the different solutions observed at the same values of @xmath47 for @xmath11 , see .    when comparing periodic trajectories that all have the same value of power @xmath74 , it is useful to study the ( @xmath68,@xmath47)-phase plane , which qualitatively can be obtained by plotting and analysing ( see fig .",
    "[ sk4]b ) and . by doing this , we find that different values of @xmath74 can give different results in the ( @xmath25,@xmath14)-phase plane",
    ".    there are three important @xmath74 values to consider .",
    "the first is the minimum value @xmath74 can take .",

    "( [ eq : ksaddle ] ) .",
    "these values of @xmath74 are given respectively by @xmath103 substituting @xmath11 into the above expressions gives the important values of @xmath74 as 0 , 1 and 2 .",
    "realising that here @xmath104 makes clear that these are generalisations of the critical values found for @xmath47 when @xmath11 , where @xmath105 corresponds respectively to the presence of only trivial solution , the emergence of a pair of fixed points @xmath106 , and the emergence of rotational ( or running ) states @xcite .",
    "when @xmath107 all three of these values are equal , which is the threshold of total @xmath0-symmetry breaking , i.e.  there are no periodic , bounded solutions for @xmath31 .",
    "note that for any @xmath108 , there are two equilibrium points .",

    "note that the figures are actually composed of trajectories taken from the phase portraits with different values of @xmath33 sketched in fig .",
    "they can also be seen as the dynamical regimes for arbitrary initial conditions , showing the regions of periodic and unbounded solutions , that we refer to here as stability and instability regions .",
    "similar figures obtained using comprehensive numerical computations were presented in @xcite .    in panel ( a ) , all the solutions are periodic . as @xmath74 increases , there will be a critical value above which the only equilibrium point becomes unstable . when @xmath11 , this is where a pair of fixed points with nonzero @xmath14 emerges . for @xmath16",
    ", instead we have unbounded solutions .",
    "the instability region is nevertheless contained within the region of stable , periodic solutions . when @xmath74 is increased further passing , the stability region that contains the instability region vanishes completely .",
    "sukhorukov , xu , and kivshar @xcite also presented the dependence of the minimal input intensity on the gain / loss coefficient and the corresponding phase difference required for nonlinear switching , i.e.  the minimum intensity above which the solutions would be unbounded .",
    "according to the analytical results presented herein , those would correspond to the separatrices of ( see fig .  [ sk5 ] ) .",
    "analytical expressions should be derivable , that we leave for the interested reader .",
    "after analysing the nonlinear dimer with @xmath8 , finally we discuss the linear equations described by with @xmath9 .",
    "this is particularly interesting because the system has been realised experimentally in @xcite .    transforming the equations into the polar forms by similarly defining @xmath47 , @xmath14 and @xmath25",
    ", we obtain the same equations except ( [ eq : thetadot ] ) , which is now given by @xmath109    following the similar reduction , we obtain that instead of the constant of motion is given by @xmath110 this , instead of circles , is an equation for a straight line passing a distance @xmath33 from the origin . by parametrising the line with the new variable @xmath68 defined by @xmath111",
    "we find that ( cf .   and )",
    "@xmath112 where @xmath74 is also a constant of integration . using the above equations combined with the identity @xmath113 ( obtained from and ) in equation ( [ eq : deltadot ] )",
    "gives @xmath114 this is a forced , simple harmonic equation and therefore can be solved explicitly to give @xmath68 in terms of @xmath5 .",
    "due to the second equation in , we therefore can conclude that the oscillating power reported in , e.g. , @xcite has internal frequency @xmath115 .",
    "we have studied analytically linear and nonlinear @xmath0-symmetric dimers , where we described the whole dynamics of the system .",
    "the effect of nonlinearity that induces @xmath0-symmetry breaking for gain / loss parameters below that of the linear system , which in a previous work was referred to as nonlinear suppression of time - reversals @xcite , has been analysed as well .",
    "our analytical study may offer a new insight into the global dynamics of directional waveguide couplers with balanced gain and loss or bose - einstein condensates in a double - well potential with a balanced sink and source of atoms . in additions to our qualitative analysis",
    ", one could extend the study here to the analytical expression of the solutions of the nonlinear @xmath0-symmetric dimer , that may be expressed in terms of jacobi elliptic functions . in that case",
