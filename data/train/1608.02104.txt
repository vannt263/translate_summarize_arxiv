    "note that the three edges from the top vertex to the triangle in the upper floor belong , by periodicity , to the original periodic framework , which has six edges incident to every vertex . recall that we assumed an initial configuration with equilateral floor triangles and the vertical periods positioned over the centers of floor triangles . with the two new edge orbits ,",
    "we obtain a periodic framework with the same periodicity lattice , but with eight edges incident to every vertex . in the figure ,",
    "only the top vertex shows all eight bars incident to it . with these caveats taken into account",
    ", we proceed with the arguments which prove the auxetic character of the resulting periodic mechanism .    the triangle @xmath133 is determined by the two edges @xmath134 and @xmath132 , together with the median @xmath135 .",
    "this means that the horizontal period @xmath136 has determined length .",
    "since @xmath137 is the same period , the triangle @xmath138 is completely determined .",
    "thus , the periodic mechanism can only open up the dihedral angle of the planes @xmath139 and @xmath138 which have a common line with the direction of the period @xmath136 . since @xmath39 remains on the perpendicular bisector of @xmath136 , so does @xmath140 .",
    "thus , @xmath141 remains on the perpendicular bisector of @xmath142 .",
    "we have argued earlier that the vertical period remains vertical ( i.e. perpendicular on the floor ) and increases in length .",
    "all in all , the infinitesimal variation of the gram matrix of periods has two positive diagonal entries ( corresponding to the vertical period and @xmath143 ) and zero elsewhere .",
    "hence the motion is auxetic",
    ".    * remark . *  for a suggestive reading of figure  [ fig : roofing ] in higher dimension @xmath1 , the @xmath136 part of the floor triangle should be conceived as a facet of the floor simplex .",
    "the vertex @xmath39 will be connected to all but one of the vertices and edge - midpoints of the duplicated simplex in the lower floor .",
    "all edges incident to @xmath39 in the resulting one degree of freedom periodic framework are contained in two hyperplanes ( ` roofs ' ) , which play the role of the two planes @xmath133 and @xmath138 in the figure .",
    "the auxetic mechanism may be fancied as a periodic array of ( crisscrossing and interlaced ) opening roofs as proposed in figure  [ figmechanism ] .",
    "we may observe at this point that there are other ways of introducing new edge orbits for a reduction to one degree of freedom mechanisms .",
    "if we follow the pattern indicated in figure  [ figseries ] , we obtain a series of non - isomorphic periodic graphs with framework realizations which are auxetic periodic mechanisms .",
    "since the roof planes are the same in this series , the resulting auxetic mechanisms are kinematically equivalent , although structurally distinct .",
    "this shows that equivalence criteria in periodic auxetics must be introduced with some care .",
    "another aspect deserving attention when attempting classifications is affine equivalence , discussed in the next section .",
    "in this section we show that the infinitesimal auxetic cone of a periodic framework is preserved under affine transformations , that is , the natural isomorphism of the corresponding vector spaces of infinitesimal deformations @xcite , prop . 3.7 , pg .",
    "2639 , takes one auxetic cone to the other .",
    "while this fact is not directly intuitive , it has a straightforward and short proof in our geometric theory of periodic auxetics .",
    "we adopt the following notations and setting : @xmath144 is a periodic framework in @xmath2 , with @xmath68 vertex orbits and @xmath70 edge orbits . after a choice of independent generators for @xmath8 , the lattice of periods @xmath16 of the framework is described by a @xmath28 matrix @xmath62 , with columns given by the images of the generators .",
    "we denote by @xmath145 , @xmath146 the positions of a complete set of representatives for the vertex orbits .",
    "an infinitesimal deformation of the framework @xmath147 is determined by the infinitesimal variation @xmath148 of the positions @xmath145 and the infinitesimal variation @xmath149 of the periodicity matrix @xmath62 .    since the effect of translations is trivial , we assume our affine transformation to be a linear map @xmath150",
    ". then the transformed framework @xmath151 has vertex representatives at @xmath152 and periodicity matrix @xmath153 .",
    "the natural isomorphism between infinitesimal deformations takes @xmath154 for @xmath147 to @xmath155 for @xmath151 .",
    "thus , @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "auxetic deformations for @xmath147 are those with positive semidefinite @xmath158 and the isomorphism gives    @xmath159    confirming the preservation of the auxetic cone",
    ".    * remark . *  when interpreted in the context of our auxetic design principles , this result says that if a finite linkage @xmath72 in @xmath2 satisfies the strict auxetic prerequisites for @xmath1 pairs of vertices , then any affine transform of @xmath72 will satisfy those prerequisites for the corresponding @xmath1 pairs .",
    "nevertheless , the intervals where an auxetic path for the associated periodic frameworks would be defined may well differ .",
    "our gallery is dedicated to new examples in dimension three .",
    "we show that our main auxetic design principle can be applied to an infinite series of finite linkages in @xmath100 of a rather elementary nature .",
    "we use minimally rigid linkages with one edge removed and adequate marking of three pairs of vertices .",
    "let @xmath160 be an integer and consider a regular polygon with @xmath161 edges inscribed in the unit circle .",
    "the plane of the circle will be called horizontal .",
    "we mark as @xmath162 three vertices which have from one to another exactly @xmath68 edges and form an equilateral triangle .",
    "then , we take two points @xmath163 on the vertical axis through the center of the circle .",
    "the linkage denoted @xmath164 has @xmath165 vertices and @xmath166 edges and is obtained from the regular polygon by connecting @xmath167 and @xmath168 to all its vertices .",
    "when @xmath167 and @xmath168 are on opposite sides of the horizontal plane , we have the one - skeleton of a convex polyhedron with triangular faces . by cauchy s theorem ,",
    "the linkage is minimally rigid . by reflecting one part of the structure to the other side of the horizontal plane",
    ", we see that minimal rigidity holds as well , hence @xmath164 is minimally rigid either way .",
    "we ll need the case with @xmath167 and @xmath168 on the same side , say above the horizontal plane , and we assume @xmath167 closer to the plane .",
    "the linkage to be used for obtaining a periodic framework is denoted @xmath169 and is derived from @xmath164 by deleting an edge from the polygonal chain between @xmath170 and @xmath171 and marking the three pairs of vertices @xmath172 , @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "figure  [ figlk ] shows @xmath175 next to the planar diagram used for describing its motion .",
    "the deformation mechanism of @xmath169 is easily represented since the vertices of the horizontal polygon must remain coplanar : they are equally distanced from @xmath167 , respectively @xmath168 , hence on the circle of intersection of two spheres . when following the deformation trajectory in the direction of an augmenting radius for this intersection circle , the vector from @xmath167 to @xmath168 remains orthogonal to the circle plane and locally increases in length .",
    "thus , for strict auxeticity , we have to examine only the variation of the @xmath89 gram matrix of the two vectors , say @xmath176 , @xmath177 , corresponding to the pairs @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "this is an elementary computation . with the radius @xmath178 of the circle as parameter",
    ", we find :    @xmath179    where the expression of @xmath180 as a function of @xmath178 is given by    @xmath181    for the gram matrix @xmath182 , @xmath183 , it follows that @xmath184 is positive definite .",
    "we conclude ( via corollary  [ strict ] ) that the one degree of freedom periodic framework associated to @xmath169 is a strictly auxetic periodic mechanism in a neighborhood of the initial position .",
    "thus , with @xmath160 , we obtain an infinite series of distinct auxetic periodic structures",
    ".    * remark .",
    "*  considering that a small enough change in the placement of the vertices will maintain strict auxeticity , the self - crossing resulting in the periodic framework from the planarity of the polygonal vertices in @xmath169 can be avoided by starting with a slightly distorted version of @xmath169 .",
    "the mathematical design principles presented here are based on the geometric foundations of periodic auxetics introduced in @xcite .",
    "we have shown that , in spite of a rather conspicuous sparsity of auxetic designs in the existing literature , there are unlimited possibilities for generating periodic frameworks with auxetic capabilities in any dimension .",
    "the main procedure discussed in this paper converts any finite bar - and - joint mechanism in @xmath2 with adequate motion for @xmath1 marked pairs of joints into an auxetic periodic framework mechanism .",
