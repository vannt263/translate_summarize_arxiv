    "it is already a well - known fact that localized vibrational excitations can exist in perfect anharmonic lattices @xcite .",
    "such excitations are called intrinsic localized modes ( ilms ) @xcite , discrete breathers @xcite or discrete solitons @xcite .",
    "the main approach , which has been used for the study of these vibrational excitations so far , is molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations , which are based on the numerical integration of the classical equations of motion in a lattices with a finite number of the degrees of freedom .",
    "the approach is rather efficient in the case of simple 1d lattices ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , but requires very lengthy computations in the case of 2d and 3d lattices due to the rapid growth of the number of numerical operations with the increase of the number of the vibrational degrees of freedom ( see @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , it is of interest to develop other methods which would allow one , when studying ilms , to reduce the amount of numerical computations .",
    "below we are developing a mean - field - type theory of ilms which allows one to perform calculations for macroscopically large lattices of arbitrary dimensions .",
    "the theory is based on the consideration of small variations of the ilm amplitude .",
    "the equations for these variations include characteristics of the ilm .",
    "this allows us to reduce the nonlinear problem of the ilm to a linear problem of the perturbed phonon dynamics ; the perturbation comes from the ilm and it is determined self - consistently . to describe the effect of the perturbation we apply the greens function method of the perturbed local dynamics of phonons ( the lifshitz method ) , allowing us to calculate the ilm . as compared to the method @xcite , which also uses the greens functions of the perfect harmonic lattice for calculations of strongly localized ilms , our method works generally , including the cases when ilms have remarkable size . to test the theory",
    ", we consider the even and odd ilms in a monatomic chain . in parallel ,",
    "the molecular dynamics simulations of these ilms are carried out .",
    "the comparison of the results of both calculations shows an excellent agreement .",
    "let us start with the classical equations of the motion of atoms in a lattice @xmath0 here @xmath1 is the cartesian displacement of the atom @xmath2 , @xmath3 is its mass , @xmath4 are the harmonic and anharmonic springs ; the subscripts @xmath2 include both the site number and the number of the cartesian component .",
    "we are considering a localized solution of the equation ( [ ddotu ] ) describing the stable ilm .",
    "the corresponding displacements of atoms are of the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the frequency of the ilm which lies outside the phonon spectrum , @xmath7 is the amplitude of the ilm at the site @xmath2 , @xmath8 is the shift of the equilibrium position of the atom @xmath2 ( i.e. the dc - component of the ilm ; this component differs from zero due to odd anharmonicities ) , @xmath9 is the sum of the higher harmonics .",
    "the contributions of these harmonics are usually rather small @xcite . below they will be neglected .    in our further consideration ,",
    "we shall make use of the fact that @xmath10 is also a periodic solution of the equation ( [ ddotu ] ) .",
    "taking @xmath11 to be infinitesimal , we can find small variation of the ilm @xmath12 , which also oscillate in time with the frequency @xmath6 and amplitudes @xmath13 ( note the phase shift @xmath14 of @xmath15 ) ; it satisfies the equation : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the anharmonic part of the potential energy .",
    "we consider the @xmath18 terms of this equation ( i.e. we neglect higher - order harmonics of it ) .",
    "taking into account that the @xmath18 term of the product @xmath19 coincides with the time - independent term of the product @xmath20 we get @xmath21 where @xmath22 here the partial derivative is taken for @xmath23 , @xmath24 denotes the averaging over the period @xmath25 .",
    "the dc - shifts @xmath26 are not the independent parameters of the problem : they are determined by the ilm amplitudes .",
    "the corresponding relation reads @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 @xmath29 is the static limit ( @xmath30 ) of the green s function of the perfect lattice @xcite",
    "@xmath31 @xmath32 is the polarization vector of the phonon @xmath33 , @xmath34 is its wave vector .",
    "our further consideration is based on the observation that the equation ( [ eq_q_n ] ) corresponds to the following harmonic potential energy @xmath35 this potential energy , if the amplitude parameters @xmath36 are chosen correctly , should lead to the appearance of the linear local mode , being an infinitesimal part of the ilm .",
    "the potential @xmath37 constitutes a mean field for the linear mode and , therefore for the ilm .",
    "the matrix @xmath38 gives the required change of the elastic springs .",
    "the potential @xmath37 should be determined self - consistently .",
    "this can be done by applying the lifshitz method @xcite of the local dynamics in harmonic approximation . in this method ,",
    "the amplitude parameters satisfy the relations @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the matrix of the perturbed green s function being equal @xcite @xmath41 the frequency @xmath6 is given by the position of the pole of @xmath40 outside the phonon spectrum . taking into account that the amplitude parameters @xmath36 enter into the perturbation matrix @xmath42",
    ", one can conclude that equations ( [ self ] ) together with the pole condition @xmath43 constitute the self - consistency equations .    to calculate an ilm by means of the proposed method",
    ", one should choose the main amplitude(s ) of the ilm and to fix a possible values of few other amplitudes . using these amplitudes",
    "one can find the dc - shifts @xmath8 by solving the equation ( [ xi_n ] ) .",
    "inserting obtained @xmath8 into eq .",
    "( [ vperturb ] ) one can calculate matrix @xmath42 .",
    "after that one should calculate the frequency of the ilm and the relative amplitudes , using equations ( [ green_omega ] ) and ( [ self ] ) . if the obtained @xmath36 differ from the chosen initially , the calculations should be repeated with newly found amplitudes .    the presented theory can be applied for different , including 3d , anharmonic lattices .",
    "as a test of the presented theory we consider the well - known case of ilms in a monatomic chain , taking into account only the nearest - neighbor interactions and the positive quartic anharmonicity .",
    "the potential energy of vibrations in this case has the form @xmath44 , \\label{vchane}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the difference of the shifts of the particles @xmath2 and @xmath46 .",
    "the top phonon frequency equals @xmath47 . in our calculations we took @xmath48 which corresponds to @xmath49 .",
    "the green s functions of the harmonic chain equal @xcite @xmath50^{|n - n'|}/ \\omega \\sqrt{\\omega^2 -1 } , \\label{chenegreen}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 ( in eq . ( [ chenegreen ] )",
    "the units @xmath52 are used ) .",
    "the dc - shifts in this model equal zero , and the equation for the perturbation matrix @xmath42 can be found strightforward : @xmath53 here @xmath54 is the renormalization of the elastic spring between the atoms @xmath2 and @xmath46 , @xmath55 . for @xmath56 all",
    "@xmath57 are positive .",
    "therefore the ilms appear above the phonon spectrum ; they have an odd or an even symmetry .",
    "first we study an even ilm centered at the atoms @xmath58 and @xmath59 . in this case",
    ", the amplitude parameters satisfy the condition @xmath60 .",
    "we consider only ilms which have the largest amplitude on the atoms @xmath58 and @xmath61 and take into account the contributions of @xmath62 central atoms . in this case",
    "we include into consideration the renormalization of @xmath63 central springs given by @xmath64 and @xmath65 ( see eq .",
    "( [ digamma ] ) ) .",
    "these parameters can be determined together with the frequency and the amplitudes self - consistently using the equations ( [ green_omega ] ) and ( [ self ] ) .",
    "the latter we treat iteratively : we start with the amplitude ratios given in @xcite and then find the frequency , the values of the amplitudes and then their corrections from these equations and so on .",
    "the iteration procedure converges fast .",
    "the results of the calculations can be seen in table 1 and in fig . 1 ( theory ) .",
    "now we consider an odd ilm centered at the @xmath58 atom .",
    "then the amplitude parameters of the ilms satisfy the condition @xmath66 .",
    "we restrict ourself with consideration only of ilms having the largest amplitude on the central atom , and take into account the contribution of @xmath63 central atoms . in this case",
    "we take into account the changes by the ilms of @xmath67 central springs given by @xmath68 and @xmath69 ( see eq .",
    "( [ digamma ] ) ) . as in the case of even ilms , the springs parameters are determined together with the frequency and the amplitudes self - consistently using the equations ( [ green_omega ] ) and ( [ self ] ) .",
    "the results of the calculations can be seen in fig . 1 ( theory ) and in table 1 .",
    "in the case under consideration , one can easily find the ilms numerically by integrating the equations of motion . in our calculations we used the forth - order runge - kutta algorithm .",
    "the results of calculations are compared with the theory . in fig . 1 and in table 1",
    "one can see that the theoretical and the md calculations of the ilms frequencies and amplitudes are in very good agreement .",
