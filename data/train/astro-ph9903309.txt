    "this is because there are many photons in the exponential tail of the photon energy distribution with energies @xmath22 despite the fact that the temperature or @xmath23 is less than @xmath24 . during this delay ,",

    "there is however an important source of systematic error due to the possibility that li has been depleted in these stars , though the lack of dispersion in the li data limits the amount of depletion .",
    "in addition , standard stellar models@xcite predict that any depletion of 7 would be accompanied by a very severe depletion of 6 . until recently",

    "be and b have been observed in these same pop ii stars and in particular there are a dozen or so stars in which both be and 7 have been observed .",
    "thus be ( and b though there is still a paucity of data ) can be used as a consistency check on primordial li @xcite .",
    "based on the be abundance found in these stars , one can conclude that no more than 10 - 20% of the 7 is due to cosmic ray nucleosynthesis leaving the remainder ( an abundance near @xmath27 ) as primordial .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached in @xcite . the dashed box in figure [ nuc8 ] , accounts for the possibility that as much as half of the primordial 7 has been destroyed in stars , and that as much as 20% of the observed 7 may have been produced in cosmic ray collisions rather than in the big bang . for 7 ,",
    "the uncertainties are clearly dominated by systematic effects .",
    "at this point , having established the primordial abundance of at least two of the light elements , 4 and 7 , with reasonable certainty , it is possible to test the concordance of bbn theory with observations .",
    "monte carlo techniques have proven to be a useful form of analysis in this regard @xcite .",
    "two elements are sufficient for not only constraining the one parameter theory of bbn , but also for testing for consistency @xcite .",
    "the procedure begins by establishing likelihood functions for the theory and observations .",

    "finally , there have been several reported measurements of d / h in high redshift quasar absorption systems .",
    "such measurements are in principle capable of determining the primordial value for d / h and hence @xmath0 , because of the strong and monotonic dependence of d / h on @xmath0 . however , at present , detections of d / h using quasar absorption systems do not yield a conclusive value for d / h . as such",
    ", it should be cautioned that these values may not turn out to represent the true primordial value and it is very unlikely that both are primordial and indicate an inhomogeneity @xcite ( a large scale inhomogeneity of the magnitude required to placate all observations is excluded by the isotropy of the microwave background radiation ) .",
    "the first of these measurements @xcite indicated a rather high d / h ratio , d / h @xmath56 1.9  2.5 @xmath57 .",
    "other high d / h ratios were reported in @xcite .",
    "more recently , a similarly high value of d / h = 2.0 @xmath58 was reported in a relatively low redshift system ( making it less suspect to interloper problems ) @xcite .",
    "this was confirmed in @xcite where a 95% cl lower bound to d / h was reported as 8 @xmath59 .",

    "the abundance in these systems has been revised upwards to about 3.4 @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "however , it was also noted @xcite that when using mesoturbulent models to account for the velocity field structure in these systems , the abundance may be somewhat higher ( 3.5  5 @xmath62 ) .",
    "this may be quite significant , since at the upper end of this range ( 5 @xmath59 ) all of the element abundances are consistent as will be discussed shortly .",

    "there is also a recent ism measurement of 3 @xcite with @xmath64 .",
    "finally there are observations of 3 in planetary nebulae @xcite which show a very high 3 abundance of 3/h @xmath65 .",
    "none of these determinations represent the primordial 3 abundance , and as will be discussed below , their relation to the primordial abundance is heavily dependent on both stellar and chemical evolution .",
    "it is interesting to compare the results from the likelihood functions of 4 and 7 with that of d / h . since d and 3 are monotonic functions of @xmath0 , a prediction for @xmath0 , based on 4 and 7 , can be turned into a prediction for d and 3 .",

    "otherwise , to match the solar and present abundances of d and 3 to their primordial values requires a model of galactic chemical evolution .",

    "this result appears to be independent of the chemical evolution model and is directly related to the assumed stellar yields of 3 .",
    "it has recently been suggested that at least some low mass stars may indeed be net destroyers of 3 if one includes the effects of extra mixing below the conventional convection zone in low mass stars on the red giant branch @xcite .",
    "the extra mixing does not take place for stars which do not undergo a helium core flash ( i.e. stars @xmath86 1.7 - 2 m@xmath85 ) .",

    "to do so however , comes with a price .",
    "large deuterium destruction factors require substantial amounts of stellar processing , which at the same time produce heavy elements . to keep the heavy element abundances in the galaxy in check , significant galactic winds enriched in heavy elements",

    "limits on particle physics beyond the standard model are mostly sensitive to the bounds imposed on the 4 abundance .",
    "as is well known , the @xmath92he abundance is predominantly determined by the neutron - to - proton ratio just prior to nucleosynthesis and is easily estimated assuming that all neutrons are incorporated into 4 . as discussed earlier ,",
    "the neutron - to - proton ratio is fixed by its equilibrium value at the freeze - out of the weak interaction rates at a temperature @xmath93 mev modulo the occasional free neutron decay .",
    "furthermore , freeze - out is determined by the competition between the weak interaction rates and the expansion rate of the universe @xmath94 where @xmath3 counts the total ( equivalent ) number of relativistic particle species .",
    "the presence of additional neutrino flavors ( or any other relativistic species ) at the time of nucleosynthesis increases the overall energy density of the universe and hence the expansion rate leading to a larger value of @xmath95 , @xmath15 , and ultimately @xmath38 . because of the form of eq .",
    "( [ comp ] ) it is clear that just as one can place limits @xcite on @xmath3 , any changes in the weak or gravitational coupling constants can be similarly constrained ( for a recent discussion see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "as discussed above , the limit on @xmath1 comes about via the change in the expansion rate given by the hubble parameter , h^2 = 8 g 3 = 8 ^3 g 90 [ n_sm + 7 8 n _ ] t^4 when compared to the weak interaction rates . here",
    "@xmath96 refers to the standard model value for n. at @xmath97 mev , @xmath98 .",
    "additional degrees of freedom will lead to an increase in the freeze - out temperature eventually leading to a higher 4 abundance .",
    "in fact , one can parameterize the dependence of @xmath29 on @xmath1 by y = 0.2262 + 0.0131 ( n_- 3 ) + 0.0135 _ 10 [ yy ] in the vicinity of @xmath99 .",
    "( [ yy ] ) also shows the weak ( log ) dependence on @xmath0 .",
    "however , rather than use ( [ yy ] ) to obtain a limit , it is preferable to use the likelihood method .    just as 4 and 7 were sufficient to determine a value for @xmath0 , a limit on @xmath1 can be obtained as well @xcite .",
    "the likelihood approach utilized above can be extended to include @xmath1 as a free parameter .",
    "since the light element abundances can be computed as functions of both @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the likelihood function can be defined by @xcite replacing the quantity @xmath100 in eq .",
    "( [ gau ] ) with @xmath101 to obtain @xmath102 .",
    "again , similar expressions are needed for 7 and d.    a three - dimensional view of the combined likelihood functions @xcite is shown in figure [ fig : oth31 ] . in this case the high and low @xmath0 maxima of figure [ fig : fig2 ] , show up as peaks in the @xmath103 space .",
    "the likelihood function is labeled @xmath104 ( and @xmath105 when d / h is included ) . in figures [ fig : oth32 ] and [ fig : oth33 ] the corresponding likelihood functions @xmath105 with high and low d / h are shown .",
    "once again one sees an effect of including d / h is to eliminate one of the 7 peaks .",
    "furthermore , unlike the case discussed in section 6 , the likelihood distribution for low d / h is just as strong as that for high d / h , albeit at a lower value of @xmath1 .",
    "the peaks of the distribution as well as the allowed ranges of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are more easily discerned in the contour plots of figures [ fig : oth34 ] and [ fig : oth35 ] which show the 50% , 68% and 95% confidence level contours in @xmath104 and @xmath105 for high and low d / h as indicated .",
    "the crosses show the location of the peaks of the likelihood functions .",
    "@xmath104 peaks at @xmath106 , @xmath107 and at @xmath108 , @xmath109 .",
    "the 95% confidence level allows the following ranges in @xmath0 and @xmath1 1.7n_4.3 1.4_104.9 note however that the ranges in @xmath0 and @xmath1 are strongly correlated as is evident in figure [ fig : oth34 ] .    with high d / h , @xmath105 peaks at @xmath110 , and also at @xmath107 . in this case",
    "the 95% contour gives the ranges 2.2n_4.4 1.4_102.4 note that within the 95% cl range , there is also a small area with @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "similarly , for low d / h , @xmath105 peaks at @xmath113 , and @xmath114 .",
    "the 95% cl upper limit is now @xmath115 , and the range for @xmath0 is @xmath116 .",
    "it is important to stress that with the increase in the determined value of d / h @xcite in the low d / h systems , these abundances are now consistent with the standard model value of @xmath117 at the 2 @xmath73 level .     for observed abundances given by eqs .",
    "( [ he4 ] and [ li ] ) . ]     for observed abundances including high d / h . ]     for observed abundances including low d / h . ]     and @xmath105 where observed abundances are given by eqs .",
    "( [ he4 ] and [ li ] ) , and high d / h . ]     and @xmath105 where observed abundances are given by eqs .",
    "( [ he4 ] and [ li ] ) , and low d / h . ]",
    "to summarize , i would assert that one can conclude that the present data on the abundances of the light element isotopes are consistent with the standard model of big bang nucleosynthesis . using the isotopes with the best data , 4 and 7 ,",
    "it is possible to constrain the theory and obtain a best set of values for the baryon - to - photon ratio of @xmath28 and the corresponding value for @xmath118      for @xmath119 , we have a range @xmath120 .",
    "this is a rather low value for the baryon density and would suggest that much of the galactic dark matter is non - baryonic @xcite .",
    "these predictions are in addition consistent with recent observations of d / h in quasar absorption systems which show a high value .",
    "difficulty remains however , in matching the solar 3 abundance , suggesting a problem with our current understanding of galactic chemical evolution or the stellar evolution of low mass stars as they pertain to 3 .",
