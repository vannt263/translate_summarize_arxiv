    "the theory of complex networks @xcite has flourished thanks to the availability of new datasets on large complex systems , such as the internet or the interaction networks inside the cell . in the last ten years attention",
    "has been focusing mainly on static or growing complex networks , with little emphasis on the rewiring of the links .",
    "the topology of these networks and their modular structure @xcite are able to affect the dynamics taking place on them @xcite .",
    "only recently temporal networks @xcite , dominated by the dynamics of rewirings , are starting to attract the attention of quantitative scientists working on complexity .",
    "one of the most beautiful examples of temporal networks are social interaction networks . indeed",
    ", social networks @xcite are intrinsically dynamical and social interactions are continuously formed and dissolved .",
    "recently we are gaining new insights into the structure and dynamics of these temporal social networks , thanks to the availability of a new generation of datasets recording the social interactions of the fast time scale .",
    "in fact , on one side we have data on face - to - face interactions coming from mobile user devices technology @xcite , or radio - frequency - identification - devices @xcite , on the other side , we have extensive datasets on mobile - phone calls @xcite and agent mobility @xcite .",
    "this new generation of data has changed drastically the way we look at social networks .",
    "in fact , the adaptability of social networks is well known and several models have been suggested for the dynamical formation of social ties and the emergence of connected societies @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the strength and nature of a social tie remained difficult to quantify for several years despite the careful sociological description by granovetter @xcite . only recently , with the availability of data on social interactions and their dynamics on the fast time scale , it has become possible to assign to each acquaintance the strength or weight of the social interaction quantified as the total amount of time spent together by two agents in a given time window @xcite .",
    "the recent data revolution in social sciences is not restricted to data on social interaction but concerns all human activities @xcite , from financial transaction to mobility . from these new data on human dynamics evidence",
    "is emerging that human activity is bursty and is not described by poisson processes @xcite .",
    "indeed , a universal pattern of bursty activities was observed in human dynamics such as broker activity , library loans or email correspondence .",
    "social interactions are not an exception , and there is evidence that face - to - face interactions have a distribution of duration well approximated by a power - law @xcite while they remain modulated by circadian rhythms @xcite .",
    "the bursty activity of social networks has a significant impact on dynamical processes defined on networks @xcite .",
    "here we compare these observations with data coming from a large dataset of mobile - phone communication @xcite and show that human social interactions , when mediated by a technology , such as the mobile - phone communication , demonstrate the adaptability of human behavior .",
    "indeed , the distribution of duration of calls does not follow any more a power - law distribution but has a characteristic scale determined by the weights of the links , and is described by a weibull distribution . at the same time , however , this distribution remains bursty and strongly deviates from a poisson distribution .",
    "we will show that both the power - law distribution of durations of social interactions and the weibull distribution of durations and social interactions observed respectively in face - to - face interaction datasets and in mobile - phone communication activity can be explained phenomenologically by a model with a reinforcement dynamics @xcite responsible for the deviation from a pure poisson process . in this model ,",
    "the longer two agents interact , the smaller is the probability that they split apart , and the longer an agent is non interacting , the less likely it is that he / she will start a new social interaction .",
    "we observe here that this framework is also necessary to explain the group formation in simple animals @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the reinforcement dynamics of social interactions , much like the hebbian dynamics , might have a neurobiological foundation .",
    "furthermore , this is supported by the results on the bursty mobility of rodents @xcite and on the recurrence patterns of words encountered in online conversations @xcite . we have therefore found ways to quantify the adaptability of human behavior to different technologies .",
    "we observe here that this change of behavior corresponds to the very fast time dynamics of social interactions and it is not related to macroscopic change of personality consistently with the results of @xcite on online social networks .",
    "moreover , temporal social networks encode information @xcite in their structure and dynamics .",
    "this information is necessary for efficiently navigating @xcite the network , and to build collaboration networks @xcite that are able to enhance the performance of a society .",
    "recently , several authors have focused on measures of entropy and information for networks .",
    "the entropy of network ensembles is able to quantify the information encoded in a structural feature of networks such as the degree sequence , the community structure , and the physical embedding of the network in a geometric space @xcite .",
    "the entropy rate of a dynamical process on the networks , such a biased random walk , are also able to characterize the interplay between structure of the networks and the dynamics occurring on them @xcite .",
    "finally , the mutual information for the data of email correspondence was shown to be fruitful in characterizing the community structure of the networks @xcite and the entropy of human mobility was able to set the limit of predictability of human movements @xcite .    here",
    "we will characterize the entropy of temporal social networks as a proxy to characterize the predictability of the dynamical nature of social interaction networks .",
    "this entropy will quantify how many typical configurations of social interactions we expect at any given time , given the history of the network dynamical process .",
    "we will evaluate this entropy on a typical day of mobile - phone communication directly from data showing modulation of the dynamical entropy during the circadian rhythm .",
    "moreover we will show that when the distribution of duration of contacts changes from a power - law distribution to a weibull distribution the level of information and the value of the dynamical entropy significantly change indicating that human adaptability to new technology is a further way to modulate the information content of dynamical social networks .",
    "human social dynamics is bursty , and the distribution of inter - event times follows a universal trend showing power - law tails .",
    "this is true for e - mail correspondence events , library loans , and broker activity .",
    "social interactions are not an exception to this rule , and the distribution of inter - event time between face - to - face social interactions has power - law tails @xcite .",
    "interestingly enough , social interactions have an additional ingredient with respect to other human activities . while sending an email can be considered an instantaneous event characterized by the instant in which the email is sent , social interactions have an intrinsic duration which is a proxy of the strength of a social tie .",
    "in fact , social interactions are the microscopic structure of social ties and a tie can be quantified as the total time two agents interact in a given time - window .",
    "new data on the fast time scale of social interactions have been now gathered with different methods which range from bluetooth sensors @xcite , to the new generation of radio - frequency - identification - devices @xcite . in all these data",
    "there is evidence that face - to - face interactions have a duration that follows a distribution with a power - law tail .",
    "moreover , there is also evidence that the inter - contact times have a distribution with fat tails . in this chapter",
    "we report a figure of ref .",
    "@xcite ( fig .",
    "[ barrat ] of this chapter ) in which the duration of contact in radio - frequency - device experiments conducted by sociopatterns experiments is clearly fat tailed and well approximated by a power - law ( straight line on the log - log plot ) . in this figure",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite report the distribution of the duration of binary interactions and the distribution of duration of a the triangle of interacting agents .",
    "moreover they report data for the distribution of inter - event time .",
    "how do these distributions change when human agents are interfaced with a new technology ?",
    "this is a major question that arises if we want to characterize the universality of these distributions . in this book chapter",
    "we report an analysis of mobile - phone data and we show evidence of human adaptability to a new technology .",
    "we have analysed the call sequence of subscribers of a major european mobile service provider . in the dataset",
    "the users were anonymized and impossible to track .",
    "we considered calls between users who called each other mutually at least once during the examined period of @xmath0 months in order to examine calls only reflecting trusted social interactions .",
    "the resulted event list consists of @xmath1 calls between @xmath2 users .",
    "we have performed measurements for the distribution of call durations and non - interaction times of all the users for the entire 6 months time period .",
    "the distribution of phone call durations strongly deviates from a fat - tail distribution . in fig .",
    "[ interaction ] we report these distributions and show that they depend on the strength @xmath3 of the interactions ( total duration of contacts in the observed period ) but do not depend on the age , gender or type of contract in a significant way .",
    "the distribution @xmath4 of duration of contacts within agents with strength @xmath3 is well fitted by a weibull distribution @xmath5 with @xmath6 .",
    "the typical times of interactions between users @xmath7 depend on the weight @xmath3 of the social tie .",
    "in particular the values used for the data collapse of figure 3 are listed in table [ tauw ] .",
    "these values are broadly distributed , and there is evidence that such heterogeneity might depend on the geographical distance between the users @xcite .",
    "the weibull distribution strongly deviates from a power - law distribution to the extent that it is characterized by a typical time scale @xmath8 , while power - law distribution does not have an associated characteristic scale .",
    "the origin of this significant change in the behavior of humans interactions could be due to the consideration of the cost of the interactions although we are not in the position to draw these conclusions ( see fig . [ pay ] in which we compare distribution of duration of calls for people with different type of contract ) or might depend on the different nature of the communication .",
    "the duration of a phone call is quite short and is not affected significantly by the circadian rhythms of the population . on the contrary , the duration of no - interaction periods is strongly affected by the periodic daily of weekly rhythms . in fig .",
    "[ non - interaction ] we report the distribution of duration of no - interaction periods in the day periods between 7 am and 2 am next day .",
    "the typical times @xmath9 used in figure 5 are listed in table [ tauk ] .",

    "it has been recognized that human dynamics is not poissonian .",
    "several models have been proposed for explaining a fundamental case study of this dynamics , the data on email correspondence .",
    "the two possible explanations of bursty email correspondence are described in the following .    * a queueing model of tasks with different priorities",
    "has been suggested to explain bursty interevent time .",
    "this model implies rational decision making and correlated activity patterns @xcite .",
    "this model gives rise to power - law distribution of inter event times .",
    "* a convolution of poisson processes due to different activities during the circadian rhythms and weekly cycles have been suggested to explain bursty inter event time .",
    "these different and multiple poisson processes are introducing a set of distinct characteristic time scales on human dynamics giving rise to fat tails of interevent times @xcite .    in the previous section",
    "we have showed evidence that the duration of social interactions is generally non poissonian .",
    "indeed , both the power - law distribution observed for duration of face - to - face interactions and the weibull distribution observed for duration of mobile - phone communication strongly deviate from an exponential .",
    "the same can be stated for the distribution of duration of non - interaction times , which strongly deviates from an exponential distribution both for face - to - face interactions and for mobile - phone communication . in order to explain the data on duration of contacts we can not use any of the models proposed for bursty interevent time in email correspondence . in fact , on one side it is unlikely that the decision to continue a conversation depends on rational decision making .",
    "moreover the queueing model @xcite can not explain the observed stretched exponential distribution of duration of calls . on the other side , the duration of contacts it is not effected by circadian rhythms and weekly cycles which are responsible for bursty behavior in the model @xcite .",
    "this implies that a new theoretical framework is needed to explain social interaction data .",
    "therefore , in order to model the temporal social networks we have to abandon the generally considered assumption that social interactions are generated by a poisson process . in this assumption",
    "the probability for two agents to start an interaction or to end an interaction is constant in time and not affected by the duration of the social interaction .     instead , to build a model for human social interactions we have to consider a reinforcement dynamics , in which the probability to start an interaction depends on how long an individual has been non - interacting , and the probability to end an interaction depends on the duration of the interaction itself .",
    "generally , to model the human social interactions , we can consider an agent - based system consisting of @xmath11 agents that can dynamically interact with each other and give rise to interacting agent groups . in the following subsections we give more details on the dynamics of the models .",
    "we denote by the state @xmath12 of the agent , the number of agents in his / her group ( including itself ) .",
    "in particular we notice here that a state @xmath13 for an agent , denotes the fact that the agent is non - interacting . a reinforcement dynamics for such system",
    "is defined in the following frame .",
    "+ the longer an agent is interacting in a group the smaller is the probability that he / she will leave the group . + the longer an agent is non - interacting the smaller is the probability that he / she will form or join a new group .",
    "+ the probability that an agent @xmath14 change his / her state ( value of @xmath12 ) is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath11 is the total number of agents in the model and @xmath17 is the last time the agent @xmath14 has changed his / her state , and @xmath18 is a parameter of the model .",
    "the reinforcement mechanism is satisfied by any function @xmath19 that is decreasing with @xmath20 but social - interaction data currently available are reproduced only for this particular choice @xmath19 .",
    "the function @xmath21 only depends on the actual time in which the decision is made .",
    "this function is able to modulate the activity during the day and throughout the weekly rhythms . for the modelling of the interaction data we will first assume that the function @xmath21 is a constant in time . moreover in the following subsections",
    "we will show that in order to obtain power - law distribution of duration of contacts and non - interaction times ( as it is observed in face - to - face interaction data ) we have to take @xmath22 while in order to obtain weibull distribution of duration of contacts we have to take @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , summarizing here the results of the following two sections , we can conclude with the following statement for the adaptability of human social interactions     + the adaptability of human social interactions to technology can be seen as an effective way to modulate the parameter @xmath18 in eq . @xmath24 parametrizing the probability to start or to end the social interactions .      here",
    "we recall the model of face - to - face interactions presented in @xcite and we delineate the main characteristics and outcomes .",
    "a simple stochastic dynamics is imposed to the agent - based system in order to model face - to - face interactions .",
    "starting from given initial conditions , the dynamics of face - to - face interactions at each time step @xmath25 is implemented as the following algorithm .    * an agent @xmath14 is chosen randomly . *",

    "this seems to be a very reasonable assumption if we want to model face - to - face interactions in small conferences , which are venues designed to stimulate interactions between the participants .",

    "@xmath101 are given by p_1^k ( ) e^-b_1(1+ck ) + p_2^w ( ) e^-2b_2g(w ) .",
    "therefore the probability distributions @xmath97 and @xmath98 are exponentials as expected in a poisson process .",
    "in this section we introduce the entropy of temporal social networks as a measure of information encoded in their dynamics .",
    "we can assume that the following stochastic dynamics takes place in the network : according to this dynamics at each time step @xmath25 , different interacting groups can be formed and can be dissolved giving rise to the temporal social networks .",
    "the agents are embedded in a social network @xmath66 such that interaction can occur only by acquaintances between first neighbors of the network @xmath66 .",
    "this is a good approximation if we want to model social interactions on the fast time scale . in the case of a small conference , where each participant is likely to discuss with any other participant we can consider a fully connected network as the underlying network @xmath66 of social interactions . in the network",
    "@xmath66 each set of interacting agents can be seen as a connected subgraph of @xmath110 , as shown in fig [ fig1 ] .",
    "we use an indicator function @xmath111 to denote , at time @xmath25 , the maximal set @xmath112 , @xmath113 , ... , @xmath114 of interacting agents in a group . if @xmath115 is the maximal set of interacting agents in a group , we let @xmath116 otherwise we put @xmath117 . therefore at any given time the following relation is satisfied , @xmath118 where @xmath110 is an arbitrary connected subgraph of @xmath66",
    ". then we denote by @xmath119 the history of the dynamical social networks , and @xmath120 the probability that @xmath121 given the history @xmath122",
    ". therefore the likelihood that at time @xmath25 the dynamical social networks has a group configuration @xmath123 is given by @xmath124    we denote the entropy of the dynamical networks as @xmath125 indicating the logarithm of the typical number of all possible group configurations at time @xmath25 which can be explicitly written as @xmath126    the value of the entropy can be interpreted as following : if the entropy is larger , the dynamical network is less predictable , and several possible dynamic configurations of groups are expected in the system at time @xmath25 . on the other hand ,",
    "a smaller entropy indicates a smaller number of possible future configuration and a temporal network state which is more predictable .      in this subsection",
    "we discuss the evaluation of the entropy of phone - call communication . for phone - call communication ,",
    "we only allow pairwise interaction in the system such that the product in eq.([likelihood ] ) is only taken over all single nodes and edges of the quenched network @xmath66 which yields @xmath127 with @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the adjacency matrix of @xmath66 .",
    "the entropy then takes a simple form @xmath130      in this subsection we use the entropy of temporal social networks to analyze the information encoded in a major european mobile service provider , making use of the same dataset that we have used to measure the distribution of call duration in section 2 .",
    "here we evaluate the entropy of the temporal networks formed by the phone - call communication in a typical week - day in order to study how the entropy of temporal social networks is affected by circadian rhythms of human behavior .    for the evaluation of the entropy of temporal social networks we consider a subset of the large dataset of mobile - phone communication .",
    "we selected @xmath131 users who executed at least one call a day during a weeklong period .",
    "we denote by @xmath132 the transition probability that an agent in state @xmath12 ( @xmath133 changes its state at time @xmath25 given that he / she has been in his / her current state for a duration @xmath134 .",
    "the probability @xmath132 can be estimated directly from the data .",
    "therefore , we evaluate the entropy in a typical weekday of the dataset by using the transition probabilities @xmath132 and the definition of entropy of temporal social networks ( readers should refer to the supplementary material of ref .",
    "@xcite for the details ) . in fig .",
    "[ entropyt ] we show the resulting evaluation of entropy in a typical day of our phone - call communication dataset . the entropy of the temporal social network is plotted as a function of time during one typical day .",
    "the mentioned figure shows evidence that the entropy of temporal social networks changes significantly during the day reflecting the circadian rhythms of human behavior .      the adaptability of human behavior is evident when comparing the distribution ofthe duration of phone - calls with the duration of face - to - face interactions . in the framework of the model for mobile - phone interactions described in sec .",
    "[ sec3.2 ] , this adaptability , can be understood , as a possibility to change the exponent @xmath18 in eqs .",
    "( [ f ] ) and ( [ f2 t ] ) regulating the duration of social interactions .",
    "changes in the parameter @xmath18 correspond to different values entropy of the dynamical social networks .",
    "therefore , by modulating the exponent @xmath18 , the human behavior is able to modulate the information encoded in temporal social networks . in order to show the effect on entropy of a variation of the exponent @xmath18 in the dynamics of social interaction networks , we considered the entropy corresponding to the model described in sec .",
    "[ sec3.2 ] as a function of the parameters @xmath18 and @xmath135 modulating the probabilities @xmath136 eqs.([f2 t ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ entropy_network ] we report the entropy @xmath137 of the proposed model a function of @xmath18 and @xmath135 .",
    "the entropy @xmath137 , given by eq.([s_pair2 ] ) , is calculated using the annealed approximation for the solution of the model and assuming the large network limit . in the calculation of the entropy @xmath137",
    "we have taken a network of size @xmath138 with exponential degree distribution of average degree @xmath139 , weight distribution @xmath140 and function @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "our aim in fig . [ entropy_network ] is to show only the effects on the entropy due to the different distributions of duration of contacts and non - interaction periods .",
    "therefore we have normalized the entropy @xmath137 with the entropy @xmath143 of a null model of social interactions in which the duration of groups are poisson distributed but the average time of interaction and non - interaction time are the same as in the model of cell - phone communication ( readers should refer to the supplementary material of ref .",
    "@xcite for more details ) . from fig .",
    "[ entropy_network ] we observe that if we keep @xmath135 constant , the ratio @xmath144 is a decreasing function of the parameter @xmath18 .",
    "this indicates that the broader is the distribution of probability of duration of contacts , the higher is the information encoded in the dynamics of the network .",
    "therefore the heterogeneity in the distribution of duration of contacts and no - interaction periods implies higher level of information in the social network .",
    "the human adaptive behavior by changing the exponent @xmath18 in face - to - face interactions and mobile phone communication effectively changes the entropy of the dynamical network .",
    "the goal of network science is to model , characterize , and predict the behavior of complex networks . here , in this chapter , we have delineated a first step in the characterization of the information encoded in temporal social networks . in particular",
    "we have focused on modelling phenomenologically social interactions on the fast time scale , such a face - to - face interactions and mobile phone communication activity .",
    "moreover , we have defined the entropy of dynamical social networks , which is able to quantify the information present in social network dynamics .",
    "we have found that human social interactions are bursty and adaptive .",
    "indeed , the duration of social contacts can be modulated by the adaptive behavior of humans : while in face - to - face interactions dataset a power - law distribution of duration of contacts has been observed , we have found , from the analysis of a large dataset of mobile - phone communication , that mobile - phone calls are distributed according to a weibull distribution . we have modeled this adaptive behavior by assuming that the dynamics underlying the formation of social contacts implements a reinforcement dynamics according to which the longer an agent has been in a state ( interacting or non - interacting ) the less likely it is that he will change his / her state .",
    "we have used the entropy of dynamical social networks to evaluate the information present in the temporal network of mobile - phone communication , during a typical weekday of activity , showing that the information content encoded in the dynamics of the network changes during a typical day . moreover , we have compared the entropy in a social network with the duration of contacts following a weibull distribution , and with the duration of contacts following a power - law in the framework of the stochastic model proposed for mobile - phone communication .",
    "we have found that a modulation of the statistics of duration of contacts strongly modifies the information contents present in the dynamics of temporal networks .",
    "finally , we conclude that the duration of social contacts in humans has a distribution that strongly deviates from an exponential .",
    "moreover , the data show that human behavior is able to modify the information encoded in social networks dynamics during the day and when facing a new technology such as the mobile - phone communication technology .",
