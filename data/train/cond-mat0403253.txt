    "over the last decades , amorphous silicates containing several wt.@xmath0 of water have attracted the interest of many experimental and theoretical research groups due to its importance in science and technology . e.g. these systems are supposed to play an important role in magmatic flow in the earth crust and have therefore been investigated extensively by many geologists ( for reviews see @xcite ) . in silicate melts ( lava ) , water can be released if temperature and pressure conditions are altered and in that case , the released water molecules assemble in bubbles .",
    "these bubbles can set up pressure for explosive volcanism @xcite .",
    "the microscopic origin of such bubbles is still very poorly understood @xcite and one of the main motivating aspects for our study is to find indicators for such bubble formation . the possible use of water containing silica in fuel cells @xcite and the use of water as defect passivant in semiconductor devices ( and reladed problems ) @xcite and its disturbing presence in optic fibers @xcite underline the technological importance .",
    "+ over the past years pure amorphous silica has been well understood regarding its electronic and structural properties and experimental and simulational data seem to agree well @xcite . in recent studies these investigations",
    "have been extended to the technologically highly important class of sodium silicates @xcite .",
    "new fundamental ideas of the structural properties and the diffusion mechanism of sodium atoms in these melts have been obtained .",
    "+ the impact of water on the structure and dynamics of silica is supposed to be at least as important as the addition of sodium @xcite .",
    "various methods have been used to investigate water speciation and diffusion in a sio@xmath1 network .",
    "nmr , infrared and raman spectroscopy as well as neutron scattering experiments suggest a chemical reaction of molecular water to sioh groups in the melt for low initial water concentrations and a saturation of this reaction if more water is added to the liquid @xcite . in chemical terms it represents a balance of the form @xmath2 that follows the chatelier principle @xcite and which can be shifted to any side by the variation of external conditions like temperature or concentration of one species . the energetics is supposed to be such that a reaction to the right is endothermal and hence at high temperatures sioh is the dominant species @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the mentioned experiments have difficulties to provide reliable quantitative data .",
    "the different fabrication processes of the samples and the overlapping of hydroxyl and water signals in the mentioned spectra are the main reasons for this @xcite .",
    "in - situ measurements in the geologically relevant liquid state are hardly accessible due to elevated temperatures and pressures .",
    "+ computer simulations do usually not encounter these problems since , in principle , they can be done at high temperature and pressure .",
    "nevertheless problems for computer simulations that use inter atomic potentials arise directly from the above reaction : potentials that describe appropriately all possible types of oxygen ( bridging oxygens in the tetrahedral network , oxygens in hydroxyl groups , molecular water oxygens ) have been developed with some success but do not describe the dynamics very well @xcite . here",
    "the great advantage of _ ab initio _",
    "simulations comes into play as the potential and the speciation are found and updated from accurate electronic structure calculations at each molecular dynamics time step .",
    "especially _ ab initio _ car - parrinello simulations turned out to be a powerful tool for investigations of disordered silica and sodium silicate systems @xcite . for a review of previous _ ab initio _ simulated amorphous systems",
    "see @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper we present an equilibrated liquid of water - containing sio@xmath1 and its structural and dynamical properties . these properties will be compared to that of a silica and a sodium silicate melt when possible .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : simdet ] we discuss the used simulation techniques and in section [ sec : res ] we present the structure of the liquid and draw some conclusion on diffusion mechanisms for hydrogen .",
    "conclusions are summarized in the last section .",
    "the molecular dynamics simulations were performed with the car - parrinello code cpmd @xcite at 3000 k and 3500 k. the electronic subsystem was treated with a density functional ( dft ) approach in a generalized gradient approximation using the pbe functional @xcite .",
    "the core electrons of silicon and oxygen atoms were treated in a pseudo potential model using troullier - martins type pseudo potentials @xcite . a plane wave",
    "@xmath3 point expansion with an energy cutoff of 50 ry turned out to be sufficient for an appropriate description of the inter atomic forces .",
    "the 50 ry cutoff with the pbe functional was first tested on the h@xmath1o dimer and on @xmath4-quartz .",
    "these tests showed that e.g. the two sio distances of @xmath4-quartz are equal to 1.624    and to 1.628    independent of the energy cutoff between 50 ry and 100 ry . on the other hand",
    ", we found for the h@xmath1o dimer that the o - o distance , the quantity which is the most sensitive to a change of the cutoff , shows only a variation from 2.925  to 2.950    if the cutoff is decreased from 90 ry to 50 ry .",
    "+ for the sio@xmath1-h@xmath1o liquid we used a simulation box containing 102 atoms ( 30 silicon , 64 oxygen , 8 hydrogen ) corresponding to a concentration of water of 3.84 wt.% .",
    "the simulation box was prepared by starting from an equilibrated liquid silica configuration ( obtained with the effective potential proposed by van beest _",
    "et al _ @xcite ) with 32 sio@xmath1 units .",
    "two randomly chosen silicon atoms were then substituted by four hydrogen atoms each so that the chemical stoichiometry was preserved .",
    "these hydrogen atoms were attached to the oxygen atoms which were formerly bound to the removed silicon atoms .",
    "using cpmd the liquid was subsequently equilibrated at 5000 k for some time and finally cooled down to 3500 k and 3000 k and annealed for roughly 5 ps before recording the trajectories for the present work . since , to our knowledge , densities of water - containing silica systems ( especially in the liquid state ) have not been measured , the volume of the box had to be chosen such that the calculated internal stress of the system had a mean value of zero .",
    "this was the case for a box size of 11.50   and hence a density of 2.05 g/@xmath5 .",
    "comparisons of structural quantities like pair distribution functions , mean square displacements or angle distributions extracted from molecular dynamics simulations performed at 3500 k with a cutoff of 50 ry and of 80 ry did not show differences within the statistical error bars . thus we concluded that the 50 ry cutoff was sufficiently high .",
    "for equilibration , the masses of the ions were all set to 28 a.u .",
    "( the mass of a silicon atom ) .",
    "note that a change of the ionic masses does not affect the structure of the liquid since at equilibrium all structural quantities are independent of the mass .",
    "on the other hand , the increase of the ionic masses ( from 1 to 28 for hydrogen and from 16 to 28 for oxygen ) should increase the energy gap in the electronic structure and allow an increase of the car - parrinello electronic mass and hence the use of a larger time step which thus leads to a faster equilibration .",
    "the equilibration of the system was performed at the two ionic temperatures of 3000 k and 3500 k employing nose - hoover thermostats and an electronic mass of 600 a.u .",
    "( energy @xmath6 time@xmath7 ) at a time step of 4.5 a.u .",
    "( 0.1088 fs ) . at high temperature ,",
    "the electronic gap is too small compared to @xmath8 to ensure the decoupling of the ionic and the electronic degrees of freedom , which is needed to perform car - parrinello dynamics .",
    "the use of thermostats is therefore compulsory . to speed up the equilibration and to perform an efficient canonical sampling ,",
    "one separate nose - hoover thermostat chain for each ionic degree of freedom was used ( known as `` massive '' thermostating @xcite ) .",
    "the electrons were controlled with one single thermostat chain @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , due to the use of thermostats the direct access to dynamical properties is no longer available .",
    "+     mean square displacements of the si , o and h atoms at 3500 k",
    "( solid lines ) and 3000 k ( dashed lines).,width=226 ]    the system was equilibrated at two temperatures ( 3500 k and 3000 k ) until in a log - log plot the averaged mean square displacements ( msd ) of the si atoms showed at long times a slope close to unity .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : msd ] where the mean square displacements ( msd ) of the different atomic species are shown for the 3000 k ( dashed lines ) and the 3500 k ( bold lines ) liquids .",
    "usually msds of viscous liquids are composed of three regions : the ballistic one in which the atoms move without noticing their neighbors and hence a msd that is proportional to @xmath9 .",
    "this ballistic region is followed by a region where the atoms are temporarily confined in a cage made of their nearest neighbors . in this regime ,",
    "the atoms rattle around in the cage without significant displacement , leading to a msd that increases only slowly .",
    "finally the atoms leave this cage and start to show a diffusion motion , i.e. a msd that is proportional to @xmath10 .",
    "the choice of the masses and the thermostats affect also the msd . however , the height of the plateau and the displacement at the onset of the diffusional regime should be independent of the thermostat .",
    "hence , we consider the system to be equilibrated once the diffusional regime is reached which was the case after 4.4 ps at 3500 k and 10.9 ps at 3000 k.    in order to check that the liquids were indeed well equilibrated and that there were no aging effects , the trajectories were cut into three equal parts .",
    "the averaged mean square displacements were then calculated for each part separately and compared to each other . since the three different averaged msd did not show any drift , aging effects can be excluded and equilibration was indeed obtained after the above mentioned times .",
    "all structural quantities were extracted from the beginning of the diffusional part up to the total length of the trajectory ( 4.4 to 12.5 ps at 3500 k and 10.9 to 22.5 ps at 3000 k ) . from fig .",
    "[ fig : msd ] we note that at the end of the 3500 k trajectory the msd is 29.2 @xmath7 , 8.1 @xmath7 , and 5.0 @xmath7 for the h , o and si atoms respectively . at 3000",
    "k the msds were 16.4 @xmath7 , 3.5 @xmath7 and 1.73 @xmath7 . according to the above mentioned equilibration times and the time step of 4.5 a.u .",
    "( 0.1088 fs ) , the numbers of computed time steps were 114900 at 3500 k and 206800 at 3000 k. using a hitachi sr8000 computer , one time step takes 56 s on a single processor .",
    "in this section we present the structural analysis of the liquids at 3000 k and 3500  k. commonly considered quantities like pair distribution functions , bond angle distributions , coordination numbers , @xmath11-species distributions and bridging to non - bridging oxygen ratio will be discussed and , as far as possible , be compared to the data extracted from _ ab initio _ simulated silica and sodium silicate ( ns4 ) melts @xcite .",
    "in particular the comparison to a recently investigated sodium tetrasilicate melt @xcite is highly interesting since the valence shell configuration of the sodium and the hydrogen atoms are equivalent . + in order to analyze the structure with particular attention to the formation and the rupture of the silica network , water molecules and hydroxyl groups , it turns out to be useful to distinguish several types of oxygen atoms : +    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     the average number of o - h bonds in the sio@xmath1-h@xmath1o melts is found to be equal to 8.4 at 3500 k and to 8.1 at 3000 k and is therefore larger than the total number of hydrogen atoms in the system . hence we conclude that intermediate states with two oxygen atoms close to a single hydrogen exist and that they must serve as intermediate states for hydrogen exchange reactions ( process number * 1 . * ) .",
    "+ by counting the number of o - h ruptures along the trajectories and the type of reactants / decay products associated to these ruptures , we are able to show the existence of hydrogen diffusion processes of types * 1 . * and * 2.*. for the following we assumed that an o - h bond was formed if the o - h interatomic distance was larger than the o - h cutoff at step @xmath10 and smaller than the o - h cutoff at step @xmath12 ( @xmath13 being the length of a time step of 0.1088 fs ) .",
    "the nature of the reactant is found by counting , at time @xmath10 , all silicon and hydrogen neighbors ( again in terms of the nearest neighbor cutoff ) of the later o - h oxygen .",
    "a rupture of an o - h bond was assumed to have happened if one h and one o atom had an interatomic distance smaller than the o - h cutoff at time @xmath10 and if their interatomic distance became larger than the o - h cutoff at step @xmath12 , irrespective of whether subsequently the same bond was formed again or not .",
    "the decay product of an o - h rupture is the h donator unit ( without the h atom ) and is found by counting , at step @xmath12 , all silicon and hydrogen neighbors ( again in terms of the nearest neighbor cutoff ) of the former o - h oxygen .",
    "+ at 3500 k the total number of o - h formations and ruptures was 97 and 94 respectively , during the equilibrated part of the trajectory ( 8.1 ps ) . at 3000 k",
    "we found 68 o - h formations and 69 ruptures during the equilibrated part of the trajectory ( 11.6 ps ) .",
    "however , in order to take into account the o - h formations and ruptures that serve for the hydrogen diffusion , we also have to distinguish between the formations and ruptures that give rise to _ hydrogen transfers _ or _",
    "recombinations_. in order to perform this separation between transfers and recombinations it is necessary to relate each decay of an oh bond to a formation of an oh bond .",
    "a hydrogen transfer requires the rupture of one o - h bond and the formation of a _ different _ one , whereas a recombination implies only one bond .",
    "note that the rupture of the first bond will occcur before the formation of the new bond if a transient free hydrogen is formed , or , as in almost every case , after the formation of a new bond which implies the formation of the intermediate state . making this distinction between transfers and recombinations",
    ", we find 28 transfers at 3500 k ( corresponding to a ratio of @xmath14 transfers and 71.2 @xmath15 recombinations ) and 8 transfers at 3000 k ( corresponding to a ratio of @xmath16 transfers and @xmath17 recombinations ) .",
    "the ratio between the number of ruptures involved in a transfer and the total number of ruptures gives the recombination rate .",
    "[ fig : decohtrans]a and b give the percentage of the reactants and decay products for the o - h formations and ruptures including recombinations and figs .",
    "[ fig : decohtrans]c and d the related transfer reactions ( i.e. without recombinations ) . for the transfers , due to the small numbers , the error bars are quite large . at both temperatures ,",
    "the contributions of the si - o dangling bonds are higher for the transfer related ruptures than for the overall ruptures , i.e. transfers and recombinations .",
    "furthermore we recognize from figs .",
    "[ fig : decohtrans]c and d that the si - o dangling bonds and the bos are the main acceptors and rupture products , with almost equal probability .",
    "concerning transfers , the si - o dangling bonds react with a probability of 40 % at 3500  k and 60 % at 3000 k into an sioh group and the sioh group ( o@xmath18 ) decays with a probability of 40 % at 3500 k and 50 % at 3000 k into a si - o dangling bond",
    ". however the corresponding probability that includes recombinations is for both the formation and the decay around 30 % .",
    "this result indicates that the si - o dangling bonds are more involved in the formation and rupture of the o - h bonds when the transfers are considered and the recombinations are taken out .",
    "furthermore it also demonstrates the existence of large vibrations of the h atoms around the o atoms of the si - o dangling bonds and hence the existence of the `` weak '' hydrogen bonds described in sec .",
    "[ sec : rdf ] .",
    "+ the bos serve , with a probability of 50 % at 3500 k and of 40 % at 3000 k , as reactants for a hydrogen transfer leading to a new o - h group ( 60 % including recombinations at both temperatures ) . on the other side ,",
    "the bos serve as products of a hydrogen transfer with a probability of about 50 % , and therefore the participation of the bos to the formation and rupture of the o - h bonds is slightly decreased when transfers are compared to the reactions including recombinations .",
    "+ finally , the o@xmath18 contribute much less to the o - h group formation and decay than the other species , with a probability of about 10 % ( 12 % including recombinations ) at 3500 k and 0 % ( 8 % including recombinations ) at 3000 k. + from fig .",
    "[ fig : decohtrans ] , we deduce that hydrogen transfers involving si - o dangling bonds or bos as reactants as well as decay products dominate with @xmath19 90 % . since these units are associated to o@xmath18 or o3h as initial or final states , they correspond to the hydrogen diffusion process number * 1 . * which means that among the processes * 1 . * and * 2 . * , the former dominates with @xmath19 90 % .",
    "let us now consider the third considered hydrogen diffusion mechanism .",
    "it is associated to the motion of a o - h unit as a whole ( without any o - h rupture ) which can be obtained via the formation and decay of an o3h cluster as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : diffreact3 ] .     typical hydrogen diffusion reaction of process three involving a o3h .",
    "a o - h group is released from an si - o - h ( o@xmath18 ) to a o3h cluster decaying subsequently in another o@xmath18 .",
    "an oversaturated and an unsaturated silicon atoms are subsequent products . , width=529 ]    note that this process requires the presence of `` weak '' si - o bonds , the existence of which was inferred from fig .",
    "[ fig : specosi ] and leads to the formation of threefold and fivefold coordinated silicon atoms . as for the o - h bonds",
    ", we have analyzed the probabilities to find the different reactants and decay products for the o3h clusters formation and rupture . along the equilibrated part of the trajectories ,",
    "we have found 142 formations and 139 ruptures at 3500 k and 104 formations and 103 ruptures at 3000 k. in the case of o3h clusters , the possible reactants and decay products are the oxygen atoms involved in a si - o - h unit ( o@xmath18 ) or a bridging oxygen ( bo ) .",
    "the latter case involves an o - h rupture event whereas the first case does not .",
    "this is the reason why a distinction between _ recombinations _ and _ transfers _ is not easily feasible for these species since the transfered object can either be a hydrogen atom ( as in tab .",
    "[ tab : decay ] ) or an entire o - h group ( as in fig .",
    "[ fig : diffreact3 ] ) .",
    "we hence display the distribution for o3h formations and ruptures including recombinations    in fig .",
    "[ fig : deco3h ] .",
    "there are only very small differences between formation and decay . at both temperatures ,",
    "the o3h clusters form and decay from and into bo and o@xmath18 , with almost the same probabilities .",
    "however at 3000 k , the probability from and into o@xmath18 is slightly preferred with a value of 56 % for o@xmath18 vs. 44 % for bo .",
    "this indicates that the hydrogen diffusion process involving the motion of a o - h group without any o - h bond rupture ( process number * 3 . * ) occurs in the liquids as well .    to conclude the section on the diffusion process",
    ", we analyzed the activation energy for a hydrogen transfer corresponding to the rupture of an o - h bond ( without recombination ) .",
    "we can calculate the activation energy for a hyrogen transfer reaction assuming an arrhenius behavior @xmath20 where the reaction rate @xmath21 is given by a constant @xmath22 and the activation energy @xmath23 .",
    "using the two numbers of o - h ruptures leading to transfers of 28 for 3500 k and 8 for 3000 k we obtain 280 kj / mol ( 2.91 ev ) for the activation energy ( the different lengths of the equilibrated trajectories already taken into account ) .",
    "unfortunately the constant @xmath22 depends explicitly on the transfers per time and can hence not be determined due to the above mentioned problem of the thermostats .",
    "the activation energies for the generation and dissociation of various si@xmath24o@xmath25h@xmath26 molecules in the gas phase have been determined by zachariah _",
    "@xcite with the gaussian _ ab initio _",
    "package @xcite .",
    "et al _ found a value for the activation energy of the formation of osioh from sio@xmath1 and h of 285 kj / mol which compares very well to the above given one of 280 kj / mol for a hydrogen transfer .",
    "we have equilibrated a liquid of silica containing 3.84 wt .",
    "% h@xmath1o at 3500 k and 3000 k using first - principles molecular - dynamics simulations .",
    "we observed that the water is mostly attached to the silica network in the form of si - oh groups .",
    "water molecules or free o - h groups occur only at the highest temperature but are not stable and decay rapidly .",
    "the sio@xmath27 tetrahedra are still the basic network forming units , as in pure silica .",
    "the short range correlation ( i.e. the radial distribution functions ) suggest that the structure of the matrix is as much changed by the addition of water than as by the addition of the same amount of sodium oxide to the liquid .",
    "in contrast to this , the way the modifier cation itself is attached to the matrix seems to be quite different .",
    "the sodium atoms tend to form bonds of ionic character with oxygen , whereas the hydrogen atoms are attached by covalent bonds .",
    "this difference in the bonding character of o - h and o - na could be the reason for the slower diffusion of the hydrogen atoms in liquid silica compared to that of the sodium atoms .",
    "+ the neutron scattering structure factor shows a pronounced prepeak at a wave vector of about 1@xmath28 , i.e. we have evidence for the presence of long range correlations .",
    "the prepeak is even more intense than that for the sodium silicate at the same wave vector transfer .",
    "the origin of this feature in the hydrous liquid seems to be different from that of the sodium silicate , since the partial structure factor for h - h contributes only little .",
    "furthermore , in the hydrous case , the silica matrix itself seems to be modified since the prepeak occurs as well in the partial structure factors for the matrix .",
    "it remains to be investigated whether the prepeak can be observed at ambient temperature .",
    "the data show a shift to higher @xmath29-vectors and a decrease of the intensity at the lowest temperature . + the other experimentally accessible quantity , the q@xmath30 distribution , shows clearly that the o - h groups try to avoid each other .",
    "silicon atoms with two and more si - o dangling bonds or o@xmath18 ( q@xmath30 sites with @xmath31 2 ) are rarely found . despite the strong covalent character of the o - h bond , the o - h units have a high radial mobility and oxygen triclusters have a high tendency to form .",
    "these oxygen triclusters violate the oxygen stoichiometry and the system compensates this violation by the formation of si - o dangling bonds .",
    "+ the dangling bonds and the triclusters constitute mainly the intermediate states for the diffusion mechanism of the hydrogen atoms in the melt . indeed",
    "three possible diffusion mechanisms have been discussed , two of them involving the rupture of an o - h bond .",
    "free water molecules , hydrogen molecules and free hydroxyl groups are not or only rarely found and can not therefore be made responsible for the hydrogen diffusion in the liquid .",
    "+ coming back to one of the motivating questions , the bubble formation , only little can be concluded from this study . on the one hand , it turned out that the o - h groups are very stable species and it requires a certain stoichiometry violation to weaken the o - h bonds ( note that in o - h - o transition units the stoichiometry of the h atom is also violated ) . on the other hand",
    "these bond weakening transition states occur in sufficiently high quantity to assure the hydrogen diffusion .",
    "nevertheless , a clustering of hydrogen and the formation of stable water molecules do not take place , especially at the lower temperature .",
    "if a the formation of bubbles were realized , we would expect a higher signal in the h - h radial distribution function at typical h - h distances found in liquid water ( 2 - 3  ) and perhaps a signal in the q@xmath30 distribution for @xmath31 2 .",
    "hence we do not see evidence for water clustering at the considered temperatures .",
    "we recognize that the influence of temperature , pressure and silicate composition on the bubble formation is not yet investigated and further work of the present kind will be mandatory .",

    "<S> we use _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics simulations to study a sample of liquid silica containing 3.84 wt.@xmath0 h@xmath1o . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , for temperatures of 3000 k and 3500 k , water is almost exclusively dissolved as hydroxyl groups , the silica network is partially broken and static and dynamical properties of the silica network change considerably upon the addition of water . </S>",
    "<S> water molecules or free o - h groups occur only at the highest temperature but are not stable and disintegrate rapidly . </S>",
    "<S> structural properties of this system are compared to those of pure silica and sodium tetrasilicate melts at equivalent temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> these comparisons confirm the picture of a partially broken tetrahedral network in the hydrous liquid and suggest that the structure of the matrix is as much changed by the addition of water than it is by the addition of the same amount ( in mole % ) of sodium oxide . on larger length scales , correlations are qualitatively similar but seem to be more pronounced in the hydrous silica liquid . finally , we study the diffusion mechanisms of the hydrogen atoms in the melt . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that hosi@xmath1 triclusters and sio dangling bonds play a decisive role as intermediate states for the hydrogen diffusion . </S>"
