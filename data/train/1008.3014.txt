    "the soil nematode _ caenorhabditis elegans _ ( _ c .  elegans _ ) is unique in that its 302 neurons and their network have been fully identified @xcite .",
    "in addition , the entire genomic sequence of _ c.  elegans _ has been determined @xcite .",
    "on agar surfaces , the worm lies on one of its two sides and exhibits complex locomotion by crawling forward and backward .",
    "complex locomotion is particularly evident when the worm responds to various types of sensory inputs .",
    "examples of such functional responses include chemotaxis , thermotaxis , and isothermal tracking .",
    "the identification of specific neurons involved in these and other responses has been a topic of intensive research @xcite .",
    "the complex locomotion of _ c.  elegans _ , which underlies functional responses of the worm , accompanies undulations of the entire body with a period of 23 s. in general , trajectories of the worm are not straight but mildly curved .",
    "the worm often turns sharply .",
    "sharp turning events are called under different names , such as reversals , sharp turns , and omega turns , depending on the specific manner of turning . a bout of these sharp turning events is generally called a pirouette , and pirouette is known to improve the efficiency of the worm s locomotion toward chemoattractants ( chemotaxis ) @xcite .",
    "computational modeling has been a useful tool for understanding the locomotion .",
    "most existing computational models assume that sharp turning events , or pirouettes , are the main drive of the functional locomotion behavior of the worm @xcite .    recently",
    ", another mechanism of chemotaxis was discovered @xcite .",
    "it was called weathervane mechanism in @xcite , but more generally called klinotaxis @xcite . in klinotaxis in _ c.  elegans _ , an animal performing a run ( segment of trajectory between adjacent sharp turns",
    "; see materials and methods for definition ) senses the spatial gradient of chemical compounds in the direction lateral to its forward movements and gradually curves toward a higher concentration of the chemicals .",
    "this is distinct from the pirouette mechanism in which pirouettes occur frequently when the concentration of the attractant progressively decreases @xcite , which is a form of klinokinesis @xcite .",
    "klinotaxis suggests that modeling the trajectory of the worm by the combination of pirouettes and straight runs , which do not allow for klinotaxis , may be an oversimplification .",
    "there have been few computational studies of runs , except for some on klinotaxis @xcite and isothermal tracking @xcite .    in this paper , we analyze run data of the locomotion of _ c.  elegans _ in either the absence or presence of a chemoattractant in detail .",
    "our main finding is that the curving angle per unit time exhibits a long - tail distribution ( the precise definition of the curving angle is given in materials and methods ) .",
    "this finding is robust against the influence of the attractant , laser ablation of neurons , and bias in the curving inherent in each worm .",
    "then , we propose a minimal computational model using a correlated random walk , which has been used for modeling the migration of insects and mammals @xcite .",
    "in contrast to these previous cases , the increment of the curving angle can not be modeled as a gaussian distribution , which would arise as a summation of many independent and identically distributed noisy microscopic movements @xcite . a random walk with multiplicative random noise @xcite",

    "we analyzed a subset of the experimental data used in ref .",
    "we briefly explain the experimental setup and the data ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "we used data from two sets of experiments . in one environment",
    ", each worm was placed on an agar plate without nacl .",
    "this data set is the main focus of the present study .",
    "data obtained from 46 worms in this environment were analyzed . in the other environment",
    ", we placed the worms on a grid format plate in which nacl was spotted in a grid pattern and allowed to diffuse on chemotaxis agar as follows .",
    "data obtained from 53 worms in this environment were analyzed .",
    "worms ( _ c .",
    "elegans _ ; bristol strain n2 ) were cultured at 20@xmath8c using a standard technique .",
    "the agar plates contained 10 ml of 1 mm cacl@xmath9 , 1 mm mgso@xmath10 , 5 mm potassium phosphate , ph 6.0 , and 2% agar in a 9-cm - diameter plastic dish . for assays with nacl ( chemotaxis assays ) ,",
    "the agar plates were prepared as follows : 1 @xmath11 m each of 200 mm nacl in a low - salt buffer was spotted onto 12 points in a grid , which were spaced 2 cm apart ; the positions of the centers of the spots were @xmath12 = ( 10 mm , 10 mm ) , ( 10 mm , @xmath1310 mm ) , ( @xmath1310 mm , 10 mm ) , and so on ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the assay plates were left for 1 h after spotting the nacl - containing buffer .    in the tracking system , images were captured and analyzed to locate the centroid of the worm .",
    "images were captured at intervals 0.40.6 s. each worm was tracked for 20 min after being placed on the agar plate .",
    "tracking data were discarded when a worm was considered to be immobile during an entire recording session .      a sample trajectory of a worm in the two - dimensional plane is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_def_various_quantities]a .",
    "the symbols represent the location at each image capture .",
    "we discard sharp turns ( gray squares ) defined in the following and analyze the rest of the data ( dark circles ) . to this end , we define the displacement vector as the difference between the coordinate observed at a time point and that observed at the previous time point ( fig .  [ fig_def_various_quantities]b ) .",
    "the angle from the @xmath14-axis to the displacement vector at time @xmath15 measured clockwise is denoted as @xmath16 .",
    "following @xcite , we define the curving rate as @xmath17 this definition is slightly different from that in @xcite , in which the curving rate is defined by the derivative of @xmath18 with respect to the distance traveled .",
    "the determination of a curving rate involves three successive data points .",
    "the speed in addition to the curving rate is required to specify the locomotion of the worm .",
    "although the speed of the worm varies with time , we neglect these variations , as in the case of previous modeling studies @xcite    we remove sharp turns as follows ( fig .",
    "[ fig_def_various_quantities]c ) .",
    "a sharp turn is defined as an event in which @xmath19 is satisfied . a sharp turn segment ( shaded area in fig .",
    "[ fig_def_various_quantities]c ) is defined as the segment of the trajectory within 0.1 mm from a sharp turn event .",
    "the length of the trajectory is measured by the accumulated length of the piecewise linear path connecting the two - dimensional coordinates .",
    "we remove all the sharp turn segments and analyze the rest of the data , which we call the run data .",
    "a run is a section of the trajectory between two successive sharp turn segments .",
    "a single worm generates a trajectory that generally includes multiple runs .",
    "our data were recorded at irregular intervals . to avoid the technical complication of calculating the autocorrelation of the curving rate in this situation",
    ", we proceed as follows .",
    "we first generate a continuous trajectory on the two - dimensional plate from a sequence of the coordinates of the worm by using the third spline interpolation ( numerically implemented using gnu scientific library ) .",
    "then , we resample discrete time series of the coordinates from the interpolated continuous trajectory every 0.3 s. next , we detect sharp turns of the resampled trajectory and exclude the sharp turn segments . @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 denote the @xmath23th curving rate in the @xmath24th run of the @xmath25th worm ( @xmath26 ) , length of the @xmath24th run of the @xmath25th worm , and number of runs of the @xmath25th worm , respectively .",
    "we combine all the runs from all the worms to calculate a single autocorrelation function because reliably calculating the autocorrelation necessitates many data points .",
    "the number of data points used for calculating the autocorrelation function with lag @xmath27 is given by @xmath28 the average curving rate for the data points that are included in the calculation of the two - point correlation function with lag @xmath27 is equal to @xmath29 the autocorrelation function with lag @xmath27 ( i.e. , @xmath30 s ) , denoted by @xmath31 , is defined by @xmath32 note that @xmath33 .",
    "we verified that the interpolation does not significantly affect the trajectory or the distributions of @xmath34 .",
    "we employed the spline interpolation only for calculating the autocorrelation function .",
    "when nacl is present , the concentration of nacl created by a single spot of nacl was evaluated by the solution of the diffusion equation : @xmath35 , where @xmath36 ( mm ) is the amount of nacl spotted , @xmath37 ( mm@xmath38/s ) is the diffusion constant of nacl , @xmath39 ( mm ) is the thickness of the plate , @xmath40 is the time ( in seconds ) after spotting , and @xmath41 is the distance ( in millimeters ) from the spot .",
    "the summation of the estimated nacl concentration based on 12 nacl spots defines the total concentration of nacl , which we denote by @xmath42 .",
    "to examine klinotaxis , we compute the gradient of the concentration of nacl along two directions .",
    "one is the forward direction , which is parallel to the displacement vector .",
    "the corresponding gradient is denoted by @xmath43 .",
    "the other is the lateral direction , which is perpendicular to the forward direction .",
    "the corresponding gradient is denoted by @xmath44 .",
    "we define @xmath44 to be positive if @xmath42 on the right side of the worm , when viewed from above , is larger than that on the left side .",
    "we analyze runs from two sets of experiments from different environments : ones with and without a gradient of the nacl concentration ( nacl gradient for short ) .",
    "we mainly focus on the data recorded in the absence of an nacl gradient .    a time series of the curving rate @xmath34 of a worm during a run is shown in fig .  [ fig phi no - nacl]a .",
    "@xmath34 has a periodic component and accompanies large fluctuations .",
    "periodic behavior with a period of approximately 3 s is derived from the body undulation .",

    "the distribution of @xmath34 for a typical worm is indicated by the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig phi no - nacl]c .",
    "the distribution has two peaks owing to the oscillatory undulation .",
    "the significance of the two peaks varies between worms and runs . when we combine the data of all the worms , the distribution of @xmath34 is unimodal ( solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig phi no - nacl]c ) , which reflects the heterogeneity of the worms . to inspect the tails of the distribution",
    ", we divide the samples into a group with @xmath45 and that with @xmath46 . for a single worm , the cumulative distributions of @xmath47 , defined in the present study as the fraction of samples among all the samples such that the absolute value is larger than @xmath47 ,",
    "are separately shown for the two groups in fig .",
    "[ fig phi no - nacl]d . remarkably , both two cumulative distributions of @xmath34 have long tails .",
    "the long tails are also evident when we combine the data of all the worms ( fig .",
    "[ fig phi no - nacl]d ) .",
    "the mean of @xmath34 for the combined data is almost equal to zero , and the standard deviation of @xmath34 is equal to @xmath48 .",
    "the cumulative distribution of the gaussian distribution with mean zero and standard deviation 15.8 is indicated by the dot - dashed line in fig .  [ fig phi no - nacl]d .",
    "the distribution of @xmath34 is not accurately fitted by the gaussian distribution because of the long tail present in the experimental data .",
    "a manual power - law fit to the tail of the cumulative distribution of @xmath47 yields the power law @xmath49 ( i.e. , @xmath50 for the original distribution ) .",
    "the exponent and the significance of the power law depend on the worm and on the sign of @xmath34 .",
    "nevertheless , for all the data examined , the tail is much longer than that of the gaussian distribution of the same value of the standard deviation .    to show that the observed long - tail distribution of @xmath34 is not a byproduct , we perform a few tests .",
    "first , the long tail is not caused by sharp turns .",
    "if we include the sharp turns in the analysis , we find a peak at a large value of @xmath34 ( fig .",
    "[ fig phi no - nacl]e ) that is distinct from the long tail observed in the run data . for visibility ,",
    "the original distributions of @xmath47 , not the cumulative ones as in other similar figures , are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig phi no - nacl]e .",
    "second , the long tail is not caused by the immobility of the worm .",
    "the mean of @xmath47 is plotted against the instantaneous speed of the worm in fig .",
    "[ fig : real cumulative phi for verification]a .",
    "@xmath47 tends to be large when the worm runs slowly .",
    "excluding the values of @xmath34 for which the instantaneous speed of the worm is small , i.e. , less than 0.05 mm / s , preserves the long - tail distribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig : real cumulative phi for verification]b ) .",
    "third , the occurrence of a large value of @xmath47 is not restricted to periods near sharp turns .",
    "we recover the long - tail distribution even if we exclude a significant length of run ( i.e. , 6 s ) before and after sharp turns ( fig .",
    "[ fig : real cumulative phi for verification]c ) .    in the presence of an nacl gradient",
    ", the run is chiefly characterized by klinotaxis @xcite , according to which the worm senses the lateral gradient of nacl and gradually curves toward the direction in which the nacl concentration increases .",
    "we quantified klinotaxis by following the methods developed in @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig_weathervane_phi]a , the mean of @xmath34 of single worms is plotted against the values of the lateral and forward gradients of nacl concentration .",
    "the error bars in the figure represent the standard deviations calculated based on the mean values of @xmath34 from different worms .",
    "klinotaxis is evident from the positive correlation between @xmath34 and the lateral nacl gradient ( i.e. , @xmath51 ) . during the run",
    ", the worm tends to curve its body to encounter a higher concentration of the nacl .",
    "note that @xmath34 and the forward nacl gradient ( i.e. , @xmath52 ) are almost uncorrelated .",
    "figures  [ fig_weathervane_phi]b and c indicate that the standard deviation and the skewness of @xmath34 for single worms are insensitive to both the lateral and forward nacl gradients . the dependence of the skewness on the nacl gradient ( fig .",
    "[ fig_weathervane_phi]c ) , which was found previously @xcite , does exist but is negligible in the present analysis .",
    "therefore , we expect that the nacl gradient effectively shifts the distribution of @xmath34 by an amount proportional to the lateral nacl gradient but hardly changes the shape of the distribution of @xmath34 .",
    "sample distributions of @xmath34 conditioned by two ranges of @xmath51 values are compared in fig .",
    "[ fig_weathervane_phi]d . they do not differ considerably except for translation , as expected .",
    "figure  [ fig_weathervane_phi ] suggests that klinotaxis translates the distribution of @xmath34 by a small amount and does not affect the long tails . a sample trajectory and the distributions of @xmath34 obtained from the experiments in the presence of an nacl gradient are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig phi with nacl ] .",
    "the results are qualitatively similar to those obtained from the experiments in the absence of an nacl gradient ( fig .",
    "[ fig phi no - nacl ] ) .",
    "we conclude that the long - tail behavior of the run is robustly observed both in the absence and presence of an nacl gradient .",
    "we developed a phenomenological model of the run on the basis of the correlated random walk @xcite .",
    "we indexed the discrete time by @xmath24 , i.e. , @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is a time interval .",
    "we modeled the reorientation of the worm at time @xmath15 by @xmath55 where @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 are the amplitude , phase , and instantaneous period of undulation , respectively .",
    "@xmath59 is the noise inherent at time @xmath15 .",
    "if @xmath59 were independent gaussian noise , as is the case for the standard correlated random walk , the long - tail behavior of the curving rate is not reproduced .",
    "therefore , we assumed multiplicative noise @xmath59 @xcite , such that @xmath60 where @xmath61 ; @xmath62 is chosen from the normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation @xmath63 .",
    "the procedure for fitting the parameter values is described in appendix i.    the assumption of random multiplicative noise is based on the premise that a large movement accompanies a proportionally large noise , which is known for the arm and hand movements of humans @xcite . to examine the plausibility of this assumption",
    ", we consider an alternative model in which long - tail noise is directly applied in each time step . if @xmath59 in eq .",
    "[ eq : phi rmp no - nacl ] is the independent long - tail noise , the long - tail distribution of @xmath64 is produced . by allowing an autoregressive ( ar ) term with which to calibrate the autocorrelation of @xmath64 , we define the alternative model by replacing eq .",
    "[ eq : phi rmp no - nacl ] by @xmath65 , where @xmath66 .",
    "note that @xmath59 is a long - tail noise ; the ar model with the gaussian @xmath59 , as is usually assumed , does not yield the long - tail distribution of @xmath64 irrespective of the parameter values and the number of autoregressive terms on the right - hand side of the model .",
    "we compare the two models by measuring @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the average over @xmath24 for a given @xmath69 .",
    "for the alternative long - tail noise model , we obtain @xmath70 .",
    "@xmath59 is identically distributed , and its typical magnitude is much larger than that of the sinusoidal undulation ( i.e. , @xmath71 ) under the fitted parameter values .",
    "therefore , @xmath72 would depend little on @xmath69 and serve as an estimate of the magnitude of the noise for a proper value of @xmath73 .",
    "in contrast , for our multiplicative noise model , eqs .  [ eq : phi rmp no - nacl ] and [ eq_noise_rmp ] imply that @xmath74 increases with @xmath69 .",
    "it turns out for any @xmath73 that @xmath74 and @xmath69 are positively correlated for both the experimental data ( fig .",
    "[ fig : validate rmp]a ) and the multiplicative noise model ( fig .",

    "this is not the case for the long - tail noise model with @xmath75 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : validate rmp]b ) or any other values of @xmath73 ; the plots for other values of @xmath73 almost completely overlap with those for @xmath75 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : validate rmp]b",
    ". therefore , at least some components of the locomotion are likely to be explained by the multiplicative noise .",
    "we have verified that the addition of the ar terms to the multiplicative noise model little affects the behavior of the model except for some changes in the autocorrelation of @xmath64 .    a sample trajectory obtained from the numerical simulations of the multiplicative noise model",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_simu_dist]a , which is qualitatively similar to that shown in fig .",

    "the strong periodicity results from the fact that the undulation period @xmath58 is fixed .",
    "the distribution of @xmath34 and its long tail obtained from the numerical simulations roughly resemble those of the experimental data ( fig .",

    "the undulation period of the experimental data fluctuates . to incorporate this factor",

    "this modification of the model yielded the exponential decay in the autocorrelation function , as found in the experimental data ( dash - dotted line labeled `` fluctuating @xmath58 '' in fig .",
    "[ fig_simu_dist]b ) .",
    "the modified model does not quantitatively agree with the autocorrelation function of the experimental data , partly because the fluctuation in @xmath58 is crudely implemented .",

    "[ fig_weathervane_phi ] ) .",

    "we speculate that the long - tail behavior reflects intrinsic properties of the neural circuit for head oscillation , which is currently unidentified .",
