    "epidemic spreading phenomena are ubiquitous in nature and society .",
    "examples include the spreading of infectious diseases within a population , the spreading of computer viruses on the internet , and the propagation of information in society .",
    "understanding and modelling the dynamics of such events can have significant practical impact on health care , technology and the economy .",
    "various spreading mechanisms have been studied @xcite .",
    "the two most common mechanisms are _ local spreading _",
    ", where infected nodes only infect a limited subset of target nodes @xcite ; and _ global spreading _ , where nodes are fully - mixed such that an infected node can infect any other node @xcite . in reality , many epidemics use _ hybrid spreading _ , which involves a combination of two or more spreading mechanisms .",
    "for example the computer worms conficker @xcite and code - red @xcite can send probing packets to targeted computers in the local network or to any randomly chosen computers on the internet .",
    "early relevant studies investigated epidemics spreading in populations whose nodes mix at both local and global levels ( `` two levels of mixing '' ) @xcite .",
    "these early studies @xcite did not incorporate the structure of the local spreading network , assuming both local and global spreading are fully - mixed . since the introduction of network based epidemic analysis @xcite ,",
    "hybrid epidemics have been studied in structured populations @xcite , in structured households @xcite , and by considering networked epidemic spreading with `` two levels of mixing '' @xcite . a number of studies @xcite have also considered epidemics in metapopulations , which consist of a number of weakly connected subpopulations",
    ". the studies of epidemics in clustered networks @xcite are also relevant .",
    "much prior work on hybrid epidemics has focused on the impact of a network s structure on spreading .",
    "most previous studies were about what we call the _ non - critically _ hybrid epidemics where a combination of multiple mechanisms is not a necessary condition for an epidemic outbreak . in this case , using a fixed total spreading effort , a hybrid epidemic will always be less infectious than an epidemic using only the more infectious one of the two spreading mechanisms @xcite . however , many real examples of hybrid epidemics suggest the existence of _ critically _ hybrid epidemics where a mixture of spreading mechanisms may be more infectious than using only one mechanism .    in this paper",
    "we investigate whether , and if so when , hybrid epidemics spread more widely than single - mechanism epidemics .",
    "we propose a mathematical framework for studying hybrid epidemics and focus on exploring the optimum balance between local and global spreading in order to maximize outbreak size .",
    "we demonstrate that hybrid epidemics can cause larger outbreaks in a metapopulation than a single spreading mechanism .",
    "our results suggest that it is possible to combine two spreading mechanisms , each with a limited potential to cause an epidemic , to produce a highly effective spreading process .",
    "furthermore , we can identify an optimal tradeoff between local and global mechanisms that enables a hybrid epidemic to cause the largest outbreak . manipulating the balance between local and global spreading may provide a way to improve strategies for disseminating information , but also a way to estimate the largest outbreak of a hybrid epidemic which can pose serious threats to internet security .",
    "here we introduce a model for hybrid epidemics in a _ metapopulation _ , which consists of a number of subpopulations .",
    "each subpopulation is a collection of densely or strongly connected nodes , whereas nodes from different subpopulations are weakly connected . as illustrated in figure[fig - l - g ] , our model considers two spreading mechanisms : 1 ) local spreading where an infected node can infect nodes in its subpopulation and 2 ) global spreading , where an infected node can infect all nodes in the metapopulation . in our model",
    "each subpopulation for local spreading can be either fully - mixed or a network . for mathematical convenience , we describe each subpopulation as a network and represent a fully - mixed subpopulation as a fully connected network .",
    "note that our definition of metapopulation is different from the classical metapopulation defined in ecology where subpopulations are connected via flows of agents @xcite .",
    "hybrid epidemic spreading in a metapopulation . at each time step",
    ", an infected node has a fixed total spreading effort which must be allocated between local spreading and global spreading .",
    "the proportion of spreading effort spent in local spreading is @xmath0 and that in global spreading is @xmath1 .",
    "local spreading occurs between infected and susceptible nodes that are connected in individual subpopulations ; global spreading happens between an infected node and any susceptible node in the metapopulation.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    our model considers hybrid epidemics in which at each time step , an infected node has a fixed total spreading effort which must be allocated between the two spreading mechanisms . let the hybrid tradeoff , @xmath0 , represent the proportion of spreading effort spent in local spreading .",
    "the proportion of global spreading effort is @xmath1 .",
    "a tunable @xmath0 enables us to investigate the interaction and the joint impact of the two spreading mechanisms on epidemic dynamics , ranging from a completely local spreading scenario ( with @xmath2 ) to a completely global spreading scenario ( with @xmath3 ) .",
    "for example computer worms like conficker @xcite and code - red @xcite can conduct both local and global probes but the average total number of probes in a time unit is fixed .",
    "we consider the hybrid epidemic spreading in terms of the susceptible - infected - recovered ( sir ) model @xcite , where each node is in one of three states : _ susceptible _ ( s ) , _ infected _",
    "( i ) , and _ recovered _ ( r ) . at each time step , each infected node spreads both locally and globally ; it infects 1 ) each directly connected nodes in the same subpopulation with rate @xmath4 and 2 ) each susceptible node in the metapopulation with rate @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath6 is the local infection rate when all spreading effort is local ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "and @xmath7 is the global infection rate when all spreading effort is global ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "each infected node recovers at a rate @xmath8 , and then remains permanently in the recovered state .",
    "a node can infect other nodes and then recover in the same time step .",
    "before we analyse hybrid spreading in a metapopulation , we study a relatively simple case where the epidemic process takes place in a _ single population_. that is , there is only one population , where local spreading is via direct connections on a network structure and global spreading can reach any node in the population .",
    "here we extend the system in @xcite for the analysis .",
    "the system in @xcite was proposed to analyse single - mechanism based epidemics for the continuous time case . here",
    "we extend the system to analyse 1 ) hybrid epidemics , and 2 ) for the discrete time case .",
    "we calculate the probability that a random test node @xmath9 is in each state : susceptible @xmath10 , infected @xmath11 , and recovered @xmath12 .",
    "we denote @xmath13 as the probability that a node has degree ( i.e. number of neighbours ) @xmath14 .",

    "that is the fixed point @xmath54 turns from stable to unstable when @xmath64 changes from negative to positive .",
    "a more rigorous analysis would need to consider the fact that when a small amount of disease is introduced , the fixed point at @xmath54 is moved slightly .",

    "this is an acceptable assumption when the metapopulation has a larger number of subpopulations . under these conditions ,",
    "hybrid spreading within @xmath107 is the same as spreading in a single - population , which has been analysed in previous sections .",
    "to predict @xmath105 , we first analyse the expected number of nodes outside @xmath107 that will be infected by @xmath107 .",

    "when the recovery rate is higher , nodes remain infectious for shorter times . in this case , in order to achieve the maximum epidemic outbreak , more local infection is favoured , since this will allow an infected subpopulation to remain infected for longer , and hence increase the probability of infecting other subpopulations before it recovers .",

    "this is in agreement with the intuition that a low recovery rate will favour any type of epidemic spreading . for a fixed @xmath8 ,",
    "@xmath112 increases with @xmath6 .",
    "an increased infection rate of local spreading will obviously increase the reproductive number , if other parameters are kept constant , but the effect is much smaller than that of changing the recovery rate , because global spreading maintains the reproductive number when local spreading falls to low values .",
    "figure[fig - mamrc]a shows a clear phase shift between areas where an epidemic occurs ( the coloured area ) and areas where it does not ( the white area towards the top - left corner ) .",

    "infection across subpopulations can only be achieved by global spreading .",

    "hybrid spreading , the propagation of infectious agents using two or more alternative mechanisms , is a common feature of many real world epidemics . widespread epidemics ( e.g. computer worms ) typically spread efficiently by local spreading through connections within a subpopulation , but also use global spreading to probe distant targets usually with much lower infectivity . in many cases ,",
    "the amount of resources ( e.g. time , energy or money ) which an infectious agent can devote to each mode of propagation is limited .",
    "this study focuses on the tradeoff between local and global spreading , and the effect of this tradeoff on the outbreak of an epidemic .",
    "we develop a theoretical framework for investigating the relationships between @xmath0 , the relative weight given to each spreading mechanisms , and the other epidemic properties .",
    "these properties include epidemic infectivity , subpopulation structure , epidemic threshold , and population reproduction number .",
    "the predictions of the theoretical model agree well with stochastic simulation results , both in single populations and in metapopulations .",
    "our analysis shows that epidemics spreading in a metapopulation may be critically hybrid epidemics where a combination of the two spreading mechanisms is essential for an outbreak and neither completely local spreading nor completely global spreading can allow epidemics to propagate successfully .",
    "our study reveals that , in metapopulations , there exists an optimal tradeoff between global and local spreading , and provides a way to calculate this optimum given information on other epidemic parameters .",
    "these results are supported by our recent study @xcite on measurement data of the internet worm conficker @xcite .",
    "the above results are of practical relevance when the total amount of time or capacity that is allocated to spreading is limited by some resource constraint .",
    "for example , the total probing frequency of computer worms is often capped at a low rate to prevent them from being detected by anti - virus software .",
    "furthermore , other epidemic parameters , such as local or global infection rates are difficult to change because they derive from inherent properties of the infectious agent .",
    "for example it would be difficult to increase the global infection rate of an internet worm .",
    "the tradeoff between different types of spreading therefore becomes a key parameter in terms of design strategy , which can be manipulated to maximise outbreak size .",
    "the consideration of hybrid spreading mechanisms also has some interesting implications for strategies for protecting against the spread of epidemics .",
    "it is clear from both theoretical considerations and simulations that epidemics can spread with extremely low global infection rates ( far below individual recovery rates ) , provided there is efficient local infection .",
    "such conditions are common for both cyber epidemics ( as computers within infected local networks tend to be more vulnerable to infection @xcite ) and in infectious disease epidemics , where contacts between family or community members are often much closer and more frequent than the overall population .",
    "protection strategies which target local networks collectively ( for example intensive local vaccination around individual disease incidents , as was used in the final stages of smallpox eradication @xcite ) may therefore be a key element of future strategies to control future mixed spreading epidemics .    in conclusion ,",
    "our study highlights the importance of the tradeoff between local and global spreading , and manipulation of this tradeoff may provide a way to improve strategies for spreading , but also a way to estimate the worst outcome ( i.e. largest outbreak ) of hybrid epidemics which can pose serious threats to internet security .",
    "here we use newman s method @xcite to obtain the threshold condition for the local spreading .",
    "firstly we need to calculate the `` transmissibility '' @xmath119 which is the average probability that an epidemic is transmitted between two connected nodes , of which one is infected and the other is susceptible . according to @xcite , for the discrete time case @xmath119 can be calculated as @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the time steps that an infected node remains infected , @xmath138 and @xmath139 respectively are the probability distribution of @xmath137 and @xmath6 . for the model in this paper",
    ", @xmath6 is a constant and @xmath140 , in which @xmath141 is the probability that an infected node has not recovered until @xmath142 steps after infection , and @xmath8 is the probability that the node recovers at the @xmath137th step after infection . also for the model in this paper , each infected node",
    "at least remains infected for @xmath143 time step .",
    "so that @xmath119 for our model can be obtained as @xmath144 according to @xcite the epidemic threshold for completely local spreading is @xmath145 i.e. @xmath70>1 $ ] .",
    "this is the same as the epidemic threshold for completely local spreading obtained in this paper .",
    "note that treating each edge as having this value of @xmath119 independently will lead to the correct epidemic threshold and final size calculation , but there are further discussions on its correctness in calculating the infection probabilities @xcite .",
    "random networks used in all simulations have a poisson degree distribution and they are generated by the erds - rnyi ( er ) model @xcite with the average degree of 5 .",
    "scale - free networks used in all simulations have a power - law degree distribution @xmath95 and they are generated by the configuration model @xcite with the minimum degree @xmath96 .",
