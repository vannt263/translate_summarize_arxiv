    "electrons moving freely on the surface distribute themselves in a minimal energy configuration , and many articles have been devoted to finding the minimal energy configurations and the asymptotic of the minimal energy .",
    "the question studied in this article is the extent to which zeros of random polynomials of degree @xmath0 tend to resemble minimal energy configurations of n points .",
    "zeros of random polynomials in complex dimension one repel and like minimal energy configurations tend to stay @xmath11 apart .",
    "our main results show that the average energy of such random zeros is of the same order of magnitude as that of minimal energy configurations .",
    "to state our results , we need some notation . throughout the article we identify polynomials of degree @xmath0 with holomorphic sections @xmath12 of the @xmath0th power of the hyperplane section bundle over the complex projective line @xmath13 .",
    "our methods apply equally to holomorphic sections @xmath14 of powers of a positive holomorphic line bundle @xmath15 over any compact riemann surface.thus , in addition to studying zeros of polynomials , we study zeros of random theta functions over a riemann surface of genus one , and zeros of random holomorphic k - differentials over a surface of higher genus . moreover",
    ", our results apply to general k@xmath16hler metrics @xmath5 on these riemann surfaces .",
    "as recalled in @xmath17 , a choice of hermitian metric on l determines an inner product on @xmath18 and then a gaussian measure @xmath19 on this spaces . roughly speaking ,",
    "a random section @xmath20 is expressed in terms of an orthonormal basis @xmath21 of @xmath18 as @xmath22 where the @xmath23 are independent complex normal gaussian random variables .",

    "we define @xmath40 to be the expected ( average ) value of the energy of the zeros of gaussian random sections chosen from the ensemble @xmath41 by @xmath42 here @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the zeros of @xmath29 and @xmath45 .",

    "then the expected ( average ) energy is satisfies :    let @xmath48 be a positive hermitian line bundle on @xmath4 with @xmath49 , @xmath50 is the curvature form and @xmath51 gives @xmath4 a riemannian volume form . we assume the chern class of @xmath52 , @xmath53",

    "we notice that elkies normalization of green s function is @xmath60 which is negative near the diagonal . while , our normalization for green s function @xmath61 is positive near the diagonal",
    ". then we can rewrite elkies result @xmath62    1 .",
    "we see that the leading order term in equation ( [ hr ] ) is the same as the one in equation ( [ main theorem ] ) .",
    "it means that the probability that the energy is above the minimum goes to zero as @xmath63 , i.e. @xmath64 where @xmath65 which is the minimum of the energy . above formula",
    "is not hard to verify . if @xmath66 and @xmath67 , then we get + @xmath68 + so we have @xmath69 2 .",
    "our expect average of green s function energy is scale metric invariant , that is , if we rescale the metric @xmath70 , then our result ( [ main theorem ] ) does nt change . when @xmath70 , @xmath71 operator becomes @xmath72 , as we discuss in  2.5 , @xmath73 is the kernel of @xmath74 , then @xmath75 as @xmath70 . on the other side , @xmath76 as @xmath70 , therefore , @xmath73 does nt change as @xmath70 .",
    "the leading term order term is independent of @xmath5 and @xmath25 .",
    "we define the green s function @xmath77 to be positive near the diagonal and the average is negative .",
    "then we conclude that the off diagonal part dominates the energy .    1 .",
    "consider @xmath13 with the fubini - study metric @xmath5 , let @xmath78 be a positive hermitian line bundle on @xmath13 with @xmath79 , @xmath50 is the curvature form .",
    "we recall equation ( 2 ) and have expected s - energy : * when @xmath80 + @xmath81 * when @xmath82 @xmath83 * when @xmath84 @xmath85 we will discuss the constant @xmath86 in the remark at the end of this section .",
    "2 .   under the same condition as above",
    ", we recall equation ( 3 ) and have expected logarithmic energy : @xmath87    let us compare our results on average energy to the prior results on minimal energy . for @xmath88energy case , saff - kuijilaars in [ ks ] identified @xmath13 as @xmath89 and considered the energy @xmath90 not on @xmath13 and @xmath91 is the chordal distance of @xmath32 .",
    "they investigated the energy @xmath92 .",
    "moreover , they define the minimal @xmath88energy for @xmath0 points on the sphere @xmath93    it was proved by saff - kuijlaars that when @xmath80 , then    @xmath94    and when @xmath95 , then @xmath96 @xmath97 . and",

    "so by the equations ( [ z2 ] ) and ( [ k2 ] ) , we see that when @xmath80 the leading order term of the expected average of energy is the same as the one in minimum energy .",
    "so is the 0-energy case . * in equation ( [ z4 ] ) , we ca nt figure out the constant precisely .",
    "actually it is a conjecture in [ ks ] .",
    "since in the green s function energy , 2-energy and 0-energy , all the leading order terms of expected average are the same as the one in minimum energy , this paper probably offers a method to solve the conjecture",
    ". it will be discussed more after the proof of theorem 1.2(1 ) .    an additional motivation to study energies of random zeros",
    "is that there are examples of numerical integration over the riemann surface . in numerical integration , one integrates a function with respect to a probability measure @xmath107 by generation @xmath0 random points from the ensemble @xmath108 and averaging over the points . in this article , we generate n random points from @xmath109 by taking the zeros of a random polynomial .",
