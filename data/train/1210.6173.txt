    "aperiodic x - ray fluctuations have been observed from both galactic black hole binaries ( bhbs ) and active galactic nuclei ( agns ) ( uttley et al . 2005 ; mchardy et al .",
    "the power spectral density ( psd ) of such variability is generally modeled with a power law , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the power at frequency @xmath2 , and @xmath3 varies with frequency . in the soft state ,",
    "the psds of both bhbs and agns have a steep slope with @xmath4 at high frequencies , flatting to a shallow slope with @xmath5 below a bend frequency @xmath6 , which is typically around @xmath7 for bhbs ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the psds in the hard state are more complex .",
    "the origin of variability is not well understood yet .",
    "however , it is highly tempting to relate this variability to the magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence , which is believed to drive the accretion process ( @xcite ) .",
    "some works followed this path through numerical simulation , and typically used proxies for the radiation rather than a direct measure of luminosity ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it remains uncertain whether the proxies for radiation are appropriate to describe the luminosity fluctuations . in the present work",
    ", we will show that the variability of magnetic energy ( stress ) of the standard thin disk is different from that of radiation for short time - scale fluctuations .",
    "recently , shearing box simulations of stratified magnetorotational turbulence ( @xcite ) showed that fluctuations in the magnetic energy ( stress ) lead those in the radiation energy with roughly a thermal time - scale , and a correlation is found between the stress and total pressure .",
    "moreover , the disk is found to be thermally stable , which is , however , in conflict with the disk theory ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the discrepancy reveals that the correlation found in the simulation may be different from the @xmath8-prescription .",
    "for example , such a correlation may be related to the energy equation or result from the feedback from pressure to stress , which is not in the form of the standard @xmath8-prescription ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "since the dissipation of magnetic energy will heat the gas of accretion flow , the perturbations in the magnetic energy will produce corresponding fluctuations in the internal energy and therefore in the pressure .",
    "then , there should exist a correlation and delay between the stress and the pressure . in the present work , based on the energy equation",
    ", we will investigate the relationship between fluctuations of the viscous heating and the inducing fluctuations of the radiative cooling .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the relationship of fluctuations of the viscous heating and the inducing fluctuations of the radiative cooling is derived in section  2 .",
    "a comparison of analysis and simulation is presented in section  3 .",
    "conclusions and discussion are made in section  4 .",
    "in the context of standard thin accretion disk ( @xcite ) , the vertically integrated energy equation in cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 takes the form ( e.g. , @xcite ) : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the vertical height of the disk , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the surface density and the vertically integrated pressure , respectively .",
    "the gas internal energy @xmath16 and the radiative cooling rate @xmath17 per unit area are expressed as @xmath18 \\pi \\ , \\ ] ] @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are respectively the internal energy of radiation and gas , @xmath22 is defined as the ratio of the gas to the total pressure , i.e. , @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the ratio of specific heating , and @xmath25 is the temperature on the equatorial plane of the disk .",
    "the opacity @xmath26 is generally dominated by the electron scattering ( @xmath27 ) in radiation - pressure - dominated accretion disks , where @xmath26 can be regarded as a constant . on the other hand ,",
    "if the opacity is dominated by the free - free absorption ( @xmath28 ) , @xmath26 will vary with the temperature and the density .",
    "the viscous heating @xmath29 is due to the dissipation of magnetic energy and turbulent kinetic energy in magnetoturbulent disks , and is dominated by the dissipation of magnetic energy in simulations ( @xcite )",
    ".    for the fluctuations with a time - scale less than the viscous time - scale , the variation of @xmath30 can be neglected , and equation  ( [ eenergyinitial ] ) is therefore simplified as @xmath31 in order to study the induced fluctuations of radiative cooling , we adopt the vertical hydrostatic equilibrium @xmath32 and the equation of state , which can be approximately expressed as @xmath33      we use the subscripts  0 \" and  1 \" to describe the unperturbed and perturbed quantities , respectively .",
    "we would stress that , the amplitude of fluctuations is assumed to be small in our linear analysis . in simulations ( e.g. , figures 3 and 4 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , however , the amplitudes can be significantly large",
    ". nevertheless , the linear analysis may reveal the relationship of fluctuations of physical quantities . combining equations ( [ eenergye])-([estate ] ) with @xmath34 , we have @xmath35 where the dimensionless parameter @xmath36 is expressed as @xmath37}}\\left [ { 7 - 6\\beta + { { 2\\beta } \\over { \\gamma   - 1 } } - { { 7\\beta \\left ( { 4 - 3\\gamma } \\right)\\left ( { 1 - \\beta } \\right ) } \\over { \\left ( { \\gamma   - 1 } \\right)\\left ( { 4 - 3\\beta } \\right ) } } } \\right],\\ ] ] and the thermal time - scale @xmath38 takes the from ( with @xmath39 ) : @xmath40{1 \\over { \\alpha { \\omega _ { \\rm{k}}}}}.\\ ] ] we choose @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( e.g. , @xcite ) for numerical calculations .",
    "the variation of @xmath36 with @xmath22 is shown by the solid line in figure  [ graph1 ] .",
    "the other two parameters , @xmath43 ( dashed line ) and @xmath44 ( dotted line ) , will be introduced by equations  ( [ aff ] ) and ( [ arad ] ) , respectively .    by assuming that the time - dependent component of fluctuations takes the form of @xmath45 , e.g. , @xmath46",
    "@xmath47 @xmath48 , we have the following relationship from equation  ( [ etemperaturep ] ) : @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 represent the fluctuations with @xmath52 of the viscous heating and those of the radiative cooling , respectively",
    ". we would stress that equation ( [ erelationship ] ) is a key relationship in the present work .",
    "equation ( [ erelationship ] ) can be modified as @xmath53 where the delay time @xmath54 of the radiative cooling compared with the viscous heating takes the form : @xmath55 obviously , this equation implies @xmath56 for long time - scale fluctuations .",
    "figure  [ graph2 ] shows the variation of @xmath54 for three different values of @xmath22 .",
    "the simulations for @xmath57 ( @xcite ) showed that fluctuations of magnetic energy lead those of radiation energy by @xmath58 orbit periods ( @xmath59 ) , roughly a thermal time .",
    "moreover , figure  5 of @xcite indicates that significant variability occurs in the range @xmath60 , which is equivalent to @xmath61 , corresponding to the region between the two vertical dot - dashed lines in figure  2 .",
    "as shown by the solid line , the delay in our analysis is around @xmath62 , which is consistent with the simulations .",
    "in addition , we would point out that the delay between viscous heating and magnetic energy ( @xmath63 , @xcite ) is negligible compared with the thermal time - scale .",
    "furthermore , simulations have been done for the gas - pressure - dominated case ( @xcite ) and the case that gas and radiation pressures are comparable ( @xcite ) .",
    "the delay in those simulations is @xmath64 for @xmath65 and @xmath66 for @xmath67 . in our analysis , as shown by the dotted and dashed lines , the delay is around @xmath68 for @xmath69 and @xmath70 for @xmath71 in the range @xmath61 , which is again consistent with the simulations .",
    "note that @xmath26 in the simulations for @xmath65 ( @xcite ) is dominated by the free - free absorption .",
    "in such case , for a simple approach , we modify the parameter @xmath36 as @xmath43 by considering the free - free absorption instead of the electron scattering in equation  ( 3 ) : @xmath72 } } \\\\ \\left [ { 7 - 6\\beta + { { 2\\beta } \\over { \\gamma   - 1 } } - { { 7\\beta \\left ( { 4 - 3\\gamma } \\right)\\left ( { 1 - \\beta } \\right ) } \\over { \\left ( { \\gamma   - 1 } \\right)\\left ( { 4 - 3\\beta } \\right ) } } } \\right].\\ ] ] the profile of @xmath43 is shown by the dashed line in figure  1 .      in this subsection , we will show a comparison between our analytic normalized power spectrum of radiation energy @xmath73 and that in simulations @xmath74 .",
    "equation  ( [ ee ] ) provides the relationship of the power spectrum between the radiative cooling @xmath75 and the viscous heating @xmath76 : @xmath77 then the analytic power spectrum of volume - integrated radiation energy @xmath73 is expressed as @xmath78 where the quantity @xmath44 is derived from equations ( [ eenergye ] ) , ( [ evertical ] ) , and ( [ estate ] ) : @xmath79 the variation of @xmath44 with @xmath22 is shown by the dotted line in figure  [ graph1 ] . since the viscous heating is mainly due to the dissipation of magnetic energy , it is plausible to have @xmath80{p_b}(f),\\ ] ] where @xmath81 is the dissipation time - scale of magnetic energy , and @xmath82 is the power spectrum of magnetic energy .",
    "the explanation for this relationship is presented in appendix a. then , equations ( [ eparad ] ) and ( [ pmpvis ] ) provide an analytic relationship between the power spectrum of radiation energy and that of magnetic energy : @xmath83    the simulations ( equation  ( 17 ) and figure  5 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) showed the profiles of @xmath82 and @xmath74 : @xmath84 @xmath85 in our figure  3 , we replot the above @xmath82 and @xmath74 with the dotted and dashed lines , respectively . in addition , according to equation  ( [ epvispb ] ) , we plot the analytic power spectrum @xmath73 with the solid line .",
    "the values of @xmath86 in equation  ( [ epvispb ] ) are taken from the above simulation results ( the dotted line ) .",
    "the parameters for calculating @xmath73 are @xmath87 , @xmath88 ( corresponding to @xmath89 ) , and @xmath90 ( @xcite ) .",
    "as shown by the solid and dashed lines , our analytic @xmath73 agrees well with @xmath74 in simulations .",
    "the energy equation implies a correlation between the viscous heating ( magnetic energy ) and the pressure .",
    "based on equation  ( [ etemperaturep ] ) , the correlation can be read as : @xmath91 owning to the same reason , there should be a correlation between viscous heating and magnetic energy , i.e. , @xmath92 . with equation  ( 16 ) , the above equation can be modified as @xmath93 as shown in figure  1 , there exists @xmath94 for @xmath89 , so we have the relationship : @xmath95 which is close to the correlation found in simulations , e.g. , @xmath96 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the difference in the index may be related to the following two reasons : ( 1 ) the analysis is quite simple , particularly in dealing with the vertical radiative cooling ; ( 2 ) the feedback from pressure to stress makes significant contribution .",
    "it is worthy to note that @xcite also provided an explanation for the correlation with a toy model based on the energy equation . by using the correlation between @xmath38 and @xmath20 ( @xmath97 ) obtained in simulations , they derived the correlation between @xmath98 and @xmath20 ( @xmath99 ) . in our analysis",
    ", we choose @xmath17 to replace their radiative cooling term @xmath100 .",
    "we will show below that our results are quite similar to theirs .",
    "equations ( [ eradiationcooling ] ) and ( [ arad ] ) can provide the relationship : @xmath101 in simulations ( @xcite ) , the thermal time is calculated by @xmath102 with equations ( [ eenergye ] ) , ( [ evertical ] ) , ( [ estate ] ) and ( [ ecorrelationqrad ] ) , the above equation can be reduced to @xmath103 where @xmath104}}.\\ ] ] for radiation - pressure - dominated accretion flows , equation ( [ es ] ) can be simplified as @xmath105 .",
    "thus , equation ( [ e22 ] ) indicates the relationship @xmath106 , which is consistent with the correlation in the toy model @xcite .",
    "moreover , in the case of @xmath89 , equation ( [ es ] ) gives @xmath107 , thus @xmath108 , which is close to the correlation found in simulations , e.g. , @xmath109 in simulation 1112a and @xmath110 in simulation 1126b of @xcite .",
    "in the present work , we have studied the fluctuations of standard thin disks by linear analysis of the time - dependent energy equation together with the vertical hydrostatic equilibrium and the equation of state .",
    "our analytic results show that the delay between magnetic energy and radiation energy is consistent with that in previous simulations .",
    "in addition , the analytic power spectrum of radiation energy agrees well with that in simulations .",
    "moreover , the correlation between magnetic energy and radiation energy can be well understood by the analysis , with an index ( @xmath111 ) being close to that in simulations ( @xmath112 ) .    as indicated by equation  ( [ spectral ] )",
    ", there may exist a break frequency @xmath113 in @xmath75 .",
    "the frequency @xmath114 may be associated with the high - frequency break observed in the power spectra of luminosity fluctuations ( e.g. , @xcite ) , since its value in the inner region of disk is close to that of observed high frequency break .",
    "moreover , the difference between @xmath75 and @xmath76 for @xmath115 , shown by equation ( [ spectral ] ) , should be taken into account in modeling the high - frequency variability of quasar luminosity ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the similar frequency break may also occur in radiatively inefficient accretion flows , such as advection - dominated accretion flows ( @xcite ) and slim disks ( @xcite ) .",
    "we thank the referee , omer blaes , for helpful suggestions and useful communications to improve the paper .",
    "we also thank feng yuan and sheng - ming zheng for beneficial discussions .",

    "in this appendix , we try to derive the relationship between @xmath116 and @xmath117 as shown by equation ( [ pmpvis ] ) .",
    "the evolution of magnetic energy @xmath118 can be simply described as @xmath119 where @xmath120 and @xmath121 are respectively the generation and dissipation rate of magnetic energy . with small amplitude perturbations in equation ( [ emagneticenergyevolution ] ) , we have @xmath122 or @xmath123^{\\ast } } - { \\left [ { { { \\left ( { { { { g_{b,1 } } } \\over { { g_{b,0 } } } } } \\right)}_\\omega } } \\right]^{\\ast } } \\times { \\left ( { { { { d_{b,1 } } } \\over { { d_{b,0 } } } } } \\right)_\\omega } , \\ ] ] where @xmath124 , @xmath125 , the symbol `` @xmath126 '' represents the complex conjugate number , the power spectrum of @xmath127 and @xmath128 are      magnetic fields in the accretion disk present exponential growth owing to the magnetorotational instability ( mri , @xcite ) , followed by the dissipation due to some destructive mechanisms .",
    "since the rise and decay phases of channel modes are similar ( e.g. , figure  4 of @xcite ) , it is plausible to believe that @xmath130 and @xmath131 is comparable for @xmath132 . with the consideration of the delay ( @xmath133 ) between @xmath127 and @xmath128",
