    "momentum resolved inelastic x - ray scattering ( ixs ) is a technique introduced @xcite and widely used @xcite at synchrotron radiation facilities for studies of atomic - scale dynamics in condensed matter .",
    "ixs is a photon - in - photon - out method applicable to any condensed matter system , whether it is solid , liquid , biological , or of any other nature .",
    "a photon with energy @xmath4 and momentum @xmath5 changes its energy and momentum to @xmath6 and @xmath7 in an inelastic scattering process in the sample and leaves behind a collective excitation with energy @xmath8 and momentum @xmath9 , respectively , as shown in the sketch in fig .",
    "[ fig000 ] .",
    "the interpretation of ixs is straightforward as it measures the dynamical structure factor @xmath10 , _",
    "i.e. _ the spatiotemporal fourier transform of the van hove time - dependent pair correlation function @xcite .",
    "therefore , it provides access to dynamics on a length scale @xmath11 and at a time scale @xmath12 .",
    "( 1,0.49)(0,0 ) ( 0.0,0.00 ) ) and energy - momentum ( @xmath13 ) space of excitations relevant in condensed matter .",
    "the figure indicates how different domains are accessed by different inelastic scattering probes : neutrons ( ins ) , x - rays ( ixs ) , ultraviolet ( iuvs ) , and brillouin light scattering ( bls ) .",
    "the ultra - high - resolution ixs ( uhrix ) spectrometer presented in ref .",
    "@xcite entered the previously inaccessible region marked in shaded green .",
    "the novel capabilities discussed in the present paper will enable ixs experiments with 0.1-mev and 0.02-nm@xmath0 resolution in the region marked in shaded light green .",
    "hence , it allows to close the existing gap between the high - frequency and low - frequency probes .",
    "the energy @xmath14 and the momentum @xmath15 transfers from initial to final photon / neutron states are measured in inelastic scattering experiments , as schematically shown in the inset.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]    ixs is one of only a few existing inelastic scattering techniques .",
    "each technique provides access to a limited region in the time - length scale or equivalently in the energy - momentum space of collective excitations relevant for condensed matter .",
    "figure  [ fig000 ] shows how a broad range of excitations are covered by different inelastic scattering probes : neutrons ( ins ) , x - rays ( ixs ) , ultraviolet light ( iuvs ) , and brillouin light scattering ( bls ) .",
    "a gap remains in experimental capabilities between low - frequency ( visible and ultraviolet light ) and high - frequency ( x - rays and neutrons ) inelastic scattering techniques .",
    "hence , dynamics in the range from about 1 - 100 picosecond ( ps ) on atomic- and meso - scales is still inaccessible by any known experimental probe .",
    "this is precisely the region of vital importance for disordered systems and therefore many outstanding problems in condensed matter dynamics , such as the nature of the liquid to glass transition , could be addressed by entering this unexplored domain .    in principle",
    "there are no limitations preventing ixs from penetrating this unexplored dynamic range of excitations .",
    "this would , however , require solving two longstanding challenges in ixs . first , ixs spectrometers in their traditional implementation rely on an x - ray optics concept utilizing single - bounce bragg back - reflecting spherical analyzers , leading to pronounced lorentzian tails of the spectral resolution function .",
    "this approach has reached an impasse where the best numbers in energy ( @xmath16  mev ) and momentum transfer ( @xmath17  nm@xmath0 ) resolutions have not improved for the past 20 years @xcite .",
    "second , the ixs signal is very weak .",
    "for example , with @xmath18 incident photons there is often less than one photon inelastically scattered into the detector .",
    "hence , more efficient ixs spectrometers with better resolution and more powerful x - ray sources are required to advance the field .",
    "recently , a new type of dispersive spectrometer was tested for the first time .",
    "this ultra - high - resolution ixs ( uhrix ) spectrometer @xcite achieved a spectral resolution of 0.6  mev at a momentum transfer down to 0.25  nm@xmath0 ( shaded green area in fig .",
    "[ fig000 ] ) . additionally , the spectral contrast improved by an order of magnitude compared to traditional ixs spectrometers @xcite . to sharpen the desired resolution to 0.1  mev and 0.02-nm@xmath0 and to ensure higher count rates , we propose to further develop the angular dispersive x - ray optical scheme @xcite replacing scanning ixs spectrometers with broadband imaging spectrographs @xcite .",
    "in addition to these optics developments , new types of x - ray sources are on the horizon that will overcome the problem of insufficient ixs cross - section by delivering a higher spectral flux , namely seeded high - repetition rate x - ray free - electron lasers ( xfels ) .",
    "low - gain x - ray free - electron laser oscillators ( xfelos ) may in some time in the future produce a spectral flux of up to @xmath19 photons / s / mev @xcite , but currently they are still under conceptual development @xcite .",
    "high - gain xfels , on the other hand , are available today .",
    "self - amplified spontaneous emission ( sase ) x - ray free - electron lasers ( xfels ) @xcite deliver light pulses with unprecedented peak power compared to storage - ring based sources .",
    "however , the average photon flux that can be delivered is limited due to the low repetition rate of their linac drivers . by contrast",
    ", the european xfel s plan to adopt superconducting accelerator technology will allow for producing @xmath20 x - ray pulses per second , _",
    "i.e. _ orders of magnitude above the @xmath21 pulses per second of the lcls and the @xmath22 pulses per second at sacla .",
    "the uhrix instrument with the desired 0.1  mev resolution can be installed at the sase-2 beamline of the european xfel together with the mid instrument @xcite operating in the 5 - 25 kev range .",
    "uhrix performs best at relatively low photon energies between @xmath23 and @xmath24 kev with an optimum around @xmath25 kev .",
    "owing to the high repetition rate of the european xfel , the nominal average output flux at sase-2 amounts to about @xmath26 photons / s / mev at 9 kev , which is more than one order of magnitude greater than at synchrotron radiation facilities @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the spectral flux can be substantially increased by self - seeding @xcite , which at the european xfel first will be available at the sase-2 beamline @xcite .",
    "another order of magnitude increase in flux is achievable by tapering the magnetic field of the seeded undulator @xcite .",
    "we therefore propose an optimized configuration of the sase-2 x - ray source combining self - seeding and undulator tapering techniques in order to reach more than @xmath27 photons / s / mev , the same number estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite . in combination with the advanced ixs spectrometer described here ,",
    "this may become a real game - changer for ultra - high - resolution x - ray spectroscopy , for ixs in particular , and hence for the studies of dynamics in disordered systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : sase-2 ] we demonstrate that self - seeding , combined with undulator tapering , allows achieving the aforementioned figure of @xmath27 photons per second per mev bandwidth at the optimal photon energy range around 9 kev .",
    "this result is achieved by careful numerical modeling using the xfel code genesis @xcite and start - to - end simulations for the european xfel . in section  [ xrayoptics ]",
    "we introduce and evaluate the x - ray optical design to achieve 0.1  mev resolution ixs .",
    "the choice of optical elements and their design parameters are studied by dynamical theory calculations for monochromatization insection  [ monos ] , and by geometrical optics considerations for x - ray focusing in section  [ ray ] .",
    "the spectrograph design with a spectral resolution of 0.1  mev in a 5.8  mev wide spectral window of imaging is presented in section  [ spectrograph ] .",
    "the design parameters are verified in section  [ wave ] by wavefront propagation simulations from source to sample using a combination of genesis @xcite and srw @xcite codes .",
    "all results are summarized and discussed in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    ".,scaledwidth=50.0% ]        this section describes a configuration of the sase-2 x - ray source at the european xfel , combining hard x - ray self - seeding ( hxrss ) and undulator tapering techniques in order to optimize the average output spectral flux around @xmath25 kev , which is the optimum working point of the uhrix setup . in its simplest configuration ,",
    "a hxrss setup consists of an input undulator and an output undulator separated by a chicane with a single crystal monochromator @xcite . like this , it has been implemented both at lcls @xcite and at sacla @xcite .",
    "the time structure of the european xfel is characterized by @xmath24 macropulses per second , each macropulse consisting of @xmath28 pulses , with @xmath29 mhz repetition rate inside the macropulse .",
    "the energy carried by each pulse and the performance of the crystal cooling system , removing deposited heat between macropulses , should conservatively satisfy the condition that during a macropulse , the drift in the central frequency of the crystal transmission function can not exceed the darwin width .",
    "then , due to the high repetition rate of the european xfel , the simplest two - undulator configuration for hxrss is not optimal and a setup with three undulators separated by two chicanes with monochromators is proposed .",
    "this amplification - monochromatization double cascade scheme is characterized by a small heat load on the crystals and a high spectral purity of the output radiation @xcite .",
    "the figure of merit to optimize for ixs experiments is the average spectral photon flux . here , the high - repetition rate of the european xfel yields a clear advantage compared with other xfels .",
    "however , even relying on its high repetition rate , the maximum output of the european xfel is @xmath30 in sase mode at saturation , which is too low to satisfy the flux requirements discussed in the previous section . therefore self - seeding and undulator tapering",
    "are needed .",
    "the techniques proposed in this article exploit another unique feature of the european xfel , namely its very long undulators .",
    "the sase-2 line will feature @xmath31 segments , each consisting of a @xmath23 m long undulator with @xmath32 mm period .",
    "the 175  m sase-2 , undulator is much longer than required to reach saturation at @xmath25 kev ( at @xmath33 gev electron energy and @xmath34 pc pulse charge the saturation length amounts to about @xmath22 m ) .",

    "[ fig005](v ) and ( h ) . in the image plane",
    "the vertical width of approximately @xmath61 m is much larger but all monochromatic profiles are almost at the same position so they probe the same scattering volume , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig005](d ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the ray - transfer matrix calculations predicting zero linear dispersion in the image plane , as desired .",
    "in contrast , in the focal plane different monochromatic components are focused to much smaller sizes ( @xmath62  @xmath3 m ) but without spatial overlap , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig005](c ) .",
    "figure  [ fig005](v ) illustrates the origin of this behavior : each monochromatic radiation component emanates from the cddw+w monochromator ( located in the first approximation in the object plane ) with a very small angular spread @xmath63rad .",
    "therefore , with a virtual source position practically at infinity they are focused onto the focal plane .",
    "different monochromatic components emanate at different angles because of strong angular dispersion in the cddw+w monochromator that eventually results in a linear dispersion in the vertical direction of the focal plane but no dispersion in the image plane , as required for uhrix .",
    "the horizontal transverse size of the x - ray pulse is independent of photon energy , since angular dispersion in the cddw+w monochromator takes place only in the vertical plane .",
    "the smallest horizontal beam size is achieved near the focal plane with @xmath64 m ( see fig .  [ fig005](a ) and fig .  [ fig005](c ) ) .",
    "this occurs because of the very small horizontal angular spread @xmath65rad of all x - ray spectral components emanating from the cddw+w monochromator .",
    "we note that the best position for the sample is actually neither in the image plane nor in the focal plane . as follows from the dependence presented by the dashed line fig .",

    "[ focusingoptics ] does not introduce any substantial differences with respect to the initial simulations with an idealized , thin crl .",
    "the strong angular dispersion in the cddw+w monochromator also causes substantial pulse dilation , as ray - transfer matrix calculations have shown in section  [ dilation ] .",
    "here we present and discuss results of calculations of the spatiotemporal distributions of the x - ray pulses obtained by the wavefront propagation simulations .",
    "the pulse duration at the exit of the undulator is only 15  fs ( fwhm ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig00999 ] .",
    "the pulse spectral bandwidth is @xmath68  mev and it is reduced to @xmath69  mev ( fwhm ) by the crystal monochromators . assuming a gaussian spectral distribution after the cddw+w monochromator , we obtain for the duration of a fourier - transform - limited pulse @xmath70  ps ( fwhm ) .",
    "the results of the calculations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig004333 ] predict , however , a more than an order of magnitude larger pulse duration of @xmath71  ps .",
    "this number agrees well with the duration calculated in section  [ dilation ] as a result of the wave front inclination caused by angular dispersion in the cddw+w monochromator .",
    "the wavefront propagation simulations confirm the soundness of the optical design of the uhrix instrument worked out initially by the ray - transfer matrix approach and dynamical theory calculations .",
    "they also confirm the feasibility of the target specifications .",
    "the simulations show that the spectral flux from the xfel undulator can be transported to the sample through the uhrix x - ray optics with 30% efficiency reaching a remarkably high value of @xmath72  ph / s / mev .",
    "this number exceeds by more than three orders of magnitude the spectral flux numbers reported for state - of - the - art ixs instruments at synchrotron radiation facilities @xcite .",
    "custom designed crystal and focusing optics ensure that on the sample @xmath73  ph / s / mev photons can be concentrated in a spectral band of @xmath74  mev in a spot of @xmath75m@xmath76 size and with a momentum transfer spread of @xmath77  nm@xmath0 .",
    "this article explores novel opportunities for ultra - high - resolution ixs ( uhrix ) at high repetition rate xfels unlocked by the recent demonstration of a conceptually new spectrometer @xcite with unprecedented specifications ( 0.6 mev spectral resolution and 0.25 nm@xmath0 momentum transfer ) , operating around @xmath25 kev .",
    "its exploitation , together with the broadband ultra - high - resolution imaging spectrograph proposed in @xcite will make it possible to fill the energy - momentum gap between high and low frequency inelastic probes and to provide exciting new opportunities for studies of dynamics in condensed matter . in particular , uhrix experiments can be enabled at the european xfel , where an increase of more than three orders of magnitude in average spectral flux is expected compared to what is available today at synchrotrons . the gain is due to two main factors : firstly , the high repetition rate of the european xfel , owing to the superconducting linac accelerator driver , which allows up to 27000 x - ray pulses per second , and secondly , the presence of long undulators , allowing the combined implementation of hard x - ray self - seeding ( hxrss ) and post - saturation tapering techniques . in particular , a double - chicane hxrss scheme increases the signal - to - noise ratio and eases the heat - load on the hxrss crystals to a tolerable level .",

    "simulations of pulse propagation up to the sample position through the uhrix optics show that an unprecedented average spectral flux of @xmath78  ph / s / mev is feasible .",
