    "for many physical cases in qcd , an observable quantity is usually expressed in terms of truncated series in the coupling constant @xmath0 with given coefficients , so that in the next - to - next - to - next - to - leading order ( n@xmath4lo ) we get @xmath5 where @xmath6 are some numbers , and @xmath7 is a fixed scale .",
    "so , the value @xmath8 is the single - scale quantity .",
    "the exhausted examples are the followings :    1 .   the hadronic fraction of @xmath1-decay width @xcite @xmath9 }    { \\gamma[\\tau\\to \\nu_{\\tau}e^+\\nu_e ] } = \\nonumber\\\\ & & { \\cal r}_{\\tau}^{[0 ] } \\left (     1 + c_1^{\\tau}\\,\\frac{\\alpha_s(m_{\\tau})}{\\pi}+         c_2^{\\tau}\\,\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_s(m_{\\tau})}{\\pi}\\right)^2 +         c_3^{\\tau}\\,\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_s(m_{\\tau})}{\\pi}\\right)^3    + \\delta r_{\\mbox{\\small np}}\\right ) ,    \\label{eq:2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10}=3.058 $ ] , the coefficients are given by @xmath11 and @xmath12 is a nonperturbative contribution .",
    "the hadronic fraction of @xmath2-decay width @xcite @xmath13 }    { \\gamma[\\eta_c\\to \\gamma\\gamma ] } = { \\cal r}_{\\eta_c}^{[0 ] } \\left (     1 + d_1\\,\\frac{\\alpha_s(2 m_c)}{\\pi}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 } = \\frac{c_f}{2n_c}\\,\\frac{1}{e_c^4}\\ , \\frac{\\alpha_s^2(2m_c)}{\\alpha^2_{\\rm em}}\\ ] ] with @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the number of colors , @xmath17 is the electric charge of charmed quark , and the coefficient @xmath18 is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the number of ` active ' flavors , and @xmath21 is the pole mass of charmed quark .",
    "the above formulae can be used for the extraction of @xmath0 at the appropriate scale .",
    "the value of @xmath0-corrections is numerically significant .",
    "so , the problem is how the truncated series can be improved .",
    "the well - established approach to the solution of such the problem is a resummation of some significant terms .",
    "we mention two of such techniques .",
    "the first is the summation of @xmath22 contributions , where @xmath23 is the first coefficient of @xmath24-function in qcd @xcite .",
    "the second procedure is based on an appropriate change of renormalization scheme by @xmath25 to the given order in the coupling constant , which allows one to decrease a role of higher - order corrections or even to minimize it with the modification of @xmath26-function resulting in a different running of @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "the disadvantage of above methods is twofold .",
    "first , the next - order correction while computed exactly can essentially differ from the approximation of @xmath28-dominance .",
    "second , the redefinition of renormalization scheme leads to the scale or normalization - point dependence of matching procedure .    in this paper",
    "we present a procedure to improve the truncated series in the framework of renormalization group by introducing an auxiliary scale and taking a single - scale limit .",
    "a general formalism is given in section [ sec:2 ] .",
    "the numerical estimates are presented in section [ sec:3 ] .",
    "the analysis of scale dependence for the @xmath2-decay rate is performed , since the normalization at the pole mass involves the additional problem caused by the residual change of @xmath21 by the variation of normalization point in the @xmath3-mass @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "our results are summarized in conclusion .",
    "for the sake of clarity , let us start with the consideration of first - order correction .",
    "@xmath30 } = 1+c_1 \\frac{\\alpha_s(\\lambda)}{\\pi}.\\ ] ] introduce an auxiliary scale @xmath31 , so that @xmath32 making use of the renormalization group relation to the first order in @xmath0 , @xmath33 we clearly get @xmath34^{\\displaystyle \\frac{2 c_1}{\\beta_0\\ln\\kappa}},\\ ] ] which gives the ordinary presentation improved by the renormalization group .",
    "note , that one finds the limit @xmath35 which will be correct for the further consideration at a fixed order in @xmath0 .    the single - scale limit of @xmath36 can be easily evaluated @xmath37,\\ ] ] which is our result for the case of first - order correction .    in order to proceed with the higher - order corrections ,",
    "let me perform the derivation in another way .",
    "so , the @xmath24-function has the form @xmath38 with @xmath39 .",
    "to the first order it gives @xmath40,\\ ] ] at @xmath36 .",
    "then , @xmath41^{\\displaystyle \\frac{2 c_1}{\\beta_0\\ln\\kappa}}\\approx   \\exp\\left[c_1 \\frac{\\alpha_s(\\lambda)}{\\pi } \\right],\\ ] ] and expanding in @xmath0 , we rederive the renormalization group improvement ( rgi ) for the first - order correction .    further , we can easily find the rgi for the third order in @xmath0 ( n@xmath4lo ) . indeed , since @xmath42,\\ ] ] we get @xmath43^{\\displaystyle \\frac{c_1 + 4\\bar c_2\\,{\\mathfrak a}+16 \\bar c_3\\,{\\mathfrak a}^2}{\\beta_0+\\beta_1\\,{\\mathfrak a}+ \\beta_2\\,{\\mathfrak a}^2}\\frac{4}{\\ln\\kappa^2 } } =    \\exp\\left[c_1 \\frac{\\alpha_s(\\lambda)}{\\pi}+\\bar c_2   \\left(\\frac{\\alpha_s(\\lambda)}{\\pi}\\right)+\\bar c_3   \\left(\\frac{\\alpha_s(\\lambda)}{\\pi}\\right ) \\right],\\ ] ] where we put @xmath44 expanding in @xmath0 at @xmath36 , we find @xmath45^{\\displaystyle \\frac{c_1 + 4\\bar c_2\\,{\\mathfrak a}+16 \\bar c_3\\,{\\mathfrak a}^2}{\\beta_0+\\beta_1\\,{\\mathfrak a}+ \\beta_2\\,{\\mathfrak a}^2}\\frac{4}{\\ln\\kappa^2}}\\approx 1 + c_1\\,\\frac{\\alpha_s(\\lambda)}{\\pi}+               c_2\\,\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_s(\\lambda)}{\\pi}\\right)^2 +               c_3\\,\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_s(\\lambda)}{\\pi}\\right)^3.\\ ] ] thus , the third - order improved expression has the form @xmath46\\ ] ] we stress the renormalization group motivation used in contrast to _ ad hoc _ method of pad approximants .",
    "let us show how the improvement works in a simple example .",
    "so , we consider a rather oscillating sum , @xmath47 which reveals a ` slow ' convergency , since @xmath48}=1,\\quad   { \\cal e}^{[1]}=0.5,\\quad { \\cal e}^{[1]}=0.8,\\ ] ] while @xmath49\\ ] ] results in @xmath50 } = 1,\\quad { \\cal e}^{\\mbox{\\sc rgi}}_{[1 ] } = 0.61,\\quad { \\cal e}^{\\mbox{\\sc rgi}}_{[2 ] } = 0.72,\\ ] ] which is ` more stable ' .",
    "thus , we expect that @xmath51 possesses a more numerical stability in the truncated series .",
    "of course , if a series is essentially asymptotic , the improvement can not cancel a ` bad ' convergency .",
    "next , we have to mention the numerical problem often appearing with the @xmath0-corrections to the amplitudes and the amplitudes squared if those corrections are significantly large . indeed",
    ", the correction to the amplitude @xmath52}(1+c_1\\alpha_s)\\ ] ] should lead to @xmath53}\\right)^2(1 + 2\\,c_1\\alpha_s),\\ ] ] so that the ratio @xmath54 numerically deviates from unit .",
    "the rgi has no such the problem , since the exponent does not involve the above mismatching .",
    "finally , we stress that the rgi does not present some kind of resummation of higher orders . in the resummation technique",
    "one certainly suggests a form of higher - order terms .",
    "in contrast , we give the exact expression produced by the renormalization group . at small @xmath0",
    "as dictated by the perturbative paradigm , the expression can be expanded till the appropriate order .",
    "thus , one could claim that the rgi procedure looks like overflying the accuracy . to my opinion",
    ", one should use the rgi point as a central value of the calculated quantity , while the expansion truncated to the given order would indicate a systematic error of numerical estimate .",
    "the rgi formula for the @xmath1-lepton decays into hadrons reads off @xmath55 } \\left\\{\\exp\\left [         c_1^{\\tau}\\,\\frac{\\alpha_s(m_{\\tau})}{\\pi}+        \\bar c_2^{\\tau}\\,\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_s(m_{\\tau})}{\\pi}\\right)^2 +        \\bar c_3^{\\tau}\\,\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_s(m_{\\tau})}{\\pi}\\right)^3\\right ]    + \\delta r_{\\mbox{\\small np}}\\right\\ } ,    \\label{eq:17a }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 implementing @xmath57 we find @xmath58 which results in @xmath59 where we include the experimental uncertainty , only . for the sake of comparison , the pdg value extracted by the same measurement of @xmath1 rate reads off @xmath60 which respectively gives @xmath61 .",
    "we point out that the theoretical uncertainty in pdg is slightly overestimated , to our opinion , since the displacement of central value extracted in two ways equals @xmath62 .",
    "thus , the preferable value of coupling constant following from the @xmath1-lepton hadronic width is given by @xmath63 with the central point closer to the ` world average ' .",
    "the problem with the estimate of hadronic width of @xmath2-charmonium is twofold .",
    "first , the scale setting in the @xmath0-correction is beyond the accuracy , since its variation contributes to @xmath65 .",
    "so , we should put the arbitrary scale by @xmath66 } \\left (     1 + d_1\\,\\frac{\\alpha_s(\\mu)}{\\pi}\\right ) .",
    "\\label{eq:4a}\\ ] ] the second point is the prescription for the pole mass of charmed quark . in the perturbative qcd , the pole mass is strictly defined .",
    "the relation between the @xmath3-running mass @xmath29 and the pole mass is known to the @xmath67-order @xcite .",
    "explicitly , to the @xmath65-terms @xcite we put @xmath68 with @xmath69 where @xmath70 , and @xmath71 .",
    "th evalue of pole mass is the renormalization invariant .",
    "however , at reasonable scales @xmath72 , the residual dependence due to the truncation of perturbative series is numerically significant .",
    "the reason of such the dependence is a growth of coefficients in series as caused by the renormalon .",
    "in fact , the pole mass becomes a scale - dependent quantity . to avoid this problem ,",
    "the operative procedure is to fix a short - distance mass @xmath73 free off the renormalon and to perform the calculations with the series expressed in terms of @xmath73 .",
    "we exploit two schemes , which lead to results close enough to each other .",
    "the first scheme is given by the @xmath3-running mass @xmath74 .",
    "taking @xmath75 we calculate the pole mass shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "we have checked that the implication of rgi procedure to the relation between the pole and running masses is consistent with the above result , and the effect of rgi can be absorbed into the decrease of @xmath76-value by about @xmath77 mev , which below the systematic accuracy of matching procedure as discussed below .",
    "( 100,70 ) ( 3,3)=100 ( 90,0)@xmath72 , gev ( 0,67)@xmath21 , gev    the second is the potential scheme described in ref @xcite . in this case , we calculate the scale - dependent matching of perturbative 2-loop scatic potential @xmath78 involving the 3-loop running @xmath0 with the phenomenological qcd - motivated static potential @xmath79 containing both the 2-loop short - distance coulomb - like contribution as well as the long - distance linear confining term preserving the infrared stability . then , the potential and , hence , the @xmath80-masses are free off the renormalon .",
    "the heavy quark masses are fixed by the measured spin - average mass - spectra of heavy quarkonia .",
    "so , @xmath81 the matching of scale - dependent perturbative potential @xmath82 is extracted numerically as described in ref @xcite .",
    "thus , the cancellation of renormalon in the sum of @xmath83 gives @xmath84 up to a constant shift @xmath85 independent of the scale .",
    "the matching with the perturbative pole mass in ( [ pole ] ) gives @xmath86 mev , depending on the variation of coupling constant @xmath87 in the limits of @xmath88 .",
    "the value of @xmath85 indicates the accuracy of matching procedure .",
    "the result is presented in fig.[fig:1 ] , which reveals a good agreement of two schemes used .",
    "( 100,70 ) ( 3,3)=100 ( 90,0)@xmath72 , gev ( 0,67)@xmath89    then , the perturbative formula ( [ eq:4a ] ) with ( [ eq:23 ] ) results in the @xmath89 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , wherefrom we get @xmath90 at @xmath91 gev with @xmath92 the estimate in ( [ eq:24 ] ) is slightly greater than the value @xmath93 given by bodwin and chen @xcite .",
    "we stress the scale - stability of our result .",
    "further , at the same scale we find @xmath94 then , comparing ( [ eq:25 ] ) with ( [ eq:24 ] ) we obtain the final estimate including the theoretical uncertainty due to possible contributions of higher orders and , hence , the induced scale - dependence by the variation of central values as @xmath95 which is in agreement with the experimental value @xmath96 to be compared with @xmath97 obtained in @xcite under the resummation of @xmath22-terms .",
    "we point out that the improvement of the experimental accuracy combined with the calculation of @xmath65-correction would give a good opportunity to extract the mass of charmed quark . in this respect ,",
    "we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite , where the @xmath65-corrections were taken into account in the ratio of widths for the decays of @xmath98 and @xmath99 , so that the analysis suffers from the uncertainties related with the relativistic corrections entering the ratio for the different initial states .",
    "the advantage of @xmath89 is the cancellation of such the initial state corrections .",
    "we have developed a general scheme to improve the estimate of truncated perturbative series in qcd by the tool of renormalization group for the single - scale quantities .",
    "the method allows one to get more realistic central values of the quantities as well as to estimate the theoretical uncertainty of results by comparison of rgi values with the perturbatively expanded ones .",
    "the rgi receipt for the calculation of quantity ( [ eq:1 ] ) , ( [ eq:6 ] ) is given by ( [ eq:16 ] ) and ( [ eq:17 ] ) .",
    "we have applied the approach to the fractions of hadronic widths for the @xmath1-lepton and @xmath2-charmonium , which allows us to get realistic estimates of @xmath100}/{\\gamma[\\eta_c\\to \\gamma\\gamma]}\\ ] ] in a reasonable agreement with the appropriately measured values .",
