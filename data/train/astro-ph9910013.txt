    "whereas some kinds of galaxy encounters ( merger of two gas - rich galaxies ) are believed to lead to substantial gas infall and powerful nuclear starbursts , others seem to have much more subtle consequences for the gas behavior and star - formation properties of the colliders .",
    "most studies to date have focussed on the extreme cases rather than on the interactions themselves , and it is still unclear what the fate of the gas is in galaxies involved in various types and stages of an interaction . in this paper , we study the properties of a complete , optically selected sample of interacting galaxies in which we have searched for both the @xmath3co(10 ) and the hi lines and estimated the total amounts of molecular and atomic gas ( horellou & booth @xcite ) . the sample is not biased towards far - infrared ( hereafter fir)-luminous galaxies .",
    "it contains all interacting galaxies in a well - defined region of the southern sky with a blue magnitude brighter than 14.5 @xmath4 0.3 ( bergvall @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath5 photometry , optical spectra and images have been published ( johansson & bergvall @xcite , bergvall & johansson @xcite ) .",

    "those are not real surface densities since the atomic gas usually extends beyond the optical disk of a galaxy , whereas the molecular gas as traced by the co is confined to the inner part of the disk . nevertheless ,",
    "although being hybrid quantities , they provide information on _ global _ galaxy properties and can be compared to the values determined for other samples .",
    "table 1 describes the completeness of the dataset . in order to take into account the non - detections",
    ", we have applied a survival analysis ( see isobe et al .",
    "we have used the kaplan - meyer estimator to calculate the average of a dataset containing censored data ( upper limits ) .",
    "the mean values of the gas masses in atomic and molecular form are given in table 2 .",
    "we list the results obtained for the detected galaxies and those estimated for the whole sample .",
    "@xmath15 interacting galaxies have less per unit area    we have compared the hi surface density of the interacting galaxies with those of isolated galaxies observed by haynes & giovannelli ( @xcite , hereafter hg84 ) , who have derived a canonical value of 6.81@xmath40.24 for @xmath9 when averaging over all morphological types . _",
    "the interacting galaxies clearly have a lower hi surface density : _",
    "6.33@xmath40.51 for the -detected ones , and 6.18 for the whole sample ( here we have taken ugc diameters for comparison with hg84 and not @xmath7 as in table ii . )",
    "the same effect is found when normalizing to the blue luminosity rather than to the optical area .",
    "@xmath15 an elevated star formation efficiency    using observations of isolated galaxies and of galaxies in the outer parts of clusters , casoli et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have established a linear relationship between @xmath10 and @xmath16 .",
    "their fit is in very good agreement with the one that we obtain for the co - detected interacting galaxies ( solid line in the @xmath10-@xmath16 plot displayed on figure 1a ) . however , if we include the non - detections in a survival analysis , our fit falls well below the one for isolated galaxies .",
    "this means that for the same fir luminosity , interacting galaxies have less molecular gas .",
    "if one interprets the @xmath17/m(h@xmath1 ) ratio as an indicator of the star - formation efficiency ( sfe ) , then _ interacting galaxies have a higher sfe compared to isolated galaxies_.      as pointed out by other authors ( e.g. , mirabel & sanders @xcite ) , we find that the fraction of molecular gas in interacting galaxies increases with the fir luminosity ( figure 1b ) . we have searched for relations between the gas content or tracers of the star formation activity ( optical colors , fir luminosity and dust temperature ) and the apparent degree of morphological distortion , using bergvall s ( 1981 ) classification ( 0 : undisturbed ; 1 : weak ; 2 : medium ; 3 : strong ) .",
    "the most strongly disturbed galaxies do not have significantly different optical colors .",
    "their dust temperatures are slightly higher than than those of the less disturbed ones but the difference is at a few @xmath18 level .",
    "although all the sample galaxies are in the state of an interaction or even of a merger , their molecular gas fraction and their star - formation activity are not significantly enhanced .",
    "this can be understood in the light of recent simulations , which clearly show that the evolution of an interacting system is affected by several factors , such as : the initial conditions ( relative mass and morphological types of the colliders ) , the geometry of the encounter ( planar or inclined , prograde or not ; e.g. , howard et al .",
    "@xcite ) and the time scale .",
    "the amount of molecular gas in particular depends critically on the time , since a starburst of @xmath19 100 m@xmath11/yr will exhaust its supply in a few 10@xmath20 yrs .",
    "a high concentration of molecular gas will be observable only during that short period .",
    "selecting galaxies on the basis of their emission - line or far - infrared properties introduces a bias toward a particular kind of interaction and/or stage of merger and excludes the more  quiet \" collisions .",
