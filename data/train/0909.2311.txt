    "the investigation of the macroscopic magnetic properties of type - ii superconductors in the mixed state is already a classical subject . the essential physics behind the collected vast phenomenology has been well known for decades,@xcite and may be basically analyzed in terms of interactions between the flux lines themselves ( lattice elasticity , line cutting ) , and interactions with the underlying crystal structure ( flux pinning ) .    for many purposes",
    ", it happens that the mesoscopic description may be further simplified by means of appropriate material laws for the coarse - grained fields , i.e. : magnetic induction @xmath0 , electric current density @xmath1 and electric field @xmath2 .",
    "averages are supposed to be taken over a volume containing a big enough number of vortices . along this",
    "lines , a brilliant proposal , the so - called critical state ( cs ) theory , originally introduced by c. p. bean@xcite has been widespread used .",
    "such a model allows to capture the main features of the magnetic response of superconductors with pinning at low frequencies and temperatures , through the minimal mathematical complication . in its simplest form ,",
    "the cs theory involves to solve ampre s law @xmath3 with some prescription for the current density ( @xmath4 or @xmath5 ) , and under continuity boundary conditions that incorporate the influence of the sources .",
    "being a quasi - stationary approach , the cs is customarily stated without an explicit role for the transient electric field and the remaining maxwell equations . nevertheless , the recognized prediction power of the theory is not accidental .",
    "although veiled , the role of @xmath6 and faraday s law is of great importance for its soundness .",
    "thus , we recall the above statement may be related to an almost vertical @xmath7 law , idealized by the graph @xmath8 for @xmath9 and @xmath10 for @xmath11 . here , @xmath6 stands for the induced electric field owing to variations of the flux density , and faraday s equation ( in fact lenz s law ) is implicitly used by selecting the actual value @xmath12 or @xmath5 that minimizes flux variations , when solving @xmath3 along the process .    in the case of ideally one - dimensional problems ,",
    "i.e. : infinite cylinders and slabs in parallel field configuration , the previous statements lead to the prediction of the observable physics without ambiguity .",
    "as recalled , one is making a correct use of the maxwell equations for a conducting system that experiments a sharp transition in terms of the current density .",
    "physically , the material law relates to the vortex pinning phenomenon , that is macroscopically described by the average pinning force constraint @xmath13 .",
    "straightforwardly , this gives place to the depinning threshold limitation @xmath14 .",
    "in addition , one has to consider a high flux flow dissipation when the limitation is exceeded ( as related to the mathematical condition @xmath10 ) .",
    "we call the readers attention that for the simplified geometries , the equality @xmath15 ( @xmath16 is locally perpendicular to @xmath17 ) is automatically fulfilled .",
    "the extension of the above ideas to non - idealized systems is not a closed subject yet , it is of utter importance for the understanding of the experimental facts , and constitutes the main motivation of this article . in brief , and following the spirit of bean s model , we consider the question of identifying a theory that allows a general description of the low frequency electrodynamics of hard superconductors with the least conceptual and mathematical load .    from the physical point of view , the allowance of non - parallel flux lines leads to consider a new threshold for the current density , now related to the disorientation of adjacent vortices .",
    "this was already remarked by j. r. clem and a. prez - gonzlez@xcite who analyzed the relation @xmath18 with @xmath19 the angle characterizing the flux lines orientation at a given depth within a superconducting slab .",
    "thus , stemming from the fact that a maximum angle gradient is allowed between vortices so as to avoid cutting and recombination , one has to consider @xmath20.@xcite remarkably , the above mentioned authors showed that both the flux depinning and cutting effects may be treated in a generalized cs framework .",
    "the upgraded theory ( _ double critical state model _ or dcsm ) has been applied with high success since the early 80 s for the understanding of many experiments in which both @xmath21 and @xmath22 are involved .",
    "in addition to the mentioned static threshold conditions , the dcsm generalizes the one - dimensional @xmath7 graph for quasi - stationary processes in terms of the natural concepts @xmath23 and @xmath24 .    from the mathematical point of view",
    ", the dcsm has been mainly applied to experiments with rotating magnetic field components , still parallel to the surface of large samples , i.e. : two - component fields are allowed , but only one independent variable is considered",
    ". however , some aspects that have appeared linked to the investigation of new materials ( small crystallites and high - t@xmath25 films ) , as well as the refinement of previous studies require more specialized statements , so as to include finite size effects , sample inhomogeneity , anisotropy , etc . along this line , some recent advances have to be quoted . on the one side , it has been shown that finite size effects for thin samples may be treated by composition of quasi one - dimensional statements.@xcite in principle",
    ", this idea would allow to include both the @xmath26 and @xmath27 limitations but , to the moment , it has been exploited in the limit @xmath28 . on the other hand , truly two - dimensional configurations in which some symmetry property allows to assume @xmath29 have also been solved by numerical methods.@xcite more recently , as a remarkable advance to be mentioned , the mathematical structure of the dcsm solution in the three dimensional case has been described and obtained variationally for some examples.@xcite    in this work , new perspectives on the application of variational methods@xcite will be presented .",
    "contrary to some recent claim about their restricted scope,@xcite they will be shown to be equivalent to the more conventional differential equation statements for solving cs problems . moreover , in many instances , our solution will be used to extend previous results toward unexplored physical scenarios . in particular ,",
    "the influence of the parameter ratio @xmath30 will be quantified in three dimensional systems . also , allowed by the capability of the theory",
    ", we introduce a new critical angle gradient threshold , that generalizes the two dimensional concept @xmath31 .",
    "on the other hand , the so - called longitudinal transport problem , i.e. : a situation in which a magnetic field is applied along the direction of the transport current will be studied in a 3d configuration . as a central physical result of our paper",
    ", it is shown that the variational method naturally distinguishes between the inductive and potential parts of the background electric field in the cs problems .",
    "it will be shown that the incorporation of the physical idea of the direction of the electric field is straightforward by combining gauss law and the variational statement .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ secgcs ] , the physical background of the general cs concept is introduced . the underlying approximations ( [ mqs ] ) , the validity of the associated material law ( [ matlaw ] ) , and the justification of a variational statement ( [ varprin ] ) are described in detail . in sec .",
    "[ application ] we give a number of explicit examples related to the application of the general cs theory to three dimensional systems .",
    "specifically , we consider various magnetic processes for an infinite slab with a penetrating magnetic field of the form @xmath32 , and described by different models hosted in our theory . it will be shown that our results fully coincide with alternative formulations , when comparison is allowed .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] is devoted to discuss the main results of this work .",
    "this section is devoted to introduce the theoretical background that justifies the critical state concept as a valid constitutive law for superconducting materials .",
    "first , recalling that the cs must be considered an approximation within the magnetoquasistationary ( mqs ) regime of the time - dependent maxwell equations , we will discuss on the related limits for the whole set of electromagnetic physical quantities .",
    "then , we will present a thorough discussion about the representation of the cs as a @xmath33 law for a perfect conductor with restricted currents , in the mqs regime .",
    "finally , the variational statement of the cs is stated .",
    "we will show that the variational principle introduced in previous work @xcite is fully equivalent to the more usual formulation in terms of differential equation statements , in time - discretized form . along this line",
    ", some recent claims about the limited scope of variational formulations@xcite have to be reconsidered .",
    "let us first concentrate on the physical implications related to the mqs approximation within the critical state theory .",
    "recall that , in general , the dynamical behavior of the macroscopic electromagnetic fields is determined by the maxwell equations accompanied by material constitutive laws , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 .",
    "thus , faraday s and ampre s laws represent a coupled system of time evolution field equations @xmath37 taking divergence in both sides of each , and recalling integrability ( permutation of space and time derivatives ) leads to the additional conditions @xmath38 within this picture of the electromagnetic problem , the remainig maxwell equations can be interpreted as `` ( spatial ) initial conditions '' for eq.([eq : maxwell2 ] ) , that define the existence of conserved electric charges , i.e. : @xmath39    eqs .",
    "( [ eq : maxwell1 ] ) , upon substitution of @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 through the constitutive laws , and with appropriate initial conditions , uniquely determine the evolution profiles @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "( color online ) schematics of the time dependence of the electromagnetic fields within the mqs approximation .",
    "a ramp in the magnetic field is induced by the external excitation , within the interval @xmath45 $ ] . as a consequence of a very fast diffusion ( elevated flux flow resistivity )",
    ", the electric field quickly adjusts to a constant value along the interval .",
    "when the magnetic field ramp stops , @xmath6 goes back to zero again .",
    "the _ re - adjusting _ vertical bands are considered a second order effect and allow for charge separation and recombination , according to the specific @xmath46 model.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=30.0% ]    in this paper , as it is customary in hard superconductivity , we will consider @xmath47 as a valid approximation related to neglecting the equilibrium magnetization of the flux line lattice . on the other side , for _ slow _ and",
    "_ uniform _ sweep rates of the magnetic sources , the transient variables @xmath48 , @xmath41 and @xmath49 are small , and proportional to @xmath50 , whereas @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are negligible .",
    "thus , the main hypothesis within the mqs regime is that the _ displacement _ current densities @xmath54 are much smaller than @xmath42 in the bulk , and vanish in a first order treatment ( see fig . [ fig_1 ] ) . this causes a crucial change in the mathematical structure of the maxwell equations : ampere s law is no longer a time evolution equation , but becomes a purely spatial condition .",
    "it reads @xmath55 with approximate integrability condition @xmath56 . in the mqs limit",
    ", faraday s law is the unique time evolution equation .",
    "then , making use of the conductivity law through its inverse function @xmath46 , one can find the evolution profile @xmath57 from @xmath58 we want to mention that the @xmath59formulation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mqs ] ) is definitely the most extended one .",
    "however , the possibilities of @xmath60formulations@xcite and @xmath61formulations@xcite in which the dependent variables are the fields @xmath62 and @xmath16 have also been exploited by several authors .",
    "also , a vector potential oriented theory ( @xmath63formulation ) has been issued recently@xcite , that is a promising path for the investigation of 3d problems .",
    "let s point out two relevant consequences of the mqs limit .    1 .   the constitutive law @xmath35 , which is not used in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mqs ] ) , plays no role in the evolution of the magnetic variables @xmath64 and @xmath42 ; the magnetic `` sector '' is uncoupled from the charge density profile because the coupling term ( charge recombination ) has disappeared .",
    "only the inductive component of @xmath48 ( given by @xmath65 , @xmath66 ) determines the evolution of @xmath64 ( faraday s law ) .",
    "the conducting law in its inverse formulation @xmath67 presents some ambiguity , as far as two different material laws related by @xmath68 determine the same magnetic and current density profiles .    going into some more detail , whereas for the complete maxwell equations statement , the potential component of the electric field ( @xmath69 , @xmath70 ) , is coupled to @xmath64 and @xmath71 through the @xmath72 term , within the mqs limit it is irrelevant for the magnetic quantities . in fact , one can include the presence of charge densities without contradiction with the condition @xmath73 by means of inhomogeneity or non - linearity in the @xmath46 relation .",
    "then one has @xmath74 .",
    "the charge density @xmath49 can be understood as a parameterized charge of _ static _ character , as far as @xmath53 is neglected . as indicated above , once integrated the magnetic variables , and computed @xmath75 , one has the freedom to modify the electrostatic sector if necessary , by the rule @xmath76 , while still maintaining the values of @xmath64 and @xmath42 .",
    "this invariance can be of practical interest , as far as the `` electrostatic '' behavior in the cs is still under discussion , because of the inherent difficulties in the direct measurement of transient charge densities .",
    "recent advances have to be quoted @xcite , but they are still based on the analysis of @xmath71 and some ansatz on the direction of the electric field . to be specific ,",
    "@xmath77 is assumed in that work .",
    "now , we will be more explicit about the material law @xmath36 that dictates the magnetic response of a superconducting sample in the critical state and for a given external excitation .",
    "for simplicity , we start with an overview of the material law for 1d systems ( infinite slabs or cylinders with the external field applied along symmetry axis ) .",
    "the physical concepts will be eventually generalized to 3d .",
    "( color online ) schematic representation of the cs @xmath78 model .",
    "the electric field arises when some _ critical _ condition for the volume current density is reached ( @xmath79 in this 1d representation ) .",
    "corresponding to the mqs approximation in fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] , the electric field instantaneously increases to a certain value , determined by the rate of variation of the magnetic field , and then goes back to zero.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=30.0% ]    for our purposes , it is sufficient to recall that the basic structure of the cs relates to an experimental graph within the @xmath80 plane that basically contains two regions :    1 .",

    "further steps , with @xmath87 increasing above the critical value @xmath88 , i.e. , the eventual transition to the normal state , may be neglected for slow sweep rates of the external sources , which produce moderate electric fields .    within the local description level ,",
    "different models have been used for the corresponding @xmath89 graph , the most popular being    1 .",
    "the _ power law _ model : @xmath90 , with @xmath19 a constant and @xmath91 high . 2 .",
    "the _ piecewise continuous linear _ approximation : @xmath92 for @xmath93 , and @xmath94 for @xmath95 , @xmath96 having a high value .",
    "+ this model and the previous one present a small dependence on the sweep rate , as far as different values of @xmath6 give way to a slightly different @xmath97 .",
    "bean s model _ : constant @xmath97 for @xmath92 , and @xmath98 for @xmath99 ( see fig . [ fig_2 ] ) .",
    "+ this is the simplest model , without sweep rate dependence because only the sign of @xmath6 enters the theory .",
    "bean s model captures the main features of the cs and has been widely used with very good performance since its proposal in the early sixties.@xcite on the other hand , we notice that it may be obtained from the other representations : it corresponds to the limiting cases @xmath100 and @xmath101 respectively , as the reader can easily check .",
    "considering the above ideas as the essential hypotheses of the cs theory , the 3d critical state model will be formulated upon its generalization .",
    "the well known experimental evidence of a practical sweep rate independence for magnetic moment measurements ( unless for high frequency ac sources or at elevated temperatures ) reinforces this simple model as a valid tool in the cs .    in some treatments , the first or second models are implemented , in order to transfer a full @xmath46 law to the maxwell equations . on the other hand , being rate independent , bean s model is no longer a time ",
    "dependent problem , but a path ",
    "dependent one , i.e. : the trajectory of the external sources @xmath102 uniquely determines the magnetic evolution of the sample.@xcite this makes an important difference when one compares to more standard treatments , as far as faraday s law is not completely determined from the path .",

    "the absence of an intrinsic time constant gives way to the arbitrariness in the time scale of the problem . on the other hand ,",
    "the magnitude @xmath105 is not relevant for the @xmath64 and @xmath42 profiles .",
    "in fact , in the applications of beans s model , faraday s law is not strictly solved .",
    "it is just the sign rule ( the _ vectorial _ part of the material law ) , that is used to integrate ampere s law .",
    "notice that such sign rule corresponds to a maximal shielding response against magnetic vector variations , and thus , determines the selection of @xmath106 .",
    "notice that , by symmetry , in the 1d problems one has @xmath107 and both quantities are orthogonal to @xmath64 .",
    "thus , at a basic level , the 1d cs concept is grounded on the existence of pinning forces that act as a barrier against flux flow .",
    "the physical threshold related to a maximum value of the force balancing the magnetostatic term @xmath108 gives place to the concept of maximum ( critical ) current density , and thus to the law @xmath109 here , @xmath110 stands for the component of @xmath62 along the direction @xmath111 .",
    "let us now see how the above ideas may be translated to a 3d scenario from the fundamental point of view .",
    "the main issue is that , in general , the parallelism of @xmath62 and @xmath16 and their perpendicularity to @xmath112 are no longer warranted .",
    "then , a _ sign rule _ does not suffice for determining the solution .",
    "vectorial rule _ is needed and attention must be paid to its mathematical consistency , as well as to the physical significance . in previous work,@xcite",
    "we introduced a geometrical concept that may be of much help when discussing the idea of a general critical state theory .",
    "there must be a region @xmath113 within the @xmath16-space ( possibly oriented according to the local magnetic field @xmath114 , and/or also depending on @xmath115 and @xmath116 ) such that non - dissipative current flow occurs when the condition @xmath117 is verified ( see figs .",
    "[ fig_3 ] , [ fig_4 ] ) .",
    "this concept , together with a very high dissipation when @xmath16 is driven outside @xmath113 by some non vanishing electric field , suffice to determine the relation between the directions of @xmath16 and @xmath62 .",
    "this may be done according to the following argument .    * in the _ critical state _ , the forces arising to avoid the flux flow ( or whatever ) dissipation mechanism act against the exit of @xmath42 from a region @xmath113 with a very high slope .",
    "however , the evolution within @xmath113 is that of a perfect conductor . in the limit of an infinite barrier ,",
    "the reaction is * perpendicular * to the boundary of @xmath113 ( denoted by @xmath118 ) .",
    "thus , starting from an initial configuration with @xmath119 , and under the action of a transient electric field , the vector @xmath42 quickly touches and/or shifts along the boundary , until a point is reached where the condition @xmath120 is fulfilled . owing to the perfect conductivity condition @xmath121 no further evolution can occur ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_3 ] and ref . ) .",
    "faraday s law will be eventually the key for determining the actual point .",
    "recall that the above rule can be expressed as the condition of maximal @xmath122 projection for @xmath123 .",
    "recall also that the fundamental property already discussed for 1d systems is verified : still the modulus @xmath105 is irrelevant .",
    "on the other hand , notice that the _ sign rule _ is nothing but the 1d particular case of the general _ maximum projection rule_. the mathematical consistency is therefore satisfied .",
    "let us now discuss on the physical soundness of the theory .",

    "such a behavior ( compression of transport by penetrating shielding currents ) is straightforwardly deduced from the slopes of the magnetic field profiles in fig .",

    "<S> the magnetic flux dynamics of type - ii superconductors within the critical state regime is posed in a generalized framework , by using a variational theory supported by well established physical principles . </S>",
    "<S> the equivalence between the variational statement and more conventional treatments , based on the solution of the differential maxwell equations together with appropriate conductivity laws is shown . </S>",
    "<S> advantages of the variational method are emphasized , focusing on its numerical performance , that allows to explore new physical scenarios . in particular , we present the extension of the so - called double critical state model to three dimensional configurations in which only flux transport ( t - states ) , cutting ( c - states ) or both mechanisms ( ct - states ) occur . the theory is applied to several problems . </S>",
    "<S> first , we show the features of the transition from t to ct states . </S>",
    "<S> second , we give a generalized expression for the flux cutting threshold in 3d and show its relevance in the slab geometry . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , several models that allow to treat flux depinning and cutting mechanisms are compared . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the longitudinal transport problem ( current is applied parallel to the external magnetic field ) is analyzed both under t and ct conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the complex interaction between shielding and transport is solved . </S>"
