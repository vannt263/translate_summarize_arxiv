    "even after more than a decade of very intense research efforts,@xcite the unique electronic and mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) continue to attract considerable interest .",
    "a major driving force for this interest comes from the prominent role played by phonons in cnts .",
    "phonons are crucial when interpreting experimental data for resonant raman or photoluminescence excitation spectra,@xcite and for the understanding of electrical@xcite and thermal@xcite transport in cnts .",
    "moreover , phonons are responsible for interesting nanoelectromechanical effects in suspended cnts,@xcite and they lead to quantum size effects in the specific heat.@xcite the real - time nonlinear dynamics of a cnt phonon mode has also been monitored experimentally by femtosecond pump - probe techniques ( coherent phonon spectroscopy).@xcite    recent experiments have shown that mechanical oscillations of suspended carbon nanotubes can be excited by a cantilever and detected by scanning force microscopy.@xcite such experiments yield both the frequency @xmath0 and the quality factor @xmath1 ( with decay rate @xmath2 ) of the respective phonon mode .",
    "the so far observed@xcite values , @xmath3 , imply significant decay rates even at rather low temperatures , and require to identify the relevant decay channels for phonons in individual cnts .",
    "our paper is primarily devoted to understanding the importance of phonon - phonon interactions in such decay processes .",
    "the quality factor can also be extracted from raman spectroscopy@xcite and from nanoelectromechanical measurements , using phonon - assisted coulomb blockade spectroscopy@xcite or capacitive detection of mechanical oscillations.@xcite in principle , coherent phonon spectroscopy also allows to access damping rates of phonon modes , and hence their quality factors .",
    "very recently , the possibility of cooling a vibrating carbon nanotube to its phononic ground state has also been discussed.@xcite    the recent experimental progress described above highlights the need for a reliable theory of phonon - phonon ( ph - ph ) interactions in cnts . on the theoretical side , many authors have analyzed the noninteracting problem , i.e. the harmonic ( or linear ) theory , which allows to derive explicit theoretical results for the thermal conductance@xcite and for the specific heat.@xcite motivated by the observation that molecular dynamics calculations seem to be in good agreement with thin - shell model predictions,@xcite several theoretical works@xcite have adapted thin - shell hollow cylinder models@xcite to the calculation of phonon spectra",
    ". however , the thin - shell approach leaves open the question of how to actually choose the width of the carbon sheet .",
    "a popular and more microscopic approach is to instead start from force - constant models,@xcite taking into account up to fourth - nearest - neighbor couplings in the most advanced formulations.@xcite these calculations predict four acoustic phonon branches ( with @xmath4 ) , namely a longitudinal stretch mode , a twist mode , and two degenerate flexural modes ( see sec .  [ seciic ] for details ) .",
    "the resulting phonon spectra are in very good agreement with a much simpler calculation based on continuum elasticity theory,@xcite building on the known elastic isotropy of the honeycomb lattice.@xcite the elastic approach will be employed in our study as well .",
    "provides a general discussion of the accuracy of elastic continuum theories for phonons in cnts .",
    "for very small cnt radius @xmath5 , however , hybridization effects involving carbon @xmath6 orbitals lead to qualitative changes , elastic continuum theories ( at least in the form below ) may break down , and first - principle calculations become necessary.@xcite    in contrast , the problem of ph - ph interactions in cnts is much more difficult and has been treated in only a few works , although phonon anharmonicities are important for several physical observables,@xcite e.g. for thermal expansion ( which is a controversial issue in cnt theory@xcite ) , to explain the stability of low - dimensional materials ( which would be unstable in harmonic approximation due to the mermin - wagner theorem ) , in order to establish a finite thermal conductivity , or to provide a finite lifetime for phonons .",
    "the latter issue is particularly relevant in our context , but aside from a numerical high - temperature study@xcite which ignored the ( lowest - lying ) flexural phonons , to the best of our knowledge ph - ph interactions in cnts have only been studied by mingo and broido.@xcite their work considered three - phonon processes and their effects within a boltzmann transport equation .",
    "the main conclusion of refs .",
    ", was that anharmonic effects are generally weak but important in establishing upper bounds for the thermal conductance .",
    "in addition , they computed the lengthscale up to which phonons show ballistic motion . where applicable , our results below are in accordance with theirs , but four - phonon processes ( which govern the decay of flexural phonons ) have not been studied so far .",
    "we shall consider two important mechanisms for the decay of long - wavelength acoustic phonons in single - wall cnts , namely electron - phonon ( e - ph ) and ph - ph scattering .",
    "we show that the dominant e - ph coupling terms ( resulting from the deformation potential contribution ) do not allow for phonon decay due to kinematic restrictions , and thus an intrinsic upper bound for the temperature - dependent quality factor of the various modes can be derived from ph - ph interactions alone .",
    "these upper bounds are given below .",
    "the problem of phonon decay has in fact a rather long history .",
    "early work on the decay of an optical phonon into two acoustic phonons via anharmonicities@xcite proposed a scheme for nonlinear phonon generation .",
    "phonon decay via ph - ph interaction is also important for the understanding of neutron scattering data@xcite and for the collective excitations in liquid helium.@xcite such effects have even been considered in a proposal for a phonon - based detector of dark matter.@xcite general kinematic restrictions often prevent the decay of phonon modes .",
    "have shown@xcite that a given acoustic phonon can not decay into other modes with higher velocity at any order in the anharmonicity . for the lowest - lying acoustic phonon mode ,",
    "one then expects _ anomalously long lifetimes _ , while the higher acoustic modes typically decay  in three - dimensional ( 3d ) isotropic media with rate @xmath7 for phonon momentum @xmath8.@xcite such questions are particularly interesting in the cnt context , where a degenerate pair of flexural modes has the lowest energy , and the low dimensionality and the quadratic dispersion relation of the flexural mode may give rise to unconventional behavior .    before describing the organization of the paper , we pause for some guidance for focused readers .",
    "experimentally minded readers can find our central predictions for the decay rate ( and hence the quality factor ) of the low - energy phonon modes in eqs .",
    "( [ gamml ] ) , ( [ gammt ] ) and ( [ finalrate ] ) .",
    "the dependence of the resulting @xmath9 factors on the cnt radius @xmath5 is shown in fig .",
    "those interested in the main new theoretical results will find them in eqs .",
    "( [ 3phonon ] ) and ( [ 4phonon ] ) , where the complete low - energy hamiltonian for interacting acoustic phonons in single - wall cnts is given , with the modified flexural dispersion relation ( [ flexnew ] ) .",
    "this modification takes into account the instability of a harmonic theory implied by the mermin - wagner theorem , and includes interaction effects in a nonperturbative manner .",
    "the calculation of the decay rates is then possible in a perturbative manner , and leads to the results quoted above .",
    "let us conclude this introduction with the organization of the paper . in this work , based on the elastic continuum description ,",
    "we formulate a complete and analytical theory of interacting long - wavelength acoustic phonons in single - wall cnts . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we show that the simplicity of the elastic approach allows us to go beyond the harmonic approximation ( which is briefly reviewed in sec .",

    "the theory is then applied in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] to the calculation of phonon decay rates .",
    "we thereby infer intrinsic upper bounds for the quality factor of the relevant acoustic modes .",

    "calculational details have been relegated to two appendices .",
    "finally , we note that while some of our results are also relevant to 2d graphene monolayers,@xcite for the sake of clarity , we restrict ourselves to the cnt case throughout the paper .",

    "in this section we shall develop the low - energy theory of interacting long - wavelength acoustic phonons in cnts . to be specific ,",
    "we first discuss _ semiconducting single - wall cnts _ , where e - ph scattering processes can safely be ignored .",

    "<S> we formulate and study the effective low - energy quantum theory of interacting long - wavelength acoustic phonons in carbon nanotubes within the framework of continuum elasticity theory . </S>",
    "<S> a general and analytical derivation of all three- and four - phonon processes is provided , and the relevant coupling constants are determined in terms of few elastic coefficients . due to the low dimensionality and the parabolic dispersion , the finite - temperature density of noninteracting flexural phonons diverges , and a nonperturbative approach to their interactions is necessary . within a mean - field description , we find that a dynamical gap opens . in practice , this gap is thermally smeared , but still has important consequences . </S>",
    "<S> using our theory , we compute the decay rates of acoustic phonons due to phonon - phonon and electron - phonon interactions , implying upper bounds for their quality factor . </S>"
