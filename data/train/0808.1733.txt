    "the discovery of superconductivity,@xcite now up to 55 k in the lafeaso class of compounds , followed by t@xmath6 of nearly 30 k in the bafe@xmath5as@xmath5 class with the same active conducting fe@xmath5as@xmath5 layer has caused tremendous excitement .",
    "a competition between superconductivity and magnetism is very evident , and the assortment of phenomena , concepts , and proposed models is leading to a wide variety of suggestions that is reminiscent of the heyday of high temperature superconducting cuprates .",
    "there is a serious need to identify and address relatively straightforward questions , in addition to broader investigations to compare and contrast all the @xmath7feaso materials ( @xmath7=rare earth ) to identify trends that might provide a clue .",
    "the system , fese , has the same band filling as the superconducting oxypnictides , but having only two atoms , is structurally simpler and provides more direct questions .",
    "although many samples are two phase and are not always fully characterized , this system is reported to be non - magnetic and non - superconducting at stoichiometry , and is magnetic and clearly superconducting @xcite at se substoichiometry fese@xmath0 .",
    "fese can be substoichiometric on either sublattice and contains two major phases ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) .",
    "the pbo - type @xmath8-fese@xmath0 compound is the one of current interest and has been studied extensively for its spintronics - related magnetic properties by shen and coworkers,@xcite who concluded from observed hysteresis a ferromagnetic ( fm ) state in the nonstoichiometric phase , but a nonmagnetic state in the stoichiometric phase . very recently , hsu _",
    "et al . _ reported superconductivity with @xmath10 k , at @xmath11 and 0.18.@xcite subsequently , @xmath2 has been raised rapidly up to 27 k at pressure @xmath12 gpa,@xcite clearly putting fese@xmath0 in the high t@xmath6 category with iron pnictides having similar band filling .",
    "confirmed @xmath13 k at @xmath14 at ambient pressure.@xcite fang _",
    "investigated isovalent fe(se@xmath15te@xmath16)@xmath17,@xcite finding @xmath18-dependent t@xmath6 in the range of 814 k with maximum at @xmath19 , dipping to zero at @xmath20 .",
    "notably , temperature dependent susceptibility measurements show an anomaly around 100 k , indicating a peculiar and not yet understood magnetic instability.@xcite hence , the competition between superconductivity and magnetism observed in iron pnictides is clearly extended to these iron chalcogenides , and the current picture seems to be that superconductivity arises in a phase with strong magnetic character . here",
    "we focus on a crucial feature : se vacancies are necessary for producing the high temperature superconducting state , so what is the character of this defect ?    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table2 ]      one may ask : how stable is this antialigned local spin state ? fixed spin moment calculations@xcite in the fe@xmath21se@xmath22 compound are used to investigate this question .",
    "results can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fsm ] , which shows the expected energy minimum around the half - metallic solution with 0.5 @xmath23/fe ( 4 @xmath23 per magnetic cluster ) .",
    "note that the e(@xmath24 ) curve is not smooth at a point of half metallicity@xcite where a substantial range of  applied field \" leads to the same unchanging moment . for total moment @xmath24=0",
    ", two solutions are found : the antialigned spin state with net zero moment and the simple nonmagnetic state .",
    "the antialigned state has lower energy by 65 ( 37 in fplo ) mev / fe than the nonmagnetic state , but higher energy by 71 mev / fe than the half metallic state .",
    "however , the nonmagnetic solution is more stable than any solution with parallel aligned spins .",
    "these results indicate that parallel spins are strongly antagonistic for this magnetic cluster ; the local coupling is afm .    for antialigned spin states , the difference in total energy between the two codes used here",
    "is associated with different local moments on fe ions .",
    "these differences between two all - electron , full potential codes which usually give equivalent results reaffirm the strong sensitivity of the system to small effects . at @xmath24=0 and 0.25 @xmath23 ,",
    "the moment of fe1 obtained in wien2k is about 15% larger than in fplo , though the ratio of fe local moments is nearly identical .",
    "these differences probably reflect the sensitivity of fese@xmath0the softness of its magnetism  to small computational details rather than representing distinct magnetic states .",
    "additionally , changing the total moment for the antialigned spin states , the fe1 moment is insensitive , with only a maximum change of 10% , whereas the fe2 moment varies rapidly . from such behavior",
    "we can conclude that low energy excitations involve essentially little change in the fe1 magnetic moment .      to check the robustness of this vacancy induced magnetic cluster , we carried out analogous calculations for fete@xmath0 and bafe@xmath5as@xmath5 .",
    "a similar structural relaxation was performed for fete@xmath25 as in fese,@xcite and an as vacancy in bafe@xmath5as@xmath5 , _ i.e. _ ba@xmath26fe@xmath21as@xmath22 given in table [ table2 ] .",
    "for bafe@xmath5as@xmath27 and fete@xmath25 , the relaxation and magnetic cluster are similar although the final states are not half metallic , with total moment of 0.7 @xmath23/fe and 0.42 @xmath23/fe , respectively .",
    "these magnetic states are favored energetically over the nonmagnetic state by about 160 mev / fe for bafe@xmath5as@xmath27 and 175 mev / fe for fete@xmath25 .",
    "now we consider the broader context .",
    "magnetism in superconducting samples , and its possible connection to superconductivity , is one of the primary issues in iron - pnictide superconductivity , and our calculations establish that se ( or te , or as ) vacancies promote strong magnetic clusters surrounding the vacancy .",
    "superconductivity occurs only in substoichiometric samples , and we obtain strong magnetic behavior only around se vacancies .",
    "our fixed spin moment results indicate the low energy excitations will involve fluctuations in the magnitude of the next neighbor fe spin ( relative to the vacancy ) , while the near neighbor spin remains rigid and antialigned .",
    "the character of this excitation is antiparamagon - like but with short correlation length , a scenario that also seems relevant for the iron pnictide superconductors .    in the superconducting fese@xmath28 materials",
    "there is a magnetic transition characterized by a sharp upturn in the susceptibility ( apparently also with a structural aspect ) near 105 k , followed by another transition at 75 k where the susceptibility abruptly returns to its higher temperature value.@xcite these anomalies have not been discussed much yet , but the strong magnetic character , and the difference in field - cooled and zero - field - cooled susceptibility at lower temperature may be reflecting complex cluster - glass behavior arising from the immobile but interacting magnetic defects that we have studied .",
    "the appearance of superconductivity in a disordered magnetic system such as this provides strong justification for further study of the physics of the fese@xmath0 system .",
    "we acknowledge s .- g . lee for useful discussion about samples and s. leb@xmath29gue for useful communications .",
