    "low mass stars ( i.e. , stars of solar mass or lower ) are fascinating objects . during their main sequence ( ms ) lifetime ,",
    "these stars have a convectively unstable region located beneath the surface ( and extending all the way to the center for @xmath6 @xmath3 ) , where large scale magnetic fields are generated through the dynamo mechanism ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this interior structure is reminiscent of that of the sun , with which they share many properties : strong surface magnetic fields ( @xmath7@xmath8 kg , see @xcite ) ; the host of phenomena usually referred to as magnetic activity ( e.g. starspots , _ faculae _ , flares , @xmath9 ) , a manifestation of magnetically heated upper atmosphere @xcite ; a non - trivial rotational evolution , driven by the braking torque applied to the stellar surface by magnetized winds @xcite .",
    "furthermore , m type stars ( @xmath10 ) are the most abundant objects in the galaxy , making up almost @xmath11 in number of its stellar content , and are very promising candidates for the search of exoplanets located in the so - called habitable zone @xcite .",
    "a solid theoretical understanding of the fundamental parameters of low mass stars , leading to precise characterization of these objects from the available observables ( e.g. , mass  magnitude , mass  radius relations ) is therefore very valuable .",
    "a long standing issue in the theory of low mass stars is the disagreement between theoretically - derived and observed global parameters .",
    "discrepancies in radius and effective temperature have been known to exist for a very long time ( e.g. , @xcite ; see also @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the most precise observational constraints on the mass  radius relation of stars have been traditionally provided by the light curve analysis of detached eclipsing binaries ( debs ) . in these systems , masses and",
    "radii of the components can be determined from the light curve analysis very accurately ( a few percent ) and free of additional assumptions . until recently , only a handful of such very valuable systems hosting stars in the low mass range were known @xcite .",
    "however , the situation has improved significantly in the last few years @xcite ; moreover , the number of debs of known parameters can be expected to further increase in the near future , as a by - product of planet - searching missions , such as _",
    "kepler_.    in debs , inflated radii and cooler effective temperatures in comparison with the theoretical models are commonly reported ( by @xmath12@xmath13 and @xmath14@xmath15 , respectively , see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the radius and effective temperature discrepancies roughly compensate each other to give the same luminosity of the model , suggesting a surface origin of the phenomenon .",
    "due to unavailability of theoretical models and/or reliable observational constraints on the chemical composition of the stars , fitting of debs has often been attempted in the past making use of solar metallicity models only .",
    "taking into account the metallicity information , @xcite were able to bring the radius discrepancy down to more moderate levels ( around or below @xmath16 for their entire sample ) .",
    "the radius inflation is usually explained as the consequence of an enhanced level of magnetic activity ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "stars in deb systems can be kept in a regime of fast rotation through the spin - orbit synchronization induced by tidal interactions .",
    "the high rotation rate generates strong magnetic fields via dynamo action @xcite , which in turn lead to high star spots coverage of the surface and suppression of convection within the star @xcite .",
    "both these effects limit the flux of energy throughout the star , which expands in response .",
    "however , since magnetic activity is enhanced by fast rotation , close - in orbit debs , provided they are old enough to have synchronized their rotation periods with the orbital period , should display larger discrepancy than long period systems .",
    "this is not always the case , as both short period , non - discrepant systems ( e.g. koi-126 , @xmath17 d , @xcite ) and long period , discrepant ones ( e.g. kepler 16 , @xmath18 d @xcite ) are known .",
    "the constraints on the fundamental parameters of stars coming from debs have recently been complemented by the direct interferometric determinations of stellar radii .",
    "this technique can now reach a precision on the radius comparable to that of light curve analysis in debs @xcite ; the mass , however , can not be obtained independently of other measurements ( e.g. , empirical mass  magnitude relations ) .",
    "nevertheless , these measurements can provide very valuable information on whether radius and effective temperature deviations exist in single stars . since no magnetic activity enhancement mechanism via tidal interaction with a companion",
    "can be expected in this case , field stars of solar age and approximately solar mass should show very moderate or no radius discrepancy .",
    "a @xmath19 radius deviation with respect to the models of @xcite has been found by @xcite ; however , this result has been challenged by @xcite .",
    "we present a grid of models in the mass range @xmath1@xmath20 calculated for various choices of the metallicity and the mixing length parameter .",
    "one of our goals is to extend and update the low mass end of the yale - yonsei ( y@xmath21 ) isochrones @xcite .",
    "our present calculations rely on up - to - date input physics , capable of reproducing accurately the conditions of stars at the low mass end of the range ( e.g. , high density / low temperature eos , surface boundary conditions based on realistic model atmospheres ) .",
    "this work is also intended as the starting point of a series of papers on related topics .",
    "one planned application is the study of the rotational evolution of solar - like and very low mass stars and in particular the physical mechanisms providing rotational coupling in stellar interiors ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we have thus calculated rotation - related quantities , such as the moments of inertia of the radiative and convective zones of the stars , as well as the convective turnover time scale .",
    "the latter is a global measure of the efficiency of convection and has been often used as a means to connect stellar rotation and activity ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "secondly , we will investigate the effect of variable convective efficiency in stellar 1d models .",
    "in conventional stellar models , convection is described by means of the classical mixing length theory ( mlt , @xcite ) .",
    "the so - called mixing length parameter @xmath4 , the ratio between the mixing length itself and the local pressure scale height , is a measure of the efficiency of convection , and , being a free parameter in the mlt , is typically calibrated on the sun .",
    "there is increasing evidence , however , that the use of a solar - calibrated mixing length is not warranted for other stars , and that @xmath4 should be tied to stellar properties instead @xcite .",
    "theoretical investigations of these effects , with the goal of formulating prescriptions that could be incorporated in 1d models , are well under way ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "a reduction of convective efficiency has also been proposed as the main global effect on stellar structure of the presence of magnetic fields .",
    "this effect has been taken phenomenologically into account by , e.g. , @xcite , using an effective value of @xmath4 , reduced in comparison with its solar - calibrated value .",
    "a more quantitative approach , where the reduction of @xmath4 is connected with the vertical magnetic field intensity according to the formulation of @xcite , has been adopted by @xcite .",
    "finally , the formalism developed by @xcite in an early attempt at a self - consistent @xmath22 modeling of the sun with magnetic fields was recently applied to the deb system ef aquarii by @xcite .",
    "further theoretical efforts along these lines are a natural continuation of our present investigation on the radius discrepancy problem",
    ". our grid will also be useful in those studies where knowledge of a precise mass  radius theoretical relationship is crucial .",
    "for example , in the characterization of exoplanet - hosting systems , the accuracy in the determination of the mass and the radius of the planets is contingent on that of the hosting star ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the present paper ,",
    "we investigate the ( theoretical vs. observational ) relationships among the fundamental parameters of low mass stars .",
    "our aim is to shed light on the nature of the physical mechanisms producing the radius and effective temperature discrepancies in low mass stars , by disentangling the intrinsic disagreement from that caused by other effects ( e.g. , age and/or metallicity uncertainties ) , and by ascertaining whether the observational data on binaries and single stars ( from debs and interferometry , respectively ) can be reconciled within a consistent paradigm . to this end",
    ", we compare our models with the two largest samples currently available that contain low mass stars and satisfy a high accuracy criterion ( i.e. the compilation of debs by @xcite and the interferometric measurements by @xcite , respectively ) .",
    "all the models were calculated using the yale rotational stellar evolution code ( yrec ) in its non - rotational configuration .",
    "compared with the standard version of yrec ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the code used in this work contains some major improvements .",
    "the most important ones concern the treatment of the equation of state and the use of outer boundary conditions based on updated non - grey atmospheric models ( see sect .  [",
    "sec : surfbc ] below ) .",
    "these improvements are particularly significant when modelling low mass objects , i.e. for @xmath23 . our present calculations ,",
    "therefore , supersede the y@xmath21 models in this range of mass .",
    "the details of the input physics are as follows .",
    "we used @xcite opacities at low temperatures , and the opal rosseland opacities at high temperatures @xcite ; the equation of state ( eos ) is the opal  2005 eos @xcite .",
    "the energy generation rates are calculated according to the prescription of @xcite ; diffusion of helium and heavy elements is taken into account , with the diffusion coefficients calculated according to the prescription of @xcite .",
    "convection is described with the mixing length theory ( mlt ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; the value used for the mlt parameter @xmath4 ( the mixing length scaled over the pressure scale height ) is discussed below ( see sect .  [ thegrid ] ) . in all calculations ,",
    "we adopt the @xcite value of the solar metallicity , @xmath24 and an @xmath4-enhancement @xmath25=0 $ ] .",
    "convective core overshooting is not necessary in modeling stars in the mass range consider here and therefore it is not taken into account .",
    "the standard treatment of the atmospheric boundary conditions in yrec relies on the specification of a temperature - optical depth ( @xmath26@xmath27 ) relationship ( typically , the one of the classical eddington grey atmosphere model or the empirical one from * ? ? ?",
    "however , although this approximation is adequate for stars of solar mass or higher , it can lead to significant errors in the determination of the stellar radius and effective temperature for stars of mass @xmath28 ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) . since the mass range we wish to investigate extends below this limit , we incorporated in the standard version of yrec , described so far , the improvements discussed in @xcite : the use of the scvh eos @xcite in the low temperature  high density regime , and of the surface boundary conditions derived from phoenix model atmospheres @xcite .    in the current yrec implementation , the opal and scvh eos",
    "are ramped at @xmath29 k. for the surface boundary conditions , the value of the gas pressure at the stellar photosphere is interpolated from a table compiled from the phoenix atmosphere models . to achieve overall consistency within the grid",
    ", we used the surface boundary conditions derived from phoenix throughout the entire mass range covered .",
    "the original input tables used by @xcite , generated from nextgen models @xcite , were updated to include the new bt - settl models @xcite , available from f. allard s web page , and to account for non - solar metallicities .",
    "as the bt - settl models are only available for either the @xcite or the @xcite chemical compositions , complete consistency can not be achieved with the composition we adopted for the interior calculations ( i.e. that of @xcite ) .",
    "we have used the bt - settl atmosphere models with @xcite mixture , which is the closest to our choice for the interior .",
    "the interior and atmosphere models are matched according to the value of @xmath30}$ ] ( i.e. , they will not have exactly the same value of @xmath31 or of @xmath32 ) . the relative difference between the @xcite and the @xcite value of @xmath33",
    "is however , quite small ( about @xmath34 ) .",
    "moreover , the difference in @xmath32 will only have second order effects on the stellar models , as a change in the atmospheric @xmath32 will result in a change in the value of the photospheric pressure used in the outer boundary conditions , and this , in turn , will affect the stellar model .",
    "a comparison of the evolutionary tracks in the hr diagram obtained using the surface boundary conditions from nextgen and from bt - settl models is shown in figure  [ fig : ngvsbt ] .",
    "although the effects on the isochrone shown are rather modest , the differences in the pre - main sequence ( pms ) tracks are non - negligible , especially for the lowest masses .",

    "currently , the available observations which satisfy this requirement are from two main sources : light curve analysis of debs and interferometric measurement of stellar radii .",
    "debs provide a very tight constraint on the mass  radius relationship , since both quantities can be determined directly , usually with an accuracy within a few percent ; knowledge of other parameters of the system , such as age or metallicity , or of the components , such as effective temperatures or luminosities , although very valuable , is rarely available or equally accurate .",

    "* ) , it is a remarkably reliable approximation of stellar convection in the deep layers @xcite .",

    "once a constant ( i.e. , mass - independent ) scale factor is accounted for , our calculations are in remarkably close agreement with those of @xcite . for the other two sets of @xmath123 , the scale factor depends on mass .",
    "this is most likely the consequence of different choices in the input physics to which stellar models have different sensitivity according to their mass , e.g. , the treatment of the atmospheric boundary conditions .",
    "it should also be noted that both the @xcite and the @xcite models take stellar rotation into account , which affects more strongly more massive models than less massive ones @xcite .",
    "to construct synthetic color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) , we need to transform from the theoretical variables @xmath127 to colors .",
