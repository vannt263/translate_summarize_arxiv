    "_  introduced a conserved lattice gas ( clg ) with a stochastic short range interaction that exhibits a continuous phase transition from an active state to an absorbing non - active state at a critical value of the particle density  @xcite .",
    "the clg model is expected to belong to a new universality class of absorbing phase transitions characterized by a conserved field .",
    "similar to the well known universality hypothesis of directed percolation  @xcite the authors conjectured that `` all stochastic models with an infinite number of absorbing states in which the order parameter evolution is coupled to a nondiffusive conserved field define a unique universality class ''  @xcite . in order to check this hypothesis the scaling behavior ,",
    "i.e.  the values of the corresponding critical exponents , has to be determined .",
    "the order parameter exponent as well as the exponent of the order parameter fluctuations were determined in  @xcite .",
    "furthermore a modified clg model with random particle hopping was introduced in  @xcite which mimics the mean - field scaling behavior of the system .    in this work we investigated for the first time the clg model in an external field .",
    "the external field is conjugated to the order parameter , i.e.  it is realized as a spontaneous creation of active particles .",
    "of course a spontaneous creation of active particles destroys the absorbing state and thus the absorbing phase transition at all . but",
    "analogous to ferromagnetic phase transitions the order parameter can be described as a generalized homogeneous function of the control parameter and of the conjugated field in the critical regime .",
    "this scaling behavior is examined below ( @xmath2 ) , above ( @xmath3 ) , and at the so - called upper critical dimension ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "we consider the clg model on @xmath5-dimensional cubic lattices of linear size  @xmath6 .",
    "initially one distributes randomly @xmath7 particles on the system where @xmath8 denotes the particle density . in order to mimic a repulsive interaction a given particle",
    "is considered as _ active _ if at least one of its @xmath9 neighboring sites on the cubic lattice is occupied by another particle .",
    "if all neighboring sites are empty the particle remains _",
    "inactive_. active particles are moved in the next update step to one of their empty nearest neighbor sites , selected at random . in the steady state ,",
    "the system is characterized by the density of active sites @xmath10 .",
    "the density @xmath10 is the order parameter of the absorbing phase transition , i.e. , it vanishes if the control parameter @xmath8 is lower than the critical value @xmath11 . in the thermodynamic limit the order parameter scales for zero field and for @xmath12 as @xmath13 with @xmath14 .    in this work",
    "we consider the clg model in an external field  @xmath15 conjugated to the order parameter , i.e. , the field spontaneously creates active particles .",
    "clearly the particular implementation of the spontaneous creation of active particles has to obey the particle conservation of the clg model which is believed to be a relevant parameter , determining the universality class . instead of a creation of additional particles",
    "we realize the external field by particle movements which do not change the total number of particles .",
    "therefore we choose randomly @xmath16 particles on the lattice .",
    "each of these particles is then moved to one of its empty next neighbors . in this way",
    "inactive particles may be activated and the number of active sites is increased .    in our simulations",
    "we start with randomly distributed particles .",
    "the system is updated according to the above rules in the following way .",

    "then one moves @xmath16 randomly chosen inactive particles to one of its empty next neighbors . in the case",
    "that these movements create active particles , these particles are added to the list of active particles and will be updated in the following update step .",
    "thus one update step contains both , the update of active sites and the additional movements of inactive particles which mimics the external field .     as a function of time ( number of update steps ) for two different values of the external field  @xmath15 . after a certain relaxation time",

    "the system reaches a steady state where the density of active sites fluctuates around the average value @xmath17 which is interpreted as the order parameter @xmath18 . decreasing the external field below a certain value",
    "finite - size effects occur which results in strong fluctuations .",
    "two of these strong fluctuations events can be seen in the lower curve of fig.[fig : rho_a_field_equil_01 ] .",
    "the origin of these effects is that the number of particle movements ( @xmath16 ) create too few active particles and the system tends to the absorbing state . as a results the measured order parameter",
    "is shifted to lower values . to avoid these finite - size effects we increase the system size before these fluctuation events occur .",
