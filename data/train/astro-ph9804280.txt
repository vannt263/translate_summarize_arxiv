    "the existence of a filamentary , low - density intergalactic medium ( igm ) which contains the bulk of the hydrogen and helium in the universe is predicted as a product of primordial nucleosynthesis and of hierarchical models of gravitational instability with `` cold dark matter '' ( cdm ) ( cen 1994 ; zhang 1995 ; hernquist 1996 ) .",
    "the application of the gunn - peterson constraint on the amount of smoothly distributed neutral material along the line of sight to distant objects requires the hydrogen component of the diffuse igm to have been highly ionized by @xmath4 ( schneider 1991 ) , and the helium component by @xmath6 ( davidsen 1996 ) .",
    "it thus appears that substantial sources of ultraviolet photons were present at @xmath7 , perhaps low - luminosity quasars or a first generation of stars in virialized dark matter halos with @xmath8k ( couchman & rees 1986 ; ostriker & gnedin 1996 ; haiman & loeb 1997 ; miralda - escud & rees 1997 ) .",
    "early star formation provides a possible explanation for the widespread existence of heavy elements in the igm ( cowie 1995 ) , while reionization by qsos may produce a detectable signal in the radio extragalactic background at meter wavelengths ( madau 1997 ) .",
    "establishing the character of cosmological ionizing sources is an efficient way to constrain competing models for structure formation in the universe , and to study the collapse and cooling of small mass objects at early epochs . while the nature , spectrum , and intensity of the background uv flux which is responsible for maintaining the intergalactic gas and the ly@xmath9 clouds in a highly ionized state at @xmath10 has been the subject of much debate in the last decade , it is only in the past few years that new observations have provided reliable information on the presence and physical properties of the sources and sinks ( due to continuum opacities ) of uv radiation in the interval @xmath11 .    in this talk",
    "i will focus on the candidate sources of photoionization at early times and on the time - dependent reionization problem , i.e. on the history of the transition from a neutral igm to one that is almost fully ionized .",
    "the starting point of this study can be found perhaps in the simple realization that the _ breakthrough epoch _ ( when all radiation sources can see each other in the lyman continuum ) occurs much later in the universe than the _ overlap epoch _",
    "( when individual ionized zones become simply connected and every point in space is exposed to ionizing radiation ) , and that at high redshifts the ionization equilibrium is actually determined by the _ instantaneous _",
    "uv production rate . in the following",
    "i will adopt an einstein - de sitter universe ( @xmath12 ) with @xmath13 .",
    "the complete reionization of the universe manifests itself in the absence of a gunn - peterson absorption trough in galaxies and quasars at @xmath14 . in the presence of a uniform medium of density @xmath15 along the path to a distant object ,",
    "the optical depth associated with resonant scattering at @xmath16 is @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the hubble constant , @xmath19 is the oscillator strength of the transition , and all other symbols have their usual meaning .",
    "the strongest limit on the amount of diffuse intergalactic neutral hydrogen at @xmath20 is provided by a direct estimate of the quasar q12020725 flux in regions of the spectrum where lines are absent ( giallongo 1994 ) : the method yields @xmath21 . even if 99% of all the cosmic baryons fragment at these epochs into structures that can be identified with discrete absorption lines , with only 1% remaining in a smoothly distributed component ( cf .",
    "zhang 1998 ) , these measurements imply a diffuse igm which is ionized to better than 1 part in @xmath22 .",
    "it is useful to start the discussion with the last stage of the reionization process , when individual ionized zones have overlapped , the reionization of hydrogen ( and helium ) in the universe has been completed , and the igm has been exposed everywhere to lyman continuum photons .",
    "an often overlooked point is worth remarking here , namely the fact that even if the bulk of the baryons in the universe are fairly well ionized at @xmath14 , the neutral hydrogen still present in the numerous ly@xmath9 forest clouds and the rarer lyman - limit systems ( lls ) along the line of sight significantly attenuates the ionizing flux from cosmologically distant sources . in other words , while the complete overlapping of i - fronts occurs at @xmath23 , the universe does not become optically thin to lyman continuum photons until much later , at a `` breakthrough '' redshift @xmath24 .",
    "it is only after breakthrough that any point in space at any redshift @xmath25 will be exposed to ionizing photons from all radiation sources out to @xmath26 .",
    "the radiative transfer equation in cosmology describes the evolution in time of the specific intensity @xmath27 of a diffuse radiation field : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the cosmological scale parameter , @xmath30 the speed of the light , @xmath31 the continuum absorption coefficient per unit length along the line of sight , and @xmath32 is the proper space - averaged volume emissivity .",
    "the mean ( averaged over all lines of sight ) specific intensity of the radiation background at the observed frequency @xmath33 , as seen by an observer at redshift @xmath34 , is then @xmath35 where @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is the line element in a friedmann cosmology .",
    "the effective optical depth @xmath38 due to discrete absorption systems is defined , for poisson - distributed clouds , as @xmath39 ( paresce 1980 ) , where @xmath40 is the redshift and column density distribution of absorbers along the line of sight , and @xmath41 is the lyman continuum optical depth through an individual cloud .",
    "the actual distribution of intervening clouds is still quite uncertain , especially in the range @xmath42 , where most of the contribution to the effective photoelectric opacity actually occurs . as a function of column",
    ", a single power - law with slope @xmath43 appears to provide a surprisingly good description over nearly 10 decades in @xmath44 ( e.g. hu 1995 ) . at high redshifts , it is a good approximation to use for the distribution of absorbers : @xmath45 for simplicity , i will assume here a single redshift exponent , @xmath46 , for the entire range in column densities .",
    "a normalization value of @xmath47 produces about 3 lls per unit redshift at @xmath48 , as observed by stengler - larrea ( 1995 ) , and , at the same epoch , @xmath49 lines above @xmath50 , in good agreement with the estimates of kim ( 1997 ) . with this normalization and @xmath46",
    ", the adopted distribution provides about the same photoelectic opacity as in the model discussed by haardt & madau ( 1996 ) .",
    "if one extrapolates the @xmath51 power - law in equation ( [ eq : dis ] ) to very small and large columns , the effective optical depth becomes an analytical function of redshift and wavelength , @xmath52 ,   \\label{eq : t}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is the hydrogen photoionization cross - section at the lyman edge @xmath54 , and we have not included the contribution of helium to the attenuation along the line of sight .",
    "it is practical , for the present discussion , to define a redshift @xmath55 such that the effective optical depth between @xmath34 and @xmath56 is unity .",
    "when @xmath57 , a photon emitted at @xmath56 with frequency @xmath58 will be redshifted below threshold before being significantly attenuated by intervening . from equation ( [ eq : t ] ) , it can be shown that the universe will be optically thin below @xmath59^{1/3}}-1.\\ ] ] this expression has a minimum for @xmath60 , corresponding to what we shall term in the following the `` breakthrough epoch '' of the universe , @xmath61 .",
    "it is only for @xmath25 that the degree of ionization of the igm will be determined by the balance between radiative recombinations and the total ionizing flux emitted by all qsos which appear after @xmath62 .",
    "by contrast , due to the rapid increase in the number of intervening absorbers with lookback time , beyond a redshift of 2 the mean free path of photons at @xmath63  becomes so small that the radiation is largely `` local '' , as sources at higher redshifts are severely absorbed .",
    "expanding equation ( [ eq : t ] ) around @xmath48 , for example , one gets @xmath64 for @xmath65 .",
    "this corresponds to a proper distance or `` absorption length '' of only @xmath66 in the local ( or `` source - function '' ) solution to the equation of radiative transfer , this strong attenuation effect is approximated by simply ignoring sources with @xmath67 and neglecting absorption for those sources with @xmath68 .. ]   since only emitters within the volume defined by an absorption length contribute significantly to the background intensity shortward of the lyman edge , cosmological effects such as source evolution and frequency shifts can be neglected , and the number of ionizing photons per unit proper volume at @xmath69 can be written as @xmath70 where @xmath71 , and @xmath72 is an average over the the incident photon spectrum .",
    ", one has @xmath73 , where @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and we have assumed a cutoff at 4 ryd because of absorption . a spectrum with @xmath76 yields @xmath77 .",
    "]   the small absorption length is mostly due to systems with continuum optical depth @xmath78 . within the assumption that all absorbers are optically thin , highly ionized in both h and he , and contain most of the baryons of the universe , it is possible to derive a relation between the mean absorption length and the gas recombination time @xmath79 from the equation of ionization equilibrium , @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the volume - averaged hydrogen density of the expanding igm , @xmath82 @xmath83 , @xmath84^{-1}=1.5\\ , { \\rm gyr } \\left({\\omega_b",
    "h_{50}^2 \\over 0.06}\\right)^{-1}\\left({1+z\\over 4}\\right)^{-3 } c_{10}^{-1},\\ ] ] @xmath85 is the recombination coefficient to the excited states of hydrogen , @xmath86 the helium to hydrogen cosmic abundance ratio , @xmath87 is the ionized hydrogen clumping factor ,  and we assumed a gas temperature of @xmath88k .",
    "an empirical determination of the clumpiness of the igm at high redshifts is hampered by our poor knowledge of the ionizing background intensity and the typical size and geometry of the absorbers .",
    "numerical n - body / hydrodynamics simulations of structure formation in the igm within the framework of cdm dominated cosmologies have recently provided a definite picture for the origin of intervening absorption systems , one of an interconnected network of sheets and filaments , with virialized systems located at their points of intersection . in the simulations of gnedin & ostriker ( 1997 ) , for example",
    ", the clumping factor rises above unity when the collapsed fraction of baryons becomes significant , i.e. @xmath89 , and grows to @xmath90 ( 40 ) at @xmath91 ( 5 ) ( because of finite resolution effects , numerical simulations will actually underestimate clumping ) .",
    "the recombination time is then much shorter than that for a uniform igm .",
    "in the rest of this talk i will show how a simple formalism can shed some light on the time - dependent reionization process , and assess the role of quasars and star - forming galaxies as candidate sources of photoionization at high redshifts .",
    "when an isolated point source of ionizing radiation turns on , the ionized volume initially grows in size at a rate fixed by the emission of uv photons , and an ionization front separating the and regions propagates into the neutral gas .",
    "most photons travel freely in the ionized bubble , and are absorbed in a transition layer . across the i - front the degree of ionization changes sharply on a distance of the order of the mean free path of an ionizing photon . when @xmath92 , the growth of the region is slowed down by recombinations in the highly inhomogeneous igm , and its evolution can be decoupled from the expansion of the universe . just like in the static case ,",
    "the ionized bubble will fill its time - varying strmgren sphere after a few recombination timescales .",
    "the filling factor of regions in the universe , @xmath93 , is , at any given instant @xmath94 , equal to the integral over cosmic time of the rate of ionizing photons emitted per hydrogen atom and unit cosmological volume by all radiation sources present at earlier epochs , @xmath95 _ minus _ the rate of radiative recombinations , @xmath96 differentiating , one gets @xmath97 it is this simple differential equation  and its equivalent for expanding helium zones  that _ statistically describes the transition from a neutral universe to a fully ionized one _ , independently , for a given emissivity , of the complex and possibly short - lived emission histories of individual radiation sources , e.g. , on whether their comoving space density is constant or actually varies with cosmic time ( cf arons & wingert 1972 ) . in the case of a time - independent clumping factor ,",
    "equation ( [ eq : qdot ] ) has formal solution @xmath98 with @xmath99 . at high redshifts , and for",
    "an igm with @xmath100 , one can expand around @xmath94 to find @xmath101 the porosity of ionized bubbles is approximately given then by the _ number of ionizing photons emitted per hydrogen atom in one recombination time_. in other words , because of hydrogen recombinations , only a fraction @xmath102 ( @xmath103 a few per cent at @xmath104 ) of the photons emitted above 1 ryd is actually used to ionize new igm material .",
    "the universe is completely reionized when @xmath105 , i.e. when @xmath106 figure 1 shows the ( and ) filling factor as a function of redshift for a qso photoionization model and a clumpy igm with @xmath107 and 35 . the transition from a neutral to a ionized universe takes place too late in this model , as late as @xmath108 for @xmath109 , and never before @xmath110 even in the limiting case of a uniform medium .",
    "we can better quantify now the inadequacy of known sources of radiation to provide the required amount lyman continuum photons at @xmath4 .",
    "because of the local character of the uv background at high redshifts , one can compute at any given epoch a critical value for the photon emission rate per unit cosmological comoving volume , @xmath111 , independently of the ( unknown ) previous emission history of the universe : only rates above this value will provide enough uv photons to keep the igm ionized at epoch .",
    "one can then compare our determinations of @xmath112 to the estimated contribution from qsos and star - forming galaxies .",
    "we have seen in the previous sections that only photons emitted within one recombination timescales or , equivalently , within one attenuation length of any fluid element in the universe can actually be used in the equation of ionization equilibrium . equation ( [ eq : q1 ] ) can then be rewritten as @xmath113 , or @xmath114 where a spectral index of @xmath76 has been assumed for the volume emissivity between 1 and 4 ryd .",
    "the uncertainty on this critical rate is difficult to estimate , as it depends on the statistics of intervening absorbers and the nucleosynthesis constrained baryon density .",
    "a quick exploration of the available parameter space indicates that the uncertainty on @xmath115 is unlikely to exceed @xmath116 in the log .",
    "the evolution of the critical rate as a function of redshift is plotted in figure 2 : @xmath111 is higher than the quasar contribution already at @xmath117 . at @xmath104 ,",
    "the deficit of lyman continuum photons is about an order of magnitude .",
    "for relatively bright galaxies to produce enough uv radiation at @xmath104 , their space density would have to be comparable to the one observed at @xmath5 , with most ionizing photons being able to escape freely from the regions of star formation into the igm .",
    "this scenario appears quite improbable , in light of the decrease in the uv galaxy emissivity observed in the hdf above @xmath118 ( madau 1996 ) and of direct observations of local starbursts below the lyman limit showing that at most a few percent of the stellar ionizing radiation produced by these sources actually escapes into the igm ( leitherer 1995 ) .",
    "it is interesting to convert the derived value of @xmath111 at @xmath104 into a star formation rate per unit ( comoving ) volume , @xmath119 : @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the unknown fraction of lyman continuum photons from o stars which escapes the galaxy layers into the igm .",
    "the conversion factor assumes a salpeter imf with solar metallicity , and has been computed using bruzual & charlot ( 1998 ) population synthesis code .",
    "if dwarf galaxies associated with @xmath122 km s@xmath123 dark matter halos are responsible for ionizing the universe at @xmath104 , and are able to convert a fraction @xmath124 of their total mass into stars over a timescale of order the free - fall time of the halo , it can be shown then that their comoving space density must be approximately @xmath125 at least several hundred times larger than the space density of present - day @xmath126 galaxies ."
