    "the three - dimensional topological insulators ( tis ) have attracted much attention recently due to the intriggering fundemental physics as well as the possible application in the ti devices.@xcite ti has a gapped insulating bulk but gappless conducting surface states whose low energy ones can be described as massless dirac fermions .",
    "the discovery of the strong ti materials such as bi@xmath0se@xmath1 , which has a bulk gap on the order of 300  mev , are of particular interest since it indicates the feasibility of the room temperature devices .",
    "the surface states of the strong ti materials near the dirac points have been experimentally measured by the spin - angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy.@xcite however , the signature of the surface states has yet to be separated from the bulk ones in the transport experiments . due to the relatively small gap",
    ", it is commonly believed that the bulk states have strong influence on the charge transport,@xcite even when the fermi level resides inside the bulk gap.@xcite however , without a clear understanding of surface transport , it is premature to distinguish the surface transport from the bulk one .    recently , costache _ et al .",
    "_ reported the experimental investigation on the charge transport on the surface of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 under high electric fields.@xcite in the experiment , it is observed that the current increases with the applied voltage in low voltage regime , then shows a tendency of saturation at the intermediate regime .",
    "however , the current saturation is not complete .",
    "when the voltage further increases to about 50  mv , the current rises again . for conductance",
    ", it undergoes slight change in the small voltage regime , then a quick reduction in the intermediate one , and finally saturates in the high applied voltage regime ( larger than 50  mv ) .",
    "the current saturation or the conductance reduction is attributed to the inelastic electron - optical - phonon scattering in the surface states .",
    "the finite saturated conductance in the high voltage regime , however , is speculated to be the contribution from the bulk ones .",
    "it is argued that due to band bending , the energy gap of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 is reduced to be 50  mev from the original 300  mev .",
    "therefore , when the applied voltage is higher than 50  mv , the carriers are excited from surface bands to the bulk band which has finite conductance.@xcite however , this argument is valid only when the transport is nearly ballistic so that the carriers in the surface bands can have enough energy gain to be excited to the bulk bands .",
    "however , for the diffusive transport in the experimental setup , the average energy gain is estimated to be less than 4  mev when the applied voltage is 50  mv .",
    "this indicates that the excitation of carriers from the surface bands to the bulk one is very unlikely to have significant effect on the transport even if the energy gap is indeed reduced to 50  mev .",
    "therefore , the incomplete saturation and the finite residual conductance are unlikely from the bulk contribution .    theoretically , the charge and spin transports of the surface state in bi@xmath0se@xmath1 have been investigated@xcite with most of the studies focusing on the linear transport regime .",
    "zhang and wu have carried out the study on the hot - electron transport under strong electric field of the surface states in bi@xmath0se@xmath1 by solving the kinetic spin bloch equations ( ksbes).@xcite it is shown that the mobility , and hence the conductance , decreases with increasing applied electric field due to the hot - electron effect .",
    "moreover , it is further shown that the electric field can excite carriers on the surface from the valance to the conduction bands through the interband precession .",
    "the excited carriers also contribute to the charge transport , thus lead to an enhanced conductance . combining these two results ,",
    "it is possible to understand the qualitative dependence of the current and the conductance on the applied voltage within the framework of the surface transport _ alone_. in this paper , we show that the main features of the experimental results , i.e. , the incomplete current saturation and the finite residual conductance , can indeed be captured by the surface transport _ alone _ , even though the bulk does have non - neglectable contribution to the total conductance . this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",

    "[ results ] , we show that the main features of the experimental results , such as the incomplete saturation of current and the finite residual conductance at high applied field , can be captured by the surface transport alone .",
    "moreover , we show that one can obtain a good agreement between the experimental results and theoretical calculation by introducing a constant bulk conductance that does not change with the applied voltage .",

    "one can see that our theoretical results capture all the main experimental results qualitatively .",
    "namely , the current @xmath64 increases linearly with the increase of the voltage @xmath65 when the voltage is small ; then the current shows a tendency of saturation at intermediate voltage but increases again when the voltage rises higher than @xmath69  mv .",

    "[ fig : conductance](a ) .",
    "one finds from the figure that , the conductance decreases as the voltage increases then saturates to a finite constant at higher voltage .",
    "the decrease of the conductance is a result of the hot - electron effect at high electric field.@xcite due to the driving of the electric field , the temperature of the electrons raises well above the lattice one when the field is high enough . as a result ,",
    "the electron - phonon scattering is profoundly enhanced , consequently the mobility @xmath71 decreases .",
    "therefore , the conductance @xmath72 decreases with the increase of the voltage . when the field is strong enough , the mobility under electric field @xmath57 is roughly inversely proportional to the electric field @xmath73 .",
    "here @xmath74 is the linear mobility and @xmath75 is a constant that weakly decreases when carrier concentration @xmath76 rises.@xcite one can therefore estimate that the current should saturates to @xmath77 at high voltage .",
    "this current saturation can be crudely captured by the so called steady - state population model with instantaneous phonon emission.@xcite if the saturation is complete as predicted by the steady - state population model , the current should remain constant and the conductance should approach zero under high voltage .",
    "however , our computation shows that at higher applied electric field , the current saturation is not complete . when the voltage further increases the current again rises linearly with the voltage , and the corresponding conductance saturates to a finite value instead of zero .",
    "this incomplete current saturation and the finite residual conductance in the high - field regime is due to the excitation of carriers from the surface valence band to the surface conduction one via the interband precession ( the fourth term in ksbes ) , first proposed by zhang and wu.@xcite in the low field regime , the excitation is proportional to @xmath78 . for sample with a high background carrier density , the number of the excited carriers is too small to have an observable effect on transport properties . in the intermediate regime where the mobility is reduced due to the hot - electron effect but",
    "the carrier excitation is not yet strong enough , the current shows tendency of saturation as the mobility reduces . at higher field regime , when more carriers are excited , the current increases again with the increases of the field . under strong field ,",
    "the excited carrier density is proportional to the electric field @xmath57 , and the total number of the carriers becomes @xmath79 with @xmath80 being a constant . combining with the fact that the mobility is inversely proportional to @xmath57 in this regime , one finds that the conductance @xmath81e\\mu_0 w/[(1+\\gamma(n_e)\\mu_0 e)l].\\ ] ] it is therefore understood that under strong applied electric field / voltage when the number of the excited carriers exceeds the background one , the conductance becomes a finite constant @xmath82.\\ ] ] the saturated field @xmath83 is determined by the equation @xmath84 , i.e. , when the number of the excited carriers becomes the same as the background one .",
    "one can then write down the saturated voltage @xmath85 as @xmath86 which is proportional to the background surface charge density .    if there is no such excitation , the current saturation at high applied field / voltage regime is complete and the conduction approaches zero .",
    "this is verified by our numerical solution , also shown in fig .",

    "if all the electrons occupy the surface states and the bulk does not have any contribution to the charge transport , then the total conductance @xmath70 is the same as the surface one . under this assumption ,",
    "the surface conductance from our computation ( @xmath89 ) , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : conductance](b ) as dashed curve , fits reasonably well with the experimental data in the low field regime when the impurity density is @xmath90  @xmath67 . in the high field regime , however , the theoretical results deviate from the experimental ones .",
    "the theoretical saturated voltage in this case is about 200  mv , much larger than 50  mv from the experiment , and the residual conductance is about 5@xmath91 , 30  % smaller than the experimental one .    according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : saturatedvoltage ] ) , to have a smaller saturated voltage , the background surface charge density should be smaller .",
    "the overall quantitative fitting can indeed be improved if some of the electrons are assumed to be populated in the bulk impurity bands.@xcite in this case , the total conductance @xmath70 is the summation of surface conductance @xmath92 and the bulk one @xmath93 .",
    "since the conductance of the bulk impurity bands is determined by the disorder , @xmath93 can be regarded as a constant that does not variate with the applied voltage in the observed regime.@xcite in fig .",

    "one finds that our numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental data for both low and high applied voltages .",
    "it is noted that we do not consider the excitation of carriers from the surface states to the bulk ones in our calculation .",
    "the charge densities on the surface and in the bulk remain constant and do not change with the applied field / voltage .",
    "since the bulk charge density and the conductance @xmath93 are constant , all the variations in the transport properties are caused solely by the carriers on the surface .",
    "our results suggest that the bulk indeed has a non - negligable contribution to the total conductance .",
    "however , the main transport phenomena , such as the incomplete current saturation and the finite residual conductance under high field , can be understood within the framework of surface transport alone without the influence of the bulk part . in the works of checkelsky _",
    "et al._@xcite and costache _",
    "et al._,@xcite the incomplete current saturation and the finite residual conductance were speculated to be associated with the excitation of the carrier from surface states to the bulk ones which have finite constant conductance .",
    "it is argued that in the experimental setup , the energy gap of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 can be reduced from 300  mev to about 50  mev due to the band bending , thus enabling the carriers on the surface to be excited to the bulk with an applied voltage of 50  mv . for the argument to be valid , the transport must be nearly ballistic so that the carriers in the surface states can gain enough energy to jump over the energy gap .",
    "however , in the experimental setup the mean free path is less than 30  nm .",
    "it means that the average energy gain by the carriers is less than 4  mev for an applied voltage of 50  mv over a sample with a length of 410  nm .",
    "this energy gain is too small to excite the carriers from the surface states to the bulk ones even if the energy gap is indeed reduced to 50  mev .",
    "therefore , the excitation from the surface states to the bulk ones is very unlikely to be the main reason for the incomplete current saturation and the finite residual conductance at high voltage . from our theoretical results ,",
    "the more likely reason for these high - field / voltage transport phenomena is the joint effects of the hot - electron transport and the excitation within the surface bands .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the charge transport on the surface of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 by numerically solving the ksbes and reproduce the main qualitative features of the experimental results , i.e. , the incomplete current saturation and the finite residual conductance in high applied voltage regime , without introducing any bulk contribution . due to the hot - electron effect ,",
    "the electron - phonon scattering is enhanced and leads to a reduced mobility , inversely proportional to the applied field at high field regime . as a result , the current shows tendency of saturation . on the other hand",
    ", the applied electric field can excite carriers from the surface valance band to the surface conduction one due to the interband preccession .",
    "this leads to the increase of the current carrying carriers and thus the increase of current . under high applied voltage ,",
    "the conductance approaches a finite residual value as the number of the excited carriers , being proportional to the electric field , exceeds the background one .",
    "moreover , the theoretical results agree quantitatively well with the experimental data if a constant bulk conductance , which does not change with the applied voltage in the experimental measured regime , is introduced .",
    "this suggests that even though the bulk has a non - neglectable contribution to the the total conductance , the main transport phenomena , such as the incomplete current saturation and the finite residual conductance at high applied voltage / field , can be well understood in the framework of surface transport alone .",
