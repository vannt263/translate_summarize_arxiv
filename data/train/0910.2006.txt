    "the question of an experimental evidence of physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) has been and still is an issue in particle physics .",
    "this topic is especially popular nowadays , when new high - energy experiments are being constructed and put in work . regarding the sm as a low - energy approximation of a more general theory",
    ", one can expect the new physics to manifest itself in two ways : important effects in measurements at high energies or small effects at relatively low energies .",
    "the latter is the case of the muon magnetic anomaly , often referred to as the muon @xmath1 problem . to answer the question ,",
    "whether some new physic plays a role in this case , one needs to achieve a high precision in both , theoretical prediction and experimental measurement .",
    "the muon gyromagnetic ratio relates the muon spin and magnetic momentum @xmath2 and the magnetic anomaly is defined by @xmath3 the higher muon mass makes its magnetic momentum , in comparison to the magnetic momentum of the electron , more sensitive to the non - perturbative hadronic effects and thus can the @xmath4 determination serve as a good test field of the theory of strong interactions .",
    "a high - precision experimental result is available , the anomaly @xmath4 was measured by the @xmath1 collaboration in the e821 experiment at bnl with unprecedent precision of 0.7 ppm @xcite .",
    "a high - precision theoretical prediction is available also , but only in the electromagnetic and electroweak sector the accuracy is satisfactory . in case of the hadronic contribution @xmath5 more precision is desirable , because this contribution is the dominant source of the total uncertainty of the theoretical prediction , which does not allow to conclude on possible physics beyond the sm .",
    "depending on the author and the analyzed data one can cite different numbers . if one takes the values from the summary publication @xcite @xmath6 and @xmath7 one observes @xmath8",
    ", @xmath9 .",
    "the hadronic part is dominated by the lowest order and this can be calculated using the formula@xmath10 where @xmath11/[x^{2}+(1-x)\\frac{s}{m_{\\mu}^{2}}]$ ] and @xmath12 .",
    "the most important contribution comes from the pion channel @xmath13 , which we study in this work .",
    "the data are used to evaluate the integral up to few gev , above a perturbative calculation is possible . in order to compare to other authors we chose three different limits for the upper integration limit ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) .",
    "the expression ( [ eq : a_mi_had_lo ] ) was up to now @xcite always evaluated only by the direct integration of the @xmath17 data ( with small exceptions , see @xcite ) .",
    "our motivation and our aim is to demonstrate , that the use of an appropriate model allows for a dramatic error reduction . the error reduction in this domain is of a crucial importance , since there is an effort to decrease even more the experimental error @xcite and so , if one wants to solve the @xmath1 puzzle , the theoretical precision will have to follow .",
    "we base our evaluation of @xmath18 on the unitary and analytic ( u&a ) model of the pion electromagnetic ( em ) form factor and relate the form factor to the cross section @xmath19 , so as to obtain @xmath20 . for a reliable prediction one needs to construct a model that incorporates all known properties of the pion em form factor .",
    "the form factor is charge - normalized @xmath21 and pqcd predicts its asymptotic behavior @xmath22 , where @xmath23 .",
    "it is known , that @xmath24 is an analytic function in the whole complex @xmath25 plane , besides the branch points and the cut on the positive real axis , the cut going from the lowest branch point @xmath26 up to @xmath27 .",
    "the pion form factor has also cut on the second , unphysical riemann sheet for @xmath28 and satisfies the unitarity condition @xmath29=\\left[a_{1}^{1}(t)\\right]^{*}f_{\\pi}(t)+\\sigma(t)$ ] , where @xmath30 is the _ p_-wave isovector transition amplitude for elastic @xmath31 scattering and @xmath32 approximates all higher contributions . for @xmath33 one",
    "has @xmath34 and arrives to the so - called elastic unitarity condition .",
    "the construction of the u&a model starts from the vector meson dominance ( vmd ) picture in which@xmath35 where @xmath36 is the vector meson - pion coupling constant , @xmath37 is the universal vector meson coupling constant and three resonances are taken into account .",
    "we proceed to a non - linear transformation @xmath38^{2}}\\ ] ] in order to build in the cut , the lowest branch point @xmath39 and an effective branch point @xmath40 , the latter meant to approximate all higher branch points .",
    "the model then becomes@xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43,\\ ] ] where @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the expression can be modified further ; it can be shown that depending on the relative positions of thresholds and masses one has @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the masses and @xmath40 are considered as free parameters of the model and so their relative positions are not fixed . however , in order to provide explicit formulas in the following text , we will here suppose @xmath48 , what is actually being confirmed by the result of the data fitting .",
    "the next step in the model construction is incorporation of the cut on the second riemann sheet .",
    "we use a succession of poles and zeros generated by a rational function to approximate this cut ( pad approximation ) .",
    "we do it by adding to the model a multiplicative term @xmath49 , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are free parameters from the interval @xmath52 ( corresponds to @xmath28 ) . the construction of the model is finally achieved by giving the vector mesons non - zero decay widths @xmath53 .",
    "the model gets form@xmath54=\\left(\\frac{1-w^{2}}{1-w_{n}^{2}}\\right)^{2}\\frac{\\left(w - w_{z}\\right)\\left(w_{n}-w_{p}\\right)}{\\left(w_{n}-w_{z}\\right)\\left(w - w_{p}\\right)}\\ ] ]    @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58.\\ ] ] the ratio of couplings @xmath59 is a free parameter of the model , the two remaining ratios , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , can be related to the first one by using the normalization condition @xmath21 and by considering the behavior of the imaginary part of the form factor at @xmath62 .",
    "the @xmath63 interference is taken into account when fitting the experimental data by a breit - wigner term , the fitting function is@xmath64+re^{i\\phi}\\frac{m_{\\omega}^{2}}{m_{\\omega}^{2}-t - im_{\\omega}\\gamma_{\\omega}},\\ ] ] where @xmath65 and the amplitude @xmath66 is considered as an additional free parameter .",
    "the fitting function thus has 11 free parameters in total ( @xmath67 three masses , three widths , ratio @xmath59 , @xmath68 , @xmath51 and @xmath66 ) and is used to fit 523 experimental points measured in experiments _ cleo _ , _ na7 _ , _ olya _ , _ cmd _ , _ cmd-2 _ , _ snd _ , _ kloe _ , in _ jinr _ dubna and in @xmath69 collaboration at jefferson lab @xcite .",

    "two approaches were used for the error evaluation .",
    "the first one was a `` monte carlo '' method based on a random number generator with the assumption of the gaussian distribution for the uncertainties of the published data points .",
    "for each point a new one was randomly generated using the gaussian probability density function with the mean identical to the original point and @xmath70 equal to the published error .",
    "doing this for each point , new `` random '' data set was obtained .",
    "this data set was then fitted and the values of the parameters of the model @xmath71 as well as the value of @xmath18 were extracted . repeating the whole procedure 4000 times , we reached statistics high enough to allow us for a reliable error calculation .",
    "the mean @xmath72 and the @xmath70 were calculated from the 4000 values and since the mean is not , in general , identical with the optimal - fit value @xmath73 we present asymmetric uncertainties @xmath74 , where @xmath75 and @xmath76 .    in the second approach",
    "the program minuit was used to establish the uncertainties of the model parameters .",
    "then , taking the numerical derivatives for @xmath77 , the uncertainty was propagated to @xmath18 using the covariance matrix . in this method",
    "the errors are symmetric .",
    "in addition to the integration of the model , we also performed a direct integration of the data points based on the trapezoidal rule , so as to cross - check our compatibility with other authors .",

    "the use of the u&a model dramatically reduces the error on @xmath18 .",
    "this is not an arbitrary feature of the model but originates from model - independent information which is additional to the data in the integration region and which can be taken into account when the model is used .",
    "the most important sources contributing to error reduction are    * expected smoothness of the @xmath24 at small scale @xmath94 : the model provides a function behaving smoothly at small @xmath94 . * experimental data outside the integration region :",
    "the fit is done not only to the data inside , but also to the data outside the integration region .",
    "* theoretical knowledge on @xmath24 : the model respects all known properties of the pion em form factor .",
    "especially the first point plays an important role .",
    "the new precise data tend to lie above older , less precise data and , in some regions , the vertical spread of the data is very important , at the limit of inconsistency .",
    "if the calculation of the integral is based directly on data , then less precise data shift the mean value of the integral and enlarge the uncertainty .",
    "when the model is used , the predicted behavior of @xmath24 as given by the result of the fit is mostly determined by precisely measured points and is only little influenced by data with important uncertainties .",
    "this leads to more appropriate mean value and smaller errors . in consequence ,",
    "one arrives to the mean value of @xmath18 which is higher then what is obtained by the direct data integration and to much reduced uncertainty .",
    "the shift in the mean value goes in the `` right '' direction and brings the theoretical value closer to the experimental one .",
    "the error estimates from the two used methods are not fully compatible , the first method gives smaller errors .",
    "this might be related to statistical fluctuations ( 1st method ) and to approximations - numerical derivatives and linearization ( 2nd method ) .    in this article we presented the calculation of @xmath18 based on the u&a model .",
    "this approach allows for important error reduction and we plan to use it also for evaluating the contributions of other channels to @xmath95 .",
