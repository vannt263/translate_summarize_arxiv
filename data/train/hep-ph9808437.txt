    "it was shown recently @xcite that the qcd dipole picture @xcite can successfully describe the hera data @xcite on proton structure function @xmath0 at small @xmath1 in a wide range of @xmath2 .",
    "this important observation , indicating that the bfkl dynamics @xcite may be relevant already in the kinematic region accessible at the existing machine , invites one to apply the same methods for description of other related processes .",
    "the problem is particularly interesting in view of the conflicting opinions about the subject @xcite .",
    "diffraction dissociation of the virtual photons , also measured recently at hera @xcite , presents a challenging example of such a process .",
    "indeed , if one takes the traditional point of view @xcite that both elastic and inelastic diffractive amplitudes at high energies are consequences of absorption of the incident particle waves , it follows that the total cross - section ( related to forward elastic amplitude by the optical theorem ) and the forward diffraction cross - section should be very closely related . in the present paper we explore this relation in the framework of the qcd dipole picture .",
    "there are several reasons for a particular interest in studying of the _ forward _ diffraction dissociation in the qcd dipole picture .",
    " first , as we show below , the theoretical calculation does not introduce new parameters as compared to those already known from the fit to the total cross - section measurements @xcite .",
    "some minor ambiguities which appear in the final result are related to the limits of the validity of the model itself and thus may serve as important clues for the extension of the whole picture .",
    " second , the relation between the total cross - section and diffraction dissociation being quadratic , their comparison provides a sensitive test of the model , in particular of the absolute normalization of the cross - sections , difficult to obtain by any other method . in view of the possibility that measurements of the forward diffraction dissociation may be soon available @xcite",
    ", our exercise can also be of some practical importance .    ",
    "third , the bfkl dynamics implies that the behaviour of the forward amplitudes can not be obtained by a simple extrapolation of the high - energy limit found at finite momentum transfer @xcite .",
    "it is thus interesting to investigate separately the point @xmath3 .",
    " fourth , forward diffraction dissociation is the process which dominates the shadowing of virtual photons in nuclei .",
    "it is therefore important to know it as well as possible if one wants to study the multiple scattering effects .",
    " finally , the calculation at @xmath3 is technically simpler than that in the general case of arbitrary momentum transfer .",
    "this permits to have a much better control of the underlying assumptions and of the restrictions implied by the limited validity of the qcd dipole picture .",
    "recently , using the qcd dipole picture , we have derived the formulae for nuclear shadowing of high - energy virtual photons @xcite . as noted above",
    ", this process is closely related to the diffractive phenomena .",
    "we shall explore this relation in the present paper .",
    "diffraction dissociation in the framework of the bfkl dynamics was already discussed extensively @xcite using the momentum representation of the amplitudes .",
    "our approach , based on the qcd dipole technique @xcite , is closer to that of @xcite where the impact parameter representation is used instead .    in the next section",
    "we explain the meaning of the two components of diffractive dissociation , as defined in @xcite .",
    "section 3 and 4 present the major result of this paper , i.e.   the calculation of the diffractive structure functions at @xmath3 .",
    "saddle point approximation is discussed in section 5 and numerical results in section 6 .",
    "our conclusions are listed in the last section .",
    "as was observed in @xcite ( _ cf . _ also @xcite ) , the cross - section for diffraction dissociation in the qcd dipole model can be written as a sum of the two components    _ ( i ) _ _ quasi - elastic component _ , arising from the elastic scattering of the @xmath4 pair emerging from the virtual photon .",
    "this component may be considered as a generalization of the vector dominance model @xcite : the sum over masses of vector mesons is replaced by integral over the masses of the @xmath4 pair . also the transitions between the states with different relative transverse momenta of @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( i.e.   of different masses of the system )",
    "are taken explicitly into account .",
    "of course , such an approximation can be reasonable only in the continuum part of the system , outside the prominent vector meson resonances .",
    "for the explicit calculations of the exclusive vector meson production , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the quasi - elastic component contributes mostly to diffractive excitation of the masses of the order of @xmath2 , more precisely in the region @xmath7 where , as usual , @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the mass of the diffractively produced system .    _",
    "( ii ) _ _ direct component _ , corresponding to the direct ( two gluon exchange ) interaction of the full dipole cascade developed from the primary fluctuation of the virtual photon .",
    "this component can be regarded as a realization of the so - called triple - pomeron coupling @xcite in the qcd dipole picture @xcite .",
    "it contributes mainly to the region of very large masses , @xmath10 .",
    "as is clear from its definition , the amplitude for the quasi - elastic scattering of a virtual photon on a dipole of the transverse diameter @xmath11 , leading to a final state consisting of quark and antiquark of the total mass @xmath9 and the relative transverse momentum @xmath12 , can be written as @xmath13 where @xmath14 are the light - cone photon wave functions @xcite , with @xmath15 being the quark - antiquark relative transverse distance and @xmath16 the light - cone momentum function of one of the quarks , @xmath17 is the forward dipole - dipole elastic amplitude in the qcd dipole picture with @xcite @xmath18 and @xmath19\\ , , \\label{4a}\\ ] ] @xmath20 being the strong coupling constant . following @xcite",
    "we take @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is a constant .    using the argument given in @xcite ,",
    "the cross - section for scattering on the nucleon target can be expressed in the form    @xmath23    where @xmath24 the two - dimensional vector @xmath25 points in the direction of @xmath26 ( described by the azimuthal angle @xmath27 ) and its length equals @xmath28 the factor @xmath29 in the first equality of ( [ 8 ] ) takes care of the sum over different spin configurations of the @xmath4 pair , @xmath30 results from the sum over colours , and @xmath31 takes care of the average number of dipoles in a nucleon @xcite .",
    "it is not difficult to verify that after integrating over @xmath32 , eq .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) gives the familiar formula for the integrated diffractive cross - section @xcite @xmath33    using the formulae for @xmath34 @xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the electromagnetic coupling constant and @xmath37 the charge of the quark of flavour f , one can integrate over the azimuthal angle in ( [ 7 ] ) .",
    "one obtains @xmath38 @xmath39 is obtained from @xmath40 by substitution@xmath41 .",
    "the integrals over @xmath42 can be found in @xcite and we finally obtain @xmath43 @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 is the hypergeometric function .    the next step is to introduce ( 15 ) , ( 16 ) into ( [ 8 ] ) and perform the integration over @xmath47 ( integration over @xmath48 gives @xmath49 because the integrand does not depend on @xmath27 ) . using the relation @xmath50 with @xmath51 , we finally obtain for the structure functions @xmath52 @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 @xmath56 is the sum of squares of the quark charges .",
    "the hypergeometric functions from ( 15 ) , ( 16 ) were transformed into those in ( 19 ) , ( 20 ) using the relation @xcite @xmath57 where @xmath58 for longitudinal and @xmath59 for the transverse component .",
    "cross - section for the direct component can be written as @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the cross - section for diffractive dissociation of the dipole of transverse diameter @xmath62 , scattering off the dipole of transverse diameter @xmath11 , with @xmath63 .",
    "the formula for @xmath64 at @xmath3 can be derived using the mueller ",
    "patel formulation @xcite .",
    "we have @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the single dipole density in the dipole of the transverse diameter @xmath11 given by @xmath67 @xmath68 is the forward scattering amplitude for collision of two dipoles of transverse diameters @xmath69 and @xmath69 ( given in @xcite ) , and @xmath70 is the two - dipole density in an dipole of transverse diameter @xmath62 .",
    "the equation for @xmath71 was written down in @xcite .",
    "it reads @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the ultraviolet cut - off defined in @xcite ( the final result does not depend on @xmath73 ) .",
    "( [ in3 ] ) shows clearly the physical meaning of @xmath71 : the first term describes emission of a single gluon at rapidity @xmath74 followed by independent evolution of two dipoles ( formed from the produced gluon and the original @xmath4 pair ) , each producing @xmath75 new dipoles ; the second term describes the evolution of the original dipole from rapidity @xmath76 until @xmath74 .",
    "it is important to realize that the eq .",
    "( [ in3 ] ) can be trusted only if @xmath74 is not too close to @xmath76 .",
    "indeed , the basic assumption of the bfkl approximation is that the longitudinal momenta of emitted gluons are _ strongly ordered _",
    ", i.e.   the momentum of each emitted gluon is much smaller than that of the previous one . in the case",
    "we consider , the point @xmath77 corresponds to the first emitted gluon taking _ all _ momentum of the initial quarks .",
    "this is of course in blatant contradiction to the very idea of the bfkl physics .",
    "the problem can be cured by introducing an appropriate cut - off which would eliminate such unphysical configurations .",
    "unfortunately , there is no unique way to do it and thus the result is ambiguous . in order to obtain an idea about the scale of this uncertainty",
    ", we have considered a modified equation for @xmath71 in which we replaced the function @xmath78 in the first term on the rhs of ( [ in3 ] ) by a function @xmath79 representing the required cut - off in longitudinal momentum of the emitted gluon .",
    "we have then studied the results varying the cut - off .",
    "they are described in section 6 .",
    "following closely the method shown in @xcite , eq .",
    "( [ in3 ] ) can be solved with the result @xmath80 where @xmath81 for @xmath82 ( as in ( [ in3 ] ) ) , @xmath83 reduces trivially to @xmath78 .",
    "when ( [ in4 ] ) is introduced into ( [ in1 ] ) the integrals can be explicitly performed and the final result is @xcite @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "averaging over the photon wave functions can also be explicitly performed and one finally obtains @xmath87 where @xmath88 is given by ( [ 4.2 ] ) with the substitution @xmath89 with @xmath90 the indices @xmath91 refer to the transverse and longitudinal photons , respectively .    using the relation ( [ 8 t ] )",
    "we can thus write for the diffractive structure function @xmath92",
    "before discussing the numerical results , it is interesting to consider the saddle - point approximation which gives the limiting behaviour of structure functions when @xmath93 .    for @xmath94",
    "the calculation is straightforward , we simply evaluate independently the two integrals .",
    "the position of the saddle point ( identical for @xmath95 and for @xmath96 ) is @xmath97 where @xmath98 so that we obtain @xmath99 we see from ( [ ii ] ) that @xmath100 shows a typical bfkl power - law behaviour in @xmath101 ( modified by logarithmic corrections , similarly as in case of @xmath102 @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath103 dependence is also dominated by the power - law modified by a hypergeometric function .",
    "the scaling is violated by the last factor which decreases with increasing @xmath2 and mixes in a complicated way the @xmath104 and the energy dependence .    in the case of @xmath105",
    "the simple procedure used above fails because the integrand has a pole at @xmath106 and thus the contour of integration can be moved to the position of saddle point only after the contribution from the pole is added . to obtain this contribution we first move the contour in @xmath96 complex plane to the right of the point @xmath107 . the contribution from the pole",
    "is then easily found to be @xmath108 the integral over @xmath109 can now be evaluated by the saddle - point method and we obtain @xmath110 one should add to this the integral to the right of the pole .",
    "this integral can be estimated by the saddle point method because now the contours are to the right of 1 ( in both complex planes ) .",
    "the resulting contribution is @xmath111 the interesting feature is that while the pole contribution scales exactly , the remaining integral increases with @xmath2 ( it decreases in absolute value but has a negative sign ) .",
    "consequently , @xmath105 increases with increasing @xmath2 . otherwise the behaviour is qualitatively similar to that of @xmath94 except for the `` kinematical '' factor @xmath112 ( implying that the transverse component dominates over the longitudinal one everywhere except in the vicinity of @xmath113 ) .    for @xmath114",
    "we thus obtain a fairly complicated @xmath2 dependence reflecting @xmath103-dependent mixing of the transverse and longitudinal contributions .",
    "direct component can be approximated by first performing the saddle point in @xmath115 and then in @xmath116 .",
    "we only give here results without the cut - off , i.e.   for @xmath117 .",
    "after first integration ( @xmath118 ) we obtain @xmath119 the integral over @xmath116 is somewhat more complicated .",
    "the saddle point equation is @xmath120 this can be solved in two steps .",
    "first we find @xmath121 from the equation @xmath122 then we write @xmath123 .",
    "@xmath124 can be found from ( [ av ] ) : @xmath125 where @xmath126 @xmath127 in the limit @xmath128 , so that the approximation is correct .",
    "when this is introduced into ( [ v ] ) we obtain @xmath129 unfortunately , this requires solution of the eq .",
    "( [ bv ] ) and thus numerical work .    the major new effect seen from ( [ dv ] )",
    "is that here the @xmath101 and @xmath103 dependence are no longer determined by the bfkl pomeron intercept . instead ,",
    "the relevant powers depend on @xmath121 which , in turn , is a function of the ratio @xmath130 . thus a rather complicated structure appears . in figure 1 @xmath131 and @xmath132 which determine the powers in @xmath101 and @xmath103 dependence are shown .",
    "one sees that they are always larger than @xmath133 .",
    "another interesting observation is that the dominant factor in @xmath134 dependence is @xmath135 instead of @xmath134 found in @xmath102 @xcite .",
    "one sees in fig .",
    "1 that @xmath136 is substantially smaller than one and thus the effect is significant .    7.5 cm",
    "we have performed numerical estimates of the results presented in previous sections using the parameters given in @xcite .    in figure 2 the @xmath103 dependence of longitudinal and transverse photon contributions to the quasi - elastic component of the structure function",
    "one sees that the quasi - elastic transverse contribution largely dominates the longitudinal one , except at @xmath137 where the longitudinal one fills the dip .",
    "8.3 cm    such a large value of the quasi - elastic transverse component can be traced to the presence of the pole at @xmath106 in the integrand of ( [ 8x ] ) which gives the main contribution to the integral .",
    "this pole , in turn , arises from integration over the regions of @xmath16 close to zero and one , where the cut - off on the transverse size of the photon ( as expressed by the mc donald function in ( 10 ) , ( 11 ) ) is ineffective .",
    "we thus see that an important contribution to the transverse quasi - elastic component comes from the non - perturbative region of large transverse sizes of the photon . ] . to investigate this problem in more detail ,",
    "we have calculated the structure functions under the condition that the cutoff in photon size should never be larger than a certain parameter r , i.e.   @xmath138 the resulting formulae are identical to eqs .",

    "one sees that @xmath142 is reduced by a factor of about 2 , in comparison with the uncut result , whereas the longitudinal component is hardly affected .",
    "we thus conclude that the qcd dipole picture does not provide a reliable prediction for @xmath142 : it must be supplemented by an additional non - perturbative input . inverting this argument",
    ", one may say that measurements of this component can give interesting information on non - perturbative structure in the small @xmath1 region .",
    "the @xmath134-dependence of the quasi - elastic component is shown in figs .",
    "3a and 3b .",
    "one sees that indeed , as was seen qualitatively from the saddle - point approximation , the longitudinal component decreases whereas the transverse one increases with increasing @xmath134 . in result @xmath143",
    "decreases at @xmath144 , is almost constant at @xmath145 , and increases at smaller @xmath103 .",
    "the comparison between figures 4a and 4b shows that this qualitative behaviour is unaffected by the cut ( [ 41 ] ) , although the precise rate of change of course depends on it .",
    "we have also calculated the @xmath101 dependence .",
    "it shows a simple power law behaviour , consistent with the expectations from the saddle - point formulae of section 5 .",
    "8.5 cm    the @xmath103-dependence of the 3-pomeron component is plotted in figure 4 in the log - log scale .",
    "as described in section 4 , we have investigated the dependence of the results on the cutoff in the rapidity of the emitted gluons .",
    "the cutoff function was taken in the form @xmath146 where @xmath147 is a constant .",
    "the results in fig.4 are shown for @xmath148 ( no cut ) , @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "one sees that the uncut distribution follows very closely a power law , @xmath151 , in the full region of @xmath103 .",
    "this power is significantly larger than @xmath133 , as expected from the discussion in section 5 .",
    "the effects of the cutoff ( [ 6n ] ) is twofold .",
    "first , as expected , it reduces strongly the structure function at large @xmath103 ( at @xmath152 the structure function vanishes ) and thus changes its shape .",
    "the structure function is affected , however , also in the region of small @xmath103 , @xmath153 , where it is simply multiplied by a constant ( smaller than one ) .",
    "we thus see that without a better understanding of the energy - momentum conservation constraints in gluon emission ( which are responsible for the cutoff in the gluon rapidity spectrum ) there is little hope to obtain accurate predictions for the 3-pomeron component of the structure function , even in the region of small @xmath103 .",
    "recently , andersson @xcite suggested that the energy - momentum conservation constraints in gluon emission can be taken into account by simply cutting out @xmath154 from the edge of the available phase - space in rapidity .",
    "the result of this prescription ( which amounts to take @xmath155 and thus simply changes @xmath103 into @xmath156 ) is also shown in fig.4 .",
    "one sees that the value of the 3-pomeron component in the small @xmath103 region is reduced by a factor of about @xmath29 .",
    "using the qcd dipole picture , we have derived the formulae for the forward cross - section of diffraction dissociation of a virtual photon on a dipole of transverse size @xmath11 . using the hypothesis formulated in @xcite ( i.e.   assuming that the nucleon is a collection of a number ( @xmath157 ) of qcd dipoles ) we estimated the relevant cross - sections on the nucleon target .",
    "our conclusions can be formulated as follows .",
    "\\(b ) fairly precise predictions can be made for the longitudinal quasi - elastic contribution .",
    "the results for other components are somewhat ambiguous .",
    "the transverse quasi - elastic component is sensitive to the non - perturbative region of large transverse sizes in the photon wave function ( corresponding to the `` aligned jets '' of ref.@xcite ) and therefore depends on additional non - perturbative parameters .",
    "its measurements may thus provide an interesting information on non - perturbative physics at small @xmath1 .",
    "there is thus a strong interest in separate measurements of longitudinal and transverse components of the diffractive structure functions .",
    "the 3-pomeron component is sensitive to the probability of gluon emission at large rapidity and thus to the effects of energy - momentum conservation which are neglected in the qcd dipole model ( and in the whole bfkl approach ) .",
    "\\(c ) within the ambiguities listed above , the obtained structure functions turn out to be of the same order as those obtained from a simple extrapolation of the existing data @xcite to @xmath3",
    ". the detailed comparison with the future precise data shall thus be very illuminating .",
    "\\(d ) the obtained effective pomeron intercept ( including logarithmic corrections ) turns out to be close to that measured in @xmath0 , i.e. , in the total @xmath158 cross - section ( and even somewhat larger in the 3-pomeron region ) .",
    "thus we predict a substantially stronger @xmath101 dependence of diffractive structure functions at @xmath3 than that observed till now at larger @xmath159 @xcite .",
    "\\(e ) our calculation predicts a rich structure of the scaling violation .",
    "longitudinal quasielastic component is expected to decrease with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "the transverse one increases to a limiting value at large @xmath2 .",
    "the 3-pomeron contribution increases , following approximately a power law in @xmath2 .",
    "to summarize , the qcd dipole picture predicts some interesting physics to be found in the diffractive structure functions at @xmath3 .",
    "it remains to be seen if this shall indeed show up in the future measurements .      _",
    "( i ) _ the _ forward _ elastic dipole - dipole amplitude given by ( [ 3 ] ) is the integral of the amplitude _ at a fixed impact parameter _ :",
    "@xmath160 the numerical mc estimates reported in @xcite indicate that @xmath161 violates unitarity at small impact parameters .",
    "this was shown in @xcite not to be essential for the value of the integrated amplitude @xmath162 given in ( [ 51 ] ) , at least at the presently available energies .",
    "therefore we expect that also in our case the possible violation of unitarity should not invalidate the obtained estimates .",
    "_ ( ii ) _ it was shown in @xcite that the diffractive cross - section calculated at fixed @xmath159 in the 3-pomeron region , when extrapolated to @xmath3 , reveals a singularity of the form @xmath163 .",

    "\\label{52}\\ ] ]    _ ( iii ) _ the leading logarithmic approximation which is at the origin of the bfkl approach ( and thus also of the qcd dipole picture ) does not allow to fix uniquely the energy scale",
    ". therefore relation of the variables @xmath1 and @xmath101 to @xmath76 and @xmath74 is somewhat arbitrary .",
    "this is particularly controversial in the case of the quasi - elastic component , where the dipole picture suggests @xmath76 as the relevant variable , whereas the experience from regge phenomenology suggests @xmath74 instead @xcite .",
    "we have taken @xmath76 to be fully consistent in our derivation of eq .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) ( if @xmath74 is taken , ( [ 88 ] ) is inconsistent with ( [ 8 ] ) ) .    _",
    "( iv ) _ it was suggested in @xcite that rapidity variable @xmath76 can be affected by the value of the light - cone momentum fraction @xmath16 in the photon wave function , e.g. , @xmath165 in the present paper we have taken the conservative approach and neglected this possibility .",
    "it is interesting to note , however , that this effect would strongly reduce the contribution from the regions @xmath166 and @xmath167 .",
    "consequently , the sensitivity of the calculations to the non - perturbative contributions would be substantially reduced .",
