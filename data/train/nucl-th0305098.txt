    "the role of final state interaction ( fsi ) in incoherent photoproduction of @xmath0-mesons on the deuteron was investigated in our previous work @xcite .",
    "first we have considered in @xcite the first - order approximation ( foa ) where complete hadronic rescattering is included in the two - body subsystems ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) only , and in the subsequent work @xcite the three - body aspects of the reaction were studied . summarizing the results we would like to conclude that the importance of final state interaction arises from two sources which are interrelated .",
    "firstly , the impulse approximation ( ia ) , where the fsi is ignored , predicts a very strong suppression of the cross section close to the threshold .",
    "the reason for this is a strong mismatch between the large nucleon momentum needed for @xmath0 meson production ( more than 200 mev / c ) and the average available momentum in the deuteron of about 45 mev / c .",
    "the fsi provides an efficient mechanism to compensate this momentum mismatch by the collision between the final particles . as a consequence ,",
    "already the leading terms in the multiple scattering series associated with pairwise @xmath1 and @xmath2 scattering produce a very large enhancement of the @xmath0 production rate close to the threshold .",
    "this conclusion has later been confirmed by sibirtsev et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the second reason is a relatively strong @xmath2 interaction at low - energy .",
    "because of its amplification via the @xmath1 interaction an appreciable attraction in the @xmath3 system is generated , which in turn leads to a virtual pole in the @xmath4-wave part of the three - body scattering amplitude @xcite . in the case of the spin - singlet @xmath3 state @xmath5 , which dominates the reaction close to the threshold , the pole lies on the three - body unphysical sheet not far from zero kinetic energy @xcite .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the existence of a virtual state near zero energy is the reason , why the foa can not provide an accurate description of the reaction dynamics at low energy .",
    "this statement is corroborated by the fact , that the multiple scattering series converges slowly near the pole so that the foa does not constitute a reliable approximation to the whole series .",
    "in particular , the foa is unable to account for anomalies in the energy dependence of the total cross section , since singularities of the three - body scattering amplitude can not be generated in a perturbative approach ( see , e.g. , the general arguments given in @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , as was shown in @xcite , only the full three - body treatment can explain , at least qualitatively , the anomalously strong rise of the experimental @xmath6 cross section just above threshold .",
    "however , our work in @xcite was only considered as a first step for taking into account the most important dynamical properties of the @xmath3 system , because of several simplifications for the two - body forces .",
    "this concerns primarily the @xmath1-sector , especially the deuteron wave function , which in @xcite was taken as a pure @xmath7 state , generated by the yamaguchi potential @xcite .",
    "clearly , such a treatment is too simple for @xmath0 photoproduction where large momentum transfers come into play .",
    "thus the first motivation for the present paper is to overcome this shortcoming by using a realistic @xmath1-potential . in sect .",
    "[ sect2 ] , we give the details of the two - body interactions and present the results for the total and differential cross sections . for the comparison with the inclusive data of @xcite also the coherent reaction @xmath8 is calculated . as will be shown",
    ", our predictions slightly underestimate the data in almost the whole energy region from threshold up to @xmath9 mev .",
    "we will discuss possible reasons for this disagreement .",
    "the second motivation of the paper is to compare our results with the work of sibirtsev et al",
    ".  @xcite . in sect .",
    "[ sect3 ] we point out principal disagreements between the results of @xcite and ours , which can not be explained by the differences of the model ingredients . finally , in sect .  [ sect4 ]",
    "we analyze the possibility of extracting the strength of the @xmath2 interaction in incoherent @xmath0 photoproduction on the deuteron .",
    "the transition matrix element of the reaction @xmath10 has been evaluated with inclusion of the hadronic interactions between the final particles whereas the initial electromagnetic interaction is treated perturbatively in lowest order .",
    "the general formalism of our approach is described in detail in @xcite . here",
    "we present mainly the most important two - body ingredients of the calculation .    as a basic input we need the @xmath2 and @xmath1 scattering amplitudes which were restricted to @xmath4-states only in view of the near threshold region . for the @xmath2 interaction we use a conventional isobar ansatz as described in detail in @xcite , where the @xmath2 channel is coupled with @xmath11 and @xmath12 channels through the excitation of the @xmath13 resonance .",
    "the separable @xmath2 scattering matrix has the usual isobar form @xmath14 as a function of the invariant energy @xmath15 .",
    "the @xmath13 self energies @xmath16 and @xmath17 are determined by the vertex functions @xmath18 as @xmath19 ^ 2 } { w - e_n(q)-\\omega_\\alpha(q)+i\\epsilon}\\ , , \\",
    "\\quad \\alpha\\in\\{\\pi,\\eta\\}\\,,\\ ] ] with @xmath20 and @xmath21 , ( @xmath22 ) denoting the on - shell energies of nucleon and meson , respectively .",
    "the two - pion channel is included in a simplified manner by adding the @xmath23 decay width , parametrized by @xmath24 the vertex functions are taken in a hulthn form @xmath25^{-1}\\,,\\ ] ] containing the strength of the coupling @xmath26 and the range of the hulthn form factor @xmath27 .",
    "the parameters ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) were adjusted to fit the @xmath2 scattering length @xmath28 and at the same time to provide a reasonably good description of the reactions @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( for more details see @xcite ) .",
    "we consider this value as an approximate average of the scattering lengths provided by modern @xmath2 scattering analyses ( see , e.g. , the compilation in tablei of @xcite ) . in sect .",
    "[ sect4 ] , where we study the dependence of the results on the @xmath2 interaction strength , two other sets of @xmath2 parameters are used .",
    "the first one , giving @xmath31 fm is taken from @xcite .",
    "the second set is adjusted such , that the scattering length @xmath32 fm of the analysis @xcite is reproduced .",
    "the corresponding parameters are listed in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the latter value is obtained simply by varying the parameters of our separable ansatz ( [ eq10 ] ) without using the original model of @xcite .",
    "one of the consequences of this strategy is that the born term introduced in @xcite is absorbed in our approach by the resonance amplitude , which leads to an overestimation of the @xmath33 contribution . in this case",
    "we achieve a satisfactory description of the @xmath30 experimental cross section , and the resulting @xmath2 amplitude agrees rather well with the ones of @xcite .",
    "however , unlike the first two sets , we can not reproduce the @xmath33 wave of the @xmath29 analysis @xcite , also below the @xmath2 threshold , unless a relatively large contribution of the @xmath34 resonance is included .",
    "the electromagnetic vertex of the amplitude @xmath35 for the elementary process @xmath36 was fixed by fitting the corresponding data of @xcite . below the @xmath2 threshold",
    ", we have required that the pion production amplitude @xmath37 , taken from @xcite , is reasonably well described as presented in @xcite . for the neutron amplitude we have used the relation @xmath38 which is consistent with the experimental value @xmath39 = 0.67 @xmath40 extracted from @xmath0 photoproduction on very light nuclei @xcite .    with respect to the @xmath1-interaction ,",
    "only the most important @xmath41 state is taken into account , since , as was shown in @xcite , the contribution of the triplet state is insignificant , primarily due to the isovector nature of the electromagnetic excitation @xmath42 . for the @xmath41 state we have used the separable representation best3 @xcite for the bonn potential .",
    "the deuteron bound state wave function was calculated using the corresponding best4 version for the @xmath43 states .",
    "the three - body integral equations were solved only for the lowest @xmath4-wave three - body configuration where the orbital angular momentum @xmath44 in the two - body subsystems is coupled with angular momentum @xmath44 of the third particle with respect to the pair . the remaining partial waves were treated perturbatively up to the first order in the @xmath4-wave @xmath45-matrices of @xmath1 and @xmath2 scattering .",
    "this approximation is well justified by the strong @xmath4-wave dominance in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 low energy interactions . as was shown in @xcite , it is the lowest @xmath4-wave three - body state , that is very sensitive to the higher - order scattering contributions , whereas the higher partial waves are well approximated by the first order terms . as already indicated above , perturbative calculation , where only pairwise @xmath1 and @xmath2 fsi s are taken into account in all partial waves is referred to as first - order approximation ( foa ) .    the significance of fsi is demonstrated in fig.[fig1 ] for the total cross section and in fig.[fig2 ] for the @xmath0 angular distribution . in order to appreciate the importance of a realistic treatment of the @xmath1 sector , the results",
    "should be compared with those presented in figs.8 and 9 of @xcite , obtained by means of the yamaguchi potential and using a pure @xmath4-wave deuteron .",
    "as expected , for a realistic @xmath1-interaction the fsi effect becomes smaller .",
    "the obvious reason is the @xmath1-repulsive core which weakens the attraction in the final @xmath3 system at small relative distances . at the same time",
    "the `` three - body '' effect remains important .",
    "for instance , at @xmath46 mev the three - body treatment enhances the first - order result by about a factor two .",
    "also the steep rise right above threshold is a characteristic feature of the three - body approach which is not born out in foa .    in order to compare our results with the inclusive measurement @xcite we calculated in addition to the break - up channel the coherent cross section @xmath8 . in analogy with the incoherent process",
    ", the calculation was performed within the quasiparticle formalism of the three - body problem , as described in @xcite . in this case",
    "we neglect the small contribution of the deuteron @xmath47-state , which contributes only 1@xmath48 in the ia cross section .",
    "since the coherent cross section is proportional to the modulus of the isoscalar part @xmath49 of the @xmath42 transition amplitude , we have fixed it according to the relation @xmath50 as found in @xcite .",
    "this value is also close to @xmath51 of @xcite .",
    "the corresponding total cross section and one angular distribution are plotted in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "as one notices , the effect of fsi is also very pronounced .",
    "it is not , however , as large as obtained in @xcite , where we have used a more attractive @xmath2 interaction with @xmath32 fm .",
    "adding the coherent contribution we obtain the inclusive cross section shown in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] by solid curves .",
    "we notice that although the three - body calculation leads to a sizable improvement of the theoretical prediction just above threshold , a quantitative agreement with the experimental results has not been reached yet , the theory being too low .",
    "moreover , above @xmath52 mev the inclusion of higher - order terms in the lowest partial wave acts in the opposite direction by decreasing the cross section of the foa . in this region",
    "the three - body model exhibits an even larger deviation from the data than the foa .",
    "the slight disagreement with the experimental results points apparently to the fact , that the mechanism of the @xmath0 photoproduction is more complicated and some of its important details are not properly accounted for by our calculation . in this connection",
    ", we would like to make a few comments concerning possible ways of improving the theoretical treatment .",
    "the first relates to the off - shell behavior of the @xmath2 scattering matrix , which may be much more complex as given by the vertices @xmath53 in ( [ eq40 ] ) . in particular ,",
    "it was already noted in @xcite that the simple hulthn form factors may strongly overestimate the short - range @xmath3 interaction , since the resulting separable @xmath2 potential is probably too attractive near the origin .",
    "this is hardly important for low - energy @xmath54 scattering but it is relevant for @xmath0 photoproduction which in general is quite sensitive to the @xmath2 wave function at small distances .",
    "clearly , a more realistic description of this short - range behavior would require a much more thorough treatment of the @xmath2 interaction , where the resonance excitation is considered microscopically with respect to the internal dynamics of hadrons .",
    "another comment is related to the explicit coupling to @xmath55 states .",
    "it was neglected in the present calculation ( except for virtual @xmath11 decays in the @xmath33 propagator ) , since a correct inclusion of a pion would require substantial refinements of our three - body treatment , in particular the insertion of a variety of resonances which are excited in @xmath11-collisions .",
    "if the @xmath55 states are properly taken into account , then among other factors the @xmath0 photoproduction can proceed according to the two - step scheme @xmath56 , where a pion , being produced by the photon , is subsequently rescattered into an @xmath0 by the other nucleon . according to the results of @xcite , the contribution of the intermediate pion depends strongly on the role of large momentum transfers in the reaction mechanism .",
    "for example , whereas @xmath55 states provide only a small fraction of the @xmath54 scattering cross section @xcite , they contribute rather sizeably to coherent @xmath0 photoproduction on the deuteron @xcite .",
    "it was shown in @xcite , where only the @xmath13 resonance was included into the @xmath57 amplitude , that the @xmath10 cross section is insignificantly affected if the pion rescattering mechanism is considered .",
    "however , it may well be that inclusion of other resonances into the pion photoproduction amplitude can improve the agreement between our calculation and the data @xcite .",
    "finally , it must be noted that the relation ( [ neut ] ) , fixing the neutron amplitude , is only the simplest variant matching the required relation between the elementary cross sections .",
    "namely , as was pointed out in @xcite , it does not account for a possible relative phase between @xmath35 and @xmath58 .",
    "this phase is predicted , e.g. , if the corresponding electromagnetic vertices are extracted by fitting different isotopic channels of pion photoproduction @xcite . most likely , this fact is insignificant in the region of large photon energies , where the amplitudes @xmath35 and @xmath58 are added incoherently because of large relative momenta between the particles . at the same time , near threshold",
    "the interference between @xmath35 and @xmath58 increases due to a reduction of the available phase space , which requires a more sophisticated treatment of the isotopic structure of the elementary photoproduction operator .",
    "now we turn to the comparison of our results to those obtained by sibirtsev et al . in a series of papers @xcite where the fsi effects were studied within the first - order approximation .",
    "first of all , they confirmed our previous conclusion @xcite with respect to the fundamental role of the final state interaction in the near threshold region .",
    "but moreover , they have claimed that already the incoherent reaction in foa for the final state without inclusion of the coherent channel provides a good description of the experimental cross section for @xmath59 @xcite with a reasonable value for the @xmath2 scattering length .",
    "this result is at variance with our own conclusion about the necessity of a three - body treatment of the final @xmath3 state , and the nonnegligible contribution of the coherent reaction .",
    "these contradicting conclusions seem to be especially surprising in view of the fact that the models used in @xcite and in @xcite differ only in nonessential details , such as , e.g. , relativistic vs.  nonrelativistic parametrizations of the @xmath0 production amplitude .",
    "therefore , we would like to point out the principal discrepancies between our results and those of @xcite which we were unable to trace back to model differences of the two calculations .",
    "to this end , we show in fig.[fig4 ] our first - order calculation of the total cross section , which reproduces our previous results obtained in @xcite .",
    "small deviations are due to different parametrization of the elementary production operator and the @xmath2 scattering amplitude . in the left panel of fig.[fig5 ]",
    "we compare our impulse approximation ( ia ) with the corresponding results of fig.1 in @xcite and those presented in @xcite .",
    "the right panel shows the ratio of the ia of @xcite to our ia .",
    "one readily notices that our calculation is in reasonable agreement with that of @xcite and the difference of our result to the one of @xcite indicates the model dependence to be expected from different parametrization of the elementary photoproduction amplitude and the deuteron wave function . but both ias are far below the prediction of @xcite .",
    "for example , at the energy @xmath46 mev the latter cross section is by about a factor 3.6 larger than ours ( see right panel in fig.[fig5 ] ) .",
    "this disagreement is especially surprising since the ia is quite insensitive to the model ingredients .",
    "namely , if one uses a realistic deuteron wave function in conjunction with an elementary production operator fitted to the single nucleon data , than the @xmath10 cross section is fixed almost unambiguously . a little freedom associated with the choice of the invariant energy @xmath60 of the active @xmath61 subsystem",
    "does not play a role at all , since in the present calculation and in @xcite this energy is taken according to the same prescription ( compare the formulas ( 33 ) of @xcite and ( 2 ) of @xcite ) .",
    "in other words , a model dependence can not explain such a strong difference between the ia results .",
    "turning now to the role of fsi we also find quite different effects .",
    "namely in @xcite the fsi effect decreases rapidly above the threshold and vanishes completely at @xmath62 = 680 mev , so that above this point the total cross section is determined exclusively by the ia , whereas according to our findings the fsi contribution does not exactly vanish at all energies examined here . in more detail , the enhancement of the cross section due to the @xmath1 interaction is reduced asymptotically to about 1.5 @xmath48 at @xmath63 mev ( see fig.[fig4 ] ) . for the @xmath2 interaction",
    "we obtain an enhancement of about 20@xmath48 at @xmath46 mev .",
    "this effect is visibly smaller than the 45 @xmath48 given in fig.6 of @xcite for the same energy @xcite .",
    "this disagreement can not be traced back to the strength of the @xmath2 interaction because the @xmath2 scattering length @xmath64 fm used in @xcite is even slightly smaller than our value given in ( [ eq50 ] ) . with increasing energy the influence of the @xmath2 fsi changes sign and results , according to our calculation , in a slight reduction of about 4 @xmath48 of the cross section in the resonance peak ( see right panel of fig.[fig4 ] ) .",
    "the latter effect must originate from a relatively strong absorption of @xmath0-mesons through the rescattering into pions , which is expected to be most pronounced in the resonance region .",
    "the same smearing of the resonance peak due to the strong inelasticity of the @xmath2 interaction is observed also in heavier nuclei @xcite where it manifests itself naturally much stronger .",
    "this energy dependence of the @xmath2 fsi is not supported by the results presented in @xcite where rescattering effects do not play any role above @xmath65 mev .",
    "we would like to note that this discrepancy must be explained before any conclusion about the understanding of @xmath0 photoproduction on the deuteron is drawn .",
    "in this last section we address the question to what extent the @xmath2 interaction can be `` extracted '' from incoherent @xmath0 photoproduction on the deuteron . the idea to obtain the information on the @xmath2 low - energy scattering parameters from this reaction was explored in @xcite .",
    "in particular , it was found that the cross section is quite sensitive to the @xmath2 interaction strength , making it possible to study @xmath2 scattering by analyzing the observed single particle spectra or angular distributions .    in our opinion , such a method very likely will meet serious difficulties , and we support our scepticism by several numerical results presented below .",
    "firstly , and this is the crucial point for the following conclusions , we do not observe any strong sensitivity of the cross section to the @xmath2 interaction strength as is claimed in @xcite .",
    "the effect on the @xmath0 angular distribution of varying the @xmath2 parameters is demonstrated in the left panel of fig.[fig6 ] .",
    "the calculations are performed within the three - body approach as outlined above . in each case",
    "the e.m .",
    "vertex was adjusted to reproduce the elementary experimental cross section . comparing the present result with fig.4 of",
    "@xcite one sees that in our case the dependence on the @xmath2 scattering length is much less pronounced .",
    "thus , we have to conclude that the experimental discrimination between different @xmath2 models would require extremely precise measurements .",
    "furthermore , such a weak sensitivity makes the extraction of the @xmath2 scattering parameters very model dependent .",
    "the reason has to do with the off - shell behavior of the @xmath66 amplitude .",
    "this is especially critical for the region below the free @xmath2 threshold which comes into play , when contributions beyond the ia are considered .",
    "for example , the results presented above are obtained within the so - called `` spectator on - shell '' choice for the invariant energy @xmath60 of the @xmath61 system , which is natural for the nonrelativistic three - body theory . in this case , as one integrates over the spectator nucleon momentum in the deuteron , @xmath60 covers the range @xmath67 $ ] where @xmath15 is the invariant energy of the @xmath3 system .",
    "although the uncertainty of the @xmath66 subthreshold behavior is not very crucial for the incoherent reaction , it makes the method of precise determination of @xmath2 parameters much more ambiguous , than was presented in @xcite .",
    "this difficulty is quite general when one tries to determine the contribution of an individual diagram to the whole amplitude .    in this connection",
    "we would like to recall the migdal - watson theory @xcite which makes it possible to study the two - body interaction without regard to the particular way of embedding this interaction into the reaction amplitude .",
    "according to this theory the low - energy parameters of two - body scattering can in principle be identified by fitting the energy spectrum of the third particle close to the maximum energy value . in order to illustrate the practical applicability of this method to the @xmath2 interaction , we show in the right panel of fig.[fig6 ] the proton spectrum at a fixed angle @xmath68 .",
    "the curves were obtained within the three - body approach using the same three different parametrizations of the @xmath2 sector as in the left panel .",
    "only the upper end of the spectrum , corresponding to low relative @xmath69 energies , is shown , since only this part is relevant . according to the migdal - watson theory",
    "the behavior of the proton energy distribution in this region reflects the energy dependence of the elementary @xmath69 cross section , disregarding the terms which depend weakly on the @xmath69 relative energy . to eliminate the effect of the kinematical boundary , the spectrum is divided by @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the maximum proton energy . as one notes , also in this case",
    "the experimental discrimination between the @xmath2 models seems to meet the same difficulties .",
    "namely , the form of the spectrum is not strongly affected by the @xmath2 interaction .",
    "the reason is that the form of the @xmath2 elastic scattering cross section , shown in the insert in the right panel , does not sizeably vary with the value of @xmath72 .",
    "the role of final state interaction in incoherent @xmath0 photoproduction on a deuteron has been investigated using a three - body model for treating the interaction in the final @xmath3 system .",
    "in contrast to our previous work @xcite the present results were obtained by using a realistic @xmath1 interaction based on the separable representation of the bonn potential . as a summary",
    ", we would like to draw the following conclusions :    \\(i ) as may be expected , a realistic treatment of the @xmath1 sector reduces the fsi effect compared to the use of a simple yamaguchi potential . at the same time , the influence of higher - order rescattering in the final state remains essential and must be taken into account close to the threshold .",
    "\\(ii ) our three - body calculation underestimate the data @xcite slightly in the energy region up to @xmath73 780 mev .",
    "one open point , which remains to be investigated in this connection , is the short - range part of the @xmath3 wave function .",
    "the latter can be quite sensitive , e.g. , to the contribution of the @xmath55 configuration which was omitted here .",
    "\\(iii ) there exists a principal discrepancy between our results and the ones of sibirtsev et al .",
    "most disturbing is the fact that already the simple impulse approximation of @xcite where the model ambiguities should be small , exhibits a strong disagreement with other authors @xcite . in this connection",
    "we would like to emphasize , that the statement , that the reaction @xmath10 is well understood within existing theoretical approaches is premature , even if a seemingly good description of the data in @xcite is achieved . further theoretical work is certainly needed .",
    "\\(iv ) we do not find a strong sensitivity of the @xmath10 cross section to the @xmath2 interaction strength as was claimed in @xcite .",
    "our calculation shows that even if the off - shell uncertainty of the @xmath66 amplitude is disregarded , quite a weak dependence of the results on the @xmath2 interaction parameters renders a precise determination of the @xmath2 interaction practically impossible ."
