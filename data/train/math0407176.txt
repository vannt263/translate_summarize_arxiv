    "observe that this coincides with the empirical values table [ optitriang ] , except for ( 6,6 ) , ( 6,8 ) and ( 8,6 ) , where it is two units above the value in the table .",
    "we start with the triangulation @xmath243 obtained by replicating @xmath81 times the triangulation of @xmath211 with @xmath244 simplices constructed in the previous theorem .",
    "it will be important later that the triangulation ( and labeling ) we choose for @xmath239 is exactly the one shown in figure  [ fig : cn ] , with @xmath245 interior edges labeled @xmath246 , @xmath247 interior edges labeled @xmath228 , and no interior edge labeled @xmath227 .",
    "the proof consists on repeatedly using the following trick : let us concentrate on two triangles of @xmath239 glued along a prism labeled , say , @xmath246 .",
    "we denote @xmath218 and @xmath248 the vertices of @xmath239 opposite to the particular edge @xmath246 we are considering ( see again figure  [ fig : quadrangle ] ) .",
    "suppose there is a convex sub - polytope of the common @xmath246-prism that is triangulated in @xmath243 .",
    "suppose also that all its simplices are joined to the same vertex @xmath249 in @xmath221 ( hence also to @xmath250 in @xmath251 ) .",
    "then , we have a bipyramid ( a suspension ) over @xmath252 , let us call it @xmath253 , triangulated by first decomposing it into its two pyramids .",
    "one would expect that a more efficient way of triangulating @xmath253 is to join its axis to all the `` equatorial '' boundary simplices ( that is to say , to all the triangles in @xmath254 ) .",
    "things are actually a bit more complicated than suggested by the above sentence . in the sentence",
    "we are implicitly assuming that the segment joining the two apices of the pyramids intersects the interior of @xmath252 ( otherwise we do not have a geometric bipyramid ) .",
    "but it is not easy to guarantee that this is indeed the case and , moreover , it is not the most efficient way of doing things .",
    "indeed , if the axis intersects the interior of @xmath252 , then the number of simplices that we get when we retriangulate equals the number of triangles in @xmath254 . but suppose , instead , that the axis intersects a boundary point @xmath159 of @xmath252 .",
    "then , we can retriangulate by joining the axis to the triangles in facets of @xmath254 that do not contain @xmath159 .",
    "one problem with this is that then we have to take care that the retriangulation of @xmath253 matches the rest of the triangulation of @xmath238 that we had .",
    "the way we guarantee this is as follows : @xmath252 is going to contain the segment @xmath255 $ ] , and all the boundary faces of @xmath252 containing @xmath159 are going to be boundary faces of @xmath230 as well . in the cayley picture of figure  [ fig:12gon - abc ]",
    "this property corresponds to @xmath252 containing a vertex of minkowski sum and part of the two boundary segments incident to it .",
    "the consequence of this is that the segment @xmath256 $ ] intersects @xmath252 in a relative interior point of the edge @xmath255 $ ] .",
    "we will call that edge the _ distinguished edge _ in the following discussion .",
    "figures  [ fig:12gon - ab ] and  [ fig:12gon - bc ] show how we implement this idea in the @xmath246 and @xmath228 prisms , respectively .",
    "the shaded areas are the polygons @xmath252 that we take in each of the prisms .     in the facet @xmath246.,height=288 ]    in the @xmath246-prism , the region @xmath252 we consider is the the antiprism obtained from @xmath230 by cutting alternate corners ( this appears as a regular 12-gon in figure  [ fig:12gon - ab ] ) together with one corner tetrahedron of the prism ( the small triangle in the top of the figure )",
    ". with that small triangle included , @xmath252 is triangulated into @xmath257 simplices , so @xmath253 is triangulated into @xmath258 simplices .",
    "the boundary of @xmath252 has @xmath259 triangles ( two more than the antiprism would have ) , but two of them are incident to the distinguished edge .",
    "hence , we can retriangulate @xmath253 into @xmath259 simplices , saving us @xmath260 simplices in total .",
    "since we have @xmath245 edges of type @xmath246 we save @xmath261 simplices .",
    "in each prism @xmath262 , we take several different polytopes @xmath252 to apply the trick , as shown in figure  [ fig:12gon - bc ] .     in the facet @xmath228.,height=288 ]    there are @xmath263 of a certain type and two of another .",
    "the type of each is very easy to deduce from the figure : the two special ones are triangular prisms ( cayley embedding of two equal triangles , one of type @xmath42 and one of type @xmath218 ) and the other ones are 3-dimensional cubes with one vertex truncated ( cayley embedding of a quadrilateral and a triangle made with three of its four vertices . in the first type the original triangulation of @xmath253 has 6 simplices , and we substitute them by four simplices : the distinguished edge of the triangular prism is one connecting the two opposite triangles , so there are four triangles in facets not containing the point @xmath159 . in the other type we originally have a triangulation into 8 simplices and substitute it by one with only 6 : the distinguished edge is incident to two quadrilateral facets of @xmath252 , and there remain another quadrilateral one ( two triangles ) plus four triangular ones . in total , we are decreasing the number of simplices by @xmath10 . since we have @xmath247 prisms of this type , we save @xmath264 simplices in total .    summing up",
    ", our final triangulation has @xmath265 simplices , as claimed .",
    "there is still one more thing that needs to be said in order to justify correctness of the construction . in the triangulation of ( almost all of ) each copy of @xmath266 we have done changes to some pyramids with base on the @xmath246 side and some on the @xmath228 side . of course",
    ", for this to be possible we need these pyramids to be disjoint . that they indeed are disjoint is easy to check in figures [ fig:12gon - ab ] and [ fig:12gon - bc ]",
    ". it just amounts to observing that the shaded regions in the two pictures do not overlap .",
    "to finish the proof of theorem  [ triangulations ] , only the equations for @xmath267 remain .",
    "the upper bound is just the substitution of @xmath268 in equation  ( [ sevenhalves ] ) .",
    "the idea for the lower bound is similar to the one in theorem  [ prism ] .",
    "[ 4xm ] the polytopal gromov norm of @xmath267 is at least @xmath269 .",

    "let @xmath57 be an affine simplicial chain representing the top relative homology class . as usual , we assume that the vertices of @xmath57 are vertices of @xmath267 and that no four simplex in @xmath57 lies in the boundary . then , the simplices in @xmath57 are of four types , depending on the number of vertices they have on the top prism : we call them `` bottom '' , `` half - bottom '' , `` half - top '' and `` top '' simplices .",
    "the bottom and top simplices need to cover the bottom and top prisms . by theorem [ prism ] there are at least @xmath270 of each type in @xmath57 .",
    "also , by the same argument as in the proof of theorem [ prism ] , the numbers of half - bottom and half - top simplices are each equal to at least that number , giving the total of @xmath269 ( rounded up to an even number ) .",
    "clearly , the definition of @xmath13 allows for much more freedom than using triangulations of @xmath14 , in order to get upper bounds . here",

    "it can be easily checked that the facets that ( b ) , ( c ) and ( f ) have in our antiprism produce the following degree one cover of it : consider the cover of the @xmath209-gon @xmath300 ( where `` * '' is meant to be even ) obtained by coning @xmath290 to the boundary . then join this cover , as well as the @xmath10 triangular faces of the antiprism , to @xmath296 .    with all this",
