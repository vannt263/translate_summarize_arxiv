    "the @xmath1 expansion method @xcite , where @xmath2 is the number of colors , has lead to a better understanding of the spin - flavor structure of baryons in the context of qcd .",
    "much work has been devoted to the ground state of light @xcite and heavy baryons @xcite .",
    "for @xmath3 the ground state is governed by an exact contracted su(2@xmath4 ) symmetry @xcite , where @xmath4 is the number of flavors .",
    "accordingly , baryon masses are degenerate at @xmath3 . for finite @xmath2 the mass",
    "splitting starts at order @xmath1 .",
    "it is customary to drop higher order corrections in the mass formula .",
    "the results on spectra and mass relations prove that the large @xmath2 world is sufficiently close to @xmath2 = 3 .    for ground state",
    "baryons the study is systematic and straightforward because the orbital wave function is symmetric and also irrelevant in the calculations .",
    "the spin - flavor wave function is also symmetric which makes quite easy to deal with it .    for excited states the symmetry",
    "is enlarged to so(3 ) @xmath5 su(2@xmath4 ) to include orbital excitations .",
    "then the system acquires a new degree of freedom , described by a specific orbital wave function , the symmetry of which must match that of the spin - flavor part , in order to lead to a totally symmetric state in the orbital - spin - flavor space .",
    "the excited states described by symmetric wave functions in both the orbital and spin - flavor degrees of freedom are nearly as simple as the ground state .",
    "results are available for the roper resonance @xmath6 $ ] @xcite , and for states belonging to the @xmath7 $ ] @xcite and to the @xmath8 $ ] @xcite multiplets respectivelys . for finite @xmath2 the mass",
    "splitting starts at order @xmath1 , like for the ground state .",
    "more complicated are the mixed symmetric states in both orbital and spin - flavor space .",
    "they belong to the @xmath9 $ ] multiplet with parity @xmath10 .",
    "starting from group theoretical arguments , here we study the su(6 ) @xmath0 $ ] multiplet for arbitrary @xmath2 and thus complete our previous work @xcite , restricted to su(4 ) ( for a review see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "we recall that the su(6 ) generators are @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 acting on spin , flavor and spin - flavor respectively .",
    "so far the most extensively studied is the @xmath14 $ ] multiplets .",
    "this is the simplest and the best known experimentally group of states .",
    "historically , the first approach , presently a standard procedure , was based on the decoupling of the system into a ground state core described by a symmetric spin - flavor state of @xmath15 quarks and an orbitally excited quark @xcite .",
    "accordingly the su(2@xmath4 ) generators were written as @xmath16 ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) , where the operators carrying the lower index @xmath19 act on the core and the lower case operators act on the excited quark .",
    "this method is in the spirit of the hartree picture and the system is described by an approximate wave function , where the orbital part has a configuration of type @xmath20 ( no antisymmetrization ) which is combined with an approximate ( truncated ) spin - flavor part .",
    "the splitting ( [ generators ] ) of the generators amounts to an excessively large number of independent operators to be included in the mass formula , difficult to handle when the data is restricted , as it usually happens . as being the first proposal in large @xmath2 baryon spectroscopy ,",
    "we have also applied it to the @xmath21 $ ] multiplet ( @xmath22 = 0 , 2 ) @xcite . consistenly with previous studies",
    ", we found that the splitting starts at order @xmath23 .",
    "there are many interesting papers in the field to be cited .",
    "however here we have to restrict the list to our specific goal .    from the studies we perfomed on the @xmath21 $ ] multiplet",
    ", we understood that a simpler procedure can as correctly be used , where no quark is decoupled from the system , all identical quarks being treated on the same footing , with an exact wave function in the orbital - flavor - spin space @xcite .",
    "we found out that the key to the problem was the knowledge of the matrix elements of all su(2@xmath4 ) generators , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 for mixed symmetric states @xmath0 $ ] . for su(4 )",
    "they were derived in ref .",
    "@xcite and for su(6 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the standard procedure",
    "the problem was simplified , by truncating the wave function to a part where a quark is decoupled from the whole system , the rest remaining in a ground state symmetric core . in this way",
    "the problem was reduced to the knowledge of the matrix elements of su(2@xmath4 ) generators for the core , in the symmetric representation @xmath24 $ ] .    to better clarify our purpose ,",
    "let us give an example in the su(4 ) standard procedure , in connection to the isospin operator .",
    "the su(2)-isospin casimir operator was written as @xmath25 , _",
    "i.e. _ formed of three independent pieces , corresponding to the terms in this decomposition . in su(4 ) @xmath26 and @xmath27 have identical matrix elements because the spin and isospin states of a symmetric core are identical , so that @xmath26 can be neglected .",
    "but @xmath28 has different matrix elements from @xmath29 as one can clearly see from table ii of ref . @xcite .",
    "then , in the decoupling scheme the isospin can be introduced only through @xmath28 . in ref .",
    "@xcite table vi we have shown that the introduction of the operators @xmath30 together with @xmath31 and @xmath32 separately deteriorates the fit .",
    "this may explain why @xmath30 has been avoided in previous numerical fits in su(4 ) @xcite .",
    "physical consequences of the neglect of the isospin operator were discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite for su(4 ) , where it was shown that the isospin term , neglected in the standard procedure , becomes as dominant in @xmath33 as the spin term in @xmath34 resonances . as a first physical application of this work , where we extend our procedure to su(6 ) we ask again the question why the operator @xmath30 , as well as @xmath26 were avoided in previous numerical fits in su(6 ) @xcite .    before presenting our work",
    "we wish to point out that the calculation of the matrix elements of the operators appearing in the mass formula , with the approximate wave function of the standard procedure is not however an approximation . in the framework of a large @xmath2 quark model , by using properties of the permutation group , pirjol and schat @xcite",
    "have shown that on can pass from the exact wave function to that of ref . @xcite without making any approximation .",
    "this implies that an approximate wave function can be used in an effective theory , provided the constraints imposed by a given quark model are satisfied .",
    "these constraints represent fixed ratios between specific coefficients in the mass formula in terms of well defined radial integrals .    by analogy to our previous work @xcite",
    ", here we analyze the spin and flavor terms both for the exact and the truncated , or else , approximate , wave function of the @xmath9 $ ] multiplet , without any prejudice . in other words",
    "we extend our previous work from su(4 ) ( @xmath4 = 2 ) to su(6 )   ( @xmath4 = 3 ) .",
    "we briefly recall the standard procedure based on the core+excited quark separation .",
    "the relation between the approximate wave function @xcite and the exact one , has been presented already in ref .",
    "@xcite . to test the validity of the approximate wave function we compare the analytical expressions of the matrix elements of the spin and flavor operators entering the mass formula . for the first time",
    "we explicitly show that at large @xmath2 the approximate wave function provides matrix elements of the flavor operator where the flavor singlet @xmath35 behaves asymtotically different from the octets @xmath36 , @xmath37 and the decuplet @xmath38 ( the notation corresponding to @xmath2 = 3 ) , which means that the large @xmath2 counting rule is broken ( see sec .",
    "[ matelem ] ) .",
    "by contrast , the exact wave functions lead to identical analytic forms at large @xmath2 for all spin - flavor multiplets belonging to the representation @xmath39 of su(6 ) allowing a consistent definition of the flavor operator .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we recall the relation between the exact and approximate wave function and derive the isoscalar factors needed for the flavor singlet @xmath35 . in sec .",
    "iii we derive analytic expressions of some dominant operators entering the mass formula and discuss their behavior at large @xmath2 for the multiplets which become @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath35 when @xmath2 = 3 , both for the approximate and the exact wave function .",
    "the last section presents our conclusions . in appendix",
    "a we recall some isoscalar factors obtained previously , but needed in this work . in appendix b we describe the procedure to obtain general analytic expression of new s@xmath40 isoscalar factors associated with the wave function of the @xmath35 multiplet .",
    "appendix c is devoted to the derivation of the matrix elements of the generator @xmath41 of su(6 ) and exhibits the su(6 ) isoscalars factors calculated in this work .",
    "we deal with a system of @xmath2 quarks where one quark carries @xmath22 units of orbital excitation .",
    "therefore the orbital ( @xmath42 ) wave function must have a mixed symmetry @xmath0 $ ] , which describes the lowest excitations in a baryon .",
    "the @xmath43 independent basis states of the @xmath0 $ ] irreducible representation ( irrep ) corresponding to @xmath43 young tableaux , as presented below , is equivalent to a basis written in terms of @xmath43 internal jacobi coordinates , thus the center of mass motion is automatically removed .",
    "the center of mass motion is then described by the symmetric state @xmath44 $ ] with one excited quark .",
    "the color wave function being antisymmetric , the orbital - spin - flavor wave part must be symmetric .",
    "then the spin - flavor ( @xmath45 ) part must have the same symmetry as the orbital part in order to obtain a totally symmetric state in the orbital - spin - flavor space .",
    "we recall that the general form of such a wave function is @xcite @xmath46 y \\rangle_{o }   |[n_c-1,1 ] y \\rangle_{fs},\\ ] ] where @xmath47 } = n_c - 1 $ ] is the dimension of the representation @xmath0 $ ] of the permutation group @xmath48 and @xmath49 is a symbol for a young tableau ( yamanouchi symbol ) .",
    "the sum is performed over all possible standard young tableaux . by convention , in each term the first basis vector represents the orbital space and the second the spin - flavor space . in this sum",
    "there is only one @xmath49 ( the normal young tableau ) where the last particle is in the second row and @xmath50 terms where the last particle is in the first row .",
    "the explicit form of the orbital part is not needed in this work .    more precisely , we write @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the row of the @xmath2-th particle , @xmath53 the row of the @xmath54-th particle and @xmath55 is the young tableau of the remaining particles .",
    "let us denote by @xmath52 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 the position of the last particle in the spin - flavor , spin and flavor young tableaux respectively .",
    "they are indicated by crosses in the example given by eqs .",
    "( [ singletch52])-([prime ] ) below .",
    "similarly for the @xmath54-th particle we have @xmath53 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 and for the rest @xmath55 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "we need now to decompose the spin - flavor wave function into its spin and flavor parts . for this purpose",
    "we use the clebsch - gordan ( cg ) coefficients of @xmath48 , denoted by @xmath62p'q'y ' [ f'']p''q''y '' | [ f]pqy ) $ ] and their factorization property @xcite . denoting by @xmath63p'[f'']p''|[f]p)$ ] the isoscalar factors of @xmath48 we have @xcite @xmath64p'q'y ' [ f'']p''q''y '' | [ f]pqy ) = k([f']p'[f'']p''|[f]p ) s([f'_{p'}]q'y ' [ f''_{p''}]q''y '' | [ f_p]qy ) , \\ ] ] where the second factor in the right - hand side is a cg coefficient of @xmath65 containing the partitions @xmath66 $ ] , @xmath67 $ ] and @xmath68 $ ] obtained after the removal of the @xmath2-th quark . keeping in mind that , for a given @xmath52 , the quantum numbers of the su(6 ) wave function are the same and by using the above property we can write the spin - flavor part of the wave function as @xmath69p'[f'']p''|[n_c-1,1]p )     where @xmath70 contains the cg coefficients @xmath71q'y ' [ f''_{p''}]q''y '' | [ f_p]qy ) $ ] and includes a sum over @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "these cg coefficients sum up to 1 by normalization .",
    "then in the matrix elements of every su(6 ) opearator we shall have one term with @xmath74 and @xmath75 terms with @xmath76 ( see example in the next section ) .    in the wave function ( [ fs ] )",
    "the spin part @xmath77 is defined by the su(2 ) coupling @xmath78 with @xmath79 for @xmath80 and @xmath81 for @xmath82 and the flavor part by the su(3 ) coupling @xmath83 = @xmath84 for @xmath57 = 1 , @xmath85 = @xmath86 for @xmath57 = 2 and @xmath85 = @xmath87 for @xmath57 = 3 . here",
