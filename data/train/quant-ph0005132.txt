    "their choice of measurement results in a high probability of correctly determining the state emitted by the source , and a large mutual information between the state and the measurement outcome .",

    "they describe a procedure for constructing a general `` decoding observable '' , corresponding to a povm consisting of rank - one operators that distinguishes between the states `` pretty well '' ; this measurement has subsequently been called the _ square - root measurement ( srm ) _",

    "however , apart from some particular cases mentioned above @xcite , no assertion of ( non - asymptotic ) optimality is known for the srm .    in this paper",
    "we systematically construct detection measurements optimized to distinguish between a collection of quantum states .",
    "motivated by the example studied by peres and wootters @xcite , we consider pure - state ensembles and seek a povm consisting of rank - one positive operators with measurement vectors that minimize the sum of the squared norms of the error vectors , where the @xmath3th error vector is defined as the difference between the @xmath3th state vector and the @xmath3th measurement vector .",
