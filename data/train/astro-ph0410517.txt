    "rvtauri stars are rare supergiants which occupy the high luminosity end of the pop . ii cepheid instability strip .",
    "they are identified on the basis of their characteristic light curves , which show alternating deep and shallow minima with periods between 30 and 150 days .",
    "their post - agb nature is established on the basis of their far - ir excess due to circumstellar dust , which is thought to be a relic of the dusty mass loss at the end of the agb .",
    "the genuine high luminosity nature of this rvtauri class was established by the detection of some members in globular clusters and the lmc .",
    "post - agb objects are very useful in constraining the agb chemical evolutionary models , because the absence of strong molecular veiling allows detection of atomic transitions from cno up to the heavy s - process elements beyond the ba - peak .",
    "high resolution spectra of v453oph and dsaqr were acquired with the spectrograph feros , mounted on the 1.5 m telescope at la silla .",
    "these spectra in combination with the latest kurucz model atmospheres were employed to derive accurate abundances for both objects .",
    "the parameters for the model atmospheres were determined using spectroscopic criteria only ( using the fe lines ) .",
    "the resulting model parameters are shown in table [ modelparameters ] .",
    "the huge number of fe lines ( 136 and 316 for v453oph and dsaqr respectively ) ensures an accurate determination of these values .",
    ".the model parameters of v453oph and dsaqr as determined using the fe lines .",
    "the derived cno abundances for both objects are also given .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,^ , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]",
    "for both objects we performed a very detailed chemical abundance analysis . all lines in the spectra showing a clear and symmetric profile",
    "were measured and subsequently identified on the basis of wavelength . for each of these lines ,",
    "the most recent atomic data was researched in the literature . to eliminate possible biasing in the atomic data , a strict relative analysis between both objects",
    "was performed using exactly the same lines for both objects . because of the very similar atmospheric parameters , these relative abundances are less sensitive to possible systematic errors in general .",
    "the result of the absolute abundance analysis ( i.e. for each object independently ) reveals that v453oph is mildly enriched in s - process elements while dsaqr is not .",
    "therefore , the relative abundance analysis of v453oph @xmath2 dsaqr , depicted in fig.[relative_analysis ] , gives extremely accurate s - process enrichment values .",
    "some of the s - process lines used in the analysis are shown in the left panel of fig.[sample_spectra ] . although v453oph is s - process enriched , the c abundance as derived from a spectrum synthesis ( shown in the right panel of fig.[sample_spectra ] ) , is very similar to dsaqr ( see table [ modelparameters ] ) .",
    "in general , two different scenarios are invoked to explain the s - process enrichment : in the less massive objects , the @xmath3c(@xmath4,n)@xmath5o reaction , which takes place under radiative conditions , is nowadays believed to be the major neutron source @xcite . for hot agb stars , however , another s - process scenario is also invoked .",
    "it concerns the production of s - elements under convective conditions by the @xmath6ne(@xmath4,n)@xmath7 mg neutron source .",
    "both scenarios were explored in order to explain the s - enrichment of v453oph without a c enhancement . in the following ,",
    "these scenarios are referred to as radiative and convective s - process models .",
    "the most favoured s - process model is associated with the partial mixing of protons ( pmp ) into the radiative c - rich layers at the time of the third dredge - up ( 3dup ) .",
    "s - process calculations were performed using this pmp model for an 1.5  z=0.0001 agb model star .",
    "the model has been evolved selfconsistently up to the 49th interpulse - pulse sequence .",
    "however , no 3dup is found to take place , so that only a mild s - process develops in the convective pulse through the @xmath6ne(@xmath4,n)@xmath7 mg neutron source . at the end of the 49th pulse , protons",
    "are artificially injected into the c - rich layers to simulate the pmp scenario ( as described in @xcite ) .",
    "an efficient s - process develops in the radiative zone and after the 50th pulse , a 3dup is assumed .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "[ agb_enrichment ] compares the observed abundances with the radiative s - process model predictions .",
    "clearly , the abundance distribution agrees well with the observations .",
    "however , the overabundance obtained for c ( [ c / fe]@xmath8 ) is incompatible with the observed value ( [ c / fe]@xmath9 ) .    in the convective model",
    ", the s - process originates exclusively from the neutron irradiation due to the @xmath6ne(@xmath4,n)@xmath7 mg source , requiring temperatures of about 3.5 10@xmath10k . in the 1.5  z=0.0001 model star ,",
    "the maximum temperature at the bottom of the thermal pulse amounts to about 3.3 10@xmath10k . to allow an s - process to develop in the pulse",
    ", the @xmath6ne(@xmath4,n)@xmath7 mg reaction rate has been increased by a factor of 10 with respect to the nacre recommended rate .",
    "this value is well within the uncertanties still affecting this rate @xcite . with this increased rate , the full sequence of the 50 pulse - interpulse in the 1.5  z=0.0001 model star",
    "have been calculated ending with a parametrized dredge - up .",
    "the resulting elemental abundance distribution is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ agb_enrichment ] to reproduce the observations satisfactorily .",
    "however , the c prediction ( [ c / fe]@xmath11 ) is again not compatible with the observations .",
    "the only model that does provide a compatible c abundance with observations is a 3  z=0.0001 model star . in this case , temperatures as high as 3.7 10@xmath10k are encountered and a significant s - process takes place .",
    "the resulting surface enrichment obtained assuming a dredge - up at the end of the 18th computed pulse is given in fig .",
    "[ agb_enrichment ] and is again in good agreement with the observations .",
    "even the predicted c abundance ( [ c / fe]@xmath12 ) is in agreement with the observations .",
    "therefore this seems the only model able to reproduce simultaneously the s - process enrichment and the low c abundance .",
    "however , a 3  star with the very low metallicity of v453oph is very unlikely from evolutionary viewpoint .",
    "this paper reports upon the abundance analysis of a very particular s - process enriched object : v453oph .",
    "the abundances derived for this object are of particular nucleosynthesis interest , since for the first time , the s - process enrichment is not accompanied by a simultaneous c - enrichment .",
    "this observation provides us with clear proof that our knowledge about the agb nucleosynthesis is still unsatisfactory because no current model can fully reproduce the specific history of this object ."
