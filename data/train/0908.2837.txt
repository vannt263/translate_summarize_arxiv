    "dwarf irregular galaxies are among the most numerous galaxies known and as such are a fundamental component of the universe .",
    "they are the most common type of galaxy within the local group , and are thought to be the building blocks of larger galaxies . despite their numbers and proximity they are still among the least understood of objects",
    ". we do nt know how these galaxies form stars or how they have evolved to become the galaxies we see today .",
    "as such , it is essential that we work towards understanding the forces at work within them , and the processes which have shaped them .",
    "understanding the large and small - scale star formation processes in dwarf galaxies has long posed a problem to the current models . in the classic toomre instability ( toomre 1964 ) there is a specific column density ( @xmath8 ) needed for a ring - like perturbation to grow exponentially .",
    "this model seems to work well in the inner regions of most spirals ( kennicutt 1989 ; martin & kennicutt 2001 ) .",
    "dwarf galaxies are so bereft of gas , however , that in many cases @xmath8 is never reached , even in the centers where the gas column density is highest ( unless the velocity dispersion is very low  de blok & walter 2006 ) .",
    "still , we see star formation not only in these centers , but even in the outer reaches of the disk where the gas density to critical density ratio ( @xmath9/@xmath8@xmath10 1/q ) is considerably lower than unity .",
    "similarly , the outer disks of spirals and some entire spiral disks are subcritical ( martin & kennicutt 2001 ) .",
    "one possibility is that localized processes dominate in the absence of large - scale instabilities ( e.g. , elmegreen & hunter 2006 ) .",
    "another possibility is that stars and gas together promote the gravitational instabilities that lead to star formation ( e.g. , yang et al .",
    "a third possibility is that the gas is unstable even in subthreshold environments , but the instability growth time is long  comparable to the time for angular momentum to leave a growing perturbation through viscous and magnetic forces ( elmegreen 1987 ) . in all three cases ,",
    "dwarf galaxies offer insight into star formation without the influence of spiral density waves .    in this paper",
    "we compare the properties of individual star - forming regions in outer and inner disks of a sample of dwarf galaxies .",
    "the young regions are identified on _ galex _ ( galaxy evolutionary explorer ; martin et al .",
    "2005 ) near - uv ( @xmath11 ) images .",
    "we use far - uv ( @xmath12 ) and @xmath11 , @xmath13 , and some @xmath14 colors to model the masses and ages of the regions .",
    "our investigation includes approximately 2000 separate star - forming regions . with these data we compare mass , age , and several other key properties of star - forming regions in inner and outer disks .",
    "star forming regions in galaxies are also useful for studies of cluster evolution , particularly regarding fading from stellar evolution and mass loss , and cluster disruption through cloud collisions and other processes . an important diagram for these studies is a plot of @xmath15 versus @xmath16 for cluster mass @xmath17 and age @xmath18 .",
    "such a plot shows a uniform distribution of points over a range of @xmath16 for each interval of @xmath15 above the magnitude detection threshold for the survey ( hunter et al .",
    "2003 ; rafelski & zaritsky 2005 ; fall , chandar & whitmore 2005 ; bastian et al . 2005a ; whitmore , chandar , & fall 2007 ) .",
    "the plot also shows a cluster count decreasing as @xmath19 over a range of @xmath15 for each interval of @xmath16 .",
    "the implication of the former trend is that cluster count @xmath20 decreases in equal intervals of age as @xmath21 for all observable masses ( fall et al .",
    "the implication of the latter is that @xmath20 decreases in equal intervals of mass as @xmath22 for all observable ages ( elmegreen & efremov 1997 ; zhang & fall 1999 ; hunter et al .",
    "2003 ; de grijs & anders 2006 ) . here",
    "we study these diagrams for our sample of galaxies , finding the same trends , and also study in more detail the distribution of region surface brightness and radius with age . in ",
    "2 we discuss the images used in our survey .  3 describes the means by which we calculated the photometry for our star - forming regions , as well as a discussion of our age and mass modeling process .",
    "one of the principle goals of this survey was to examine radial trends within the dwarf galaxies , and  4 discusses these radial trends . in  5 we present a discussion of some of the major results of our survey : ",
    "5.1 considers the surface brightness evolution of regions in four best - case galaxies , showing a trend with age that is steeper than from stellar evolution fading alone .",
    "this suggests a specific pattern of mass loss in each region that results from surface brightness limitations .",
    "it is a mass loss that is independent of stellar evolution , evaporation , and region disruption .",
    "size - of - sample effects regarding surface brightness are also discussed .",
    " 5.2 reviews the @xmath23 plots with a comment about the implied time dependence of region mass , ",
    "5.3 suggests that outer disk h@xmath1 is missing because of faintness , not variations in the initial mass function ( see also hunter , elmegreen & ludka 2009 ) ,  5.4 comments on variations in the star formation rate ,  5.5 examines outer disk hi column densities and suggests mechanisms for sub - threshold star formation , and  5.6 notes the size - of - sample effects in our observations .",
    "lastly ,  6 provides a general overview and summary of what we have learned about the star formation processes in dwarf galaxies .",
    "also included is an appendix in which the properties of the individual galaxies within our survey are discussed .",
    "the galaxies in this investigation are a sub - sample of a large multi - wavelength survey of 136 relatively normal nearby galaxies without spiral arms ( 94 dim , 24 blue compact dwarfs , and 18 sm galaxies ; hunter & elmegreen 2004 , 2006 ) .",
    "that survey is representative of the range in galactic parameters exhibited by dwarfs , and is aimed at understanding star formation processes in dwarf galaxies .",
    "the @xmath24 and h@xmath1  data obtained as part of that survey are described by hunter and elmegreen .    to extend this survey into the uv",
    ", we obtained images from the _ galex _ archives for 44 of our 136 dwarf galaxies .",
    "these data are part of a study of azimuthally - averaged uv properties in hunter et al .",
    "for the present study , we selected 11 dim galaxies from this _ galex _ sample , all within 3.6 mpc of the sun , to measure the properties of individual star - forming regions .",
    "these data are combined with comparable measurements on our @xmath13 and h@xmath1  images and on @xmath14 images of one of the galaxies .",
    "the galaxies that are part of the present study are listed in table [ tab - sample ] along with several basic properties .",
    "_ galex _ exposure times and tile names are given in table [ tab - obs ] .",
    "_ galex _ images were taken simultaneously in two channels : @xmath12 , with a bandpass of 13501750  , an effective wavelength of 1516  , and a resolution of 4.0 and @xmath11 with a bandpass of 17502800  , an effective wavelength of 2267  , and a resolution of 5.6 .",
    "the images were processed through the _ galex _ pipeline , and we retrieved final intensity maps with a 1.5pixel scale from the archives .",
    "the _ galex _",
    "field of view is a circle with 1.2  diameter ; we extracted a portion around our target galaxies .",
    "we edited foreground stars and background galaxies , and removed sky from the _ galex _ @xmath11 and @xmath12 images . in some cases",
    "the sky was a constant determined from regions around the galaxy , but in other cases the sky was determined from a low - order , two - dimensional fit to the surroundings .",
    "we geometrically transformed the uv images to match the orientation and scale of our @xmath24 images . in that way we could identify regions on the @xmath11 images and then easily measure fluxes on all of the @xmath24 , @xmath12 , and @xmath11 images using the same extraction apertures .",
    "we identified individual star - forming regions on the @xmath11 images , measured their fluxes on all of our broad - band images , and subtracted the background galaxy light .",
    "we corrected these fluxes to the standard photometric systems .",
    "we then applied bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) stellar population models to our colors and luminosities to determine the ages and masses of the star - forming regions .",
    "these ages and masses were studied with respect to galactocentric radius and other variables .",
    "we marked with polygons all of the individual knots of star formation seen in the @xmath11 images .",
    "these regions are defined as spots or clumps that stand out against the diffuse background disk emission .",
    "the polygons were then applied to all the other image passbands that we have for each galaxy .",
    "the regions were identified by eye .",
    "one source of uncertainty comes from the occasional difficulty of distinguishing foreground stars from star - forming regions in the galaxies at the resolution of the @xmath11 images , especially for the more distant galaxies .",
    "although foreground stars are preferentially red , we did not wish to bias the regions to only the youngest by selecting only blue objects .",
    "instead , we limited the sample to galaxies within 3.6 mpc where the resolution of the @xmath11 image is about 100 pc .",
    "thus , most young regions are resolved .",
    "the star - forming regions sit on a diffuse disk of galactic uv emission .",
    "we needed to determine the underlying emission for each region in order to measure the photometric properties of the star - forming sites themselves .",
    "where we could , we subtracted the mode of an annulus starting 5 pixels out from the longest radius of the defining polygon and extending another 5 pixels in radius .    however , because of the clustered nature of these sources , this was out of the question for the majority of them .",
    "there were often one or several other regions within bounds of a reasonable annulus centered on the target region .",
    "we specifically wanted to avoid subtracting one region from another , so in these cases we found several background spots close to , but separated from , the star - forming region and used the median in these regions to characterize the underlying disk .",
    "the separated background apertures identified on @xmath11 images were also used as background regions for the other passbands .",
    "the background emission was defined to be the median pixel value within the background region closest to the star - forming region .",
    "this median pixel value was subtracted from each pixel in the target star - forming region to get the flux from the star - forming region alone .    to check our determination of the background in the case of the separate background regions , we determined the sky using an alternate algorithm ( the mode ) in one galaxy , ddo 50 , using the same background regions we had used with the original ( median ) photometry .",
    "the purpose was to ensure that the background value was not biased by the occasional star that would appear in a background region in the optical that was not there in the uv .",
    "the lack of disagreement or the presence of an offset between background values determined using the two methods suggest that our background values in separate regions are robust against this particular problem .",
    "after the underlying galactic disk was subtracted , we transformed the fluxes to the standard _ galex _ , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 systems .",
    "the uv data are in ab magnitudes .",
    "the @xmath13 photometry is on the landolt ( 1992 ) system , and the @xmath14 fluxes were calibrated with ukirt standard stars ( see hawarden et al .",
    "[ 2001 ] for a discussion of near - ir photometric systems ) .",
    "we calculated m@xmath25 , m@xmath26 , and m@xmath27 , as well as the colors @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .",
    "the uncertainties in the magnitudes and colors reflect poisson statistics in both the signal and in the sky .",
    "we corrected the photometry for extinction using the same total reddening e(@xmath29)@xmath33 as was used in our earlier study of the @xmath24 images ( hunter & elmegreen 2006 ) .",
    "the total reddening e(@xmath29)@xmath33 is foreground e(@xmath29)@xmath34 from burstein & heiles ( 1984 ) given in table [ tab - sample ] plus a constant 0.05 mag for reddening internal to the dwarf galaxy .",
    "a constant internal reddening of this order for the stars is consistent with measurements of the balmer decrement in hii regions in a sample of 39 dim galaxies ( hunter & hoffman 1999 ) .",
    "there the average reddening in hii regions is 0.1 , and we have taken half this to represent the stars outside of hii regions . we combined the e(@xmath29)@xmath33 with the reddening law of cardelli et al .",
    "( 1989 ) to produce the extinction in each filter .",
    "for the _ galex _ filters , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the photometry for all of the regions are given in table [ tab - phot ] , which is available in its entirety on - line , and the @xmath14 photometry for the regions in ngc 2366 are given in table [ tab - jhk ] .",
    "there are , in total , 1920 regions for all 11 galaxies .",
    "there are @xmath28 colors for 1913 of them ; 1792 of the 1920 have @xmath29 colors and 43 have @xmath31 .",
    "we removed regions from our sample with various problems with the photometry , including photometric errors greater than 1 magnitude , contamination by foreground stars , unphysical colors , and incomplete photometry .",
    "we were left with 1623 star - forming regions with good photometry .",
    "one reason for the incompleteness of optical and near - ir colors is that star - forming regions bright in the @xmath11 are not necessarily bright in the other bands , and can be lost in the galaxy background .",
    "regions with a few thousand counts in the uv might only have a few hundred counts in @xmath37 .",
    "in addition , the lower the flux that a region has , the more susceptible it is to uncertainties in sky subtraction . for any of our regions with highly uncertain colors",
    ", there was a good probability that our models would be unable to find a realistic fit .",
    "that is why we removed all of the star - forming regions with any photometric errors greater than 1 magnitude .",
    "another factor working against the smaller regions is that they are often too faint to be seen at greater distances . while our survey is complete at a level of @xmath38 or @xmath39 mag in m@xmath26 , below an m@xmath26 of @xmath40 mag it is incomplete . for the closer galaxies , those less than 1 mpc away , such as ngc 6822 and ic 1613 , this was not a problem , but at the longer distances of @xmath41 mpc this effect became more apparent .",
    "this problem is illustrated in figure [ fig - disthist ] , where the distributions of @xmath42 for all of the star forming regions in ngc 6822 and ddo 50 are shown .",
    "ddo 50 at 3.4 mpc has a higher proportion of brighter regions , probably from blending effects , and ngc 6822 at 0.5 mpc peaks at much fainter levels .    to explore the consequences of distance on our results , we have taken wlm , which is nominally at a distance of 1 mpc , and smoothed the images with a gaussian kernel to the resolution we would expect at a distance of 3.4 mpc , the distance of ddo 50 .",
    "we then analyzed the smoothed images , including identifying uv - bright regions and background regions , performing the photometry , and running models .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig - wlm ] where we compare the region ages and masses as a function of radius from the original 1 mpc images and from the pseudo-3.4 mpc images . at 3.4 mpc , we see fewer regions with more mass and shallower radial gradients , as expected , but general trends remain . age - mass ratios , for example ,",
    "are roughly the same . from a similar comparison of the other figures that we use in our discussion ,",
    "we believe that the results for the more distant galaxies included here , particularly ddo 50 at 3.4 mpc , are as valid as those for the closer systems , especially since our emphasis in this study is on radial trends within galaxies , rather than differences between galaxies .      in order to compare star forming regions ,",
    "we determine the ages and masses by finding the best model fit to the colors for each region .",
    "the model colors are from the bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) model stellar populations with the `` padova 1994 '' stellar evolutionary tracks ( alongi et al .",
    "1993 , bressan et al .  1993 ,",
    "fagotto et al .",
    "1994a , b ) .",
    "we use a chabrier ( 2003 ) stellar initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "this imf adopts the salpeter ( 1955 ) imf for stellar masses above 1 m_@xmath43 .",
    "below 1 m_@xmath43the imf is shallower than salpeter s and below 0.3 m_@xmath43 , it flattens out .",
    "mass - to - light ratios are of order 1.4 - 1.8 times smaller with a chabrier imf compared to a salpeter imf .",
    "we used the @xmath44 or @xmath45 metallicity models , whichever was closer to the metallicity expected from nebular oxygen abundances ( hunter & hoffman 1999 ) or , for ddo 210 and lgs3 , estimated from the mass - metallicity relationship .",
    "thus , we used @xmath44 models for all galaxies except ngc 2366 and ngc 6822 .",
    "we also use an exponentially decaying star formation history with a decay time of 1 gyr for all regions . for the short ages we obtain here ,",
    "this means nearly continuous star formation over the age of the region .",
    "our modeling program loops over age and finds model colors . for each model color",
    "we subtract the observed color and divide the difference by the uncertainty in the measured color .",
    "we then sum the square of this difference over the colors .",
    "this is a @xmath46 . among all possible solutions ,",
    "we then average with an exp(@xmath47 ) weighting factor to obtain a final age and mass .",
    "the uncertainties in many of our colors are sufficiently small compared to the model spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fits that the @xmath46 values were unreasonably large ( often greater than 40 ) .",
    "so , we multiplied all of the color uncertainties by a constant factor of 5 for all regions in order to get non - zero gaussian weights .",
    "this is effectively the same as considering greater than statistical uncertainties , or systematic uncertainties , in the observations and models . in a small number of cases",
    "the @xmath46 method does not find a good solution at all .",
    "we considered this to be the case when 5 or fewer of the age models out of the 164 trial ages in the bruzual & charlot tables with ages larger than 2.3 myr gave @xmath48 .",
    "we then modified our method to obtain the best possible sed fit by averaging together the trial ages and masses from only those age trials that had the lowest rms deviation between the observed and modeled colors ( i.e. , not dividing by the measurement errors as in the @xmath46 method ) .",
    "the weights for this average were taken to be gaussian functions of this rms deviation , rather than @xmath46 .",
    "the uncertainties in the results for these cases were taken from the rms values in the averages .",
    "the final model age , mass , and rms of the fit are given for each region in table [ tab - phot ] .",
    "as a test of the modeling , we tried our model on some well known clusters : ngc 104 ( 47 tuc ) , a galactic globular cluster , and ngc 604 , a large young ob association in m33 .",
    "we obtained @xmath13 colors for ngc 104 from harris ( 1996 ) and measured them for ngc 604 from the local group survey data ( massey et al .",
    "we measured @xmath28 for both clusters from _ galex _ archive images .",
    "both sources had their background light subtracted .",
    "we adopt an e(@xmath29 ) of 0.04 for ngc 104 from salaris et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and harris ( 1996 ) , and use @xmath44 models , the closest model to the metallicity of the cluster ( [ fe / h]@xmath49 , harris 1996 ) .",
    "we find an age of @xmath50 gyrs , and a mass of @xmath51 for ngc 104 .",
    "our age agrees very well with recent estimates : 1013 gyrs ( salaris et al .  2007 ) , 12.5@xmath520.5 gyr ( liu & chaboyer 2000 ) , 10.9@xmath521.4 gyr ( salaris et al .  2004 ) , and 11.5@xmath520.8 gyr ( vandenberg 2000 ) .",
    "similarly , our mass agrees well with the mass of @xmath53 determined by meylan ( 1988 ) from dynamics , surface photometry , and a two power - law imf of ngc 104 .    for ngc 604 , based on the number of observed o stars and a salpeter stellar imf ,",
    "the mass was previously determined to be @xmath54 , with an age of 3 - 5 myrs ( hunter et al .",
    "for the models , we use an e(@xmath29 ) of 0.05 , as adopted by hunter et al . , and a salpeter stellar imf .",
    "the oxygen abundance of ngc 604 is about half solar ( diaz et al .",
    "1987 , caffau et al .",
    "2008 ) , so we use the bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) tables with 0.4 times solar metallicity .",
    "then , including the galex @xmath28 colors , the models give a mass of @xmath55 and an age of 5 myrs .",
    "these agree with measured values to within a factor of 2 .",
    "the model age and mass increase by factors of 2 and 1.3 if @xmath29 and @xmath30 colors are increased and decreased , respectively , by 0.1 mag to account for bright emission lines in the @xmath56 and @xmath37 bands .    because our survey was based on @xmath11 images , it was not sensitive to red , and therefore old , things .",
    "it is doubtful that we would see modest star - forming regions much older than 500 myrs because of this .",
    "there is also some uncertainty in the models due to the rapidly changing agb phases for the age range of 0.3 - 2 gyrs ( maraston 2005 ) .",
    "while this problem is more pronounced in the ir than it is in the optical , between these two problems we feel that our models are reasonably accurate up to @xmath57500 myr of age , and this is the age range we emphasize here .",
    "similarly , we have a lower age limit of 2.3 myr .",
    "this is the point where the colors begin to change with population age . to start earlier than this",
    "is to say that we can actually see a cluster that is @xmath58 yr old , for example , and in fact , such clusters are probably obscured in the uv .",
    "there is no color and stellar evolution before this time in the models .",
    "one additional issue merits discussion . in modeling",
    "star clusters in the antennae galaxies , fall et al .",
    "( 2005 ) found a sharp - edged gap at ages of 10 myrs .",
    "this is due to the integrated light of massive clusters at high metallicity being dominated by red supergiant stars .",
    "the cluster colors change so abruptly during this phase ( 8 - 16 myrs ) that the model ages become degenerate and avoid ages of 10 myrs .",
    "this is easily understood in the `` conti scenario '' of massive star evolution in which massive stars spend proportionately less of their he - burning lifetimes as rsgs rather than wrs at higher metallicities ( massey & johnson 1998 ) .",
    "on the other hand , we benefit from the dependence of massive star evolution on metallicity as this effect will be less pronounced in low metallicity systems ( compare , for example , @xmath59 with @xmath44 in figures 57 and 59 of leitherer et al .  1999 ) . furthermore , for fall et al .",
    "this issue introduced errors of less than 0.4 in @xmath16 .",
    "thus , any gaps we see in the age distributions here are interpreted as lulls in the cluster formation rate .",
    "with this survey we now have masses and ages for 1623 star - forming regions in 11 local group dims .",
    "we also have a rough measure of sizes from the polygon fits . over the range of our survey",
    "we see ages from our lower limit of several million years to our completeness limit of 500 myrs , and masses from millions of solar masses down to just dozens of solar masses .",
    "the individual galaxies are discussed in appendix [ app - indiv ] .",
    "we are particularly interested in how different properties of the star - forming regions vary with radius within each galaxy , specifically mass , age , size , and number of regions per unit area .",
    "to show a few of these basic properties , for each galaxy we plot mass against age , mass against galactocentric radius , and age against radius in figure [ fig - plots ] .",
    "the figure shows several things : the relative abundances of star - forming regions at various masses and ages , the lower mass sensitivity limit for each galaxy as a function of age , the upper age limit for consistent detections , and the lower age limit of the models . in the plots of mass or age against radius , it is possible to see radial trends that may be present .",
    "we also show the history of star formation in equal intervals of log - age in figure [ fig - numvsage ] .",
    "this plots the total number of regions , and the number of regions more massive than the observational limit at an age of 500 myr , and the maximum mass of the regions , all as functions of age .",
    "we are interested in comparing the properties of star - forming regions in the inner and outer disks .",
    "we have made this division in three ways .",
    "first , we cut at the radius @xmath60  beyond which h@xmath1  emission is no longer detected . in some of our galaxies",
    "we find a significant number of star - forming regions past @xmath60 , and we compare the regions inside @xmath60  with those outside @xmath60 . these are shown as different colors in figures [ fig - plots ] and [ fig - numvsage ] .",
    "generally there is little difference in the masses and ages for the regions inside and outside @xmath60 .",
    "second , we cut by the number of regions we identified , comparing the inner 50% of star forming regions to the outer 50% .",
    "galaxies with few uv - selected regions beyond @xmath60  are displayed this way in figure [ fig - plots ] as indicated by the panel labels .",
    "we show this also for ngc 6822 , ddo 50 , and ngc 2366 in figure [ fig - histd50n6822 ] , where it is clear for ngc 6822 that there is little difference in the masses and ages for these two sectors .",
    "this is typically the case .",
    "ddo 50 and ngc 2366 differ , however , in that the masses are systematically lower in the outer regions , as shown in figure [ fig - plots ] also .    finally , we cut at the radius where there is a break in the broad - band surface brightness profile @xmath61 .",
    "three galaxies ( ddo 75 , ddo 216 , and m81dwa ) show double exponential radial profiles : sharp changes in the rate of decline of the exponential disk seen in broad - band stellar surface brightness profiles . these breaks are seen in optical and mid - ir ( 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath62 m ) passbands that emphasize all but the youngest stars and do not represent the `` edge '' of the disk , but rather a change in the stellar profile .",
    "the breaks do not correspond to a particular surface brightness limit , and their relationship to identified star - forming regions is inconsistent .",
    "the break in ddo 216 occurs well past where we see star - forming regions ; in m81dwa there were only two identified young regions anyway ; and in ddo 75 there are a substantial number of regions past the break . for ddo 75",
    ", we compare the ensemble of regions on either side of the broad - band profile break in figure [ fig - d75 ] , showing little difference .    the last two galaxies in figure [ fig - plots ]",
    "are plotted without distinction between inner and outer regions : lgs3 and m81dwa have a few uv regions but no h@xmath1 regions .    for galaxies with enough star - forming regions ,",
    "we look at the luminosity and number of regions per unit area as functions of radius .",
    "these are shown in figure [ fig - lumrad ] .",
    "the distributions are similar to each other because the region masses , luminosities , and sizes do not vary much with radius .",
    "figure [ fig - fillingfactor ] shows the summed angular filling factors of the uv star - forming regions versus radius and figure [ fig - radii ] shows the region sizes ( the radius of a circle that has the same area as the polygon that defines the region ) measured on the @xmath11 images .",
    "recall that the sizes are only estimates from the subjective polygonal outlines of the regions ; the filling factors use these sizes , and are therefore only approximate as well but for looking for general trends they are adequate .",
    "the figure indicates that filling factors approach @xmath63% in the inner regions .",
    "the filling factor profiles are similar to the luminosity and count density profiles because the sizes are about constant with radius .",
    "exceptions occur for the few cases where region size or mass suddenly change at large radii , as for ddo 50 , where the mass decreases and the size increases beyond 4 kpc , as compared to the rest of the galaxy . in this case",
    "the filling factor , which follows the size and the count density , drops more slowly in the outer part than the luminosity density , which follows the mass and the count density .",
    "this trend seems to be an exception , however .",
    "the five types of radial profiles  region mass , luminosity density , count density , filling factor , and size  consistently indicate that the exponential profile of star formation , and presumably the exponential disk itself , is the result of an exponentially decreasing count of star - forming regions , each with about the same mass , luminosity , and size .",
    "the filling factor of star formation decreases too .",
    "the interpretation is that the basic star - forming unit has constant mass and luminosity throughout a galaxy disk , even beyond the edge of visible hii regions , while the star formation rate is proportional to the number density of these regions , which happens to be proportional to the local stellar surface density .",
    "the reason for the latter proportionality is unknown , but has the effect of reinforcing the existing underlying exponential profile with each addition of new stars .",
    "there is generally a smooth continuation of radial trends beyond @xmath60 , which means that the loss of h@xmath1  does not correspond to a change in any physical process related to star formation .",
    "it is more likely an observational artifact , resulting perhaps from an hii region surface brightness that is below the detection limit in the outer galaxy .",
    "this is to be expected in a low pressure environment ( elmegreen & hunter 2006 ) , because of both the diffuse nature of ionization bounded hii regions at very low pressure , and the likely escape of lyman continuum photons from the star - forming regions when the surrounding density is low .",
    "surveys of star - forming regions are limited by surface brightness for the detection of faint extended objects , rather than by magnitude for point sources . to understand our detection limits better and to investigate the evolution of surface brightness , we determined the average @xmath11 surface brightness of each region , @xmath64 , from the @xmath11 magnitude on the ab scale interpolated to an arcsec angular size . for resolved regions ,",
    "this surface brightness is independent of galactic distance .",
    "it has a lower limit that depends on the exposure time of the image and perhaps the de - projected galactocentric radius ( because of the bias that a selected region must stand out above the surrounding disk ) .",
    "the lower limit should not depend on age .",
    "figure [ fig - sbvsdist ] shows the @xmath11 surface brightness versus galactocentric distance for four of our galaxies that have a large sample of regions .",
    "the lower limit to surface brightness depends on exposure time ( table 2 ) : ngc 6822 has over 3.4 times the exposure time in the @xmath11 than the other galaxies , and a limit that is @xmath65 mag arcsec@xmath3 fainter .",
    "there is no evident dependence on distance from the galaxy center in @xmath64 for ngc 6822 , but there is a small dependence for the other galaxies in the figure .",
    "this reflects a limited bias in the selection of regions for measurement , but should not be important in studies involving age or mass correlations .",
    "figure [ fig - regsb ] shows @xmath64 versus age for the same four galaxies .",
    "dashed lines indicate the fading trend from the evolution of a single stellar population model , for which luminosity decreases with time approximately as @xmath66 (  [ sect : destroy ] ) .",
    "star - forming regions approximately follow the fading trend down to the surface brightness limit , although the distribution of points is actually steeper than this for some galaxies .",
    "this steepness suggests either a physical expansion over time for each region or a loss of mass over time , beyond the loss from stellar evolution ( which is included in the fading trend ) .",
    "the oldest regions are all above the fading trend because of surface brightness limitations .",
    "that is , many old regions are missing from our survey , i.e. , those below the surface brightness limit on the extrapolated downward trend in the figure .",
    "we have not lost proportionally as many younger regions by surface brightness fading .",
    "the dividing age is around @xmath67 yrs for this sample . in general , the dividing age between detection and loss from surface brightness limits depends on the exposure time and the background noise in the image ( in addition to the local galactic surface brightness , as in fig . [ fig - sbvsdist ] ) .",
    "there is an interesting size - of - sample effect in figure [ fig - regsb ] .",
    "the upper limit to the surface brightness decreases with age much more slowly than the lower limit , indicating that most of the older regions still observed today were intrinsically brighter than the younger regions when they formed . only the faintest observed old regions , i.e. , those at the surface brightness limit , are an extrapolation of young regions along the fading trend , and then it is only the brightest young regions that can be extrapolated to fit in this way .",
    "this increase of initial surface brightness with age is a size - of - sample effect , considering that the sample size of regions in logarithmic intervals of increasing age is also increasing in proportion to the age .",
    "the older logarithmic bins include more total regions and therefore a few rare regions of intrinsically large initial surface brightness .",
    "extrapolated back to their youth , the brightest old regions today would have had @xmath68 mag arcsec@xmath3 at an age of @xmath69 yrs .",
    "there are no regions in our galaxies as bright as this today , although the embedded bright source in ngc 2366 would be of comparable brightness in the absence of extinction .",
    "figure [ fig - radiusvsage ] shows the region radius versus age for the same four galaxies as in figure [ fig - regsb ] .",
    "the radius is about constant with age , suggesting very little expansion . considering that surface brightness is from a combination of mass , luminosity - to - mass ratio , and radius",
    ", this constant radius implies that the steep decrease in surface brightness with age seen in figure [ fig - regsb ] is from a combination of stellar evolution fading and a loss of stellar mass .",
    "this mass loss must be in addition to supernovae and stellar winds , i.e. , to normal evolutionary effects .",
    "the implication is that detected clusters have lost mass since they formed .",
    "figure [ fig - mnuvvsage ] shows the fading - corrected absolute magnitude of each region in these four galaxies , versus the log of the age , @xmath18 . fading correction",
    "is done by subtracting @xmath70 from each absolute magnitude . recall that the luminosity of a region is proportional to the region mass , @xmath17 , multiplied by the light - to - mass ratio , and this latter quantity varies with age approximately as @xmath71 (  [ sect : destroy ] ) .",
    "the luminosity is also proportional to @xmath72 , so it follows that @xmath73 , or @xmath74 the quantity on the right is shown in figure [ fig - mnuvvsage ] versus @xmath16 .",

    "the number of clusters per unit age in each mass interval decreases like @xmath85 , which in a mass - age diagram like figure [ fig - plots ] , means that the density of points is approximately constant along horizontal strips ( fall , chandar , & whitmore 2005 ) .",
    "this constancy is also evident in figure [ fig - numvsage ] as a nearly flat histogram of cluster counts above the threshold mass limit .",
    "such a time depletion implies that clusters are losing mass or getting disrupted constantly .",

    "2003 ) , with no preferred loss of low mass clusters in older age groups . in the case where each cluster loses mass like @xmath86 , which is one way to give the observed distribution on the mass - age plane",
    ", the lack of a low mass turnover in the cluster mass function implies that the lowest mass clusters are lost from the survey because of fading limitations , and not disruption . because the galaxies in the present survey are dwarf irregulars with internal tidal forces like those in the smc and lmc , and because brightness limits are higher for the present survey than for the lmc and smc",
    ", we expect that fading is the dominant cause for the loss of low mass clusters in the present survey too .",
    "if physical disruption were the cause instead , then there would be a gap between the lowest mass cluster for each age on the mass - age plane , and the fading limit .",
    "there is no such gap in figure [ fig - plots ] .    in another interpretation of cluster evolution ,",
    "clusters keep their mass for a time @xmath18 and then get disrupted suddenly , perhaps in a gmc collision . in this case , the disruption probability per unit time should decrease with time as @xmath87 to get a constant number per unit @xmath16 in fixed intervals of mass , as suggested by the distribution of points on the mass@xmath88age plane .",
    "our observations can not distinguish between these two mechanisms of physical cluster loss , i.e. , between mass loss from each cluster with cluster mass @xmath89 , or sudden cluster loss with a disruption rate @xmath89 .",
    "in both cases , the loss mechanisms have to be independent of cluster mass if the mass function has the same power law slope for all ages .",
    "the first mechanism can not be simple evaporation because evaporation gives a constant cluster loss rate , @xmath90constant for a constant cluster density ( as determined by tidal effects , for example ; baumgardt & makino 2003 ) .",

    "the discussion in  [ sb ] suggests that some individual region masses decrease with time as @xmath87 .",
    "there may be some sudden disruption of regions too , with probability @xmath95 , but we can not see that in our data ( we know nothing about when the regions that have been disrupted were disrupted ) .    a schematic model for mass loss by fading below the surface brightness limit of a survey is shown in figure [ fig - massloss_sblimit ] .",
    "the two gaussian curves represent projected profiles @xmath96 through two clusters having the same total mass .",

    "the intensity in the integral , @xmath100 is taken to be zero for the parts of the cluster below the surface brightness limit , and the actual cluster intensity @xmath96 for parts of the cluster above the surface brightness limit .",
    "the dispersion of the bright cluster is 1 on this scale , and the dispersion of the dim cluster is @xmath101 , designed to make the two clusters have the same size out to the surface brightness limit .",
    "this satisfies the constraint suggested by figure [ fig - radiusvsage ] that clusters do not appear to expand much with age .",
    "in fact , if we identify the faint cluster in figure [ fig - massloss_sblimit ] as an old cluster , then it has expanded with age , but at the same time as it has faded , leaving the apparent size at the surface brightness limit about constant .",
    "the point of figure [ fig - massloss_sblimit ] is that two clusters with the same total mass can have two different measured masses if only those parts of the cluster that are above the surface brightness limit are measured .",
    "cluster fading then automatically causes a measured mass loss over and above stellar evolution effects .",
    "this mass loss is not the same as stellar evaporation because the missing stars are still near the cluster and maybe even bound to the cluster .",

    "several of our galaxies have peaks in the number of star - forming regions as a function of time , as well as peaks in the number of massive regions and in the maximum mass of clusters . from a study of integrated h@xmath1  equivalent widths of a large sample of dwarfs , lee et al.(2007 )",
    "conclude that dwarf galaxies should experience 1 - 3 starbursts per gyr .",

    "the enhanced cluster formation episode centered on an age of 1 gyr , for example , lasted about 470 myrs .",
    "thus , the history of cluster formation in ngc 6822 has been roughly consistent with the findings of these studies",
    ". however , in 6 other systems in our sample , cluster formation appears to have been roughly constant until 950 myrs ago , with few or none formed since then .",

    "the median ages are slightly younger in ngc 6822 and ngc 2366 and slightly older in ddo 50 in the outer halves .",
    "h@xmath1 becomes invisible in the outer parts of galaxy disks even though we find normal star formation there .",
    "for ddo 210 , there is no h@xmath1 emission even though there is one region younger than 10 myr .",
    "there are many reasons why h@xmath1 should disappear when star formation continues , including a lack of massive stars due to old cluster age or a steep imf ( see , for example , pflamm - altenburg & kroupa 2009 ) , an escape of lyman continuum photons from the vicinities of the o - type stars , and a undetectable surface brightness for the ionization - bounded hii region .",
    "the age gradient explanation is difficult to reconcile with our observation of a nearly constant age with radius , and that , along with possible imf variations , are also in conflict with the observation of a normal exponential uv profile .",
    "the uv exponential implies that the onset of star formation in the outer disk is in the same proportion to the surrounding stars as in the inner disk , and in a steady state , this implies that the evolution of o - stars off the main sequence is in the same proportion too .",
    "thus the fraction of star - forming regions in each stage of evolution should be independent of radius , as should the imf , and this means that the fraction that produce h@xmath1 is constant too .",
    "an exception might occur if the outer regions had a burst of star formation at just the right time in the past to have all of the associated o - type stars now evolved off the main sequence .",
    "this is unlikely for all of the galaxies here .",
    "escape of lyman continuum radiation from the vicinity of the o - star can explain the lack of h@xmath1 whether or not those photons escape the galaxy .",
    "h@xmath1 emission disappears when the ionizing radiation from a massive star spreads out over a large volume and the emission measure becomes undetectable .",
    "considering that the quantity @xmath104 cm@xmath3 pc for an o - type star ( vacca et al .",
    "1996 ) with hii region electron density @xmath106 and radius @xmath107 , and that the density in the ambient interstellar medium should be @xmath108 @xmath109 or lower in the outer regions of most galaxies , a typical hii region radius would be @xmath110 pc and the corresponding emission measure would be @xmath111 @xmath112 pc , which is undetectable in our survey by a factor of 340 .",
    "the limit of our detection for emission measure is 5.374 pc @xmath112 ( youngblood & hunter 1999 ) , which corresponds to a minimum density of 0.41.4 @xmath109 at this ionization rate .",

    "only a few clusters have formed .",

    "the furthest star - forming regions are not incredibly massive , but high masses are not expected for single - member populations ( i.e. , furthest regions ) , according to the size of sample effect (  [ sect : sample ] ) .",
    "still , there is star formation at low average gas column densities .",
    "one possibility is that there is a large amount of cold molecular material in outer dwarf disks .",
    "galliano et al.(2003 ) find that in ngc 1569 there is a significant millimeter excess , perhaps indicating extensive cold ( 5 - 7 k ) dust that may make up 40 - 70% of the total dust mass of the galaxy . if this dust is real , then this is perhaps evidence of pervasive cold molecular material . alternatively and",
    "more likely , the star - forming regions may be at places where the _ local _ gas density is significantly higher than the average surroundings ( schaye 2004 ; elmegreen & hunter 2006 ) . the problem then is to determine the mechanism of cloud formation in sub - threshold gas .",
    "most of the far outer star - forming regions in spiral galaxies shown by thilker et al .",
    "( 2007 ) are in spiral arms .",
    "gaseous spirals can propagate much further out in a disk than stellar spirals because the gas spirals do not get absorbed at the outer lindblad resonance like the stellar spirals do .",
    "thus there is a natural explanation for cloud formation in outer spiral disks that is connected with compression from gaseous density waves .",
    "the far - outer regions in dwarf irregular galaxies are not aligned in spiral arms , however , so this explanation does not apply here .",
    "there has to be another source of compression for irregulars that is consistent with the continuation of the exponential disk .",
    "this exponential constraint would seem to rule out random extragalactic cloud impacts or minor mergers , which would trigger star formation in a more irregular way .",
    "there is also little evidence for supersonic turbulence in far - outer disks , so the compression from that would seem to be small .",
    "for example , the hi line widths in outer disks could be largely thermal at several thousand degrees kelvin , i.e. , from a nearly pure warm phase ( young & lo 1996 , young et al .",
    "2003 , de blok & walter 2006 ) .",
    "an interesting possibility is that star formation is triggered by gravitational instabilities in the outer disk , just like it is thought to be triggered in the inner disk .",
    "this can occur in subthreshold gas if the angular momentum from a growing perturbation is removed .",
    "the toomre q threshold applies only when perturbations conserve angular momentum ( elmegreen 1987 ) . with magnetic tension or viscosity that can remove angular momentum from a growing perturbation as it tries to spin up ,",
    "the disk is always unstable even at large @xmath125 .",
    "what changes is the growth time , which becomes long at large @xmath125 , in rough proportion to the viscous time or magnetic damping time ( elmegreen 1991 ; gammie 1996 ) . if the viscous and damping times are approximately equal to the crossing time through the thickness of the disk , which is true for equipartition magnetic fields and turbulent damping , then there should be no sharp transition at the @xmath126 radius .",
    "the instability growth time would increase steadily with radius in proportion to the disk thickness crossing time , and this would always give some level of instability for cloud formation .",
    "previous observations of a threshold , based on a drop in h@xmath1 emission , would then be an artifact of low emission measure and lyman continuum photon escape , as discussed above .",
    "large samples of star - forming regions are more likely to contain rare massive members than are small samples",
    ". this should be true for any subsample of a collection too .",
    "if the mass distribution function of star - forming regions is @xmath127 , which is usually the case , then the mass of the most - massive region should increase linearly with the number of regions .",
    "previous discussions in this paper illustrated numerous examples of this size - of - sample effect .",
    "figures [ fig - radnmaxmass ] and [ fig - radnmaxmass2 ] show two results related to the size of sample effect : a trend in the maximum mass of a star - forming region in a radial interval versus the surface density of regions ( fig .",
    "[ fig - radnmaxmass ] ) and a trend versus the total number of regions ( fig .",
    "[ fig - radnmaxmass2 ] ) in that interval . in both cases , there is a positive correlation such that the most massive regions are also where the surface density and total count are highest , which tends to be the inner part of a galaxy .",
    "the clearest correlations have a slope of about unity .",
    "this figure illustrates an effect where the star - forming regions in the outer part of a galaxy tend to be lower mass than those in the inner part , not because of a physical change with radius , but because the total count of regions in the outer part is smaller .",
    "we are also interested in whether the size - of - sample effect applies when comparing one galaxy to another .",
    "figure [ fig - nmx ] shows the maximum region mass plotted as a function of the total number of regions extrapolated down to a mass of @xmath128 , which is the lowest observable minimum mass for all of our galaxies .",
    "if the observable minimum @xmath129 for a particular galaxy is higher than this , then the extrapolated count is taken to equal the count higher than @xmath130 multiplied by the ratio @xmath131 .",
    "this would be the extrapolated count in the case when the mass function is @xmath132 .",
    "the figure shows a nice correlation with a slope of unity , as expected for the size - of - sample effect .",
    "thus galaxies with more massive star - forming regions are the ones with more total regions ( e.g. billett , hunter , & elmegreen , 2002 ; whitmore 2003 ) .",
    "the galaxies have these massive regions only because the star - formation process is able to sample further into the tail of the region mass distribution function .",
    "this result implies that star formation operates with universal physical processes that are stochastic in nature .",
    "of course , the specific region masses are determined by these processes , but the mixture of possibilities is so large that the mass distribution function is essentially random when it is observed as an ensemble .",
    "the one exception in our study seems to be the super star cluster in ngc 2366 , which is relatively unaccompanied by lower mass clusters (  [ sect:2366 ] ) .",
    "this giant cluster could either have been formed by a completely different process , one that does not give the same @xmath133 mass distribution function as the main process , or it could have grown to its current mass by coagulation of lower - mass clusters .",
    "models of cluster coalescence are in elmegreen et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and fellhauer & kroupa ( 2002 ) .",
    "with the small size of dwarf galaxies comes low surface brightnesses and low densities . yet despite these apparent impediments to star formation , we see dwarf galaxies actively forming stars , sometimes in dramatic starbursts .",
    "we also see star formation in the far outer parts of dwarf galaxies , where the conditions are even more extreme . here",
    "we identified star - forming regions in nearby dwarf galaxies on uv images in order to study their properties as a function of galactocentric radius and from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "we measured the ages and masses of the more prominent star - forming regions in 11 nearby dim galaxies .",
    "we were able to define 1623 useable regions on _ galex _",
    "@xmath11 images .",
    "we see star forming regions that run the gambit from tens to millions of solar masses , and we were able to find regions as young as our lower limit of several million years to our completeness limit of 500 myrs . within our sample of galaxies we see stark differences from one to the next . for example",
    ", our closest galaxy has at least 713 star - forming regions , while our next closest galaxy has only 5 .",
    "still , for all of our galaxies , the maximum region mass scales linearly with the total number of regions , and within each galaxy , the maximum mass in a radial annulus scales linearly with the local number in that annulus .",
    "both trends indicate that star formation mass is independent of local environment and even the surrounding galaxy mass , but is given by random sampling from a universal mass function that is of the usual form @xmath127 .",
    "we find that our galaxies fall into three categories describing cluster formation activity over the past 500 myrs : star formation with gaps , nearly constant star formation , and little - to - no star formation .",
    "the cases with gaps include some with occasional spikes in the star formation rate , and others with a cessation of star formation in the last 10 to 25 myr",
    ".    there is no consistent , measurable radial dependence for ages and masses of star - forming regions .",
    "the exceptions , ddo 50 and ngc 2366 , show a trend towards lower masses at greater radii , but even there we see massive regions on the edges of the optical galaxies . generally there is no indication that dwarf irregular galaxies are less capable of producing massive star - forming regions in their outer disks than in their inner disks .",
    "still , the regions in the outer disk often have no discernable h@xmath1 emission .",
    "this is presumably the result of the low density there , which makes h@xmath1 in the vicinity of massive stars very difficult to observe .",
    "these little galaxies have in the past presented many quandaries as to how something so small and sparse can form stars , and now it looks like they are forming stars in areas even more extreme than was previously believed possible from other surveys .",
    "this is consistent with a picture in which localized processes form stars in most regions of dwarf galaxies . at locations where the average gas surface density is much smaller ( @xmath134 ) than the fiducial critical value",
    ", we still see star formation .",
    "the detailed reasons for this are unknown .",
    "there are no spiral distributions for this star formation as there are in the outer parts of large spiral galaxies , so we can not identify spiral wave compression as a primary cloud formation mechanism .",
    "it could be that all of the outer galaxy star formation and much of what happens in the inner region too , is triggered locally , by stray supernova , for example , or by the turbulence that supernovae and other energy sources drive .",
    "it could also be that large - scale gravitational instabilities operate everywhere , even in sub - threshold gas , because of an easy transfer of angular momentum away from growing density perturbations . in that case",
    ", the collapse rate could be smaller than the local dynamical rate , more like the angular momentum loss rate , but the final result for the scale and properties of star formation could be the same .",
    "high resolution observations of the gas in these regions should clarify this picture .",
    "the star forming regions in our survey also offer some insight into the evolution of measureable mass with age .",
    "the distribution of regions on a @xmath135 versus @xmath16 diagram is somewhat uniform over age @xmath18 for equal intervals of mass @xmath17 .",
    "this uniformity suggests that the regions are being removed from our view systematically with age .",
    "this loss is consistent with a model in which each individual region mass is decreasing as @xmath87 .",
    "it is also consistent with another model in which each region mass is constant until that region is suddenly disrupted , and the disruption probability is proportional to @xmath87 .",
    "both possibilities could happen simultaneously too .",
    "we can not say anything about the regions that have been disrupted , but we note from a trend in the age dependence of surface brightness that measured masses may in fact be decreasing as @xmath87 .",
    "this result is illustrated most clearly in a diagram of fading - corrected absolute magnitude versus the log of the age .",
    "a correlation in this diagram has a slope consistent with @xmath91 .",
    "the implication is that the outer parts of star - forming regions are getting lost from our view as they slip below the surface brightness limit of the survey .",
    "this is a loss of mass over and above stellar evolutionary effects ( supernovae and winds ) and in addition to evaporation .",
    "we are investigating all of these mass loss processes in more detail in a second paper .",

    "we discuss the properties of the ensemble of regions in each galaxy .",
    "ngc 6822 is the closest galaxy in our survey ( 0.5 mpc ) .",
    "because of this , we were able to identify 800 individual star - forming regions , 713 of which made it into our final data set . with this galaxy",
    "we were able to trace the star forming regions to much lower luminosity levels than in any other galaxy .",
    "a problem arises because of the galaxy s large angular size ( about 15@xmath13615 ) , which led to field star contamination at this low galactic latitude .",
    "ngc 6822 has star - forming regions ranging in mass from 15 @xmath120 to @xmath137 , and ranging in age from several myrs to well beyond the 500 myrs that is emphasized in the uv .",
    "the lower mass limit of a star - forming region that should still be visible after 500 myrs is @xmath138 in this galaxy . figure [ fig - numvsage ] suggests that star formation has occurred in two or three major episodes .",
    "these episodes appear as peaks in the number of all clusters detected and in the number of clusters detected with masses larger than our adopted lower mass limit .",
    "they also appear as peaks in the mass of the most massive cluster as a function of age .",
    "the episodes occur for logarithmic ages between the present and 7.5 , between 8.12 and 8.78 , and after 9.28 .",
    "we refer to these as the 7 myr , 100 myr , and 1 gyr bursts .    in the most recent star formation event at 7 myr",
    ", there are 3 clusters more massive than @xmath139 .",
    "the most massive cluster in this event is @xmath140 . in the event at 100 myr , there are 7 regions of mass @xmath141 , with the most massive of these having a mass of @xmath142 . in the older burst at 1gyr , which may not be complete in time and",
    "is certainly not complete to our adopted lower mass limit , we see 54 regions of mass @xmath143 , with the most massive having a mass of @xmath144 . the oldest age burst is old enough that all of the clusters below @xmath138 have faded , and we see this in the lower mass limit of the regions we identified .",
    "we can estimate the apparent relative formation rates of star - forming regions from the counts of regions on the time axis .",
    "for the 7 and 100 myr bursts , the apparent region formation rates with @xmath145 , obtained from the counts per unit time interval , are 0.1 and 0.01 massive regions per myr , respectively .",
    "these are the apparent and not the real formation rates because many clusters have been lost from their original mass intervals through disruption and evaporation .    for a mass function of the form @xmath127",
    ", the total number of initial regions should be equal to the ratio of the maximum region mass to the minimum region mass .",
    "this is one aspect of the size - of - sample effect .",
    "if we consider a minimum detectable mass to be @xmath139 , then the number of regions above this mass should be proportional to the maximum region mass if the disruption probability is independent of mass ( e.g. , as observed by chandar et al .",
    "2009 ) . from the pure counts of clusters above @xmath139 ,",
    "the proportion in the two most recent bursts is 1:2.3 , and from the maximum masses , the proportion is 1:3.5 .",
    "these proportions are close enough to each other to agree with the predictions of the size of sample effect , considering the small numbers of massive clusters .",
    "( fractional errors in the counts are 60% and 38% , respectively , from the inverse square roots of the number of massive regions ) .",
    "fall et al .",
    "( 2005 ) consider the mass - age diagram for the antenna galaxy and note that generally the number of clusters above a certain mass in equal log intervals of time is about constant with time , which means that the number of clusters remaining per unit age interval decreases as @xmath7 . in our sequence of ages ,",
    "the counts per unit time , 0.1 and 0.01 regions myr@xmath146 are indeed roughly proportional to the inverse of their ages ( 7 and 100 myr ) .",
    "this implies that clusters of all masses are becoming increasing lost over time",
    ". such loss could be from a combination of the two processes as discussed in ",
    "[ sect : destroy ] , and from the surface brightness effects discussed in  [ sb ] .    from @xmath147 to @xmath148 and from @xmath149 to @xmath150 , periods of 46 myr and 1300 myr",
    ", there are lulls in the star formation rate . in the first interval , no regions of @xmath151 form and the maximum mass drops down to @xmath152 . in the second interval , no regions were formed as massive as the periods on either side , but the maximum mass is @xmath153 . in the bursts before and after these lulls , the maximum cluster masses were higher by factors of @xmath154 and the total numbers of clusters remaining were higher by factors of @xmath155 .",
    "thus we are seeing oscillations in the cluster formation rate by a factor of order @xmath156 in both the cluster counts and the maximum cluster mass .",
    "this type of variation is consistent with lee et al.s ( 2007 ) prediction .",
    "the time intervals of the peaks and lulls decrease toward the present time .",
    "this appears to be the result of star formation with a clustered or hierarchical structure in time ( for models of such star formation , see elmegreen & scalo 2006 ) .",
    "cluster bursts of short duration that occurred long ago would appear blended in time because our time resolution can not resolve the small subbursts , while cluster bursts of the same intrinsic width that occurred recently can still be resolved .",
    "the time resolution increases in proportion to a power of the cluster age because the cluster colors evolve with a power law time dependence .",
    "figures [ fig - plots ] and [ fig - numvsage ] suggest that the recent formation of massive regions in ngc 6822 is more prominent in the outer part of the disk , beyond @xmath60 .",
    "the left - hand part of figure [ fig - numvsage ] also suggests that most of the young regions , regardless of mass , are outside @xmath60 .",
    "in fact 468 of this galaxy s 713 star - forming regions fall outside of @xmath60 , which is far more than we see in any other galaxy in our survey .",

    "the h@xmath1  only extends to a radius of 7.5  from the center of the galaxy , and we see star - forming regions in the uv out to a radius of 9.3 .",
    "there are far more massive regions inside @xmath60 than outside .",
    "the clusters beyond @xmath60  tend to be lower mass with a few notable exceptions among the oldest identified clusters .",

    "ddo 50 was the second most distant galaxy in our survey at 3.4 mpc , but we were still able to define 169 regions , 139 of which made it into the final data set .",

    "because h@xmath1  extends nearly as far as star formation seen in the uv ( 4.1  for h@xmath1  and 5.1  for the uv ) , we found only 10 regions beyond @xmath60 .",

    "one of the unusual characteristics of this galaxy is that its azimuthally - averaged @xmath37-band and 4.5-micron surface brightness profiles do not fall off at a constant exponential rate .",
    "instead , we see a flat profile in the inner 1.8  radius ( 0.7 kpc ) , followed by a normal exponential decay curve beyond that ( hunter & elmegreen 2006 ) . to investigate whether the break in the profile represents a change in star formation characteristics , we compare the regions interior and exterior to the break in figure [ fig - d75 ] .",

    "do we see a significant change in the star - formation characteristics at the surface brightness break .",
    "there is a peak in the surface density of star - forming regions at the break , but no obvious change in region properties .",

    "the cluster mass function is apparently flatter in ngc 2366 , or more concentrated in its most massive two clusters .",

    "<S> the regions are identified on _ galex _ near - uv images , and modeled with uv , optical , and near - ir colors to determine masses and ages . </S>",
    "<S> a few galaxies have made @xmath0 complexes in a starburst phase , while others have not formed clusters in the last 50 myrs . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum region mass correlates with the number of regions as expected from the size - of - sample effect . </S>",
    "<S> we find no radial gradients in region masses and ages , even beyond the realm of h@xmath1 emission , although there is an exponential decrease in the luminosity density and number density of the regions with radius . </S>",
    "<S> h@xmath1 is apparently lacking in the outer parts only because nebular emission around massive stars is too faint to see . </S>",
    "<S> the outermost regions for the 5 galaxies with hi data formed at average gas surface densities of 1.9 - 5.9 @xmath2pc@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> these densities are at the low end of commonly - considered thresholds for star formation and imply either that _ local _ gas densities are higher before star formation begins or sub - threshold star formation is possible . </S>",
    "<S> the first case could be explained by supernovae triggering and other local processes , while the second case could be explained by gravitational instabilities with angular momentum loss in growing condensations . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of regions on a @xmath4 plot is examined . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution is usually uniform along @xmath5 for equal intervals of @xmath6 and this implies a region count that varies as @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> this variation results from either an individual region mass that varies as @xmath7 or a region disruption probability that varies as @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> a correlation between fading - corrected surface brightness and age suggests the former . the implied loss of mass is from fading of region envelopes below the surface brightness limit </S>"
