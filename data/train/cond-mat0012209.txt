    "mixed spin chains with alternating spins ( 1,1/2 ) are paradigmatic examples of strongly correlated systems exhibiting excitations of different types , namely , both gapless and gapped excitations in the low energy spectrum @xcite .",
    "this is a manifestation of their ferrimagnetic character and they are responsible for their unusual properties . on the contrary , one - dimensional integer - spin anti - ferromagnetic heisenberg ( afh ) model",
    "has a unique disordered ground state with a finite excitation gap while the half - integer spin afh chain is gapless @xcite .",
    "these ferrimagnetic quantum chains have recently attracted much attention and several techniques have been devoted to their study : analytically , such as spin wave theory ( swt ) @xcite , quantum renormalization group @xcite , variational @xcite , and numerically , such as conventional @xcite , transfer matrix dmrg @xcite , qmc @xcite etc ... moreover , the interest is increased due to the fact that experimental realizations of these one - dimensional ferrimagnets also exist .",
    "for instance , the oxamato compound @xmath4 exhibits a structure of a @xmath0 ferrimagnetic chain @xcite where the spins 1 are located at the ni sites and the spins 1/2 at the cu sites .",
    "it is found that below @xmath5 it exhibits long range order ( lro ) .",
    "materials realizing other magnitudes of spins @xmath6 have been also synthesized @xcite . in all these compounds it is assumed that the interchain coupling is much smaller than the intra - chain interactions so that the system becomes a set of effectively uncoupled quantum chains .    on the other hand , many interesting investigations have been devoted to spin ladders .",
    "they consist of coupled one - dimensional chains and may be regarded as interpolating one- and two - dimensional systems .",
    "theoretical studies have suggested two different universality class for the uniform spin ladders , i.e. the anti - ferromagnetic spin-@xmath7 ladders are gapful or gapless , depending on whether @xmath8 ( the number of legs ) is even or odd @xcite .",
    "some experimental observations are in agreement with this results @xcite",
    ". however mixed - spin ladders may change this universality .",
    "in a recent work @xcite we have considered a ferrimagnetic 2-leg ladder and conjectured its phase diagram by using an approximate quantum rg analysis .",
    "we have shown that for the homogeneous antiferromagnetic couplings the model is gapless but an energy gap may appear in a specific type of configuration of the coupling constants .    in this work we present the results of an extensive numerical analysis using the lanczos method @xcite applied to a large class of ferrimagnetic 2-leg ladders for the first time ( see @xcite for a review on ladder materials . )",
    "apart from accurate numerical results which show the effect of inter - chain interaction in a ferrimagnetic system , we obtain the phase diagram of ref.@xcite with more accuracy . in the present phase diagram , which is obtained by lanczos results ,",
    "we specify the phase boundary between the gapless and gapful phases more accurately and show that the transition between two gapless phases appears at zero inter - chain coupling and is first - order .",
    "an analytic spin wave theory is also introduced to describe the low - energy excitations of this model .",
    "moreover we will consider the effect of bond - alternation on the spin - peierls instability and its conditional or unconditional character .",
    "the model we have considered here , depicted in fig.1 , can be assumed as the first step to consider the inter - chain interactions in a ferrimagnetic material .",
    "( for instance , @xmath9 has such kind of structure @xcite . ) in our model mixed spins have lengths @xmath10 and @xmath11 and are located at alternating positions in this bipartite lattice , making up the sub - lattices a and b , respectively .",
    "one may think of two ( @xmath12 ) ferrimagnetic chains which interact via rungs in a ladder realization where different kind of spins are located on each rung ( see fig.[fig0 ] ) .",

    "we consider two different dimerization patterns : i ) cba ( columnar bond alternation , fig.[fig0](a ) ) for which @xmath24 @xcite , and ii ) sba ( staggered bond alternation , fig.[fig0](b ) ) where @xmath25 @xcite . in order to keep the system always in the antiferromagnetic regime ,",

    "we finally present our conclusions in sec .",
    "in this section we shall perform a mean - field treatment of the ferrimagnetic ladders and for simplicity we shall concentrate on the case of zero dimerization @xmath29 .",
    "the application of the lieb - mattis theorem @xcite to this ferrimagnetic ladder predicts the existence of a ground state ( gs ) with total spin @xmath31 given by @xmath32 .",
    "this leads to the existence of a non - vanishing value of the magnetization at zero temperature .",
    "then , a natural issue arises , namely , the study of classical ferrimagnetic order v.s . quantum antiferromagnetic fluctuations @xcite .",
    "this system presents gapless ferromagnetic excitations ( goldstone modes due to broken symmetry ) with spin @xmath33 and gapped antiferromagnetic excitations with spin @xmath34 .    thus , as we expect an ordered ground state , it is natural to perform a spin wave theory analysis to describe the low energy quantum fluctuations around a classical ferrimagnetic ground state .",

    "[ fig1 ] ( a ) ) we reproduce the 1d - chain result .",
    "as the interaction is switched on , we appreciate the splitting of each zero - coupling branch into another two new branches in the case of ladder .",

    "we define the gap as latexmath:[$g_1\\equiv    vanishing @xmath2 as can be seen in fig.[fig2 ] .",

    ". moreover it can be shown that the @xmath62 modes are created by acting on the classical ferrimagnetic ordered state ( @xmath63 ) with @xmath64 , where @xmath65 .",
    "the outcomes of this operation are those states which have @xmath66 .",
    "these states are annihilated by @xmath67 .",
    "therefore we conclude that these states have @xmath68 which is another sign for the ferromagnetic behaviour of @xmath58 modes .",
    "the magnetization of @xmath10 sub - lattice shown in fig.([fig4 ] ) verifies the reduction of magnetization from its classical value ( @xmath69 ) which shows that the quantum fluctuations of the lowest branch has a ferromagnetic property .",
    "similarly , the @xmath60 modes are created by acting on @xmath63 with @xmath70 , where @xmath65 .",
    "it is also possible to show that those states have @xmath71 which is the property of an anti - ferromagnetic excitations , i.e. the excited states have larger spin than the ground state .",
    "all of these explanations for the excited states are examined for a finite system size ( @xmath72 ) by lanczos method where we will discuss them in the next section .    using the quantities @xmath73 and eqs .",
    "( [ 2])-([7 ] ) , we have also computed the gs energy per site @xmath74 as follows ,    @xmath75    it is plotted as a function of @xmath2 in fig.[fig2 ] .    in a similar way",
    "the sub - lattice magnetization @xmath76 as a function of the couplings is calculated , @xmath77 the other sub - lattice magnetization @xmath78 can also be obtained by using the identity : @xmath79 .",

    "[ fig2 ] we plot the variation with @xmath2 of the gs energy and we find that the extrapolated numerical results agree very well with the swt results in the whole range .",
    "however , for the antiferromagnetic gap ( see inset of fig.[fig2 ] ) we find clear numerical differences with swt . for comparison ,",
    "we have plotted the two gaps , @xmath90 introduced before , because for the strong coupling region around @xmath91 , both gaps turn out to be very close to each other .",
    "we clearly find that the exact gap obtained with lanczos is well above the values obtained with the swt approximation .",
    "likewise , we have computed several sub - lattice magnetization and in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we show @xmath92 for the spin-1 case at site @xmath93 and we have checked that it is the same at all other positions due to translational invariance .",
    "we find that the swt calculation essentially underestimates the lanczos result . the discrepancies between swt results for energy gap ( inset of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) and magnetization ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) means that the linear swt does not provide us with a complete account of quantum fluctuations around the classical ferrimagnetic order .",
    "however the ground state energy obtained by both methods are in good agreement .",
    "for instance in the homogeneous case ( @xmath94 ) the swt result is @xmath95 which has only @xmath96 percent error with respect to lanczos result ( table.1 ) .",
    "we have also studied the effect of dimerization in the ferrimagnetic 2-leg ladder in the columnar ( cba ) and staggered ( sba ) configurations . in fig.[fig5 ] we present the results of lanczos calculations for @xmath97 and varying the staggering parameter @xmath1 in the whole range .",
    "we first check that our results are well converged for the sizes considered ( n=8,12,16,20 ) .",
    "the ground state energy converges to the value of thermodynamic limit as rapid as in the one - dimensional ferrimagnets .",
    "it means that the finite size effects are small in the ferrimagnetic ladders as well as in 1-d models .",
    "we then observe that the effect of dimerization ( @xmath1 ) is generically to decrease the gs energy and that the columnar configuration produces a bigger energy decrease than the staggered pattern .",

    "we find that the af - gap remains finite in the thermodynamic limit , moreover the interchain coupling @xmath2 increases the gap both with or without dimerization .",

    "this signals that the correlation length is bigger in the ferrimagnetic ladder than in the corresponding chain : @xmath123 .",

    "we have performed this analysis for both antiferromagnetic couplings @xmath126 and ferromagnetic couplings @xmath127 ( in units of @xmath81 ) .",
    "moreover , we have studied both dimerization patterns , cba and sba , considered throughout this work .    in order to set up this phase diagram",
    "we determine numerically the existence or lack of an energy gap in the lowest lying spectrum , as we have done in previous sections . for antiferromagnetic @xmath2",
    "we find gapless ferrimagnetic order for both cba and sba configurations .",
    "this ferrimagnetic order is supported by a non - zero value of magnetization .",
    "this is in agreement with the approximate qrg analysis in @xcite , and thus we do not explicitly plot this diagram .",
    "the most interesting characteristics are found in the ferromagnetic @xmath2 region . in this case , we find that the gs is a spin singlet while the lowest excitation is a spin triplet . for the sba dimerization pattern",
    "we always find a gapless behaviour for any value of the dimerization parameter @xmath1 .",
    "since the ground state is a singlet the magnetization is zero for all @xmath127 region .",
    "thus we conclude that the phase boundary between the two gapless phases ( @xmath127 and @xmath126 ) is at @xmath52 where a first - order phase transition occurs .",
    "if we consider the magnetization as the order parameter then it is discontinuous at @xmath52 ( 1-st order transition ) .",
    "the @xmath52 transition line modifies the location of phase boundary obtained by qrg in the previous study ( see fig.3 in ref.@xcite ) .    however , the situation turns richer for the cba dimerization and this is the case that we plot in fig.[fig9 ] .    to obtain this numerical phase diagram",

    "we extrapolate the value of the energy gap for infinite lattices and draw a symbols @xmath133 if the gap is non - vanishing and a symbol @xmath134 otherwise .",
    "these extensive lanczos analysis is presented in fig.[fig9 ] .    here",
    "we find two phases depending on whether we are in a strong or weak dimerization regime , assuming also that the interchain coupling @xmath2 is not negligible .",
    "we clearly detect a gapful phase in the upper part of the diagram and a gapless phase in the lower part . from our numerical data",
    "we also estimate the phase separating line plotted as a dashed line in fig.[fig9 ] and we observe that it approaches a horizontal asymptote as the interchain coupling becomes very large . as it has been mentioned before the whole @xmath127 region has zero magnetization due to the spin of ground state which is @xmath135 .",
    "so the phase boundary between the two gapless phases ( @xmath127 and @xmath126 ) is at @xmath52 accompanying a first - order transition similar to sba configuration .",
    "we have also carried out a lanczos study of the spin - peierls ( sp ) instability .",
    "this phenomena has been realized in several materials and here we anticipate this possibility in the ferrimagnetic 2-leg ladders .",
    "this transition towards a dimerised gs ferrimagnetic ladder is determined by the competition between the lowering of the magnetic energy due to dimerization and the raising of the elastic energy due to phonons . according to standard terminology",
    ", the transition is called unconditional if the ground state is dimerised for arbitrary large value of the spin - phonon coupling ( or small value of dimerization ) , and it is called conditional otherwise .    using exact diagonalization techniques it has been possible to stablish @xcite that integer spin chains do not have a spin - peierls transition while half - integer spin chains does exhibit this transition .",
    "this behaviour was predicted by schulz @xcite using bosonization techniques .",
    "however , other analytical studies had contradicted this conclusion @xcite .",

    "gapless behaviour .",
    "moreover , it is very interesting to study the sp transition for _ quasi_-1d systems as a function of the interchain coupling @xmath2 .",
    "this is usually done within the so called chain mean - field theory which underestimates the effect of this coupling . here",
    "we can treat its effect without any bias .",

    "it can be shown that studying the limit of ( [ 10 ] ) as @xmath139 for small @xmath1 reveals the conditional or unconditional character of the sp transition .",
    "specifically , this feature is encoded in the concavity or convexity character , respectively , of the curve of ( [ 10 ] ) v.s .",
    "@xmath140 @xcite .",
    "namely , for a finite system the condition for having an unconditional dimerised transition is that in the limit of small @xmath1 , the energy gain ( [ 10 ] ) must strictly increase as @xmath101 increases .",
    "this means that the stabilization energy always overcomes the elastic energy . otherwise ,",
    "if the magnetic energy gain does not strictly increase with increasing the size , then the transition is conditional , i.e .",
    ", it depends on the stiffness of the lattice .",
    "this characterization of the conditional v.s .",
    "unconditional character of the dimerization transition can be recasted in terms of the geometry of the curve for the energy magnetic gain ( [ 10 ] ) as a function of the size @xmath140 : when the transition is unconditional the curvature of this function is oriented upwards with respect to the @xmath141 axis and we call this a convex curve ( see fig.1(a ) ) in @xcite ) ; while in case of the conditional transition , the curvature is oriented downwards with respect to the horizontal axis and we call this a concave curve ( see fig.1(b ) in @xcite . ) in figs .",
    "[ fig8 ] we present our results .",
    "we observe that these curves are clearly concave for any values of the @xmath2 couplings that we have investigated .",
    "moreover , this result holds true for both cba and sba configurations .",
    "thus , we find that the sp transition is conditional for a set of values in @xmath2 ranging from @xmath142 to @xmath143 . we have presented a reduced number of plots for the variation of @xmath2 in fig.[fig8 ] because for larger values the curves have a different scale and can not be fitted into one plot .",
    "we have checked this by taking three different value of @xmath1 ( @xmath144 ) .",
    "it has been also shown that the magnetic energy gain in cba is bigger than in the sba configuration which is in agreement with fig.([fig5 ] ) where the cba configuration is more stable than the sba one against small perturbations .",
    "this paper represents the first extensive numerical study using the lanczos method of quantum ferrimagnetism in quasi - one dimensional models with a ladder structure .",
    "previous numerical works have dwell upon truly one dimensional spin chains with alternating spins of magnitude @xmath0 .",
    "we have presented our results regarding ground state properties of a 2-leg ladder with two patterns of dimerization : columnar ( cba ) and staggered(sba ) .",
    "likewise , we have seen how the gs properties evolve upon variation of the interchain coupling constant @xmath2 of the ladder .    among the properties",
    "we have computed we mention the ground state energy , antiferromagnetic gap , gapless behaviour of the ferromagnetic excitations as we extrapolate our results to the thermodynamic limit , gs correlation functions and so on and so forth .",
    "these results have been contrasted with an approximate spin wave theory analysis in the linear approximation and found a qualitative good agreement in some properties like the ground state energy , but not for the gaps .",
    "moreover , we have performed a numerical analysis of when a spin - peierls transition can occur and we have reported that this transition is conditional .    we have completed our lanczos study of 2-leg mixed spin ladders with the inclusion of a numerical phase diagram which allows us to clarify the different gapless or gapful phases in the space of couplings of the model .",
