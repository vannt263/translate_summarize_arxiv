    "the evolution of galaxy clustering provides vital clues to the formation of galaxies and large - scale structure .",
    "the amplitude of galaxy clustering is determined by the combination of the evolution of the underlying mass fluctuations , and the bias relating the galaxy overdensities to mass .",
    "observationally the amplitude of the galaxy correlation function has been measured from redshift surveys extending up to redshifts @xmath11 ( e.g. cfrs , le fevre et al . , 1995 ; cnoc2 , carlberg et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the discovery of lyman break galaxies ( steidel et al . , 1996 ) has allowed the scientific community to push this limit even further up to @xmath12 .",
    "however there is still a gap between the measurements obtained for @xmath13 and those provided by the analysis of the lyman break galaxies at redshifts @xmath14 .",
    "the aim of this letter is to `` fill in '' this gap by presenting measurements of the correlation function obtained from the catalogue of photometric redshifts derived from the hubble deep field by fernandez - soto et al . , 1998 .",
    "using the photometric redshifts we divide the catalogue into subsamples in redshift and measure the angular correlation function @xmath1 and its amplitude as a function of @xmath15 up to @xmath16 . at low redshift",
    "our results agree with the results of connolly et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , and at higher redshifts they are consistent with lyman break galaxies .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : section 2 gives a description of the catalogue adopted for our analysis while section 3 presents the results for the angular correlation function . in section 4",
    "we derive the meaningful spatial quantities as a function of redshift , while section 5 summarises our conclusions .",
    "the hubble deep field ( hdf ) image ( williams et al . , 1996 ) covers an l - shaped area roughly @xmath17 , with a total area @xmath18arcmin@xmath19 and provides us with the deepest view of the universe obtained so far .",
    "the image was obtained by the hubble space telescope using the wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) over a period of 10 consecutive days .",
    "the same image was acquired by using the broad - band filters f300w , f450w , f60w and f814w in order to allow for the possibility of assigning photometric redshifts to the objects in the field .",
    "since then various techniques for getting photometric redshifts have been applied to the hdf ( see e.g. connolly et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "the catalogue we will use for this work has been derived by fernandez - soto et al . , 1998 by incorporating in their former technique ( lanzetta et al . , 1996 ) the infrared images of the hdf acquired in the j(1.2@xmath20 m ) , h(1.65@xmath20 m ) and k(2.2@xmath20 m ) broad - band filters ( dickinson et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "their final catalogue includes 1067 objects , some of them at very high redshifts ( @xmath21 ) , as seen in the redshift distribution shown in figure [ fig : n_z ] .",
    "the edges of the wide field camera images are of poorer quality than the bulk of the images , and fernandez - soto et al .",
    "use a magnitude limit of ab(8140)=28 for the inner part of the hdf , while the outer part of the image includes only objects with ab(8140)@xmath2226 . using the sensitivity map given in fernandez - soto et al .",
    ", 1998 we rejected all those galaxies belonging to the shallower region ; our final version of the catalogue , complete down to the magnitude ab(8140)=28 , includes 946 objects .",
    "figure  1 shows the distribution of galaxies in the catalogue split into a series of narrow redshift intervals .",
    "correlation - function analysis has become the standard way to quantify the clustering of different populations of astronomical sources .",
    "ideally we would like to measure the spatial correlation function , but photometric redshifts are not precise enough to enable a direct measurement : the typical error between the photometric estimates and the spectroscopic measurements of @xmath15 is @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) ( see fernandez - soto et al . , 1998 ) , so that for instance @xmath25 at @xmath14 , corresponding to several hundred mpc .",
    "nevertheless the estimated redshifts can be used to select subsamples of galaxies at different redshifts , and so we can obtain estimates of the spatial clustering as a function of redshift via the angular correlation function . as pointed out by connolly at al ( 1998 ) ,",
    "the angular correlation function from a redshift limited sample has much higher signal - to - noise than a comparable magnitude limited sample .",
    "the angular two - point correlation function @xmath1 gives the excess probability , with respect to a random poisson distribution , of finding two sources in the solid angles @xmath26 @xmath27 separated by an angle @xmath28 , and it is defined as @xmath29 \\label{eqn : wthetadef } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the mean number density of objects in the catalogue under consideration .",
    "one of the major limitations on the study of large - scale structure with the hdf is its small field of view ; for @xmath9 , 220 arcsecs correspond to 0.9@xmath31 mpc at @xmath32 , ( see connolly et al . ,",
    "1998 ) , so isolating narrow redshift intervals will select galaxies in a small volume , and so lead to very large errors in the clustering analysis ( e.g. a single cluster of galaxies could dominate the signal ) .",
    "we therefore decided to divide the sample into bins of width @xmath0 and consider for our analysis all the objects in the `` clean '' catalogue ( see section 2 ) up to redshifts @xmath33 .",
    "this redshift bin width corresponds to between one and two times the expected _ rms _ error in the redshifts .",
    "given the small number of galaxies in the catalogue it might be thought that the signal - to - noise could be improved by using broader bins to increase the number of objects per bin and so reduce the poisson noise .",
    "however , increasing the redshift range in each bin would lead to a noticeable reduction of the clustering signal due to the `` washing out '' of real structures caused by projection effects . as we will see later ,",
    "cosmic variance is not a problem in our analysis .",
    "in fact , the presence of an overdense ( underdense ) region in the sample would result in a sudden rise ( fall ) of the clustering amplitude only in one particular redshift bin .",
    "the smooth trend of the correlation length @xmath3 as a function of @xmath15 ( see figure 4 ) suggests this is not the case in our analysis .",
    "we then generated random catalogues containing 10000 galaxies , with positions of the random objects lying within the area defined by the geometry of the photometric data , for each of the subsamples associated to a particular redshift bin and then counted the number of distinct data - data pairs ( @xmath34 ) , data - random pairs ( @xmath35 , and distinct random - random pairs ( @xmath36 ) as a function of angular separation . we then calculate @xmath37 using the estimator ( hamilton , 1993 ) @xmath38 in the angular scales @xmath39 arcsecs .",
    "we also used the estimators suggested by peebles ( 1980 ) and landy & szalay ( 1993 ) , and found virtually identical results . in figure",
    "[ fig : w ] we show the results for @xmath37 for different redshift bins ; the error bars show poisson estimates for the points .",
    "since the distribution is clustered , these estimates only provide a lower limit to the uncertainties .",
    "nevertheless it can be shown that , over the range of scales considered for the calculation of @xmath1 , poisson errors are comparable to those obtained from bootstrap resampling ( villumsen et al . , 1997 , see also connolly et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "note that in our analysis we did not include the results for @xmath40 ; this is due to the fact that the effect of excluding bright ( nearby ) galaxies in the construction of the hdf sample results in a spurious reduction of the clustering amplitude in that redshift range ( connolly et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : w ] the angular correlation function is significantly positive at small scales for all the redshift bins considered in our analysis .",
    "the clustering amplitude is roughly constant within the errors up to @xmath41 ; above this value the amplitude increases , and remains high for all @xmath42 samples .",
    "the apparent clustering in the higher redshift samples may be partly affected by the problem of defining single galaxies from the irregular morphology of some of the objects . however , this is a problem only for scales smaller than @xmath43 , and we can see from visual inspection of the distribution of sources in figure  [ fig : dist ] that there are several clumps covering 10 - 20 arcsec in each sample ; it is these that generate the high clustering amplitude . to make sure the signal was not spurious , caused for example by difficulties in identifying single galaxies from complex irregular galaxies",
    ", we visually inspected the objects in each of these clumps .",
    "the individual galaxies appeared well separated and certainly not parts of single irregular objects .",
    "we conclude that the measurements represent real galaxy clustering .",
    "if we assume a power - law form for @xmath44 , we can estimate the parameters @xmath45 and @xmath46 , using a least - squares fit to the data . given the large errors on @xmath37 we assumed a fixed value of @xmath8 .",
    "the small area of the hdf catalogue introduces a negative bias through the integral constraint , @xmath47 .",
    "we allow for this by fitting to @xmath48 , where @xmath49 , furthermore , even though @xmath1 has been measured up to @xmath50 , only angular scales less than half the sample size are likely to be reliable ( see also connolly et al . , 1998 ) , so we limit the fit to @xmath51 .",
    "the dashed lines in figure [ fig : w ] represent the best fit for each redshift interval ; the best values for the amplitude @xmath45 as a function of redshift are listed in table  1 . these values",
    "coincide within the errors with the results obtained by connolly et al . in their analysis of the clustering in the hdf for @xmath52 .",
    "the standard way of relating the angular two - point correlation function @xmath1 to the spatial two - point correlation function @xmath53 is by means of the relativistic limber equation ( peebles , 1980 ) : @xmath54 ^ 2 } , \\label{eqn : limber } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the comoving coordinate , @xmath56 gives the correction for curvature , and the selection function @xmath57 satisfies the relation @xmath58 in which @xmath59 is the mean surface density on a surface of solid angle @xmath60 and @xmath61 is the number of objects in the given survey within the shell ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "given the small range of angular scales sampled by the hdf we can reasonably assume @xmath53 to have the redshift dependent power - law form @xmath63 where all the dependence on @xmath15 is included in the correlation scale length @xmath4 .",
    "the physical separation between two sources separated by an angle @xmath28 is given ( in the small angle approximation ) by : @xmath64    by including equations ( [ eqn : ndense ] ) , ( [ eqn : power ] ) and ( [ eqn : r1 ] ) in equation ( [ eqn : limber ] ) we then get the following expression for the angular correlation function @xmath1 @xmath65 ^ 2 } \\label{eqn : w}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath66\\gamma[(\\gamma-1)/2]/\\gamma[\\gamma/2]=3.68 $ ] in the case of @xmath8 , @xmath67 the hubble constant and @xmath68 is the density parameter , and @xmath69 .    if we consider a narrow redshift bin @xmath70 centred at some @xmath71 we can consider @xmath61 constant in that interval . under this assumption",
    "the expression for the correlation length @xmath72 in comoving coordinates is given by : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the amplitude of the angular correlation function @xmath1 for a particular redshift interval .",
    "note that in practice the error in redshifts ( true @xmath70 ) is the convolution of the measured @xmath70 with the error distribution .",
    "assuming gaussian error distribution , this will increase the effective @xmath70 in equation ( 8) by a factor @xmath75 , where @xmath70 is the bin width and @xmath76 is the @xmath77 error on each redshift .    [",

    "we have plotted the measurements coming from a @xmath0 binning ( filled circles ) , while for @xmath93 we only considered broader bins of width @xmath94 ( empty circles ) .",
    "the figure shows that @xmath3 is roughly constant with look - back time for @xmath95 . above this redshift",
    ", the clustering amplitude increases by more than a factor of 2 .",

    "according to the particular sample used ) . given the small volume sampled by the hdf data , the uncertainties are large , and the exact form of the evolution of @xmath3 is not well determined .",
    "the measurements are consistent with a slow decline followed by a smooth rise in amplitude above @xmath6 , as predicted by some galaxy formation models . from our measurements",
    "alone we can not rule out a simple smooth increase of @xmath3 with @xmath15 , but compared to local surveys our measurements at @xmath11 require a significant drop in the correlation length between @xmath98 and @xmath32 .",

    "the results show that , while for @xmath100 the clustering amplitude is roughly constant , for @xmath101 there is a significant increase in amplitude .    converting the projected clustering amplitude into the correlation length @xmath3 at different redshifts ,",
    "we find that @xmath4 is roughly constant as a function of look - back time until @xmath102 ; at higher redshifts the clustering amplitude rises to much higher values than for lower z s .",
    "our high - redshift measurements are in good agreement with those obtained from the analysis of the lyman break galaxies ( adelberger et al .",
    ", 1998 ; giavalisco et al . ,",
    "1998 ) .    under the assumption of linear evolution of mass fluctuations , we would expect a slow decrease in @xmath3 towards higher redshifts . however , we measure the clustering of galaxies , which are biased tracers of the mass .",
    "the bias level is unlikely to be a constant as a function of redshift ; any galaxy seen beyond @xmath103 has formed stars at an epoch earlier than most galaxies , and so is likely to be biased relative to an `` average '' galaxy . also , the hdf galaxy sample is selected on observed frame @xmath104 band and so different populations of galaxies are selected in the different redshift ranges : at @xmath11 the selection is roughly rest - frame b band , but at higher redshift samples are selected on rest - frame uv flux , which will preferentially select the galaxies with higher star - formation rates .    a further complication is caused by the effects of gravitational lensing .",
    "we expect that structure in the foreground mass distribution will introduce an extra component of clustering through the gravitational lensing magnification bias ( villumsen et al 1997 ) .",
    "the amplitude of this effect depends on the amplitude of mass fluctuations .",
    "hence the interpretation of galaxy clustering in the hdf at high redshifts is not at all straightforward .",
    "theoretical models ( see for instance kauffmann et al . , 1998 ;",
    "baugh et al . , 1998 ) predict a trend for the evolution of the clustering signal with look - back time that is similar to what detected in our analysis , but their results are strongly model - dependent .",
