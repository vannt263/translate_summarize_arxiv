    "n - body numerical simulations have established a link between the existence of boxy - shaped galaxy bulges and the presence of a bar instability in the disk ( combes and sanders , 1981 ; combes et al 1990 , hereafter called * c90 * ; raha et al 1991 ; pfenniger and friedli , 1991 ; friedli and martinet , 1993 ; friedli and benz , 1993 ) .",
    "the bar can thicken , driven by vertical resonances , giving the bulge a boxy - shaped or peanut appearance , provided that the galaxy is seen at a high inclination ( i@xmath570@xmath6 ) , and depending on the orientation of the major axis of the bar with respect to the line of nodes ( measured by the azimuth @xmath7 ) : an edge - on bar ( @xmath7=90@xmath6 ) adopts a boxy shape and the peanut feature appears for a large range of intermediate azimuths .",
    "the thickening is supported by star orbits that leave the galaxy plane and it occurs only in a _",
    "privileged _ region along the bar where there is coincidence between the horizontal resonance ilr ( @xmath8 + = @xmath9-@xmath10/2 ) and its vertical counterpart ( @xmath8=@xmath9-@xmath11/2 ) .",
    "other mechanisms , not related to the presence of a bar potential in the disk , can explain the formation of peanut bulges .",
    "several authors support the merger / accretion interpretation ( binney and petrou 1985 , shaw 1993 , shaw et al 1993 ) . the occurrence of dissipationless collapse of an isolated system ( lima - neto and combes 1995 ) , possibly in the presence of a bound companion ( may et al ( 1985 ) ) have also accounted for the existence of boxy shapes in galaxy bulges .    in view of the large variety of scenarios",
    "it is necessary to envisage a detailed comparison between the different models and the observations for specific objects .",
    "there are very few examples where the connection between bars and box - peanut bulges have been investigated from an observational point of view .",
    "bettoni and galletta 1994 found photometric evidence of a bar in the peanut spiral ngc4442 ; kuijken and merrifield 1995 studied a sample of edge - on spirals using h@xmath4 and optical lines as tracers of gas kinematics .",
    "however extinction effects can be severe in highly inclined disks where the column densities of gas and the associated dust can reach very high values .",
    "the use of _ macroscopically _ optically thin tracers such as co can help us to get a more clear picture of the gas kinematics , especially in the central regions of these spirals .",
    "in particular , in this work we investigate the link between bars and box - peanut bulges using co as a fair tracer of the molecular gas kinematics in the nuclear disk of a candidate galaxy : ngc4013 .",
    "the sbc edge - on spiral ngc4013 has been identified as an extreme box - peanut bulge object , as seen in the optical pictures of van der kruit and searle ( 1982 ) and jarvis ( 1986 ) .",
    "rand ( 1996 ) ( hereafter referred as * r96 * ) have taken deep h@xmath4 images of ngc4013 searching for extraplanar diffuse ionized gas ( dig ) , discovering an impressive set of filaments coming out the plane in the nuclear region .",
    "he suggests this is the signature of a nuclear outflow , after a starburst episode related with the distorted morphology of the nucleus .",
    "ngc4013 was mapped in the j=21 and 10 lines of @xmath0co with the iram 30 m telescope ( hpbw 13@xmath3 and 21@xmath3 , respectively ) by gmez de castro and garca - burillo , 1997 ( hereafter referred as * gcgb97 * ) .",
    "the co disk extends to r=100@xmath3 and it consists of a ring - like source ( of radius r=30 - 40@xmath3 ) and an unresolved fast - rotating nuclear disk .",
    "the high - velocity co component has no hi counterpart ( see bottema , 1987 , 1995 and 1996 ) and it is best explained by * gcgb97 * invoking the presence of a non - axisymmetric potential . still the spatial resolution of the observations was insufficient to undertake a detailed analysis of gas kinematics in the nucleus of the galaxy .",
    "furthermore the single - dish data suggested also the existence of _ out - of - the - plane _ gas that might be connected either with the vertical structure of the box - peanut bulge stable orbits , or the occurrence of an outflow and local ejections of material , as the dig measurements of * r96 * seem to indicate .",
    "high - resolution ( @xmath23@xmath3 ) interferometer co data of ngc4013 are presented in this work , intending to study the distribution and kinematics of molecular gas in the nucleus of this galaxy and hopefully clarify the nature of the link between bars and box / peanut bulges",
    ".    the study of dynamics of the gas in a peanut potential will deserve detailed numerical simulations involving both the stars and the gas , to be fully presented in a forthcoming publication ( paper ii ) .",
    "in this paper we limited ourselves to analyse whether there is a spontaneous and stable vertical response of the gas to a peanut potential , using a first run of numerical simulations .",
    "the @xmath0co(10 ) observations were made with the iram interferometer of plateau de bure ( see description in guilloteau et al 1992 ) , between december 1995 and march 1996 . during less than one third of the observing period we observed simultaneously the 21 line of @xmath0co .",
    "we used the compact ( cd ) 4-antenna configurations , consisting of 18 baselines ranging from 24 to 180 m. the declination of the source ( @xmath1244@xmath13 ) allowed good uv coverage and made possible to synthesize an ellipsoidal beam of fwhm=3.4@xmath143.3@xmath3 in the 10 line , adopting natural weighting and no taper on the visibilities ( fwhm=1.2@xmath3 + @xmath151@xmath3 in the 21 line ) .",
    "the @xmath0co(10 ) antenna half - power primary beam was 43@xmath16 ( 22@xmath16 in the @xmath0co(21 ) ) .",
    "the primary beam field was centered at @xmath4(j2000)=11@xmath1758@xmath1831.7@xmath19 , @xmath20(j2000)=43@xmath1356@xmath21 + 48.1@xmath3 . assuming a distance of 11.6 mpc ( bottema 1995 ) , the 43@xmath16 primary beam corresponds to 2.4 kpc ( 1@xmath3=56pc ) .    a total bandwidth of 430 mhz ( 1120 and 560 kms@xmath1 for the 10 and 21 lines respectively ) , centered at v=839kms@xmath1 ( lsr ) and largely covering the range of velocities observed in ngc4013 ( @xmath22250kms@xmath1 , according to * gcgb97 * ) ,",
    "was observed with a resolution of 2.5 and 1.25 mhz ( 6.5 kms@xmath1 and 3.3 kms@xmath1 at 115 and 230 ghz , respectively ) .",
    "the central 140 mhz of this band was also observed at 115 ghz with a resolution of 0.63 mhz ( 1.6 kms@xmath1 ) .",
    "data calibration was made in the standard way using the clic software package ( lucas 1992 ) .",
    "the correlator was calibrated every 20 min with a noise diode , and the rf passband once at the beginning of each observing run on 3c273 .",
    "the relative phase of the antennas was checked every 20 min on the nearby quasars 1308 + 256 and 1156 + 295 .",
    "the rms atmospheric phase fluctuations were typically between 10@xmath13 and 25@xmath13 at 115ghz .",
    "the data were then cleaned to yield channel maps .",
    "the rms noise in a 2.5 mhz - wide channel is 2.3mjy ( @xmath23=0.018k ) per 3.35@xmath24 beam at 115ghz ( the 1-@xmath25 noise is of 20mjy per beam in the 21 line or equivalently 0.35k ) .",
    "in the following , we will denote by @xmath26 and @xmath27 the kinematical major and minor axis of ngc4013 ( @xmath26 increasing to the ne and @xmath27 to the nw ) .",
    "all coordinates will be referred to the dynamical center ( x@xmath28,z@xmath28 ) which has been determined as follows : we first fit the position angle of the galaxy ( pa ) together with the z@xmath28 position of the disk , applying a standard least - squares method to the integrated intensity map of fig2a .",
    "the inferred value for the orientation of the galaxy plane is @xmath295@xmath13 , in agreement with the value derived from optical imaging .",
    "finally both x@xmath28 and the systemic velocity @xmath30 are derived imposing the maximum symmetry on the the inner 10@xmath3 region of major axis p  v plot taken at z = z@xmath28 .",
    "we calculate ( x@xmath28,z@xmath28)=(0,0)= @xmath31.36 , @xmath32.9 .",
    "this position coincides within 1@xmath3 with the radio - continuum sources detected at 6 cm and 21 cm ( note that bottema ( 1995 ) reports a wrong position for the radio - continuum source ) as well as with the optical center determined by palumbo et al 1988 .",
    "similarly , the velocities ( @xmath33 ) will be relative to @xmath30=840@xmath22 + 10 kms@xmath1 ( lsr ) .",
    "fig.1 shows the @xmath0co(10 ) velocity - channel maps observed with the interferometer ( oriented along x and z axes ) .",
    "emission appears from v=143 to 170 kms@xmath1 , concentrated in a rotating edge - on disk whose vertical structure is marginally resolved with our 3.4@xmath3 beam .",
    "however we notice out of the plane gas excursions mostly in the bottom - left quadrant ( within the range @xmath34x=(5@xmath3,25@xmath3 ) and @xmath34z=(3@xmath3,8@xmath3 ) ) , visible at certain velocities ( within the range @xmath34v=(20kms@xmath1,105kms@xmath1 ) ) .    at the derived dynamical center",
    "offset ( 0,0 ) , co emission displays a large spread of velocities : @xmath22130kms@xmath1 . as shown in fig.2a , which represents the @xmath0co(10 ) velocity - integrated temperature map , the observed high - velocity gas at the center is linked with the presence of a conspicuous co nuclear disk in the inner 100pc(2@xmath3 ) .",
    "the nuclear disk shows an east - west asymmetry : the maximum of emission is located at x@xmath22@xmath3 , i.e. , eastwards with respect to the dynamical center .",
    "the remarkable asymmetry of the inner 100pc of ngc4013 is more clearly shown by the higher resolution 21 data : fig.2b shows the velocity - integrated map in the 21 line which allows to resolve the nuclear disk radially .",
    "the latter displays an asymmetrical ring - like structure of radius r@xmath21.7@xmath3 ( 95pc ) .",
    "the overall distribution of molecular gas in the disk shows a similar e - w asymmetry with respect to ( 0,0 ) : co is stronger and it is more extended in the eastern side , up to x=35@xmath3 , than in the western side of the disk , up to x=-25@xmath3 ( the single - dish data of * gcgb97 * already showed this asymmetry holds for radii 40@xmath35r@xmath36100@xmath3 ) .",
    "the same asymmetry is echoed by other star formation tracers ( h@xmath4 and non - thermal radiocontinuum ) .",
    "a similar asymmetry in the co distribution is present in the inner nucleus of our galaxy ( bally et al 1987 , 1988 ) and other spirals ( see the case of ngc891 : garca - burillo and gulin , 1995 ) .      if we take a co to h@xmath37 conversion factor of x = n(h@xmath37)/i@xmath38=2.3@xmath15 + 10@xmath39@xmath40k@xmath1km@xmath1s(strong et al 1988 ) , the h@xmath41 mass derived from the @xmath0co(10 ) interferometer map is m(h@xmath37)=3@xmath1510@xmath42m@xmath43 . for this we assumed the distance to be d=11.6 mpc and integrated the co flux within a rectangular area of dimensions 70@xmath4418@xmath3 , centered on the position ( 0,0 ) . including the mass of helium , the total molecular gas mass in the bure field is m@xmath45=m(h@xmath37+he)=4@xmath1510@xmath42m@xmath43 .",
    "the nuclear disk mass content is derived to be close to m@xmath460.6@xmath1510@xmath42m@xmath43 ( this is an upper limit as we integrated i@xmath38 within r=2@xmath3 for all velocities , including the contribution of gas seen in projection close to ( 0,0 ) but located far from the nucleus in the plane of the galaxy ) .    taking into account that the shortest spacing measured by the interferometer is @xmath220 m , we expect to filter scales @xmath36l@xmath4720 - 25@xmath3 at 115ghz ( equivalently , @xmath36l@xmath4710 - 15@xmath3 at 230ghz ) .",
    "we have derived the fraction of the single - dish @xmath0co(10 ) and ( 21 ) fluxes included in the bure maps .",
    "the zero - spacing flux filtered out by the interferometer is kept very low in the 10 line : we detect nearly @xmath2100@xmath48 of the 30m - flux within the interferometer primary beam .",
    "on the contrary , the filtering is severe at 230ghz : we estimate that @xmath21/2 of the 30 m flux is missing in the 21 primary beam .",
    "assuming the vertical distribution to be gaussian - like we have derived the thickness of the co disk ( @xmath49 ) deconvolving the measured fwhm on the @xmath0co(10 ) velocity - integrated intensity map of fig.2a by our 3.4@xmath143.3@xmath3 synthesized beam .",
    "the inferred @xmath49 shows no systematic radial trend along the major axis and it varies between 1.5@xmath3 and 2.5@xmath3 , i.e. translated into spatial scales @xmath49=80 - 130pc .",
    "these values are comparable with the thickness of the thin molecular gas disk in the galaxy : 60100pc ( bronfman et al 1988 ) .",
    "the existence of co emission at high @xmath27 is clearly visible in the bottom left quadrant of fig.2a ( see also fig.3a ) .",
    "note that the lowest contour corresponds to 5@xmath50 , where a value of @xmath51=0.2jybeam@xmath1kms@xmath1 , has been obtained through the expression @xmath51=@xmath52v , taking @xmath25=0.002jybeam@xmath1 and @xmath34v=100 + kms@xmath1 .",
    "the mass of molecular gas at high @xmath27 is m(h@xmath37)@xmath21.5@xmath1510@xmath53 + m@xmath43 , ( @xmath2510@xmath48 of the total emission ) .",
    "the latter is a conservative lower limit as the co - to - h@xmath37 conversion factor might be significantly higher .",
    "the existence of vertical extensions of molecular gas in the nucleus were already suggested by * gcgb97 * using coarse resolution single - dish data .    the connection between the dig filaments discovered by * r96 * and the above reported co extraplanar emission is best illustrated at certain velocities .",
    "figs.3b - c - d represent an overlay of a k - band image of ngc@xmath544013 , showing the peanut bulge distortion of the nucleus in the region ( @xmath55 , @xmath49)= ( @xmath2215@xmath3 , @xmath2210@xmath3 ) with the co - velocity channel maps at v=26,52 and 104kms@xmath1 ( figs.3b , 3c and 3d , respectively ) . a sketch of the dig filaments of * r96 *",
    "is included for comparison .",
    "* r96 * interpreted the impressive set of 4 dig filaments above and below the nucleus of ngc@xmath544013 as the signature of a massive nuclear starburst .",
    "supernova explosions might inject a huge amount of energy to the gas finally lifted to high z. at close sight , filament a is associated with co emission breaking out of the plane ( v=26kms@xmath1 ) , although extraplanar gas appears to be more spread above the plane than the dig feature ( see v=52kms@xmath1 and fig 3a ) .",
    "filament b is also associated with extraplanar co ( v=104kms@xmath1 ) .",
    "we have estimated the gravitational potential energy of the extraplanar molecular gas associated with filament a ( the most impressive ) , using the inferred positions of co emission above the mid - plane .",
    "taking the two isothermal stellar components model of jacobi and kegel ( 1994 ) , fitted on the luminosity distribution out of the plane in ngc4013 , the resultant gravitational energy per unit mass @xmath7 is    @xmath56    @xmath57    where @xmath58 and @xmath59 stand for the stellar mid - plane densities and velocity dispersions of the i=1,2 components and h is the fitted scale height ( h=1.72kpc and @xmath60=58.3kms@xmath1 for ngc4013 , according to jacobi and kegel ( 1994 ) ) .",
    "the average height of the co extraplanar emission observed within the interval v=13,78kms@xmath1 is z@xmath2270pc , which gives a total potential energy of 50@xmath1510@xmath61ergs for @xmath62=4@xmath1510@xmath63m@xmath43 .",
    "we emphasize that the above equation allows to calculate the total potential energy of the material at height z , and therefore should be taken as a lower limit to the total input energy that must be given to the molecular gas in the plane to reach the observed values : first we have not considered the kinetic energy of these gaseous structures at present and we made no assumptions on the efficiency of the mechanism which is responsible for injecting the energy to the gas in the plane . whatever the nature of this energy source is ,",
    "at least 50 type ii supernovae are required ( assuming that a type ii supernova releases @xmath210@xmath61 ergs to the ism )",
    ". this lower limit might transform into an order of magnitude higher number of required sn , once the radiative and dissipative energy losses of the process are taken into account , henceforth suggesting that the nucleus of ngc 4013 might be experiencing a starburst episode . on the other hand , the restoring force of the galaxy plane is diminished near the position of the maximum distortion of the potential and this limit can be slightly lowered .",
    "the fir indices in ngc4013 do not indicate a massive starburst at the global scale of the disk : neither the normalised infrared fluxes , log(fir / a@xmath64=-13.8 ( where a@xmath65 is the galaxy major axis in arcminutes ) and log(fir / l@xmath66)=0.3 , nor the iras colors ( s@xmath67/s@xmath68=1.5 ; s@xmath69/s@xmath67=30 ) are indicative of typical starbursts ( see huang et al , 1996 for discussion of a large galaxy sample ) .",
    "however there is evidence that supports a starburst event in the nucleus : first , a huge fraction ( @xmath230@xmath48 ) of the total radio - continuum flux at 21 cm is emitted by the nuclear disk ; this fraction is the highest among the sample of galaxies published by hummel et al 1991 .",
    "most noticeably , there is an association between the h - shape of the dig filaments and extraplanar co emission with the box - peanut appearance of the bulge .",
    "a similar set of filaments has been discovered by rand in a galaxy also classified as a box - peanut : ngc3079 .",
    "connection between the nuclear starburst , the distorted stellar potential and the co kinematics is discussed below ( sections 5 and 6 ) .",
    "hi observations ( bottema 1995 ) showed the existence of a highly warped disk in ngc4013 .",
    "co emission at high z present in our observations could come from regions of the outer warped disk seen in projection near the nucleus .",
    "however a comparison of velocity channel maps of atomic and molecular gas leads us to reject this explanation : whereas co emission at high z appears at negative velocities in the bottom left quadrant ( figs . 2 - 3 ) , the hi warp shows up in the top left quadrant ( ne in fig . 2 of bottema 1995 ) within the same velocity range .",
    "fig.4a shows the @xmath0co(10 ) position - velocity diagram taken along the major axis .",
    "the high - inclination of the galaxy allows us to get the whole range of radial velocities in the plane .",
    "molecular gas emission is spread in a romboid - like region where we distinguish three velocity components :    * [ i]@xmath54the most outstanding component displays a large spread of velocities ( v=@xmath22130kms@xmath1 ) towards the dynamical center ( referred as the straight ridge * c * ) and it has no hi counterpart .",
    "the high - velocity gas corresponds to the central co nuclear disk identified in figs.2a - b and it extends from x=3@xmath3 to x=3@xmath3 .",
    "it is fully resolved in the 21 line where it extends from x=2@xmath3 to 2@xmath3 ; note that @xmath70 reaches a maximum value of @xmath21000kms@xmath1kpc@xmath1 in the inner 100 pc(2@xmath3 ) . *",
    "[ ii]@xmath54part of the emission is concentrated in a straight ridge ( * r * ) which slowly drifts in velocity when we move along the major axis : it extends from ( x=30@xmath3,v=80kms@xmath1 ) to ( x=30@xmath3,v=100kms@xmath1 ) .",
    "hi emission is detected in this region of the p - v plot according to bottema 1987 , 1995 and 1996 .",
    "co emission fills unevenly the p  v space between * c * and * r*. * [ iii]@xmath54we detect gas at non - circular velocities ( or velocities _ forbidden _ by circular rotation ) in the inner @xmath225@xmath3 .",
    "this region ( * f * ) extends symmetrically on both sides of the nucleus : at x@xmath23.5@xmath3 , we measure co emission up to v@xmath260kms@xmath1 , whereas circular rotation would impose v@xmath50 for x@xmath360 .",
    "the same applies for the offset x@xmath23.5@xmath3 where v@xmath260kms@xmath1 .",
    "we have derived the co - based rotation curve ( v@xmath71 ) from the terminal velocities method , applied to the p  v major axis diagram .",
    "we have used the 21 data in the inner x=@xmath222@xmath3 , the 10 data from 2@xmath35x@xmath3625@xmath3 , and finally added the 30 m data of * gcgb97 * for the outer disk ( 25@xmath35x@xmath36100@xmath3 ) . in the derivation , we have taken into account the effect of channel smearing ( @xmath34v=6.5kms@xmath1 ) and assumed a typical cloud - cloud velocity dispersion of @xmath210kms@xmath1 . finally we have assumed that @xmath33 is translatable into v@xmath71 , as circular - motions should be the main contributor to @xmath33 ( sofue 1996 ; garca - burillo 1997 ) .",
    "note that the hi - based rotation curve ( v@xmath72 ) can not account for the co high - velocity gas component * c*. the scarcity of atomic hydrogen in the nucleus , together with the low resolution of hi observations can explain the differences between v@xmath72 and v@xmath71 .",
    "we therefore conclude that the real rotation curve is certainly much steeper in the inner 20@xmath3 than inferred using hi data : v@xmath71=110kms@xmath1 at r=110pc , this implies a dynamical mass of m@xmath73=r@xmath74= 2.8@xmath1510@xmath42m@xmath43 , assuming a spheroidal component in the nuclear region ( a factor 0.6 lower in the case of a flat disk distribution ) .",
    "therefore , we estimate m@xmath45/m@xmath73 to be of 22@xmath48 inside the nuclear disk .",
    "the latter ratio goes down monotonically to reach 10@xmath48 at r=500pc .",
    "although the dynamics is still dominated by the stars , the contribution of molecular gas to the total mass content of the nuclear disk is significantly high and the effects of gas self - gravitation might not be negligible .    as stated above , the * f * component indicates the existence of emission at non - circular velocities .",
    "the high - resolution of the present observations precludes any explanation of * f * in terms of beam dilution : at x=@xmath223.5@xmath3 we are off by more than one synthesized beam from the center .      the presence of the * f * component is more readily explained by invoking a deviation from axisymmetry in the inner ( r@xmath2200pc ) mass distribution of ngc4013 .",
    "more precisely , we have observational evidence that the gas flow in this galaxy might be driven by a barred potential :    * the major axis p - v diagram shown in fig.4a displays the _ figure - of - eight _ shape typical of gas flowing along a bar ( binney et al 1991 ; garca - burillo and gulin 1995 ; kuijken and merrifield 1995 ) .",
    "components * c * and * r * , producing a double - peaked line - of - sight velocity plot , would correspond to molecular gas populating two different families of orbits : x@xmath37 inner orbits for * c * , and higher energy x@xmath75 orbits for * r*. the * f * component is best explained as the projection of the outer x@xmath75 orbits close to the cusped orbit . x@xmath37",
    "orbits develop between two inner linblad resonances ilrs ( the outer ( oilr ) and the inner ( iilr ) ) .",
    "x@xmath75 orbits exist between the oilr and the corotation of the bar ( cor ) .",
    "this particular morphology of the p - v plot can not be reproduced if we impose axisymmetry in the potential ( kuijken and merrifield 1995 ) .",
    "* moreover we expect to see the imprint of a bar in the radial distribution of molecular gas as a reflect of secular evolution .",
    "gravitational torques induce a radial redistribution of gas which accumulates in rings between the ilrs , the 4:1 or uhr resonance and the outer linblad resonance ( olr ) . as a result ,",
    "the corotation region is progressively emptied of gas .",
    "the radial distribution of gas in ngc4013 shows a compact central source of radius r@xmath22@xmath3 ( * c * ) , a region relatively emptied of gas between * c * and * r * ( r@xmath210 - 30@xmath3 ) and a secondary maximum towards r@xmath250@xmath3 ( according to the single - dish data of * gcgb97 * ) .",
    "this distribution , showing the existence of several rings , is well accounted by the bar hypothesis .",
    "* fig.6 shows the @xmath0co(21 ) isovelocity contours in the nuclear disk region .",
    "the z - distribution of molecular gas is spatially resolved at 1@xmath3 resolution : we detect the presence of a slight velocity gradient along the minor axis of the galaxy and a westwards tilt of @xmath260@xmath6 in the isovelocities of the nuclear disk , suggesting that we are seeing in projection a non - axisymmetric gas distribution .",
    "although the arguments enumerated above can not be taken as a proof of the existence of a barred potential , it all points out to this scenario as the simplest explanation . to explore on more firm grounds the consequences of this hypothesis , in the following section we try to locate the main resonances of the bar in the disk .",
    "the standard first - order approach consists of deriving the principal frequencies of the disk from the fitted rotation curve ( v@xmath71 ) : @xmath9 , @xmath9-@xmath10/2 , @xmath9+@xmath10/2 and @xmath9+@xmath10/4 ( see fig.5 ) . assuming the epicyclic approximation",
    ", we can figure out the value of the bar pattern speed ( @xmath76 ) and consequently the position of the main resonances , based on observational and theoretical arguments .",
    "this procedure is not intended to provide an accurate fit of @xmath76 , but to test if the basic results of numerical simulations are supported by the present observations .    as shown in fig.5",
    ", the @xmath9-@xmath10/2 curve presents a strong maximum ( @xmath2180kms@xmath1kpc@xmath1 ) at r@xmath23.5@xmath3 and it goes monotonically down to 1/10 of its peak value ( @xmath220kms@xmath1kpc@xmath1 ) at r@xmath220@xmath3 ; farther out , it stays quite flat until the edge of the optical disk .",
    "self - consistent numerical simulations of bars , including only the stellar component ( * c90 * ) , predict that the formation of the peanut occurs when the bar breaks up the plane near a _",
    "marginal _ ilr ( i.e. , the bar pattern speed remains always close to the maximum of @xmath9-@xmath10/2 ) .",
    "if this is to apply in ngc4013 , we would require the bar to have an unlikely high pattern - speed ( @xmath77180 + kms@xmath1kpc@xmath1 ) which also implies a _ marginal _ ilr at r@xmath24@xmath3 .",
    "the latter is not compatible with the observations : the maximum distortion of the peanut bulge in ngc@xmath78 is at r@xmath212@xmath3 .",
    "moreover , as we ignore a priori the orientation of the bar major axis along the line of sight , r@xmath212@xmath3 should be taken as a lower limit for the ilr .",
    "most of the available numerical simulations have treated the appearance of the peanut distortion and its evolution including only the stars .",
    "although the influence of a dissipative component on the fate of the peanut remains to be studied thoroughly , a plausible evolutionary sequence can be advanced here .",
    "the peanut instability first sets in at a _ marginal _ ilr of the bar , but this should be taken as a starting point .",
    "the subsequent inwards flux of gas towards the original ilr , driven by the bar s gravitational torque , can change the @xmath9-@xmath10/2 curve in the inner region .",
    "the curve can become progressively steeper and finally two inner linblad resonances ( outer ( oilr ) and inner ( iilr ) ) are bound to appear .",
    "the stellar bar itself is expected to slightly slow down in the process .",
    "the peanut distortion is the relic of an old _ marginal _ ilr ; however a _",
    "strong _ ilr region will develop in the course of time .",
    "any reasonable value of @xmath76 in ngc4013 implies we have two ilrs at present : an inspection of fig.5 leads to that conclusion unavoidably .",
    "therefore , the existence of a peanut instability and a _ strong _ ilr region in the nucleus may not be in contradiction , but should be taken as a result of secular evolution .",
    "numerical simulations to be developed in paper ii will allow us to test this scenario .",
    "fitting the bar pattern speed is beyond the scope of the present paper , however a lower limit on @xmath76 can be tentatively set .",
    "the radial distribution of molecular gas ( with a relative depression or hole between r=10@xmath3 and r=30@xmath3 ) suggest that corotation can not be at a radius larger than r@xmath250@xmath3 , implying that @xmath7760 - 70kms@xmath1kpc@xmath1 .",
    "the latter implies the following loci of principal resonances : r@xmath792@xmath3 , r@xmath8012@xmath3 , r@xmath8150@xmath3 , r@xmath8270@xmath3 and r@xmath83100@xmath3 .",
    "corotation of the bar is kept well inside the optical disk .",
    "this is expected for bars in spirals of early or intermediate hubble types such as ngc4013 , classified as sbc ( see combes and elmegreen 1993 ) .",
    "secondly , if @xmath7760 - 70kms@xmath1kpc@xmath1 , the oilr appears inside the old marginal ilr ( at 12@xmath3 ) , as proposed lines above .",
    "finally the major axis distribution of co showing a maximum at r@xmath250@xmath3 is well accounted for if a ring forms near the uhr resonance ( r@xmath8270@xmath3 ) .",
    "in a barred and peanut - shaped potential , the gas in principle tends to follow the periodic orbits , and is dragged through vertical resonances out of the plane , like the stars .",
    "however , the gas is dissipative , on a short time - scale ; cloud - cloud collisions occur with a characteristic collision time of 10@xmath84 yr . while the peanut and perpendicular elevation time scale is a long process , of time - scale almost 10@xmath85 yr ( * c90 * ) .",
    "therefore , the gas component looses its disordered kinetic energy , and in particular in the z - direction , rather quickly .",
    "the gas settles down in a very thin disk , irrespective of the peanut - shape potential .    in order to study",
    "if there can be a stable and spontaneous vertical response of gas in a peanut potential , we have performed self - consistent numerical simulations involving gas and stars . in this first run",
    ", the gas mass fraction is kept very low on purpose ( @xmath22% ) .",
    "the gas clouds are considered as sticky particles and we neglected the effects of self - gravitation .",
    "no effect of star formation on the gas dynamics is considered either .",
    "the code used is fft - based particle - mesh , with the gas treated as sticky particles ( combes & gerin 1985 ) .",
    "the useful grid is 128@xmath15128@xmath1564 , and the suppression of the fourier images is done through the algorithm of james ( 1977 ) .",
    "the run included 150k stellar particles and 40k gas particles .",
    "a bar forms spontaneously in the stellar component , since the bulge to disk mass ratio is 1/3 , and there is no other spheroidal component that could stabilize the disk .",
    "after 2@xmath1510@xmath85 yr , the bar has developped a characteristic peanut shape ( see contours of fig.7 ) .",
    "the main result is that , at any time , the gas disk remains very thin ( @xmath2 200pc at half - power ) , and is never perturbed by the peanut / shaped potential or only in a very transient manner ( see fig . 8) .",
    "the vertical thickening of the bar and the subsequent formation of the peanut can be caused by instabilities associated with resonances between the bar motion and the vertical oscillations of the stars(*c90 * ; see also binney(1981 ) ) ; this effect has also been attributed to the buckling or fire - house instability by raha et al 1991 .",
    "the bar instability first acts to increase the eccentricity of stellar orbits and align their principal axes ; this causes the buckling instability , precisely about the vertical resonance region , which increases vertical velocity dispersion and thickness .",
    "once the bar is thickened , the nature of the stellar orbits in the peanut can be described with orbits trapped around the 2:2:1 periodic orbit family : these correspond to the vertical lindblad resonance , where in the frame of the bar , the particles just perform two z - oscillations in one turn ( @xmath86 , the bar pattern speed ) .",
    "this happens to occur in the region of the in - plane inner lindblad resonance ( where @xmath87 ) , and therefore the resonant orbits have the 3-d shape of a banana ( projected into an ellipse in the plane ( * c90 * , pfenniger & friedli 1991 ) . a detailed orbital study has emphasized the bifurcations of the main periodic orbits @xmath88 onto the banana and anti - banana orbit families ( pfenniger & friedli 1991 ) .",
    "these periodic orbits , in a strong bar , very often possess loops , and the gas is not likely to follow them because of dissipation .",
    "this may explain the small propensity of the gas to be elevated vertically , at least for directly rotating orbits .",
    "for retrograde orbits , on the contrary , the orbit family @xmath89 bifurcates due to vertical instability into the anomalous orbits ( corresponding this time to a 1/1 resonance , or one vertical oscillation for one turn , pfenniger & friedli 1991 ) .",
    "this family does not possess loops , and the gas can be maintained more easily on these ( friedli & benz 1993 ) .",
    "these retrograde orbits could be populated in particular during an accretion event , where gas clouds arrive with a given angular momentum , un - correlated with that of the galaxy .",
    "the case of ngc128 is a remarkable example .",
    "it is a peanut - shaped galaxy seen edge - on , where an inclined gaseous disk is observed to counter - rotate with respect to the stars ( emsellem & arsenault 1997 ) .",
    "although this galaxy has apparently no sign of perturbed morphology , it has a companion nearby ( ngc127 ) which could have provided the retrograde gas .",
    "these stable retrograde orbits are characteristic of a tumbling triaxial potential .",
    "already van albada et al ( 1982 ) had remarked that in the rotating frame of a triaxial object , the coriolis forces on retrograde particles produce a torque , which is opposite to and compensates the torque of the restoring forces towards the plane .",
    "the latter would have made the retrograde orbits to precess , and since they differentially precess with radius , the clouds collisions and dissipation would have forced the gas to settle in the main plane .",
    "the coriolis forces , therefore , stabilise the gas into the inclined retrograde orbits .",
    "these orbits are not particularly related to the peanut shape , but both phenomena indicate the presence of bars .    in ngc4013 , the presence of a prodigious warp ( bottema et al 1987 ) suggests that a large amount of gas has recently been accreted with un - related angular momentum .",
    "part of it could have gone towards the center .",
    "if spontaneously , directly - rotating gas will not stay at large height above the plane due to the peanut shape of the potential , it is possible that accreted gas with a different angular momentum , not aligned with the principal axis , could be trapped in banana orbits , or more likely in retrograde anomalous orbits .",
    "more simulations are needed , taking into account the accretion origin of the gas , and also its larger mass fraction and self - gravity ( see paper ii ) .    an alternative mechanism to explain the presence of gas at high altitude above the plane , is the galactic fountain effect , due to massive star formation .",
    "this could explain the morphology of the h@xmath4 filaments , that appear much higher above the plane than the neutral gas , traced by the co emission in the center .",
    "the fact that the filaments seem to coincide with the peanut region might not be a coincidence : the gas is easier to expel when the restoring force of the plane is less , i.e. in the thicker stellar plane .",
    "extraplanar neutral+ionized gas and dust have been found in another edge - on spiral : ngc891 .",
    "the existence of a thick molecular disk , containing m(h@xmath37)@xmath210@xmath42m@xmath90 up to z@xmath21kpc , was first established by garca - burillo et al ( 1992 ) using single dish co observations .",
    "* r96 * also reports the detection of an extended dig halo with some prominent h@xmath4 filaments in this galaxy .",
    "recently howk and savage ( 1997 ) have discovered the dusty counterpart of the thick co disk : the hst and wiyn optical bvr images of ngc891 show hundreds of dust filaments lying far from the mid - plane .",
    "the derived neutral gas mass content of these absorbing structures closely agrees with the co - based estimates .",
    "although some of the extraplanar dust features are interpreted as supernova - driven galactic chimneys , other are less clearly linked with highly energetic phenomena in the disk . in either cases , the existence of an extended neutral+ionized gas with a set of dust filaments is related to the high star formation efficiency in the disk ( garca - burillo et al 1992 ; * r96 * ; howk and savage 1997 ) .",
    "we have observed with the iram interferometer the emission of the 10 and 21 lines of @xmath0co in the nucleus of ngc4013 , an edge - on sbc spiral possessing a box - shaped bulge , with spatial resolutions of @xmath23.3@xmath3 and @xmath21.2@xmath3 , respectively .",
    "our maps show the presence of a distinct fast - rotating ( v@xmath91 + @xmath2130kms@xmath1 ) nuclear disk of radius r@xmath22@xmath3(100pc ) and gas mass m@xmath460.6@xmath1510@xmath42m@xmath43 .",
    "the high - velocity component ( absent in the hi map ) is accompanied by gas emission at non - circular velocities within @xmath223@xmath3 from the dynamical center , indicating that the gas flow is driven by a non - axisymmetrical potential .",
    "an analysis of the gas kinematics , derived from the @xmath0co(10 ) major axis position - velocity plot and the @xmath0co(21 ) isovelocities map , supports a bar model for ngc4013 .",
    "the observed ring - like distribution of molecular gas ( at r@xmath22@xmath3(100pc ) and r@xmath250@xmath3(2.7kpc ) ; the outer ring inferred from the 30 m map ) is interpreted as the imprint of a bar .    although a link between the bar and the box - shaped bulge in ngc4013 is suggested , there are apparent discrepancies between the results of numerical simulations and the model proposed here .",
    "disagreement concerns the basic parameters of the bar generating the peanut . in self - consistent simulations of the star component the peanut forms near the locus of a _ marginal _ ilr of the bar . instead",
    ", the derived @xmath9-@xmath10/2 curve in ngc4013 leaves little doubt of the existence of a _ strong _ ilr response , irrespective of the chosen pattern speed of the bar ( @xmath76 ) . the nuclear disk would be located in the vicinity of the iilr , with no gaseous ring counterpart in the oilr .",
    "the present observations suggest that the inclusion of a dissipative component in simulations might probably change the evolution of the stellar peanut : although the latter appears near a marginal ilr , the inflow of gas driven by the bar , makes two ilrs appear and accelerates the secular evolution of the gaseous disk in the inner @xmath21kpc region of the galaxy .",
    "numerical simulations , involving both the stars and the gas in a peanut potential , will analyse the response of the gas in the disk of the galaxy fully testing the bar hypothesis ( see paper ii ) .",
    "we analysed the vertical distribution of molecular gas , showing that , although the bulk of co emission comes from a thin disk ( with deconvolved thickness fwhm@xmath280 - 130pc ) , there is a non - negligible amount of molecular gas ( m(h@xmath37)=1.5@xmath1510@xmath84m@xmath43 ) at large z distances from the plane ( z@xmath2200 - 300pc ) .",
    "the close relationship between the dig filaments seen in h@xmath4 coming out of the plane and the presence of molecular gas emission , suggests that both share a common origin : gas ejected by a massive nuclear starburst .",
    "a preliminary run of simulations has restricted to study the vertical response of the gas to a peanut potential , that spontaneously forms in a disk of stars .",
    "gas clouds are treated as test particles and we neglect here the effects of star formation and self - gravity in the gas dynamics . due to its dissipative nature , the gas forms a thin disk very quickly .",
    "contrary to the stars , the gas can not be maintained at high altitude above the galaxy plane along stable orbits .",
    "cloud - cloud collisions make impossible the population of banana and antibabana self - intersecting orbits .",
    "moreover , it remains to be studied if gas clouds can populate the vertical bifurcation of the retrograde x@xmath92 family in a peanut , after an accretion episode ( see paper ii ) .",
    "however this mechanism is unlikely to hold for ngc4013 , where the bulk of the gas in the disk is directly rotating .    among the different explanations for the gas at high z  inclined resonant orbits connected to the peanut , gas accretion in the course of an interaction and ,",
    "finally , the galactic fountain model the latter seems the best to account for the h@xmath4 and co filaments .",
    "although the peanut distortion formed in the stars comes from a bar in the disk ( the presence of the latter being suggested by the observed co kinematics ) , gas is being ejected in the nucleus after a bar driven starburst .",
    "the filaments come from the inner 200pc(4@xmath3 ) and reach a height of several kpc , coinciding with the maximum peanut distortion where the strength of the restoring forces of the plane is diminished .",
