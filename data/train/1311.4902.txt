    "<S> [ f1]c , d.    we can qualitatively explain the observed transitions as follows . when the system is dilute , particles separate whenever the total velocity difference of the colliding particles is not damped to zero during the collision . </S>",
    "<S> this occurs for model cd@xmath24 ( cd@xmath22 ) even in the strongly inelastic limit of small @xmath62 , since the normal ( tangential ) component of the velocity difference does not get damped at all . for cd </S>",
    "<S> it happens only at larger @xmath62 when collisions are less inelastic . </S>",
    "<S> for dense systems , however , many body effects become important . at sufficiently dense @xmath0 , </S>",
    "<S> normally directed relative particle motion becomes energetically prohibitive ; it is a compressive motion that would induce particle overlaps , and so is constrained by the dense particle geometry . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast to tangential relative particle motion which corresponds to a local shear deformation with particles sliding around each other with minimal overlaps . </S>",
    "<S> thus in cd@xmath22 , where tangential relative motion is not damped , particles continue to separate after collisions . </S>",
    "<S> but in cd@xmath24 and cd , where tangential relative motion is damped , particles form clusters . </S>",
    "<S> indeed we find that for all models , at densities @xmath119 the relative motion of particles in contact is almost always tangential , with the particles separation @xmath120 very nearly orthogonal to their relative motion @xmath121 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a similar result was found for the response of statically jammed packings to a small shear deformation @xcite .    to conclude </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that the rheology of soft - core frictionless disks is strongly dependent on the specific form of the dissipative interaction . at dense @xmath0 in collisional models , </S>",
    "<S> tangential dissipation is crucial for the particle clustering that gives newtonian rheology . </S>",
    "<S> bagnoldian rheology results when particles separate after collisions and the average contact number @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> sharp transitions between bagnoldian and newtonian rheology may exist as a function of particle density @xmath0 and the degree of inelasticity of collisions as measured by @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> in the small @xmath62 ( small @xmath37 ) regime of strongly inelastic collisions , the rheology curves approach a limiting form in both the overdamped and inertial cases , that extends from the low @xmath1 hard - core limit into the higher @xmath1 region where soft - core effects are manifest . </S>"
