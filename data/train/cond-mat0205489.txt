    "building blocks are arranged to cover the space quasiperiodically .",
    "two approaches to build quasilattices have been proposed .",
    "one approach uses a single unit cell , but allows adjacent cells to overlap .",
    "gummelt  @xcite proved that using a limited number of overlapping positions between decagons produces a quasicrystal structure .",
    "steinhardt and jeong  @xcite further proved that the overlapping conditions can be relaxed when supplemented by the maximization of a specific cluster density to produce quasilattices .",
    "this is the `` quasi - unit cell '' approach .    in the other `` tiling '' approach ,",
    "space is covered with building blocks called tiles .",
    "two or more tile types are used  @xcite .",
    "no overlapping is allowed , and depending on the way the tiles are arranged , quasicrystal structures can be produced . matching",
    "rules between tiles govern the local tile configurations by allowing only a subset of all possible arrangements . globally , the matching rules enforce quasiperiodicity  @xcite .",
    "penrose proposed his famous matching rules before the discovery of quasicrystalline materials . in 2d ,",
    "penrose tiles are fat and thin rhombi ( fig  [ fig : penrose]a ) .",
    "edges are assigned arrow decorations which must match for common edges in adjacent tiles . in perfect quasicrystals",
    "these rules are obeyed everywhere .",
    "the very restrictive penrose matching rules are sufficient , but not necessary , to force quasiperiodicity .",
    "socolar  @xcite showed that weaker matching rules can still force quasilattices .",
    "the less restrictive set of rules are derived by allowing bounded fluctuations in perp space .",
    "furthermore , matching rules can be abandoned entirely and quasiperiodicity may arise spontaneously in the most probable random tiling  @xcite .",
    "a fundamental question is whether matching rules are enforced by energetics of real materials .",
    "burkov  @xcite proposed matching rule enforcement by chemical ordering of co and cu among certain cites in al - co - cu . however , that model involved an unnatural symmetry linking co sites to cu sites .",
    "cockayne and widom  @xcite deduced a different , physically realistic , type of co / cu ordering based on total energy calculations . in their model , tile edges are assigned arrow direction based on their co / cu decorations ( fig.[fig : penrose]b ) .",
    "the suggested physical origin of co / cu chemical ordering rests on the status of cu as a noble metal with completely filled d orbitals , unlike normal transition metals such as co.    in a tiling model of quasicrystals , the actual atomic interactions in the system hamiltonian can be replaced with effective interactions between and within tiles  @xcite .",
    "the resulting tile hamiltonian is a rearrangement of contributions to the actual total energy . in simple atomic interaction pictures ( pair potentials for example )",
    "the relation between the two ( actual atomic interactions and tile hamiltonian ) is straight forward",
    ". it might be difficult to find the relations between them for more complicated atomic interactions ( many body potentials , or full _ ab - initio _ energetics , for example ) but it is theoretically possible .",
    "the tile hamiltonian includes terms which depends only on the number of tiles and other terms for different interactions .",
    "the tile hamiltonian greatly simplifies our understanding of the relationship between structure and energy , and it is a reasonable way to describe the tiles .",
    "space can be tiled in many different ways , even when holding the number of atoms or the number of similar tiles fixed .",
    "figure  [ fig : app132 ] shows three different tiling configurations of 132 atoms . the first two have the same tiles arranged differently .",
    "the third has the same atoms but different tiles .",
    "these are called quasicrystal approximants ( crystals that are very close to quasicrystals in structure and properties ) .",
    "one advantage of approximants is that they can be studied using conventional tools developed for ordinary crystals .    in a previous paper  @xcite",
    "we studied matching rules in decagonal al - co - cu using a limited group of quasicrystal approximants .",

    "pure 72@xmath0 angle interaction parameters ( @xmath25 ) can be deduced if the bond to be swapped has an equal number of 144@xmath0 connections on each side ( since we can arrange for 144@xmath0 interaction to cancel ) and either a single 72@xmath0 connection which can be attached to any side or two 72@xmath0 connections attached to the same side .",

    "[ fig : app132]a is one example that yields @xmath32 ev .",

    "the graph shows clearly that the three - parameter fit is not adequate because there is a significant variations of @xmath37 among different approximants .",

    "for example , the data quoted does not include arbitrary offsets eatom  @xcite of each chemical species .",
    "however , the difference @xmath41 ev _ is _ meaningful because the offsets cancel out ( since s@xmath11h@xmath20 has the same number of atoms of each type as b@xmath15h@xmath15 ) .",

    "in contrast to the number of 72@xmath0 angles , the number of which is determined entirely by the number of tiles , the number of 144@xmath0 angles depends on the arrangements of tiles . as a result , we may calculate all three energies @xmath44 independently .",
    "the fitting is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vasp9 ] .",
    "the remaining deviation from the y = x line ( standard deviation=0.0013 ev ) is due to other effects not included in our model @xmath38 ( eq .  [ eq : tileham ] ) , as well as incomplete convergence or other calculational inaccuracies .",
    "the ground state total energy of a system can be expanded in terms of a volume energy and potentials describing n - body ( n=2,3,4 , ... ) interactions  @xcite .",
    "the volume energy is the dominant contribution to cohesive energy .",
    "it depends on the composition and density , but not the specific structure .",
    "the n - body interactions distinguish between different crystal structures at the same composition and density .",
    "it is customary to truncate this n - body series at the pair potentials ( n=2 ) , because they are much easier to calculate and use , and because higher order interactions are often weak . even for transition metals , with their localized d - band , the truncation at pair potentials proved to be practical  @xcite .",

    "the 3d shell has six electrons and the 4s shell is filled .",
    "the partial filling of the d - band strongly influences atomic interactions .",
    "the 3d shell in cu is filled with electrons and the 4s has one electron which makes cu act more like a simple metal .",
    "the d - band of cu is buried and does nt participate strongly in interactions .",
    "this is why chemical ordering is strong for cocu pairs but not for coni pairs .",
    "an important issue is the position of the symmetry - breaking al atom inside a hexagon we mentioned in section  [ sec : decagonalalcocu ] .",
    "there are two symmetrically related positions between the two internal co atoms , and we force the al atom to take one of these positions as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : penrose]b ( left ) .",
    "if the horizontal edge arrows are parallel to each other , the al atom prefers to reside in the side closest to the co atoms by about 0.03 ev . with the off - center al , we define the decomposition of the hexagon into rhombi such that the symmetry - breaking al is placed as in fig .",
    "[ fig : penrose ] .",
    "the position of the internal al atom inside a hexagon , together with the horizontal tile edge arrows , define a `` direction '' for the hexagon .",
    "we noticed that generally hexagons prefer to align parallel to each other in our h@xmath15 structure by about 0.01 ev .",
    "these effects are very small but are enough to account for some of the discrepancies between @xmath37 and @xmath38 in our calculations .",
    "the decomposition of the hexagon into rhombi is lost by placing the al atom exactly at the center of the hexagon .",
    "however , this position is lower in energy by 0.2 ev as calculated by vasp . in the pair potential picture ,",
    "the central position for the al atom is preferred by 0.11 ev / cell using mgpt and 0.01 ev / cell using mock - ternary potentials .",
    "depending on the edge decoration , this al may relax very slightly from the central positions , but this effect is minimal and does not significantly influence the energy .",
    "thus a more realistic model in which the al atoms are centered should be described even more accurately by our tile hamiltonian .",
    "one more small effect appears in `` hidden '' 144@xmath67 angles , where two 72@xmath0 angles share one edge making an extra 144@xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : b1 ] has two hidden 144 s ) .",
    "the shared edge orientation affects the angle interaction @xmath44 of the outer edges .",
    "we calculate the difference e@xmath72-e@xmath27 with the shared edge pointing outward and again with it pointing inward . with the shared edge",
    "outward pointing , the difference e@xmath72-e@xmath73 ev .",
    "an inward - pointing middle edge raises the difference by 0.015 ev , so that @xmath74 ev",
    ". this effective three - arrow interaction can account for more of the remaining small discrepancies between @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "so far we have examined interactions within the quasiperiodic plane .",
    "now consider perpendicular interactions .",
    "pairs of tm atoms on tile edges are 1.51     apart within the quasiperiodic plane and 2.07     apart along the perpendicular , periodic direction .",
    "the net bond length is 2.56   .",
    "the lines connecting them make a zigzag of alternating tm atoms extending along the periodic axes .",
    "we turn our attention to atomic order in this direction .",
    "approximant b@xmath15h@xmath15 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : app132]a ) has a horizontal glide plane parallel to the long side of its unit cell that can be exploited for this purpose .",
    "we swap one cocu pair on a horizontal edge ( call this pair a ) and call the structure ( a ) .",
    "another structure ( b ) is made from b@xmath15h@xmath15 by swapping instead the glide - equivalent image of pair a ( call this pair b ) .",
    "these two structures have equal energies by symmetry .",
    "further , we build a 264 atom unit cell by stacking two 132 atom unit cells .",
    "it is built once by stacking an a layer over an a layer and another time by stacking a b layer over an a layer . in the aa",
    "stacking , tm alternation along the vertical zigzag is conserved . in ab the zigzag sequence",
    "is violated along pair a and along pair b. along each pair the alternation defect includes a coco pair and a cucu pair .",
    "the aa and ab structure energies are calculated with a k - point mesh of 2x2x5 .",
    "the difference @xmath75 ev per 264-atom cell .",
    "we discuss here the implications of our findings on the structure of decagonal alcocu .",
    "the main result is that now energy can be calculated quickly and accurately for these compounds by adding the relevant terms in the tile hamiltonian @xmath38 ( eq .  [ eq : tileham ] ) using parameters obtained in table  [ tab : energycosts ] .",
    "for example , consider the cohesive energy of each tile type .",
    "we define a tie - line energy @xmath76 to be the energy per atom of the pure element : fcc al , fcc cu and spin - polarized hcp co. the structure energies lie below the tie - line and the difference is the cohesive energy per atom , @xmath77 .",
    "we calculate @xmath78=-4.17 $ ] ev / atom , @xmath79=-4.72 $ ] ev / atom and @xmath80=-8.07 $ ] ev / atom , all at the experimental lattice constants .",
    "the tile cohesive energies are @xmath81=$]-7.75 ev , @xmath82=$]-12.4 ev and @xmath83=$]-16.81 ev ( using data from our eight - parameter fit ) . the difference between two boats and a hexagon - star pair is @xmath84-e_{coh}[\\mbox{h}]-e_{coh}[\\mbox{s}]=$ ] -0.24 ev .",
    "we can add up the cohesive energies of the tiles to obtain a quick estimate of the cohesive energy of the quasicrystal .",
    "for hbs tilings , the `` golden '' ratio h : b : s=@xmath85:@xmath86:@xmath87 can be obtained , for example , by removing double - arrow edges from a penrose tiling  @xcite .",
    "for such a tiling the cohesive energy is -0.3035 ev / atom .",
    "our results show that stars are disfavored , and a tiling with hexagon and boats is lower in energy .",
    "the ratio of h : b in hb tilings is 1:@xmath88 and the cohesive energy is -.3045 ev / atom .",
    "most bonds participate in combinations of 144@xmath0 and 72@xmath0 angles .",
    "the stronger interactions determine bond arrowing .",
    "when a bond is surrounded by a total of four 144@xmath67 angles and no 72@xmath0 angles , the middle bond is a part of 144@xmath67 zigzag and its decoration does nt matter .",
    "an example of this is circled in fig .",
    "[ fig : b2 ] .",
    "there is only one configuration where a bond orientation _ is _ determined by 144@xmath67 interactions .",
    "this is the configuration we used to get pure 144@xmath67 angle effects ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : abinitiostudy ] ) .",
    "these configurations occur occasionally ( one is in fig .  [",
    "fig : app132]b ) , but usually bond orientations are determined primarily by 72@xmath0 interactions .",
    "quasicrystals are observed to be stable mainly at high temperatures  @xcite .",
    "this can be due to a variety of entropic contributions .",
    "transitions from crystal to quasicrystal phases are reported at about t@xmath891000k  @xcite or about k@xmath90t=0.1 ev . at such temperatures",
    "the 144@xmath67 angle interactions are irrelevant because they are small compared to energy fluctuations , and the structure is determined primarily by its tile types and by the 72@xmath67 angle interactions .",
    "our model expectations are in reasonable agreement with calculated energies , suggesting that we have captured the most important energetic effects .",
    "the worst deviation is about 0.1 ev . out of that we account for 0.03 - 0.05 ev from the internal al atom effects on tile edges .",
    "the rest can be a collection of long range interactions .",
    "we do see these long range effects in some instances .",
    "for example , when calculating pure 72@xmath0 angle interactions using the bond surrounded by a rectangle in fig .",
    "[ fig : app132]a in two different approximants ( b@xmath15h@xmath15 and s@xmath11h@xmath20 ) .",
    "the environments are identical up to about 7   , but a difference of about 0.02 ev in e@xmath91-e@xmath92 between the two cases shows up .      in our previous paper  @xcite , we reported several results related to edge arrowing calculated using an all - electron multiple scattering method known as lsms  @xcite .",
    "approximants h@xmath15 and h@xmath14 were used , with internal al atoms centered .",
    "the swap energy for chemical ordering agrees in sign , but vasp s is four times bigger that lsms .",
    "other swaps that give 2e@xmath29-e@xmath93-e@xmath28 agree in sign , with a similar factor disagreement in magnitudes .",
    "further studies might include the effect of tmal ( as opposed to cocu ) arrows on tile edges .",
    "the difficulty comes from the fact that such arrowing exist not only on tile edges but also inside the tiles .",
    "phason disorder along the periodic axes is important .",
    "so far we studied only co / cu disorder along the periodic axis but not tile flips .",
    "the system s behavior under relaxation and the preferred relaxed atomic positions are wide areas to explore .",
    "relaxation may alter the quantitative values of our tile hamiltonian parameters .",
    "finally , the biggest unresolved question is : what type of structure minimizes the value of our tile hamiltonian ?",
