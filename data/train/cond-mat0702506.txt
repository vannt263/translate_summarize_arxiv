    "the spreading of a quantum mechanical wavepacket for a particle moving in a periodic lattice is a textbook example .",
    "one finds that the width increases ballistically with time and the corresponding eigenstates are extended ( bloch states ) . in the opposite case of strongly disordered systems , the eigenstates are exponentially localized , resulting in a total halt of the wavepacket spreading in the long - time limit @xcite . between these extremes flourishes the world of quantum systems with anomalous diffusion .",
    "these include systems studied in the early days of quantum mechanics , such as bloch electrons in a magnetic field @xcite as well as quasicrystals @xcite and disordered systems at the metal - insulator transition @xcite . in these cases , the eigenfunctions ( or even the spectrum )",
    "show a fractal structure which dictates the wavepacket spreading .",
    "the physical motivation to study such systems , along with the mathematically intriguing nature of their spectra , led to a series of works that eventually advanced our understanding of their dynamical properties .",
    "most of these works have focused on the analysis of the temporal decay of the survival probability @xmath6 at the initial position @xmath7 and the growth of the wavepacket second moment @xmath8 @xcite .    despite all this activity , nothing is known about the effect of nonlinearity in the wavepacket spreading for systems with fractal spectra and eigenfunctions .",
    "noticeable exceptions are refs .  9 and 10 which numerically studied the wavepacket dynamics for the prototype one - dimensional ( 1d ) tight - binding harper model with nonlinearity . their conclusions , however , are contradictory . although both studies conclude that _ infinitesimal _ nonlinearity results in a short - time subdiffusive spreading of the variance @xmath9 , they give different values for the power - law exponent . while ref .",
    "10 concludes that the subdiffusive spreading persists for longer time , ref .",
    "9 reports a saturation of the second moment .",
    "moreover , they both fail to identify traces of the underlying linear model s multifractality in the dynamics generated by the corresponding nonlinear one .    in the present paper",
    ", we address the nonlinearity - induced destruction of the anomalous diffusion .",
    "our focus is on the 1d harper model at criticality but we expect that our results will be applicable for other critical models ( such as fibonacci lattices ) as well . our detailed numerical calculations and theoretical arguments show that there is a _ critical nonlinearity _ @xmath10 , above which the nature of anomalous diffusion ( associated with the linear model ) is altered .",
    "in particular , we found that for parametrically large time , the average ( over initial sites ) spreading of an initially localized @xmath11like wavepacket spreads as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the the fractal dimension of the local density of states ( ldos ) and @xmath3 is _ independent _ of the nonlinearity @xmath0 .",

    "the spectrum is a zero measure cantor set @xcite , while the eigenstates show self - similar fluctuations on all scales @xcite .    for the critical case , where @xmath29 , previous studies show that the temporal decay of the probability to remain at the original site @xmath7 up to time @xmath23 goes as @xmath30 while the wavepacket second moment grows as @xmath31 where the exponent @xmath32 depends on both @xmath13 and the correlation dimension of the fractal eigenfunctions @xmath33@xcite in fact , recent studies were able to demonstrate that the center of the wavepacket spatially decreases as @xmath34 for @xmath35 while the front shape scales as @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the height of the wave profile at time @xmath23 .",
