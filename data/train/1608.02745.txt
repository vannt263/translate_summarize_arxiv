    "injection and extraction from an accelerator are critical operations on short time - scales with a high risk of significant beam loss in the case of equipment malfunction or badly adjusted parameters .",
    "figure [ fig : meibei ] , which is taken from a presentation at an lhc workshop on beam - induced quenches , highlights how prominent losses induced by beam transfer actions are in the day - to - day operation of accelerators .",
    "the example is from the relativistic heavy ion collider accelerator at brookhaven national laboratory . while in the first part of this lecture some of the typical injection , extraction , and transfer line configurations , along with associated equipment , are discussed , the second part is dedicated to a presentation of the machine protection systems developed for the lhc injection and beam dump system , as examples for machine protection systems for beam transfer .",
    "various different injection techniques exist in the different machines around the world .",
    "the chosen technique depends on the requirements in terms of loss acceptance , brightness , and particle type used .",
    "this section , as well as sections  [ sec : transfer lines ] and [ sec : extraction ] , is based on the lectures by b.  goddard , w.  bartmann , m.  barnes and m.  meddahi at the cern accelerator school @xcite .",
    "this type of injection is typically used for transfer between machines in an accelerator chain in association with _ boxcar stacking , _ where a larger ring is filled sequentially by a smaller one .",
    "angle and position errors at the injection point lead to injection oscillations , while optical errors lead to betatron mismatch . both can cause emittance blow - up . as",
    "most of the machine protection concepts will be introduced in connection with this type of injection , it will be described in detail in section  [ sec : single - turn injection and injection equipment ] .      in the case of multiturn injection for hadrons ,",
    "phase - space painting is used to increase the total circulating intensity .",
    "the variant of h@xmath0-injection allows injection into the same phase - space area after stripping the h@xmath0 ions to protons . in this way the intensity is increased while keeping the emittance small .      in the case of high - energy leptons , as were used for the lep accelerator , injection precision and matching is of less concern for emittance blow - up , owing to damping with synchrotron radiation .",
    "this fact can be used to inject beams off - momentum or at an angle and increase the intensity in the same phase - space volume after damping .",
    "these techniques are called betatron and synchrotron accumulation , respectively .",
    "figure [ fig : singleturn ] shows the principle of single - turn injection .",
    "a transfer line brings the beam close to the orbit of the circular machine .",
    "the last two magnetic elements are special injection magnets .",
    "the first of these is called a septum magnet .",
    "it is already so close to the circulating beam that the iron yoke and coils of a conventional magnet would no longer fit between the trajectory of the injected beam and the orbit of the circulating beam .",
    "instead , a septum magnet has an aperture with a magnetic field for the injected beam and another aperture without a magnetic field through which the circulating beam passes . between the two regions ,",
    "there is a thin septum .",
    "the septum deflects the beam onto the closed orbit at the centre of a kicker magnet .",
    "the kicker magnet compensates for the remaining angle .",
    "the kicker magnet , however , has only one aperture , through which both the injected and circulating beams pass .",
    "kicker magnets are pulsed magnets with very fast rise and fall times , such that they provide the required magnetic field at the moment of the passage of the injected beam and no field during the passage of the circulating beam .",
    "the septum and kicker magnets are typically installed on either side of a defocusing quadrupole in the plane of the kicker magnet to minimize the kick strength .",
    "the actions of the two magnet systems in normalized phase - space are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : singleturn_illustration ] .         phase advance to meet the kicker magnet ( plot 2 ) .",
    "the kicker deflection aligns the beam on the central orbit ( plot 3 ) . ]      a general introduction to septa can be found in ref .",
    "two main types of septa exist",
    " electrostatic septa and magnetic septa .",
    "electrostatic septa have a very thin ( typically @xmath1 ) separation between the zero - field and high - field regions .",
    "they are often used for extraction systems , to minimize losses at extraction and the required kick strength or strength of the following septa .",
    "magnetic septa are pulsed or dc dipole magnets with a 220  separation between the zero - field and high - field regions .",
    "figure [ fig : septum ] shows a direct - drive pulsed septum magnet .",
    "this type of magnet is often used under vacuum to minimize the distance between the circulating and deflected beams . to minimize the self - inductance and for mechanical reasons , the coil generally consists of a single turn , resulting in large required currents of typically 5. single - turn injection uses magnetic septa",
    ".          a full lecture on kicker magnets can be found in ref .",
    "kicker magnets typically produce rectangular field pulses with fast rise and fall times .",
    "the field strength is lower than can be achieved with septum magnets . for comparison ,",
    "the lhc injection septum provides roughly 12  of bending angle in five magnets , whereas the injection kicker magnets provide 0.8  in four magnets .",
    "the injection energy in the lhc is 450 . to achieve fast rise and fall times ,",
    "a voltage pulse is pre - charged in a so - called pulse forming line , a coaxial cable , or a pulse forming network , all of which are lumped elements .",
    "this voltage pulse is launched towards the kicker when the _ main switch _ is closed .",
    "the main sub - systems of a typical kicker system are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kicker_subsystems ] . pulse forming networks and lines accumulate electric energy over a comparatively long time from a power supply ( a few milliseconds in the case of a fast resonant charging power supply ) and then release it in the form of a square pulse of relatively short duration ( a few microseconds ) .",
    "figure [ fig : mki ] shows the lhc injection kicker magnet .     by the resonant charging power supply ( rcps ) .",
    "when the _ main switch _ closes a pulse of magnitude @xmath2 is launched towards the magnet through the transmission line ( coaxial cable ) .",
    "the impedances in the system should be matched , to avoid reflections .",
    "the length of the pulse in the magnet can be controlled between 0 and 2 @xmath3 by adjusting the timing of the dump switch relative to the main switch . ]",
    "a typical kicker cross - section is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kickercrosssection ] .",
    "the characteristics of the field in the kicker gap are : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the magnetic field , @xmath6 the current , @xmath7 the gap height , @xmath8 the length , @xmath9 the gap width , @xmath10 the inductance , and @xmath11 the kicker voltage .",
    "a typical kicker @xmath12 would be in 1 .",
    "in general , kickers have a low inductance .",
    "nevertheless , for short rise times , very high voltages of the order of several tens of kilovolts are required .",
    "kicker switches , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : kicker_subsystems ] , therefore need to hold high voltages and to switch high currents within short rise times .",
    "_ thyratron _ switches ( gas tubes ) or solid - state switches are frequently used for this purpose . as can be anticipated ,",
    "kicker switches are associated with a number of possible failure scenarios .",
    "there are two main categories .    * * erratic turn - on : * the switches turn on spontaneously and the kickers fire asynchronously , during the circulating beam passage instead of the injected beam . *",
    "* missing : * the switch does not fire .",
    "so - called magnet _ flash - overs _ are another kicker failure category , and are independent of the switches .",
    "a flash - over is a discharge between kicker electrodes while the kicker has high field .",
    "depending on which cell , and hence where in the kicker , the flash - over occurs , it results in a reduced or even increased kick strength , owing to reflection .",
    ", magnetic field ; @xmath7 , gap height ; @xmath6 , current ; @xmath9 , gap width ]    as the bending angle exerted by the kicker magnets is generally large , kicker failures belong to the group of very fast beam loss mechanisms . if the kicker magnets are being used to inject a beam , the resulting _ injection oscillations _ would be too large to establish a circulating beam . the beam would be lost on the first turn . in case of an asynchronous kick on the circulating beam , the resulting oscillations around the ring would be so large that the beam would be lost within a single turn .",
    "not all kicker failures can be prevented by design but the risk for some can be minimized .",
    "for example , fast resonant charging power supplies are used to charge the pulse forming networks quickly .",
    "the charging then only takes place a few milliseconds before the kick is required .",
    "the probability of an error is reduced in this way .",
    "many kicker failures require _ passive protection _ , see section [ sec : passive_protection ] .",
    "errors during injection can lead to beam loss due to _",
    "mismatch_.      steering errors , a difference in position and angle ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) between the circulating orbit and the injected trajectory at the injection point , lead to _",
    "injection oscillations_. the injected beam will oscillate around the closed orbit . with the presence of non - linearities in the machine , this oscillation will decohere after a number of turns . as a result ,",
    "the beam emittance and hence the beam sizes around the ring will increase .",
    "if the initial oscillation amplitude is large enough , it can lead to beam loss as early as the first turn .",
    "the mechanism of generating injection oscillations is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : injosc_explain ] . figure [ fig : injosc ] shows the lhc injection oscillation display in the lhc control room . instead of showing the trajectory turn after turn at one beam position monitor , the injection oscillation display shows the trajectory along many beam position monitors , covering many oscillation phases .",
    "the twiss parameters at the injection point define the shape and orientation of the particles phase - space ellipse .",
    "one speaks of optical mismatch if the shape and orientation of the ellipse of the injected beam does not match the ellipse of the circulating beam at the injection point .",
    "an example of such a situation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : optmismatch ] . the black mismatched ellipse will change its orientation turn after turn , with its extremities following the contour of the dashed ellipse .",
    "this causes beam size beating at the injection point or any other point of observation .",
    "non - linear effects , magnetic field multipoles , however , will introduce amplitude dependent differences in particle motion and , over many turns , a phase - space oscillation is transformed into an emittance increase .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : filamentation ] .",
    "so - called filamentation eventually fills a larger ellipse .",
    "the larger ellipse has the same shape and orientation as the matched one .",
    "transfer lines transport the beam between accelerators and onto targets , dumps , and instruments .",
    "the beam dynamics in a transfer line are not only determined by the strength of the elements in the transfer line . instead , the twiss parameters at any point in the line , @xmath15(s ) , @xmath16(s ) , are also a function of the initial functions , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : tl_optics ] .",
    "the strengths of the line are kept the same but the initial conditions are modified . as a result ,",
    "the beta functions change .",
    "the same is true for the dispersion function .    :",
    "the strengths of the magnetic elements in the line are kept the same , but the initial conditions are modified to produce the red and black optics . ]",
    "another difference with respect to circular machines is the effect of an error at a particular location in the line . whereas in a circular machine",
    "the error will introduce a perturbation around the entire ring , in a transfer line the error will affect only the part of the line downstream of the error location , see fig . [",
    "fig : tl_error ] .    .",
    "]    if transfer lines are used to link two machines , the twiss parameters of the extraction point have to be propagated through the line and matched to the twiss parameters at the injection point of the next machine by adjusting the quadrupole strengths in the line accordingly , see fig .",
    "[ fig : tl_matching ] . from the previous discussion , we know that the twiss parameters , and hence the orientation of the phase - space ellipse of the injected beam , have to be the same as the twiss parameters , and orientation , of the phase - space ellipse of the circulating beam at the injection point , to avoid optical mismatch .",
    "the twiss parameters can be propagated if the transfer matrix @xmath19 is known :        @xmath20    @xmath21    typically , eight variables need to be matched ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 , the dispersion @xmath22 and its derivative @xmath23 in both planes ) .",
    "frequently , constraints such as phase advance requirements for transfer line collimators or insertions for special equipment such as stripping foils have to be respected .",
    "independently powered quadrupole magnets with adjustable strength are used for this purpose .",
    "if the transfer lines are long , the problem can be simplified by designing the lines in separate sections .",
    "the main part of the line then consists of a regular central section with a regular lattice , a fodo or doublet with the quadrupoles at a regular spacing and powered in series . at the end and the beginning of the line , initial and final matching sections with independently powered quadrupoles are installed .",
    "an example of this type of layout is the lhc transfer line shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lhc_tl ] .",
    "+        to counteract trajectory deviations due to magnet misalignments and field and powering errors , transfer lines are usually also equipped with beam position monitors and independently powered small dipole corrector magnets .",

    "as in the case of injection , there are various different techniques to extract the beam from a circular machine .",
    "a few methods will be briefly summarized .      as for single - turn injection ,",
    "kicker magnets and septa are used for single - turn fast extraction . to reduce the required kicker magnet strength ,",
    "the beam is sometimes moved close to the septum by a closed orbit bump .",
    "an example of a typical fast extraction layout is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : single_turn_extraction ] .",
    "the kicker magnet deflects the entire beam into the septum in a single turn .",
    "the septum then bends the beam into the transfer line .",
    "the smallest deflection angles are required for a phase advance of @xmath26 between the kicker and the septum .",
    "the septum deflection may also be in the other plane from the kicker deflection .",
    "losses around the ring or in the extraction channel at the moment of the extraction process can originate from orbit errors ( closed orbit bump errors ) , kicker failures , kick synchronization errors or particles in the extraction gap during which the extraction kicker field rises ( uncaptured beam ) .",
    "an example of a kicker rising in an extraction gap populated with particles is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cngs_extraction ] for the cern neutrino to gran sasso fast extraction from the cern sps .",
    "this type of extraction is used to fill a larger machine from a smaller one over several turns .",
    "the beam is sliced into equal parts by a fast orbit bump that puts the whole beam onto the septum .",
    "the beam is extracted in a few turns with the machine tune rotating the beam .",
    "this type of extraction is an intrinsically high - loss process .",
    "multipole fields from sextupoles or octupoles are used to distort the circular normalized phase - space and define a stable area delimited by unstable fixed points .",
    "the beam is slowly extracted by approaching the respective resonance increasingly closely and going across it . by adjusting the tune change speed ,",
    "the extracted intensity can be controlled and a constant particle spill can be achieved .",
    "an alternative to the non - resonant multiturn extraction with lower losses is the resonant low - loss multiturn extraction .",
    "non - linear fields ( sextupole and octupole ) are used to create islands of stability in phase - space .",
    "the particles are driven into the islands through tune variations .",
    "the islands are separated further in phase - space by varying the non - linear fields .",
    "the islands are then extracted in a similar manner as for the non - resonant multiturn extraction with a fast bump turn after turn .",
    "the typical concepts for machine protection systems for beam transfer will be introduced with the example of the sps to lhc injection process and the lhc beam dumping system .",
    "the lhc is filled with 12 injections from the sps .",

    "the disabling of interlocks is called ` masking ' .",
    "a number of systems can have maskable interlocks in the beam interlock controller matrix .",

    "the beam dump system is one of the main components of the machine protection system .",
    "it is connected to the machine s beam permit and is triggered when the permit disappears .",
    "fast - rising kicker magnets ( and sometimes septa ) are used , as for a fast extraction system , to steer the beam onto a beam dump block .",
    "the beam dump block can be installed in the circular machine , if it is an internal beam dump , or at the end of a transfer line , if it is an external beam dump .",
    "the system has to work for all energies and beam types of the accelerator .",
    "as kicker systems are involved , the beam dump system itself can cause very fast and hence very severe failures .",
    "the design has to take the failure scenarios in account and foresee sufficient redundancy and surveillance . in the lhc ,",
    "the allowable failure rate is @xmath50 to @xmath51 , which corresponds to safety integrity level 3 .",
    "in contrast with a pure fast extraction system , where the pulse forming networks only have to be charged a few milliseconds before the extraction request , the beam dump pulse forming networks are always charged . the charging voltage follows the energy of the accelerator . a system to derive the energy from the synchrotron is required . in the lhc and sps , this system",
    "is called the beam energy tracking system ( bets ) .",
    "the energy information is derived from the main dipole currents @xcite .",
    "the lhc bets surveys the correct energy tracking of the pulse forming networks and other involved equipment , such as the dump septa currents . if a tracking error occurs , the beam dump is triggered immediately before the error becomes too large .",
    "the lhc beam dump system is installed in long straight section 6 .",
    "the distance between the kicker magnets and the dump block is 975 .",
    "an overview of long straight section 6 , the dump equipment and dump lines is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : lss6 ] .",
    "the beam dump block itself is made of 0.7  and 3.5  lengths of graphite with a density of 1.73/@xmath52 , interspersed with 3.5  lengths of lower - density graphite ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "this is followed by 1  of  and 2  of  at the end .",
    "the core is in a steel cylinder and in inert @xmath54 gas .",
    "it is surrounded by about of radiation shielding blocks .",
    "the beam dump is designed such that no structural damage is to be expected during 20  of operation with ultimate lhc intensities ( @xmath55 protons per bunch in 3.5  emittance and 2808 bunches ) .",
    "nevertheless , the dump block is only sufficiently robust for 7  protons with beam dilution .",
    "a set of vertical and horizontal dilution kickers is installed in the extraction channel , to sweep the beam onto the beam dump block",
    ". not all bunches , therefore , will end up on the same spot . the resulting lhc beam dump sweep shape is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mkb_sweep ] , and the waveforms of the horizontal and vertical dilution kickers are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mkb_waveform ] .    .",
    "]          the lhc dump kicker magnets have a rise time of 3 .",
    "no particles are allowed in the so - called abort gap , whose length corresponds to the kicker rise time , fig .",
    "[ fig : abort_gap ] .",
    "even if the gap is kept particle - free , the kickers can still trigger spontaneously or asynchronously .",
    "passive protection is therefore installed at the front face of the septum magnets ( tcds ) and 90@xmath45 downstream of the mkd dump kickers to protect the lhc circulating aperture ( tcdq ) .",
    "the tcdq is a 9  long single - sided movable absorber made of graphite .",
    "a fixed mask in front of the superconducting q4 quadrupole protects the q4 from damage from secondary showers generated in the tcdq in the case of an impact .",
    "gaps come from the lhc injection kicker rise time requirements .",
    "there is one large gap of @xmath56 for the dump kicker rise time .",
    "the beam must not be injected into the gap .",
    "mechanisms are arranged to prevent this and any uncaptured beam is cleaned out of the gap after transverse feedback .",
    "the red line indicates the dump kicker ( mkd ) waveform . ]",
    "the different failure scenarios of the lhc beam dump system have been analyzed and divided into three categories .",
    "this category of failures should not happen in the lhc lifetime , as they would result in severe damage to the machine .",
    "several layers of redundancy are built into the system to cover against them :    * not receiving the trigger from the beam interlock system after a failure in the lhc ; * failure of beam energy tracking and extracting the entire beam at the wrong angle ; * fewer than 14 of the 15 dump kicker magnets firing during a dump ; * fewer than 3 of the 10 dilution kickers firing during a dump .",
    "the beam dump system and clean dump action depend on a number of conditions that must be monitored .",
    "if these conditions degrade , a dump is issued while the conditions are still sufficient for a clean dump .",
    "examples are :    * failures of general services ( electricity , vacuum , cooling , ethernet ,  ) ; * bad beam position in dump region ; * magnet powering failure of extraction equipment .    this category of failures can not be prevented by surveillance systems and involve failures of the kicker systems .",
    "redundancy has been built into the number of required dump kickers to ensure correct extraction .",
    "these failures can be tolerated and will not cause damage :    * one missing extraction kicker magnet ; * missing dilution kicker magnets ; * erratic behaviour of a dilution kicker magnet .",
    "finally there is a set of possible kicker failures where passive protection is required .",
    "they can not be tolerated without correct settings of the passive protection element tcdq :    * erratic behaviour of an extraction kicker magnet ( spurious asynchronous trigger ) .",
    "a number of additional concepts have been invented around and for the machine protection of lhc beam transfer systems , which have not been introduced in this lecture .",
    "some of these will be covered in the lecture by j. wenninger on _ machine protection and operation for the lhc_. a very important issue concerns the automatic _ post - operational checks _ and post - mortem system , which verify the correct functioning of the relevant systems after each beam transfer by launching a quick analysis of a number of recorded datasets from equipment and beam instrumentation @xcite .",
    "degradation of the systems and increased likelihood of a failure are detected by these checks .",
    "this allows experts to intervene before an actual failure occurs .",
