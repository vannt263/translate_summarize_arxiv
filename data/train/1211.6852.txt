    "( 1995 ) +    [ cores_sample ]    it is widely believed that the source of energy of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is the accretion of matter onto a supermassive black hole with an accretion disk , located in the centre of the galaxy .",
    "while there have been many theoretical and numerical studies of accretion flows ( e.g. hawley 2011 ) , observational studies of the gaseous components in the circumnuclear regions could provide useful insights towards understanding the dynamics and properties of the gas that might be fuelling the agn . at radio frequencies an important method of probing this region",
    "is via 21-cm hi absorption towards compact radio sources , such as the cores of radio galaxies and quasars , and the compact steep - spectrum ( css ) and gigahertz peaked - spectrum ( gps ) sources .",
    "the css and gps objects ( o dea 1998 ) typically have sizes of @xmath210 and 1 kpc respectively , and are believed to be the young ( @xmath310@xmath4 yr ) progenitors of the larger radio galaxies and quasars which extend up to a few mpc , with the largest sources being typically @xmath510@xmath6 yr old ( jamrozy et al . 2008 ; konar et al . 2008 ) .",
    "such studies could also help us study the evolution of the gaseous component with the age of the radio source and also test consistency of these properties with the unified schemes for agn ( pihlstrm , conway & vermeulen 2003 ; gupta & saikia 2006b ; curran & whiting 2010 )",
    ".    studies of hi absorption towards radio galaxies and quasars have shown that the absorption lines are more often detected towards css and gps objects , with previous studies ( pihlstrm , conway & vermeulen 2003 ; gupta et al .",
    "2006 ; chandola , sirothia & saikia 2011 ) showing an apparent anti - correlation between the integrated optical depth and source size . for an assumed fixed value of the covering fraction and spin temperature",
    "this corresponds to an anti - correlation with the neutral hydrogen column density .",
    "gupta & saikia ( 2006b ) found the 21-cm absorption detection rate to be higher towards the css and gps sources identified with galaxies than with quasars .",
    "they find that there is a tendency for the detection rate as well as the column density for galaxies to increase with core prominence , a statistical indicator of the orientation of the jet axis to the line of sight .",
    "this can be understood in a scenario where radio sources are larger than the scale of the circumnuclear hi disk so that the lines of sight to the lobes at very large inclinations do not intersect the disc . on the other hand , curran & whiting ( 2010 ) and more recently allison et al .",
    "( 2012 ) have investigated the effect of uv luminosity on the 21-cm absorption detection rate .",
    "they found that after excluding the sources with uv luminosities , @xmath7@xmath010@xmath8whz@xmath1 , the 21-cm absorption detection rate for compact radio sources is only marginally higher than for other radio sources .",
    "curran & whiting suggest that higher 21-cm absorption detection rate amongst compact objects is probably due to their generally low uv luminosity rather than their compact sizes or orientation .    compared with the studies of hi absorption towards css and gps objects ,",
    "the extended radio sources have received less attention .",

    "as the radio source grows from the gps and css scales to larger dimensions , it is necessary to probe the gas on similar scales from radio observations probing the compact regions with comparable optical depths .",
    "this can be achieved via 21-cm hi observations towards the radio cores of large radio sources with resolutions of about a few arcsec or better so that the core is resolved from the more extended emission and can be unambiguously identified .",
    "such observations will also enable us to determine any differences in the hi properties of fri and frii sources .",
    "there have been suggestions that the mode of fuelling the nucleus and the structure of the torus / disk may be different for the fri and frii radio sources , with those in fris being geometrically thin ( e.g. morganti et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "in this paper we present the results of 21-cm hi absorption observations towards the cores of fri and frii radio galaxies with the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) , and combine our results with those in the literature to examine any evolution in the hi properties in the circumnuclear region with source size .",
    "possible differences between fri and frii radio galaxies , and the distribution of the velocities of the absorbing components relative to the systemic velocities have also been examined .",

    "we have also avoided inclusion of qsos , bl lacs , spirals or seyferts in the sample as we wanted to have a sample of radio galaxies with their hosts being ellipticals . thus combining our observations of 16 sources listed in table  [ cores_sample ] and the 31 sources listed in table  [ cores_fsample ] , we obtain a sample of 47 radio sources , called the ` cores sample ' .",

    "( 2006 ) . from this compilation of 62 css and gps sources we consider 60 sources .",
    "we exclude j1415 + 1320 and j1945 + 7055 as these were reported as individual detections . to enlarge this sample",
    "further we also consider 21-cm absorption searches based on samples of steep - spectrum sources reported in the literature since 2006 .",
    "we consider measurements of 17 sources from chandola , sirothia & saikia ( 2011 ) , 5 compact sources ( b0258 + 35 , b0648 + 27 , b1122 + 39 , b1447 + 27 , b1557 + 26 ) with steep spectrum from emonts et al .",

    "the measurements of 10 compact sources with steep spectrum are available from allison et al .",
    "( 2012 ) but detailed size information is not available for these .",
    "so we are not able to include these in our sample .",
    "thus we have a sample of 84 css and gps sources .",
    "this sample has column densities or upper limits to these ranging from @xmath5@xmath2210@xmath18 @xmath19 to @xmath2310@xmath18 @xmath19 with a median value of @xmath2410@xmath18@xmath19 assuming that the values for the non - detections are close to the upper limits . to ensure that the sources are observed to similar sensitivity limits so that the distributions of column densities are similar for both the ` cores ' and the ` css and gps ' samples , we considered all the sources from ` css and gps sample ' with a column density estimate or an upper limit to it which is at least 1.5@xmath2510@xmath18 @xmath19 .",
    "this leaves us with a sample of 49 css and gps sources with a median column density sensitivity of @xmath26@xmath2510@xmath18 @xmath19 , assuming again that the values for the non - detections are close to the upper limits .",
    "the detection rate for the ` cores sample ' is rather low ( 7/47 ; @xmath515% ; see fig .",
    "[ cores_distribution ] ) compared with the detection rate for compact css and gps sources ( 28/49 ; @xmath557% ; see fig .  [ css_distribution ] lower panel ) . considering the entire sample of 84 css and gps objects , the detection rate ( 31/84 ; @xmath537% ;",
    "see fig .",
    "[ css_distribution ] upper panel ) is again significantly higher than for the ` cores sample ' .",
    "all but one of the sources from ` css and gps sample ' with column density values @xmath271.5@xmath2510@xmath18 @xmath19 represent sensitive observations of css and gps objects with no detection of hi in absorption .",
    "we have also examined the vlbi - scale structure ( references given in table  [ cores_sample ] and table  [ cores_fsample ] ) of the cores of the larger sources ( ` cores sample ' ) and find that they tend to have a core - jet structure where most of the flux density is from the vlbi - scale core component which is usually smaller than the css and gps sources suggesting that the difference in hi absorption detection rate is not due to different covering factors .",
    "although it would be useful to confirm it from a larger sample , clearly the detection rate of hi in absorption towards the cores of larger sources is smaller than for the css and gps objects , suggesting an evolution in the gaseous content of the host galaxies .",
    "it is also interesting to examine the hi detection rate for fri and frii radio sources in case this reflects any differences in either the torus / disk or fuelling processes ( e.g. morganti et al .",
    "2001 ; emonts et al . 2010 ) . in the ` cores sample ' hi is detected in absorption towards 4 out of 32 ( @xmath513% ) fri objects , compared with 3 out of 15 ( @xmath520% ) for the frii sources . within statistical errors , there is no significant difference in the detection rate towards the cores for fri and frii radio sources .",
    "these have been observed with similar sensitivity .      as mentioned earlier ,",
    "the hi column density in css and gps objects appears to be anti - correlated with source size ( pihlstrm , conway & vermeulen 2003 ; gupta et al .",
    "2006 ; chandola , sirothia & saikia 2011 ) , but shows no evidence of any dependence on either redshift or luminosity ( gupta et al . 2006 ) . on sub - galactic scales ,",
    "the observed anti - correlation has been interpreted by pihlstrm , conway & vermeulen ( 2003 ) to be due to gas distributions with a radial power law density profile .",
    "it is also relevant to note here that emonts et al .",
    "( 2010 ) observed a sample of radio galaxies to detect hi in emission and found an inverse relation between hi mass and sources size .    in fig .",
    "[ cores_nhivssize ] we plot the 21-cm hi column density towards the cores against the projected linear size in kpc for the sample of 47 radio galaxies . in this figure",
    ", we also plot an additional nine sources where hi detection has been reported from observations with angular resolutions of a few arcsec for single sources ( see table  [ cores_dsample ] ) , giving a total of 16 detections .",
    "the linear sizes range from tens of kpc to over a mpc while the column densities vary from 0.5@xmath25 10@xmath18 @xmath19 to 69@xmath2510@xmath18 @xmath19 .",
    "there does not seem to be any significant relation between the hi column density towards the cores and the largest projected linear sizes of the sources",
    ".      the relative velocity of the absorbing gas could be significantly blue shifted if it is due to gas which has been accelerated by interaction with the radio jet , while infalling material fuelling the central engine would appear red shifted .",
    "an important component of the unification scheme for frii radio galaxies is the presence of a circumnuclear disk / torus .",
    "hi gas associated with this and rotating around the nucleus may appear both blue and red shifted relative to the systemic velocity .",
    "it is worth noting that css and gps objects often show complex line profiles with both blue- and red - shifted hi absorption components .",
    "we compare the relative velocity of the principal absorbing component for the 16 detections towards cores of larger sources with the 33 detections(including 2 sources from gupta et al .",
    "( 2006 ) which we left out earlier while doing statistical analysis of detection rates ) towards css and gps objects .",
    "while making these comparisons it is also relevant to note that different ionization lines may yield somewhat different systemic velocities .",
    "for example in 3c452 , the low - ionization forbidden emission lines are broader and more red - shifted than the high - ionization ones .",
    "the typical error in optical systemic velocity estimate for the sample is @xmath5 90 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "[ cores_velhist ] shows that although a few css and gps objects have large blue - shifted velocities of @xmath01000 km s@xmath1 possibly due to jet - cloud interactions , the distributions for the cores and css and gps objects are not significantly different .",
    "also one of the objects with the highly blue - shifted component , j1815 + 6127 , has a large error of @xmath5900 km  s@xmath1 ( vermeulen & taylor 1995 ) in its optical systemic velocity .",
    "the highly red - shifted component seen towards the core of ngc1275 in the perseus cluster could be due to a gas cloud or galaxy in the intracluster medium moving towards ngc1275 ( de young , roberts & saslaw 1973 ) .",
    "we have presented the results from a search for 21-cm absorption towards the cores of 16 fri and frii radio galaxies . from our search",
    "we have reported earlier one new detection , i.e. towards the core of the radio galaxy j2245 + 3941 ( 3c452 ) ( gupta & saikia 2006a ) , and have now presented the upper limits on n(hi ) for the remaining 15 sources .",
    "we have combined our results with those of similar 21-cm absorption searches in the literature to obtain a larger sample , called the ` cores sample ' , of 47 radio galaxies , and have summarized our results here .    1 .",
    "the upper limits to the hi column density towards the cores of large sources presented here range from @xmath50.5 to 69@xmath2510@xmath18 @xmath19 .",
    "2 .   considering observations of similar sensitivity",
    ", we find that the detection rate of hi absorption towards the cores of larger ( @xmath1615 kpc ) sources is only @xmath515 per cent , compared with @xmath557 per cent for css and gps objects , suggesting an evolution in the gaseous content of the host galaxies as the radio sources age and grow in size .",
    "the hi column density towards the core vs the largest linear size plot for the large sources shows no significant correlation between these parameters .",
    "the distribution of the relative velocity of the principal absorbing component towards the cores of large sources is not significantly different from that of the css and gps objects , although a few of the css and gps objects show large blue - shifted velocites ( @xmath01000 km s@xmath1 ) possibly due to jet - cloud interactions .",
    "5 .   for the ` cores sample ' , hi absorption",
    "is detected towards 4 out of 32 ( @xmath513% ) fri objects , and 3 out of 15 ( @xmath520% ) frii sources .",
    "although there have been suggestions of differences in the torus / disk structure and fuelling mechanisms between fri and frii sources , with the small number of detections there does not appear to be a significant difference in the detection rate between these two types of radio sources .",

    "<S> we present the results of giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) observations to detect hi in absorption towards the cores of a sample of radio galaxies . from observations of a sample of 16 sources , we detect hi in absorption towards the core of only one source , the frii radio galaxy 3c452 which has been reported earlier by gupta & saikia ( 2006a ) . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we present the results for the remaining sources which have been observed to a similar optical depth as for a comparison sample of compact steep - spectrum ( css ) and giga - hertz peaked spectrum ( gps ) sources . </S>",
    "<S> we also compile available information on hi absorption towards the cores of extended radio sources observed with angular resolutions of a few arcsec or better . </S>",
    "<S> the fraction of extended sources with detection of hi absorption towards their cores is significantly smaller ( 7/47 ) than the fraction of hi detection towards css and gps objects ( 28/49 ) . for the cores of extended sources </S>",
    "<S> , there is no evidence of a significant correlation between hi column density towards the cores and the largest linear size of the sources . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of the relative velocity of the principal absorbing component towards the cores of extended sources is not significantly different from that of the css and gps objects . </S>",
    "<S> however , a few of the css and gps objects have blue - shifted components @xmath01000 km s@xmath1 , possibly due to jet - cloud interactions . with the small number of detections towards cores , the difference in detection rate between fri ( 4/32 ) and frii ( 3/15 ) sources is within the statistical uncertainties .
