    "the determination of the excited baryon spectrum is an important step on the road to understanding the dynamics of qcd , and it is , for example , a vital element of the jefferson laboratory experimental program .",
    "lattice gauge theory has a pivotal role not only in providing _",
    "ab initio _ calculations of the masses of the lowest lying states , but also in establishing the quark and gluon content of the states .",
    "there has thus been increasing activity amongst the lattice community that has demonstrated that the masses of the lowest - lying baryon states of both parities for spin-@xmath0 and spin-@xmath1 are accessible to lattice calculation , and there have been calculations of the mass of the first positive - parity , spin-@xmath0 excitation of the nucleon , the so - called roper resonance .",
    "most of these calculations have been made in the quenched approximation to qcd , and an important component of future lattice studies will be a careful analysis of the systematic uncertainties on these results .",
    "however , the confrontation of lattice calculations with experiment will require a more complete understanding of the spectrum , obtaining both the masses of the higher spins and of the radial excitations .",
    "furthermore , the discovery of the quark and gluon structure of the excited states will require a more extensive basis of interpolating operators than used so far , allowing both for excited glue and for multi - quark operators .",
    "the aim of this talk is to describe the design of such operators , and in particular to construct operators that transform irreducibly under the symmetries of the lattice .",
    "the remainder of this talk is laid out as follows . in the next section",
    ", the methodology of computing the spectrum is described , and the symmetries used to classify baryon states are detailed .",
    "gauge - invariant `` elemental '' operators that have the correct flavor structure and that explore the spatial structure of the baryons are then introduced .",
    "the reduction of these operators to ones that transform irreducibly under the cubic symmetry of the lattice is then performed .",
    "finally , the reduction is illustrated for the case of point - like elemental operators obtained using domain - wall fermion ( dwf ) valence propagators computed on a dynamical asqtad - fermion background .",
    "the computation of the spectrum of states in lattice qcd is in principle straightforward .    1 .",
    "choose an interpolating operator @xmath2 that has a good overlap with @xmath3 , the state of interest , @xmath4 and ideally a small overlap with other states having the same quantum numbers .",
    "form the time - sliced correlation function @xmath5 3 .",
    "insert a complete set of states between @xmath2 and @xmath6 .",
    "the time - sliced sum puts the intermediate states at definite momentum , and we find @xmath7 where the sum over @xmath3 includes the contributions from two - particle and higher states .",
    "continue to euclidean space @xmath8 , yielding @xmath9 so that the correlator falls off exponentially with the mass of the lightest state at large times .    in order to obtain the mass of the higher resonances in eqn .",
    "[ eq : spectral_sum ] , the most appealing approach is to apply variational methods@xcite , beginning with the computation of a matrix of correlators @xmath10 where the @xmath11 form a basis of operators of definite quantum numbers . in the usual application of the variational technique , we find a basis of eigenvectors @xmath12 that diagonalizes the transfer matrix @xmath13 for @xmath14 for some @xmath15 close to the source , and determine the spectrum from the eigenvalues of @xmath16 at subsequent times .",
    "the method relies on constructing a basis of operators @xmath11 that provides a good description of the states of interest , and the remainder of this talk will focus on the construction of that basis .",
    "we classify the states of the continuum by their flavor structure , @xmath17 , and by their parity @xmath3 , total spin @xmath18 and `` helicity '' @xmath19 . whilst the flavor structure can be faithfully preserved in a lattice calculation ,",
    "the parity , spin and helicity labels arise from looking at the symmetry properties of states under rotations and reflections . in a lattice calculation",
    ", we have replaced continuum space time by a hypercubic lattice , and thus must classify states according to the irreducible representations @xmath20 of the cubic group ( for particles at rest ) ; the row @xmath21 within the representation is then the analogue of helicity .    in the following section",
    ", we will construct a set of elemental baryon operators @xmath22 having the correct flavor properties @xmath17 .",
    "we will then use group theory to generate a set of baryon operators @xmath23 that transform irreducibly under the rotation and reflection symmetries of the lattice , and from which we will construct our correlation matrix @xmath24 and hence extract the spectrum of states corresponding to @xmath25 .",
    "the color and flavor structure of the operators is dictated by the requirements of gauge invariance and of isospin respectively ; it is natural in a lattice calculation to assume exact isospin symmetry , and to classify states and operators by their isospin and strangeness , rather than according to @xmath26 flavor .",
    "the use of `` smearing '' has proven essential to reduce the coupling of operators to the higher excited states , and thus to ensure that the correlators eqn .",
    "[ eq : matrix_corr ] are dominated by only a few states even close to the source . in the example given here",
    ", we will adopt a gauge - covariant spatial laplacian to smear the fields : @xmath27 with the three - dimensional laplacian defined by @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes a link variable that can be smeared according to , say , the ape prescription@xcite . both @xmath30 and @xmath31",
    "are tunable parameters , and in the limit @xmath32 , eqn .",
    "[ eq : smear ] reduces to gaussian smearing of width @xmath31 .",
    "note that the square of the smeared field vanishes , in the manner of a simple grassmann field .",
    "an important consideration is to construct operators that enable us to build up the radial and orbital structure of the states .",
    "this is accomplished by additional powers of the laplacian , and by spatial derivatives , respectively , so that the quark building blocks become : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a flavor index , @xmath35 is a color index , @xmath36 a dirac spin index , and @xmath37 is an integer .",
    "the @xmath38-link gauge - covariant forward displacement operator is defined by @xmath39 where @xmath40 , and @xmath38 is an integer specifying the length of the displacement .    from these quark building blocks ,",
    "we construct our elemental three - quark operators : @xmath41 the flavor structure is specified by @xmath42 , whilst the levi - civita symbol ensures that these are color singlets .",
    "the radial and orbital structures are explored by varying @xmath43 , and through the choices of @xmath44 respectively",
    ". a large number of baryons can then be studied using a somewhat small number of quark propagator sources .",
    "proper rotations restricted to an isotropic cubic lattice form the cubic group @xmath45 .",
    "it has 24 elements , and five conjugacy classes and thus five single - valued irreducible representations : @xmath46 , of dimensions @xmath47 respectively .",
    "if we allow for spatial inversions , corresponding to @xmath48 , we obtain the group @xmath49 , and the irreducible representations acquire a further label , @xmath50 or @xmath51 , corresponding to positive and negative parity states , respectively .",
    "the construction of operators transforming irreducibly according to the single - valued representations is well known , and has been crucial to identifying the states in lattice calculations of the glueball spectrum .",
    "there are four two - dimensional spinorial representations of @xmath49 : @xmath52 , and two four - dimensional representatons , @xmath53@xcite .",
    "the irreducible representations @xmath18 of the continuum group @xmath54 are reducible under the cubic group @xmath45 ; the number of times @xmath55 that each of these reducible representations occurs in the irreducible representation @xmath56 of @xmath45 is shown in table  [ tab : subduction ] ; the extension to @xmath49 is straightforward .",
    ".the number of times @xmath55 that the irreducible representation @xmath56 of @xmath45 occurs in the reduction of the irreducible representation @xmath18 of @xmath54 . [ cols=\">,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     there are three embeddings of @xmath57 and a single embedding of @xmath58 , of both parities .",
    "this is in accord with expectations from an analysis of the continuum operators , where it is possible to construct three linearly independent nucleon interpolating currents@xcite , and a single spin-@xmath1 interpolating current .    the computation of the correlator matrix eqn .",
    "[ eq : corr_mat ] is straightforward .",
    "we compute the gauge - invariant `` generalised '' baryon correlator @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the quark propagator , whence @xmath61 where @xmath62 is obtained from @xmath63 by symmetrizing over @xmath36 and @xmath64 to account for the two possible wick contractions , and antisymmetrizing over @xmath65 and over @xmath66 to take account of the two terms in eqn .",
    "[ eq : phi ] .",
    "finally , we form the correlators @xmath67 where the @xmath68 are given in table  [ tab : results ] . while the computation of the generalized baryon correlators is computationally quite demanding , the subsequent calculation of the @xmath69 matrix of correlators of eqn .",
    "[ eq : corrs ] can be performed in a matter of minutes on a workstation , even for several hundred configurations .",
    "it is instructive to list some of the properties of the correlation matrix eqn .",
    "[ eq : corrs ] :    * cross - correlations between operators within different irreducible representations vanish . * cross - correlations between the operators of different rows within the same representation",
    "* the different rows within a representation can be chosen to have the same normalisation , so that correlators thus constructed have the same expectation values .",
    "* cross - correlations between the same row of different embeddings of the same irreducible representation _ do not vanish _ ; they can be constructed to vanish only on a particular time slice .",
    "thus the strategy for extracting the mass spectrum from the data is now clear .",
    "firstly , choose a particular irreducible representation , possibly averaging over the rows within that representation . then form the matrix of correlators between all the averaged operators within that representation , and extract the spectrum using , say , the method of eqn .",
    "[ eq : variation ] .",
    "the talk concludes with an examination of the correlators on an ensemble of lattice data , and in particular a verification of the properties above . to perform this study",
    ", we employ an ensemble of around 300 configurations computed on a @xmath70 lattice with @xmath71 flavors of asqtad staggered quarks having @xmath72@xcite .",
    "the lattice spacing @xmath73 is obtained from the 1p-1s splitting in the upsilon spectrum@xcite .",
    "we employ domain - wall fermions at a single mass @xmath74 for the valence quarks , which are computed on `` chopped '' @xmath75 lattices , with @xmath76 ; to reduce the residual mass , the configurations are first blocked using a non - perturbative hyp blocking scheme@xcite .",
    "smeared sources are used , using @xmath77 and @xmath78 in eqn .",
    "[ eq : smear ] , but local sinks , and thus the correlators are not positive definite ; full details of the calculation will appear in a subsequent paper  @xcite .",
    "+    the effective masses obtained from the diagonal correlators using the three embeddings of @xmath79 and @xmath80 are shown in figure  [ fig : g1_mass ] .",
    "the plot reveals a clear signal for both positive- and negative parity states from each of the three embeddings .",
    "note that the three usual baryon interpolating operators , for example in ref .",
    "@xcite , correspond to linear combinations of the operators used here ; the identification of a `` good '' baryon operator corresponding to the nucleon , and a baryon operator having a good overlap onto the roper resonance , should appear through the variational analysis .",
    "the effective masses for @xmath81 and @xmath82 are shown as the lower plot in figure  [ fig : g1_mass ] ; there is a clear separation from the mass of the ground - state nucleon , with the negative - parity state being lower in mass , as observed experimentally .",
    "we illustrate the orthogonality properties in two ways in figure  [ fig : orthog ] : firstly , by confirming that the cross - correlators between different irreducible representations are indeed zero , and secondly by verifying that those between different rows of the same irreducible representation vanish .",
    "the orthogonality properties are clearly well satisfied in these representative examples , indicating that the numerical implementation is under control .",
    "we have detailed the design of operators needed to determine the excited baryon spectrum .",
    "the method used to construct operators transforming irreducibly under the symmetries of the lattice has been outlined , and the efficacy of the method illustrated .",
    "the calculation of `` generalised '' baryon correlators followed by group - theory projections is computationally efficient , and allows straightforward identification of the quantum numbers of the correlators .",
