    "transport of reacting species advected by laminar or turbulent flows ( advection reaction diffusion  ard  systems ) , is an issue of obvious interest in many fields , e.g. population dynamics ( propagation of plankton in oceanic currents  @xcite ) , reacting chemicals in the atmosphere ( e.g. , ozone dynamics  @xcite ) , complex chemical reactions and combustion  @xcite . for recent interesting experimental studies",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the simplest non trivial case of ard is described by a scalar field @xmath0 , which represents the concentration of reaction products , such that @xmath1 is equal @xmath2 in the regions where the reaction is over ( the stable phase ) , and @xmath1 is zero where fresh material is present ( the unstable phase ) .",
    "the field @xmath0 evolves according to the following equation : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a given incompressible velocity field and @xmath5 is the molecular diffusion coefficient .",
    "of course the reaction is described by the term @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the time scale of the chemistry .",
    "the form of the reacting term @xmath8 depends on the problem under investigation ; a rather popular case is the so - called fisher - kolmogorov- petrovsky - piskunov ( fkpp ) nonlinearity  @xcite @xmath9 , which describes the auto - catalytic process @xmath10 ( in such a case @xmath1 is the concentration of the species @xmath11 ) .",
    "this nonlinearity belongs to the more general class of fkpp - type non - linearity characterized by having the maximum slope of @xmath8 in @xmath12 .",
    "those non - linearity terms give rise to the so called _ pulled _",
    "fronts for which front dynamics can be understood by linear analysis , since it is essentially determined by the @xmath13 region ( the front is pulled by its leading edge ) . in the case of front propagation in reaction - diffusion systems ( i.e. , with @xmath14 ) it is possible to show  @xcite that , for fkpp - like non linearity , a moving front ( i.e. , an `` invasion '' of the stable phase , @xmath15 , in the unstable one , @xmath16 ) develops with propagation speed given by @xmath17 .",
    "another important class of non - linearity terms is the non - fkpp - type , for which the maximal growth rate is not realized at @xmath12 but at some finite value of @xmath1 , where the details of the nonlinearity of @xmath8 are important . in this case",
    "front dynamics is often referred to as _ pushed _ , meaning that the front is pushed by its ( nonlinear ) interior . at variance with the previous case",
    ", the determination of the front speed now requires a detailed non linear analysis .",
    "it is not possible to give a general result for the front speed , but only the bound ( when @xmath18 ) @xmath19  @xcite can be obtained .",
    "an important example of non - fkpp - type non - linearity is given by the so called arrhenius term : @xmath20 .    in the following",
    "we principally adopt the fkpp - type nonlinearity .",
    "however , in order to investigate the relevance of @xmath8 , we also discuss the non fkpp - type nonlinearity .    if we suppress the reacting term @xmath6 in ( [ eq : ard ] ) we obtain the advection - diffusion equation which rules the evolution of the concentration @xmath21 of inert particles @xmath22 let us underline that for both the processes ( [ eq : ard ] ) and ( [ eq : ad ] ) ( reactive and inert transport , respectively ) , one can face different classes of problems , namely the asymptotic and non asymptotic ones  @xcite .    by asymptotic properties we mean the features of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ard ] ) and ( [ eq : ad ] ) at long times and large spatial scales , i.e. , much larger than the typical length @xmath23 of @xmath4 .",
    "in such a limit , under rather general conditions  @xcite , eq .",
    "( [ eq : ad ] ) reduces to an effective diffusion equation @xmath24 where the effective diffusion tensor @xmath25 depends , often in a nontrivial way , on @xmath4 . in a similar way for the ard problem",
    "if we start with a localized region in which @xmath15 ( elsewhere @xmath16 ) , one asymptotically has a front propagation with a front speed @xmath26 depending on @xmath7 , @xmath5 and @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "although the asymptotic problems are well defined from a mathematical viewpoint , sometimes their relevance in real life is rather poor .",
    "often , e.g. , in geophysics , the spatial size , @xmath27 , of the system is comparable with the typical length of the flow , @xmath23 , so it is not possible to use eq .",
    "( [ eq : deff ] ) for the dispersion of passive inert scalar fields and it is necessary to treat the problem using some indicators able to go beyond the diffusion coefficient .",
    "such a problem had been studied , for example , in refs .",
    "@xcite using the finite size lyapunov exponents which properly characterize the transport mechanism at a given ( spatial ) scale .",
    "+ in a similar way , considering cases with @xmath27 not too large compared with @xmath23 , one has nontrivial features also in ard systems . as an example we can mention ref .",
    "@xcite where it had been found that the burning efficiency in a closed domain does not increase for large values of the strength of the velocity field .    as a general remark",
    ", we stress that both in inertial and reactive transport the eulerian turbulence has a minor role . as examples we can mention the lagrangian chaos , i.e. , the irregular behavior of passive tracers also for laminar flow  @xcite and the poor role of the presence of small scales in the velocity field for front propagation  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the mixing and reaction efficiency [ in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ad ] ) and  ( [ eq : ard ] ) , respectively ] in systems advected by a given velocity field , @xmath4 , in closed domains . for mixing efficiency",
    "we intend the capacity of a flow to spread particulate inert material starting from a small region over the whole system domain .",
    "when the material is chemically active , the interesting question concerns the times needed to complete the reaction in the system domain , that we call reaction efficiency . at an intuitive level one could expect a link between mixing and reaction efficiency , because both are related to the transport properties of the velocity field , but we show there exist cases in which this relation is very weak .",
    "we will see that for the inert transport problem ( [ eq : ad ] ) , the mixing efficiency strongly depends on the features of the dynamical system @xmath28 in particular if large scale chaos is present or not . on the contrary for the reacting case ( [ eq : ard ] ) , the presence of large - scale chaos has a minor role .",
    "this result is rather close to those obtained in other subtle issues such as the classical limit of quantum mechanics  @xcite , or metastable balance between chaos and diffusion  @xcite .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we introduce two flow models for the velocity field * u * and we discuss the mixing efficiency ( for inert particles ) in closed domains at varying the chaotic properties of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ds ] ) .",

    "when molecular diffusion is present , we have to consider the langevin equation obtained by adding a noisy term to ( [ eq : ds ] ) @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a white noise . therefore , eq .  ( [ eq : ad ] ) is nothing but the fokker - planck equation related to ( [ eq : la ] ) .",
    "+ since we are interested in the mixing in closed domains @xmath32 , we have to specify the boundary conditions : in the case @xmath29 the perpendicular component of @xmath4 on the border @xmath33 must be zero . in @xmath34",

    "analogous in the case @xmath38 is the no - flux condition @xmath39 . in terms of the langevin equation ( [ eq : la ] )",
    "this corresponds to a reflection of the trajectory @xmath40 on @xmath33 .    in the following",
    "we will limit our attention to @xmath34 cases , i.e. , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is time - periodic function of period @xmath43 .",
    "first we analyze the case of @xmath29 . if @xmath44 , eq . ( [ eq : ds ] ) can not exhibit a chaotic behavior . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath45 one can have chaos ( and this is the typical feature ) around the separatrix ( periodic orbit of infinite period ) . at small @xmath46 chaos",
    "is restricted to a limited region and it has just a poor role for the mixing in @xmath32 . in order to have `` large - scale '' chaotic mixing ( i.e. , the possibility to cross the unperturbed separatrix ) @xmath46 must be larger than a certain critical value @xmath47 ( which depends on @xmath43 ) .",
    "this is the essence of the celebrated `` overlap of the resonances criterion '' by chirikov  @xcite .",
    "+ it is easy to realize that , if @xmath48 , after a sufficiently long time , tracers will invade the whole basin , i.e. , there will be no more barriers to transport .",
    "the interesting question in such a case is to understand the mechanism which determines the mixing time , i.e. , the time to have a spatial homogenization due to the mixing process .",
    "+ consider as initial condition a distribution @xmath49 localized around @xmath50 : in lagrangian terms an ensemble of particles initially concentrated in a small region of size @xmath51 .",
    "there are two limit cases in which it is simple to understand the local transport properties , namely for very large scale @xmath52 , i.e. , @xmath53 , and for very small scales , i.e. , @xmath54 .",

    "we have performed a numerical study of advection - reaction - diffusion systems confined in a closed domain and stirred by two different laminar velocities . both the velocity fields can generate a regular or a chaotic lagrangian dynamics , at varying control parameters . for the mixing properties of inert particles we observed that , when the dynamics is strongly chaotic , mixing times weakly depend on molecular diffusion ; this feature becomes much more notable when the velocity field * u * is not strong enough to avoid the creation of recirculation regions .",
    "then , switching on the reaction term , we analyze the burning time of a reactive scalar in the same flows .",
    "the principal result of our study is that , while the mixing properties of the flows can change very much with varying dynamical properties , on the contrary the burning efficiency does not vary so much .",
    "we have also shown cases exist in which the burning efficiency is not strictly related to the mixing properties of the flows .",
