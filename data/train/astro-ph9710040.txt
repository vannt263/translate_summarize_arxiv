    "in the pn phase , stars more massive than solar return to the ism material that has been processed in the stellar interior . this matter mixes with the surrounding medium and modifies the original abundances of elements .",
    "the contribution of pne to the galactic chemical evolution is particularly important for @xmath2he which , together with deuterium ( d ) , plays a fundamental role in testing the standard big bang nucleosynthesis model . while the evolution of d is well understood , that of @xmath2he still encounters serious problems which cast doubts on the usefulness of this isotope as a test of big bang nucleosynthesis models ( e.g. galli et al .",
    "in fact , observations of @xmath2he toward pne and hii regions give values of the abundance that differ by almost two orders of magnitude : [ @xmath2he / h]@xmath5 in pne and @xmath6 in hii regions and in the solar system . however , the abundance in pne is exactly that predicted by standard stellar evolution models for stars of mass 1 - 1.5 m@xmath7 .",
    "the main question is then : if low mass stars produce a lot of @xmath2he and return it to the ism during the pn ",
    "phase , why do nt we see it at a level much higher than observed in hii regions and the solar system as all standard galactic evolutionary models predict ?",
    "possible solutions to this question have been extensively discussed in this workshop ( cf .",
    "the reviews by tosi and by charbonnel ) .",
    "the most interesting suggestions invoke the existence of nonstandard mixing mechanisms which operate during the red giant phase of stars with m@xmath8   m@xmath7 .",
    "if such mechanisms are indeed at work , an unavoidable consequence is that the ratio of @xmath0c/@xmath1c in pn ejecta should be much _ lower _ than in the standard case . for a 1 m@xmath7 star ,",
    "the predicted ratio is about 5 against the standard value of 2530 ( charbonnel 1995 ; sackmann & boothroyd 1997 ) .",
    "therefore , it is very important to have a precise measure of the isotopic ratios in those pne where the @xmath2he abundance has been determined .",
    "should these stars show a @xmath0c/@xmath1c ratio close to 2530 , then no modifications to the standard stellar models would be required .",
    "otherwise , one has to invoke another selective process ( mixing , diffusion etc . ) that operates on some isotopes but not on @xmath2he .",
    "however , the number of pne with @xmath2he measurements is small ( see rood this volume ) , whereas the suggested physical processes should be quite general and should affect the nucleosynthetic yields of all stars of mass less than @xmath9  m@xmath7 .",
    "thus , the interest of measuring the carbon isotopic ratio in a sample of pne as large as possible . in this contribution",
    ", we present the initial results of such a study .",
    "molecular line observations at mm - wavelengths provide the most powerful method to estimate the @xmath0c/@xmath1c ratio in pne . in particular , the @xmath0co/@xmath1co ratio should faithfully reflect the atomic @xmath0c/@xmath1c ratio , since the mechanisms which could alter the @xmath0co/@xmath1co ratio are not expected to be at work in pne . namely , ( i ) the kinetic temperatures in pn envelopes ( 2550 k ) is high enough that the isotopic fractionation should not operate , and ( ii ) selective photodissociation is expected to be compensated by the isotope change reaction @xmath0co+@xmath1c@xmath10co+c@xmath3 which is faster than the @xmath1co photodestruction in pn envelopes ( e.g. likkel et al .",
    "however , although the j=10 and j=21 lines of @xmath0co have been extensively observed in pne ( e.g. huggins et al . 1996 ) , very few observations of the @xmath1co lines are available and the value of the isotopic ratio is presently unknown .",
    "our project consists of two steps . in the first one , we have carried out high quality observations of @xmath0co and @xmath1co in six pne where the @xmath2he abundance is known from the observations of rood and collaborators . in the second step",
    ", a larger sample of nebulae with strong @xmath0co line emission has been observed in @xmath1co lines in order to determine the isotopic ratio in pne _ without _ @xmath2he measurements .",
    "galli et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have argued that extra - mixing processes need not to be at work in _ all _ low - mass stars in order to reconcile the predictions of the galactic evolution of @xmath2he with the observational constraints : acceptable results are obtained if about 70%-80% of stars with mass lower than 2 m@xmath7 undergo extra mixing .",
    "this suggestion can be tested by determining the isotopic ratio in a statistically significant sample of pne .",
    "we have observed the six pne studied by balser et al .",
    "( 1997 ) with the iram 30-m telescope in an observing run in november 1996 .",
    "the observations were made in the j=21 and j=10 lines of @xmath0co and @xmath1co , simultaneously .",
    "bachiller et al . (",
    "1993 ) have shown that pne shells are characterized by an intrinsic co ( 21)/(10 ) line ratio in the range 25 , indicating that the j=21 line is more effective for co searches .",
    "the results of the observations are given in table  1 with the pn name , the distance , mass , the @xmath2he number abundance ( given by balser et al .",
    "1997 ) , the intensities i@xmath11 of the j=21 lines and the carbon isotopic ratio . with the exception of ngc  6720 ,",
    "the values of i@xmath11 represent upper limits to the intensity and have been estimated from the line widths deduced from the expansion velocities listed in the catalog of acker et al .",
    "( 1992 ) .",
    "disappointingly enough , this sample of pne shows little emission in co : the main and isotopic lines have been firmly detected only in ngc  6720 .",
    "bachiller et al . (",
    "1989 ) had already detected carbon monoxide emission in this object and the emission showed a kind of clumpy ring , resembling the optical appearance of the nebula .",
    "we have observed in @xmath1co the most prominent clumps ( three positions ) and detected emission in all cases .",
    "thus , the present data allow to produce a map of the isotopic ratio across the nebula .",
    "the resulting value of @xmath0c/@xmath1c=22 is in agreement with a previous estimate of bachiller et al .",
    "unfortunately , ngc  6720 has an estimated progenitor mass of @xmath122 m@xmath7 , at the borderline of the mass range where the nonstandard mixing mechanism is expected to significantly decrease the isotopic ratio .",
    "thus , the derived ratio is consistent with both standard and nonstandard evolutionary models .",
    "we also detected a line around the @xmath0co j=10 frequency in the central position of ngc  6543 , but we failed to detect the j=21 line at relatively low levels .",
    "this indicates that the line near the j=10 frequency is probably not due to co. it is interesting to recall that the h38@xmath13 recombination line is only separated by 3 mhz ( 7.8 km / s ) from the @xmath0co j=10 line . as discussed in bachiller et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , the h38@xmath13 line can dominate the emission around the @xmath0co j=10 frequency in some nebulae with little or no molecular gas .",
    "we believe that this is the case in the central position of ngc  6543 .    following the discussion of rood ( this volume ) , the best object for testing the mixing hypothesis is ngc  3242 where the @xmath2he measurements are the most reliable ones _ and",
    "_ the progenitor mass is sufficiently small ( @xmath121.2 m@xmath7 ) that the predicted isotopic ratio should be about 10 ( instead of @xmath1230 ) .",
    "however , the excellent signal to noise ratio of our observations and the fact that we searched for co emission across the whole circumstellar shell imply that co is really absent in the nebula .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the isotopic ratio can not be determined in this important object with millimeter line observations .",
    ".distances , progenitor masses and abundances [ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]",
    "it is a pleasure to thank r. rood , t. bania and d. balser for numerous and fruitful discussions on the @xmath2he measurements .",
    "this work is done in collaboration with m. tosi and l. stanghellini ."
