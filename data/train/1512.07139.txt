    ", because of larger variance is than mean . to model such situations standard models like poisson , negative binomial , geometric distribution are not enough , which makes researchers to generalize , extend or modify these standard models preserving the fundamental properties like uni modality , log concavity , infinite divisibility , over dispersion(under dispersion ) of standard distributions .",
    "some of such generalization you can find in jain and consul(1971 ) , philippou and georghiou(1983 ) , tripahti et al.(1987 ) .",

    "many generalization of geometric distribution have been appear in the literature using mainly three methodology , ( i ) discretizing the continuous distribution ( ii ) mixed poisson(mixing poisson parameter with continuous distribution ) methodology and ( iii ) taking discrete analogue of continuous distribution over real line.(see definition ( ) in section ) .",
    "connection of many generalized geometric distributions obtained by utilizing these three methods have been briefly presented in figure 1,2 and 3 .                in this article",
    "we propose another generalization of _ `` geometric distribution '' _ and possessing many properties like , unimodality , log concavity , infinite divisibility , closed form of moments estimator and estimator obtained using proportion of zeros and mean .",
    "moreover the proposed distribution can also be viewed as discrete analogue of weighted exponential distribution by gupta and kundu(2009 ) and weighted version of geometric distribution ( see patil and rao(1977 , 1978 ) , rao(1985 ) ) , in fact we proposed our distribution using the later .",
    "the weight function proposed in this paper is @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the shape parameter the parameter @xmath2 comes from the definition of geometric distribution .",
