    "to understand the properties of many of the recently discovered superconductors@xcite , a multi - band description , which is often tied to the existence of multiple orbital degrees of freedom , is essential .",
    "taking into account several fermi surfaces does not only yield quantitative corrections , but also makes qualitatively different concepts possible such as pairing states that have no analogue in a single - band picture .",
    "one famous example is the @xmath0 state that has been proposed , e.g. , in the iron - based superconductors@xcite and earlier in other systems@xcite .",
    "while the pairing field is constant on a given fermi surface , it changes sign between the electron and hole band .",
    "the identification of a pairing state and mechanism constitutes a challenging task , in particular , in a multi - band system .",
    "the behavior of superconductivity under the influence of different types of disorder can give important hints about the order parameter and pairing glue . in case of conventional @xmath1-wave superconductivity ,",
    "the transition temperature is only very weakly affected by the presence of nonmagnetic impurities except for very strong disorder where the mean - free path @xmath2 is comparable to or smaller than the fermi wavelength @xmath3 .",
    "this is usually referred to as the anderson theorem@xcite .",
    "when magnetic impurities are considered , the transition temperature is suppressed@xcite and vanishes when @xmath2 becomes of the order of the superconducting coherence length @xmath4 even when @xmath5 . since various unconventional pairing states",
    "have been shown@xcite to be strongly suppressed already by nonmagnetic impurities , the sensitivity of the transition temperature to nonmagnetic disorder is commonly used as an indication of unconventional pairing .",
    "unconventional superconductivity is thus expected to occur only in very clean systems .",
    "however , several studies@xcite of both magnetic and nonmagnetic disorder have revealed that , in some cases , unconventional superconductors can be much more robust than naively expected or even enjoy an analogue of the anderson theorem .",
    "refs .   and",
    "indicate that it is essential to take into account all characteristic details of the system , such as multiple orbitals and spin - orbit coupling , in order to judge reliably the robustness of unconventional superconductors in the presence of disorder . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", it then becomes more difficult to find an approach that captures the essential features but leads to results that are universal in the sense that they do not depend on irrelevant microscopic details .",
    "one example of a recently discovered superconducting@xcite system where the multi - orbital character@xcite , spin - orbit coupling@xcite as well as strongly anisotropic effective masses@xcite seem to be crucial for understanding its properties is provided by the two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron liquid that forms@xcite at the interface between the insulators laalo@xmath6 ( lao ) and srtio@xmath6 ( sto ) . in ref .",
    ", two possible pairing states have been proposed for this system .",
    "if superconductivity arises as a consequence of conventional electron - phonon coupling , the pairing field will have the same sign on both spin - orbit split fermi surfaces . in case of an unconventional , i.e. , purely electronic , pairing mechanism ,",
    "the order parameter has opposite signs on the two fermi surfaces . despite the similarities to the @xmath0 state known from the iron - based superconductors ,",
    "there is one main crucial difference .",
    "the fermi surfaces in lao / sto interfaces are singly degenerate due to the combination of broken inversion symmetry and spin - orbit coupling which has important consequences for superconductivity ( see also , e.g. , refs .  ) .",
    "for example , the unconventional pairing state proposed@xcite for oxide interfaces has been shown to be a time - reversal invariant topological superconductor which is intimately related to the fermi surfaces being split by spin - orbit coupling .",
    "consequently , it constitutes an important open question whether such an exciting new state of matter is indeed realized in oxide interfaces .",
    "an analysis of the impact of disorder on the superconducting states proposed in ref .   is thus required .",
    "it is particularly important to perform a quantitative analysis beyond a simple one - orbital toy model calculation since experimental estimates of the coherence length@xcite @xmath7 and the mean - free path@xcite @xmath8 are of the same order .    in this paper , we consider impurity scattering in superconducting lao / sto interfaces using a two - band model that captures the multi - orbital character , the spin - orbit splitting as well as the anisotropy of the masses .",
    "the resulting highly non - circular form of the fermi surfaces and anisotropic textures of the wavefunctions are conveniently taken into account by introducing patches in the nested regions of the fermi surfaces . due to the strong anisotropy , the wavefunctions are approximately constant within each patch yielding results that only depend on a small set of parameters .",
    "we find that the spin and orbital polarization of the states at the fermi surfaces enhances the stability of both the conventional and unconventional superconducting phase against impurity scattering .",
    "furthermore , contrary to common wisdom , the unconventional superconductor is found to be , by a factor of two , more robust against magnetic scattering than the conventional condensate .",
