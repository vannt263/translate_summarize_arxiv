    "in the recent years , observation of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy has been greatly improved . after the discovery of the cmb anisotropy by cobe @xcite at the angular scale @xmath1 , there have been many efforts to improve the measurements . in particular , recent balloon and ground - based experiments observed the cmb anisotropy at smaller angular scale of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "then , the observation of the cmb anisotropy is expected to be greatly improved by the on - going and future satellite experiments , map @xcite and planck @xcite ; after these experiments , the cmb angular power spectrum @xmath3 will be determined at @xmath4 level up to the multipole @xmath5 .    with these measurements , our understanding of the evolution of the universe is also being improved .",
    "importantly , since the cmb power spectrum is sensitive to origins and evolutions of the cosmic density perturbations ( as well as to the cosmological parameters ) , we are now able to constrain scenarios of generating the cosmic density perturbations .    among various scenarios , inflation",
    "@xcite is probably the most popular and well - motivated one to provide the source of the cosmic density perturbations . in the simplest case ,",
    "all the components in the universe ( other than the cosmological constant ) , like the photon , baryon , cold dark matter ( cdm ) , and so on , originate to decay products of the inflaton field @xmath6 which is the scalar field responsible for the inflation .",
    "the inflaton field fluctuates during the inflation and it becomes the source of the cosmic density perturbations .",
    "one of the most important consequences of such a scenario is that , since all the components in the universe are produced from the inflaton field , there is no entropy perturbation between any of two components and hence the density fluctuations become adiabatic .",
    "importantly , assuming the standard evolution of the universe after the inflation and using a reasonable set of the cosmological parameters , it is now widely believed that the observed cmb power spectrum is consistent with the one predicted from the scale - invariant spectrum which can arise from some class of inflation models @xcite .    from the particle - physics point of view",
    ", however , the simplest scenario may not be the case and there exist possible sources of the cosmic density perturbations other than the inflaton field .",
    "in particular , in various scenarios , light scalar fields are introduced which dominate the universe at early epochs .",
    "( we denote such a scalar field as @xmath0 . ) for example , in the scenario of affleck - dine baryogenesis @xcite , condensation of the squark and slepton fields is converted to the baryon - number asymmetry of the universe .",
    "if this is the case , there may exist an epoch when the universe is dominated by the affleck - dine field .",
    "then , at the time of the decay of the affleck - dine field , the late - time entropy production occurs .",
    "other candidate is flat directions in the theory space . in particular , in the superstring theory @xcite , there are various flat directions parameterized by scalar fields called moduli fields .",
    "such moduli fields are expected to acquire masses from the effect of the supersymmetry breaking and hence their masses can be much lighter than the planck scale . if the initial amplitudes of the moduli fields are large , the universe is once dominated by the moduli field and is reheated at the time of the decay of the moduli fields .",
    "( see refs .",
    "@xcite for the scenario with cosmological moduli fields . ) in addition , in refs .",
    "@xcite it is pointed out that the baryon - number asymmetry of the universe can be explained if the universe was once dominated by the condensation of the right - handed scalar neutrino . in this case , the universe also experiences the late - time entropy production .",
    "in addition , axion - like scalar field is proposed as a seed of the cosmic density perturbations @xcite in the pre - big - bang @xcite and the ekpyrotic @xcite scenarios .",
    "such scalar fields may acquire fluctuations of the amplitude in the early universe ( in particular , during the inflation ) .",
    "then , the scalar field eventually decays and reheats the universe .",
    "importantly , in this class of scenario , the cmb radiation we observe today originates to @xmath0 rather than to the inflaton . as a result",
    ", one can expect that the fluctuation of the scalar - field amplitude affects the cosmic density perturbations @xcite .",
    "in particular , in such a scenario , adiabatic and isocurvature perturbations may be generated with cross-correlation.for other mechanisms of generating correlated mixture of the adiabatic and isocurvature perturbations , see @xcite .",
    "indeed , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the cmb angular power spectrum is calculated in such a framework , and it was shown that effects of the correlated isocurvature perturbation may be large enough to be seen in the on - going and future experiments .",
    "in addition , it is possible that the dominant part of the cosmic density perturbations observed today may originate to the primordial perturbation in the amplitude of @xmath0 rather than to the fluctuation of the inflaton amplitude .",
    "( this kind of mechanism is sometimes called `` curvaton mechanism . '' )    in this paper , we consider effects of such scalar - field condensations to the cosmic density perturbations without relying on any particular scenarios . assuming that the universe was once dominated by the scalar - field condensation and that the reheating occurred at a later stage with generating large amount of entropy , we study the evolutions of the cosmic density perturbations and consider the cmb angular power spectrum . as we will see , the cmb power spectrum can be affected in various ways depending on scenarios .",
    "interestingly , if the decay product of the @xmath0 field does not generate the baryon asymmetry or the cdm component , then the adiabatic and isocurvature perturbations can be both generated with cross - correlation . in this case , the cmb power spectrum may significantly change its behavior from the adiabatic result .",
    "in particular , the simple `` curvaton '' scenario , in which the cosmic density perturbations are generated only from the primordial fluctuation of the amplitude of @xmath0 , is severely constrained by the current observations of the cmb angular power spectrum _",
    "if the adiabatic and isocurvature perturbations are generated with cross - correlation_.    the organization of the rest of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : scenario ] , we introduce the scenario we consider and follow the thermal history of the universe .",
    "evolutions of the cosmic density perturbations in such a scenario is discussed in section [ sec : evolution ] . in particular , it is discussed how the density perturbation in the radiation is affected by the primordial fluctuation of the amplitude of @xmath0 . then , in section [ sec : cl ] , we overview the behavior of the cmb anisotropy in our scenario .",
    "detailed discussions on the cmb power spectrum for the cases with and without the isocurvature perturbations are given in sections [ sec : noentropy ] and [ sec : entropy ] , respectively .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] is devoted for the conclusion .",
    "let us first introduce the scenario we have in mind . in this paper , we consider the thermal history with late - time entropy production which is due to the decay of the scalar field @xmath0 .    for our study , it is important to understand the behavior of the scalar field in the expanding universe .",
    "for this purpose , we start with the lagrangian of the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the potential of the scalar field . in our discussion , we adopt the parabolic potential for the scalar field ; @xmath9 from this lagrangian , we can derive the energy density @xmath10 and the pressure @xmath11 of the scalar field condensation ; for the zero - mode , we obtain @xmath12 where the `` dot '' denotes the derivative with respect to time @xmath13 .",
    "in addition , in the expanding universe , equation of motion of the scalar field is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the expansion rate with @xmath16 being the scale factor .",
    "the behavior of @xmath0 depends on the relative size of the expansion rate @xmath17 and the scalar mass @xmath18 . when the expansion rate is much larger than @xmath18 , the second term , which plays the role of the friction term , is significant and @xmath19 ( almost ) vanishes . in this case ,",
    "change of the scalar amplitude can be neglected and @xmath0 takes a constant value .",
    "we call this epoch as `` slow - roll '' epoch since @xmath19 is negligibly small . on the contrary ,",
    "when @xmath20 , the scalar field oscillates around the minimum of the potential .",
    "in particular , when @xmath21 , the oscillation of the scalar field becomes fast enough so that the relation @xmath22 holds , where @xmath23 denotes the average over the time scale much longer than @xmath24 ( but shorter than @xmath25 ) . with this relation , the energy density and the pressure of the scalar field",
    "are given as @xmath26 as we can see , the pressure of the scalar field effectively vanishes at this epoch and the equation - of - state parameter for the scalar field becomes @xmath27 . in this case",
    ", the energy density of the scalar field behaves as that of the non - relativistic component .",
    "consequently , when @xmath28 ( with @xmath29 being the decay rate of @xmath0 ) , @xmath10 decreases as @xmath30 .",
    "now we discuss the thermal history of the universe with the scalar field @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , we consider the case where the initial amplitude of the scalar field @xmath31 is non - vanishing so that @xmath0 may become cosmologically significant .",
    "with such an initial condition , let us follow the evolution of the universe starting with the inflationary period .",
    "as in the conventional cases , we adopt the epoch of ( slow - roll ) inflation in the early stage . as well as solving the horizon and flatness problems , inflation provides the source of the cosmic density perturbations .",
    "we assume that the mass of the scalar field @xmath0 is much smaller than the expansion rate of the universe during the inflation @xmath32 .",
    "if this is the case , the energy density of the scalar field is much smaller than the total energy density of the universe as far as the amplitude of the scalar field is smaller than the planck scale .",
    "then , the potential of the scalar field @xmath0 is effectively flat during inflation and there is no strong reason to have vanishing initial amplitude of @xmath0.if the minimum of the potential of @xmath0 is a symmetry - enhanced point , however , initial value of @xmath0 may vanish @xcite .",
    "in addition , if @xmath33 , @xmath0 is slow - rolling during inflation and it keeps its initial amplitude .",
    "thus , we assume a non - vanishing value of the initial amplitude @xmath31 .    in the slow - roll inflation models , the inflaton field @xmath6 oscillates after the inflation and decays .",
    "then , the universe is reheated .",
    "( we call this epoch as the `` first reheating '' since , in the scenarios we consider , the universe is reheated again due to the decay of @xmath0 . )",
    "the energy density of the inflaton field also decreases as @xmath30 in this oscillating period , and hence the expansion rate of the universe is being decreased .",
    "then , at the time when the expansion rate of the universe becomes comparable to the decay rate of the inflaton @xmath34 , the inflaton decays and reheats the universe . equating the expansion rate and the decay rate of the inflaton field ,",
    "the reheating temperature is estimated to be @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the effective number of the massless degrees of freedom , in this section , we neglect the temperature dependence of @xmath37 since it does not significantly change the following discussion .",
    "@xmath38 is the reduced planck scale , and we adopt the approximation of the instantaneous reheating at the time of @xmath39 . in addition , here ( and in the following order - of - estimations in this section ) , we neglect numerical constants of @xmath40 .",
    "evolution of the scalar field @xmath0 depends on the relative size of @xmath18 and @xmath34 .",
    "if the mass @xmath18 is smaller than @xmath34 , @xmath0 starts its oscillation after the decay of the inflaton ; otherwise , @xmath0 starts to move while the inflaton field is still oscillating . in studying the thermal history with the scalar field @xmath0 , it is also important to specify the initial value of the scalar field @xmath31 .",
    "when @xmath0 starts to move , @xmath41 and hence the total energy density of the universe is @xmath42 .",
    "thus , if @xmath31 is smaller than @xmath43 , the scalar field is a sub - dominant component when it starts to move , and hence the evolution of the universe at this epoch is controlled by other components , oscillating inflaton field or radiation . if @xmath44 , on the contrary , energy density of @xmath0 becomes comparable to the total energy density . in this case , the scalar field @xmath0 never becomes minor component until it decays .",
    "let us first consider the case where @xmath45 is high enough so that @xmath0 starts to oscillate after the decay of the inflaton .",
    "this happens when @xmath46 . in this case , the scalar field starts to oscillate at the temperature @xmath47 after this epoch , the energy density of the scalar field @xmath10 decreases as @xmath30 while that of radiation is proportional to @xmath48 , and hence the energy density of the scalar field decreases slower than that of the radiation .",
    "thus , when the amplitude of the scalar field is as large as @xmath49 , the energy density of the scalar field becomes comparable to that of radiation if the scalar field does not decay before this epoch .",
    "expansion rate at this epoch is @xmath50 , and @xmath51 becomes larger than the decay rate of @xmath0 if @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the reheating temperature after the decay of @xmath0 and is estimated as @xmath54 if the condition ( [ phimin ] ) is satisfied , the scalar field dominates the universe before it decays .",
    "if the reheating temperature after the inflation @xmath45 becomes low , the scalar field @xmath0 may start to oscillate before the inflaton field decays ; this is the case if @xmath55 . in this case ,",
    "when the inflaton field decays , the amplitude of the scalar field is @xmath56 .",
    "then , the energy densities of @xmath0 and radiation become comparable when @xmath57 , if @xmath0 does not decay before its amplitude becomes smaller than this value .",
    "then , the condition to have a @xmath0-dominated epoch is @xmath58    if the initial amplitude of @xmath0 becomes larger than @xmath59 , on the other hand , the @xmath0 field slow - rolls even after the expansion rate of the universe becomes comparable to @xmath18 .",
    "then , the universe enters into the de sitter phase again . in this case",
    ", @xmath0 plays the role of the inflaton and the resultant cosmic density perturbation becomes the same as the standard adiabatic result ( if the scale of the secondary inflation is properly chosen).if the @xmath60-folding number due to the secondary inflation is small , however , this is not the case and the cosmic density fluctuation for large scale is generated by the first inflation .",
    "we do not consider such a case in this paper .",
    "thus , we assume that the initial amplitude of @xmath0 is smaller than @xmath43 .",
    "in particular , we assume that @xmath31 is small enough so that the universe has a radiation - dominated epoch before @xmath0 dominates the universe .",
    "( this is the case if @xmath31 is substantially smaller than @xmath43 . )    in fig .",
    "[ fig : phimin ] , we summarize the above results ; on the @xmath53 vs.  @xmath18 plane , we plot the contours of the minimum value of @xmath31 with which the universe experiences the @xmath0-dominated epoch . in the following discussion",
    ", we assume that the initial amplitude of the scalar field is large enough so that there exists the @xmath0-dominated epoch .    since the universe has to follow the standard big - bang scenario in particular for the big - bang nucleosynthesis , however , the universe has to become radiation - dominated after the @xmath0-dominated epoch .",
    "this is realized by the reheating due to the decay of @xmath0 .",
    "when @xmath61 , the @xmath0 field decays and its energy density is converted to that of radiation . the reheating temperature at the time of the @xmath0-decay depends on the decay rate @xmath29",
    "importantly , the reheating temperature has to be higher than @xmath62 so that the success of the standard big - bang nucleosynthesis is not altered ; we assume that @xmath29 is large enough in order not to affect the standard nucleosynthesis scenario .    in summary ,",
    "the thermal history is as follows :    * in the early stage , inflation occurs . for the pre - big - bang @xcite and the ekpyrotic @xcite scenarios",
    ", this may not be the case . in these cases , we assume that some other mechanism generates the primordial fluctuation of @xmath0 . during inflation ,",
    "the scalar field @xmath0 has a substantial initial amplitude so that it dominates the universe at the later stage .",
    "* after the inflation , the universe is dominated by the oscillating inflaton field .",
    "( we call this epoch as `` @xmath6d '' epoch . ) at some point , the inflaton decays and reheats the universe .",
    "* when the expansion rate of the universe becomes comparable to @xmath18 , the @xmath0 field starts to oscillate .",
    "this may happen during the @xmath6d or the radiation - dominated epoch .",
    "we assume that the initial amplitude of @xmath0 is smaller than @xmath63 so that there is no inflation induced by the @xmath0 field .",
    "in addition , if @xmath31 is substantially smaller than @xmath43 , the universe experiences a radiation - dominated epoch before @xmath0 dominates the universe .",
    "( we call this epoch as `` rd1 '' epoch . ) * as the universe expands , @xmath0 eventually dominates the universe since @xmath64 while @xmath65 ( where @xmath66 is the energy density of radiation ) .",
    "we call this epoch `` @xmath0d '' epoch . *",
    "when @xmath67 , the @xmath0 field decays and reheats the universe . then the radiation - dominated universe is realized again .",
    "( we call this epoch `` rd2 '' epoch . ) after this epoch , the evolution of the universe is the same as the standard big - bang case as far as the cosmic density perturbations are not concerned .",
    "the scenario is schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : history ] .",
    "( in the following , the subscripts `` @xmath6d , '' `` rd1 , '' `` @xmath0d , '' and `` rd2 '' will be used for variables in each epochs . )",
    "in the previous section , we summarized the scenario and discussed the evolutions of the background variables ( i.e. , the zero - modes ) .",
    "our purpose is , however , to understand the effects of the fluctuation of the amplitude of the scalar field @xmath0 on the cosmic density perturbations .",

    "in addition , @xmath83 is the comoving momentum , @xmath84 the equation - of - state parameter for the total matter , and @xmath85    as indicated in the above equations , evolutions of the metric perturbations are related to those of the density , velocity , and other perturbations of various components . here , we consider the universe with temperature higher than @xmath86 . in such a situation ,",
    "various charged particles become relativistic and are thermally produced .",
    "then , all the relativistic components ( like photon , electron , quarks , neutrinos , and so on ) can be regarded as a single fluid with very short mean free path , much shorter than the horizon scale .",
    "we call such a component as `` radiation '' and use the subscript `` @xmath87 '' for it .",
    "when the mean free path of the radiation is very short , perturbation of the radiation becomes locally isotropic and the anisotropic stress perturbation vanishes : @xmath88 then , the equations for the density and velocity perturbations of the radiation are given by @xmath89 where the `` prime '' denotes the derivative with respect to the conformal time @xmath75 .",
    "in addition , if a very weakly interacting non - relativistic component exists , its perturbations obey the following equations : @xmath90 where the subscript `` @xmath91 '' is for non - relativistic matters .",
    "notice that , when a scalar field is oscillating , the equation - of - state parameter of the scalar condensation vanishes and hence the density and velocity perturbations of the scalar field also obey eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cdm ] ) and ( [ eq : cdm_velocity ] ) .    in our scenario",
    ", there are several possible sources of the density perturbations .",
    "the first one is , as in the conventional case , fluctuation of the inflaton amplitude . in our case , however , amplitude of @xmath0 may also fluctuate and such a fluctuation becomes second source of the density fluctuations .",
    "in addition , if there exists independent scalar field ( called @xmath92 ) from which the baryon or the cdm is generated , we also have to take account of its effects .",
    "( in the following , we consider the cases with and without this scalar field @xmath92 . ) in the following , primordial fluctuations of these scalar fields are assumed to be uncorrelated . in the framework of the linear perturbation theory , evolutions of the perturbations from the primordial fluctuations of these scalar fields are independent and hence we can study their evolutions separately .",
    "evolutions of the perturbations from the inflaton fluctuation are intensively studied ; such a fluctuation provides adiabatic density fluctuations .",
    "in addition , density perturbation induced from the fluctuation of @xmath92 is also well known as far as @xmath92 is a minor component in the rd2 epoch ; primordial fluctuation of @xmath92 induces ( purely ) isocurvature fluctuation to the baryonic or the cdm component .",
    "thus , in the following , we study the evolutions of the density perturbations induced by the fluctuation of the amplitude of @xmath0 . for this purpose",
    ", we decompose the scalar field as @xmath93 where @xmath94 denotes the fluctuation of @xmath0 .",
    "( we use the same notation for the total amplitude and for the zero - mode because we believe there is no confusion . )",
    "in particular we study evolutions in very early universe in order to understand how the fluctuations behave when the universe enters into the rd2 epoch . in realistic scenarios ,",
    "the scale we are interested in ( i.e. , the scale corresponding to the multipole @xmath95 ) is far outside of the horizon at this epoch and hence we can expand the solutions to the equations as functions of @xmath96 .",

    "we can also consider the case where the cdm sector has correlated and uncorrelated entropy perturbations ( i.e. , the case with @xmath252 and @xmath224 ) .",
    "importantly , correlated and uncorrelated entropy perturbations both suppress the angular power spectrum at high multipole relative to the low one .",
    "thus , in this case , too large @xmath214 is always excluded irrespective of the value of @xmath220 if the baryon is from the decay product of @xmath0 .",
    "in this paper , we discussed the effects of the late - time entropy production due to the decay of the scalar - field condensations on the cosmic density perturbations . if the universe is reheated by the decay of the scalar field @xmath0 , many of the components in the present universe are generated from the decay products of the @xmath0 field .",
    "in such a case , cosmic density perturbations are affected by the fluctuation of the amplitude of @xmath0 which may be generated during the inflation .",
    "if all the components in the universe originate to the decay product of @xmath0 , density perturbations generated from the primordial fluctuation of @xmath0 becomes adiabatic . in this case , the cmb angular power spectrum from the fluctuation of @xmath0 becomes the usual adiabatic ones with ( almost ) scale - invariant spectrum .",
    "if this becomes the dominant part of the cosmic density perturbations , then we have seen that the constraints on inflation models from observations of the cmb angular power spectrum are drastically relaxed .    if the baryon or the cdm is not generated from @xmath0 but from a new scalar field @xmath92 , on the contrary",
    ", correlated mixture of the adiabatic and isocurvature perturbations may arise .",
    "in particular , if the @xmath92 field starts to oscillate much before the @xmath0 field dominates the universe , the metric and entropy perturbations obey the model - independent relation . in this case",
    ", the cmb angular power spectrum may be significantly affected and the shape of the resultant power spectrum depends on which component has the correlated isocurvature perturbation . if the baryonic component has the correlated isocurvature perturbation , the density perturbations after the decay of @xmath0 become those given in eq .",
    "( [ sb ] ) . in this case , @xmath3 at high multipole is more enhanced relative to that at low multipole . on the contrary , if the cdm is not generated from @xmath0 , correlated isocurvature perturbation can be induced in the cdm component as given in eq .",
    "( [ sc ] ) . in this case ,",
    "heights of the acoustic peaks become lower relative to the sw tail .",
    "if there exists an contamination of these component into the total angular power spectrum , @xmath3 differs from the adiabatic one .",
    "the important point is that , in both cases , too much correlated isocurvature perturbations become inconsistent with the present observation of the cmb power spectrum .",
    "even with the correlated isocurvature perturbation in the baryonic sector , heights of the acoustic peaks can be reduced by introducing uncorrelated isocurvature perturbation .",
    "this may happen , for example , if we take account of the primordial fluctuation of the scalar field @xmath92 .",
    "( for example , this scalar field may be the affleck - dine field . ) in particular , if the sizes of the correlated and uncorrelated entropy perturbations are properly chosen , the resultant cmb power spectrum becomes consistent with the present observations without the effect of the inflaton fluctuation . even in this case , the angular power spectrum is not exactly the same as the conventional adiabatic one and the deviation from the adiabatic result may be observed at on - going and future experiments .    in summary , if there exists correlated mixture of the adiabatic and isocurvature perturbations , the total cmb angular power spectrum can be distorted and it can be a signal of the late - time entropy production due to the decay of the scalar field condensation .",
