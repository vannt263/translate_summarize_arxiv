    "the unusual and intense radio source g357.7@xmath00.1 , the tornado , has been the subject of controversy since it was first recognized by @xcite ( also see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . the tornado has a non - thermal spectrum ( @xmath4 ) and is polarized @xcite .",
    "the morphology of the tornado is unique among galactic sources and it has been suggested that the source is extragalactic , a snr ( supernova remnant ) , or a member of a new class of galactic head tail sources related to w50 and ss443 @xcite .",
    "the discovery of a collisionally pumped oh ( 1720 mhz ) maser near g357.7@xmath00.1 by @xcite has renewed suggestions that the source could , in fact , be a snr . using the zeeman effect , @xcite observed a magnetic field of 0.7 @xmath5 g in the oh maser .",
    "the nature of the flat spectrum , compact source g357.63@xmath00.06 at the western extreme of the tornado has been also controversial .",
    "it has been suggested that the source could contain a pulsar and might be a pulsar wind nebula physically related to the possible snr g357.7@xmath00.1 @xcite .",
    "these authors raise the possibility that this putative pulsar might be interacting with the supernova shell and be responsible for the unusual morphology of g357.7@xmath00.1 , similar to ctb 80 .",
    "alternatively , @xcite have summarized evidence that the source is an hii region that may be unrelated to g357.7@xmath00.1 . as suggested by @xcite , higher resolution radio continuum and recombination line observations of g357.63@xmath00.06",
    "were necessary in order to determine if the source is an hii region , as had been suggested by its flat radio spectrum .",
    "in the following , all references to the `` tail '' , `` head '' , and `` tornado '' refer to the supernova remnant candidate g357.7@xmath00.1 , while the `` eye '' refers to the compact source g357.63@xmath00.06 .",
    "figure 1 shows a 21 cm image created from archival vla data with @xmath6 resolution in which the tail and head of the tornado and the eye are identified for reference .    a search for radio recombination lines ( rrl ) toward g357.63@xmath00.06 ( the eye )",
    "was begun in 2000 using the nrao very large array ( vla ) .",
    "after several unsuccessful searches covering the velocity range of the oh maser ( @xmath012.3 km  s@xmath3 ) in 2000 , we learned of a detection of a br@xmath7 line at high negative velocities using the anglo - australian observatory by @xcite .",
    "we subsequently detected the h@xmath1 line at the surprising velocity of @xmath8 km  s@xmath3 with the vla in 2001 . in order to better constrain the distances of the tornado and the eye , in 2002",
    "we also observed the hi line in absorption with the vla toward these sources .",
    "the vla observations of 2000 and 2001 of the h@xmath1 ( 8.309 ghz ) line are summarized in table 1 .",
    "the initial observations in june and july 2000 only cover the velocity range @xmath9 to 60 km  s@xmath3 , and are centered at @xmath10 km  s@xmath3 , the velocity of the oh maser detected by frail et al .",
    "the wider band width observations of late 2000 ( also centered at @xmath10 km",
    "s@xmath3 ) cover the velocity range of @xmath11 to + 190 km  s@xmath3 .",
    "the data obtained in 2001 were made with a more favorable center velocity ( @xmath12 km  s@xmath3 ) and include the range @xmath13 to 0 km  s@xmath3 .",
    "we also observed the hi line at 1.42 ghz in absorption toward the tornado , and the parameters of these observations are also given in table 1 .",
    "in addition , the parameters of the archival 1.4 and 4.9 ghz continuum data used in our analysis are also shown in table 1 .",
    "all of these data were reduced in the usual fashion using the aips ( astronomical image processing software ) package .",
    "the h@xmath1 and hi spectral line data were hanning smoothed and their spectral resolutions can also be found in table 1 .",
    "subsequent spectral line gaussian fitting and spatial integration were carried out using gipsygipsy/. ] .",
    "in figure 2 , we show vla 8.3 ghz continuum images of the head ( g357.7@xmath00.1 ) and eye ( g357.63@xmath00.06 ) from the combined 2000 data and line free channels of the 2001 data .",
    "the head image was created from uv spacings less than 100 k@xmath14 ( to achieve good image quality and sensitivity to the extended emission ) and its resolution is @xmath15 .",
    "the image of the eye has a resolution of @xmath16 and it was obtained by including all of the longer baselines up to 350 k@xmath14 .",
    "the position of the eye is ra @xmath17 , dec @xmath18 ( j2000 ) .",
    "it is clear from this high resolution image that g357.63@xmath00.06 is not spherically symmetric or of uniform brightness , and its morphology is most likely shell type ( see also burton et al .",
    "both images yield a total flux and size for the compact source , g357.63@xmath00.06 of @xmath19 mjy  beam@xmath3 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "the results from the 8.3 ghz images along with the parameters derived from the line - free 1.4 ghz hi data , archival 1.4 ghz data ( also see fig .",
    "1 ) , and archival 4.9 ghz data are listed in table 2 .    for the 8.3 ghz h@xmath1 line data of 2001 alone ( beam @xmath21 ) ,",
    "the rms noise is 0.4 mjy  beam@xmath3 and the peak of the g357.63@xmath00.06 continuum is 57.6 mjy  beam@xmath3 . in figure 3 , we show the h@xmath1 spectrum toward the peak of g357.63@xmath00.06 . based on a gaussian analysis , the line parameters are : @xmath22 km  s@xmath3 , @xmath23 km  s@xmath3 , and the line to continuum ratio is @xmath24 .",
    "figure 4 shows integrated , continuum weighted hi spectra from the head and eye of the tornado .",
    "both spectra clearly show the 3 kpc arm of the galaxy at @xmath25 km  s@xmath3 , as well as a number of other distinct features at about @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 km  s@xmath3 .",
    "interestingly , the hi spectrum toward the head also shows weak absorption near @xmath8 km  s@xmath3 ( inset in fig .",
    "the hi spectrum toward the eye itself is of insufficient signal to noise to detect the weak @xmath8 km  s@xmath3 feature .",
    "it is certain that both the eye and the body of the tornado are at a distance greater than 5 kpc since hi spectra toward both sources ( fig .",
    "4 ) clearly show the 3 kpc arm of the galaxy at @xmath25 km  s@xmath3 ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "the detection of a rrl toward the eye is unequivocal evidence that g357.63@xmath00.06 is an hii region .",
    "the surprisingly high velocity of this hii region @xmath2",
    "km  s@xmath3 implies that it is kinematically well separated from the oh ( 1720 mhz ) maser discovered by @xcite located @xmath31 to the ne of the eye at a velocity of @xmath32 km  s@xmath3 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . if the oh ( 1720 mhz ) maser is associated with the head of the tornado as inferred by frail et al . , the location of g357.63@xmath00.06 along the symmetry axis of the tornado ( see fig .",
    "1 ) must be viewed as a chance superposition along the line of sight in agreement with the suggestion of @xcite .",
    "it is likely that g357.63@xmath00.06 lies close to the galactic center , most likely in the nuclear disk as this is the only place where such high negative galactic rotation velocities ( @xmath33 km  s@xmath3 ) are found ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if we assume this is the case , the minimum projected distance of this hii region from sgr a is @xmath34 pc .",
    "similar velocities of @xmath33 km  s@xmath3 have been observed @xmath35 ne of g357.63@xmath00.06 towards the sgre hii region complex via radio recombination lines by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the co @xmath36 and @xmath37 diagrams of the galactic center region from @xcite show a resolved clump of co emission about @xmath38 in extent at @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 km  s@xmath3 , confirming the presence of molecular gas in the vicinity of g357.63@xmath00.06 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "co observations by @xcite toward the eye also show a feature at 9 km  s@xmath3 , but this component is most likely related to a foreground molecular cloud , and is not associated with g357.63@xmath00.06 .    our new high dynamic range , integrated hi absorption spectrum towards the head of the tornado ( fig .",
    "4 ) also reveals for the first time an absorption feature at @xmath2 km  s@xmath3 .",
    "the detection of this component unambiguously places the tornado at least as far away as the galactic center distance of 8.5 kpc . if the oh ( 1720 mhz ) maser velocity ( @xmath10 km",
    "s@xmath3 ) is assumed for the body of the tornado , the kinematic ( far ) distance to both the oh ( 1720 ) mhz maser and snr candidate is @xmath42 kpc @xcite .",
    "the measured properties of the eye at 1.42 , 4.86 , and 8.31 ghz from this study are shown in table 2 .",
    "as noted in previous studies the eye has a relatively flat , but slowly rising spectrum below 4.9 ghz @xcite indicative of an optically thin hii region .",
    "our radio flux measurement at 8.3 ghz is the first to fill the gap between 4.9 ghz and 1.3 mm ( upper limit non - detection at 1.3 mm of 1 jy by @xcite ) .",
    "the measured 8.3 ghz flux density of 88 mjy is consistent ( within the noise ) with an optically thin hii region spectrum assuming @xmath43 .",
    "studies of the spectral energy distribution of g357.63@xmath00.06 by @xcite and @xcite using infrared colors ( iras and msx ) show that there can be very little contribution from dust at 8.3 ghz , as expected , in agreement with our findings .",
    "the derived parameters of the hii region g357.63@xmath00.06 assuming @xmath44 kpc , @xmath45 mjy ( 8.3 ghz flux density ) , size=@xmath46 , and @xmath47 are : shell radius @xmath48 pc , electron density @xmath49 @xmath50 , emission measure @xmath51 pc @xmath52 , excitation parameter @xmath53 pc @xmath54 , mass of ionized gas @xmath55 m@xmath56 , and number of lyman continuum photons @xmath57 photons .",
    "the lte electron temperature of the ionized gas is @xmath58 k assuming @xmath47 .",
    "if we assume that a single star powers the hii region given its shell like morphology ( fig .",
    "2 ) , these parameters indicate that the central star is about o9 or b0 type .",
    "these estimates for the parameters of the eye are similar to those listed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we have unambiguously identified g357.63@xmath00.06 as a galactic hii region via the discovery of a 8.3 ghz h@xmath1 radio recombination line at a velocity of @xmath2 km  s@xmath3 . based on this unusually high negative velocity along with new hi absorption data ,",
    "we show that this source most likely lies near the galactic center with a minimum projected distance of 350 pc . using the radio continuum parameters of g357.63@xmath00.06",
    ", we find that the mass of the ionized gas is @xmath55 m@xmath56 and that the number of lyman continuum photons is consistent with this source being powered by a o9 or b0 type star .",
    "assuming that the oh ( 1720 mhz ) maser discovered by @xcite is associated with the the tornado ( g357.7@xmath00.1 ) snr candidate , we also find that the tornado and eye are well separated kinematically .",
    "thus the location of the eye along the symmetry axis of the tornado , while suggestive of a unique interaction given the tornado s unusual morphology , is simply due to chance superposition along the line of sight .",
    "additionally , high dynamic range hi absorption data towards the body of the tornado suggests that it too must lie at least as far away as the galactic center and most likely at 12 kpc if the oh ( 1720 mhz ) maser velocity is assumed .",
    "we would like to thank j. lazendic for sharing with us the br@xmath7 velocity of g357.63@xmath00.06 ahead of publication which allowed us to shift our h@xmath1 radio recombination line observations to a more favorable center velocity .",
