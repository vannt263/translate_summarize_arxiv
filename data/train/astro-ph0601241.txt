    "be stars are well - known to be sources of strong highly anisotropic matter outflow . both a dilute polar wind and a denser equatorial disc",
    "have been invoked to reconcile models for infra - red , ultra - violet and optical observations @xcite .",
    "timing analysis of the system shows that the disc of be star is tilted with respect to the orbital plane @xcite .",
    "the properties of the radio emission from the system are very different close to and far from the periastron .",
    "radio observations of the 1994 , 1997 @xcite , 2000 @xcite , and the 2004 @xcite periastron passages show that when the pulsar is far from periastron the observed radio emission is comprised entirely in highly linearly polarized pulsed emission from the pulsar itself with an intensity practically independent of the pulsar orbital position @xcite .",
    "but , starting about 100 days before periastron , depolarization of the pulsed emission occurs , the dispersion measure and the absolute value of the rotation measure increase while the flux density decreases .",
    "the pulsed radio emission then disappears entirely as the pulsar enters the disc and is hidden behind it ( relative to the observer ) approximately 20 days before the periastron passage .",
    "shortly before the disc crossing unpulsed radio emission appears and within several days sharply rises to a peak which is more than ten times higher than the intensity of the pulsed emission far from the periastron . afterward",
    "the unpulsed flux slightly decreases , as the pulsar passes through periastron before reaching a second peak just after the pulsar crosses the disc for the second time .",
    "the unpulsed radio emission is detected until at least 100 days after the periastron passage . @xcite .",
    "the first detection of the x - rays from  system was done by _ rosat _ in 1992 @xcite .",
    "the most recent published observations of the system in x - rays were carried out with the satellite in 1994 and 1995 @xcite .",
    "these observations show that x - ray emission is approximately twice as high at the time of the disc crossing than at periastron . in soft gamma - rays",
    "the system was observed only after the periastron passage with cgro / osse and /isgri @xcite .",
    "the combined soft gamma- and x - ray spectrum is consistent with a power law of photon index @xmath8 .",
    "this index also coincides with the radio spectral index of the unpulsed emission .",
    "no pulsed x - ray emission was detected from the system . with the standard epoch - folding method the upper limit to a pulsed component in 2",
    " 10 kev energy range was estimated to be about 10% of the unpulsed component close to the periastron , and to about 40% during the apastron @xcite .",
    "note that search for the pulsations in p - p space allowed @xcite to reduce an upper limit close to the periastron to less than 2% under a certain assumptions on the shape of pulse profile .",
    "the 2004 periastron passage was observed in tev gamma - rays by hess @xcite .",
    "tev lightcurve of the source shows an unexpected behaviour .",
    "contrary to the prediction that the tev flux should be maximum at the periastron @xcite , the flux apparently has a local minimum around this moment .",
    "several theoretical models were put forward to explain the behaviour of the x - ray lightcurve of the system . in the model of @xcite , the enhancement of _ synchrotron _ x - ray emission during the disk passage is attributed to enhancement of magnetic field at the position of the contact surface of pulsar and stellar winds . in the model of @xcite the enhancement of the _ inverse compton _ x - ray emission during the disk passage is supposed to be due to the effect of the macroscopic mixing of the stellar and pulsar winds in the disk which effectively enhances the escape time of high - energy electrons responsible for the observed emission .",
    "typical energies of electrons responsible for the x - ray emission are @xmath9  tev in @xcite model while in @xcite model @xmath10  mev .",
    "one can , in principle , distinguish between the two models by comparing the details of radio , x - ray and tev lightcurve of the system .",
    "we have organized a cycle of five observations as the pulsar approached the 2004 periastron . in this paper",
    "we present the results of our observations along with other  observations of the system not previously published . for the completeness",
    "we also include the analysis of the previously unpublished  data .",
    "the 2004 periastron passage was extensively observed in radio @xcite and tev @xcite bands .",
    "combination of the radio , x - ray and tev data opens up a possibility , to study the evolution of the spectrum of  system over some 12 decades in energy .",
    "our analysis of large x - ray data set enables , for the first time , to constrain the geometrical parameters of the disk of be star , such as the opening angle and orientation . comparing the tev and x - ray lightcurves we find that the increase of the tev flux some 10 to 100 days after the periastron passage is unambiguously related to the pulsar passage through",
    "the be star disk for the second time .",
    "this challenges the conventional interpretation of the observed tev emission as the inverse compton emission from the pulsar wind electrons .",
    "another surprising result of our analysis that is not predicted in the theroetical models cited above is the persistently hard x - ray spectrum ( photon index @xmath11 ) observed during the 10-day period when the pulsar enters the disk .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we describe the details of the and  data analysis .",
    "the results are presented in section 3 , and discussed in section 4 .",
    "in figure [ xmm_ellips ] we show a schematic drawing of the pulsar orbit along with the approximate location of the pulsar position during , , and  observations .",
    "the x - ray observations are more - or - less homogeneously distributed over the whole range of pulsar orbital phase @xmath12 .",
    "the figure also shows the location of the be star disk ( parameters of the disk are found below from the analysis of the x - ray data ) .",
    "one can see that the set of observations denoted as x6  x10 enables to study the entrance to the disk in great details .",
    "is the orbital phase of the pulsar referred in the text.,width=321 ]      the log of the  data analyzed in this paper is presented in table 1 .",
    " x10 were obtained as part of the 2004 periastron campaign and we have also used all other  observations of the system , which are now public ( x1  x5 ) . in the table negative @xmath13 denotes the number of days before the date of 2004 periastron passage ( 2004 march 7 ) , and positive values correspond to the number of days after the 2000 periastron ( 2000 october 17 ) .",
    "@xmath14 is the orbital phase counted as shown in fig .",
    "[ xmm_ellips ] .",
    ".journal of  observations of [ data ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath15 number in parentheses represent 68% confidence interval uncertainties in the last digit quoted .    in figure [ cntrspe ]",
    "we show contour plots of @xmath16 versus photon spectral index @xmath17 , holding the 1  10 kev flux fixed at the values given in table [ summary ] .",
    "the contours plotted are the 68% , 90% , and 99% confidence levels . for the x5 observation the values of @xmath16 and @xmath17",
    "are consistent with x4 observation , and we omitted the x4 contours to keep the figure clear .",
    "one can see that the variation of @xmath16 as a function of orbital phase is correlated with the be star disk crossing .",
    "no variations of @xmath16 are observed for the  observations x2 to x7 which all fall outside the disk ( assuming the disk parameters found in section 3.2 )",
    ". the mean value of of @xmath16 during these observations is @xmath18@xmath19 .",
    "however , the observations x8 , x9 , x10 and x1 are characterized by absorption which is higher by a factor of about 1.5 , @xmath20@xmath19 .",
    "thus , the hydrogen column density remains high starting from about 20 days before the periastron till at least 87 days after periastron .",
    "the behaviour of the spectral slope as a function of the orbital phase @xmath14 found in xmm observations differs from the one found in  observations .",
    "whereas in 1994  1995 the spectrum at apastron was found to be significantly harder than during periastron ,   observations show much softer spectrum at the apastron with the spectral slope close to the  periastron value .",
    "the most remarkable feature of the spectral evolution of the system is the hardening of the x - ray spectrum close to the moment when pulsar enters the be star disk at the phase @xmath21 .",
    "one can see that the decrease of the photon index @xmath17 is simultaneous with the onset of the rapid growth of the x - ray flux .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , such behaviour was not predicted in any of existing models of x - ray emission from the system .",
    "moreover , the observed values @xmath22 during the observations x6 ",
    "x10 are difficult to reconcile with the models of synchrotron or inverse compton emission from shock - accelerated electrons because of the too hard electron spectrum implied .",
    "possible error in determination of @xmath17 due to the uncertainty in determination of @xmath16 ( see fig . [ cntrspe ] ) is too small to allow for @xmath4 at least for observations x7  x9 .",
    "in all theoretical models of unpulsed emission from the collision of relativistic pulsar wind with non - relativistic wind of the be star plays a crucial role . due to the interaction of the winds a system of two shock waves forms between the stars .",
    "close to the be star and to the pulsar both winds are supposed to be radial but after passing the shocks particles turn and start to flow along the contact surface , losing their energy via synchrotron and inverse compton ( with the seed photons being the be star soft photons ) emission .    in the model of @xcite ( ci )",
    "the observed x - ray emission is due to inverse compton scattering of soft photons from the be star on the same electron populaiton that produce the non - pulsed radio emission from the system .",
    "the intensity of observed unpulsed x - ray and radio emission depends strongly on the flow velocity of the relativistic particles beyond the shock .",
    "slower drift velocity leads to the higher concentration of the relativistic electrons beyond the shock and higher x - ray and radio luminosity .",
    "decrease of the drift velocity during the pulsar passage through the disk is caused by the macroscopical mixing of pulsar wind with the stellar wind .",
    "main prediction of this model is the correlation of x - ray with the radio lightcurves of the system .",
    "although different quality of x - ray and radio lightcurves does not allow to make definitive conclusions about radio - x - ray correlations , our  observations show that the onset of rapid increase of the x - ray flux is simultaneous with appearance of the unpulsed radio emission from the system ( see fig [ xradio ] ) .",
    "@xmath23 , @xmath24  g ( low ) and @xmath25  g ( high synchrotron flux ) , @xmath26 , with such parameters coulomb break is at @xmath27 .",
    "the same parameters are used for the calculation of the shocked stellar wind emission ( green dashed curves ) in the lower panel .",
    "the emission from the shocked pulsar wind was calculated assuming @xmath28@xmath23 , @xmath29  g ( low ) and @xmath30  g ( high synchrotron flux ) , @xmath31 . with such parameters coulomb",
    "break is at @xmath32 . ]",
    "the x - ray inverse compton emission in the ci model is produced by electrons with rather moderate gamma - factors , @xmath33 while the gamma - factors of radio - synchrotron - emitting electrons are around @xmath34 .",
    "the synchrotron / inverse compton cooling times for such electrons are @xmath35^{3/2}\\left[\\frac{10\\mbox { ghz}}{\\nu}\\right]^{1/2}\\mbox { s}\\nonumber\\\\ t_{ic}&\\simeq & 10 ^ 6\\left[\\frac{1\\mbox { erg / cm}^3}{u_r}\\right ] \\left[\\frac{1\\mbox { kev}}{\\epsilon_{ic}}\\right]^{1/2}\\mbox { s}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] both are large compared to the typical adiabatic cooling ( or escape ) time @xmath36  s ( @xmath37 is the characteristic size of the emission region , and @xmath38 is the velocity of the flow along the contact surface ) .",
    "another important time scale for the electrons in the energy range relevant in the ci model is the coulomb loss scale @xmath39\\left[\\frac{\\gamma_e}{10}\\right]\\mbox { s}\\ ] ] as the pulsar enters the disk , the density of the stellar wind increases .",
    "typical estimates of the wind denisty at the pulsar location ( assuming the radial profile @xmath40 ) result in the density estimate @xmath41  @xmath23 .",
    "thus , inside the disk coulomb cooling time is comparable to the escape time .",
    "this effect leads to the modification of electron spectrum at the energies below the so - called `` coulomb break '' energy at which @xmath42 : @xmath43\\left[\\frac{t_{esc}}{10 ^ 3\\mbox { s}}\\right]\\ ] ] namely , since the coulomb loss rate @xmath44 is energy - independent , the electron acceleration spectrum with the spectral index @xmath45 hardens to @xmath46 below the break energy .",
    "this naturally leads to the hardening of the spectrum of inverse compton x - ray emission at the moment when the pulsar enters the disk , as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ models]a .",
    "one can note that the coulomb break energy ( [ break ] ) is close to the energy of the x - ray emitting photons .",
    "this means that the x - ray photon index is very sensitive to the slight changes of the density and/or of the outflow velocity ( see fig .",
    "[ models]a in which the two spectra are calculated for @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) . since both vary during the disk passage ( it is assumed that within the disk pulsar and stellar winds are macroscopically mixed ) , numerical modelling is required to predict the time evolution of the x - ray spectral index .",
    "we leave the detailed modelling of this for future work @xcite .    in the original ci model , only electorns with typical gamma - factors of 10 - 100",
    "are considered .",
    "the presence of protons with comparable gamma - factors @xmath49 at the contact surface would lead to the generation of tev emission during the disk passage which is due to the proton - proton interactions in the disk ( see @xcite ) .",
    "macroscopic mixing of the pulsar and stellar wind will lead to the increase of the proton - proton interaction rate in the disk , which can explain the form of the tev lightcurve of the system .    in the model of @xcite",
    "( ta ) the x - ray emission is the synchrotron emission from shock - accelerated electrons of the pulsar wind .",
    "typical gamma - factors of the x - ray emitting electrons are @xmath50 .",
    "modulation of the x - ray flux from the source during the disk and periastron passage is due to the combined effect of displacement of the contact surface by the disk ( which leads to the variation of the magnetic field strength ) and the increase of the inverse compton energy loss close to the periastron .",
    "one of the main predictions of ta model is steepening of the x - ray spectrum during the disk and periastron passage .",
    "the effect is due to the fact that synchrotron and/or inverse compton cooling time of x - ray emitting electron becomes comparable or shorter than the time needed to escape from the emission region .",
    "however , the observed behaviour of the spectrum is quite opposite : the entrance to the disc is accompanied by the hardening of the spectrum .",
    "the values of the photon index @xmath22 found in the observations x6 ",
    "x10 are too hard to be explained with the synchrotron emission from shock - accelerated electrons which normally result in the electron spectra with power - law index @xmath51 and , correspondingly in synchrotron spectra with photon index @xmath4 .",
    "of course , over a large fraction of the pulsar orbit the synchrotron cooling time is larger than the time needed to escape from the emission region along the contact surface .",
    "thus , if one assumes that the production spectrum of high - energy electrons responsible for the x - ray emission is harder than @xmath52 , ( if , e.g. electrons originate in the cold pulsar wind with the bulk lorentz factor @xmath53 ) , it is possible , in principle , to obtain spectra which are harder than @xmath54 .",
    "however , in this case one expects to observe the very hard x - ray spectrum with @xmath22 over most of the pulsar orbit .    within the ta model radio synchrotron emission originates from different population of electrons than the x - ray synchrotron emission (",
    "radio is convensionally attributed to shock - accelerated stellar wind electrons , while x - ray flux is emitted by the pulsar wind electrons ) . although it is not possible to explain the hardening of the x - ray spectral index by the changes in the pulsar wind electron spectrum , one can try to ascribe the observed hardening to the contribution from the shocked stellar wind electrons . the x - ray spectrum with photon index",
    "harder than @xmath54 is natural if there is a bremsstrahlung contribution to the x - ray flux .",
    "the increase of the density of stellar wind inside the disk can lead to the increase of bremsstrahlung luminosity .",
    "the estimate of the bremsstrahlung loss time @xmath55\\mbox { s}\\ ] ] shows that for radio emitting electrons it is orders of magnitude shorter than the synchrotron cooling time ( see ( [ synch ] ) ) .",
    "thus , the bremsstrahlung luminosity should be much higher than the radio synchrotron luminosity . from fig .",
    "[ models ] one can see that a satisfactory fit to the broad - band spectrum can be obtained assuming the disk density @xmath56  @xmath23 .",
    "it is interesting to note that bremsstrahlung can also explain the behaviour of the tev lightcurve in this case , if one assumes the possibility of mixing of the pulsar wind electrons with the pulsar disk medium ( similar to the one assumed in the ci model ) .",
    "the bremsstrahlung model faces , however , a serious overall energetics problem . from fig .",
    "[ models]b one can see that the total bremsstrahlung luminosity is at least 2 orders of magnitude higher than the x - ray luminosity at the moment of x7 observation , @xmath57  erg / s ( see fig . [ xradio ] ) . as it is discussed above",
    ", the energy loss rate of mildly relativistic electrons responsible for the bremsstrahlung emission is dominated by the coulomb losses . comparing ( [ brems ] ) to ( [ coul ] ) one can see that the coulom loss rate is still 2 - 3 orders of magnitude higher than the bremsstrahlung luminosity . thus , to obtain the x - ray bremsstrahlung flux at the level of @xmath58  erg / s one has to assume that the power injected into the @xmath59  mev electrons is about @xmath60  erg / s which is much higher than the spin - down luminosity of the pulsar @xmath61  erg / s .",
    "in this paper we have presented the  observations of the pulsar psr b1259 - 63 during its 2004 periastron passage near the companion be star ss 2883 . combining our observations with the previous x - ray observations from ,  and  we produced the detailed lightcurve of the system over the wide range of the orbital phases .    using the large x - ray data sample we were able to constrain the geometry of the be star disk .",
    "in particular , we have found that the half - opening angle of the disk ( projected on the pulsar orbital plane ) is @xmath0 and that the line of intersection of the disk with the pulsar orbital plane is inclined at about @xmath62 with respect to the major axis of the pulsar orbit .",
    "inspection of the x - ray and tev lightcurves of the system has revealed correlation of the x - ray and tev flux variations .",
    "our analysis shows that the variations of the tev flux some 10 - 100 days after the periastron passage can be well fit with the gaussian curve whose parameters coincide with the parameters of the disk found from the x - ray analysis ( center at @xmath63 , half - width @xmath64 ) ( see fig .",
    "[ gauss ] ) .",
    "if the observed behaviour of the flux is indeed due to the influence of be star disk , it can not be explained within the inverse compton scattering model of tev emission from the system .    our  observations which were done during the period of first pulsar entrance to the disk ( some 40 to 20 days before the periastron ) revealed quite unexpected evolution of the spectrum of x - ray emission .",
    "in particular , the x - ray spectral slope hardened from @xmath65 down to @xmath66 roughly at the onset of the rapid growth of the x - ray luminosity .",
    "this behaviour can not be explained within the synchrotron model of x - ray emission from the system .",
    "we have shown that the observed hardening can be the result of the hardening of electron spectrum due to the coulomb losses in the disk in the model where x - ray emission is the inverse compton emission from the population of electrons responsible for the radio synchrotron emission .",
    "otherwise , the hardening can be caused by the increase of the bremsstrahlung emission from these electrons .",
    "however , the bremsstrahlung problem faces a serious energy balance problem .",
