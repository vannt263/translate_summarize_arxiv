    "early - type galaxies form a remarkably homogeneous class of objects with a tight color - magnitude relation and a well defined fundamental plane . the small scatter in their colors ( bower , lucey & ellis 1992 , stanford , eisenhardt & dickinson 1998 , ) and mass - to - light ( m / l ) ratios ( cf .",
    "kelson et al . 2000 ) suggest that early - type galaxies formed the bulk of their stars at high redshift ( i.e. @xmath7 2 - 3 , van dokkum et al .",

    "the detailed indices analysis of thomas et al .",
    "( 2005 ) shows that the more massive early - type galaxies are generally dominated by old stellar populations , enriched in the @xmath12 elements , while intermediate - age stars are found in early - type galaxies less massive than 10@xmath13 m@xmath10 and with low [ @xmath12/fe ] ratios ( cf . also nelan et al .",
    "2005 ) . the combination of old stellar ages and high abundance ratios typical of massive early - type galaxies is suggestive of short formation timescales ( i.e. 1  gyr , thomas , greggio & bender 1999 ) , during which star formation occurred either with a flattened imf ( thomas 1999 ) , or through multiple bursts characterized by an enhanced star - formation activity . on the other hand ,",
    "the spheroidal morphology and hot dynamics observed in these systems require major mergers , which result in a more extended dynamical history .",
    "the discrepancy in the star - formation and dynamical timescales may be reconciled through the _ progenitor bias _",
    "( van dokkum & franx 2001 ) , whereby about 50@xmath6 of the present - day early - type galaxies were transformed from star - forming galaxies at @xmath14 1 , with the latters possibly having a constant star formation rate prior to their morphological transformation .",
    "the question , at this point , is whether the scaling relations derived for early - type galaxies at @xmath14 1 apply also to early - type galaxies at intermediate redshift .",
    "the high angular resolution of the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) onboard hst allows for the very first time to measure the structural parameters of early - type galaxies in the udf / grapes surveys with redshifts between 0.5 and 1.3 . in this paper",
    ", we will discuss their star formation histories as derived from their grapes ( grism acs program for extragalactic science , pirzkal et al .",
    "2004 ) spectra and their possible assembling histories as deduced from their isophotal structure in the udf images ( a concordance cosmology , @xmath15cdm , @xmath16 , @xmath17  km  s@xmath18  mpc@xmath18 , is assumed hereafter ) .",
    "the traditional approach to the formation of early - type galaxies is to study their stellar populations via spectro - photometric observables ( see e.g. worthey 1994 ; trager et al . 2000 ; bernardi et al . 2003 ) , derive the age and metallicity distribution of their ( unresolved ) stellar content and finally reconstruct their star - formation history .",
    "this is the ultimate ingredient in distinguishing between different mechanisms for the formation of ellipticals , such as monolithic collapse ( eggen , lynden - bell & sandage 1962 ) and hierarchical merging ( kauffmann et al . 1993 ) . at the same time",
    ", the study of the morphology of early - type galaxies allows us to constrain their assembly history .    the advent of wide - field imaging surveys performed from the ground and with hst ( e.g. williams et al .",
    "1996 , giavalisco et al .",
    "2004 , beckwith et al .",
    "2005 ) has proved that galaxy structure evolves with time , so that more distant galaxies are more peculiar than those in the local universe on which the hubble classification was originally based ( driver et al .",

    "1996 , driver et al .",
    "1998 , brichmann & ellis 2000 , conselice et al . 2005 ) . furthermore , the morphology - density relation ( dressler 1980 , dressler et al .",
    "1997 ) confirms that galaxy morphology depends strongly on environment , with early - type galaxies preferentially living in high density regions .",
    "notice , here , that the morphological k - correction can affect the morphological classification , depending on the fading of the surface brightness with wavelength .",
    "windhorst et al .",
    "( 2002 , cf . also colley et al .",
    "1996 ) showed that early - type galaxies endure a significant decrease in their surface brightness from red to mid - uv wavelengths which could lead to a different classification and makes them almost undetectable at intermediate to high redshifts .",
    "mid - type and star - forming galaxies appear in the mid - uv with a somewhat later type , while the majority of late - type and merging systems have a morphology little dependent on wavelength .",
    "galaxy shapes can be quantified into several `` morphological parameters '' ( e.g. surface brightness profile , bulge - to - disk ratio , ellipticity , light concentration , asymmetry and clumpiness ) which turn out to correlate with the galaxy star - formation rate , stellar mass , central black hole mass and merging history .",
    "for example , the light concentration of a galaxy varies with its luminosity , stellar mass , size and the mass of the central black hole ( caon et al .",

    "2000 , graham et al .",
    "2001 , conselice 2003 ) .",
    "therefore , it depends on the past formation history of a galaxy .",
    "asymmetry and clumpiness `` measure '' a more recent epoch in the evolution of a galaxy , since asymmetry is due to the presence of a merger and/or to tidal interactions , and clumpiness correlates with the degree of on - going star formation ( conselice 2003 ) .",
    "these correlations allow us to decipher galaxy morphologies into mechanisms of galaxy formation and into time evolution of galaxy assembly .",
    "extensive imaging from the ground and with hst has revealed that a large fraction of nearby elliptical galaxies ( es ) differ from a pure ellipse shape and do show substructures .",
    "for example , the ellipticity is not always constant with distance from the galaxy center . di tullio ( 1978 , 1979 ) found that isolated es are , on average , characterized by a decreasing ellipticity , while the mean ellipticity profile is either increasing or peaking with radius in es located in galaxy clusters and groups . a change in the position angle of the galaxy major axis",
    "is often observed and explained as a projection effect of a triaxial structure whose axes ratios ( _ b / a _ and _ c / a _ ) vary with radius ( galletta 1980 , franx 1988 ) .",
    "about 60@xmath6 of es have `` non - elliptical '' isophotes , equally separated into _ disky _ or _ boxy _ ( bender et al .",
    "1988 , 1989 ) .",
    "disky es are generally oblate rotators , while boxy es span a variety of kinematical properties and are systematically bigger and brighter , suggesting that they formed via mergers ( naab , burkert & hernquist 1999 ) .",
    "almost half of the nearby es , especially those in galaxy groups , show dust lanes which are aligned with the major or minor axis and thus believed to be byproducts of mergers ( lauer 1985 , sadler & gerhard 1985 , ebneter & balick 1985 , van dokkum & franx 1995 , tran et al .",

    "elliptical galaxies surrounded by shells have also been observed and are thought to be the result of a collision with a disk galaxy ( malin & carter 1983 , quinn 1984 , michard & prugniel 2004 ) .",
    "finally , a blue core , possibly experiencing star formation , has been detected in @xmath1930@xmath6 of nearby es ( abraham et al .",

    "the purpose of this paper is to extend this study to early - type galaxies at intermediate redshift , so to describe in detail their structure - redshift correlation and to complement this with an accurate study of their stellar populations .",
    "the hubble ultra deep field ( udf ) is a survey of a 3@xmath20.4 @xmath21 3@xmath20.4 field located in the chandra deep field south , which was carried out with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) in four filters : f435w , f606w , f775w and f850lp ( cf .",

    "the grism observations were taken at different epochs and at four different orientations in order to minimize the spectra contamination and overlapping from nearby sources .",
    "we have been then able to extract low resolution spectra ( r @xmath22 100 , in the range 5500  to 10500  ) for 5138 sources in the udf field down to a limiting magnitude of @xmath23 29.5 in ab system .",

    "we found that this criterion imposes an apparent magnitude limit around @xmath26 = 24.0 in ab system .",

    "the _ bona fide _ early - type galaxies span the redshift range between @xmath11 0.5 and 1.3 , with about 80@xmath6 of the sample being distributed between @xmath11 0.5 and @xmath11 0.8 .",
    "notice here that 39@xmath6 of the _ bona fide _ early - type galaxies are clustered around @xmath11 0.665 .",
    "this is a well known spike , since it has been detected in the k20 sample of ellipticals ( cimatti et al .",
    "2002 ) , in the chandra deep field south ( gilli et al . 2003 ) and in the vlt spectroscopic follow - up of goods ( vanzella et al . 2005 ) .",
    "these surveys indicate that the galaxies at @xmath11 0.67 constitute a loose structure rather than a cluster .",
    "our first approach in the study of the sample involves the star formation histories . in order to break the age - metallicity degeneracy , we combined models of galactic chemical enrichment and the low resolution slitless spectroscopy from the grapes data .",
    "we took extra care in avoiding contamination from nearby sources , which  in some cases  required the use of data corresponding to a single orientation .",
    "in order to make a robust assessment of the ages and metallicities of the unresolved stellar populations , we decided to use two different models to describe the star formation histories , as described below .",
    "briefly , the models depend on a reduced set of parameters , which uniquely determine a star formation history ( sfh ) , i.e. a distribution of stellar ages and metallicities . this sfh is used to combine simple stellar populations from the models of bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) and obtain a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) assuming a salpeter imf .",
    "each choice of sfh is compared with the data via a @xmath34 test .",
    "we explore a wide volume of parameter space in order to infer robust constraints on the ages and metallicities of the stellar populations in these galaxies .",
    "this comparison requires a careful process of degrading the synthetic sed ( resolution @xmath35 ) to the ( variable ) resolution of the grapes spectra .",
    "special care must be taken with respect to the change of the psf with wavelength , which results in both an effective degradation of the spectral resolution as a function of wavelength , and a different net spectral resolution with respect to the size of the galaxy .",
    "the latter requires the spectral resolution to be treated as a free parameter , to be chosen by a maximum likelihood method .",
    "we found that this parameter is not degenerate with respect to those describing the star formation history , and mostly results in a global shift of the likelihood .",
    "the two models chosen to describe the build - up of the stellar component are as follows :    * model # 1 ( exp ) : * we take a simple exponentially decaying star formation rate so that each history is uniquely parameterized by a formation epoch  which can be described by a formation redshift ( @xmath36 ) , a star formation timescale ( @xmath37 ) and a metallicity ( @xmath38 $ ] ) which is kept fixed at all times .",
    "* model # 2 ( csp ) : * we follow a consistent chemical enrichment code as described in ferreras & silk ( 2000 ) .",
    "the model allows for gas infall and outflows and keeps the star formation efficiency as a free parameter .",
    "the metallicity evolves according to these parameters , using the stellar yields from thielemann , nomoto & hashimoto ( 1996 ) for massive stars ( @xmath39 ) and van den hoek & groenewegen ( 1997 ) for intermediate mass stars .",
    "the free parameters are the star formation efficiency , the fraction of gas ejected in outflows , the formation epoch , and the timescale for the infall of gas .",
    "figure 2 shows the best fits and the observed seds .",
    "the error bars represent the observations and the solid line correspond to the best fits for the csp model .",
    "figure 3 shows the ages and metallicities of the best sfhs for each galaxy .",
    "average and rms scatter for age and metallicity are shown as dots and error bars , respectively .",
    "notice the metallicity in the exp models do not have an error bar as this model assumes a fixed value of metallicity for each sfh .",
    "the lines in the bottom panel give the age of the universe as a function of redshift ( solid line ) and the ages at that redshift corresponding to a formation epoch of ( dashed , from top to bottom ) @xmath40 .",
    "analogously to the analysis of the surface brightness distribution shown in the next sections , we find that the stellar populations in these galaxies are dominated by old , passively evolving stars , formed at redshifts @xmath41 .",
    "notice that the exp model tends to underestimate the stellar ages .",
    "this model assumes a constant metallicity , which often forces older populations to have higher metallicities , which is compensated by the age - metallicity degeneracy by shifting the average towards younger ages .",
    "the more consistent model ( csp ) generates a more realistic distribution of metallicities and we should expect it to be closer to the true populations . nevertheless , the difference between these models is rather small , and we can safely reject a significant star formation at @xmath42 in _ all _ galaxies .",
    "these models also give galaxy mass estimates in the range 9.5 @xmath29 log(m / m@xmath10 ) @xmath29 11.5 .",
    "the star formation histories that give the best fit can be used to predict the evolution of the color - magnitude relation ( cmr ) .",
    "figure 4 shows the rest - frame @xmath43 vs. @xmath44 cmr of our sample .",
    "the filled dots are simple translations of the observed photometry to restframe @xmath43 ( i.e. a k correction ) whereas the open dots evolve these galaxies to zero redshift , in order to compare our galaxies with local samples .",
    "two characteristic error bars are shown .",
    "we plot coma cluster galaxies from bower , lucey & ellis ( 1992 ) and the dashed lines represent the linear fit and scatter .",
    "the figure shows that our sample of early - type galaxies is fairly consistent with the stellar populations found in local elliptical galaxies .",
    "notice that the passive fading of the brightest galaxies puts them at @xmath45 within the luminosity range of the brightest local ellipticals .",
    "the available information also allows us to explore a projection of the fundamental plane , namely the kormendy relation ( kormendy 1977 ) .",

    "on the other hand , given the number of objects detected in the udf field and the size of the galaxies in our sample , we have estimated a probability of about 30@xmath6 for objects to overlap .",
    "a more intriguing possibility is that the most compact of these clumps are physically associated with the _ bona fide _ early - type galaxies , and , as such , may be hii regions or young star clusters or satellite dwarf galaxies . to test this hypothesis , we ran the hyperz code ( bolzonella et al .",
    "2000 ) on the set of magnitudes measured for each clump , assuming that the clump is at the same redshift of the galaxy in which it has been observed .",

    "the arc feature in udf5177 is apparently offset from the center of the light distribution of the galaxy and could be interpreted as the remnant of an accreted dwarf galaxy which went tidally disrupted .",

    "according to the current paradigm of galaxy formation , ellipticals form through the merger of galaxies .",

    "( 2005 ) for a sample of udf early - type galaxies at @xmath3 2 . ] as discussed by hamilton ( 1985 ) , spectroscopically - selected early - type galaxies are generally seen long after ( i.e. @xmath60 1 gyr ) the last major merger .",
    "after such a merger , these objects quickly settle back to their quasi steady - state , and will then look for a much longer time like non - evolving ellipticals : it is during this phase that we select and observe them now ( cf . also van dokkum & franx 2001 ) .",

    "the slight overabundance of disky _ vs _ boxy ellipticals in our sample could be explained by their environment .",

    "the _ @xmath62 _",
    "parameter appears to be larger than measured by bender et al . for nearly one third of the _ bona fide _ early - type galaxies .",
    "this deviation is likely due to the presence of dust features ( in @xmath19 10@xmath6 of the sample , a percentage a factor of 4 smaller than observed at @xmath80 = 0 ) and most notably of clumps close to the galaxy center .",

    "gas accretion is also invoked to explain the presence of four star - forming regions in the double - double radio galaxy 3c 236 ; their age difference would compare with the timescale of the nuclear activity in this galaxy and hence would set time constraints on the infall of gas experienced by 3c 236 ( odea et al .",
    "2001 ) .    to add more speculation to the picture ,",

    "such a shell is the relic of a relatively recent merger with a smaller _ disk galaxy _ and can be observed for about 1 gyr .",
    "the high phase - space density of a disk galaxy is indeed required to produce such a spatially confined substructure as the observed shells are .",
    "the grapes spectrum of udf153 indicates a redshift of 0.98 , suggesting that the merger possibly occurred at @xmath82 1 .",

    "<S> we present a two - pronged approach to the formation of early - type galaxies , using a sample of 18 galaxies at @xmath0 from the hst / acs ultra deep field and grapes surveys : 1 ) we combine slitless low resolution spectroscopy from the grapes dataset with simple models of galaxy formation to explore their star formation histories . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) we also perform an analysis of their surface brightness distribution with the unprecedented details provided by the acs superb angular resolution and photometric depth . </S>",
    "<S> our spectroscopic analysis reveals that their stellar populations are rather homogeneous in age and metallicity and formed at redshifts @xmath1 . evolving them passively , they become practically indistinguishable from ellipticals at @xmath2 0 . </S>",
    "<S> also , their isophotal shapes appear very similar to those observed for nearby ellipticals , in that the percentages of disky and boxy galaxies at @xmath3 1 are close to the values measured at @xmath2 0 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we find that the isophotal structure of @xmath4 1 early - type galaxies obeys the correlations already observed among nearby ellipticals , i.e. disky ellipticals have generally higher characteristic ellipticities , and boxy ellipticals have larger half - light radii and are brighter in the rest - frame b band . in this respect then , no significant structural differences are seen for ellipticals between @xmath2 0 and 1 . </S>",

    "<S> parameter measures the deviations from a pure elliptical isophote which are not symmetric with respect to the galaxy center , as in the case of dust features and most notably of clumps . blue clumps have been detected in nearly 50@xmath6 of the @xmath4 1 early - type galaxies ; their photometry is suggestive of young star clusters or dwarf irregulars if they are assumed to be at the same redshift as their host galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we speculate that these clumps may represent recent accretion episodes , and that they could be a way to produce blue cores if their dynamical time is such for them to rapidly sink to the galaxy center . </S>"
