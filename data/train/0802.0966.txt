    "furthermore , all harmonic measures @xmath77 on @xmath40 are equivalent .",
    "thus , by showing that the harmonic measure class on @xmath40 is non - trivial , we can construct non - trivial bounded harmonic functions on @xmath0 . to show that , for a given continuous boundary function @xmath47 , the harmonic function @xmath84 extends continuously to",

    "in particular , for a continuous boundary function @xmath89 , the unique solution to the dirichlet problem at infinity is given by formula .",
    "the first results in this direction have been obtained by prat @xcite between 1971 and 1975 .",
    "he proved that on a cartan - hadamard manifold with sectional curvature bounded from above by a negative constant @xmath90 , @xmath91 , brownian motion is transient , i.e. ,  almost surely all paths of the brownian motion exit from @xmath0 at the sphere at infinity @xcite .",

    "the proof there was given in explicit terms for the two dimensional case .",
    "the case of a cartan - hadamard manifold @xmath11 with pinched negative curvature without additional conditions and arbitrary dimension was finally treated in kifer  @xcite .    independently of anderson , in 1983 , sullivan @xcite gave a stochastic proof of the fact that on a cartan - hadamard manifold with pinched negative curvature the dirichlet problem at infinity is uniquely solvable .",
    "the crucial point has been to prove that the harmonic measure class is non - trivial in this case .",
    "the harmonic measure class on @xmath95 is positive on each non - void open set .",
    "in fact , if @xmath85 in @xmath0 converges to @xmath88 in @xmath40 , then the poisson hitting measures @xmath87 tend weakly to the dirac mass at  @xmath88 .",
    "in the special case of a riemannian surface @xmath0 of negative curvature bounded from above by a negative constant , kendall @xcite gave a simple stochastic proof that the dirichlet problem at infinity is uniquely solvable .",
    "he thereby used the fact that every geodesic on the riemannian surface `` joining '' two different points on the sphere at infinity divides the surface into two disjoint half - parts .",
    "starting from a point @xmath63 on @xmath0 , with non - trivial probability brownian motion will eventually stay in one of the two half - parts up to its lifetime .",
    "as this is valid for every geodesic and every starting point @xmath63 , the non - triviality of the harmonic measure class on @xmath40 follows .    concerning the case of cartan - hadamard manifolds of arbitrary dimension several results",
    "have been published how the pinched curvature assumption can be relaxed such that still the dirichlet problem at infinity for @xmath0 is solvable , e.g.  @xcite and @xcite .",
    "let @xmath11 be a cartan - hadamard manifold .",
    "the dirichlet problem at infinity for @xmath0 is solvable if one of the following conditions is satisfied :",
    "1 .   there exists a positive constant @xmath96 and a positive and nonincreasing function @xmath97 with @xmath98 such that @xmath99 2 .",
    "there exist positive constants @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 such that @xmath103 for all @xmath29 with @xmath104 .",
    "it was an open problem for some time whether the existence of a strictly negative upper bound for the sectional curvature could already be a sufficient condition for the solvability of the dirichlet problem at infinity as it is true in dimension  2 . in 1994 however , ancona @xcite constructed a riemannian manifold with sectional curvatures bounded above by a negative constant such that the dirichlet problem at infinity for @xmath0 is not solvable .",
    "for this manifold ancona discussed the asymptotic behaviour of brownian motion .",
    "in particular , he showed that brownian motion almost surely exits from @xmath0 at a single point @xmath105 on the sphere at infinity .",
    "ancona did not deal with the question whether @xmath0 carries non - trivial bounded harmonic functions .",
    "borbly @xcite gave another example of a cartan - hadamard manifold with curvature bounded above by a strictly negative constant , on which the dirichlet problem at infinity is not solvable .",
    "borbly does not discuss brownian motion on this manifold , but he shows using analytic methods that his manifold supports non - trivial bounded harmonic functions .",
    "this paper aims to give a detailed analysis of manifolds of this type and to answer several questions .",
    "it turns out that the manifolds of ancona and borbly share quite similar properties , at least from the probabilistic point of view . on both manifolds the angular behaviour of brownian motion degenerates to a single point , as brownian motion drifts to infinity .",
    "in particular , the dirichlet problem at infinity is not solvable .",
    "nevertheless both manifolds possess a wealth of non - trivial bounded harmonic functions , which come however from completely different reasons than in the pinched curvature case .",
    "since borbly s manifold is technical easier to handle , we restrict our discussion to this case .",
    "it should however be noted that all essential features can also be found in ancona s example .",
    "unlike borbly who used methods of partial differential equations to prove that his manifold provides an example of a non - liouville manifold for that the dirichlet problem at infinity is not solvable , we are interested in a complete stochastic description of the considered manifold . in this paper we give a full description of the poisson boundary of borbly s manifold by characterizing all shift - invariant events for brownian motion .",
    "the manifold is of dimension 3 , and the @xmath23-algebra of invariant events is generated by two random variables .",
    "it turns out that , in order to see the full poisson boundary , the attracting point at infinity to which all brownian paths converge needs to be `` unfolded '' into the @xmath106-dimensional space @xmath107 .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour of brownian motion on this manifold is in sharp contrast to the case of a cartan - hadamard manifold of pinched negative curvature .",
    "recall that in the pinched curvature case the angular part @xmath108 of @xmath12 carries all relevant information and the limiting angle @xmath109 generates the shift - invariant @xmath23-field of @xmath12 .",
    "all non - trivial information to distinguish brownian paths for large times is given in terms of the angular projection of @xmath12 onto @xmath40 , where only the limiting angle matters .",
    "as a consequence , any bounded harmonic function comes from a solution of the dirichlet problem at infinity , which means on the other hand that any bounded harmonic function on @xmath0 has a continuous continuation to the boundary at infinity .",
    "more precisely , denoting by @xmath110 the banach space of bounded harmonic functions on a cartan - hadamard manifold @xmath0 , we have the following result of anderson .",
    "let @xmath11 be a cartan - hadamard manifold of dimension @xmath111 , whose sectional curvatures satisfy @xmath112 for all @xmath29 . then the linear mapping @xmath113 is a norm - nonincreasing isomorphism onto @xmath110 .    in the situation of borbly s manifold brownian motion almost surely exits from the manifold at a single point of the sphere at infinity , independent of its starting point @xmath63 at time @xmath82 . in particular , all harmonic measures @xmath77 are trivial , and harmonic functions of the form @xmath114 are necessarily constant . on the other hand , we are going to show that this manifold supports a huge variety of non - trivial bounded harmonic functions , necessarily without continuation to the sphere at infinity .",
    "it turns out that the richness of harmonic functions is related to two different kinds of non - trivial exit sets for the brownian motion :    \\1 .",
    "non - trivial shift - invariant information is given in terms of the direction along which brownian motion approaches the point at the sphere at infinity . even if there is no contribution from the limiting angle itself , angular sectors about the limit point allow to distinguish brownian paths for large times .",
    "brownian motion converges to a single point , in appropriate coordinates the fluctuative components ( martingale parts ) of brownian motion for large times are relatively small compared to its drift components . roughly speaking",
    ", this means that for large times brownian motion follows the integral curves of the deterministic dynamical system which is given by neglecting the martingale components in the describing stochastic differential equations .",
    "we show that this idea can be made precise by constructing a deterministic vector field on the manifold @xmath0 such that the corresponding flow induces a foliation of @xmath0 and such that brownian motion exits @xmath0 asymptotically along the leaves of this foliation .    to determine the poisson boundary the main problem is then to show that there are no other non - trivial exit sets .",
    "this turns out to be the most difficult point and will be done by purely probabilistic arguments using time reversal of brownian motion . to this end ,",
    "the time - reversed brownian motion starting on the exit boundary and running backwards in time is investigated .",
    "it is interesting to note that on the constructed manifold , despite of diverging curvature , the harmonic measure has a density ( poisson kernel ) with respect to the lebesgue measure . recall that in the pinched curvature case the harmonic measure may well be singular with respect to the surface measure on the sphere at infinity ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for results in this direction ) .",
    "typically it is the fluctuation of the geometry at infinity which prevents harmonic measure from being absolutely continuous .",
    "pinched curvature alone does in general not allow to control the angular derivative of the riemannian metric , when written in polar coordinates .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ section2 ]",
    "we give the construction of our manifold @xmath0 which up to minor technical modifications is the same as in borbly  @xcite : we define @xmath0 as the warped product @xmath115 where @xmath116 is a unit - speed geodesic in the hyperbolic space @xmath117 of constant sectional curvature @xmath118 and @xmath119 is one component of @xmath120 .",
    "the riemannian metric @xmath121 on @xmath0 is the warped product metric of the hyperbolic metric on @xmath119 coupled with the ( induced ) euclidean metric on @xmath122 via the function @xmath123 , @xmath124 by identifying points @xmath125 and @xmath126 with @xmath127 and @xmath128 and choosing the metric `` near '' @xmath116 equal to the hyperbolic metric of the three dimensional hyperbolic space @xmath129 the manifold @xmath0 becomes complete , simply connected and rotationally symmetric with respect to the axis @xmath116 .",
    "we specify conditions the function @xmath130 has to satisfy in order to provide a complete riemannian metric on @xmath0 for which the sectional curvatures are bounded from above by a negative constant , and such that the dirichlet problem at infinity is not solvable . as the construction of the function @xmath130",
    "is described in detail in @xcite we mainly sketch the ideas and refer to borbly for detailed proofs .",
    "we explain which properties of @xmath130 influence the asymptotic behaviour of the brownian  paths .",
    "the probabilistic consideration of the manifold @xmath0 starts in section  [ section3 ] .",
    "we specify the defining stochastic differential equations for the brownian motion @xmath12 on @xmath0 , where we use the component processes @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 of @xmath12 with respect to the global coordinate system @xmath134 for @xmath0 .",
    "the non - solvability of the dirichlet problem at infinity is then an immediate consequence of the asymptotic behaviour of the brownian motion ( see theorem [ bmconverges ] ) .",
    "it is obvious that the asymptotic behaviour of the brownian motion on @xmath0 is the same as in the case of the manifold of ancona . in particular , it turns out that the component @xmath131 of the brownian motion @xmath12 almost surely tends to infinity as @xmath94 .",
    "it is a remarkable fact that in contrast to the manifold of ancona , where the brownian motion almost surely has infinite lifetime , we can show that on @xmath0 the lifetime @xmath73 of the brownian motion is almost surely finite .    in section [ nontrivialshiftinvariant ]",
    "we start with the construction of non - trivial shift - invariant events . to this end",
    ", we consider a time change of the brownian motion such that the drift of the component process @xmath131 of @xmath12 equals @xmath20 , i.e.  such that the time changed component @xmath135 behaves then comparable to the deterministic curve @xmath136 . we further show that for a certain function @xmath137 , the process @xmath138 almost surely converges in @xmath139 when @xmath140 .",
    "it turns out that the non - trivial shift - invariant random variable @xmath141 can be interpreted as one - dimensional angle which indicates from which direction the projection of the brownian path onto the sphere at infinity attains the point  @xmath142 .",
    "the shift - invariant random variable @xmath143 indicates along which surface of rotation @xmath144 inside of @xmath0 the brownian paths eventually exit the manifold  @xmath0 .",
    "thereby @xmath145 is the trajectory starting in @xmath146 of the vector field @xmath147    section [ section5 ] finally gives a description of the poisson boundary .",
    "the main work in this part is to verify that there are no other invariant events than the specified ones .",
    "this is achieved by means of arguments relying on the time - inversed process .    as a consequence a complete description of",
    "all non - trivial bounded harmonic functions on the manifold @xmath0 is obtained .",
    "concerning `` boundary harnack inequality '' the class of non - constant bounded harmonic functions shares an amazing feature : on any neighbourhood in @xmath0 of the distinguished point at the horizon at infinity , a non - trivial bounded harmonic function on @xmath0 attains each value lying strictly between the global minimum and the global maximum of the function .",
    "finally it is worth noting that our manifold also provides an example where the @xmath23-field of terminal events is strictly bigger than the @xmath23-field of shift - invariant events .",
