    "there is a phononic analog of the usual casimir effect , but it tends to be quite small . for example , the force on two parallel plates due to phonon zero point energy is smaller than that in the electromagnetic case by the ratio of the speed of sound in the fluid to the speed of light  @xcite .",
    "this ratio is typically of order @xmath0 .",
    "however , forces due to classical stochastic sound fluctuations have been discussed recently by several authors  @xcite , and can be larger . here",

    "the @xmath34 dependence of the scattering cross section can be viewed as the product of the @xmath35 dependence of rayleigh - brillouin scattering and one power of @xmath36 coming from the spectrum of zero point fluctuations in the fluid .",
    "the factor of @xmath37 represents the influence of the fluid on light propagation before and after the scattering process , and arises as a product of a factor of @xmath31 in the incident flux and a factor of @xmath38 in the density of final states  @xcite .",
    "because light travels through the fluid at speeds much greater than the sound speed , light scattering reveals a nearly static distribution of density fluctuations .",

    "although small in absolute terms , this is surprizingly large for a macroscopic quantum effect at room temperature .",
    "it is interesting to note that if one were to look only at the total brillouin cross section ( stokes plus anti - stokes ) , the zero point effect would be masked at high temperatures .",

    "if we introduce an impenetrable boundary into the fluid , the phonon field will satisfy neumann boundary conditions @xmath68 as a consequence of the impenetrability .",
    "thus there will be a casimir force on the boundaries which is analogous to the casimir force produced by electromagnetic vacuum effects .",
    "for example , consider two parallel plates , which will experience an attractive force per unit area of @xmath69 which is smaller than the electromagnetic case for perfect plates by a factor of @xmath70 , and is thus quite small in any realistic situation .    henceforth , we consider the local effect of boundaries on mean squared density fluctuations , and now define @xmath71 to be the change due to the presence of the boundary .",

    "the shifts in density fluctuations are at least in principle observable in light scattering experiments .",
    "our interest in the phononic analog model is inspired by the fact that the study of boundary effects in quantum field theory is an active area of research , and has given rise to some recent controversies in the literature  @xcite .",
    "one question is the nature of the physical cutoff which prevents singularities at the boundary .",
    "an example of the subtleties is afforded by the mean squared electric and magnetic fields near a dielectric interface . when the material is a perfect conductor , these quantities are proportional to @xmath72 , where @xmath64 is the distance to the interface .",
