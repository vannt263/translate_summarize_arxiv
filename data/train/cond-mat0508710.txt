    "feynman s path integrals @xcite represent a compact and rich formalism for dealing with quantum theories .",
    "they have proved to be powerful tools for investigating symmetries , deriving non - perturbative results , delineating connections between different theories and different sectors of theories .",
    "their flexibility and intuitive appeal have allowed us to generalize quantization to ever more complicated systems and have led to a rich cross fertilization of ideas between high energy and condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "today , they are used both analytically and numerically @xcite in many other areas of physics , in chemistry and materials science , as well as in quantitative finance @xcite .",
    "unfortunately we still have very little knowledge of the precise mathematical properties of path integrals . as a result",
    "only an extremely limited number of path integrals can be solved exactly .",
    "although the functional formalism has been instrumental for deriving many general approximation techniques , along with a host of model - specific approximations , there remain many models of interest that need to be treated numerically ( e.g. using monte carlo simulations ) .",
    "numerical integrations of path integrals have , however , proven to be notoriously demanding of computing time . for this reason several research groups have worked at improving the convergence of path integrals . until recently the best available result for partition functions of a generic @xmath3-fold",
    "discretized theory led to a @xmath4 convergence @xcite .",
    "a new systematic analysis of the relation of discretizations of different coarseness @xcite has made it possible to dramatically improve convergence for general transition amplitudes , not just partition functions .",
    "a result of this investigation has been a procedure for constructing a series of effective actions @xmath5 having the same continuum limit as the starting action @xmath6 , but which approach that limit as @xmath2 .",
    "explicit expressions for these effective actions have so far been constructed for @xmath7 @xcite . in the current paper",
    "we will build on this derivation ( and simplify it to some extent ) and will cast the new analytical input in the form of a generalized euler summation formula for path integrals .",
    "it is our belief that the existence of such a general formula strongly hints at the possibility of ( currently unseen ) simplifications that might make it possible to set up a rigorous theory of path integration . in section [ sec : ordinary ] we present a simple derivation of euler s summation formula for ordinary integrals as a useful guide to the generalization to path integrals that is given in sections [ sec : general ] and [ sec : euler ] .",
    "the current status of the development of the path integral formalism is quite similar to that of ordinary integrals before the setting up of integration theory by riemmann . in those days",
    "integrals were calculated directly from the defining formula , i.e. one looked at a specific discretization of the integral ( darboux sum ) , attempted to do the sum explicitly , and finally tried to calculate the continuum limit .",
    "for example , @xmath8\\equiv \\int_0^t f(t)dt = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}i_n[f]\\ , \\,\\mbox{where}\\quad i_n[f]=\\sum_{n=1}^n f(t_n)\\epsilon_n\\ , \\ ] ] @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "it goes without saying that done this way , even the simplest ordinary integrals presented a challenge .",
    "the mathematicians of the 18th century did not have computers at their disposal or the development of integration theory might have come much later , i.e. they might have succumbed to doing brute force numerical calculations of integrals of all but the simplest functions .",
    "the problem with these hypothetical numerical calculations would have been two fold : they would have been inefficient ( the discretized sums converge slowly to the continuum value ) , and they would have worked ( thus quite probably slowing down the further development of integration theory ) . luckily , this early numerical road was not open .",
    "the last great step in the development of integration before riemmann was made by euler .",
    "discretization is not unique .",
    "this makes it possible to change @xmath11 to some other function ( adding terms proportional to @xmath12 , @xmath13 , etc . ) without changing the integral .",
    "let us assume that @xmath14 is such an equivalent function with the added property that the sums @xmath15 $ ] do not depend on @xmath3 .",
    "in fact we shall present a way of explicitly constructing @xmath14 for any given @xmath11 .",
    "we first look at the simple case of @xmath16 . now",
    "@xmath17=\\sum_{n=1}^n \\epsilon_n = t\\ , \\ ] ] which is already @xmath3-independent . hence , in this case , all the additional terms vanish .",
    "note that @xmath14 is completely determined by the original function @xmath11 ( and by @xmath12 ) , so that the additional terms necessarily depend only on the derivatives @xmath18 , @xmath19 , etc .",
    "the second step is to take @xmath20 . in this case",
    "we get @xmath21=\\sum_{n=1}^n t_n\\epsilon_n=\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\,\\frac{t^2}{n^2}=\\frac{t^2}{2}+\\frac{t^2}{2n}\\ .\\ ] ] from this it follows that @xmath22=\\frac{t^2}{2}$ ]",
    ". therefore , up to @xmath19 and higher derivatives of @xmath23 that all vanish for linear @xmath11 , we have @xmath24 .",
    "we continue this procedure by looking at @xmath25 . in this case",
    "we find @xmath26=\\sum_{n=1}^n t_n^2\\epsilon_n=\\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}\\,\\frac{t^3}{n^3}=\\frac{t^3}{3}+\\frac{t^3}{2n}+\\frac{t^3}{6n^2}\\ .\\ ] ] it follows that @xmath27=\\frac{t^3}{3}$ ] . in terms of @xmath28 this gives @xmath29 .",
    "the additional terms now depend on higher powers of @xmath12 as well as on higher derivatives and are determined by considering @xmath30 $ ] , and so on . in this way we have constructed a procedure for finding @xmath14 for any given @xmath11 . remembering that @xmath15 $ ] does not depend on @xmath3 we find @xmath31 this is the well - known euler summation formula .",
    "we may also write it more compactly as @xmath32=i_n[f^{(p)}]+o(\\epsilon_n^p)\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the truncation of @xmath28 to the first @xmath0 terms .",
    "the euler formula gives the analytical relation between integrals and their discretized sums .",
    "looked at numerically , this formula allows us to increase the speed of convergence of discretized expressions to the continuum limit .",
    "for example , in the defining relation the discretized expressions differ from the continuum by a term of order @xmath34 .",
    "by using the euler sum formula with @xmath0 terms we can reduce that error to @xmath35 .",
    "all that is needed to do this is that the integrand is differentiable @xmath36 times .",
    "the following sections we will generalize the above approach to path integrals .",
    "in the functional formalism the quantum mechanical amplitude @xmath37 is given in terms of a path integral which is simply the @xmath38 limit of the @xmath39 fold integral expression @xmath40 the euclidean time interval @xmath41 $ ] has been subdivided into @xmath3 equal time steps of length @xmath9 , with @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "@xmath44 is the naively discretized action of the theory .",
    "we focus on actions of the form @xmath45 whose naive discretization is simply @xmath46 where @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 .",
    "we use units in which @xmath50 and particle mass equal 1 .    as was the case with ordinary integrals",
    "the definition of the path integrals also makes it necessary to make the transition from the continuum to the discretized theory , a process that is far from unique . for theories described by eq .",
    "( [ action ] ) we have the freedom to choose any point in @xmath51 $ ] in which to evaluate the potential without changing physics ",
    "the discretized amplitudes do differ , but they tend to the same continuum limit .",
    "the calculations we present turn out to be simplest in the mid - point prescription where the potential @xmath52 is evaluated at @xmath53 . a more important freedom related to our choice of discretized action has to do with the possibility of introducing additional terms that explicitly vanish in the continuum limit .",
    "actions with such additional terms will be called effective .",
    "for example , the term @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is regular when @xmath56 , does not change the continuum physics since it goes over into @xmath57 , i.e. it vanishes as @xmath13 .",
    "such terms do not change the physics , but they do affect the speed of convergence .",
    "a systematic study of the relation between different discretizations of the same path integral will allow us to explicitly construct a series of effective actions with progressively faster convergence to the continuum .",
    "before we do this we will parallel the derivation in the previous section and derive some general properties of the best effective action .",
    "the amplitude @xmath58 of some theory with action @xmath6 satisfies @xmath59 for all @xmath3 .",
    "this general relation is a direct consequence of the linearity of states in a quantum theory . in analogy with ordinary integrals",
    "let us now suppose that there exists an effective action @xmath60 that is equivalent to @xmath6 ( i.e that leads to the same continuum limit for all path integrals ) with the additional property that its @xmath3-fold discretized amplitude @xmath61 does not depend on @xmath3 , i.e. that satisfies @xmath62 as was the case in the previous section we will in fact construct a general procedure for evaluating this effective action . for actions of the form given in eq .",
    "( [ action ] ) we may write the amplitude as @xmath63 where the reduced amplitude @xmath64 as @xmath65 . writing @xmath66 as @xmath67 and using eq .",
    "( [ amplituden ] ) , ( [ linearity ] ) and ( [ stardef ] ) we find @xmath68 note that @xmath69 is reminiscent of some effective potential , so it should depend on @xmath53 , however , from the above relation we see that it must also depend on @xmath70 .",
    "in addition , @xmath71 also has an explicit dependence on the discrete time step @xmath12 , hence @xmath72 as we have seen , the above functional form is a direct consequence of the linearity of quantum theory .",
    "the equivalence of @xmath6 and @xmath60 implies that @xmath73 when @xmath12 and @xmath74 go to zero .",
    "the final general property of @xmath71 follows from the reality of amplitudes in the euclidean formalism . using the hermiticity of the hamiltonian we find @xmath75 . in terms of @xmath71",
    "this gives us @xmath76 or , said another way , only even powers of @xmath70 are present in the expansion of @xmath71 : @xmath77 all the functions @xmath78 are regular in the @xmath79 limit .",
    "the link to the starting theory is now simply @xmath80 as @xmath12 goes to zero .",
    "this concludes the general properties of @xmath71 .",
    "the remaining properties will be analyzed in the following section by studying the relation of discretizations of different coarseness .",
    "we start by studying the relation between the @xmath81-fold and @xmath3-fold discretizations of the same theory . from eq .",
    "( [ amplituden ] ) we see that we can write the @xmath81-fold amplitude as an @xmath3-fold amplitude given in terms of a new action @xmath82 determined by @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the @xmath81-fold discretization of the starting action .",
    "we have written the @xmath81-fold discretized coordinates @xmath85 in terms of @xmath86 s and @xmath87 s in the following way : @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "note that we have @xmath42 , @xmath43 , while the @xmath90 remaining @xmath86 s play the role of the dynamical coordinates in the @xmath3-fold discretized theory .",
    "the @xmath87 s are the @xmath3 remaining intermediate points that we integrate over in eq .",
    "( [ tildes ] ) .",
    "it is not difficult to see that if we use the naively discretized action @xmath44 one obtains for @xmath82 an expression that is not of the same form as @xmath44 .",
    "having in mind the results of the previous section it is best to use the effective action @xmath91 which gives the same result for both the @xmath81-fold and @xmath3-fold discretizations .",
    "therefore , in this case we get @xmath92 from this one easily finds @xmath93 where @xmath94    the above integral equation can be solved for the simple cases of a free particle and a harmonic oscillator , and gives the well known results .",
    "note however that for a general case the integral in eq .",
    "( [ integral ] ) is in a form that is ideal for an asymptotic expansion @xcite . the time step @xmath12 is playing the role of small parameter ( in complete parallel to the role @xmath50 plays in standard semi - classical , or loop , expansion ) .",

    "all that remains is to calculate these expressions using eq .",
    "( [ f ] ) and to expand all the @xmath78 s around the mid - point @xmath53 .",
    "this is a straight forward though tedious calculation . in this paper",

    "we also disregarded all the higher @xmath78 s .",
    "the reason for this is that the short time propagation of any theory satisfies @xmath104 while the @xmath78 term enters the action multiplied by @xmath105 . in general , if we wish to expand the effective action to @xmath106 we need to evaluate only @xmath102 ( up to @xmath107 ) and the remaining @xmath36 functions @xmath78 ( up to @xmath108 ) .",
    "the task of calculating the effective action to large powers of @xmath12 is time - consuming and is best done with the help of a standard package for algebraic calculations such as mathematica . using mathematica we determined the corresponding expressions for @xmath7 .",
