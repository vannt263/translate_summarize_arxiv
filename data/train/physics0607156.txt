    "in this section , we present some practical techniques for measuring the spring constant @xmath13 and diffusion coefficient @xmath18 of a harmonically confined brownian particle .",

    "we will continue to treat the measured position as an unweighted time average of the true position over the integration time @xmath2 ( eq .  ( [ eq : measured_bead_position ] ) ) , which is consistent with the experimental results for our detection system .",
    "in other situations , e.g. if the rise and fall time are not negligible relative to the exposure time , these equations and ideas can be readily generalized as noted in section([sec : calculation_section ] ) .",
    "if the diffusion coefficient @xmath18 of the confined particle and the integration time @xmath2 of the instrument is known , the correct spring constant @xmath13 can be directly obtained from the measured variance @xmath58 by using equation [ eq : measuredvar2 ] .",
    "if the tracking error @xmath59 is significant , @xmath45 should first be subtracted from the measured variance as in equation [ eq : measuredvar_werror ] . while we can",
    "not in general isolate @xmath13 in this transcendental equation , it can easily be found numerically by utilizing a standard root - finding method .",
    "alternatively , an approximate closed form solution for @xmath13 is derived in appendix [ appendix : k_approx ] .      even if the data acquisition rate of the system is not fast enough to permit a blur - corrected power spectrum fit ( as described in appendix [ appendix : powerspec ] ) , @xmath13 and @xmath18 can still be determined by measuring the variance at different shutter speeds and fitting to the blur - corrected variance function .",
    "this technique is demonstrated in the experimental results section , and yields accurate measurements provided the integration time is not too much larger than the trap relaxation time ( @xmath15 is not much larger than 1 ) .",
    "practically speaking , this is a useful technique , as the maximum shutter speed of a camera is often much faster than the maximum data acquisition speed ( e.g. it is much easier to obtain a video camera with a 0.1 ms shutter speed than a camera with a frame rate of 10 khz ) .",
    "furthermore , this approach for quantifying the power spectrum from the blur is quite general , and could be used in other systems .",
    "as long as the form of the power spectrum is known , the model parameters could be determined by measuring the total variance over a suitable spectrum of shutter speeds .",
    "other approaches are possible if the confinement of the particles can be varied in a controlled way , i.e. by varying the laser power of the optical trap .",
    "if the spring constant varies linearly with laser power , ( which is typically true and was confirmed for our system in subsection([sec : experimentalresults ] ) ) , the first observation is that the spring constant only needs to be measured at a single laser power , as it can be extrapolated to other laser powers .",
    "typically calibration should be done at a low power , as this usually increases the accuracy of both the power spectrum fit and the blur correction technique .",
    "linearity between the spring constant and laser power can be further exploited to determine both @xmath13 and @xmath18 by measuring the variance of a trapped bead at different laser powers but with the same shutter speed .",

    "when using these motion blur techniques to characterize the dynamics of confined particles , we reiterate that it is the shutter speed and not the data acquisition speed that limits the dynamic range of a measurement .",
    "thus , even inexpensive cameras with fast shutter speeds can make dynamical measurements without requiring the investment of a fast video camera .",
    "alternative methods for controlling the exposure time are the use of optical shutters or strobe lights .",
