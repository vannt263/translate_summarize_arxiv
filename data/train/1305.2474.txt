    "the post - main - sequence evolution of massive stars depends sensitively on the helium core mass and its ratio to the envelope mass , which in turn depends on still poorly understood phenomena such as mixings in the radiative layers ( core overshooting and rotational mixing ) and wind mass loss .",
    "recent evolution models with a solar metallicity of @xmath1 by @xcite indicate that a star with a sufficiently large initial mass undergoes a blue - red - blue ( or blue - loop ) evolution before central helium exhaustion ; i.e. , the star ignites he in the center in the blue supergiant ( bsg ) stage , evolves to the red - supergiant ( rsg ) region , and returns to the blue supergiant ( bsg ) region during core he - burning .",
    "the lowest initial - mass for the blue - red - blue evolution depends on the degree of mixing in radiative layers and the strength of wind mass loss .",
    "@xcite s results indicate the lower bound to be about 20m@xmath0 .",
    "the mass limit is lowered if higher mass - loss rates in the rsg phase is assumed @xcite .",
    "thus , luminous bsgs consist of two groups having different evolution histories : one group are evolving red - wards just after the termination of main - sequence , while another group have evolved back from the rsg stage .",
    "the bsgs belonging to the latter group have significantly reduced envelope mass and the surface is contaminated by the cno - processed matter due to a dredge - up in the rsg stage and a significant mass loss .",
    "the fraction of each group depends on the internal mixing in the radiative layers and the strength of stellar wind and metallicity . in other words",
    ", if we can distinguish the two kinds of bsgs , it would be very useful for constraining the mixing in radiative layers and wind parameters .",
    "furthermore , the fraction relates to the relative frequencies of different types of core - collapse supernovae such as iip , iil , iib , ib and ic ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the ratio of blue to red supergiants ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one way to distinguish the two groups is to obtain their surface abundances of the cno elements .",
    "this has been pursued intensively by many authors ; e.g. , the vlt - flame survey @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "although the majority of bsgs show enhanced n / c ratios , theoretical interpretations were somewhat hampered by the variety of rotation velocities which yield various degree of internal mixings in the main - sequence stage , and possible effect of close binaries and magnetic fields .",
    "we propose , in this paper , another way to distinguish the two groups of bsgs by using stellar pulsation ; i.e. , we will argue that if they show ( radial ) pulsations , they must have been red supergiants before .",
    "it is known that many luminous ( @xmath3 ) ba - supergiants in our galaxy and magellanic clouds show micro variations in luminosity and in radial velocities ; they are called @xmath2-cygni variables ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , @xcite found that a fraction of blue supergiants in the galaxy ngc300 are such variables and at least two of those show clear radial pulsation properties .",
    "the ngc300 bsgs would be particularly useful for constraining evolutionary models , because of the homogeneity of the data and less ambiguities in luminosity .",
    "the pulsation not only provides us with diagnostic means , it might also have effects on stellar winds from massive stars , as @xcite found a relation between episodic changes in mass loss and the 37day pulsation of the luminous blue supergiant hd 50064 .",
    "they suggested that the pulsation is a radial strange - mode pulsation , which we confirm in this paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : evolution models of massive stars and the excitation of radial pulsations in these models are discussed in  2 .",
    "the properties of radial and nonradial pulsations and their excitation mechanisms are discussed in  3 . in ",
    "4 we compare observed semi - periods of @xmath2-cygni variables with theoretical ones and discuss surface compositions .",
    "our conclusion is given in  5 .",
    "evolutionary models have been calculated by the geneva evolution code with the same input physics as those described in @xcite .",

    "this comes from the requirement that the pulsation period should be comparable to the thermal timescale at the zone where the @xmath19-mechanism works ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . at high luminosity ,",
    "the instability boundary is nearly horizontal .",

    "are excited between the red - boundary of the @xmath9 cephei instability region and the cepheid blue - edge , because @xmath24 is not sufficiently large for the strange mode mechanism to work .",
    "models with @xmath14m@xmath0 return to the bsg region ( blue - loop ) from the rsg region before core - helium exhaustion .",
    "radial pulsations are excited in the models on the blue - loop ; this is due to the fact that a significant mass is lost in the rsg stage and hence the @xmath24 ratio has increased considerably ( fig.[fig : mass ] )",
    ". we can identify @xmath2 cygni variables ( especially if radial pulsations are involved ) to be core - helium burning stars on the blue - loop returned from the rsg stage .",
    "however , the luminosity of the track for @xmath25 is still too high to be consistent with the distribution of @xmath2 cygni variables on the hr diagram .",
    "the discrepancy can be solved by taking into account rotational mixing @xcite , or assuming a strong mass loss caused by roch - lobe overflow in the rsg stage .",
    "we consider the effect of rotational mixing in this paper .",
    "we have calculated evolution models for @xmath26 , and 14m@xmath0 with rotational mixing , and examined the stability of radial pulsations for those models .",
    "the ways to treat rotation and the mixing are the same as @xcite ; the rotation speed was assumed to be 40% of the critical one at the zero - age main - sequence stage .",
    "the results are shown in fig.[fig : mass ] .",
    "the rotational mixing makes helium core and hence luminosity larger in the post main - sequence evolution for a given initial mass",
    ". a smaller ratio of the envelope to core mass makes the red - ward evolution faster ; i.e. , less he is consumed in the first bsg stage .",
    "( note that dotted lines in the bottom panel of fig.[fig : mass ] tend to lose more mass as a function of @xmath27 in the first crossing , indicating the evolution to be slow there without rotational mixing ) . also , the higher luminosity enhances stellar winds so that the star starts blue loop earlier , well before the central he exhaustion .",
    "we note that the important effect of rotation comes from the mixing that enlarges he core , but not from the centrifugal force . therefore",
    ", a similar evolution is possible even without including rotation if a more extensive core overshooting is assumed . for @xmath28 , for example , an extensive blue - loop occurs before he exhaustion if a core overshooting larger than @xmath29 is included without rotational mixings ; if a mass - loss rate is enhanced by a factor of 5 , for example , it occurs for a overshooting larger than @xmath30 .    the non - rotating evolutionary track of @xmath31m@xmath0 passes , in the first crossing , around the lower bound of the distribution of the @xmath2 cygni variables ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "however , it does not come back to blue region even if rotation is included with our standard parameters .",
    "it does make a blue loop as shown in fig.[fig : mass ] , if the rate of cool winds is increased by a factor of five as in @xcite .",
    "such an increase is reasonable since there are many theoretical and observational arguments of sustaining higher mass loss rates during the red supergiant phase . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", @xcite have studied the consequence of a pulsation driven mass loss during the red supergiant phase .",
    "they showed that using empirical relations between the pulsation period and the mass loss rates , the mass loss rates could be increased by quite large factors largely exceeding a factor 5 at least during short periods .    from an observational point of view",
    ", the circumstellar environment of red supergiants clearly indicates that some stars undergo strong mass loss outbursts .",
    "for instance , vy cma ( m2.5 - 5iae ) which has a current mass loss rate of 2 - 4 10@xmath32m@xmath0 per year @xcite is surrounded by a very inhomogeneous nebula likely resulted from a series of episodic mass ejections over the last 1000 yr @xcite .",
    "it is estimated that the mass loss rates between a few hundred and 1000 yr ago was 1 - 2 10@xmath33m@xmath0 per year , thus between 2.5 and 10 times greater than the present rate .",
    "we also note that mass loss rates obtained by @xcite for dust enshrouded red supergiants are larger by a factor up to 10 compared with the rates estimated from the empirical relations given in @xcite in the present standard computation we used the prescription by @xcite .",
    "the arguments above indicate that using mass loss rates increased by a factor 5 is not beyond the uncertainty in our present state of knowledge on the mass loss rates of red supergiants .",
    "it is interesting to note that for the case of 14m@xmath0 not all models on the blue - loop excite pulsations .",
    "more precisely , no radial modes are excited in the blueward evolution at @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) . only in the second redward evolution ( third crossing )",
    ", a radial mode is excited around similar effective temperature ; this time , models have slightly higher @xmath24 ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "the fact that no @xmath2 cygni variables are observed below a luminosity limit of about @xmath37 does not necessarily means that stars below that limit have no blue - loop .",
    "even if they make a blue - loop evolution , their @xmath24 ratio would be too small for pulsations to be excited .",
    "the observed properties of @xmath2 cygni variables can be well explained if these stars are core he - burning stars on the blue - loop .",
    "this supports the presence of considerable mixing and possibly cool winds stronger than adopted in @xcite .",
    "note that an increased mass loss during the rsg phase seems to be also required in order to reproduce the observed positions of @xmath2 cyg variables at high luminosity .",
    "( indeed , the models in @xcite have a mass - loss rate increased by a factor of 3 for models more massive than 20m@xmath0 during the rsg phase )",
    ".    from the ratio of the evolution speeds between the first ( red - ward ) and second ( blue - ward ) crossings we can estimate the probability for a bsg to be on the first crossing . at positions of typical bsgs , rigel and deneb ( see table[tab : param ] below ) , for example , the probabilities are 45% and 98% , respectively , for @xmath38 , while they are 15% and 50% or @xmath39 ; in both cases rotational mixings are included .",
    "if we use models without rotation , the probabilities are nearly unity for both stars and for both initial masses , because in this case the second crossings occur very swiftly after the core he exhaustion .",
    "in this section we discuss the properties and excitations of radial and nonradial pulsations in bsg models with rotational mixing .",
    "although these models start with 40% of the critical rotation at the zero - age main - sequence stage , the rotation speeds in the envelopes in all the supergiant models are very low as discussed in appendix , so that we did not include the rotation effects in our pulsation analyses .      in our linear pulsation analysis ,",

    "the real part @xmath42 gives the pulsation period ( @xmath43 ) and the imaginary part @xmath44 gives the stability of the pulsation mode ( excited if @xmath45 ) .",

    ". filled circles indicate excited modes , while ` @xmath52 ' and ` + ' are damped modes . in the top panel , the normalized frequency of each mode varies regularly as a function of @xmath6 , keeping the order such that the lowest frequency is the fundamental mode ( f ) with no node in the amplitude distribution , next one is the first overtone ( 1ov ) with one node , and so on .",

    "a very low frequency mode which appears in the range @xmath54 of the top panel is a mode associated with thermal ( damping ) wave , so that it is strongly damped .",
    "the symbol + is used in fig.[fig : omega ] for strongly damped modes with @xmath55 ( modes with @xmath56 are not plotted ) .    in models with high @xmath24 ratios as shown in the bottom panel of fig.[fig : omega ] , the frequencies of thermal modes enter into the frequency range of dynamical pulsations , and @xmath57 decreases ( the damping time becomes longer ) so that the two types of pulsations become indistinguishable .    in the bottom panel of fig.[fig : omega ] for models on the blue - loop , at least one mode is excited throughout the @xmath27 range ( three modes are excited in most part ) .",
    "the frequency of each mode varies in a more complex way ; the mode ordering rule is lost , additional mode sequences appear , and frequent mode crossings occur , etc .",
    "the appearance of such complex behaviors is related with strange modes .",
    "the strange modes may be defined as modes which are not seen in adiabatic analyses . with this definition",
    "the thermal damping modes also belong to strange modes , but we are more interested in another type of strange modes which are excited by a special instability even when the thermal time goes to zero which was first recognized by @xcite .",
    "( we will discuss the mechanism briefly below ) .",
    "sequence s2 in fig.[fig : omega ] corresponds to such a strange mode .",

    "the two sequences is connected in the rsg stage , which is not shown in fig.[fig : omega ] .",
    "the s1 mode , as discussed below , seems to be excited mainly by enhanced @xmath19-mechanism at the fe - opacity bump .",
    "the main difference between the models in the top and in the bottom panels of fig.[fig : omega ] is the luminosity to mass ratio ; models in the bottom panel ( on the blue - loop ) have @xmath59 , while in the top panel @xmath60 .",
    "a higher @xmath24 ratio makes pulsations more nonadiabatic .",
    "this can be understood from a linearized form of energy conservation for stellar envelope ; @xmath61 where @xmath10 means the lagrangian perturbation of the next quantity , @xmath62 is the entropy per unit mass , and @xmath63 .",
    "the above equation indicates that generally a high value of @xmath24 generates a large entropy change and hence large nonadiabatic effects .",
    "a large @xmath24 ratio has also a significant effect on the envelope structure by enhancing the importance of radiation pressure . combining a hydrostatic equation with a radiative diffusion equation for the envelope of a static model",
    ", we obtain a relation @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the gas pressure , @xmath66 is the total pressure , @xmath19 is the opacity in units of @xmath67 , and @xmath68 is the local radiative luminosity .",
    "this equation indicates that the inward increase of the gas pressure is hampered or inverted if @xmath69 , and the effect is strong where the opacity is large . a radiation pressure dominated zone is formed around an opacity peak in the stellar envelope with a @xmath24 ratio larger than @xmath70 .",

    "both stars have similar effective temperatures , but the radius of a10 ( 142r@xmath0 ) is smaller than that of d12 ( 191r@xmath0 ) due to the luminosity difference ; i.e. , the smaller star has the longer period .",

    "the lagrangian mass coordinate corresponding to @xmath179 is @xmath180 , so it means that for the core to contain 60% of the mass , the star must lose about @xmath181 .",
    "we can thus expect that a blue star that has evolved from the rsg stage should exhibit very high n / o and n / c ratios . _",

    "@xcite lists ( y , n / c , n / o)= ( 0.32 , 3.4 , 0.65 ) for deneb and ( 0.37 , 2.0,0.46 ) for rigel .",
    "these numbers are rather consistent with models before the rsg stage , in contradiction with our conclusion that they should rather be stars having evolved through a rsg stage .",
    "so we are left here with a puzzle : pulsation properties tell us that these two stars should be bsg evolved from a rsg stage , while surface abundances indicate that they should be bsg having directly evolved from the ms phase .",
    "in other words , in order to have the excited modes compatible with the observations of deneb and rigel , a high @xmath24 ratio is needed , which , in turn , implies strongly changed n / c and n / o ratios which are not observed .",
    "so we are left with a real puzzle here . at this point",
    "we can simply mention three directions which may help in resolving this discrepancy :    \\1 ) are we sure that all the frequency measured correspond to pulsation process ?",
    "for instance , some variations could be due to some other type of instabilities at the surface . in this case",
    ", the vertical lines associated to rigel and deneb in fig.[fig : teperi ] representing the observed pulsation period ranges might be reduced and be compatible with stars on their first crossing .",
    "\\2 ) it would be extremely interesting to obtain accurate measurements of the n / c and n / o ratios at the surface of the stars listed in table[tab : param ] other than rigel and deneb to see whether the case of deneb and rigel are representative of all these stars or not .",
    "in particular , measurements of surface cno abundances of the two radial pulsators a10 and d12 in ngc300 are most interesting .",
    "\\3 ) recently some authors @xcite find that the rsg have significantly higher effective temperatures and are hence more compact for a given luminosity . from another perspective , @xcite find that to reproduce the light curve of type ii - p supernovae , the rsg progenitor should be more compact than predicted by current models .",
    "the effective temperature of the rsg stars depends on the physics of the convective envelope .",
    "for instance , depending whether turbulent pressure is accounted for or not and how the mixing length is computed , much bluer positions for the rsg stars can be obtained ( see e.g. fig . 9 in * ? ? ?",
    "one can wonder whether more compact rsg stars would need to lose as much mass as larger rsg stars to evolve to the blue part of the hr diagram .",
    "would the blue supergiants resulting from the evolution of more compact rsg stars present the same chemical enrichments as those presented by the current models ?",
    "we shall investigate these questions in a forthcoming work .",
    "we have studied the pulsation properties of bsg models . in the effective temperature range between the blue edge of the cepheid instability strip and the red - edge of the @xmath9 cephei instability range , where many @xmath2 cygni variables reside ,",
    "radial ( and most of nonradial ) pulsations are excited only in the models evolving on a blue - loop after losing significant mass in the rsg stage .",
    "the observed quasi periods of @xmath2 cygni variables are found to be roughly consistent with periods predicted from these models in most cases .",
    "this indicates that the @xmath2 cygni variables are mainly he - burning stars on the blue - loop .",
    "however , it is found that the abundance ratios n / c and n / o on the surface seem too high compared with spectroscopic results .",
    "further spectroscopic and photometric investigations for bsgs are needed as well as theoretical searches for missing physics in our models .",
    "furthermore , it would be interesting to explore the circumstellar environments of those stars that are believed to have evolved from a rsg stage . some of those stars may still have observable relics of the slow and dusty winds that they emitted when they were red supergiants .",

    "for models including rotation effects , the initial rotation speed is assumed to be 40% of the critical rate at the surface of the zero - age main - sequence models .",
    "although the rotation speed is considerable during the main - sequence stage , it decreases significantly in the envelopes of supergiant models because of the expansion and mass loss .",
    "fig.[fig : rot ] shows runs of angular frequency of rotation in two bsg models having similar effective temperatures ; one ( blue lines ) is evolving toward the red supergiant stage and one ( red lines ) evolving on the blue loop after the red supergiant stage . in this figure , each rotation profile , @xmath183 , is normalized by two different quantities ; @xmath184(solid line ) and @xmath185(dashed line ) .",
    "the solid lines indicate that in both models the mechanical effect of rotation on the stellar structure is small because it is much smaller than the local gravity throughout the interior ; i.e. , @xmath186 .",
    "the dashed lines in fig.[fig : rot ] indicate rotation frequency itself normalized by the global parameters in the same way as the normalized pulsation frequency shown , e.g. , in fig.[fig : omega ] .",
    "although the rotation frequency is very high in the core of a supergiant , in the envelope it is much smaller than the pulsation frequencies ; @xmath187 for radial pulsations ( fig.[fig : omega ] ) and @xmath188 for nonradial oscillatory convection modes in the same normalization .",
    "since these pulsations are well confined to the stellar envelope ( @xmath189 , see figs.[fig : work3 ] and [ fig : nradwork ] ) , rotation hardly influence the pulsation property in these supergiant models .",
    "this justifies our pulsation analyses without including the effect of rotation ."
