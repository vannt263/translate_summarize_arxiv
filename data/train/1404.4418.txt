    "the new controversy in the value of the hubble constant @xmath6 determined from local and global measurements raised a lot of activity to pin down evidence of new physics or unaccounted systematic errors .",
    "while a local measurement with cepheids and type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) derived @xmath10 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 @xcite , the planck collaboration @xcite determined @xmath11 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 within a flat @xmath8 cold dark matter ( @xmath8cdm ) model from temperature anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "many systematic errors may be responsible for the difference .",
    "concerning local measurements , the first rung in the distance ladder is crucial for @xmath6 measurements .",
    "depending on what method is used to calibrate sne ia distances , a variety of values is derived for @xmath6 .",
    "for example , @xcite used three distance indicators to calibrate the sne ia : a geometric distance to ngc 4258 based on a megamaser measurement ; parallax measurements to milky way cepheids ( mwc ) and cepheids observations and a revised distance to the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) . revising the distance to ngc 4258 from @xcite , with only this indicator @xcite used @xcite data to get @xmath12 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 , while combining the three indicators the value is @xmath13 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 , alleviating the tension . on the other hand , calibrating the sne with the tip of the red giant branch ( tgrb ) @xcite obtained @xmath14 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 .",
    "this is very intriguing since many local determinations obtained higher values for @xmath6 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the systematic errors may also come from the cmb analysis .",
    "for example , @xcite claim that the 217 @xmath15 217 ghz detector can be responsible for some part of the tension , where its removal provides @xmath16 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 .",
    "moreover , an inconsistency of the _ planck _ data with a flat @xmath8cdm model was claimed by @xcite , where a lack of power for high and low multipoles may indicate new physics or systematic errors .    on the new physics side , it could be just cosmic variance @xcite ; if we live in a ` hubble bubble ' we would infer a higher local value for @xmath6 compared to the global one .",
    "this possibility requires a very unlikely size for the void , although it is compatible with observations @xcite .",
    "other possibilities include extensions of the cosmic concordance model @xcite or massive neutrinos @xcite .",
    "one way to avoid local effects is to go to intermediate redshifts .",
    "based on a non - parametric reconstruction of @xmath17 data , @xcite extrapolated the reconstruction to redshift 0 and obtained @xmath18 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 , independent of a cosmological model .",
    "conversely , by adopting a flat @xmath8cdm model , @xcite determinations within a cosmological model , ( e.g. @xcite ) . ] used four different probes at intermediate redshifts , namely , angular diameter distances ( add ) from galaxy clusters , 11 ages of old high - redshift galaxies ( ohrg ) , 18 @xmath17 data points and baryon acoustic oscillations ( baos ) peak .",
    "they obtained @xmath19 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 . while the former value is consistent with _ planck _",
    ", the latter points to an internal inconsistency inside the @xmath8cdm model , since both _ planck _ and lc values were derived assuming the same model .",
    "it is worth mentioning that lc used the bonamente et al .",
    "( 2006 ) galaxy clusters sample , modelled by a non - isothermal spherical double @xmath20 model .",
    "however , the standard spherical geometry has been severely questioned , since _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations have shown that galaxy clusters exhibit preferably an elliptical x - ray surface brightness ( fox & pen 2002 ; jing & suto 2002 ; sereno et al .",
    "2006 ; morandi et al .",
    "2010 ; limousin et al .",
    "moreover , this sample was found to be inconsistent with the so - called cosmic distance duality ( dd ) relation ( holanda , lima & ribeiro 2010,2011,2012 ; meng et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "therefore , the goal of this paper is to analyse the robustness of lc results by performing two kinds of tests .",
    "first , we search for systematic errors considering a sample where the morphology of galaxy clusters , used to derive their distances , was assumed as isothermal spherical and elliptical .",
    "also , we test different assumptions for the incubation time @xmath21 used in the ohrg analysis to see the impact to @xmath6 .",
    "secondly , we change the cosmological model to see its dependence on the results , where we consider a curved @xmath8cdm model and a flat xcdm model . as we shall see , the @xmath6 value is very weakly dependent on the cosmological model .",
    "in contrast , the cluster morphology changes the result sizeably , being the main source of systematic errors , which means that this source must be controlled in order to claim that this method is a powerful cross - check for @xmath6 .",
    "the letter is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we introduce the mathematical background and the models adopted in this work .",
    "3 is devoted to a description of the samples used in the statistical analyses .",
    "4 presents the results and sec .",
    "5 closes the paper with the conclusions .",
    "in this letter , we consider two cosmological scenarios : ( 1 ) the so - called @xmath8cdm model , but allowing deviations from flatness , and , ( 2 ) the flat xcdm model , where the universe is flat and driven by cdm@xmath22 plus a dark energy component @xmath23 with constant equation - of - state ( eos ) parameter @xmath24 . throughout",
    "we use units such that the light speed @xmath25 .    by considering the universe described by a homogeneous and isotropic friedmann  lematre  robertson ",

    "on the other hand , the age - redshift relation , @xmath35 , is given by @xmath36 .",
    "for the cosmological models adopted in this letter , @xmath37 reads @xmath38 , where @xmath39 .",
    "we consider two cases : a @xmath8cdm model with @xmath40 and a flat xcdm model with @xmath41 .",
    "in order to have a reliable comparative study with the lc results , the only difference between their and our cosmological probes it is the addition of the de filippis et al . sample ( 2005 ) . summarizing , in this letter",
    "we use the following .",
    "\\(a ) three samples of add from galaxy clusters obtained from their sunyaev  zeldovich and x - ray observations ( the so - called esz / x - ray technique ) .",
    "the first one , used in lc , composed of 38 add in redshift range @xmath42 compiled by bonamente et al .",
    "( 2006 ) where the cluster plasma and dark matter distributions were analysed assuming a non - isothermal spherical double @xmath20 model .",
    "this model generalizes the single @xmath20 model proposed by cavaliere & fusco - fermiano ( 1978 ) . summarizing",
    ", the cluster plasma and dark matter distributions were analysed assuming a hydrostatic equilibrium model and spherical symmetry , accounting for radial variations in density , temperature and including the possible presence of cooling flow .",
    "the new samples used here are formed by 18 galaxy clusters from de filippis et al .",
    "( 2005 ) in the redshift range @xmath43 .",
    "these authors re - analysed archival x - ray data of the _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ satellites of two samples ( mason et al .",
    "2001 ; reese et al . 2002 ) for which combined x - ray and sze analysis have already been reported . in the reanalysis",
    "were used two models to describe exactly the same clusters : the isothermal elliptical and spherical @xmath20 models , providing two add samples , named from now on , samples i and ii , respectively .",
    "it is important to comment that , in general , different cluster gas profiles do not affect the inferred central surface brightness ( @xmath44 ) or central sunyaev ",
    "zeldovich decrement ( @xmath45 ) , but give different @xmath46 ( the core radius ) .",
    "de filippis et al .",
    "( 2005 ) found , for instance , @xmath47 ( in first approximation ) , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the core radius obtained by using an isothermal elliptical @xmath20 model and an isothermal spherical @xmath20 model , respectively , and @xmath50 is the axial ratio of the major to the minor axes of the projected isophotes .",
    "since @xmath51 , different core radius affect the esz / x - ray distances and , consequently , the @xmath6 estimates ( see fig . 1 in de filippis et al .",
    "thus , for these single @xmath20 models , @xmath26 obtained by the spherical model is overestimated compared with the elliptical one .",
