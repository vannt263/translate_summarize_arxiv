    "the sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sunyaev and zeldovitch @xcite , s.z . in the following ) is a spectral distortion of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) due to inverse compton scattering of cmb photons by hot electrons in clusters of galaxies .",
    "it consists of a flux decrement at millimetre and centimetre wavelengths and a flux increment at shorter wavelengths . if the temperature of the electron gas is determined independently , for instance from the xray spectrum , then the knowledge of both parts of the s.z .",
    "effect can provide information about the intracluster gas mass ( thermal effect ) , and on its peculiar velocity with respect to the hubble flow ( kinetic effect ) .",
    "recent calculations which fully take into account the relativistic effects , have shown that for the hottest clusters , @xmath0 , the s.z .",
    "spectrum significantly departs from the sunyaev and zeldovich result ( see e.g. rephaeli et al .",
    "this temperature dependence of the s.z .",
    "spectrum is particularly important in the submillimetre domain .",

    "data , independently of any xray measurement .    the comparison of the cluster s xray flux with the amplitude of the s.z .",
    "thermal effect allows to derive the cluster s angular distance and thus the hubble constant .",
    "this method is fully independent of the classical distance - scale determination .",
    "number of measurements of the decremental part at millimetre or centimetre wavelengths have been successfully achieved from the ground and allowed determinations of peculiar velocities or @xmath1 ( see for instance birkinshaw et al .",

    "the determination of the clusters peculiar velocity is performed at wavelengths near 1.4 mm , where the thermal effect is close to zero . at this wavelength",
    "the dust emission of galactic cirrus or extragalactic starbursts can be significant and polutes the measurement .",
    "only infrared / submillimeter observations can raise this degeneracy .",
    "we report in this paper such measurements for the cluster abell 2163 .",
    "this is a well studied massive cluster located at @xmath2 , which has one of the hottest known intracluster gas temperatures ( @xmath3 , elbaz et al .",
    "@xcite and markevitch et al .",
    "@xcite ) . this makes it a very attractive candidate for measurements of the s.z . effect .",
    "high sensitivity measurements of the s.z .",
    "effect on this cluster have been obtained at 1.1 , 1.4 and 2.1 mm using the suzie caltech photometer on the cso ( holzapfel et al .",
    "the submillimetre data presented here were obtained with the pronaos telescope ( serra et al .",
    "@xcite ) during a 30-hour stratospheric flight from fort sumner ( n.m . ) on september the 22nd and 23rd , 1996 .",
    "the 2-metre primary dish of the instrument is a 6-element segmented mirror with active control of the shape to compensate for inflight thermal and gravity changes .",
    "the spm photometer ( lamarre et al .",
    "@xcite ) includes warm optics providing the sky modulation and internal regulated black - body calibrators .",
    "the detector system uses bolometers cooled at 0.3 kelvin with closed cycle @xmath4 coolers inside a liquid @xmath5 cryostat .",
    "there are 4 spectral bands at 170 - 240 @xmath6 , 240 - 340 @xmath6 , 340 - 540 @xmath6 , 540 - 1050 @xmath6 with beams of 2 , 2 , 2.5 , and 3.5 arcmin ( channels 1 to 4 respectively ) .",
    "the optical scheme uses dichroics so that a single direction on the sky is observed in the four channels simultaneously .",
    "our observation strategy includes three levels of beam modulation to subtract the instrumental systematic signals and their possible variations : i ) beam switching at constant elevation , with a 6-arcmin amplitude , at a frequency of 19.5 hz , ii ) telescope nodding so that the source is alternately seen in the positive and negative beams , at a frequency of about 0.01 hz , iii ) repeating the observation on a blank field , with the same duration and observing mode .",
    "the blank field was selected in the neighborhood of the cluster , for minimum dust contamination in the iras 100@xmath7 maps ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "five positions are observed in the direction of the cluster : one at the nominal cluster centre ( maximum x - ray brightness ) and the other four at 1.6-arcmin offsets in elevation and cross - elevation from this centre ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this strategy was chosen to cope with possible miss - pointing of the telescope ( which did not occur ) and to provide information on the cluster extension in case of a high signal - to - noise detection . a2163 and the reference field were each observed for a total duration of 54 minutes .",
    "the sensitivities achieved in flight by the pronaos - spm system are 1.0 , .58 , .17 and .06 mjy / sr respectively in the four channels , for s / n=1 and an observation time of 1 hour . the noise level in channels 1 and 2",
    "is dominated by low frequency fluctuations likely to be due to residual atmospheric emissions .",
    "these fluctuations are still important in channel 3 , but can be efficiently removed by correlation with channel 1 and subtraction of the correlated component .",
    "the residual noise level is then about 0.09 mjy / sr in channel 3 , which , together with the noise in channel 4 , is close to what is expected from photon noise .",
    "the calibration is performed in four steps : i ) ground based calibration of the photometer on extended blackbodies at different temperatures , ii ) ground based measurement of the bands spectral responses , iii ) inflight measurement of the instrument beam on the planet saturn , and iv ) inflight monitoring of the detector response on an internal modulated reference source ( a detailed description of the noise analysis and calibration procedures will be published in a forthcoming paper by pajot et al . ) .",
    "the resulting absolute calibration accuracy has been estimated to be of order 10% . finally ,",
    "for each analysed source the calibration coefficients are re - computed in a self consistent manner , integrating the bandpass over the best estimate of the source s spectrum : e.g. dust plus s.z . effect in the case of a2163 .",
    "the data processing includes : i ) data deglitching and filtering , ii ) demodulation from telescope nodding : @xmath9 , iii ) averaging . before averaging , channels",
    "3 and 4 were cross - correlated with channel 1 to subtract any correlated noise component .",
    "the correlation ratios found are @xmath10 and @xmath11 in jansky units .",
    "these color ratios are much smaller than the cosmic dust emission colors , which will be the main contributor to the flux measured in channel 1 : @xmath12 and @xmath13 for dust at 15 k with a spectral index of 2 . however , as this decorrelation process also implies some subtraction of the dust component from channels 3 and 4 , the average data values were self - consistently corrected using the final dust best fit spectrum ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "maps at 90 @xmath6 and 180 @xmath6 were obtained with the phot instrument on board the iso satellite , ( open time program : gserra : szclust ) .",
    "the observation mode was a phot-32 8x8 raster map with steps of 92 arcsecond and integration times of 20 and 64 seconds per pixel ( pixel sizes are 43 and 90 arcsec respectively for the 90@xmath7 and 180@xmath7 filters ) .",
    "the data reduction was performed with the pia-7.01 software . in order to get consistent data allowing us to derive the dust emission , the pronaos observing sequence was simulated with its parameters -beam switching and beam size- on the iso maps ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the results of these simulated measurements are reported in table [ table1 ] with the corresponding error bars ( see also fig . [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the error bars have been derived from the rms fluctuation taken on a map of residuals .",
    "this map was obtained by subtraction of the large scale cirrus pattern fitted as a 5 degree 2d polynomial .",
    "the error bar obtained in this manner is always larger than the phot absolute calibration uncertainty ( 10 to 20 % ) .",
    "the same operation was performed on the iras issa map at 100 @xmath15 .",
    "although the spatial modulation for pronaos and suzie is not exactly the same , the simulations using the 180@xmath7 iso - pht data show that the dust signal is the same within error bars .",
    "thus a single dust signal is used in the interpretation of the data .",

    "it was not necessary to assume a prior probability for any of the four parameters .",

    "effect in a2163 made with significantly different beam sizes , 3.5 , 1.9 and 0.5 arcmin respectively for pronaos , suzie and diabolo . within the error bars , the three measurements give the same value for the comptonization parameter in the direction of the cluster center .",
    "this validates the king profile that has been derived from the x - ray analysis for the intracluster gas distribution , for a cluster radius ranging from 0.4 to 5 times the core radii .",

    "( @xcite ) from the analysis of the suzie data at 1.1 , 1.4 and 2.1 mm : @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "however in their analysis the authors assumed a zero dust emission level , which is not realistic given the far infrared measurements .",
    "the iso map in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] clearly shows that this cluster , which is at medium galactic latitude , lies behind a significant layer of galactic dust ( about 25 mjy / sr at 180 @xmath6 ) .",

    "this figure displays the 68% and 95% confidence contours on @xmath22 and @xmath21 , including ( and not including ) the far infrared and submillimetre data in the fit : full lines ( dashed lines ) . in the second case ( dashed line ) the parameters of the dust component",
    "have been varied in the following range : @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "this is a plausible range considering the average depth of the cirrus cloud in the direction of a2163 : @xmath37 from the xray data ( elbaz et al .",
    "@xcite ) , or @xmath38 from 21 cm surveys ( dickey and lockman @xcite ) .",
    "we use the infrared to @xmath39 colors from boulanger et al .",
    "( @xcite ) : @xmath40 at @xmath41 .",
    "although it remains within the previous error bars , the velocity change induced by taking into account the dust contribution implies a slight decrease in @xmath21 .",
    "this is because the kinetic s.z .",
    "effect contributes about 10% of the measured decrement at 2.1 mm , the wavelength where the thermal s.z .",
    "effect is mostly constrained by the data .",
    "the combined data set ( submillimetre plus millimetre ) only slightly improves the precision of the comptonization parameter since the accuracy of the pronaos measurement of the positive s.z .",
    "effect ( s / n = 3 to 4 ) is much less than that of the suzie measurement at 2.1 mm ( s / n = 10 ) .",
    "concerning the derivation of @xmath1 by comparison of the comptonisation parameter with x - ray fluxes , this scales as @xmath42 .",
    "thus , the @xmath43 value derived using the same isothermal model for the cluster gas distribution as holzapfel et al .",
    "( @xcite ) increases from @xmath44 to @xmath45 with our determination of @xmath21 .",

    "measurements and more generally millimetric cmb data . at this stage we are not able to assess the origin of the submillimetre dust emission towards a2163 : i ) residual unbalanced galactic dust as assumed above , ii ) background starburst galaxies which can possibly be magnified by a gravitational lensing effect or iii ) intracluster dust as measured by stickel et al .",
    "( @xcite ) toward the coma cluster .",
    "this last hypothesis was carefully examined .",
    "data from iso - pht show that the measured flux depends on the orientation of the simulated beam switching , and that the mean of all possible orientations ( 1.5 @xmath46 detection ) does not provide a confirmation of a brightness excess towards the cluster .",
    "moreover , given the depth of the foreground cirrus cloud ( see above ) the hypothesis of contamination by galactic dust seems very likely .",
    "the case of a2163 , a massive cluster at medium galactic latitude , actually provides a good illustration of the problems that will be faced when interpreting data for more standard clusters at higher galactic latitudes ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 mjy / sr ) with the future very sensitive space borne instruments such as planck ( bersanelli et al .",
    "submillimetre capabilities , as provided by planck and first , will be required to derive meaningful peculiar velocities , and precisions below 10% on the comptonisation parameter . however , concerning the peculiar velocity , the fundamental limitation will remain the cmb because it has the same spectrum as the s.z . kinetic effect",
    "( see e.g. haehnelt and tegmark @xcite and aghanim et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in a similar way",
    ", the analysis of the primordial cmb anisotropies themselves at high angular resolution ( @xmath49 ) from the planck 217 ghz channel , will also suffer from the dust contamination and require the help of the submillimetre channels .",
