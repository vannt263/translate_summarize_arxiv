    "the vela pulsar is also a strong source of non - thermal emission in the optical , x - ray and gamma - ray bands .",
    "the non - thermal component from the pulsar was resolved for the first time by _ chandra_@xcite .",
    "recent _ rxte _ observations revealed complex timing properties associated with non - thermal emission from the pulsar , showing energy - dependent multiple peaks in folded lightcurves @xcite",
    ". however , the origin of the peaks in the soft x - ray band , whether thermal or non - thermal , has yet to be determined .",
    "the _ xmm - newton_observation of the vela pulsar was performed with a 90 ksec exposure time on 1 dec 2000 . _ xmm - newton_is sensitive to faint sources such as isolated neutron stars due to its large effective area . since the nebula turned out to be compact @xmath6@xmath7 @xcite , the imaging capability of _ xmm - newton_cannot resolve the pulsar from the nebula .",
    "therefore , the thermal component dominates at @xmath8 kev and the nebula emission is dominant at @xmath9 kev in _ xmm - newton_spectra .",
    "we could not spatially resolve the non - thermal emission from the pulsar or study different components of the nebula .",
    "instead , using the _ xmm - newton_data , we did the following : ( 1 ) a spectral fit to high sensitivity europian photon imaging camera ( epic ) @xcite data was used to determine thermal properties with high accuracy , ( 2 ) a search for spectral features in high resolution reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs ) @xcite data was performed .",
    "all the data were processed by version 5.3.3 of the scientific analysis system ( sas ) pipeline @xcite .",
    "we analyzed epic - pn data to determine the global features of the x - ray spectrum .",
    "source data were extracted from a circular region with radius @xmath10 and events with ccd pattern 0 were selected .",
    "such a source area includes more than 90% of the source counts at energies up to @xmath11 5 kev .",
    "however , the extracted spectra are heavily contaminated by nebular emission at @xmath9 kev . unlike the recent _ chandra_results which resolved the pulsar emission from its nebula emission @xcite , our analysis focuses on thermal emission from the pulsar at @xmath12 kev .",

    ", we adopted a two - component model comprised of a thermal and non - thermal ( power - law ) spectrum .",
    "we applied two different thermal models to the data : a blackbody model ( bb+pl model ) and a magnetized hydrogen atmosphere model provided by v. zavlin @xcite at @xmath15 g ( h+pl model ) . when we fitted a hydrogen atmosphere model , we fixed the neutron star mass and radius to @xmath16 and 10 km .",

    "hydrogen atmospheres are in general harder than a blackbody since free - free absorption dominates in the x - ray band .",

    "the estimated luminosity of the power - law component in the epic - pn data is consistent with the _ chandra_result for the nebula ( @xmath33 ergss@xmath34 for @xmath29 pc ) @xcite .",
    "the derived parameters from both the blackbody and magnetized hydrogen atmosphere fit are in good agreement with the _ chandra_results . however , since the angular resolution of _ xmm - newton_is poorer than that of _ chandra _ , our fitting parameters can be affected by systematic errors due the the nebular contamination .",
    "these errors are , in general , larger than the statistical ones . in order to estimate such errors , we examined the variations in the hydrogen atmosphere and blackbody parameters by using as extraction regions annuli of various radii ; the errors reported in table 1 reflect both statistical and systematic uncertainties .",
    "we can see that , when considering the effect on the nebular contamination , _ chandra_and _ xmm - newton_temperatures are in agreement at 1-sigma level .",
    "reflection grating spectrometer data were taken in `` spectroscopy '' mode in order to take full advantage of the high spectral resolution .",

    "we extracted smaller regions of the source ( 50% and 70% psf region ) to maximize the number of thermal photons compared to nebular emission photons .",
    "figure 3 shows rgs spectra extracted from the 70% psf region and fitted by the h+pl model .",
    "the data are plotted in the rgs bandpass ( @xmath35@xmath36  ) after rebinning wavelength grids to @xmath37 .",
    "the spectral fit by both the bb+pl and the h+pl model yield @xmath38 for both rgs 1 and 2 data .",
    "the fitted parameters were similar to the epic - pn results in table 1 .",
    "several deviations from the continuum fit with less than 2 sigma significance are seen , but none of these wiggles were found in both rgs 1 and 2 data simultaneously .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the rgs spectra are featureless .",
    "the results obtained with _ xmm - newton_for the vela pulsar are in agreement with previous findings by _ chandra_@xcite .",

    ", with respect to a fit with the simple blackbody , the atmospheric model has the advantage that it gives a radius for the emitting region compatible with neutron star equations of state . also , when _",
