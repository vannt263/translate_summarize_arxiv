    "describing the matter produced in ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions with a limited set of global variables is a tantalising task . in fact , the challenge is not only a description of the matter created under such extreme conditions but also an understanding of the details of its evolution .",
    "it is fair to say that stunning progress has occurred in the last couple of years , as it is reflected in the latest results presented during this edition of the quark matter conference . a significant fraction of the discussions focused on the shape of the initial energy density of the collision in terms of fluctuations .",
    "such a picture is now constrained by extremely precise measurements of the azimuthal anisotropy of emitted particles as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : fluid_dynamics ] .",
    "a fairly detailed `` standard model '' for the dynamical evolution of a heavy - ion collision emerges and is explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : modelling ] .",
    "recently , lattice qcd calculations have made tremendous progress in eliminating systematic uncertainties . as explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : lattice ] , various groups now agree on the value of the critical temperature for the chiral transition within systematic and statistical uncertainties , and on the value of the interaction measure at high temperature to within 25% . section  [ sec : chemical_thermal ] is dedicated to recent experimental estimates of chemical and thermal freeze - out variables : statistical thermal analyses are performed on hadron abundances and comparisons are made for nuclei and hyper - nuclei as well .",
    "baryon - to - meson ratios in the intermediate @xmath0 region are studied at rhic and lhc in order to investigate hadronisation mechanisms involving parton recombination .",
    "blast - wave fits to hadron @xmath0-spectra are used to extract thermal freeze - out conditions as a function of collision centrality and beam energies .",
    "we conclude our review of global observables and fluctuations with an outlook towards further key questions that need to be addressed in the near future .",
    "the fluid - dynamical description for the bulk dynamics of heavy - ion collisions received a tremendous boost in interest with the measurement of elliptic flow at rhic , showing that fluid dynamics could quantitatively describe the collective flow of matter and coining the paradigm of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) being the `` most perfect liquid '' ever created .",
    "later , fluctuation measurements were perceived as a handle on both initial state as well as transport properties of matter produced ( first as a strongly interacting qgp ",
    "sqgp  and then as a hadron gas ) .",
    "currently , we are at the crossroads where state - of - the - art modelling of initial conditions meets extremely precise experimental measurements of fluctuations .",
    "this is spectacularly illustrated by the presentation of b.  schenke with the  real ( conference ) time \" matching of the atlas event - by - event ( ebye ) flow fluctuations for the anisotropic flow coefficients @xmath1  @xcite by the impact - parameter saturated ( ip - sat ) glasma modelling of the initial conditions  @xcite , followed by 3 + 1dimensional ebye relativistic viscous fluid - dynamical evolution with music  @xcite .",
    "one of the striking features is that both @xmath0 and centrality differential @xmath2 distributions from atlas  @xcite and alice  @xcite , respectively , are correctly reproduced with a single value of the shear viscosity over entropy density ratio @xmath3 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .     for two different centrality classes  @xcite , right panel as a function of centrality percentile  @xcite .",

    "@xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ]    such a value is consistent with the quantification of the systematical uncertainties performed by m.  luzum and for which the  conservative \" range of @xmath4 is obtained  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is a major achievement that ip - sat  glasma initial conditions manage to reconcile @xmath5 and @xmath6 contrarily to mc - glauber or mc - kln initial energy density distributions for lhc energies .",
    "moreover , with ultra - central collisions ( @xmath7 ) recorded and selected by cms  @xcite as well as with the studies of correlations between measured event - plane angles , one can expect new challenges for models and other insights into the fluctuations of the initial energy density .",
    "the main conclusions from the extraction of @xmath8 with the beam energy scan ( bes ) data at rhic are similar but bring further constraints : when comparing to models , a low @xmath9 is always favoured ( i.e. , close to @xmath10 ) but the @xmath0-differential @xmath11 measured by star seems to increase progressively up to @xmath12 with increasing beam energy @xmath13  @xcite . with the addition of particle identification ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 ) up to @xmath18 at @xmath19 , phenix reports an ordering for @xmath20 with the same pattern than what is seen for @xmath5 and no beam energy dependence for @xmath0-differential @xmath20 for each particle species in a 2060@xmath21 centrality interval  @xcite .",
    "although the analyses require more statistics , a significant effort is made by the experimental collaborations at rhic and lhc to perform @xmath5 estimates with higher cumulants in order to isolate non - flow and fluctuation contributions . in parallel of the well - known fact that the @xmath0-integrated @xmath5 increases by @xmath12 from top rhic to lhc energies  @xcite",
    ", it is underlined that the @xmath0-differential @xmath5 extracted with the 4-particle cumulant method stays close in the range @xmath22 from lower bes rhic to lhc energies  @xcite . concerning the lhc studies",
    ", it is also reported that ( i ) for all collision centralities , the measurements of integrated @xmath23 and @xmath11 do not change if one uses @xmath24- or @xmath25-particle cumulant methods ( similarly to what was noticed for @xmath5 ) ; ( ii ) although @xmath11 shows also an increase with @xmath0 , and then saturates around @xmath26 , its centrality dependence is smaller than the one of @xmath5 ( to be expected if initial density fluctuations are indeed at the origin of @xmath11 )  @xcite .",
    "it is important to mention here the excellent agreement between different experiments when comparing @xmath27 obtained with the @xmath24-particle cumulant method  @xcite .     vs.  @xmath28 with @xmath29  24 ( from left to right ) for @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16+@xmath17 , in central ( 050@xmath21 )",

    "several possibilities were investigated for finding a universal scaling for produced hadrons as a function of their number of constituent quarks ( @xmath30 ) : ( i ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ncq_scaling ] , phenix presented @xmath31 vs.  @xmath28 for @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16+@xmath17 which seems to hold for several harmonics ( i.e. , @xmath29  24 for au  au collisions at @xmath19 ) and several collision energies  @xcite ; ( ii ) star reported that @xmath32 vs.  @xmath33 works for most identified particles and up to top rhic energies except an intriguing 2-@xmath34 deviation for the @xmath35 meson at the lowest energies of @xmath36 and @xmath37  @xcite ; ( iii ) no scaling seems to hold up to lhc energies  @xcite .",
    "the `` standard model '' for the dynamical evolution of hot and dense strongly interacting matter created in ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions is the following : ( i ) individual parton - parton collisions copiously create gluons and quarks .",
    "the initial points of production are computed within various approaches .",
    "some possibilities are the standard glauber model for nucleon - nucleon collisions , the kln model  @xcite , or the ip - glasma model  @xcite which combines the impact - parameter saturation ( ip - sat ) model for the initial nuclear wave functions @xcite with the classical yang - mills dynamics of the produced color fields ( `` glasma '' )  @xcite . in a monte - carlo implementation of these models ,",
    "initial conditions fluctuate from event to event . for an illustration",
    ", we show the transverse energy density profile at a time @xmath38 after the collision in fig .",
    "[ fig : inicond ] .",
    "the ip - sat model shows fluctuations on the smallest scales , followed by the kln model .",
    "the glauber model has the smoothest initial conditions , i.e. , the smallest fluctuations .",
    "how these initial conditions evolve further and on which time scale thermalization is achieved is presently not clear .",
    "calculations within @xmath39 theory @xcite show that actually thermalization ( i.e. , establishing an equation of state ) is achieved prior to isotropization ( i.e. , equality of transverse and longitudinal pressure ) , cf .  left panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : phi4_intmeas ] .",
    "this may necessitate the use of anisotropic fluid dynamics @xcite .",
    "commonly , one assumes a rather rapid approach to local thermodynamical equilibrium , so that fluid dynamics is applicable .",
    "the initial conditions for fluid dynamics are then specified on a hypersurface in space - time ( commonly a constant proper time surface @xmath40 ) . from then on ,",
    "the evolution of the system is determined by the conservation laws for net - charge and energy - momentum , @xmath41 for a unique solution , causal and stable formulations of dissipative fluid dynamics require in addition dynamical equations for the dissipative components of @xmath42 and @xmath43 . for a systematic derivation of these equations from kinetic theory ,",
    "see ref .  @xcite .",
    "if the microscopic interaction rates drop below the macroscopic expansion rate of the fluid , a fluid cell will not be able to sustain ( approximate ) local thermodynamical equilibrium any longer ; the cell `` freezes out '' .",
    "this freeze - out process is commonly performed along a hypersurface of constant temperature  @xcite . how to compute the single - inclusive particle spectra in the presence of viscous terms",
    "was also reported at this conference  @xcite .",
    "the subsequent evolution of the system is either performed via a microscopic `` afterburner '' which takes into account elastic ( and possibly inelastic ) collisions between individual particles before they hit the detector ( see , e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite ) , or one simply assumes complete cessation of microscopic interactions .",
    "then , one simply computes the single - inclusive particle spectra along the freeze - out hypersurface in order to compare with experimental data . despite the apparent crudity of the underlying assumptions ,",
    "the latter procedure is remarkably successful in reproducing the measured harmonic flow coefficients for charged particles , cf .",
    "[ fig:1 ] where they are shown for a calculation within relativistic dissipative fluid dynamics  @xcite with ip - glasma initial conditions and a constant shear viscosity - to - entropy density ratio of @xmath44 .",
    "one observes nearly perfect agreement for all flow coefficients for all centrality classes , except the most central one where the elliptic flow coefficient @xmath27 somewhat exceeds the experimental values .",
    "as outlined in the former section , there remains a large uncertainty in the choice of initial conditions for fluid - dynamical calculations .",
    "thus , there is little hope in being able to perform a reliable determination of the equation of state ( and probably also of the transport coefficients ) from experimental flow data . in this situation ,",
    "lattice qcd ( lqcd ) remains the most important , and moreover quantitatively reliable , tool to provide microscopic input for fluid - dynamical calculations .",
    "there has been considerable progress in the past year : lqcd calculations from the hotqcd and wuppertal - budapest collaborations now agree on the value of ( pseudo-)critical temperature for chiral symmetry restoration : @xmath45  @xcite vs.  @xmath46  @xcite . regarding the equation of state , one of the most important ( systematic ) uncertainties that remain to be resolved resides in the interaction measure .",
    "as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : phi4_intmeas ] ( right ) , while the values of the hotqcd collaboration agree fairly well with those of the wuppertal - budapest collaboration below @xmath47 , they are systematically larger by about 25% above @xmath47 .",
    "another important input in dissipative fluid - dynamical calculations are the transport coefficients .",
    "one would hope that , in the future , lqcd calculations of these quantities reach a similar precision as those for the equation of state . until then",
    ", one has to rely on more phenomenological approaches to extract values for @xmath9 and the other coefficients , see e.g.  @xcite .",

    "@xmath54 is fairly insensitive to the value of the baryochemical potential @xmath55 , so it can serve as a thermometer to determine the ( chemical ) freeze - out temperature .",

    "@xcite.,title=\"fig:\",width=188 ]   as function of @xmath58 ( left ) and @xmath56 as function of @xmath59 ( right ) , from ref .",
    "once the qgp cools down and chemical freeze - out occurs , hadron abundances are very close to the ones recorded with the experimental setups .",
    "statistical thermal model analyses of the hadron yields have been successfully describing the measurements on a large range of beam energies with few global variables only : the chemical freeze - out temperature @xmath60 , the baryo - chemical potential @xmath61 and the volume @xmath62 of the fireball .",
    "the star analyses of bes data at rhic offer the possibility to investigate not only the beam - energy but also the centrality dependence of these parameters  @xcite . for the lowest energies of @xmath63 and @xmath64 , the results of the fits for peripheral collisions seem to systematically depart parameter . ] from the phenomenological description of @xmath65 per hadron  @xcite .",
    "the parameter extrapolation from rhic to lhc energies is straightforward , since one expects @xmath60 to get closer to the deconfinement temperature @xmath47 of lqcd and @xmath61 to vanish with increasing beam energy .",
    "however , some tension appears with the alice data analysis  @xcite : proton and anti - proton yields are low with respect to calculations for a temperature of @xmath66 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : chemical_coal_thermal ] , left panel ) which may reflect the presence of annihilation during the hadronic phase .",
    "the importance of corrections for feed - down and secondaries from interactions with the detector material is underlined together with the benefit of vertex detectors for this purpose  @xcite .",
    "hypertriton and anti - hypertriton are measured not only at rhic but also at the lhc .",
    "using the bes data as well as the additional statistics of the 2012 run , the star collaboration manages to obtain the excitation function of the @xmath67 + @xmath68 @xmath0-spectra and refines the estimate of the lifetime @xmath69 with measurements in a larger decay length interval . a combined fit of 2010 + 2012 results gives : @xmath70  @xcite .",
    "although alice extracts clear signals for @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath71 , no h - dibaryon peak is observed and therefore , upper limits on the yields of this hypothetical particle are derived  @xcite .",
    "the observation of baryon / meson ratios at intermediate @xmath0 being significantly higher for top rhic energy au  au collisions as compared to pp triggered the development of models recombining quarks from the qgp phase to produce hadrons .",
