    "the one - dimensional ( 1d ) schrdinger equation including a symmetric potential structure produces single - particle wave functions of a definite parity , even or odd , with the ground state always corresponding to an even function without zeros .",
    "however , a spatially symmetric hamiltonian of an interacting many - particle system can give rise to asymmetric states , which may be considered as a spontaneous - symmetry - breaking ( ssb ) effect . at the classical level",
    ", the ssb occurs in optics , as a result of the interplay between the nonlinearity and waveguiding structures , when the strong nonlinearity partly suppresses the linear coupling between parallel guiding cores .",
    "in particular , it was shown that a stable trapped mode may be asymmetric in a channel waveguide embedded in the self - focusing kerr medium @xcite .",
    "the onset of a sharp symmetry - breaking instability in a double - hump two - component spatial optical soliton was demonstrated experimentally in a planar nonlinear waveguide @xcite .    a natural setting in which ssb phenomena may arise in the context of nonlinear optics and bose - einstein condensation ( bec )",
    "is provided by double - well potentials ( dwps ) . in the experiment ,",
    "an effective optical dwp was created by a specially designed illumination pattern applied , in the ordinary polarization , to a photorefractive crystal ( the ssb was observed in a beam with extraordinary polarization , shone through this structure ) zhigang .",
    "it was also proposed to realize similar effective potentials in coupled nonlinear microcavities @xcite , and in a structured core of an optical fiber @xcite .",
    "a specific variety of the optical ssb was studied in a model of two parallel - coupled antiwaveguides with the self - focusing nonlinearity , which corresponds to an effective double - barrier _ _  _ _ potential , rather than dwp @xcite .",
    "well - known dual - core optical fibers @xcite , which may serve as a basis for the power - controlled all - optical switching , if the kerr nonlinearity is taken into regard @xcite , may also be considered as dwp structures , with the difference that the tunneling between two potential wells is replaced by the linear coupling between the cores .",
    "in addition to the ssb of continuous - wave states @xcite , the formation of asymmetric solitons in dual - core fibers was studied in detail theoretically @xcite .",
    "similar analysis of the ssb for soliton modes was performed in models of dual - core fiber bragg gratings with the kerr nonlinearity @xcite , and coupled waveguides with the quadratic @xcite and cubic - quintic @xcite nonlinear terms , including a system of linearly coupled complex ginzburg - landau equations of the cubic - quintic type @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite ,  the analysis of the ssb was extended to three - core linearly coupled triangular configurations  for optical fibers , bragg gratings , and complex ginzburg - landau equations , respectively .",
    "the concept of ssb also plays an important role in understanding experimental phenomena in bec , because , if interactions between atoms are strong enough , the ground state of the condensate may not follow the symmetry of the trapping potential @xcite . in particular , manifestations of ssb were observed in a quenched ferromagnetic state of a spinor ( three - component ) condensate @xcite . in the single - component bec ,",

    "a condensate of @xmath0rb atoms with the repulsive interaction between them into this structure made it possible to observe josephson oscillations for a small number of atoms , and the macroscopic quantum self - trapping featuring an imbalance between populations of the two wells , for a larger number .",
    "parallel to the experimental work , numerous theoretical studies of matter - wave dwp  settings have been performed , for the cases of both repulsion and attraction between atoms .",
    "these studies addressed problems such as finite - mode reductions finite - mode ( including two - component mixtures @xcite ) , obtaining analytical results for specific shapes of the potential @xcite , quantum effects @xcite , and some others .",
    "recently investigated tunneling between vortex and antivortex states in bec trapped in a 2d anisotropic potential @xcite belongs to this category too .",
    "theoretical analysis was also performed for 2d and 3d extensions of the dwp settings in bec , which add one or two extra dimensions to the model , either without an additional potential , or with a periodic optical - lattice ( ol ) potential acting in these directions .",
    "these settings may be approximated , similar to the above - mentioned standard model of dual - core optical fibers , by a system of linearly coupled 1d @xcite or 2d @xcite equations . in a more accurate form , nearly-1d solitons can be found as solutions to the full 2d equation that includes the dwp ( the potential depends on the transverse coordinate , @xmath1 , allowing solitons to self - trap in the free longitudinal direction , @xmath2 ) @xcite .",
    "the latter model is relevant to the case of the self - attractive nonlinearity . in the case of self - repulsion",
    ", dual - core gap solitons have been be predicted in the setting with the ol potential applied along direction @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "note that , in any setting , gap solitons can not realize the ground state of the respective system , but , nevertheless , they represent stable configurations , that have been created in the experiment using the condensate of @xmath0rb atoms with the repulsion between them @xcite .",
    "a general principle , upheld by the analysis in various settings ( in nonlinear optics and bec alike ) , is that the ssb occurs through bifurcations of symmetric or antisymmetric states , in the models with the self - attraction and self - repulsion , respectively .",
    "as mentioned above , models of the dwp / double - core type , combining cubic attractive and quintic repulsive nonlinearities , were studied too @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "the competition between the self - focusing and self - defocusing against the backdrop of the dwp structure gives rise to specific ssb bifurcation diagrams , in the form of non - convex closed loops @xcite , as well as to specific dynamical switching regimes @xcite . also predicted were manifestations of the ssb in a two - component bec  mixture trapped in the dwp structure @xcite , for both cases of the self - attraction and self - repulsion .",
    "all the extensive work on the ssb outlined above was performed in settings based on usual linear potentials of the double - well type .",
    "the objective of the present work is to propose another physical framework , in which the ssb can be predicted in an effective _ nonlinear _ double - well potential ( ndwp ) , induced through a spatial modulation of the local nonlinearity coefficient . following the terminology commonly adopted in the solid - state theory @xcite",
    ", this nonlinear ingredient of the physical model may also be a called a _",
    "pseudopotential_.    in bec settings , a pseudopotential structure may be readily induced through spatial modulation of the local value of the @xmath3-wave scattering length , @xmath4 , which determines the effective bec  nonlinearity .",
    "the modulation can be implemented , through the feshbach resonance , by means of a spatially inhomogeneous dc magnetic field @xcite , or by a resonant optical field , as predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite and demonstrated experimentally in ref .",
    "it was also proposed to control the feshbach resonance by dint of dc electric field fr - electric , which can be easily made inhomogeneous too .",
    "the attractive and repulsive interactions between atoms correspond to @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively ; both signs , as well as sign - changing patterns , can be used to engineer effective nonlinear potentials .",
    "so designed pseudopotential lattices have attracted much interest in studies of bec . in the 1d geometry , solitons , extended wave patterns , and various dynamical states supported by such structures were studied theoretically @xcite ( a random nonlinear lattice @xcite and pseudopotentials generated by a spatially monotonous ramp of the local scattering length @xcite were explored too ) .",
    "recently , similar states were also considered in nonlinear optics , assuming a periodic modulation of the local kerr coefficient @xcite .",
    "some ( but much fewer ) results were obtained too for 2d settings @xcite .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , ssb phenomena in nonlinear pseudopotentials have not been studied yet . in this work ,",
    "we focus on such effects in ndwp settings , which can be engineered by means of techniques mentioned above , using attractive interactions between atoms in bec , or the self - focusing nonlinearity in optics , as briefly described below . in section",
    "ii , we formulate the model and give estimates of characteristic values of related physical parameters .",
    "section iii reports full analytical solutions corresponding to symmetric , antisymmetric , and _ asymmetric _ states trapped by the ndwp , in the limit case with the modulation of the local nonlinearity coefficient is represented by a set of two dirac s delta - functions .",
    "the relevance of the latter model is stressed , in particular , by the recently introduced @xcite bec model with a periodic nonlinear potential of the kronig - penney type , whose simplest version reduces to a periodic array of delta - functions ( ssb effects were not studied in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in section iv ,",
    "we present numerical results for the general model , in which the delta - functions are replaced by a pair of gaussians of a finite width . in that case , the trapped states are found in a numerical form , and their stability is studied by means of direct simulations of slightly perturbed stationary states and also , independently , through computation of respective stability eigenvalues for small perturbations .",
    "the result is that asymmetric states , which are unstable in the delta - function limit , can be readily stabilized in the general model .",
    "in addition , antisymmetric states may be stabilized too , in two disjoint regions of the parameter state , giving rise to a _ bistability _ involving antisymmetric and asymmetric states .",

    "close to the their stabilization threshold ( in particular , at @xmath174 ) , asymmetric states with a smaller norm , which are still unstable , demonstrate a scenario of the instability development different from what was shown by their counterpart in fig .",

    "the stabilization of the asymmetric states at small finite values of @xmath26 is explained by the change in the character of the ssb bifurcation : at @xmath177 , there appear turning points on branches of asymmetric solutions in the bifurcation diagram , cf .",

    "we do not display the quick transition from the sub- to supercritical bifurcation in full detail , as it actually happens at very small @xmath26 , in the range of @xmath178 .",
    "the physical estimates given in section ii suggest that so small values of the scaled width of the nonlinear - potential wells correspond to physical widths @xmath179 @xmath35 m .",
    "it seems doubtful that the feshbach - resonance technique would allow one to create a strong local inhomogeneity of the scattering length on such a small scale ( nevertheless , the exact analytical solutions obtained for @xmath90 , which provide clear clues for the understanding of the general model , are definitely relevant ) .",
    "an additional problem impeding the full analysis of the case of very small @xmath26 is that , in this case , the accumulation of systematic numerical results requires very heavy simulations , as the stepsize of the spatial grid must be made much smaller than @xmath26 .    above the bifurcation point ,",

    "another notable feature observed in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] is the _ bistability _ , i.e. , the coexistence of stable asymmetric and antisymmetric states above the stability border of the latter state .",
    "in fact , the bistability always takes place when antisymmetric states are stable .",

    "[ fig8 ] were identified by means of direct simulations and the computation of stability eigenvalues , both methods yielding identical results .",

    "[ newfig3 ] demonstrates that an unstable symmetric state definitely self - traps into an asymmetric robust breather ( which is close to a stable stationary solution ) , despite the fact that a stable antisymmetric state exists at the same values of @xmath181 and @xmath122 , as seen from fig .",

    "in this work , we have introduced a model of the nonlinear double - well potential ( ndwp ) , alias a double - well pseudopotential , which can be created in bec , by means of the spatially inhomogeneous feshbach resonance , and also in nonlinear optics .",
    "the model provides for a previoulsy unexplored setting in which effects of the spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) can be studied .    in the limit",
    "when each potential well is induced by the delta - function , full analytical solutions were obtained for symmetric , antisymmetric and asymmetric states .",
    "the symmetric states are stable in that case up to the symmetry - breaking bifurcation point , but beyond the bifurcation both symmetric and emergent asymmetric states are unstable .",
    "in particular , the asymmetric configurations transform themselves into breathers .",
    "the instability of all the stationary asymmetric states in the model with the delta - functions is explained by fact that the respective ssb bifurcation is of a  fully backward \" type , with branches of the asymmetric solutions never turning forward .",
    "all antisymmetric states are unstable too , in this limit form of the model .",
    "the increase of the width of the potential wells readily stabilizes the asymmetric states , which concurs with the change of the character of the ssb bifurcation from sub- to supercritical .",
    "close to the stabilization border , unstable asymmetric states develop slow intrinsic oscillations , featuring effective dynamical re - symmetrization .",
    "antisymmetric states may also be stable in the ndwp structure with a finite width of the wells , which implies the bistability between asymmetric and antisymmetric states .",
    "the symmetric states exist above a finite threshold , in terms of the norm ( number of atoms in the condensate ) , and they develop the usual ssb instability above the bifurcation point .",
    "a simple explanation to the existence threshold was given , and an integrated diagram for the existence and stability of the trapped states of all the three types has been produced .",
    "the analysis presented in this work suggests new experiments in the matter - wave and nonlinear - optical settings .",
    "the analysis can also be developed in other directions .",
