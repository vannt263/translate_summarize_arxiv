    "in a recent communication@xcitepuosi and leporini showed from computer simulations that the relevant high - frequency shear modulus controlling the relaxation is not the idealized shear modulus corresponding to affine deformations at truly infinite frequency .",
    "rather , it is the shear modulus referring to time scales that are on the one hand much shorter than any relaxation time , but on the other hand much longer than typical vibration times .",
    "this confirms findings by other groups.@xcite puosi and leporini further proposed an extension of the shoving model to allow for heterogeneities and showed that the new model fits simulation data very well .",
    "this extension is consistent with previous works by khronik _",
    "et al . _ , who introduced the idea of a distribution of local shear moduli to explain sub @xmath1 relaxations within the shoving - model framework.@xcite    commenting on the instantaneous shear modulus of the shoving model puosi and leporini wrote : `` it is quite apparent that @xmath0 , the central quantity of the standard elastic models , poorly correlates with the structural relaxation time . ''",
    "this conclusion derives from the understanding that the shoving model and related elastic models are based on the idealized affine infinite - frequency shear modulus , not the experimentally measurable high - frequency plateau modulus , which was traditionally used for comparing model to experiment .",
    "unfortunately , theorists and experimentalists have used for many years the same symbol , @xmath0 , for different physical properties . in experiment",
    "the term `` instantaneous shear modulus '' always meant the shear modulus at the highest obtainable frequencies ( typically mhz or ghz , or even high khz , depending on the technique used),@xcite where it generally becomes frequency independent and is usually  though not always  denoted by @xmath0 .@xcite in his excellent text book _ the dynamic properties of supercooled liquids _ from 1976 harrison refers to this quantity as `` the high - frequency limiting shear modulus''.@xcite likewise , whenever the maxwell relaxation time @xmath2 in the literature has been calculated for a liquid , @xmath0 was always identified as the experimental limiting high - frequency shear modulus of the plateau , much below phonon frequencies .    in liquid - state theory , @xmath0 was traditionally the idealized , truly infinite - frequency limit of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem expression,@xcite proportional to the mean - square shear - stress equilibrium fluctuation .",
    "previously , there was no reason to believe that these two quantities should differ in any significant way .",
    "it now turns out that for some systems , as temperature changes at constant density , one quantity increases and the other decreases.@xcite the purpose of the present paper is to show that the shoving model derivation assumes @xmath0 is the quantity , which puosi and leporini referred to as the plateau modulus.@xcite we suggest a consistent notation for the two instantaneous shear moduli , which can be used whenever there is a risk of confusing them.@xcite finally , we reanalyze data for a large selection of metallic glasses in order to compare to predictions of three versions of the shoving model .",
    "section ii reviews the shoving model , sec .",

    "v gives a brief summary .",
    "the shoving model for the non - arrhenius temperature dependence of the main ( alpha ) relaxation time @xmath3 of a glass - forming liquid predicts that @xmath4$].@xcite here @xmath5 is a prefactor of order 0.1 picosecond , @xmath0 is the `` instantaneous '' shear modulus , @xmath6 is a characteristic volume of order a molecular volume , @xmath7 is boltzmann s constant , and @xmath8 is the temperature . in order to minimize the number of free parameters , the shoving model assumes _ ad hoc _ that @xmath6 is temperature independent . in this way",
    "the model connects directly two experimentally measurable quantities , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the model does not consider what causes the unusually large temperature dependence of glass - forming liquids instantaneous shear moduli .",
    "this problem was addressed recently in interesting papers by brito and wyart , who proposed that the increase of the instantaneous shear modulus derives from a stiffening of the boson peak as temperature is lowered.@xcite    the shoving model and related elastic models have been confirmed for a number of organic , oxide , chalcogenide , oxynitride , and metallic liquids,@xcite , as well as in some computer simulations,@xcite but failures of the model have also been reported.@xcite most experimental conformations relate to a liquid s temperature - dependent equilibrium relaxation time , but there are also tests confirming the shoving and related elastic models for aging experiments.@xcite more data are certainly needed before it is clear whether the shoving and related models account generally for the non - arrhenius temperature dependence of @xmath3 observed in supercooled liquids . for reviews of elastic models",
    "the reader is referred to refs . and .",
    "the shoving model is based on the assumption that the main contribution to the activation energy for a `` flow event ''  a rearrangement from one potential energy minimum to another  is the work done in shoving aside the surroundings in order to increase the volume available for rearranging the molecules .",
    "the model assumptions are:@xcite    * the main contribution to the activation free energy is elastic energy . * this elastic energy is located in the surroundings of the rearranging molecules . *",
    "the elastic energy is shear elastic energy , i.e. , not associated with density changes .    to make things simple",
    ", the shoving model assumes spherical symmetry of a flow event and calculates the activation free energy as the work done in shoving aside the surroundings ( expanding a sphere ) in order to create room for a flow event .",
    "is it reasonable to assume that the main contribution to the activation energy comes from the surroundings ?",
    "what about contributions from the rearranging molecules themselves ?",
    "a simple argument shows that the former contribution dominates.@xcite suppose that rearranging at constant volume is energetically very costly because the molecules are forced into close contact during the rearrangement process ; this is the main physical idea of the shoving model . in this case , allowing for just a slightly larger volume for the rearranging molecules implies a considerable lowering of the energy cost .",
    "if the radius change is @xmath11 and the energy barrier contribution from the rearranging molecules within the sphere is @xmath12 , the total energy barrier involves a further quadratic contribution from deforming elastically the surroundings : @xmath13 .",
    "the fact that the function @xmath12 decreases significantly when @xmath11 increases slightly above zero is expressed mathematically as @xmath14 . optimizing @xmath11 in order to find the lowest barrier leads to @xmath15 .",
    "thus the ratio between the `` shoving '' work and the `` inner '' contribution is @xmath16=|d\\ln f / d\\ln\\delta r|/2 \\gg 1 $ ] .",
    "it is the high - frequency _ shear _ elastic constant that enters into the shoving model prediction because the expansion of a sphere in an elastic solid results in a radial displacement in the surroundings , which varies with distance @xmath17 to the sphere center as @xmath18.@xcite this is a pure shear deformation , i.e. , with zero divergence and thus no density changes anywhere ( compare to the coulomb electric field of a point charge @xmath19 , which also has zero divergence ) .",
    "less idealized geometries would result in some density change and thus also involve the bulk modulus , but it has been shown generally that the bulk elastic energy of the far field of an elastic dipole constitutes a most 10% of the total elastic energy.@xcite this confirms the interesting phenomenon of `` shear dominance '' noted some time ago in various contexts of condensed matter physics and materials science ( see refs . and and their references ) .",
    "the idealized instantaneous affine shear modulus refers to the hypothetical situation where one imposes an instantaneous , perfectly affine shear deformation on the system , corresponding to a time scale so fast that the atoms do not move , i.e. , on a femtosecond time scale .",
    "this quantity is not experimentally accessible for the following reasons .",
    "it is difficult to imagine imposing an affine shear deformation on a system on a femtosecond time scale .",
    "even if this were possible , one would not observe a high - frequency limiting shear modulus above thz frequencies  inertial effects would set in and cause the modulus to go to zero as frequency diverges without limit . on the other hand , in a computer simulation an instantaneous affine shear deformation is easily imposed on a system .",
    "the energy barrier is calculated as the work done in shoving aside the surroundings . according to a fundamental theorem of statistical mechanics , the difference in free energy between two states",
    "can be calculated as the reversible isothermal work done to bring the system from one to the other state .",
    "thus , in calculating the energy barrier , the expansion of the sphere must take place so slowly that there is equilibrium in the surroundings throughout the expansion process .",
    "on the other hand , since the activation ( free ) energy refers to the thermally activated creation of extra volume in the fixed , glassy structure of the surrounding molecules , the expansion must be fast enough that no relaxations take place in the surrounding liquid .",
    "this means that the time of expansion must be much smaller than the alpha relaxation time . in conclusion ,",
    "the relevant elastic constants of elastic models refer to high frequencies , still much below phonon frequencies . in this frequency range",
    "the bulk and shear elastic constants are usually frequency independent for highly viscous liquids ( ignoring possible secondary relaxations ) .    over the years",
    "we have occasionally met the misunderstanding that the `` shoving '' process is the work done during the actual barrier transition of the rearranging molecules , which takes place over a few picoseconds .",
    "this is not correct ; the ( free ) energy barrier is a difference in free energy between two states  the starting state and the transition state  and as detailed above this quantity is calculated by reference to statistical mechanics and the reversible - work theorem .",
    "both the experimentally measurable high - frequency plateau shear modulus  referring to frequencies much below phonon frequencies  and the experimentally non - accessible truly instantaneous affine shear modulus have traditionally been denoted by @xmath0 .",
    "this would not present a serious problem if the two moduli were more or less identical or , from the shoving model perspective , if they were proportional in their temperature variation throughout the phase diagram .",
    "it now appears that neither is the case.@xcite this calls for introducing an unambiguous notation .",
    "we suggest denoting the experimental `` instantaneous '' shear modulus by @xmath20 ( p for plateau ) and the idealized , affine truly instantaneous shear modulus by @xmath21 ( `` af '' for affine ) . in this notation , which need only to be used whenever there is a risk of confusion , the shoving model prediction is    @xmath22\\,.\\ ] ]    before proceeding we note the fluctuation - dissipation ( fd ) theorem expressions for the two instantaneous shear moduli . recall that if one defines @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the x component of the position vector of particle @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the y component on the force on this particle , the fd theorem expression for the frequency - dependent shear viscosity @xmath27 is ( where @xmath28 is the system volume )    @xmath29    since the frequency - dependent shear modulus is related to the viscosity by @xmath30 , letting frequency go to infinity in eq .",
    "( [ fd ] ) gives the well - known expression for the idealized affine infinite - frequency shear modulus @xmath21,@xcite    @xmath31    as mentioned , this quantity can not be measured in experiment . the quantity that can be measured , the plateau modulus @xmath20 , is given by the analogous expression where",
    "@xmath32 is averaged over a few molecular vibration periods ( i.e. , over some picoseconds ) :    @xmath33    we finally note that @xmath34 and @xmath35 are both isomorph invariants . the invariance of the first expression was shown in ref .",
    ", that of the latter follows by analogous arguments .",
    "this shows that the shoving model survives the `` isomorph filter '' according to which any generally applicable model for the non - arrhenius temperature dependence of a supercooled liquid s relaxation time must give this as a function of an isomorph invariant.@xcite",
    "( half - full symbols , right axis ) .",
    "these data are used below for testing the different versions of the shoving model.[fig1 ] ]    the energy - landscape justification of the shoving model@xcite is based on a classical argument , which estimates the barrier height for a jump between two ( free ) energy minima from the curvature at the minima , leading to @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the vibrational mean - square displacement.@xcite if the high - frequency shear and bulk plateau moduli , @xmath20 and @xmath38 , differ from the ideal , affine moduli @xmath21 and @xmath39 , the former are the relevant ones for the phonon spectra .",
    "in fact , one way to probe plateau moduli is to measure the linear ( i.e. , low - wavevector ) parts of the phonon spectra or , equivalently , the shear and longitudinal high - frequency sound velocities .",
    "this is also how ribero _",
    "probed @xmath0 in computer simulations.@xcite in this section term `` instantaneous '' moduli implies the plateau moduli .    in a simple , isotropic elastic model",
    "the vibrational mean - square displacement may be estimated from the instantaneous moduli by using the fact that for a given wavevector , there are two transverse and one longitudinal phonon . if @xmath40 is the longitudinal modulus , this leads@xcite to @xmath41 .",
    "for the temperature dependence of the relaxation time this implies via @xmath36    @xmath42\\,,\\ ] ]    where @xmath43 is a molecular - sized volume . as shown in ref .",
    ", this expression implies shear dominance for the temperature dependence of @xmath3 .",
    "this was shown by first defining for any quantity @xmath44 that increases as @xmath8 decreases its temperature index as @xmath45 .",
    "equation ( [ elp ] ) implies that the temperature index of @xmath3 s activation energy can be written @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is obeyed no matter what is the ratio @xmath48.@xcite in other words , at least 92% of the non - arrhenius temperature dependence of the relaxation time derives from @xmath20 s temperature dependence .",
    "the instantaneous bulk modulus @xmath38 plays only a minor role for three reasons :    * two phonons are transversal for each one that is longitudinal . *",
    "the instantaneous shear modulus @xmath20 affects also the longitudinal phonons . *",
    "longitudinal phonons are harder than transverse and therefore contribute less than one third to the vibrational mean - square displacement .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ elp ] ) that the temperature - dependent activation ( free ) energy @xmath49 is given by    @xmath50    traditionally the shoving model is compared to experiment by plotting the logarithm of the relaxation time ( or , equivalently , the viscosity ) as a function of @xmath51.@xcite such a plot checks whether the predicted linear relationship between @xmath52 and @xmath51 is observed with a physically reasonable prefactor . a convenient way of making this plot is via a generalized angell plot in which the x coordinate is normalized to unity at the glass transition by defining @xmath53/[{g_{\\infty,{\\rm p}}}(t_g)t]$ ] .",
    "unfortunately , measuring the high - frequency plateau shear modulus of the equilibrium metastable supercooled liquid is difficult and not too many data are available even today .",
    "an alternative way of testing the shoving model is by making use of the facts that 1 ) for a fixed cooling rate the relaxation time has a certain value at @xmath1 , 2 ) the ( dc ) shear modulus of the glass , @xmath54 , is almost temperature independent and equal to the instantaneous shear modulus of the liquid at @xmath1 : @xmath55 .",
    "the glass shear modulus is easy to measure , and the prediction of the model is that @xmath56 , in which it is reasonable to assume that the constant is more or the same for similar systems . for the range of metallic glasses compared below to model predictions",
    "we further assume that the characteristic volume @xmath6 is proportional to the molar volume @xmath57 with a universal proportionality constant .",
    "the point of these simplifying assumptions is to eliminate all non - trivial free parameters .",
    "figure 1 gives bulk and shear modulus data for a range of metallic glasses , as well as their glass transition temperatures ranging from 317k for some of the ca - based glasses to 930k for some fe - based ones .",
    "most of these data were discussed and compared to elastic model predictions in refs . , but the cupper - based glasses were replaced .    figure 2 compares data to different versions of the shoving model [ eq .",
    "( [ shov ] ) ] .",
    "since the glass transition takes place when the relaxation time upon cooling reaches a certain value , the standard shoving model prediction is    @xmath58    with a universal proportionality constant .",
    "figure 2(a ) tests this prediction based on the data of fig .",
    "1 , where the metallic glasses are sorted according to their poisson ratio ( @xmath59 is the gas constant ) . given the diversity of the glasses , the model s simplicity , and the simplifying assumption that @xmath60 with a universal proportionality constant , the data show good agreement with the shoving model .",
    "there is , as noted in refs . and , some correlation with poisson s ratio.@xcite before addressing whether the energy - landscape version of the shoving model rectifies this",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "2(b ) how data compares to the elastic model in which @xmath54 is replaced by @xmath61 . here",
    "the correlation with poisson s ratio is much stronger .",
    "altogether , figs .",
    "2(a ) and 2(b ) show that if an elastic model is to work for metallic glasses with a universal value of the characteristic volume @xmath6 in terms of the molar volume @xmath57 , the bulk modulus can play only a minor role .",
    "this constitutes an experimental demonstration of `` shear dominance '' .",
    "for the energy - landscape version of the shoving model eq .",
    "( [ de ] ) translates into the prediction    @xmath62    this is compared to experiment in fig .",
    "the fit is good and there is no correlation to the poisson ratio .",
    "the three `` zero - parameter '' elastic models of fig . 2 have standard deviations , respectively , of 8% for the standard shoving model [ fig .",
    "2(a ) ] , 22% for the bulk modulus elastic model [ fig .",
    "2(b ) ] , and 8% for the energy - landscape version of the shoving model [ fig .",
    "the latter gives no better fit to the data than the original shoving model ( the standard deviation of it is 0.6% lower , but this is hardly significant ) , but has the advantage of eliminating the correlation to the poisson ratio .",
    "a pragmatic one - parameter version of the elastic models is to allow for an arbitrary combination of @xmath54 and @xmath61 by assuming that @xmath1 is controlled by @xmath63 . due to",
    "shear dominance one expects @xmath64 to be close to unity .",
    "indeed , ref . showed that for @xmath65 a very good fit to data is obtained for metallic glasses , a fit which like the energy - landscape shoving model eliminates the correlation to the poisson ratio .",
