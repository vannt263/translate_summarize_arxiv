    "lorentz gases are models that consist of particles moving in space and colliding elastically with spherical obstacles placed on the vertices of a grid , which can be periodic ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) or aperiodic ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a similar model is the ehrenfest wind  tree model , in which the obstacles are diamonds @xcite .",
    "a version of the ehrenfest model is to consider particles moving along the edges of a lattice , placing obstacles at the vertices that deflect particles according to a deterministic rule ; such models are known as lattice lorentz gases .",
    "interest has focused on their diffusive properties @xcite , the distribution of orbit sizes @xcite , topological dynamics @xcite and recurrence properties @xcite .",
    "one of the most - studied versions of the lattice lorentz gas is the lorentz mirror model @xcite , introduced in the physics literature by ruijgrok and cohen  @xcite , where the scatterers are two - sided mirrors placed on the sites of a square lattice , @xmath1 .",
    "these mirrors are fixed , with an orientation of @xmath2 degrees ( right ) or @xmath3 degrees ( left ) , and reflect particles ( or light beams ) that move along the edges of the lattice .",
    "the orientation of each mirror is chosen uniformly at random , with probabilities @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively , with @xmath6 ; the mirror model is thus one of the simplest realisations of deterministic dynamics in a quenched random environment .",
    "( there is also a flipping version of the mirror model , in which the mirrors change orientation when hit @xcite . ) when a particle arrives at a site occupied by a mirror , it is reflected , and leaves along one of the other three edges incident on that site , following the rule given by the mirror ( or absence of a mirror ) there .",
    "thus , either exactly two distinct paths touch a given mirror , or a single path touches the mirror from all directions .    for this model , it was proved that if the total density of mirrors @xmath7 is @xmath8 , and both individual orientation probabilities are greater than @xmath0 , then with probability @xmath8 ( with respect to the random environment ) all trajectories are periodic , forming a closed path , @xcite .    for concentrations @xmath9 , it was conjectured @xcite , based , in part , on numerical simulations @xcite , that the same holds for any mirror concentration @xmath10 .",
    "however , we are not aware of any previous argument , even of a heuristic nature , to confirm or refute this conjecture . of the few rigorous results known for @xmath11",
    ", quas proved that if there exist open orbits , then one of the following holds : there is only one open orbit , or there are infinitely many open orbits @xcite .",
    "recently , kozma and sidoravicius gave a rigorous lower bound on the probability that a trajectory from the origin leaves a square box of given side length @xmath12 .",
    "in this letter we show , incorporating numerical results in our argument , that a weaker result holds : for any mirror density @xmath13 , the _ density _ of open paths ( i.e. , the fraction of edges which are contained in open paths ) converges to @xmath0 in the limit @xmath14 .",
    "we will work exclusively with _",
    "finite _ portions of the infinite lattice , consisting of square boxes with side length @xmath12 : mirrors are placed on the @xmath15 vertices , and there are @xmath16 edges ( excluding those that leave the box ) . the trajectory of a particle forms a _ path _ , i.e. , the directed sequence of edges followed by the particle under the dynamics . in this finite version of the model , some trajectories form _ closed paths _ ( periodic orbits ) , as in the infinite version ; others escape from the finite box , and we call these _ open paths_. note that open paths necessarily are open on both ends , crossing from one edge of the box to another ( possibly the same edge )",
    ". there are thus exactly @xmath17 open paths .",
    "the main quantities of interest in our analysis are the total lengths of all closed and open paths in the system of size @xmath12 , i.e. , the total number of _ edges _ contained in all closed paths and all open paths , respectively ; we denote their means ( over all realisations of the disorder in a box of size @xmath12 ) , as functions of the mirror density @xmath18 , by @xmath19 and @xmath20 . for brevity , we denote @xmath21 , and we similarly omit the argument for other quantities which depend on the mirror density @xmath18 when @xmath22 . since all edges belong either to an open path , or to a closed path , we have @xmath23 for all @xmath10 .    the theorem of grimmett and bunimovich and troubetzkoy on the infinite model states that in the limit @xmath14 , with probability @xmath8 ( with respect to the probability distribution [ product measure ] of the disorder ) , all trajectories close @xcite .",
    "this implies the weaker statement that @xmath24 as @xmath14 , and hence @xmath25 .",
    "our claim is that these also hold when @xmath26 , i.e. that @xmath27 , for any @xmath28 , when @xmath14 .",
    "this implies that no phase transition occurs  this would correspond to the existence of a critical probability @xmath29 such that a positive fraction of paths are open below @xmath29 .",
    "our analysis uses the asymptotic behaviour of the density of open paths as @xmath14 in a fundamental way .",
    "figure  [ fig : open_length ] shows results of numerical simulations of this quantity .",
    "( details of the efficient algorithms employed will be reported in a separate publication . )",
    "we find that the asymptotic behaviour is @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a constant .",
    "we find that @xmath32 ; this exponent seems to be equal to the fractal dimension @xmath33 of the trajectories @xcite .",
    "to explain this , consider those open paths that traverse the box from one side of the system to the other .",
    "these belong to a percolating cluster , and are fractal with exponent @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "many of the open paths will be short , of length of order @xmath12 , being localised close to the boundaries of the square box , and thus will be dominated by the long paths that cross the system .",
    "this implies that @xmath35 will scale as @xmath36 ; dividing by @xmath15 gives the exponent @xmath37 .     of open paths as a function of box size @xmath12 .",
    "the entire box of side length @xmath12 was simulated and each relevant quantity determined ; each data point is averaged over at least 10 runs .",
    "the lines joining the points are a guide for the eye , and the dashed line shows a power - law fit to the second half of the data points . ]    we denote by @xmath38 the probability that a given _ edge _ belongs to a closed path , and @xmath39 the probability that an edge belongs to an open path , both for mirror density @xmath40 .",
    "we also denote by @xmath41 the probability that a randomly - chosen _ vertex _ separates two open paths ( or a single open path with itself ) , and similarly for the other combinations of open and closed .    counting the number of open edges ( those which form part of an open path ) incident on each type of vertex",
    "gives the equality @xmath42    we will study the asymptotic behaviour of the above quantities as @xmath14 , for which we will use the notation @xmath43 to mean that @xmath44 , i.e.  that @xmath45 is asymptotically bounded above by @xmath46 .",
    "our analysis is based on the idea of starting from a configuration with density @xmath40 , in which each lattice site is occupied by a mirror , and removing mirrors to produce a new configuration with density @xmath11 .",
    "we will analyse how the quantities defined above change during this process , and we will obtain an upper bound for the total length of open paths .    consider the removal of a single mirror . in either the finite or infinite version of the model ,",
    "one of the following possibilities occurs : ( i ) two distinct closed paths join together , forming a single closed path with the same total length ; ( ii ) two distinct open paths exchange parts of their paths , maintaining the same total open length ; ( iii ) an open path joins with a closed path , incorporating the closed path into the open path ; ( iv ) the chosen mirror separates two parts of the same path ( either open or closed ) . in case ( iv ) , there are two possibilities : ( a ) the type and length of the path are unaffected , but the order in which edges are visited changes ; or ( b ) the path is divided into a closed path and another path with the same type as the original path before removing the mirror ( closed or open ) .",
    "the possible situations are illustrated in figure  [ fig : example_trajs ] [ cases ( i)(iv)(a ) ] and figure  [ fig : example_trajs2 ] [ case ( iv)(b ) ] .",
    "open paths ( those that leave the box ) are shown in red , and touching closed paths are shown in different colours .",
    "labels indicate the different possible mirror types : ( a ) separating two distinct closed paths ; ( b ) separating an open and a closed path ; ( c ) separating two distinct open paths ; ( d ) embedded in a single closed path ; and ( e ) embedded in a single open path . ]    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     our algorithm proceeds by removing the required fraction of mirrors from the @xmath47 configuration ( all vertices occupied by mirrors ) , in a certain order , in order to produce a configuration with @xmath48 ; any configuration with @xmath11 may be produced in this way .",
    "the algorithm is as follows :    1 .   select , uniformly at random , the sites in the @xmath49 box at which mirrors will be removed , each with probability @xmath50 , independently of the rest ; call this set @xmath51 .",
    "2 .   remove , one by one , those mirrors in @xmath51 that separate two _ distinct _ closed paths .",
    "remove those mirrors in @xmath51 that join a closed path with itself .",
    "4 .   remove the mirrors in @xmath51 that connect an open path with a closed path .",
    "5 .   remove the remaining mirrors in @xmath51 , i.e. , those that connect an open path with itself or with a different open path .    note that since step ( 3 ) does not modify the total length of open paths , while step ( 5 ) can only reduce this length by producing closed paths ( see figure  [ fig : example_trajs2 ] ) , we do not need to take them into account to obtain an upper bound .",
    "first consider step ( 2 ) , in which mirrors that join two distinct closed paths are removed , creating a single closed path . here",
    ", an order must be chosen in which to remove this subset of mirrors .",
    "when each mirror is checked , it is removed only if it _",
    "currently _ separates two _ distinct _ closed paths .",
    "the exact configuration of closed paths obtained at the end of this step thus depends on the order in which these mirrors are removed .",
    "nonetheless , all the different configurations obtained , by removing these mirrors in any order , have the same number of closed paths , which we denote by @xmath52 , the same length @xmath53 ( since the total length of closed paths has not changed in the process ) , and the same number of mirrors removed , which we denote by @xmath54 .",
    "each of the mirrors removed in this step reduces the number of closed paths by @xmath8 .",
    "thus @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the number of closed paths when @xmath22 .",
    "note that @xmath54 is bounded above by @xmath57 .",
    "we will argue that @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is a positive function of @xmath10 and @xmath56 is the number of closed paths when @xmath22 .",
    "consider the closed paths with exactly four edges , which we call `` square paths '' , and in particular those square paths that are not in contact with another square path .",
    "there is a positive probability that a given bond belongs to one of these paths ; call this probability @xmath60 .",
    "since these square paths have four vertices , and none of them belongs to another square path , there are exactly 4 independent mirrors for each of these paths .",
    "thus , the probability that one of the mirrors that belong to a given one of these closed paths is removed is @xmath61 , and hence , the number of these closed paths after step ( 2 ) is bounded below by @xmath62 , so that @xmath63 . since @xmath64 ( as measured numerically ) , for any @xmath13 we have @xmath65 with @xmath66 .      in step ( 4 ) , we remove those mirrors that connect an open path with a closed path . in this case , the closed path is amalgamated into the open path , so that the total open length grows by the length of this closed path .",
    "to estimate this increase , we use that the expected increase in the total open length is the _",
    "mean _ length of those closed paths that touch at least one open path ; this mean length we denote by @xmath67 . to use this",
    ", we relate it to the mean length of _ all _ closed paths , @xmath68 $ ] .",
    "( note that the closed paths referred to are those _",
    "after _ the removal step ( 2 ) . ) figure  [ fig : types_of_closed_path ] shows that for @xmath47 , we have @xmath69 and a constant @xmath70 .",
    "( the efficient algorithm used for this calculation will be described in a separate publication . )     of mean closed path length to mean length of those closed paths that touch open ones ( double logarithmic scale ) .",
    "each data point is averaged over at least 10 runs . ]",
    "it is an open question whether this exponent @xmath71 is related with known quantities in percolation , as occurs with the exponent @xmath72 .",
    "one possibility is the fractal dimension of the 2d percolation cluster , @xmath73 @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : ell - cl ] we plot separately @xmath74 and @xmath67 as functions of @xmath12 .",
    "although neither of these two quantities appears to follow a power law , their ratio does . for sufficiently large values of @xmath12",
    ", we have that @xmath75 may be estimated as @xmath76 , with @xmath77 .",
    "this result is obtained by using that @xmath78 ( see figure [ fig : open_length ] ) , the definition @xmath79 for @xmath47 , and the fact that @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is a constant .    , and mean length of closed paths that touch open ones , @xmath67 as a function of @xmath12 ( double logarithmic scale ) . ]    for other values of @xmath10 , we will assume that @xmath82 .",
    "we wish to show that @xmath83 for all @xmath28 .",

    ", we obtain @xmath88 \\ , \\frac{{n_{\\mathrm{co},l}}({p})}{n_l({p } ) }   \\sim l^{-\\beta({p})}.\\ ] ]    suppose that the worst case occurs : @xmath89 , so that @xmath90 .",
    "using similar arguments to those used above to show @xmath91 , we have @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is a positive function of @xmath10 .",
    "thus , @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is again a positive function of @xmath10 .",
    "thus , @xmath96 .",
    "the mean number of mirrors removed that join an open and a closed path is bounded above by @xmath97 .",
    "( note that some mirrors join closed paths with themselves . )",
    "thus we have @xmath98 ( here we have assumed that each joined closed path may be treated independently of the others , so that the total length increase is just given by the mean length increase times the number of such closed paths . )    dividing equation   by @xmath99 and using @xmath100 , we have @xmath101 now , using @xmath102 and @xmath103 and the bound @xmath104 , we obtain @xmath105    now , since @xmath106 , we have @xmath107 since @xmath108 and @xmath24 . thus , equation   gives @xmath109 recalling that @xmath110 , we finally have @xmath111 and hence @xmath112    since our numerical results show that @xmath113 , we conclude that @xmath114 , that is , the density of open paths tends to @xmath0 , or equivalently the density of closed paths tends to @xmath8 , as the box size goes to infinity , for _ any _ mirror density @xmath18 .",
    "in this paper , we have shown , using input from numerical calculations , that in the limit of infinite system size the density of open paths in the lorentz mirror model tends to @xmath0 for any mirror probability @xmath28 .",
    "this is a weaker form of the conjecture that with probability @xmath8 all trajectories close .",
    "our argument reduces the problem to the analysis of the two exponents @xmath72 and @xmath71 , which we calculated numerically via efficient simulations .",
