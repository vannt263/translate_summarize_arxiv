    "in the past few years the lattice simulation of qcd flux - tubes has reached a level of precision where they can be unambiguously compared with the expectations from various effective string descriptions ( two of the most recent investigations are @xcite , and a lucid review with a history of numerical simulations of flux - tube using lattice gauge theory is given in @xcite . )",
    "these results show that the ground state energy of a long flux - tube matches very well with that obtained by arvis @xcite for the nambu - goto string in four flat dimensions .",
    "it was also pointed out in @xcite , that there are few excited states of a closed flux - tube that do show a large deviation from the nambu - goto prediction .",
    "excited states of open flux - tube have only been calculated in three dimensions @xcite and do not show any unambiguous deviations from the predictions of the nambu - goto string , within the accuracy of the simulations .",
    "the effective string theory description of qcd flux - tubes assumes that the length of the flux - tube , @xmath2 is much greater than any intrinsic thickness , @xmath3 , of the flux - tube .",
    "space - time history of such a flux - tube , in the absence of dynamical quarks , can be approximated by a two - dimensional surface or the world - sheet .",
    "the dynamics of this world - sheet is independent of the two - dimensional coordinate system used to describe it .",
    "a general reparametrization invariant action can be organised into relevant , marginal and irrelevant terms by dimensional analysis .",
    "the relevant term , which is proportional to the area of the world - sheet , is the nambu - goto action .",
    "then there are marginal and irrelevant terms constructed from various powers of intrinsic and extrinsic curvatures ( see for e.g. @xcite ) .    in describing the dynamics of a qcd flux - tube using the nambu - goto action alone we expect two types of corrections : one that comes from the marginal and the irrelevant terms in the effective string action , and the other from the non - stringy degrees of freedom of a qcd flux - tube .",
    "later being encapsulated in the notion of an intrinsic thickness of a flux - tube .",
    "the lattice results indicate that both types of correction to the static potential at sufficiently large distances are small .",
    "the absence of stringy corrections , that is the correction to the nambu - goto action from the marginal and the irrelevant terms , has been greatly elucidated in the recent theoretical investigations @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present investigation is to try and understand the nature of the correction due to the intrinsic thickness of the qcd flux - tube .",
    "the notion of an intrinsic thickness of a flux - tube , though well motivated , is imprecise in qcd as we do not understand their dynamical origin .",
    "it is here that one expects that the conjectured gauge / gravity duality @xcite should allow us to delineate the effects of the intrinsic thickness of the flux - tube . a fundamental feature of the gauge / gravity duality is that the strings dual to the gauge theory live in ( at least ) five - dimensional curved space .",
    "these five - dimensional strings then should provide an _ exact _ description of the four - dimensional qcd flux - tubes .",
    "these fundamental strings have at least one additional degree of freedom as compared to the effective four - dimensional strings .",
    "it is tempting to associate this additional degree of freedom with the intrinsic thickness of a qcd flux - tube .",
    "this can be made more precise in the context of ads / cft correspondence @xcite , by looking at the size of the holographic projection of a five - dimensional object on to the four - dimensions .",
    "ads / cft correspondence @xcite can be regarded as an example of a more general gauge / gravity duality @xcite according to which all gauge theories , including qcd , have a dual description in terms of fundamental strings living in a higher - dimensional curved space - time .",
    "for qcd we do not known the precise geometry in which these putative five - dimensional strings live , but an approximate description which captures some of the properties of the qcd can be obtained by modifications of @xmath4 space .",
    "a particularly simple modification was used in @xcite to understand the form factors of hadrons in terms of the intrinsically thick effective qcd strings arising from the holographic projection of the fundamental five - dimensional strings .",
    "we will use their modification to investigate the correction to the static potential due to the intrinsic thickness of the qcd flux - tube .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "the classical solution of the five dimensional string in the assumed confining geometry is described , and is interpreted as a static flux - tube of finite intrinsic thickness . in the same section the quadratic fluctuations about the classical solution are considered , and the mode corresponding to the fluctuation of the intrinsic thickness is found to be massive .",
    "classical solution of a string in confining geometries and their quantum fluctuations have of course been studied since the very inception of the ads / cft conjecture ( an incomplete list of references is @xcite ) , our emphasize in this section is to relate the intrinsic thickness of the qcd flux - tube to the position of the string along the fifth direction . in sec .",
    "we calculate the heavy quark potential in the large @xmath1 approximation @xcite , where @xmath1 is the number of transverse directions in the flat space where qcd is defined .",
    "the resulting potential is given by arvis s formula @xcite for the nambu - goto string corrected by a term which is exponentially suppressed by the factor of @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a measure of the intrinsic thickness of the qcd flux - tube .",
    "this result is compared with the static potential obtained from an effective string action which has , in addition to the nambu - goto term , a marginal term , the so called rigidity term .",
    "we abstract a picture of qcd effective strings suggested by our result and state our conclusions in the final section .",
    "one way of stating the conjectured gauge / gravity duality is via the expectation value of a wilson loop .",
    "the expectation value of a wilson loop in a four - dimensional yang - mills gauge theory is formally given by@xmath7 & = & \\mathrm{tr}\\hat{p}\\exp\\left\\ { i\\oint_{\\gamma}a\\right\\ } , \\nonumber \\\\",

    "the gauge / gravity duality then implies that this expectation value is also given by a weighted sum over all the surfaces whose boundary is the curve @xmath8 which lives in the flat four - dimensional space , while the surfaces themselves live in a curved five - dimensional space . symbolically@xmath13>_{ym}=\\int[dx]\\exp\\left\\ { -t_{o}\\int d^{2}\\sigma\\sqrt{\\gamma[x]}\\right\\ } , \\label{eq : gauge / gravity}\\ ] ] where@xmath14 is the string surface parametrized by the parameters @xmath15",
    ", @xmath16 is the determinant of the induced metric@xmath17 and @xmath18 is the string - tension .",
    "the curved five - dimensional space is described by the metric @xmath19 , which following @xcite will be taken to be of the following form    @xmath20    where the function @xmath21 is assumed to have a minimum at @xmath22 and for @xmath23 it approaches the @xmath4 limit @xmath24@xmath25    consider now a wilson loop made of the world - lines of a quark at the origin and an anti - quark placed along the @xmath26 axis at a coordinate distance of @xmath27 working in the static gauge@xmath28 the classical world - sheet , or the minimal surface , is of the form:@xmath29 @xmath30 , which is a geodesic in the five - dimensional curved space , satisfies the equation@xmath31y^{'}}{\\sqrt{(1+y^{'2})}}\\right)=f^{'}[y]\\sqrt{(1+y^{'})^{2}}.\\label{eq : eom}\\ ] ]    with the assumed form of @xmath32 $ ] , qualitatively @xmath30 looks like the curve shown in fig.([fig:1 ] ) .",

    "this might not be the case as suggested in @xcite .",
    "this shows that precise lattice simulations can inform us about the conjectured fundamental string theory that is dual to qcd .",
    "the gauge / gravity duality offers the possibility of illuminating the success and failures of the nambu - goto string in describing qcd flux - tubes .",
    "this possibility is of course tempered by the fact that we do not know the precise string theory in five dimensions that corresponds to qcd in four dimensions . in the absence of that",
    ", one can explore physically motivated five - dimensional string theories that captures some essential features , like confinement .",
    "the main result of our calculations , , with in the approximations considered , has three salient features .",
    "firstly , as far as the contribution to the static potential is concerned , the massless modes corresponding to the transverse fluctuations in four dimension , decouple from the massive mode arising from the fluctuation in the fifth dimension .",
    "secondly , the contribution of the massless modes to the static potential is identical to that for the nambu - goto string in four - dimensions .",
    "finally , the contribution of the massive mode , which corresponds to the fluctuations in the intrinsic thickness , are exponentially suppressed and are non - analytic in the intrinsic thickness of the flux - tube . in obtaining",
    "we neglected the contribution from the fluctuation of the string in the region adjacent to the boundary , characterized by length @xmath35 in fig .",
    ", concentrating on the flux - tubes for which @xmath103 the physics in these regions is governed by the detailed form of @xmath21 in . since the @xmath45 coordinate of the string changes rapidly near the boundary , one would expect that effects of intrinsic thickness should be important , and they could couple with the massless modes",
    ". a possible hint of this is seen in the interaction of the spin of the quark and the anti - quark with the fluctuations of the flux - tube connecting them @xcite .",
    "perhaps most importantly it is for @xmath104 that a realistic dual string description should reproduce the effects of asymptotic freedom , and the static potential obtained through gauge / gravity duality should match the perturbatively results .",
    "our analysis suggests that long , @xmath105 , open flux - tubes connecting quark with an anti - quark , are described just by the nambu - goto action with no contribution from a marginal rigidity term or any finite number of irrelevant terms",
    ". therefore it will be very useful to have numerical results for the excited states of open flux - tube , and to see how well they match with the prediction of the nambu - goto string ( excited states of open string in three dimension have been explored in @xcite . ) if the suggested picture is correct then , for @xmath105 , the only deviation from the nambu - goto string should come from the excitations of the massive modes related to the intrinsic thickness , and from their possible coupling with the massless modes .",
    "for closed flux - tube it has been pointed out in @xcite that there are definite deviations from the nambu - goto string for the excited states , which may be a hint of the non - stringy modes related to the intrinsic thickness @xcite .    in our analysis",
    ", the origin of the nambu - goto term in the effective four dimensional string theory can be traced to our assumption that the fundamental string in five - dimension is described by the nambu - goto action alone , and to the specific curved geometry used to describe the confinement . in particular , the assumed form of the warp factor in the fifth dimension was responsible for making the mode associated with the fluctuation of the intrinsic thickness of the qcd flux - tube massive . a different kind of confining background could in principle induce an effective string description in four dimension which has in addition to nambu - goto term a marginal rigidity term and possibly irrelevant terms @xcite .",
    "this shows , as we remarked at the end of sec .",
    ", that precise lattice measurement of static potential can provide us with a unique window into the geometry of the conjectured five - dimensional strings which are dual to qcd .",
    "a fundamental bosonic string in five dimension by itself is probably not a consistent quantum mechanical system and a consistent description would correspondingly require additional bosonic and fermionic variables .",
    "further , the background geometry in which these fundamental strings live should reproduce not only confinement but also the asymptotic freedom of qcd",
    ". therefore our use of the gauge / gravity duality is at best an approximation .",
    "the success of the four - dimensional nambu - goto string in describing qcd flux - tube indicates that this approximation does capture some of the long distance physics of qcd .",
    "one of the attractive feature of our use of gauge / gravity duality is that it associates the extra degree of freedom of a five dimensional string with the intrinsic thickness of the qcd flux - tube",
    ". it will be very interesting to see if one can similarly relate the extra bosonic and fermionic modes required by a fundamental superstring with some degrees of freedom of qcd flux - tube .",
