    ", the extended hvc complexes would be the nearby objects currently undergoing accretion onto the galaxy , while the more compact , isolated ones would be their distant counterparts in the local group environment .",
    "it is striking that the population of anomalous velocity splits naturally into two rather distinct components when observed with the spatial sampling and sensitivity of modern surveys , like the leiden / dwingeloo survey ( lds : hartmann & burton @xcite ) in the north and the parkes multibeam survey ( see putman & gibson @xcite ) in the south . with this new perspective",
    ", it has become clear that the large majority of the 561 objects previously cataloged as distinct hvcs by wakker and van woerden ( @xcite ) are the local , low ",
    "contrast maxima of extended diffuse complexes with angular sizes of tens of degrees .",
    "in addition to this diffuse , yet lumpy , component there appear to be several hundred intrinsically compact objects with angular sizes of about 1 degree .",
    "objects of intermediate angular size appear to be rather rare .",
    "braun and burton ( @xcite ) identified and confirmed 65 examples of compact , isolated high  velocity clouds ( the chvcs ) which plausibly represent a homogeneous subsample of the high  velocity clouds , in a single physical state , and arguably before their physical properties have been strongly influenced by the radiation field of the milky way or of m31 , or by a gravitational encounter with one of these major systems .",
    "braun and burton showed , in particular , that the velocity dispersion of the chvc sample is minimized in a reference frame consistent within the observational errors to the local group standard of rest .",
    "this minimization provides a quantitative demonstration of local  group deployment . within this frame ,",
    "the chvc ensemble is dynamically quite cold , with a dispersion of only 70  km  s@xmath0 , although strongly infalling into the local group barycenter at a velocity of about 100  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "most hvcs have been identified simply by their anomalous ",
    "velocity emission in total",
    " power surveys at an angular resolution of 05 or coarser .",
    "information on characteristic intrinsic linear scales , on resolved spectral properties which might reveal , for example , opacity information , and on such kinematic properties as intrinsic widths or possible rotation , have been largely unavailable . of the sample of 65 compact , isolated hvcs catalogued by braun and burton ( @xcite ) ,",
    "only two had been subject to interferometric imaging .",
    "wakker and schwarz ( @xcite ) used the westerbork array to show that both chvc114@xmath410@xmath4430 and chvc111@xmath406@xmath4466 are characterized by a core / halo morphology , with only about 40% of the single  dish flux recovered on angular scales of tens of arcmin , and , furthermore , that the linewidths of the single  dish spectra of these two sources were resolved into components of some 5 width or less . both of the imaged systems display systematic velocity gradients along the major axis of an elliptical distribution , which wakker and schwarz judged to be suggestive of rotation in self  gravitating systems at local group distances .",
    "if the chvc objects are in fact a population of unevolved sub - dwarf galaxies scattered throughout the local group , then they might reveal some morphological characteristics which would not be consistent with the expectations of other suggested scenarios , in particular for objects ejected by a galactic fountain ( e.g. shapiro and field @xcite , bregman @xcite ) or located within the galactic halo ( moore et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    the westerbork imaging discussed in this paper reveals a characteristic core / halo morphology for the chvcs , very narrow linewidths in the cores , and , in many cases , a signature of rotation .",
    "these properties are strongly suggestive of self - gravitating systems at local group distances , and specifically resemble the gaseous components of some dwarf galaxies . on the contrary , if the chvc objects were produced relatively locally by an energetic mechanism responsible for a galactic fountain , then their properties might have been expected to include large linewidths , motions not ordered by rotation , and a characteristic morphology other than that of a core / halo .",
    "high  resolution imaging also makes it possible to provide specific targets for optical observations .",
    "deep optical imaging would help clarify the distinction between the chvcs and ( sub)dwarf galaxies , and any indication of a stellar population would allow a direct distance determination .",
    "if the chvcs are at local group distances , then the diffuse h@xmath5 emission surrounding them is expected to be weaker than that associated with high  velocity gas in complexes lying within the halo of the milky way or extending from the magellanic clouds ( bland - hawthorn & maloney @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , high  resolution imaging is necessary in order to interpret existing observations aimed at detecting an hvc in absorption against a star in the halo of the milky way or against an extragalactic background source of continuum radiation . in either case",
    ", the absorption experiment targets an extremely small area .",
    "it is not clear if the failure to detect absorption in at least some of the published accounts should be attributed to the hvc in question not in fact covering the continuum source , rather than to the metallicity characterisics of the hvc ( for the cases of a negative result toward an extragalactic background sources ) or to the hvc being at a larger distance ( for the cases of a negative result toward halo stars ) .",
    "the results shown below indicate that only a small portion of each object is characterized by the high column density emission from the chvc cores , and thus that selection of suitable probes for absorption  line measurements must take the actual column density distribution into account .",
    "if the compact hvcs discussed here are distributed throughout the local group as primordial objects , either surviving as remnants of the formation of the local group galaxies , or still raining in to these systems in a continuing evolution , then such objects would also be expected near other groups of galaxies .",
    "several searches for such objects beyond the local group are currently in progress .",
    "the results presented here on the small angular sizes of the chvcs generally and the even smaller surface covering factor of the high column density cores must be considered when designing an optimum search strategy or when calculating the expected detection statistics for a given experiment directed at other galaxies or groups of galaxies .",
    "a conclusive detection experiment of this type has not yet been carried out .",
    "our discussion is organized as follows .",
    "we begin by describing the method of sample selection in  [ sec : samp ] , proceed with a description of the newly acquired observations in  [ sec : data ] and continue with a presentation and discussion of our results in   [ sec : results ] and [ sec : disc ] .",
    "we close by briefly summarizing our results in  [ sec : summ ] .",
    "because high  resolution imaging had previously only been obtained for two objects of the chvc class , we chose a sample from the catalog of braun and burton ( @xcite ) which spanned a wide range of the source properties , paying particular attention to source position both on the sky and in radial velocity , as well as to the physical attributes of linewidth and total flux density .",
    "although only six chvc sources were imaged in our program , the sources are distributed widely in galactic coordinates , span radial velocities of @xmath6 , vary in linewidth from 6 to 95 , and in line flux from 25 to 300 jy .",

    "the interim wsrt correlator system available at the time was used to provide 256 uniformly weighted spectral channels in two linear polarizations across 2.5  mhz centered on the @xmath10 velocity of each source .",
    "the effective velocity resolution was 1.2 times the channel spacing of 2.06  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "standard gain and bandpass calibrations were carried out after editing the data and deleting all baselines effected by shadowing . a component model for the continuum emission from each field was derived from an image made from the average of the line  free spectral channels .",
    "this model was subtracted directly from the visibility data .",
    "the block of spectral channels containing line emission was imaged with a visibility  based clean deconvolution proceeding down to a flux level of twice the rms noise level at a variety of spatial resolutions .",
    "uniform weighting of the visibility data was employed , together with a series of gaussian tapers decreasing to 30% amplitude at projected baselines of 1.25 , 2.5 , 5 , and 10 k@xmath11 , resulting in spatial resolutions of about 120 , 60 , 30 , and 20  arcsec , respectively . in a few cases ,",
    "some residual continuum emission was still present in the data cubes ; in those cases , several spectral channels from both edges of the cube were averaged together and subtracted from the entire cube .",
    "the typical rms noise levels in the deconvolved cubes were 2.0 , 1.7 , 1.4 , and 1.3 mjy per beam per spectral channel at the four spatial resolutions noted above .",
    "the corresponding brightness sensitivities were , respectively , 0.085 , 0.29 , 0.95 , and 2.0  k in a single channel of 2.06  km  s@xmath0 width .",
    "( flux per beam and brightness temperature are related as usual by @xmath12 , or @xmath13 for @xmath14 , the beam area in arcsec@xmath15 . )",
    "expressed as an optically thin column density , the sensitivities correspond to 0.32 , 1.1 , 3.6 , and 7.4  @xmath16  @xmath17 , respectively , for emission filling the beam and extending over a single velocity channel . while some emission profiles originating in the cool atomic phase are indeed as narrow as the single  channel velocity width ( as we will see below ) , emission profiles originating in the warm neutral phase will have substantially broader linewidths .",
    "for example , the thermal linewidth of a component with kinetic temperature , @xmath18  k , will be 21  km  s@xmath0 fwhm . at this velocity resolution ,",
    "our column density sensitivity is degraded to 1.0 , 3.5 , 11 , and 24  @xmath19  @xmath17 .",
    "this somewhat counter  intuitive correspondence of column density sensitivity with the expected linewidth must be borne in mind .",
    "narrow lines are significantly easier to detect than broad ones .",
    "moment images ( zero , first , and second ) were generated from each cube after employing a blanking criterion for inclusion of each pixel in the weighted sum .",
    "this involved demanding a brightness in excess of about 2@xmath20 after smoothing the cube by a factor of three both spatially and in velocity .",
    "images of integrated emission were corrected for the primary  beam response of the instrument , which is well  approximated ( at 1420 mhz ) by a circular gaussian with 2110  arcsec fwhm .    while structures extending over as much as 10  arcmin in a single spectral channel were adequately recovered in the resulting images ,",
    "there were also indications of the presence of more diffuse features which could not be adequately imaged .",
    "these were apparent due to the artifacts they induced ; specifically , the so  called short  spacing bowl surrounding regions of bright extended emission . even with careful windowing during the deconvolution it was not possible to completely eliminate such artifacts .",

    "dispersion compact cores embedded in a diffuse , warmer halo .",
    "this is consistent with what was seen previously by wakker & schwarz ( @xcite ) for the two chvcs which they imaged .",
    "the compact cores can be unambiguously identified with the cool neutral medium ( cnm ) of condensed atomic hydrogen , since their linewidths are in all cases significantly narrower than even the thermal linewidth of the warm neutral medium ( wnm ) . in one object",
    "we detect some of the narrowest emission lines yet seen , with an intrinsic fwhm of 2  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "the halo linewidths , while difficult to measure directly , appear broad enough to be consistent with a wnm origin .",
    "such a nested geometry of cnm and wnm is in agreement with the expectation from thermodynamics since a significant neutral shielding column is required for the stable existence of cnm when exposed to an ionizing radiation field ( e.g. wolfire et al .",
    "@xcite ) . the flux fraction in compact cores varies between about 1% and 50% in our chvc sub  sample , but is typically 40% , as also seen in the two cases studied by wakker and schwarz ( @xcite ) .",
    "the surface covering factor of the moderate column density core emission relative to the diffuse halo is usually a factor two lower , namely about 15% .",
    "high  resolution imaging of the column density distribution of chvc125 + 41@xmath121 has permitted an improved determination of the metal abundance in this object when combined with a previous measurement of unsaturated absorption ( bowen & blades @xcite , bowen et al .",
    "@xcite ) of between 0.04 and 0.07 solar .",
    "the current program has also allowed meaningful distance estimates for chvcs to be made for the first time .",
    "distances in the range 0.5 to 1 mpc follow from two independent approaches .",
    "the first method utilizes the fact that we have resolved cool , opaque knots of within one of the six imaged systems ( chvc125 + 41@xmath121 ) . by equating the observed angular size of these knots with the line  of  sight depth ,",
    "we derive a distance from a comparison of the column and volume densities .",
    "estimates of the column density follow directly from our data , while specific thermodynamic calculations for volume densities under the relevant physical conditions were made available to us by wolfire , sternberg , hollenbach , and mckee ( private communication ) .",
    "the second approach allows only a combination of source distance and dark matter fraction to be derived , since it relies on a comparison of dynamical with visible mass under the assumption that the system is gravitationally bound . for this approach , the chvc115 + 13@xmath122 system proved particularly illuminating , since a collection of some 10 compact cores is distributed over a 30  arcmin diameter region within a common diffuse envelope , while having discrete line  of  sight velocities distributed over a 70  km  s@xmath0 range . at an assumed distance ,",
    "@xmath2  mpc , the dark  to  visible mass ratio is @xmath123 , with @xmath83 scaling as @xmath3 .",
    "a common feature observed in the chvcs is that the compact cores have an elliptical shape with a clear velocity gradient aligned with the major axis .",
    "these kinematic data can be well  modeled by rotation in flattened disk systems .",
    "rotation curve fits to the best  resolved cores within chvc069 + 04@xmath124 and chvc204 + 30 + 075 , yield rather high dark - to - visible mass ratios of @xmath83 = 1040 at d  =  0.7  mpc , with @xmath83 scaling , as above , with 1/d .",
    "moreover , the shape of the rotation curves in two of these three cases is very well described by that due to a cold dark matter halo as parameterized by navarro et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "well  resolved imaging has also revealed another intriguing aspect of the chvcs .",
    "five instances of localized line splitting are detected .",
    "these are areas of 60 to 90 arcsec extent in regions of moderately high column density in which the emission profile becomes doubly peaked in velocity , without displaying a shift in the velocity centroid .",
    "this appears to be a signature of localized outflow or inflow . at a distance of 0.7",
    "mpc they would correspond to feaures of a few hundred pc in extent , comparable in size to the stellar  wind  driven bubbles surrounding young stellar associations .",
    "comparison of the chvc properties with those of nearby low mass galaxies shows striking similarities , particularly with the local group dwarf irregulars .",
    "the required thermal pressure for condensation of the cool cnm cores , @xmath104/k  @xmath125  100  @xmath58  k , can be achieved in hydrostatic equilibrium of a self  gravitating disk  like distribution at the observed shielding column of wnm of about 10@xmath119  @xmath17 if the significant mass density of the dark matter halos is taken into account within the inner 2  kpc .",
    "our study of the compact high  velocity  clouds has helped to clarify the nature of these objects .",
    "all of the evidence points to these being strongly dark  matter  dominated , self  gravitating objects of modest mass in the local group potential at distances between perhaps 0.3 and 1 mpc with physical dimensions in of about 10  kpc .",
    "typical masses of a few times 10@xmath99  m@xmath78 are indicated , with associated dark masses of some 10@xmath126  m@xmath78 .",
    "the total number of such objects associated with the local group , while still uncertain , may be about 200 .",
    "it seems likely that these are the objects which recent numerical simulations suggest should still be associated with massive galaxies in a poor environment at the current epoch ( klypin et al .",
    "@xcite , moore et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the star formation history within these objects is still very much a mystery .",
    "high stellar densities , like those seen in dwarf spheroidal systems in the local group , are clearly not associated with the centroids of the gas distribution . a large spatial separation of the gas and associated stellar distribution , due for example to tidal effects ,",
    "is not expected to be a common circumstance since the population is dynamically so cold .",
    "the peak column densities currently observed within the chvc cores only rarely exceed 10@xmath28 @xmath17 .",
    "it is plausible that these values are insufficient to allow widespread star formation at this time . on the other hand ,",
    "finite yet low metallicities have been measured in at least one source , indicating that some enrichment has clearly taken place in the past .",
    "it is quite possible that associated old stellar populations with a low surface density will be found in deep searches which can distinguish such stars from the galactic foreground .",

    "<S> six examples of the compact , isolated high  velocity clouds ( chvcs ) identified by braun and burton ( @xcite ) , but only marginally resolved in single  dish data , have been imaged with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope . the 65 confirmed objects in this class define a dynamically cold system , with a global minimum for the velocity dispersion of only 70 km  s@xmath0 , found in the local group standard of rest . </S>",
    "<S> the population is in - falling at 100 km  s@xmath0 toward the local group barycenter . </S>",
    "<S> these objects have a characteristic morphology , in which one or more compact cores is embedded in a diffuse halo </S>",
    "<S> . the compact cores typically account for 40% of the line flux while covering some 15% of the source area . </S>",
    "<S> the narrow line width of all core components allows unambiguous identification of these with the cool condensed phase of @xmath1 , the cnm , with kinetic temperature near 100  k , while the halos appear to represent a shielding column of warm diffuse @xmath1 , the wnm , with temperature near 8000  k. we detect a core with one of the narrowest emission lines ever observed , with intrinsic fwhm of no more than 2  km  s@xmath0 and 75  k brightness . from a comparison of column and volume densities for this feature we derive a distance in the range 0.5 to 1 mpc . </S>",

    "<S> two out of three of the derived rotation curves are well - fit by navarro , frenk , and white ( 1997 ) cold dark matter profiles . </S>",
    "<S> these kinematic signatures imply a high dark - to - visible mass ratio of 1050 , for @xmath2  mpc , which scales as @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the implied dark matter halos dominate the mass volume density within the central 2  kpc ( 10  arcmin ) of each source , providing a sufficent hydrostatic pressure to allow cnm condensation . </S>",
    "<S> the chvc properties are similar in many respects to those of the local group dwarf irregular galaxies , excepting the presence of a high surface brightness stellar population . </S>"
