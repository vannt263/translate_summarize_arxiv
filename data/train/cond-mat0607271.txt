    "since the discovery of high - temperature superconductivity in copper - based transition - metal oxides , a tremendous effort has been devoted to establish a convincing theory that covers the general aspects of their unusual and fascinating physics .",
    "the attempts are complicated by the fact that strong electron correlations play a key role in the physics of the cuprates . a central question in this context concerns the emergence of small energy scales , much smaller than the bare ( coulomb ) interactions between the electrons , which govern the existence and the competition of different phases at low temperatures .",
    "this can be studied by considering prototypical lattice models of strongly correlated electrons .",
    "some agreement has been achieved that the relevant physics of the cuprate high - temperature superconductors is covered by the two - dimensional one - band hubbard model,@xcite @xmath0 here @xmath1 denote the hopping matrix elements , @xmath2 is the density at site @xmath3 with spin `` @xmath4 '' , @xmath5 , @xmath6 the chemical potential , and @xmath7 the local coulomb repulsion .    in recent years",
    "there has been substantial progress in the understanding of the ground - state properties of the hubbard model due to the development of quantum - cluster theories,@xcite such as cluster extensions of the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) , i.e.   the dynamical cluster approximation @xcite and the cellular dmft @xcite , or the variational cluster approach ( vca).@xcite these cluster calculations confirm the fact that the ground state away from half - filling has a non - vanishing superconducting order parameter@xcite with a pairing interaction of predominantly d - wave character.@xcite recent vca calculations@xcite suggest that at low electron and hole doping the two - dimensional hubbard model is in a symmetry - broken mixed af+sc state where both the antiferromagnetic ( af ) and the superconducting ( sc ) order parameters are finite .",
    "this is consistent with recent cellular dmft calculations.@xcite when going to higher dopings , the system displays a tendency to phase separate into an af+sc phase at lower doping and a pure sc phase at higher doping .",
    "the vca accesses the physics of a lattice model in the thermodynamic limit by optimizing trial self - energies generated by a reference system .",
    "the above - mentioned vca calculations are based on a reference system consisting of small ( @xmath8 ) isolated clusters tiling the infinite lattice .",
    "this generates trial self - energies which are very short ranged spatially .",
    "hence , there is the obvious question for the robustness of the results as a function of the size of the individual clusters . up to now , it was not possible to consider larger cluster sizes and , at the same time , reach a sufficient accuracy to resolve the tiny energy scale driving phase separation , especially in the electron - doped case .",
    "the reason is that an accurate evaluation of the vca grand potential has required a _ full _ diagonalization of the cluster hamiltonian ( see ref .   for details ) which has severely restricted the available cluster sizes .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present a new method for the evaluation of the vca grand potential based on the lanczos method which leads to sufficiently accurate results even for larger clusters where full diagonalization is no longer possible . using this method we investigate the competing phases in the two - dimensional hubbard model at zero temperature for clusters up to 10 sites .",
    "this implies a substantial qualitative step forward as short - range correlations between different cooper pairs can be included ",
    "opposed to calculations based on @xmath9 clusters .",
    "the variational cluster approach is one of the possible approximation schemes that can be constructed within the self - energy - functional theory ( sft ) .",

    "the stationary solutions are obtained _ within _ the subspace of self - energies @xmath20 of the simpler problem that is spanned by varying @xmath19 .",
    "this restriction constitutes the approximation .",
    "details of the approach are described in refs .  .",
    "the vca @xcite is generated within the sft by choosing as a reference system a set of isolated clusters which tile up the original infinite lattice . by construction",
    ", the vca correctly incorporates correlation effects in the electron self - energy up to the length scale given by the cluster size . beyond this scale it acts like a mean - field approximation .",
    "one of the main advantages of the vca as compared to the simpler cluster perturbation theory @xcite consists in its ability to describe ( normal and off - diagonal ) long - range order by including suitably chosen fictitious symmetry - breaking weiss fields in the set of variational parameters .",
    "microscopically coexisting phases can be obtained using several weiss fields .",
    "the method links in a consistent way the static thermodynamics with the frequency - dependent one - particle excitation spectra ( photoemission ) .",
    "details of the approach have been described elsewhere .",

    "( [ eq : ocalc ] ) ) .",

    "the major difficulty consists in finding the poles @xmath43 of the vca green s function .",
    "this can be done in the following way : consider the lehmann representation@xcite of @xmath24 which can be cast into the form@xcite @xmath51 where @xmath52 refers to the one - particle orbitals of the cluster ( typically @xmath53 but it can also include an orbital index ) .",

    "should , in principle , provide precisely the required poles and matrix elements eq .",
    "( [ qam ] ) . in practice , however , there are some difficulties , as we discuss below . within the lanczos method the matrix elements @xmath72 of a cluster green s function at @xmath73 are determined in @xmath74 separate lanczos procedures.@xcite in each procedure",
    ", one takes as a lanczos initial vector one element of the sets @xmath75 where @xmath59 is the cluster ground state . in principle",
    "the poles should be the same for all matrix elements of the green s function . in practice , however , the poles obtained by the @xmath74 runs are slightly different from each other due to the limited numerical accuracy of the lanczos method .",
    "therefore , this kind of lanczos algorithm is not suited for the `` @xmath35-matrix '' evaluation of the grand potential described above , since merging all matrix elements of @xmath76 into the compact form eq .",
    "( [ gpq ] ) would results in a too large matrix @xmath71 that can not be diagonalized .",
    "fortunately , the problem can be overcome by means of the so - called _ band lanczos _",

    "the dimension of the matrix @xmath71 is given by the number of iteration steps @xmath78 in the lanczos procedure .",
    "in this case , one only needs two lanczos procedures instead of @xmath74 . using this method",
    ", one introduces an error due to the limited set ( @xmath78 ) of the excited states in the reference system that are kept in the lanczos calculation .",
    "generally , however , this error is extremely small since excitations with large weight result from states which converge very fast with increasing @xmath79 .",
    "these excitations with large weight , on the other hand , are just those which are dominant in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ocalc ] ) compared to excitations with small weight.@xcite    we have checked the accuracy of our method by considering the symmetry - broken antiferromagnetic phase of the hubbard model at half - filling ( fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",

    "however , our results do not exclude microscopic phase separation to persist for @xmath101 .",
    "the inclusion of long - range coulomb interaction would then be necessary in order to `` frustrate '' the phase separation occurring in the plain hubbard model and produce microscopic inhomogeneous phases , such as stripes.@xcite we stress that at this point only qualitative estimates for @xmath101 rather than a convincing finite - size scaling are possible . for a discussion on these issues",

    "in fact , @xmath106 is already an order of magnitude smaller than for hole doping in the @xmath25 cluster .",
    "@xcite in addition , already for @xmath32 the transition from the af+sc to the pure sc phase has become continuous at least within numerical accuracy . in this case , the weak phase separation observed at the mean - field level for small clusters was simply a signal of a _ tendency _ of the system to produce _ microscopically _ inhomogeneous phases ( such as stripes ) , as conjectured in ref .  .",

    ", the d - wave sc gap appears to be too large for the slightly overdoped case @xmath109 .",
    "furthermore , for higher dopings one expects a decrease of the weight of the upper hubbard band which is much stronger than visible in the @xmath109 spectrum .",
    "the reason for these shortcomings is probably a too strong admixture of the half - filled cluster ground state : in the absence of superconductivity and for not too high doping , the particle density of the reference system ( the isolated cluster ) is @xmath116 . in our case ,",
    "deviations from cluster half - filling are introduced due to a non - vanishing sc weiss field only .",

    "a physically better description of the spectral density at higher dopings can only be achieved when ( in the absence of superconductivity ) starting from a cluster ground state with @xmath118 .",
    "this yields a corresponding sft grand potential which has to be compared with the sft grand potential for the @xmath116 stationary point .",
    "note that for a vanishing sc weiss field , the vca can not give a grand potential that is continuous in the entire doping range .",
    "this is an artifact of the vca which levels off and eventually becomes irrelevant in the large - cluster limit .",

    "this stationary point , however , exhibits an sft grand potential which is _ higher _ as compared to that of the @xmath117 solution and , consequently , should be disregarded .",
    "it is nevertheless interesting to discuss the spectral density of this ( metastable ) state which is shown in fig .  [ fig6 ] .",
    "as could have been expected , the sc gap is much smaller ( and actually not visible on the scale of the figure ) and , as compared to the corresponding spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , the weight of the upper hubbard band is clearly reduced .",
    "moreover , signatures of magnetic order are no longer visible in this spectrum .",
    "we have developed a new method to evaluate the vca grand potential which avoids numerical integrations over real or matsubara frequencies , even for large clusters , for which a complete diagonalization is not feasible .",
    "this provides a sufficient accuracy to study the cluster - size dependence of the phase - separation tendency obtained in previous works .",
    "the results of the present paper suggest that in the hole - doped case phase separation observed for small clusters persists for @xmath101 , i.e. in the exact ground state , while it eventually disappears in case of electron doping .",
    "this would explain why there is no clear sign of stripes in electron - doped materials , and could possibly be related to the much smaller ( or even absent ) pseudogap energy scale with respect to hole - doped materials.@xcite",

    "notice that the maximum cluster size we can reach is smaller than in conventional lanczos calculations .",
    "this is due to the fact that ( i ) we do not conserve particle number within the cluster in the sc phase , ( ii ) we have open boundary conditions within the cluster , and ( iii ) the cluster exact diagonalisation has to be reiterated many times before convergence in the three variational parameters ( see below ) has been achieved .",
