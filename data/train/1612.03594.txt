    "in the last years , graphene oxide ( go ) has attracted remarkable interest as a precursor for a large - scale and low - cost production of graphene - based materials and as a fundamental constituent in new functional composite materials for optoelectronics , photovoltaics , and nanobiology devices.@xcite go is obtained by liquid exfoliation of chemically oxidized graphite ( graphite oxide);@xcite at a later stage , a graphene - like material known as reduced graphene oxide ( rgo ) can be derived from go , by removing the oxygen functionalities.@xcite however , after more than 150 years since its discovery , many questions remain open about the exact chemistry and structure of ( r)go at the atomic scale .",
    "@xcite    currently , the most acknowledged model for go corresponds to a nonstoichiometric structure with a random arrangement of epoxide ( -o- in bridge position ) and hydroxyl ( -oh ) functionalities at both sides of the carbon basal plane , with small residual nonfunctionalized graphitic areas .",
    "@xcite difficulties in defining the exact relative amount and local arrangement of oxygen groups arise from the strong dependence of go chemistry and structure on the specific graphite precursor and oxidation parameters.@xcite moreover go turned out to be unstable in air and water , resulting in spontaneous reduction and flakes fragmentation.@xcite the uncertainties on go naturally reflect on rgo , whose chemistry and structure also depend on the particular reduction method and parameters.@xcite this lack of knowledge represents a strong limit for the understanding of ( r)go physical properties and hence for a controlled use of these promising functional materials .",
    "new insights could be provided only through the use of improved characterization techniques . up to now",
    ", several spectroscopic techniques have been used to determine the type and amount of oxygen functional groups . in particular ,",
    "the oxygen level has been estimated mainly by elemental analysis , xps and edx on a variety of samples going from graphite oxide powders to ( r)go films and thin flakes .",
    "the oxygen content has been evaluated in a range between about 15 and 35 atomic percent ( at.% ) , i.e. between @xmath15:1 and @xmath12:1 in terms of the c / o atomic ratio . in rgo",
    "the oxygen content can be lowered to a limit of 0.4 at.% ( @xmath1250:1 c / o atomic ratio ) , depending on the particular reduction process.@xcite however , these values can only be considered as spatial average quantifications , that can not account for the irregular chemistry of go . indeed ,",
    "strong structural inhomogeneities at the nanometer scale have been revealed in both go and rgo by high resolution transmission electron microscopy ( hrtem).@xcite    decisive evidence on go chemistry could only be derived by spectroscopy at the atomic scale .",
    "electron energy - loss spectroscopy ( eels ) in a scanning transmission electron microscope ( stem ) could in principle be suitable for such analysis , providing elemental quantification by core eels mapping and chemical structure analysis through energy - loss near - edge structures ( elnes ) , down to the atomic scale.@xcite however , the limited use of stem - eels for the study of go and rgo@xcite resides in the strong sensitivity of these materials to high energy electron irradiation .",
    "for instance , atoms mobility and fast amorphization have been clearly demonstrated by time series of hrtem images , at 80 kv acceleration voltage.@xcite illumination sensitivity is indeed highly expected in the case of go and rgo , since single or few layer thick specimens and light atoms are intrinsically more affected by radiation damages , such as knock - on of carbon atoms and radiolysis of oxygen functionalities resulting in mass loss .",
    "irradiation effects in a stem could in principle be strongly reduced by the use of low accelerating voltages , low electron - dose , and sample cooling .",
    "@xcite    in this work , thanks to a dedicated experimental setup combining a liquid nitrogen ( ln ) cooling system at the sample stage with a low noise ln cooled ccd camera , we investigate few layer go and rgo by core eels spectrum imaging in a stem microscope in low dose acquisition modes .",
    "we show that the oxygen content in individual ( r)go flakes is strongly heterogeneous at the nanometric scale and that specific near - edge carbon fine structures could be associated with different oxygen contents and bindings , indicating separated chemical phases . finally ,",
    "on the basis of these experimental evidence and complementary dft - based numerical simulations , we suggest a structural model for the highly oxidized regions in go where all carbon atoms are functionalized by -oh groups .",

    "the illuminated region has an initial oxygen content of about 45% ( as derived from the spectrum in fig.[chronospim].a ) that progressively reduces as a result of the increasing electron dose , as shown in fig.[chronospim].b .",

    "variations in the near - edge fine structures are a typical indicator of radiation damages affecting chemical bonding and atomic orbital hybridization.@xcite on this basis , it has been possible to define an upper limit for the electron dose of about @xmath10 e@xmath11@xmath8 , below which no substantial changes occur neither in the flakes stoichiometry nor in eels fine structures .",

    "a spectrum image has been acquired over the @xmath12 @xmath13 wide area marked in fig.[carta - go].a and the resulting haadf image is shown in fig.[carta - go].c .",

    "the haadf intensity depends on both the amount of matter ( thickness and areal density ) and the chemical species ( atomic number ) .",

    "two well separated domains with oxidation levels centered at @xmath132 at.% and @xmath140 at.% are visible , as confirmed by the associated image histogram in fig.[carta - go].g .",
    "a third less extended domain ( bottom left corner in the map ) corresponds to @xmath145 at.% with maximum local content of almost 50 at.% . when interpreting these results it must be considered that for each pixel the eels signal is integrated over the specimen thickness .",
    "hence , a nonhomogeneity in the relative quantification map can result from a spatial variation of the local oxidation level in regions with a constant number of layers or from the local superposition of additional layers with a different oxidation level . in fig.[carta - go].f",
    "an increase of the oxygen relative content is visible from the left to the right side of the map forming two well separated regions .",
    "the oxygen integrated k - edge map ( fig.[carta - go].e ) shows the same trend : the right side area does contain a higher amount of oxygen . on the contrary ,",
    "the intensity of the carbon integrated k - edge ( fig.[carta - go].d ) is almost uniform , indicating that the flake has a constant carbon thickness along the region displaying the oxygen gradient .",
    "therefore these results show a variation of the oxidation level within an individual flake , forming spatially well separated oxidation phases which are not correlated with the flake thickness .",

    "therefore despite the fact that the local oxygen concentration can be extremely high , the average oxygen content in individual flakes is @xmath125 at.% , which is in good agreement with spatially averaged values reported in the literature.@xcite regions up to a few hundred nanometers wide are characterized by an almost uniform oxidation level ( at a 3 - 10 nm scale ) , while the transition between two oxidation phases occurs in the space of few tens of nanometers .",

    "weak correlations appear occasionally , not systematically , in some limited areas .",
    "namely , in the central region of the spectrum image the carbon k - edge intensity is almost constant , while the oxygen k - edge signal varies and may be responsible for the contrast variation in the haadf image .",

    "the 290.1 ev peak appears particularly sensitive to irradiation damages , as shown by fig.[chronospim].c .",
    "after reduction ( fig.[finestructure - c].b ) the sharpness of the @xmath17 and @xmath19 peaks , with a trace of @xmath19 excitonic feature at 291.6 ev @xcite , reveals a very good recovery of the graphitic network .",
    "an additional well - defined peak at 287.2 ev ( a ) is observed ( the two spectra shown correspond to 7 oxygen at.% and 12 at.% ) . rarely and in some limited regions , other weak fine structure peaks have been distinguished , i.e. peak b ( 5 oxygen at.% ) .",
    "these a and b spectral features are below the detection limit for lower oxygen concentrations .",
    "these results show that specific near - edge fine structures and thus coordination states of the carbon atoms correspond to different oxidation rates .",
    "the energies of eels peaks in fig.[finestructure - c ] are compatible with previous xanes results which however could not separate the specific near - edge fine structures shown here due to spatial averaging over wide regions with different oxygen levels .",
    "absorption peaks indicated as a - c had been attributed in the literature to c - o @xmath20 symmetry antibonds : lower energy peaks to single bonds and higher energy peaks to double bonds .",
    "more precisely , hydroxyl groups had been generally associated with peak a , epoxide groups to peak a or b , and carbonyl and carboxyl groups to peak b or c.@xcite in the @xmath19 region , carbonyl groups have been related to peak d.@xcite in a recent stem - eels investigation a shallow peak a has been observed at the carbon k - edge and assigned to epoxide , while no peak c has been detected.@xcite these assignments , still largely debated , have been obtained by comparison with reference spectroscopic signatures of aromatic molecules@xcite or spectra simulations on hypothetical go atomic structures.@xcite however , as shown a number of times by numerical simulations , @xcite the spatial configuration of functional groups within ( r)go deeply affects their orbital associated energies , and these might strongly differ from those of the same groups within molecules . moreover , the sensitivity of the material suggests the need of caution while comparing spectroscopic results .",

    "several complex atomic models for go have been proposed in the last 20 years .",
    "@xcite oxygen adsorption is usually described in terms of the basic functional groups of epoxide , hydroxyl , carbonyl ( -co ) and carboxyl ( -cooh ) .",
    "the last two groups involve multiple bonding with a single carbon atom , which can occur at edges or at defects within the graphene lattice . on the contrary",
    ", a complete and in principle reversible functionalization of a perfect graphene network can be achieved with epoxides and hydroxyls , resulting in a c / o ratio of 2:1 ( 33 oxygen at.% ) for solely epoxides functionalization , 1:1 ( 50 oxygen at.% ) for solely hydroxyls functionalization , and intermediate values for mixed structures . up to now , the lerf - klinowski model@xcite has been the most referred to . in this representation , different oxygen groups are randomly distributed on both sides of the carbon sheets , with coexisting graphitic and oxidized regions , thus forming a partially functionalized structure .",
    "hydroxyls and epoxides are supposed to be the dominant groups on the basal plane , while carboxyls are expected to fill carbon dangling bonds at the sheet edges and vacancy sites.@xcite carbonyl groups as ketones and/or quinones are also generally expected at the plane edges . a high proximity among hydroxyls and epoxides and the presence of five- and six - membered lactols and ester carbonyls",
    "have been proposed on the basis of nmr studies.@xcite with respect to our experimental observation , the lerf - klinowski model is consistent with go regions with a 20 oxygen at.% content , but can not account for the much higher oxygen concentration locally observed by eels ( @xmath145 at.% ) .",
    "the presence of water molecules in the atomic structure of go is still under debate .",
    "water molecules are expected to form hydrogen bonds with oxygen functional groups on go.@xcite we expect reasonably that any possible intercalated water would have been removed from the here observed flakes , during the preparation process .",
    "indeed , differently from the common protocol where go is directly deposited on a substrate as a water dispersion , in this work we employed dried go which was successively redispersed in ethanol and ultrasonicated .",
    "moreover observation conditions involve high vacuum levels ( @xmath3 mbar ) , resulting in evaporation of residual water molecules . on the basis of these considerations",
    "we expect a negligible amount of water .",
    "this hypothesis is corroborated by our observed eels fine structures .",
    "indeed , the strong intensity and sharpness of the fine structure peaks at the carbon k - edge correlated with a high oxygen content ( fig.[finestructure - c].a ) suggest that a significant amount of carbon atoms is involved in a specific kind of carbon - oxygen bond .",
    "thus , the @xmath145 oxygen at.% in go can not arise from intercalated water and should be ascribed to oxygen directly bound to carbon .",
    "recently it has also been proposed that the go surface could be decorated by strongly bound highly oxidized debris coming from the oxidation process .",
    "@xcite in the present work , an important contribution of such debris to the calculated oxygen content is not compatible with our spectroscopic investigations : their presence would result in an increase of intensity in the k - edge maps of both oxygen and carbon ( as an additional go layer ) and hence in a correlation between the two maps , which is not observed in fig.[carta - go].d - e .",
    "moreover , the highly oxidized residues could contain at most @xmath150 oxygen at.% , considering a fully functionalized structure ( hydroxyls on the basal plane and carbonyls - carboxyls at the edges , as discussed above ) . in fig.[carta - go].g",
    "the local oxygen content reaches almost 50 at.% and represents an integrated measurement over the flake thickness : even assuming the presence of debris , the underlying go layer(s ) has to be necessarily almost 50 at.% oxidized .",
    "this experimental evidence reinforces the criticism recently raised against the debris go model .",
    "@xcite    first principle simulations have shown that in go there is a strong driving force toward a phase separation in fully functionalized regions ( epoxides and/or hydroxyls ) and pristine graphene regions.@xcite the limit of 50 at.% local oxygen concentration observed in this work is not consistent with a full functionalization dominated by epoxides , since the oxygen content would tend to 33 at.% . a large presence of carboxyl and carbonyl groups",
    "should also be excluded , because such a highly defective structure could hardly be reduced to a highly graphitic arrangement compatible with the carbon k - edge fine structures observed in rgo flakes .",
    "go containing almost 50 at.% of oxygen and converting into a highly graphitic structure when reduced can be explained only by an almost hydroxyl saturated graphene lattice .",
    "this limit structure is analogous to graphane@xcite ( i.e. , hydrogen saturated graphene ) , and hydroxyl groups should alternate at the two sides of the carbon plane in order to minimize strain.@xcite this limit configuration is presented in fig.[model ] after optimization by dft - lda .",
    "the graphene network is shown to be strongly distorted , with carbon atoms puckered out of plane by about 0.26  leading to a change of their hybridization state from pure sp@xmath5 to partial sp@xmath0 .",
    "in contrast with graphane , where the sp@xmath0 carbon hybridization reduces the in plane cell parameter ( @xmath12.42 ),@xcite we obtain an increased cell parameter of 2.58  , ( about 5% higher than dft - lda optimized graphene ) and a c - c bond length higher than diamond ( 1.59  ) . oxygen steric hindrance and hydrogen bonding between neighboring groups forming hydroxyl chains are responsible for this in plane expansion as for graphene edges functionalized by hydroxyl groups where the accumulated strain is released via the formation of static out - of - plane ripples.@xcite it might be challenging to directly observe this lattice expansion through diffraction because uniform and continuous highly functionalized domains are of little extension .",
    "furthermore , the accurate determination of the unit cell parameter by electron diffraction is a nontrivial technique itself , for in 2d materials the reciprocal space of monolayers consists of rods and thus the total intensity of the diffraction spots changes little as a function of the tilt angle , while the spots broadening is important .",
    "@xcite        eels fine structures for highly oxidized go ( 30 - 50 oxygen at.% , fig.[finestructure - c].a ) can thus be interpreted in the limit of this hydroxyl saturated graphene model .",
    "the extremely low intensity of the @xmath17 peak can be ascribed to the loss of sp@xmath5 hybridization at carbon atoms .",
    "the 287.2 ev peak ( a ) , which is observed also for lower oxygen rates , can be assigned to c - oh antibonds , in agreement with previous xanes works.@xcite the peak at 290.1 ev ( c ) can not be associated with c - o antibonds of other oxygen functional groups , because they are expected to be present only in a small amount and this is not compatible with the strong intensity of the peak .",
    "nevertheless , the interpretation of this feature remains unclear .",
    "fine structures for lower oxidation rates ( 10 - 30 oxygen at.% , fig.[finestructure - c].a ) are much less defined .",
    "this can be due to a higher variety of functional groups and the high number of possible configurations that they can assume at the graphene network .",
    "the presence of the @xmath17 peak and of a weak sp@xmath5 @xmath19 peak infers a limited presence of nonfunctionalized carbons . aside from peak",
    "a ascribed to hydroxyl groups , peak b can be attributed to epoxide groups .",
    "after reduction the very intense and sharp peak a observed at higher residual oxygen regions ( fig.[finestructure - c].c , @xmath115 oxygen at.% ) would then correspond to the presence of solely hydroxyl groups .",
    "this interpretation is compatible with the identification of several simple reaction routes for epoxide reduction by hydrazine , while hydroxyl removal mechanisms are still debated.@xcite considering the same assignments as in go , the weak peak b in rgo indicates a small residual amount of epoxides .",
    "again , the difference in the intensity of features a and b can derive from their relative amount ( hydroxyl probably remain the dominant species also after reduction ) and the different number of configurations that these functional groups can form at the carbon network .",
    "in conclusion we have investigated the oxygen distribution in go and rgo by core eels spectroscopy in a stem microscope .",
    "a spatial resolution of 3 nm for spectrum images has been achieved by reducing radiation damage through optimized acquisition conditions and an experimental setup combining a low noise ccd detection camera with a liquid nitrogen cooled sample stage .",
    "previous spectroscopic quantifications have provided only overall oxygen contents , and go and rgo have been often described as chemically homogeneous materials at a nanometric scale .",
    "we have shown that within individual flakes the oxygen content strongly varies , forming homogeneous domains with a lateral side of few tens of nanometers . in go different oxidation levels have been identified , with a maximum local concentration of almost 50 at.% of oxygen , corresponding to a c / o ratio of 1:1 . in rgo",
    "the residual oxygen mainly concentrates in domains with about 5 oxygen at.% .",
    "specific fine structures at the carbon k - edge can be clearly associated with different oxidation phases .",
    "highly oxidized go displays a shallow graphitic signature with extremely intense and sharp additional peaks , not observed before . in rgo",
    "the graphitic character is extensively recovered with weakened additional features .",
    "the assignment of the spectroscopic peaks is still debated in the literature , and the previously proposed mixed epoxides - hydroxyls atomic model for go can not account for the highest oxygen concentrations observed in this work .",
    "we propose a limit structural model for these highly oxidized regions , in which all carbon atoms are functionalized with -oh groups , leading to an sp@xmath0 carbon 2d material analogous to graphane . a strong signature for -oh antibonds",
    "can then be identified in go carbon near - edge fine structures . in rgo , a sharp -oh antibond peak , localized at",
    "highest oxidized regions , infers that this group is the dominant surviving species .",
    "the presence of domains fully covered with hydroxyl groups has critical implications for the engineering of the electronic structure of individual flakes .",
    "indeed , it strongly affects the hydrophilicity of the flakes and the interaction with molecules from the gas and vapor phase.@xcite furthermore , the presence of a dense hydroxyl layer on ( r)go sheets has important consequences for the anchoring of metal and ceramic nanoparticles or biomolecules and the assembly of individual flakes into corresponding macroscopic forms.@xcite",

    "<S> the type and distribution of oxygen functional groups in graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide remain still a subject of great debate . </S>",
    "<S> local analytic techniques are required to access the chemistry of these materials at a nanometric scale . </S>",
    "<S> electron energy loss spectroscopy in a scanning transmission electron microscope can provide the suitable resolution , but go and rgo are extremely sensitive to electron irradiation . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we employ a dedicated experimental setup to reduce electron illumination below damage limit . </S>",
    "<S> go oxygen maps obtained at a few nanometers scale show separated domains with different oxidation levels . </S>",
    "<S> the c / o ratio varies from about 4:1 to 1:1 , the latter corresponding to a complete functionalization of the graphene flakes . in rgo </S>",
    "<S> the residual oxygen concentrates mostly in regions few tens nanometers wide . </S>",
    "<S> specific energy - loss near - edge structures are observed for different oxidation levels . by combining these findings with first - principles simulations we propose a model for the highly oxidized domains where graphene is fully functionalized by hydroxyl groups forming a 2d - sp@xmath0 carbon network analogous to that of graphane . </S>"
