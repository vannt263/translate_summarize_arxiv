    "it has been increasingly realized that dissecting the genetic and chemical circuitry prevents us from further understanding the biological processes as a whole . in order to understand the complexities involved",
    ", all reactions and processes should be analyzed together . to this end , network theory will be used .",
    "it has been getting fast recognition to study systems which could be defined in terms of units and interactions among them .",
    "these studies revealed that the available data from gene co - expression network share some unexpected features with other complex networks as diverse as the internet routers . in order to understand the behavior of complex systems such as gene co - expression network ,",
    "several simple models , based on the simple principles and captures some essential features of the system , have been introduced , these models are@xcite .    in this paper , by using network theory and random matrix theory ( rmt ) , we analyze gene co - expression network .",
    "first we generate network from the gene co - expression data collected form six brain regions that are metabolically relevant to alzheimer s disease @xcite by using appropriate threshold , and then study the spectra of this network under the rmt framework .",
    "information about the genes that are preferentially expressed during the course of alzheimer s disease could improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of this common cause of cognitive impairment in senior persons , provide new opportunities in the diagnosis , early detection , and tracking of this disorder , and provide novel targets for the discovery of interventions to treat and prevent this disorder .",
    "information about the genes that are preferentially expressed in relationship to normal neurological aging could provide new information about the molecular mechanisms that are involved in normal age - related cognitive decline and a host of age - related neurological disorders , and they could provide novel targets for the discovery of interventions to mitigate some of these deleterious effects .",
    "co - expression networks have also been known as relevance networks .",
    "the terminology has been introduced by butte and kohane @xcite . since",
    "then properties of the relevance networks have been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : after introductory sub - section on the relevance of network theory and gene co - expression network , we discuss the recent outcome of rmt analysis of complex networks in the following subsection b. main goals of our eigenvector analysis are written in the subsection c. section ii describes the important achievements of rmt and explains its various properties we use in our analysis .",
    "section iii sheds light on the data and network construction . section iv presents various numerical results .",
    "section v concludes the paper with a discussion on the relevance of current analysis , as well suggests future directions .",
    "our previous work @xcite showed that various vastly studied model networks follow random matrix predictions of gaussian orthogonal statistics ( goe ) at the level repulsion domain .",
    "we demonstrated that nearest neighbor spacing distribution ( nnsd ) of protein - protein interaction network of budding yeast follows rmt prediction as well @xcite .",
    "this is a promising result which suggests that these networks can be modeled as a random matrix chosen from an appropriate ensemble .",
    "the universal goe statistics of eigenvalues fluctuations could be understood as some kind of randomness spreading over the protein - protein interaction network and model networks capturing real world properties .",
    "recently , covariance matrix of amino acid displacement has been analyzed under rmt framework @xcite .",
    "the analysis shows that the bulk of eigenvalues follows universal goe statistics of rmt . in the present paper , we analyze gene co - expression network @xcite under rmt framework . first we calculate nearest neighbor spacing distribution of network spectra , and then perform eigenvector analysis to detect nodes having specific contribution to network .",
    "it is now well known that various real world systems are scale - free network@xcite .",
    "the scale - free nature of networks suggests that there exist few nodes with very high degrees . motivated by this finding they suggested that since these nodes are responsible to hold the whole networks and henceforth are the most important ones .",
    "some other analysis ( by newman and others ) of real - world networks show that complex networks have community or module structure @xcite .",
    "modules are the division of network nodes within which the network connections are dense , but between which they are sparser .",
    "the modularity concept assumes that system functionality can be partitioned into a collection of modules and each module performs an identifiable task , separable from the functions of other modules @xcite .",
    "analysis of module structure involves _",
    "betweenness _ measure .",
    "betweenness of an edge is defined as the number of shortest path between pairs of nodes going through the edge .",
    "betweenness studies of real world networks suggests that the nodes connecting the different communities are the most important ones , which has been verified in the metabolic networks by amaral et .",
    "al.@xcite .",
    "above description emphasizes on the importance of nodes depending on their position in the network , as these nodes characterize network properties . on the other hand erds - rnyi ( er ) and strogatz - watts ( sw ) models",
    "emphasize on the importance of random connections in the networks . in the er model any two nodes",
    "are connected with probability @xmath1 .",
    "one of the most interesting property of er model is the sudden emergence of various global properties , such as , emergence of a giant cluster . as @xmath1 increases , while number of nodes in the graph remains constant , the giant cluster emerges through a phase transition @xcite .",
    "further , the sw model shows the small world transition with the fine tuning of number of random connections @xcite .",
    "our previous rmt analysis of the spectra of sw model networks @xcite show that at the sw transition there is a transition to the _ spreading of randomness _ in the network characterized by the correlations between nearest eigenvalues .",
    "in the current paper we analyze spectra of the gene co - expression network under rmt framework .",
    "particularly we study eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix of this network .",
    "the spectra has two parts , one part which follows rmt predictions of universal goe statistics and other part which does not follow rmt prediction .",
    "the eigenvectors deviating from the rmt prediction provide information about the _ influential or important nodes _ in the network .",
    "rmt deals with the statistical properties of matrices with independent random entries . to be self - consistent",
    ", we give a brief introduction of the rmt here , and explain various rmt properties of eigenvector components which we will use in our analysis .",
    "rmt was initially proposed to explain the statistical properties of nuclear spectra @xcite .",
    "later this theory was successful applied in the study of the spectra of different complex systems such as disordered systems , quantum chaotic systems , large complex atoms @xcite .",
    "recent studies illustrate the usefulness of rmt in understanding the statistical properties of the empirical cross - correlation matrices appearing in the study of multivariate time series of followings : the price fluctuations in the stock market @xcite , eeg data of brain @xcite , variation of various atmospheric parameters @xcite , etc .",
    "recent analysis of complex networks under rmt framework @xcite show that various network models and real world network also follow universal goe statistics .",
    "furthermore localization of eigenvectors have also been used to analyze various structural and dynamical properties of real and model networks @xcite .    in the following ,",
    "we introduce spacing distribution and @xmath2 statistics of random matrices .",
    "we denote the eigenvalues of a network by @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is size of the network and @xmath5 . in order to get universal properties of the fluctuations of eigenvalues ,",
    "people usually unfold the eigenvalues by a transformation @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is averaged integrated eigenvalue density @xcite .",
    "since we do not have any analytical form for @xmath7 , we numerically unfold the spectrum by polynomial curve fitting ( for elaborate discussion on unfolding , see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "after unfolding , average spacings is _ unity _ , independent of the system . using the unfolded spectra",
    ", we calculate spacings as @xmath8 .",
    "nnsd is defined as the probability distribution ( @xmath9 ) of these @xmath10 s . in the case of goe statistics , + @xmath11    the @xmath2-statistic measures the least - square deviation of the spectral staircase function representing the averaged integrated eigenvalue density @xmath12 from the best straight line fitting for a finite interval @xmath13 of the spectrum , i.e. , @xmath14 ^ 2\\,d \\overline{\\lambda } \\label{eq - delta3}\\ ] ] where",

    "again we find that the top contributing nodes are not the ones with very high degree .",
    "for two different threshold values tables [ table1 ] and [ table2 ] show the largest contributing co - expressing genes in the corresponding localized eigenvectors .",
    "we find that choosing threshold is very important for the analysis of gene co - expression networks , as we can see that top five largest contributing nodes differ entirely ( except one ) as threshold value is changed .",
    "this suggests that , though the gross structure of whole network ( fig .",
    "[ nodes ] ) and scale - free property , remains unchanged , value of threshold has a strong effect on the network leading to entirely different sets ( except few ) of largest contributing nodes for two different threshold values .",

    "the nnsd of adjacency matrix of the largest connecting component of the network follows universal goe statistics ( with @xmath86 ) .",
    "this universality adds one more feature , based on the spectral correlations , to the gene co - expression network which is common with different model networks @xcite proposed to capture various structural properties of real world networks .",
    "the nnsd gives information about the short range correlations among the eigenvalues . to probe the long range correlations we have studied spectral rigidity via @xmath87 statistics",

    "deviation from the universal rmt predictions identify system - specific , non - random properties of system under consideration , might provide clues about important interactions . to extract these system dependent information we have performed eigenvector analysis .",
    "this analysis reveals that there are some eigenvectors which are highly localized .",
    "the component @xmath21 of a given eigenvector relates to the contribution of node ( corresponding gene ) @xmath21 to that eigenvector .",

    "inverse participation ratio ipr , as defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq - ipr ] ) , distinguishes between one eigenvector with approximately equal components and another with a small number of large components .",
    "according to the rmt predictions , the largest contributing nodes ( genes ) in the localized eigenvectors may have important function , or important functional relations among them .",
    "the largest connected component is scale - free indicating the structural importance of few nodes ( hubs ) .",
    "eigenvector analysis shows that top contributing nodes in the localized eigenvectors have relatively low degrees .",
    "note that genes which are hubs or those which connect different communities are also important , as shown by several earlier studies in the network framework @xcite , but the aim of the present work is look for the important genes beyond these structural measures .",

    "all most all the top contributing nodes differ for two different threshold value , indicating impact on the global properties of the underlying network .",

    "several studies have shown that the development of multi - target drugs might give better results than the traditional methods targeting a single protein .",
    "single target - design might not always give satisfactory results , as there might be a backup system , which replaces the function of the inhibited target protein . by using multi - target drugs one can decrease the functionality of entire protein cascades producing more effective results . for example , studies have shown that aging is strongly linked with age - related diseases , and they share a common signaling network . signaling",

    "multi - target drugs attacking hubs of the protein - protein interaction network , hub - links ( links connecting hubs ) , bridges ( inter - modular links having high betweenness centrality ) or nodes in the overlap of numerous network modules , might give better results @xcite .",
    "similarly , targeting genes corresponding to the largest contributing nodes in localized eigenvectors may lead to important effect as well .",
    "future investigations are sought in order to know the functionality of these genes corresponding to the top contributing nodes in the localized eigenvectors , which could be then used for such multi - target drug designs .",
