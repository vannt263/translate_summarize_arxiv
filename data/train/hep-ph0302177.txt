    "the minimal standard model ( sm ) is a very successful theory of the elementary particles known today .",
    "but it should not be the final theory , because it has too many unknown parameters to be put by hand .",
    "most of these parameters are in the fermion part of the theory .",
    "we do nt know the origin of the quarks and leptons , as well as how to determinate their mass and number theoretically .",
    "we have to get their information all from experiments .",
    "there is still not a successful theory which can unify all the four basic interactions .",
    "perhaps our _ elementary particles _ have substructure and we need a more fundamental theory than sm .",
    "this is beyond the scope of our current experiments . on the other hand , the recent measurement of the muon anomalous magnetic moment by the experiment e821 @xcite disagrees with the sm expectations at more than 1.6@xmath6 - 3@xmath6 @xcite level .",
    "moreover , there are convincing evidences that neutrinos are massive and oscillate in flavor @xcite .",
    "it seems to indicate the presence of new physics .",
    "the discovery of neutrino oscillation has been one of the most exciting experimental results in the recent years @xcite . as the experimental data accumulating in the super - kamiokande collaboration @xcite , more results published by sno @xcite , k2k @xcite and chooz @xcite experiments .",
    "these experiments give possible signals of new physics beyond sm .    in this paper , we consider the sequential fourth generation model to estimate the possible contributions to the decay @xmath7 from the exchange of the fourth up - type quark @xmath2 . from the point of phenomenology , there is a realistic question one may ask : what is the number of the fermion generations or weather there are additional quarks or leptons other than the known three generations .",
    "the present experiments can tell us there are only three generation of fermions with @xmath8 neutrinos whose mass is smaller than @xmath9 @xcite , but the experiments do nt exclude the existence of other kind of additional generation , such as the fourth generation , with a @xmath10 neutrino , i.e. @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "latest studies in the electroweak sector allow the existence of a fourth generation with heavy dirac neutrino @xcite .",
    "many authors studied models which extend the fermions part , such as vector - like quark models @xcite , sterile neutrino models @xcite and the sequential four generation standard model ( sm4 ) @xcite . here",
    "we consider the sequential fourth generation , non -supersymmetric model , which includes an up - like quark @xmath2 , a down - like quark @xmath12 , a lepton @xmath13 , and a heavy neutrino @xmath14 besides the known three generation of fermions in the sm .",
    "the properties of these new fermions are the same as their corresponding counterparts of other three generations except their masses and ckm matrix elements .",
    "many attempts have been made recently about the fourth generation @xcite and the experimental searches of the fourth generation particles @xcite . in our previous papers @xcite",
    ", we investigated the rare @xmath15 meson decays with the fourth generation @xcite , @xmath16 in @xmath17 systems and @xmath18 in sm4 @xcite .",
    "we got some interesting results , such as the new effects of the 4th generation particle on the meson decays and cp violation .",
    "we also got the constraints of the fourth generation ckm matrix factors @xcite . recently",
    ", these decays in fourth generation were considered again . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the phases of the fourth generation ckm matrix factors , @xmath19 , have been included .",
    "the exclusive b decays with the fourth generation were investigated in ref .",
    "these rare decays are very interesting to study the new physics effects of the fourth generation . in this paper",
    ", we would like to investigate the rare decay @xmath20 with the fourth generation .    as a loop - induced flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) process the inclusive decay ( at quark level )",
    "@xmath21 is in particular sensitive to contributions from those new physics beyond the sm .",
    "there is a vast interest in this decay . on the experimental side , only upper limits ( @xmath22 ) on the branching ratios of @xmath23 decay",
    "are currently available @xmath24 which are roughly two orders above the sm predictions @xcite , @xmath25 within the sm , the electroweak contributions to @xmath26 and @xmath27 decays have been calculated some time ago @xcite , the leading - order qcd corrections and the long - distance contributions were evaluated recently by several groups @xcite .",
    "the new physics corrections were also considered , for example , in the two - higgs doublet model @xcite and the supersymmetric model @xcite .",
    "there is also study concerning other exclusive channels @xcite . in a previous paper @xcite , we calculated the technicolor corrections to the rare decays @xmath28 in the qcd factorization approach .",
    "the great progress in theoretical studies recently encourage us to do more investigations about this decay in the sequential fourth generation model .",
    "this paper is organized as the following : in section 2 , we present the formulae for the decays @xmath7 in sm and the fourth generation model .",
    "we also obtain the constraints of the fourth generation ckm matrix factors , @xmath29 and @xmath30 from experiments in this section . in section 3 ,",
    "we give the numerical analysis of the branching ratios in the fourth generation model .",
    "the conclusions are in the last section .",
    "same as in our last paper @xcite , up to the corrections of order @xmath31 , the effective hamiltonian for @xmath32 at scales @xmath33 is just the one for @xmath34 and takes the form @xmath35\\ , , \\label{eq : heff}\\ ] ] where in view of @xmath36 , we have neglected the term proportional to @xmath37 . here",
    "@xmath38 are the usual four - fermion operators whose explicit form is given below .",
    "the last two operators in the eq.([heff_at_mu ] ) , characteristic for this decay , are the _",
    "magnetic  penguin _ operators . the complete list of operators is given as follows @xmath39 it is the magnetic @xmath40-penguin operator @xmath41 , which plays the crucial role in this decay",
    ". the effective hamiltonian for @xmath42 is obtained from eqs.([eq : heff]-[eq : o8 g ] ) by the replacement @xmath43 .    in the case of the fourth generation",
    "there is an additional contribution to @xmath44 from the virtual exchange of the fourth generation up quark @xmath45 . in fig.1 , we draw the relevant feynman diagrams which contribute to the decays @xmath46",
    ". the wilson coefficients of the dipole operators are given by @xmath47 where @xmath48 represent the contributions of @xmath45 to the wilson coefficients .",
    "we recall here that the ckm coefficient corresponding to the @xmath49 quark contribution , i.e. , @xmath50 , is factorized in the effective hamiltonian as given in eq .",
    "( [ heff_at_mu ] ) .",
    "the formulae for calculating the wilson coefficients @xmath51 are the same as in the sm except exchanging @xmath45 quark for @xmath49 quark .    in sm4",
    ", the quark mixing matrix can be written as , @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the elements of the @xmath55 ckm mixing matrix of the sm4 , which now contains nine parameters , i.e. , six angles and three phases .",
    "the rest elements without prime in the matrix are the usual three generation ckm matrix elements .",
    "the current experimental bounds of @xmath56 and @xmath57 can be found in ref .",
    "the factor @xmath56 can be constrained by the decay @xmath58",
    "@xcite @xmath59 or @xmath60 considering the unitarity conditions of the ckm matrix , @xmath61 and taking the average values of the sm @xmath62 ckm matrix elements from ref .",
    "@xcite , we obtain , @xmath63 in the following numerical calculation , we take the values @xmath64 and @xmath65 , for illustration .    for the ckm factor @xmath57 , we can get its constraint from the present experimental value of @xmath66 @xcite . also considering the unitarity conditions of the ckm matrix , @xmath67",
    "we finally get @xmath68 in the next section , we will take the values @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 in numerical calculation respectively .",
    "we first calculate the decay @xmath5 ( the formulas in the case of @xmath75 can be obtained just by the replacement of @xmath43 ) . for this exclusive decay of @xmath76 meson",
    ", we need to deal with both of the long distance and short distance qcd corrections in the @xmath76 meson side . applying the factorization assumption",
    ", we shall adapt a phenomenological approach where the long distance effects are replaced by a few non - perturbative parameters .",
    "in other words we simply evaluate the hadronic matrix element of @xmath77 from one particle irreducible ( 1pi ) and one particle reducible ( 1pr ) feynman diagrams , relying on a phenomenological model . before doing so",
    ", it is important to note that @xmath78 is apparently non - local due to internal @xmath79 or @xmath80 quark propagator . to handle these non - local terms",
    ", one observes that the @xmath79 quark inside the @xmath76 meson carries most of the meson energy , and its four velocity can be treated as equal to that of @xmath76 . hence one may write @xmath79 quark momentum as @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the common four velocity of @xmath79 and @xmath76 . with this parametrization",
    ", we have @xmath83 where the second equation is based on a constituent picture @xcite that @xmath79 and @xmath84 quarks share the total energy of @xmath76 quark is @xmath85 as @xmath86 denotes the momentum of @xmath80 quark in @xmath87 . ]",
    ". therefore @xmath85 should be taken as the four momentum of the constituent @xmath84 quark . with eq.([pp ] ) , @xmath78 is readily made local .",
    "we then compute the amplitude for @xmath5 using the following relations @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the @xmath76 meson decay constant which is about @xmath90 mev according to recent lattice qcd calculations @xcite .",
    "the total amplitude is now separated into a cp - even and a cp - odd part @xmath91 we find that @xmath92 with @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 where @xmath96,\\nonumber \\\\ a_c & = & ( c_1+c_3-c_5)n_c+(c_2+c_4-c_6 ) , \\nonumber \\\\ a_s & = & a_b={1\\over 4}\\left[(c_3+c_4-c_5)n_c+(c_3+c_4-c_6)\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the functions @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 are defined by @xmath100 where @xmath101 , and @xmath102    the decay width for @xmath5 is simply @xmath103    to obtain numerical results , we have set light quark masses to zero and used @xcite @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "furthermore , we take @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "the numerical values for wilson coefficients @xmath110 evaluated in sm at @xmath111 are listed in table  [ t2 ] .",
    "we first consider the decay mode @xmath112 .",
    "figs.2 , 3 and 4 show the branching ratio @xmath113 @xmath114 the mass of @xmath2 and the fourth generation ckm matrix factors @xmath115 and @xmath116 , respectively . from these figures , we find that the sm4 predictions for the branching ratio @xmath113 are rather different from that of the standard model .",
    "the decay rates can be enhanced by about 1 - 2 orders relative to the sm prediction in the reasonable range of @xmath117 and @xmath30 .",
    "this implies that the new physics signal of the fourth generation model may come from the decay of @xmath112 .",
    "the future experiment of lhcb in cern can test it . from fig.2 , we find that the branching ratio of @xmath112 increase with the mass of @xmath2 for the fourth generation ckm matrix factor , @xmath118 and @xmath119 . when @xmath120 , the curve increase rapidly with @xmath117 .",
    "but when @xmath121 , the branching ratio changes very slowly .",
    "because the fourth generation ckm matrix factor , @xmath30 , is small in the latter case .",
    "it can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ ceff4 ] ) that the new physics contribution is proportional to the size of the ckm factor @xmath30 , thus it is very important in the new physics contribution with @xmath117 . from figs.3 and 4 , one can also see that , the branching ratio of @xmath112 decease with @xmath115 but increase with @xmath116 , since @xmath115 is negative and gives the opposite contributions as sm to the coefficients @xmath122 ( see eq .",
    "( [ ceff4 ] ) ) .    for the decay @xmath123 , it is easy to find from figs.5 and 6 that the new physics contribution to the branching ratio is tiny",
    ". it is shown that it is not suitable to test the new physics signals from the 4th generation in this channel .",
    "the prediction of the branching ratio in the 4th generation model is between @xmath124 and @xmath125 , when we take the reasonable values of @xmath117 ( from 200 gev to 1000 gev ) and @xmath29 ( see eq . ( [ vtd ] ) ) .",
    "this numerical result is fully in the range of the sm prediction ( see eq . ( 4 ) ) .",
    "the reason is that the experimental constraint of the 4th generation ckm matrix element factor @xmath29 is very stringent ( only at @xmath126 level , see eq.([vtd ] ) ) .",
    "we also find that the curves change little along with the variations of @xmath117 and @xmath29 .",
    "the reason is also from the tiny @xmath29 .",
    "we can see that the branching ratios of both @xmath112 and @xmath112 decays strongly depend on the size of the related mixing elements .",
    "as a summary , the size of new physics contributions to the rare decays of @xmath7 from the fourth generation strongly depends on the values of the masses of the new heavy up quark @xmath2 and the 4th generation ckm matrix elements , @xmath30 and@xmath29 .",
    "the results in the 4th generation model are quite different from the sm case for decay @xmath112 , its branching ratio can be enhanced by about 1 - 2 orders of magnitude",
    ". a large branching ratio of @xmath127 decay measured in experiment may be a new physics signal of the 4th generation model .",
    "but for decay @xmath123 , because of the tiny values of 4th generation ckm matrix element , @xmath3 , the new physics contribution to @xmath4 is very small and can not be distinct from the sm prediction .",
