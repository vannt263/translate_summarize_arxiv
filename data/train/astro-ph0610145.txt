    "supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) with masses @xmath5 have been convincingly inferred to be present in the centers of nearby galaxies ( see kormendy 2004 for a review ) , and are generally believed to reside in most , if not all , galaxies with a spheroidal stellar component ( kormendy & gebhardt 2001 ; ferrarese & ford 2005 ) .",
    "however , little is known about their low mass counterparts , i.e. black holes with masses in the range of @xmath6 , presumably in the centers of ( dwarf ) galaxies .",
    "these intermediate - mass black holes ( imbhs ) may provide the ` missing link ' in understanding the formation and evolution of smbh seen today . in current models of galaxy evolution in a hierarchical cosmology",
    ", smbh must have formed from much less massive `` seed '' black holes and grown up by accretion and/or merging .",
    "it is likely that there exists a population of imbhs in the present universe , that have not the opportunity to be full - grown ( e.g. , islam , taylor & silk 2004 ) .",
    "the search for imbh turns out to be a difficult task , however , since imbhs are beyond the reach of direct measurement using star / gas dynamics , by which most nearby smbh are unveiled ( see van der marel 2004 for a review ) .",
    "the most promising approach is to search for dwarf active galactic nuclei ( agn ) that are hosted in small galaxies  a scaled - down version of typical seyfert galaxies and quasars .",
    "so far , convincing evidence for the existence of imbhs has been found in only two agn , ngc  4395 ( filippenko & ho 2003 , hereafter fh03 ; @xmath7 , peterson et al .",
    "2005 , hereafter p05 ) and pox 52 ( @xmath8 , barth et al .",
    "2004 , hereafter b04 ) , with ngc  4395 being the only one having accurate black hole mass measurement via reverberation mapping .",
    "in addition , greene & ho ( 2004 ; hereafter gh04 ) found 19 imbh candidates from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; stoughton et al .",
    "2002 ) first data release ( abazajian et al . 2003 ) , whose black hole masses were estimated by using the linewidth - luminosity - mass scaling relationship ( kaspi et al .",
    "all these objects , except ngc 4395 , have a very high accretion rate close to the eddington limit .    in this paper",
    ", we report the discovery of a dwarf agn with the estimated black hole mass as low as @xmath9 , that is hosted by sdss j160531.84 + 174826.1 ( hereafter j1605 + 1748)a dwarf ( most likely disk ) galaxy at a redshift @xmath0 .",
    "it was found from our on - going program of a systematic search for agn with candidates imbhs or hosted in dwarf galaxies from the sdss fifth data release .",
    "we assume a cosmology with h@xmath10=70 km  s@xmath2  mpc@xmath2 , @xmath11=0.3 and @xmath12=0.7 .",
    "j1605 + 1748 was spectroscopically observed in the sdss on june 12 , 2005 with 4048s exposure and was classified as a galaxy by the sdss pipeline .",
    "it has a redshift of @xmath13 as determined using the [ o iii]@xmath14 line .",
    "figure 1 shows the rest frame spectrum with the galactic reddening corrected ( @xmath15 , schlegel et al .",
    "1998 ) , which is dominated by starlight of the host galaxy . to subtract the starlight and the nuclear continuum , we followed our method as described in detail in zhou et al .",
    "the fit was good ; the standard deviation of the distribution of the relative residuals @xmath16 in the emission line - free region around h@xmath1 and h@xmath17 is @xmath18 , just the noise level with respect to the signal . the left - over emission line spectrum is plotted in figure 1 .",
    "we fit the emission lines using the code described in detail in dong et al .",
    "the peaks of the [ n ii]@xmath19 doublet are well separated from the h@xmath1 line , that shows an apparent broad component , owing to the relatively high s / n ratio ( @xmath20 ) in this spectral range and the narrowness of the lines .",
    "we model the [ n ii ] doublet with two gaussians with the line ratio @xmath216583/@xmath216548 fixed to the theoretical value 2.96 .",
    "we use two gaussians to model the narrow and broad components of h@xmath1 , assuming the narrow component has the same profile and redshift as the [ n ii ] doublet ( see zhou et al .",
    "2006 for a full account of this assumption ) .",
    "a good fit is achieved , with a minimum reduced @xmath22 ( d.o.f = 92 ) , yielding a line width @xmath23 km s@xmath2  fwhm for the broad h@xmath1 component ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "it has been noted by vron - cetty et al .",
    "( 2001 ) that lorentzian is a better profile to describe the broad lines in narrow line seyfert 1s , that have fwhms @xmath24 km s@xmath2 . in view of this argument",
    ", we use a lorentzian for the broad h@xmath1 component and repeat the above fit ; this yields a similarly good fit with reduced @xmath25 ( d.o.f = 92 ) , but a model over - predicted in the [ n ii]@xmath26 region by 7% of the [ n ii]@xmath26 peak height .",
    "so we adopt the gaussian fit . to test the reliability of this broad h@xmath1 component ,",
    "we model the whole h@xmath1 line with a single gaussian with the center and width as free parameters ; the result is unacceptable with a reduced @xmath27 ( d.o.f = 95 ) and large residuals remained around h@xmath1 .",
    "we therefore believe that the broad h@xmath1 line is real . for the h@xmath17 line ,",
    "since its s / n ratio is relatively low ( @xmath28 ) , we fix the profile parameters to those of h@xmath1 , for both the narrow and broad components . for the [ o iii]@xmath29 doublet , we only fit [ o iii]@xmath14 alone with one single gaussian because [ o iii]@xmath30 is jaggy .",
    "we find the fit is good and no extended wing for [ o iii]@xmath14 .",
    "we fit other narrow lines with a single gaussian profile .",
    "the results of emission line fitting are listed in table 1 .",
    "the balmer decrement is found to be 4.2 for the broad lines and 4.0 for the narrow lines , indicating an extinction color excess @xmath310.36 and 0.31 , respectively , assuming an intrinsic balmer decrement of 3 ( dong et al .",
    "2005 , zhou et al .",
    "2006 ) and a smc - like extinction curve . the ratios of the narrow lines [ o iii]@xmath14/h@xmath32 3 and [ n ii]@xmath33/h@xmath34 place j1605 + 1748 into the agn regime on the diagnostic diagram ( veilleux & osterbrock 1987 )",
    ". it would be considered as a seyfert 1.8 in the osterbrock ( 1981 ) classification scheme , just like ngc 4395 ( filippenko & sargent 1989 , hereafter fs89 ) and pox 52 ( b04 ) .",
    "we retrieved an archival hst image for j1605 + 1748 , taken with the wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) in june 1995 with a 500s exposure .",
    "the galaxy fell on the wide field camera ( 0.1/pixel ) as a `` bonus '' in an observation of mkn 298 ( malkan et al .",
    "the f606w filter was used , which has a mean wavelength of 5947  and a fwhm of 1500  ( 1997 may wfpc2 synphot update ) .",
    "the data reduction was carried out following malkan et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . on the hst image",
    ", galaxy is well resolved thanks to the superb spatial resolution .",
    "it is largely elongated with a major axis of about 6 , and a bright , point - like nuclear source is evident .",
    "we perform structural decomposition using a `` two - step '' strategy : firstly fit to the one - dimensional surface brightness profile and then 2-d fitting to the image using the package galfit ( peng et al .",
    "we construct surface brightness models , for both the 1-d and 2-d cases , with a combination of different structural components : a point source represented by a point - spread function ( psf ) that is generated with the tiny tim software ( ver .",
    "6.3 ) for wfpc2 ; galactic component(s ) parameterized by either an exponential or a srsic @xmath35 function ( srsic 1968 , see graham & driver 2005 for a concise review ) , or a combination of any of these two .",
    "we start off the fitting procedure with the simplest one - component model , and add in one more component only if the fit can be improved significantly by doing so .",
    "an additional constraint comes from the above optical spectral decomposition , which sets an upper limit on the contribution from a point source to be @xmath36% the total flux at @xmath37 .",
    "firstly , the azimuthally averaged 1-d radial profile of surface brightness is extracted using the iraf ellipse task .",
    "the best - fit model , which is plotted in figure 2 along with the measured profile , is composed of a central point source plus two srsic components , one dominating the inner part of the galaxy and the other dominating the outer part . leaving off the point source or one of the two srsic gives rise to unacceptable fits with significant and strongly structured residuals .",
    "the need for a central point source is not surprising , as revealed from the hst image ( figure 3 ) .",
    "the presence of the second galactic component is found to be significant , as shown in figure 2 .",
    "secondly , we perform 2-d image decomposition using galfit , taking the results of the 1-d fits as initial values of the fitting parameters .",
    "the best - fit model turns out to be the same as for the 1-d fitting , but with somewhat different parameter values , especially for the central point source .",
    "we adopt the result from the 2-d fitting ( table 2 ) in this paper because 2-d modeling can recover a nuclear source much reliable than 1-d fitting ( peng et al .",
    "also displayed in figure 3 are the images of the residuals and of the model components .",
    "the fit is good in general , with the standard deviation of the distribution for the fractional residuals @xmath38 within the sky region 10 times or more brighter than the sky level . in comparison ,",
    "other models with the same or less number of model components give rise to unacceptable fitting results that have much larger @xmath39 and structures in the residuals .",
    "for easy comparisons with ngc 4395 and pox 52 , we derive the johnson magnitudes from the f606w flux using the iraf / synphot package .",
    "we assume a continuum similar to that of ngc 4395 ( @xmath40 , filippenko , ho , & sargent 1993 ) for the central point source , a template bulge spectrum ( kinney et al . 1996 ) for the inner srsic .",
    "we further make use of the sdss spectrum (  2.1 ) for the outer srsic since it accounts for @xmath41 per sent of the total f606w flux .",
    "the results are given in table 2 .",
    "as a remote member of the cluster abell 2151 , j1605 + 1748 was observed serendipitously several times by rosat and xmm - newton .",
    "we retrieved from archives the observations with good effective exposures , one with the rosat position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) in 1993 , one with the rosat high resolution imager ( hri ) in 1997 , and one with the xmm - newton epic - pn in 2003 .",
    "x - ray data reduction were performed following the standard procedures , using the ftools ( ver .",
    "6.1 ) utilities and the science analysis system ( ` sas ` , ver 6.0.0 ) for rosat and xmm - newton data , respectively .",
    "table 3 lists some relevant parameters for the x - ray observations and data reduction . for the xmm - newton data , exposure periods which suffered from high flaring background caused by soft protons",
    "are removed .",
    "source counts are extracted from a circle ( see table 3 ) and background events are extracted from source - free regions using a concentric annulus for pspc and hri , and two circles at the same ccd read - out column as the source position for pn . in each of these observations an x - ray source was detected at the @xmath42 significance levels at a position coincident with the optical point source of the galaxy within one @xmath43 positional error .",
    "the position of the x - ray source detected with xmm - newton is ra=16:05:31.87 , dec=17:48:26.11 ( j2000 ) , with an error circle of 0.9 ( @xmath44 ) in radius .",
    "the spectral fitting is carried out using xspec ( ver .",
    "due to the small number of source counts , 58 for pspc ( 0.12.4 kev ) and 79 for pn ( 0.3 - 8kev ) , the spectra are rebinned to have a minimum of 6 counts in each energy bin , and the cash - statistic is adopted in the minimization instead of @xmath39 .",
    "we fit simultaneously the two spectra assuming the same spectral models with the parameters tied together except the normalizations .",
    "the spectra can be fitted with a power law with a photon index @xmath45 and an absorption column density close to the galactic value ( @xmath46@xmath47 ) .",
    "the unabsorbed 210 kev flux is @xmath48 ergs s@xmath2 @xmath47  measured by xmm - newton , corresponding to a luminosity of @xmath49 ergs s@xmath2 .",
    "the best fit normalization at 1 kev is a factor of 2 higher for rosat than for xmm - newton . to test the significance of this variation , we search for the maximum confidence contours in the parameter space of the two normalizations ( two free parameters ) within which they differ from each other ; we find that the variation is marginally significant at the @xmath5090% level .",
    "the hri flux is found to be roughly consistent with the xmm - newton value assuming the same spectral shape .",
    "in summary , observations of j1605 + 1748 reveal the presence of an optical bright point source based on its hst image , a broad h@xmath51 component with fwhm 781 km s@xmath2  ( after correction for the instrumental broadening of 141 km s@xmath2  fwhm ) and agn - like narrow emission line ratios , a non - thermal x - ray luminosity ( @xmath52 ergs s@xmath2  in 210 kev ) and possible x - ray variability .",
    "all these observational facts point to the presence of a seyfert 1 type dwarf active nucleus in j1605 + 1748 .",
    "this can be further supported by the striking similarities between j1605 + 1748 and the two well known dwarf agn ngc 4395 and pox 52 , whose properties are summarized in table 4 .",
    "in fact , the agn in j1605 + 1748 lies in between ngc 4395 and pox 52 in terms of the observed luminosities of both h@xmath51 and optical continuum .",
    "furthermore , j1605 + 1748 is more luminous at hard x - rays than ngc 4395 ( no data available for pox 52 so far ) .",
    "the equivalent width of its broad h@xmath17 component ( @xmath53 , relative to the nuclear continuum calculated from the hst f606w flux of the point source ) is typical of seyfert 1.8/1.9 nuclei and similar to that of ngc 4395 ( fs89 ) .",
    "we estimate the mass of its central black hole following the widely used linewidth - luminosity - mass scaling relation ( e.g. , vestergaard 2002 ; mclure & jarvis 2002 ; gh04 ) . the intrinsic monochromatic luminosity at 5100  is estimated to be @xmath54 ergs s@xmath2  from the h@xmath1 luminosity using the @xmath55 relation given by greene & ho ( 2005 ) ) , @xmath56 ergs s@xmath2  for @xmath57 . ] , incorporating the extinction correction that is derived from the balmer decrement for the broad lines (  2.1 ) . using equation ( 6 ) in greene & ho ( 2005 )",
    ", we find a black hole mass @xmath58 .",
    "the uncertainty of the black hole mass thus estimated is not well understood , however . as pointed out by vestergaard & peterson ( 2006 ) ,",
    "the statistical accuracy of the masses from such a scaling relationship is a factor of @xmath59 ( @xmath44 ) , and , for individual mass estimates , the uncertainty can be as large as an order - of - magnitude . using the blr - size@xmath60luminosity relations from kaspi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and bentz et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , we find a black hole mass of @xmath61@xmath62 , respectively ; here we adopt the formalism and scale factor from peterson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and onken et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , with @xmath63ergs s@xmath2 , @xmath64 km s@xmath2  estimated from the broad h@xmath1 component .    assuming a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) similar to that of ngc 4395 , the bolometric luminosity @xmath65 for j1605 + 1748 is estimated to be @xmath66 ergs s@xmath2  by scaling their @xmath67  luminosities using the ngc 4395 data in p05 .",
    "this is consistent with the bolometric correction @xmath68 used for normal qsos ( kaspi et al .",
    "then , the eddington ratio @xmath69 is @xmath70 for a black hole mass of @xmath71 .",
    "this indicates that j1605 + 1748 is at a high accretion state , similar to pox 52 .",
    "the broad - band spectral index @xmath72 \\simeq -1.1 $ ] agrees well with the extrapolation down to low luminosity of the @xmath73luminosity relation given by strateva et al .",
    "( 2005 , see also yuan brinkmann & siebert 1998 ) for radio - quiet agns , similar to the result for a small sample of imbh agn ( greene & ho 2006 ) .    as results from the above hst image decomposition analysis (  2.2 ) ,",
    "the galaxy is composed of three components , a central point source as the agn , an inner srsic with @xmath74 ( 114pc ) , and an outer srsic with @xmath75 ( 1kpc ) , which account for 6.0 , 2.6 , 91.4 per cent of the total f606w light , respectively .",
    "we tend to identify the outer srsic to be a galactic disk , because of 1 ) its exponential - like radial profile with the srsic index @xmath76 , close to 1 for exponential ) .",
    "] , 2 ) the disky isophote shape ( @xmath77 ) , 3 ) the apparent extreme flattening ( hubble type e6.3 based on the axis ratio ) , that is very unlikely for an elliptical ( binney & de vaucouleurs 1981 ) , and particularly , 4 ) the existence of the additional inner srsic component .    with an effective radius of 0.18 ,",
    "the inner srsic is merely resolved by the wide field camera ; however , fits without this component result in large residuals and an over - predicted point source , as displayed in figure 2 .",
    "its size is too large for being a nuclear star cluster .",
    "the fitted image has a boxy shape ( @xmath78 ) and a rather flat profile ( @xmath79 ) , suggesting a box-/peanut - shaped bulge or an edge - on _ nuclear _ bar  their presence in disk galaxies are known for many years ( eg .",
    "burbidge & burbidge 1959 ; evans 1951 ; de vaucouleurs 1975 ) .",
    "we prefer the nuclear bar speculation because there is a @xmath5017  mis - alignment between its major axis and that of the disk , that is more natural for the bar scenario ; moreover , a bar can provide an efficient mechanism of fueling gas to the agn but a bulge can not ( e.g. , shlosman et al . 1989 ) .",
    "in fact , a boxy bulge may evolve from a bar , or may simply be ( part of ) a bar viewed edge - on ( see kormendy & kennicutt 2004 for a review ) . regardless of its nature",
    ", we predict the mass of the central black hole based on the empirical @xmath80 correlations using the absolute magnitudes ( table 3 , corrected for the internal extinction @xmath81 ) . using the formalism from marconi & hunt ( 2003 ) and mclure & dunlop ( 2002 )",
    ", we find @xmath82 and @xmath83@xmath62 , respectively , roughly consistent with our estimate from the scaling relation considering the large uncertainties .",
    "furthermore , following the empirical relation between @xmath84 and bulge concentration ( graham et al .",
    "2001 , graham et al .",
    "2003 ) , we obtain @xmath85@xmath62 , also consistent with the virial mass estimate .",
    "either bars or boxy bulges ( as a kind of `` pseudobulges '' [ kormendy 1993 ] ) form out of disk material ( kormendy & kennicutt 2004 ) .",
    "so , probably just as stated by carollo ( 2004 ) , `` the requirement for making a supermassive central black hole is that the galaxy is capable of reaching sufficiently high central baryonic densities . ''",
