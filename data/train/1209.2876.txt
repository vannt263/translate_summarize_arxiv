    "the relativistic harmonic oscillator ( rho ) is a topic of fundamental importance in physics . although widely discussed in the past ( see , for example ref .",

    "the spinless salpeter equation with a quadratic potential can not be solved in analytical form @xcite and the corrections induced by the relativistic effect in the phase space evolution of an ensemble of particles ruled by a harmonic potential have not been discussed yet .",
    "this point is raised by a genuine practical necessity , emerging in charged beam transport in magnetic systems .",
    "in particular , in the case of propagation through quadrupole lenses , the beam is ruled by a potential of harmonic oscillator type @xcite .",
    "it may therefore happen that , in absence of a clear distinction , phase space distortions due to relativistic corrections could be misinterpreted and ascribed , for example , to quadrupole aberrations .",
    "the dynamics of the relativistic harmonic oscillator is , indeed , not harmonic at all .",
    "the relativistic nature of the problem induces non - linear corrections which determines a genuine anharmonic behavior .    in this paper",
    "we will consider the classical aspects of the rho and we will treat the problem _",
    "ab initio_. just to give an idea of the problems we are going to treat , we consider the case of a relativistic particle subject to a linear potential whose hamiltonian is @xmath0 and the associated equations of motion @xmath1 are readily integrated as @xmath2 the non - relativistic limit of these equations is given by @xmath3\\,\\frac{c^2}{a } , \\qquad\\qquad   \\pi^{\\mathrm{(nr ) } } ( t ) = \\pi_0 = \\frac{p_0}{m_0\\,c } = \\gamma_0\\,\\beta_0,\\ ] ] ( @xmath4 ) and is recognized as the classical equation for the uniformly accelerated motion .",
    "it has been noted by harvey @xcite that the derivation , in an unambiguously lorentz invariant fashion , of the hamiltonian of a relativistic particle subject to a scalar potential , hinges on the relaxation of the requirement that the rest mass be a constant . the procedure proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite is reminiscent of the lorentz covariant theory of gravitation ( see last reference in @xcite ) , where the rest mass is potential dependent . by adhering to this point of view ,",
    "an alternative relativistic hamiltonian with a linear potential can be written , according to the prescription @xmath5 where it is evident that the potential redefines the particle mass , and the following hamiltonian is obtained @xmath6 the physics described by this hamiltonian totally differs from that of hamiltonian .",
    "for example , the latter can be exploited to study the equation of motion of a relativistic charged particle subject to an external electric field , while eq .",

    "we see that the particle motion is essentially oscillatory , and for short times ( @xmath19 ) the non - relativistic equations of the uniformly accelerated motion is obtained .    in the forthcoming sections we will discuss analogous problems in the case of the harmonic potential .",
    "we will address our analysis by studying the liouville equation describing the evolution of phase - space distributions of an ensamble of relativistic particles .",
    "let us now consider the following hamiltonian @xmath20 which rules the relativistic evolution of a particle with mass @xmath7 subject to a potential @xmath21 .",
    "the solution of this dynamical problem is accomplished by solving the associated hamiltonian equations , that introducing the notation @xmath22 , can be written as @xmath23 where @xmath24    the solution of eq .",
    "can be formally expressed as the following lie series @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the hamilton evolution operator , and the following notation has been used @xmath27 this procedure is reminiscent of analogous methods adopted in quantum mechanics to treat the time - dependent schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "the problem is not in general amenable for analytical solutions .",
    "for example , in classical ( non - relativistic ) mechanics exact solutions can be obtained only in case of quadratic hamiltonians . in the relativistic case",
    "even quadratic potentials are not amenable for an exact solution . in these situations ,",
    "the search of solutions of approximate nature is the only way to address the problem .",
    "the symmetric exponential split rule has been proven an efficient tool . according to it ,",
    "we can write @xmath28 where @xmath29 the solution of the problem is then obtained by a repeated application of the evolution operator calculated for short time interval steps of duration @xmath30 , namely @xmath31    since we are interested in particle ensemble distributions ruled by relativistic hamiltonians , we can adopt a complementary procedure based on the solution of the liouville equation associated with the hamiltonian @xmath32 . it describes the evolution of the particles phase space density distribution @xmath33 and reads ( @xmath34 is time in the laboratory frame ) @xmath35 whose solution can formally be written as @xmath36 where the liouville operator @xmath37 is given by @xmath38.\\ ] ] the use of well - known techniques from operator calculus @xcite will be exploited in the forthcoming section to discuss the problems concerning the relativistic phase space conservation .",
    "here we just remind that the function @xmath33 transforms as a lorentz scalar and its integral over the phase space variable is normalized to unity .    in the case of free relativistic particles the liouville operator is introduced in the previous section . ]",
    "@xmath39 and , thus , the action of the associated evolution operator on the initial distribution reduces to a shift of the spatial coordinate , namely @xmath40 the liouville operator associated with the hamiltonian is @xmath41 and the evolution of the corresponding phase space distribution function writes @xmath42 , \\pi - \\frac{a\\,t}{c } ; 0\\right).\\ ] ] we will use this equation as a benchmark of an approximate solution based on the split operator method , then applied to the case of more complicated potentials for which no exact solution is available .",
