    "a precise determination of the bottom quark mass , being one of the fundamental parameters in the standard model ( sm ) , is of paramount interest in several areas of present day particle phenomenology . in the past",
    ", qcd moment sum rule analyses have been successfully applied for extracting charm and bottom quark masses from experimental data on the charmonium and bottomium systems respectively @xcite .",
    "the basic ingredient in these investigations is the vacuum polarisation @xmath3 , @xmath4 induced by the vector current @xmath5 for a heavy quark @xmath6 .",
    "inclusive quantities , like @xmath3 , where no reference to a particular hadronic state is needed , are especially well suited for a description in terms of quarks and gluons .",
    "theoretically , @xmath3 can be calculated in the framework of the operator product expansion ( ope ) .",
    "on the phenomenological side , the imaginary part of @xmath3 is a physical quantity , related to the experimentally measured cross section for @xmath7 : @xmath8 because of its analytic properties , @xmath9 satisfies a dispersion relation . taking @xmath10 derivatives of @xmath9 at @xmath11 ,",
    "one arrives at the following expression for the @xmath10th moment @xmath12 , @xmath13 where @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15 is the heavy quark pole mass , defined as the pole of the perturbatively renormalised propagator .    under the assumption of quark - hadron duality",
    ", the moments @xmath12 can either be calculated theoretically in renormalisation group improved perturbation theory , including non - perturbative condensate contributions , or can be obtained from experiment . in this way",
    ", hadronic quantities like masses and decay widths get related to the qcd parameters @xmath16 , quark masses and condensates .    as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : mn ] ) , for large values of @xmath10 the moments become more and more sensitive to the quark mass , but also to the threshold region which is dominated by large coulombic corrections growing like @xmath17 .",
    "the situation is greatly improved by utilising the quark mass in the @xmath1 scheme where perturbative qcd corrections turn out to be much smaller than in the pole mass scheme .",
    "in addition for large @xmath10 the non - perturbative terms , the first being the gluon condensate , start to dominate over the perturbative contribution .",
    "it will prove possible to find an intermediate range of @xmath10 where the sum rules are already very sensitive to the bottom quark mass and contributions from higher states are sufficiently suppressed , whereas the corrections from higher order as well as non - perturbative corrections are still under control .",
    "the perturbative spectral function @xmath18 can be expanded in powers of the strong coupling constant @xmath19 , @xmath20 with @xmath21 . from this expression",
    "the corresponding moments @xmath22 can be calculated via the integral of eq .",
    "( [ eq : mn ] ) .",
    "the first two terms are known analytically and can for example be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the second order contribution is as yet not fully known analytically .",
    "however , exploiting available results at high energies , analytical expressions for the first eight moments @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) and the known threshold behaviour of @xmath25 , pad approximants for the function @xmath25 could be extracted @xcite .",
    "this information is sufficient for a reliable determination of @xmath23 for @xmath10 in the region of interest .    until now",
    ", our expressions for the moments have been written in terms of the pole quark mass @xmath15 .",
    "the relation between the pole and @xmath1 mass is known up to second order in @xmath19 @xcite : @xmath26\\ ] ] where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are renormalisation scales for coupling and mass respectively .",
    "explicit expressions for @xmath29 and @xmath30 can be found in appendix  a of ref .",
    "@xcite . using this relation",
    "one finds the following expression for the moments @xmath31 and @xmath23 in the @xmath1 scheme : @xmath32    these expressions for the moments will be used in our numerical analysis presented in section  5 .",
    "the leading non - perturbative correction is the gluon - condensate contribution to the massive vector correlator .",
    "it is known at the next - to - leading order @xcite .",
    "the relative growth of @xmath33 is proportional to @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , the non - perturbative contribution grows much faster than the perturbative moments .",
    "in addition , in the pole mass scheme , the next - to - leading order correction to @xmath35 is of the same size or larger as the leading term . because the perturbative expansion for the gluon condensate can not be trusted , we shall restrict our analysis to the range @xmath36 where its contribution to the @xmath37 moments is below 3% .",
    "for different reasons to be discussed below , we shall anyhow restrict the analysis to moments @xmath38 . thus the gluon condensate can be safely neglected .",
    "the first six @xmath0 resonances have been observed .",
    "their masses are known rather accurately , and their electronic widths have been measured with an accuracy which ranges from 3% for the @xmath39 to 23% for the @xmath40 . for our purposes ,",
    "the narrow  width approximation provides a very good description of these states , because the full widths of the first three @xmath0 resonances are roughly a factor @xmath41 smaller than the corresponding masses , and the higher - resonance contributions to the moments are suppressed : @xmath42 where @xmath43 $ ] and the running fine structure constant @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath45 cross - section above threshold is unfortunately very badly measured @xcite . the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : phen ] ) accounts for the contributions to @xmath46 above the sixth resonance as well as additional continuum contributions between @xmath47 and @xmath48 and is approximated by the perturbative qcd continuum .",
    "hence the threshold @xmath49 should lie somewhat lower than the mass of the next resonance which has been estimated in potential models .",
    "it is found to be @xmath50 .",
    "a more precise estimate of @xmath51 can be obtained by requiring stability of the sum rule for very low moments . from the numerical analysis to be discussed below ,",
    "we find @xmath52 . on the other hand only taking into account the first three @xmath0",
    "resonances and requiring stability of the sum rule we obtain @xmath53 as expected .",
    "using the theoretical expression for the moments of eq .",
    "( [ eq : mn ] ) and the phenomenological ansatz ( [ eq : phen ] ) , the bottom quark mass can be calculated as a function of @xmath10 .",
    "this is shown in figure  1 for various values of the input parameters .    in our previous work @xcite , besides @xmath54 , we have also performed a determination of @xmath55 from the @xmath0 sum rule .",
    "it was demonstrated that upon evolution to the scale @xmath56 the value of @xmath57 was completely compatible with current world averages though the error was larger .",
    "thus , in this work we now decided to use @xmath19 as an input parameter within the current average @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath19 is included in the final error on @xmath54 .",
    "although in the @xmath1 scheme the higher order perturbative corrections at a scale @xmath59 are much smaller than in the pole mass scheme , nevertheless for large @xmath10 they become dominant . for our central estimate of @xmath54",
    "we thus followed the same strategy as in ref .",
    "we choose a mass renormalisation scale @xmath28 where the perturbative corrections are minimal in the range of interest for @xmath10 .",
    "this is realised at @xmath60 . for this choice from the solid curve in fig .",
    "1 it is clear that the prediction for @xmath54 is stable even for @xmath61 where the non - perturbative contributions start to become important .",
    "the more ` natural ' choice @xmath59 is displayed in the dotted curve . in this case",
    "the result for @xmath54 is stable up to @xmath62 and then becomes unreliable due to @xmath19 corrections growing large .",
    "for this reason we have restricted the range of @xmath10 from which we determine the bottom quark mass to @xmath63 . including all variations of the input parameters as well as the renormalisation scales in our error estimate  @xcite , as our final result for the running @xmath1 mass @xmath64 we obtain : @xmath65    for very low moments the continuum contribution in eq .",
    "( [ eq : phen ] ) is not very well suppressed and thus @xmath54 displays a strong dependence on the threshold @xmath51 . as has been already discussed in the last section , by requiring stability of the sum rule we obtain @xmath52 ( solid line ) . for comparison , as extreme cases , in fig .  1 we have also plotted the sum rule for the choices @xmath53 ( dashed line ) and @xmath66 ( dot - dashed line )",
    ".    the first case corresponds to using the perturbative qcd continuum above the @xmath67 but nevertheless including the higher resonance contribution .",
    "this is certainly overcounting the continuum contribution .",
    "the second choice would assume a very high mass for the @xmath68 and no additional continuum contribution above the @xmath67 .",
    "this is definitely on the low side of the estimates . as can be seen in fig .",
    "1 , even for these extreme cases using moments with @xmath69 sufficiently suppresses the dependence on the continuum contribution and gives a good determination of @xmath54 .",
    "our updated result for the bottom quark @xmath1 mass @xmath64 as obtained from the sum rules for the @xmath0 system is in very good agreement to other recent determinations also including lattice gauge theory @xcite .",
    "it is @xmath70 higher than our previous determination for @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "the reason was a small inconsistency in implementing the scale dependence of the @xmath1 mass in our numerical program .",
    "however , this shift lies well within the range of our estimated error .",
    "very recently it has become possible to obtain an estimate of the bottom quark mass measuring three - jet rates at lep @xcite .",
    "the natural scale at which @xmath54 is evaluated in this case is @xmath56 .",
    "evolving the value for @xmath54 determined in our analysis to the @xmath71-boson mass , we find : @xmath72 the result obtained from lep measurements is at present much less precise but nevertheless in very good agreement with the value given above . on the other hand",
    "it is the first indication of a scale running of the bottom quark mass in the @xmath1 scheme .",
    "another frequently used mass definition for the bottom quark is the pole mass .",
    "recent determinations of the bottom quark pole mass include @xcite .",
    "the pole mass determination from the @xmath0 system suffers from two difficulties : firstly the @xmath73 corrections in this case are much larger than for the @xmath1 scheme and a resummation of these large coulombic corrections has to be performed .",
    "the second problem is the fact that the pole mass suffers from a renormalon ambiguity which introduces an intrinsic unknown uncertainty .    using our result for @xmath54 given above and the perturbative relation between pole and @xmath1 mass given in section  2 , we obtain @xmath74 .",
    "this result is in agreement with the cited pole mass determinations except for the previous work by the authors where @xmath75 was found .",
    "the discrepancy is due to the fact that in ref .",
    "@xcite the contribution from the coulomb poles has been neglected .",
    "this contribution formally is of @xmath76 and the analysis @xcite was especially aiming for a consistent treatment of higher orders up to @xmath77 .",
    "nevertheless it turned out that the contribution from coulomb poles is very important and should be included .",
    "the analysis in the @xmath1 scheme was not inflicted by such a problem .",
    "we shall come back to these and related questions in a forthcoming publication ."
