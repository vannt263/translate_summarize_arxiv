    "a ring polymer is one of the simplest systems that have the effect of topological entanglement .",
    "the topological state of a ring polymer is given by a knot , and it is fixed after the ring polymer is formed .",
    "the entropy of the ring polymer with the fixed knot is much smaller than that of no topological constraint .",
    "thus , there should be several nontrivial properties in statistical mechanics of ring polymers with a fixed topology .",
    "furthermore , some dynamical or thermodynamical properties of ring polymers under topological constraints could also be nontrivial",
    ". in fact , various computer simulations of ring polymers with fixed topology were performed by several groups @xcite . however , there are still many unsolved problems related to the topological effect , such as the average size of a knotted ring polymer in solution .    in the paper , we discuss how the excluded volume controls the topological effect on the average size of ring polymers in good solution . as a model of ring polymers",
    "we employ a model of self - avoiding polygons consisting of cylindrical segments with radius @xmath3 . through numerical simulation",

    "let us consider the two cases when the radius @xmath3 is very large or very small .",
    "when the radius @xmath3 is very large , the simulation should be related to that of the self - avoiding polygons on the lattice @xcite . on the other hand , when the radius @xmath3 is very small , it is related to random polygons with a fixed topology , as we shall see explicitly through the data .",
    "in fact , there is quite an interesting suggestion @xcite that under a topological constraint the average size of ring polymers with no excluded volume should be similar as that of ring polymers with the excluded volume , since nontrivial entropic repulsion should be derived from the topological constraint .",
    "according to the suggestion , the average size of random polygons with the trivial knot should be given by @xmath4 with respect to the number @xmath2 of polygonal nodes , where @xmath5 is the exponent of self - avoiding walks .",

    "the cylinder radius @xmath3 can be related to the stiffness of some stiff polymers such as dnas @xcite .    in the simulations of the paper ,",
    "we have constructed a large number of cylindrical saps by the cylindrical ring - dimerization method @xcite .",

    "2 , closed squares for @xmath45 are located higher in the vertical direction than closed circles for @xmath44 , through the whole range of @xmath2 both for the trivial and trefoil knots .",
    "let us now consider the ratio of @xmath0 to @xmath6 for a given knot @xmath1 .",
    "if the ratio is larger ( smaller ) than 1.0 , then the average size of saps with the knot @xmath1 is relatively larger ( smaller ) than that of no topological constraint .",
    "we say that the saps with the knot @xmath1 is effectively more ( less ) expanded . in fig .",
    "3 , the ratio @xmath52 versus the number @xmath2 is plotted in a double - logarithmic scale for the trivial and trefoil knots . here",
    ", we have depicted only the case of @xmath44 among many sets of the cylindrical saps with the 14 different values of cylindrical radius .    for the trivial knot , we see in fig .",
    "3 that the ratio @xmath53 is greater than 1.0 when @xmath54 .",
    "thus , the average size of the ring polymers with the trivial knot enlarges under the topological constraint .",
    "it gives a typical example of effective expansion .    in fig .",
    "3 , the graph of the trivial knot is convex downwards : the ratio @xmath53 is almost constant with respect to @xmath2 for small @xmath2 such as @xmath9 ; for @xmath55 the ratio @xmath56 increases with respect to @xmath2 with a larger gradient , and the graph can be approximated by a power law such as @xmath57 . here",
    "the symbol @xmath58 denotes the effective exponent for the trivial knot .",
    "we note that the characteristic length @xmath16 is approximately given by 300 for @xmath44 .",
    "thus , we may say that the power law behavior is valid for @xmath59 .    for the trefoil knot , the graph can be approximated by a power of @xmath2 such as @xmath60 through the range of @xmath61 . here",
    "the symbol @xmath62 denotes the effective exponent of the trefoil knot . in fig .",
    "3 , we find that when @xmath9 the ratio @xmath63 is smaller than 1.0 , while it is larger than 1.0 when @xmath55 .",
    "thus , when @xmath2 is small , the topological constraint of the trefoil knot gives effective shrinking to ring polymers , while it does not when @xmath2 is large .",
    "for a nontrivial knot @xmath1 , we expect that the ratio @xmath64 is less than 1.0 when @xmath2 is small , while it can be larger than 1.0 when @xmath2 is large .",
    "the properties of the ratio @xmath65 discussed in the last three paragraphs are consistent with the simulation results of gaussian random polygons @xcite .",
    "we have found for the random polygons that the double - logarithmic graph of @xmath7 versus @xmath2 is given by a downward convex curve for the trivial knot , while it is given by a straight line for the trefoil knot and also for other several nontrivial knots ; for the nontrivial knots investigated , the ratio @xmath7 is given by some power of @xmath2 such as @xmath66 . thus , there are indeed many important properties valid both for the simulation of the gaussian random polygons and that of the cylindrical saps with a small radius such as @xmath44 .    the observations derived from fig",
    ". 3 should be valid particularly for finite - size systems .",
    "admitting that @xmath2 is finite , we can only understand that the gaussian random polygons and the cylindrical saps have the similar topological properties in common .",
    "if we discuss asymptotic behaviors , saps and random polygons should be quite different .",
    "however , if we consider such properties that are valid for finite @xmath2 , then they can hold both for saps with small excluded volume and random polygons that have no excluded volume .",
    "let us discuss again the convexity of the graph of the trivial knot , which has been observed in fig .",
    "we consider how the convexity depends on the radius @xmath3 . in fig .",
    "4 , the graphs of the ratio @xmath53 versus @xmath2 are given in a double - logarithmic scale for four different values of cylinder radius @xmath3 .",
    "then , we see that the graph with @xmath67 is less convex than that of @xmath44 .",
    "thus , the convexity in the graphs of the effective expansion for the trivial knot should be valid only when cylinder radius @xmath3 is small .",
    "let us assume that the convexity of the graphs of @xmath53 for the small @xmath3 case should correspond to a crossover behavior of @xmath53 with respect to @xmath2 .",
    "then , the crossover behavior could be related to that of gaussian random knots , which is recently discussed by grosberg @xcite for gaussian random polygons . we can discuss the convexity of the double - logarithmic graph of @xmath53 versus @xmath2 , taking an analogy with the crossover of the gaussian random knots .",
    "thus , we call the convexity of the trivial knot in fig .",
    "3 the crossover , hereafter in the paper .    for the non - trivial knots investigated , we do not see any crossover in the graph of @xmath7 versus @xmath2 .",
    "for instance , for the @xmath68 and @xmath49 knots , the slope of the graph near @xmath69 is straight in the double - logarithmic scale .",
    "the crossover at @xmath69 should be valid only for the trivial knot .",
    "we discuss how the ratio @xmath52 depends on the number @xmath2 , considering both the excluded volume effect and the effective expansion due to the topological constraint . in fig . 5 ,",
    "the graphs of the ratio @xmath7 versus @xmath2 for different values of cylinder radius @xmath3 are shown in linear scales : ( a ) for the trivial knot ; ( b ) for the trefoil knot .",
    "let us first consider the large @xmath2 behaviors of the graphs shown in fig .",
    "5 for the trivial and trefoil knots .",
    "the graphs of @xmath52 versus @xmath2 have a common tendency that they become constant with respect to @xmath2 when @xmath2 is very large .",
    "it is particularly the case for the larger values of cylinder radius @xmath3 such as @xmath45 and 0.05 .",
    "they approach horizontal lines at some large values of @xmath2 .",
    "when @xmath3 is small such as @xmath44 , the graph becomes flat only for large @xmath2 , as shown in fig .",
    "5 .    from the flatness of the graphs of @xmath52 for large @xmath2",
    ", it follows that the power law behavior : @xmath70 does not hold when @xmath2 is very large . in fig .",
    "3 , we have discussed that the ratio @xmath63 versus the number @xmath2 can be approximated by the power law for @xmath44 through the range of @xmath61 .",
    "however , the power - law approximation should be valid only within some finite range of @xmath2 .",
    "let us discuss other finite-@xmath2 behaviors of the ratio @xmath52 .",
    "for the trefoil knot , the ratio @xmath63 is less than 1.0 when @xmath2 is small ; it approaches or becomes larger than 1.0 when @xmath2 is large enough .",
    "when cylinder radius @xmath3 is small such as @xmath71 and @xmath72 , the ratio @xmath63 is clearly greater than 1.0 when @xmath2 is large enough .",
    "when @xmath3 is small , there should be a critical value @xmath73 such that @xmath74 for @xmath75 , and @xmath76 for @xmath77 .",
    "furthermore , we have a conjecture that the critical value @xmath73 should be roughly equal to the characteristic length @xmath16 of random knotting .",
    "it seems that the conjecture is consistent with the graphs of fig .",
    "5 ( b ) .",
    "let us discuss the conjecture on @xmath73 , explicitly . in fig . 5 ( b ) , we see that for @xmath44 , the ratio @xmath63 becomes 1.0 roughly at @xmath78 , and also that for @xmath72 , the ratio @xmath63 is close to 1.0 roughly at @xmath79 .",
    "the observations are consistent with the estimates of @xmath16 in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath80 for @xmath81 and @xmath82 for @xmath72 .",
    "thus , the consistency supports the conjecture on @xmath73 .",
    "the effect of a topological constraint on the gyration radius decreases when the excluded volume increases .",
    "there are two examples : the decrease of ratio @xmath52 with respect to cylinder radius @xmath3 while @xmath2 being fixed , and the disappearance of the crossover for the trivial knot shown in figs . 3 and 4 .",
    "let us first discuss how the excluded - volume can modify the effective expansion due to the topological constraint . as we clearly see in fig .",
    "5 , the ratio @xmath7 decreases as cylinder radius @xmath3 increases with @xmath2 fixed , both for the trivial and trefoil knots .",
    "thus , the effective expansion of saps under the topological constraint becomes smaller when the excluded volume becomes larger .",
    "it is quite nontrivial that the effective expansion given by the ratio @xmath52 decreases as cylinder radius @xmath3 increases .",
    "in fact , the value of @xmath51 itself increases with respect to @xmath3 , as we have observed in fig .",
    "2 . furthermore",
    ", one might expect that the effective expansion due to a topological constraint should also increase with respect to cylinder radius @xmath3 , simply because the average size of ring polymers with larger excluded volume becomes larger , as observed in fig .",
    "1 . however , it is not the case for the ratio @xmath52 .",
    "let us now discuss the crossover behavior of the trivial knot again , from the viewpoint of the competition between the topological effect and the excluded volume effect .",
    "here we recall that the crossover has been discussed in ",
    "3.a with figs . 3 and 4 . here",
    "we regard the crossover as a characteristic behavior derived from the topological constraint of being the trivial knot .    as a working hypothesis ,",
    "let us assume that the crossover should occur at around the characteristic length @xmath16 . recall that @xmath16 is larger than 1000 for @xmath45 and 0.05 , as we have estimated : @xmath83 for @xmath45 , and @xmath84 for @xmath67 . if the above hypothesis would be valid , then the graphs for @xmath3 = 0.03 and 0.05 should also be convex . in fig .",
    "4 , however , we see no change in the gradient of the graph of @xmath53 versus @xmath2 for @xmath45 or 0.05",
    ". the assumed crossover of the trivial knot does not appear for @xmath3 = 0.03 or 0.05 .",
    "we may thus consider that the crossover as a topological effect is diminished by the excluded volume effect when @xmath85 .      in terms of the characteristic length @xmath16",
    ", we can explain some properties of the effective expansion of cylindrical saps under a topological constraint .",
    "here we recall that the ratio @xmath7 describes the degree of the effective expansion under the topological constraint of a knot @xmath1 .",
    "we first consider the case when the characteristic length @xmath16 is very large .",
    "let us show that the ratio @xmath53 should be close to 1.0 for @xmath86 .",
    "first , we recall that the probability @xmath87 of the trivial knot decays exponentially with respect to the number @xmath2 of polygonal nodes : @xmath88 .",
    "if @xmath89 is very small , the probability @xmath87 is close to 1.0 , i.e. , almost all saps have the trivial knot",
    ". then , the mean - squared gyration radius with no topological constraint @xmath6 should be almost equal to that of the trivial knot @xmath90 .",
    "consequently , the ratio @xmath53 should be close to 1.0 .",
    "when @xmath91 , the characteristic length @xmath16 is larger than @xmath92 .",
    "then , the trivial knot is dominant among the possible knots generated in saps with @xmath93 .",
    "thus , @xmath90 should almost agree with @xmath6 , which is the mean - squared gyration radius of saps under no topological constraint .",
    "there is no effective expansion under the topological constraint : the @xmath53 is close to 1.0 .",
    "let us next consider the case when the characteristic length @xmath16 is small or not large .",
    "then we show that the mean square radius of gyration of saps with the trivial knot @xmath90 should be larger than that of no topological constraint @xmath6 for @xmath59 .",
    "in fact , various types of knots can appear in a given set of randomly generated saps of the cylinder radius @xmath3 , since the probability of the trivial knot @xmath87 is exponentially small for @xmath59 .",
    "we note that the fraction of nontrivial knots is given by @xmath94 .",
    "thus , it is not certain whether the ratio @xmath53 is close to the value 1.0 or not .",
    "however , we may expect that the ratio @xmath53 should be indeed larger than 1.0 .",
    "here we consider the following points : when @xmath59 , the majority of saps generated randomly should have much more complex knots than the trivial knot ; the mean square radius of gyration of @xmath2-noded saps with a very complex knot should be much smaller than that of the trivial knot .",
    "the explanation on the effective expansion discussed in the above is completely consistent with the simulation results , as having been discussed in  3 , in particular , through figs . 3 , 4 and 5 .",
    "let us discuss an asymptotic expansion for the mean square radius of gyration of cylindrical saps with a given knot @xmath1 .",
    "here we assume that @xmath0 can be expanded in terms of @xmath96 consistently with renormalization group arguments .",

    "however , we have introduced @xmath98 as a fitting parameter .",
    "thus , for the ratio @xmath52 , we have the following expansion : @xmath100 \\ , .\\ ] ] here we have put @xmath101 as a fitting parameter .",
    "we have analyzed the data for the three different knots : the trivial , trefoil and @xmath49 knots , applying the expansion ( [ rg ] ) to the numerical data of @xmath7 for @xmath102 .",
    "the best estimates of the three parameters are given in tables 1 , 2 and 3 for the trivial , trefoil and @xmath49 knots , respectively .",
    "let us discuss the best estimates of the difference of the exponents : @xmath101 .",
    "we see in tables 1 , 2 and 3 that all the results of @xmath101 suggest that they should be given by 0.0 , with respect to the confidence interval .",
    "let us examine the best estimates more precisely .",
    "it is rather clear from tables 1 , 2 and 3 that for a given cylinder radius @xmath3 , the best estimates of @xmath101 are independent of the knot type .",
    "there is another evidence supporting that @xmath103 for the trivial and trefoil knots .",
    "let us consider the plots of the ratio @xmath52 versus @xmath2 in fig . 5 for the trivial and trefoil knots .",
    "we recall that the graphs are likely to approach some horizontal lines at some large @xmath2 .",
    "the tendency of the graphs becoming flat for large @xmath2 suggests that @xmath0 and @xmath6 should have the same exponent , i.e. , @xmath5 .    from the two observations ,",
    "we conclude that the difference of the exponents is given by 0.0 : @xmath104 for any value of @xmath3 .",
    "there is thus no topological effect on the scaling exponent defined in the asymptotic expansion of @xmath42 .",
    "let us now consider the amplitude @xmath106 of the asymptotic expansion ( [ rg ] ) .",
    "in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , the best estimates of the ratio @xmath105 are larger than 1.0 for the three knots , when @xmath3 is small",
    ". the observation must be important .",
    "in fact , if the amplitude ratio @xmath105 is larger than 1.0 in the asymptotic expansion ( [ rg ] ) , then @xmath42 is larger than @xmath6 for any large value of @xmath2 .",
    "it might seem that the consequence is against the standard thermodynamic limit of statistical mechanics .",
    "however , there is a clear evidence for the observation that @xmath107 for some small values of cylinder radius @xmath3 .",
    "in fact , the graphs of the ratio @xmath7 versus @xmath2 are monotonically increasing with respect to @xmath2 , as we see in figs . 3 , 4 and 5 .",
    "it is clear that the graphs with the smaller values of cylinder radius @xmath3 are larger than 1.0 when @xmath2 is large .",
    "this observations of figs .",
    "3 , 4 and 5 confirm that @xmath107 when cylinder radius @xmath3 is small .",
    "thus , we may conclude that the topological constraint gives an effective expansion also to asymptotically large cylindrical saps when the radius @xmath3 is small .",
    "the value of @xmath105 decreases with respect to the radius @xmath3 for the three knots .",
    "we see it in tables 1 to 3 , where the best estimates of @xmath105 are listed .",
    "it is also consistent with the fact that the ratio @xmath7 decreases with respect to @xmath3 , which we have discussed in  3.c .",
    "however , the decrease of @xmath105 is quite nontrivial , since the mean - squared gyration radius @xmath0 itself increases with respect to @xmath3 , for the trivial and trefoil knots , as shown in fig .",
    "we recall in fig .",
    "1 that the gyration radius under no topological constraint @xmath6 increases with respect to @xmath3 .    from the viewpoint of asymptotic behaviors",
    ", we have shown that the effective expansion derived from the topological repulsion decreases with respect to cylinder radius @xmath3 .",
    "we have also discussed that @xmath42 is larger than @xmath6 for any large value of @xmath2 , when cylinder radius @xmath3 is small .",
    "let us discuss the @xmath3 dependence of the amplitude ratio @xmath105 , more quantitatively .",

    "the estimates of @xmath110 versus @xmath3 are shown in fig . 6 in the double - logarithmic scale for the trivial , trefoil , and @xmath49 knots .",
    "to be precise , the values of @xmath110 are a little larger than those of @xmath105 given in tables 1 , 2 and 3 .",
    "the estimate of the parameter @xmath110 becomes close to the value 1.0 when cylinder radius @xmath3 is large enough .",
    "furthermore , it is suggested from fig . 6",
    "that @xmath110 should be independent of the knot type .",
    "in fact , the data points for the trivial , trefoil and the double - trefoil ( @xmath114 ) knots overlap each other . these two observations are consistent with the simulation result of the self - avoiding polygons on the lattice @xcite .",
    "interestingly , we see in fig . 6",
    "that the ratio @xmath110 decreases monotonically with respect to the cylinder radius @xmath3 . for the data with @xmath115 , we find that @xmath110 is roughly approximated by a decreasing function of @xmath3 such as @xmath116 , with @xmath117=1.00@xmath1180.12 , @xmath119=-0.05@xmath1180.02 and @xmath120=5.78@xmath1184.79 .",
    "the @xmath121 value is given by 1 .",
    "with some graphs in the @xmath8 plane , we can illustrate the finite - size behaviors of the ratio @xmath52 discussed in  3 .",
    "we recall that the topological effect has played a central role as well as the excluded - volume effect .",
    "thus , we consider two lengths with respect to the number @xmath2 of polygonal nodes : the characteristic length of random knotting @xmath16 and the `` excluded - volume length '' @xmath122 .",
    "when @xmath123 , the excluded - volume effect should be important to any @xmath2-noded sap with radius @xmath3 .",
    "we define @xmath122 by @xmath124 .",
    "the derivation is given in the following .",
    "we first note that the parameter @xmath125 of the excluded - volume is given by @xmath126 , where the cylindrical segments have the diameter @xmath127 and the length @xmath128 , and the second virial coefficient @xmath129 of a polymer chain is given by @xmath130 @xcite . here",
    "we also note that the ratio @xmath131 corresponds to the radius @xmath3 of the cylindrical saps",
    ". we may consider that when @xmath132 , the excluded volume can not be neglected .",
    "thus we have the number @xmath122 from the condition : @xmath133 .",
    "we consider two graphical lines in the @xmath8 plane : @xmath134 and @xmath135 . in fig .",
    "7 , the vertical line of the diagram expresses the @xmath3-axis and the horizontal one the @xmath2-axis .",
    "the graph @xmath136 reaches the @xmath2 axis at @xmath137 .",
    "here we recall that the function @xmath16 is given by eq .",
    "( [ ncr ] ) : @xmath138 .",
    "there is a crossing point for the two curved lines .",
    "the coordinates of the crossing point is approximately given by @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "for a given simulation of the ratio @xmath52 with a fixed radius @xmath3 , we have a series of data points located on a straight line parallel to the @xmath2 axis .",
    "let us first consider the case of small values of @xmath3 such as @xmath44 and @xmath72 . from the simulation of",
    " 3 , it is shown that the effective expansion due to the topological constraint is large .",
    "this is consistent with the following interpretation of the @xmath8 diagram : if we start from the region near the @xmath3 axis and move in the direction of the @xmath2 axis , then we cross the line @xmath141 before reaching another one @xmath142 ; thus , we expect that the excluded - volume remains small when the topological effect becomes significant",
    ".    the above explanation should be consistent with the observation that the crossover of the trivial knot occurs near @xmath135 for small values of @xmath3 .",
    "here we recall figs . 3 and 4 . when @xmath3 is very small",
    ", then we cross the line of @xmath143 almost at @xmath144 .",
    "when radius @xmath3 is large such as @xmath45 and 0.05 , it is shown in  3 through simulation that the effective expansion is small : the ratio @xmath7 is close to 1.0 . in the @xmath8 diagram ,",
    "when we move rightwards from the region near the @xmath3 axis with @xmath3 fixed , we cross the line @xmath142 before reaching another line @xmath143 .",
    "thus , the effective expansion as the topological effect should be small .",
    "finally , we should remark that some important properties of @xmath0 of cylindrical saps with radius @xmath3 have been discussed systematically through scaling arguments with the blob picture by grosberg @xcite . in the note @xcite , the characteristic length @xmath16 and the excluded - volume parameter @xmath125",
    "are explicitly discussed in the @xmath8 diagrams .",
    "it would thus be an interesting future problem to investigate how far the predicted properties of @xmath0 are consistent with simulation results ."
