    "bright matter - wave solitons @xcite provide an exceptional testbed for studying quantum mechanics above the single - atom level .",
    "for the observation of quantum phenomena , coherence is a crucial requirement , and matter - wave solitons , which propagate without dispersion , may render this observation more feasible .",
    "the generation of solitary waves in quasi - one - dimensional ( q1d ) attractive bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) @xcite may be regarded as a tuned equilibrium between the dispersive effects that tend to spread the atomic wave function , and the nonlinear attractive interactions which oppose the spreading by providing an effective self - focusing of the matter waves .",
    "the consequence of such an equilibrium is a stable mesoscopic atomic wave packet propagating without dispersion .",
    "repulsive condensates in q1d geometries can support matter - wave solitons of the gap type @xcite if they are loaded in an optical lattice ( ol ) , which gives rise to the bandgap structure , and are placed at the edge of the first brillouin zone , where there is a gap between the first and second bands @xcite . under these conditions",
    ", the soliton exhibits an effective _ negative mass _ , which permits to balance the dispersion and the nonlinear interactions , even if they are repulsive .",
    "various effects generated by the negative effective mass were considered in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "stability conditions for gap solitons ( gss ) impose severe restrictions on their interactions with a potential well or barrier corresponding to a local modification of the periodic structure .",
    "specifically , the requirement of the stability allows only for perfect transmission or perfect reflection , but not partial transmission and reflection that plane waves display @xcite . in other words ,",
    "gss can not split through the interaction with linear defects , and behave like particles exhibiting mesoscopic quantum features @xcite , including the quantum reflection of the entire soliton ",
    "an effect that has been also reported recently for matter - wave solitons in the self - attractive bec case @xcite .",
    "although quantum reflection of ultracold atoms from a solid surface has been reported too @xcite , the limit of the complete ( @xmath0 ) reflection , predicted for the solitons , is not achievable in that case .",
    "interactions of matter - wave solitons with nonlinear traps and barriers produced by spatial variations of the scattering length have also been recently addressed @xcite .    in this work",
    "we aim to explore such quantum features in the case of the interaction of a matter - wave soliton of the gap type with a double - barrier potential resembling a fabry - perot cavity .",
    "in particular , we demonstrate that it is possible to trap a soliton in the cavity formed by the two potential barriers ( a similar effect for optical solitons in fiber bragg gratings was predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the context of bec , the propagation through a double - barrier potential acting as a fabry - perot interferometer for matter - waves leads to bistability of the transmitted flux and resonant transport @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] , we formulate the physical model which includes the effective cavity for the gs . sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] is devoted to the study of the conditions for the trapping of the entire soliton in the cavity . in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] , the collision of a second gs with one trapped in the cavity is studied ( this interaction also bears some similarity of collisions between free and defect - trapped optical solitons in fiber gratings @xcite ) . the paper is concluded in sec .",
    "[ sec:5 ] .",
    "the dynamics of bright gss created in a q1d geometry at zero temperature may be accurately described by the one - dimensional ( 1d ) gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) : @xmath1 \\psi ,   \\label{gpe}\\]]where the effective nonlinearity is @xmath2 , with @xmath3 the @xmath4-wave scattering length and @xmath5 the transverse trapping frequency . the effective axial potential , @xmath6includes the parabolic trap with corresponding frequency @xmath7 and the ol with spatial period @xmath8 and depth @xmath9 .",
    "first , we briefly summarize the numerical procedure used to generate gss , as per ref .",
    "the ground state is found for a @xmath10rb condensate ( @xmath11 nm ) formed by @xmath12 atoms trapped magnetically with transverse and axial frequencies @xmath13 hz and @xmath14 hz , respectively , in the presence of an ol , with potential depth equal to the ol recoil energy , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the recoil momentum , and @xmath17 nm , the period",
    ". then , the axial magnetic trap is suddenly turned off and an appropriate phase imprinting leads to the inversion of the sign of the wave function at each second site . as a result , the system evolves toward a self - sustained staggered soliton with a negative effective mass .",
    "the soliton , which contains approximately @xmath18 of the initial number of atoms and extends over @xmath19 sites of the ol potential , is generated at rest with the center at @xmath20 . in order to set it into motion",
    ", we instantaneously impart an appropriate momentum to the soliton , to which it responds by self - adaptation to the new conditions , i.e. , expunging atoms until a new equilibrium state is reached .",
    "with momentum @xmath21 lent to the gs , it settles down into a state with @xmath22 of the initial number of atoms ( @xmath23 ) , total energy @xmath24 , and the kinetic energy of its motion @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "our aim is to study the interaction of the so generated moving matter - wave soliton with a fabry - perot type potential , formed by two potential barriers forming a cavity for the soliton , cf . a similar configuration proposed for optical solitons in fiber gratings @xcite . after turning off the magnetic trap , @xmath26 in eq .",
    "( [ gpe ] ) accounts only for the ol , which is locally modified around two sites , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , to generate the double - barrier structure as follows :    @xmath29    where @xmath30 reads : @xmath31with @xmath32 .",
    "below , we consider the symmetric cavity created by two identical barriers , with @xmath33 .",
    "note that , due to the negative effective mass of the gs , the barriers actually correspond to a local _ decrease _ of the periodic potential .",
    "points @xmath34 are fixed at local minima of the ol potential , and the distance between the barrier centers , @xmath35 , is assumed large enough to have the actual size of the cavity , @xmath36 , much larger than the axial size of the soliton .",
    "the interaction of a moving matter - wave gs with a single barrier in the ol was addressed recently in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown that the soliton does not split . for a fixed kinetic energy",
    ", there exists an abrupt transition from complete transmission to complete reflection , as the height of the barrier increases , for all considered values of the barrier widths .",
    "the border between these two outcomes of the collision of the soliton with the barrier is shown , in the plane of the barrier s parameters , height @xmath37 and width @xmath38 , by filled circles in fig .",
    "[ diagram ] .",
    "complete reflection and transmission occur , respectively , above and below this border ( i.e. , the white area in the figure corresponds to the bounce of the entire soliton from the barrier ) . in the process of the collision",
    ", the soliton naturally decreases its velocity ( even if does not bounce ) .",
    "this slowing down of the soliton in the region of the defect is more pronounced as we approach the border between the two behaviors .    .",
    "parameters @xmath38 ( measured in units of the lattice period , @xmath8 ) and @xmath37 , measured in units of the recoil energy , @xmath39 , are the width and height of the two barriers , respectively .",
    "the horizontal dotted line designates the kinetic energy of the moving soliton .",
    "]    addressing the configuration with the second barrier placed at a certain distance from the first one , we notice that the behavior of the incident soliton which hits the first barrier remains as described before , i.e. , a sudden transition from perfect transmission to perfect reflection occurs .",
    "nevertheless , when the height of the barriers is close to the transition point , and the length of the cavity ( @xmath40 ) is larger than the size of the soliton , the soliton which has passed the first barrier gets trapped in the cavity , in a state of oscillatory motion .",
    "thus , three scenarios are identified in the interaction of the incident soliton with the double - barrier structure : complete reflection , complete transmission , and trapping into the oscillatory state . as said above",
    ", the reflection occurs in the same area of the parameter space ( white region in fig .",
    "[ diagram ] ) as for the single barrier .",
    "the complete transmission takes place for values of the barrier s height and width well inside the transmission region for the single barrier ( the light grey area in fig .",
    "[ diagram ] ) , while the trapping is observed close to the transmission - reflection border for the single barrier ( the dark grey region in fig .",
    "[ diagram ] ) .",
    "the results shown in fig . [ diagram ] correspond to a fixed cavity size of @xmath41 and we have checked that the parameter space for trapping slightly increases with the size of the cavity . for a fixed width of the barriers , and a large enough distance between them , the three scenarios follow each other with the increase of the barriers height .",
    "these scenarios are illustrated , in fig .",
    "[ amplitude ] by spatiotemporal trajectories of the soliton hitting the cavity formed by two identical barriers of width @xmath42 , which are separated by distance @xmath43 , giving the cavity enough room to trap the soliton , @xmath44 .",
    "the complete transmission is displayed in panel ( a ) for @xmath45 , panel ( b ) with @xmath46 shows an example of the trapping , and the bounce ( complete reflection ) is observed in panel ( c ) , for @xmath47 .     and",
    "@xmath48 , each with width @xmath42 and the following height : ( a ) @xmath45 ; ( b ) @xmath46 ; ( c ) @xmath47 .",
    "here as well as in the following figures the horizontal dotted lines show the position of the centers of both barriers . ]",
    "figure [ amplitude](b ) clearly demonstrate that the trapped soliton performs periodic oscillations in the cavity without any visible loss of atoms .",
    "the period of the oscillations , for given parameters of the barriers , can be modified by changing the size of the cavity , as shown in fig .",
    "[ distance ] .",
    "note that the smallest period , limited by the condition that the size of the cavity must be larger than the soliton s axial size , is @xmath49  ms , in physical units .",
    "faster oscillations were predicted for a lattice soliton trapped in a potential well @xcite .     and height @xmath46",
    ". the first barrier is centered at @xmath50 , and the second at : ( a ) @xmath48 , ( b)@xmath51 , and ( c ) @xmath52 . ]",
    "it is relevant to note that , in the above - mentioned case of the trapping of optical solitons by a cavity in the model of the fiber grating @xcite , the maximum capture efficiency ( in terms of the soliton s energy ) is no more than @xmath53 , contrary to what happens with the matter - wave gss , which may be trapped _ entirely _ , without losses .",
    "and height @xmath46 are separated by distance @xmath43 , in ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) , or @xmath54 , in ( d ) and ( e ) .",
    "the second soliton is send after the first one with time delay @xmath55  ms ( a ) , @xmath56  ms ( b ) , @xmath57  ms ( c ) , @xmath58  ms ( d ) , and @xmath56  ms ( e ) . ]",
    "the next natural step in the analysis is to consider a collision between an incident soliton with the cavity already occupied by an ( identical ) earlier trapped gs .",
    "different outcomes of the collisions are observed , depending on time delay @xmath59 between the two solitons .",
    "figure [ two ] displays three cases for the cavity formed by two barriers of width @xmath42 and height @xmath46 , separated by a distance of @xmath43 , corresponding to ( a ) @xmath55  ms , ( b ) @xmath56  ms , and ( c ) @xmath57  ms . in ( a )",
    ", the incident soliton bounces back , while the trapped one performs oscillations in the cavity ; in ( b ) , the two solitons _ merge _ into a single one , and in ( c ) , the incident soliton bounces back , kicking out the trapped one in the forward direction .",
    "two more cases are shown in fig .",
    "[ two ] for the same parameters of the barriers , but for a different separation between them , @xmath54 , and time delays @xmath60  ms in ( d ) , and @xmath61  ms ( e ) . in this case",
    ", the cavity has enough room to trap the two solitons , which gives rise to new collision scenarios : in ( d ) , the incoming soliton gets trapped by kicking out the previously trapped one (  recharge \" ) , while in ( e ) _ both _ solitons get trapped in the cavity , oscillating in counter - phase .",
    "these sundry dynamical behaviors suggest new experimental possibilities for the control and manipulation of matter - wave gss .",
    "in this work , we have studied the interactions of bright matter - wave solitons of the gap type , with negative effective mass , which are supported by the interplay of the ol ( optical lattice ) and repulsive nonlinearity in bec , with a cavity formed by two far separated identical local potential barriers .",
    "we have shown that there exists a parameter region in which the incident soliton is trapped by the cavity into the shuttle state .",
    "this region can be found for all the values of the barriers width , provided that their height corresponds to the transmission of the soliton by a single barrier , but close to the reflection - transmission border .",
    "the interaction of a second soliton which hits the cavity already occupied by a trapped oscillating soliton has been considered too . in that case , a number of different collision scenarios can be identified , depending on the time delay between the launch of the two solitons .",
    "particularly interesting outcomes are the merging of the two solitons at the position of the first barrier , bounce of the second soliton kicking out the trapped one , the  recharge \" , i.e. , release of the originally trapped soliton which is replaced by the incident one , and trapping of both solitons into the state of shuttle oscillations in the cavity , with a phase shift of @xmath62 between them .",
