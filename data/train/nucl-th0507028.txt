    "a great deal of progress was recently achieved in our understanding of the multifragmentation phenomenon @xcite when an exact analytical solution of a simplified version of the statistical multifragmentation model ( smm ) @xcite was found in refs .",
    "an invention of a new powerful mathematical method @xcite , the laplace - fourier transform , allowed us not only to solve this version of smm analytically for finite volumes @xcite , but to find the surface partition and surface entropy of large clusters for a variety of statistical ensembles @xcite .",
    "it was shown @xcite that for finite volumes the analysis of the grand canonical partition ( gcp ) of the simplified smm is reduced to the analysis of the simple poles of the corresponding isobaric partition , obtained as a laplace - fourier transform of the gcp .",
    "this method opens a principally new possibility to study the nuclear liquid - gas phase transition directly from the partition of finite system and without taking its thermodynamic limit .",
    "exactly solvable models with phase transitions play a special role in the statistical physics - they are the benchmarks of our understanding of critical phenomena that occur in more complicated substances .",
    "they are our theoretical laboratories , where we can study the most fundamental problems of critical phenomena which can not be studied elsewhere .",
    "note that these questions _ in principle _ can not be clarified either within the widely used mean - filed approach or numerically .    despite this success ,",
    "the application of the exact solution @xcite to the description of experimental data is limited because this solution corresponds to an infinite system volume .",
    "therefore , from a practical point of view it is necessary to extend the formalism for finite volumes .",
    "such an extension is also necessary because , despite a general success in the understanding the nuclear multifragmentation , there is a lack of a systematic and rigorous theoretical approach to study the phase transition phenomena in finite systems .",
    "for instance , even the best formulation of the statistical mechanics and thermodynamics of finite systems by hill @xcite is not rigorous while discussing the phase transitions .",
    "exactly solvable models of phase transitions applied to finite systems may provide us with the first principle results unspoiled by the additional simplifying assumptions . here",
    "we present a finite volume extension of the smm .    to have a more realistic model for finite volumes",
    ", we would like to account for the finite size and geometrical shape of the largest fragments , when they are comparable with the system volume .",
    "for this we will abandon the arbitrary size of largest fragment and consider the constrained smm ( csmm ) in which the largest fragment size is explicitly related to the volume @xmath0 of the system .",
    "a similar model , but with the fixed size of the largest fragment , was recently analyzed in ref . @xcite .    in this work",
    "we will : solve the csmm analytically at finite volumes using a new powerful method ; consider how the first order phase transition develops from the singularities of the smm isobaric partition @xcite in thermodynamic limit ; study the finite volume analogs of phases ; and discuss the finite size effects for large fragments .",
    "the system states in the smm are specified by the multiplicity sets @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) of @xmath3-nucleon fragments .",
    "the partition function of a single fragment with @xmath3 nucleons is @xcite : @xmath4 , where @xmath5 ( @xmath6 is the total number of nucleons in the system ) , @xmath0 and @xmath7 are , respectively , the volume and the temperature of the system , @xmath8 is the nucleon mass .",
    "the first two factors on the right hand side ( r.h.s . ) of the single fragment partition originate from the non - relativistic thermal motion and the last factor , @xmath9 , represents the intrinsic partition function of the @xmath3-nucleon fragment .",
    "therefore , the function @xmath10 is a phase space density of the k - nucleon fragment . for ( nucleon )",
    "we take @xmath11 ( 4 internal spin - isospin states ) and for fragments with @xmath12 we use the expression motivated by the liquid drop model ( see details in @xmath13 with fragment free energy @xmath14k   + \\sigma ( t)~ k^{2/3}+ ( \\tau + 3/2 ) t\\ln k~ , % \\ ] ] with @xmath15 . here",

    "the calculation of @xmath32 is difficult due to the constraint @xmath33 .",
    "this difficulty can be partly avoided by evaluating the grand canonical partition ( gcp ) @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes a chemical potential .",
    "the calculation of @xmath36 is still rather difficult .",
    "the summation over @xmath1 sets in @xmath37 can not be performed analytically because of additional @xmath6-dependence in the free volume @xmath38 and the restriction @xmath39 .",
    "this problem was resolved @xcite by the laplace transformation method to the so - called isobaric ensemble @xcite .    in this work",
    "we would like to consider a more strict constraint @xmath40 , where the size of the largest fragment @xmath41 can not exceed the total volume of the system ( the parameter @xmath42 is introduced for convenience ) .",

    "a similar restriction should be also applied to the upper limit of the product in all partitions @xmath44 , @xmath32 and @xmath45 introduced above ( how to deal with the real values of @xmath46 , see later ) .",
    "then the model with this constraint , the csmm , can not be solved by the laplace transform method , because the volume integrals can not be evaluated due to a complicated functional @xmath0-dependence .",
    "however , the csmm can be solved analytically with the help of the following identity @xmath47 which is based on the fourier representation of the dirac @xmath48-function .",
    "the representation ( [ four ] ) allows us to decouple the additional volume dependence and reduce it to the exponential one , which can be dealt by the usual laplace transformation in the following sequence of steps @xmath49 \\theta(v^\\prime ) = \\nonumber \\\\ % % & & \\hspace*{-0.1cm}\\int_0^{\\infty}\\hspace*{-0.2cm}dv^{\\prime } % \\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty } d \\xi~ \\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty } %    \\frac{d \\eta}{{2 \\pi } } ~ { \\textstyle e^ { i \\eta ( v^\\prime - \\xi ) - \\lambda v^{\\prime }   % + v^\\prime { \\cal f}(\\xi , \\lambda - i \\eta ) } } \\ , .",

    "the isobaric partition ( [ seven ] ) of the csmm is , of course , more complicated than its smm analog @xcite because for finite volumes the structure of singularities in the csmm is much richer than in the smm , and they match in the limit @xmath57 only . to see this",

    "the real part of the free energy density , @xmath86 , defines the significance of the state s contribution to the partition : due to ( [ thirteen ] ) the largest contribution always comes from the gaseous state and has the smallest real part of free energy density . as usual , the states which do not have the smallest value of the ( real part of ) free energy , i. e. @xmath87 , are thermodynamically metastable . for infinite volume",
    "they should not contribute unless they are infinitesimally close to @xmath88 , but for finite volumes their contribution to the gcp may be important .    as one sees from ( [ eleven ] ) and",
    "( [ twelve ] ) , the states of different free energies have different values of the effective chemical potential @xmath89 , which is not the case for infinite volume @xcite , where there exists a single value for the effective chemical potential .",
    "thus , for finite @xmath0 the states which contribute to the gcp ( [ nine ] ) are not in a true chemical equilibrium .",
    "the meaning of the imaginary part of the free energy density becomes clear from ( [ eleven ] ) and ( [ twelve ] ) : as one can see from ( [ eleven ] ) the imaginary part @xmath90 effectively changes the number of degrees of freedom of each @xmath3-nucleon fragment ( @xmath91 ) contribution to the free energy density @xmath87 .",
    "it is clear , that the change of the effective number of degrees of freedom can occur virtually only and , if @xmath83 state is accompanied by some kind of equilibration process .",

    "this interpretation of @xmath94 naturally explains the thermodynamic metastability of all states except the gaseous one : the metastable states can exist in the system only virtually because of their finite decay / formation time , whereas the gaseous state is stable because it has an infinite decay / formation time .    ) for @xmath96 mev and @xmath97 .",

    "thus , we showed that the model with the fixed size of the largest fragment has no phase transition because there is a single singularity of the isobaric partition ( [ six ] ) , which exists in thermodynamic limit .",
    "if @xmath46 monotonically grows with the volume , the situation is different . in this case for positive value of @xmath134 the leading exponent in the r.h.s . of ( [ twelve ] ) also corresponds to a largest fragment , i.e. to @xmath135 .",

    "become stable because they acquire infinitely large decay / formation time @xmath94 in the limit @xmath57 . therefore , these states should be identified as a liquid phase for finite volumes as well .",
    "such a conclusion can be easily understood , if we recall that the partial pressure @xmath148 of ( [ meighteen ] ) corresponds to a single fragment of the largest possible size .",
    "now it is clear that each curve in fig .",

    ", the metastable states will never become stable .",
    "therefore , a systematic study of the volume dependence of free energy ( or pressure for very large @xmath0 ) along with the formation and decay times may be of a crucial importance for experimental studies of the nuclear liquid gas phase transition .",
    "the above results demonstrate that , in contrast to hill s expectations @xcite , the finite volume analog of the mixed phase does not consist just of two pure phases .",
    "the mixed phase for finite volumes consists of a stable gaseous phase and the set of metastable states which differ by the free energy .",

    "furthermore , according to eqs .",
    "( [ eleven ] ) and ( [ twelve ] ) , each of these states consists of the same fragments , but with different weights .",
    "as seen above for the case @xmath150 , some fragments that belong to the states , in which the largest fragment is dominant , may , in principle , have negative weights ( effective number of degrees of freedom ) in the expression for @xmath152 ( [ eleven ] ) .",
    "this can be understood easily because higher concentrations of large fragments can be achieved at the expense of the smaller fragments and is reflected in the corresponding change of the real part of the free energy @xmath153 .",

    "the real pole @xmath112 exists always and the quantity @xmath177 is the cgc pressure of the gaseous phase . the complex roots @xmath126 appear as pairs of complex conjugate solutions of equation ( [ ten ] ) .",
    "as we discussed , their most straightforward interpretation is as follows : @xmath178 has a meaning of the free energy density , whereas @xmath179 , depending on sign , gives the inverse decay / formation time of such a state .",
    "the gaseous state is always stable because its decay / formation time is infinite and because it has the smallest value of free energy .",
    "the complex poles describe the metastable states for @xmath180 and mechanically unstable states for @xmath181 .",
    "we studied the volume dependence of the simple poles and found a dramatic difference in their behavior in case of phase transition and without it . for the former",
    "this representation allows one also to define the finite volume analogs of phases unambiguously and to establish the finite volume analog of the @xmath149 phase diagram ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . at finite volumes",
    "the gaseous phase exists , if there is a single simple pole , the mixed phase corresponds to three and more simple poles , whereas the liquid is represented by an infinite amount of simple poles at highest possible particle density ( or @xmath95 ) .    as we showed",
    ", for given @xmath7 and @xmath35 the states of the mixed phase which have different @xmath182 are not in a true chemical equilibrium for finite volumes .",
    "this feature can not be obtained within the fisher droplet model due to lack of the hard core repulsion between fragments .",
    "this fact also demonstrates clearly that , in contrast to hill s expectations @xcite , the mixed phase is not just a composition of two states which are the pure phases .",
    "as we showed , the mixed phase is a superposition of three and more collective states , and each of them is characterized by its own value of @xmath183 . because of that the difference between the free energies of these states is not a surface - like , as hill argued @xcite , but volume - like .",
    "for the case with phase transition , i.e. for @xmath184 , we analyzed what happens in thermodynamic limit .",
    "when @xmath0 grows , the number of simple poles in ( [ eight ] ) also increases and imaginary part of the closest to the real @xmath59-axis poles becomes vanishing . for infinite volume",
    "the infinite number of simple poles moves toward the real @xmath59-axis and forms an essential singularity of function @xmath146 in ( [ seven ] ) , which defines the liquid phase singularity @xmath174 .",
    "thus , we showed how the phase transition develops in thermodynamic limit .",
    "also we analyzed the finite volume corrections to the mechanical pressure ( [ fifteen ] ) .",
    "the corrections of a similar kind should appear in the entropy , particle number and energy density because of the @xmath7 and @xmath35 dependence of @xmath163 due to ( [ ten ] ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , these corrections should be taking into account while analyzing the experimental yields of fragments .",
    "then the phase diagram of the nuclear liquid - gas phase transition can be recovered from the experiments on finite systems ( nuclei ) with more confidence .",
    "a detailed analysis of the isobaric partition singularities in the @xmath185 plane allowed us to define the finite volume analogs of phases and study the behavior of these singularities in the limit @xmath57 .",
    "such an analysis opens a possibility to study rigorously the nuclear liquid - gas phase transition directly from the finite volume partition .",
    "this may help to extract the phase diagram of the nuclear liquid - gas phase transition from the experiments on finite systems ( nuclei ) with more confidence .",
