    "a number of theoretical models have been proposed to describe nonlinear molecular excitations in dna double helix which plays an important role in the conservation and transformation of genetic information in biological systems @xcite .",
    "these theoretical models are based on longitudinal and transverse motions , as well as bending , stretching and rotations @xcite . among the different motions , the rotational motion of bases in dna",
    "is found to contribute more towards the opening of base pairs .",
    "the first contribution towards nonlinear dynamics of dna was made by englander and his co - workers @xcite who studied the dynamics of dna open states by taking into account only the rotational motion of nitrogenous bases , which made the main contribution towards the formation of open states .",
    "yomosa @xcite developing this idea further proposed a dynamic plane base rotator model which is a generalized version of the frenkel - kontrova @xcite model that was later improved by takeno and homma @xcite in which attention was paid to the degree of freedom , characterizing base rotations in the plane perpendicular to the helical axis around the backbone structure . in the above",
    ", the dna dynamics was governed by the completely integrable sine - gordon model admitting kink - type solitons .",
    "then peyrard and bishop @xcite studied the process of denaturation in which only the transverse motion of bases along the hydrogen bond was taken into account .",
    "there was one more model studied by christiansen and his colleagues ( see for e.g.@xcite ) using toda lattice model in which two types of internal motions namely , transverse motion along the hydrogen bond direction and longitudinal motion along the backbone direction were found to contribute to dna denaturation process in terms of travelling solitary waves and standing waves .",
    "these localized nonlinear excitations further explain conformation transition @xcite , long range interaction of kink solitons in the double chain @xcite , regulation of transcription @xcite , denaturation @xcite and charge transport in terms of polarons and bubbles @xcite .",
    "some of them have been successfully used for interpreting experimental data related to microwave absorption @xcite .",
    "further developments , in this approach for several years was limited to small improvements of the models involving only numerical methods of simulation of the internal dynamics of dna @xcite .",
    "also , bubbles @xcite discrete breathers @xcite and non - breathing compacton - like modes were obtained by solving the dna - lattice model @xcite .",
    "eventhough , the rotation of bases in dna is mainly due to thermal forces the thermal fluctuation in dna dynamics has been introduced through random forces in the recent past .",
    "for instance , yakushevich et al @xcite has shown that topological solitons of the dna chains are stable with respect to thermal oscillations .",
    "since random thermal forces introduce only small fluctuations , it is not included in the present study .",
    "thus , the study of nonlinear excitations in dna molecular chain has become an important task since it is related to its major functions .",
    "+ in all the above studies , dna double helix with homogeneous stiff strands has been considered for the analysis . however , in nature , the presence of different sites along the strands such as promotor , coding , terminator etc . each of which having a very specific sequence of bases and particular functions makes the strands site - dependent or inhomogeneous(soft ) .",
    "also , defects caused due to external molecules in the sequence and the presence of abasic site - like nonpolar mimic of thymine lead to inhomogeneity @xcite .",
    "when included , the dna dynamics is governed by an inhomogeneous perturbed sine - gordon equation and thus the problem boils down to solving the same and finding perturbed solitons . also , in a different context , in the recent times , the study of wave propagation , especially solitons through inhomogeneous or disordered media assumed lot of interest @xcite .",
    "for instance , kink - impurity interaction and its scattering in the sine - gordon model was studied in detail by zhang fei et al @xcite . with this in mind , in the present paper we study the nonlinear dynamics of dna double helix with inhomogeneous strands by considering a plane base rotator model along the lines of yomosa .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce a dynamic plane base rotator model for the site - dependent dna double helix and derive the nonlinear dynamical equation . in section 3 , we study the effect of inhomogeneity in stacking energy on the open state of dna in terms of kink - antikink solitons by solving a perturbed sine - gordon equation using a multiple scale soliton perturbation theory .",
    "the results are concluded in section 4 .",
    "detailed evaluation of few integrals using residue theorem is given in appendix .",
    "in fig.1a we have presented a schematic structure of the b - form dna double helix . here",
    "@xmath0 and @xmath1 represent the two complementary strands in the dna double helix .",
    "each arrow in the figure represents the direction of the base attached to the strand and the dots between arrows represent the net hydrogen bonding effect between the complement bases .",
    "while a horizontal projection of the @xmath2 base pair in the xy - plane is represented in fig.1b , in fig.1c , we have given the projection of the same in the xz - plane .",
    "the z - axis is chosen along the helical axis of the dna . in fig.1b , @xmath3 and",
    "@xmath4 denote the tip of the @xmath2 bases belonging to the complementary strands @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath5 and @xmath6 represent the points where the bases in the @xmath2 base pair are attached to the strands @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively .",
    "let @xmath7 and @xmath8 represent the angles of rotation of the bases in the @xmath2 base pair around the points @xmath5 and @xmath9 in the xz and xy - planes respectively .",
    "+    the conformation and stability of dna double helix is mainly determined by the stacking energy between the intrastrand adjacent bases , the hydrogen bonding energy between the interstrand complementary bases and other energies . from a heuristic argument",
    "it was assumed that the interstrand base - base interaction or hydrogen bonding energy of the given base pair depends on the distance between them .",
    "thus , from fig.1b we can write down the square of the distance between the edges of the arrows @xmath10 as @xmath11 + 2\\left[\\sin\\theta_n\\sin\\theta'_n \\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times\\left(\\cos\\phi_n\\cos\\phi'_n+\\sin\\phi_n\\sin\\phi'_n\\right ) \\left.-\\cos\\theta_n\\cos\\theta'_n\\right],\\label{eq1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where ` @xmath12 ' is the radius of the circle depicted in fig.1b .",
    "the base - base interaction energy can be understood in a more clear and transparent way by introducing quasi - spin operators @xmath13 and @xmath14 in the form +    @xmath15    for the @xmath2 bases in the @xmath16 and @xmath17 strands respectively . in view of this , eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) can be written in terms of the given spin operators as follows .",
    "@xmath18 -4r\\left[s_n^{x}+s_n^{'x}\\right].\\label{eq3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while writing eq.([eq3 ] ) we have neglected the longitudinal compression along the direction of the helical axis thereby choosing @xmath19 . it may be noted that the form of @xmath20 given in eq.([eq3 ] ) is the same as the hamiltonian for a generalized form of the heisenberg spin model .",
    "therefore , the intrastrand base - base interaction in dna can be written using the same consideration .",
    "it is known that stacking or base - base interaction is a dominant force that stabilizes the dna double helix .",
    "it is much stronger than the hydrogen bonding force and in fact the stacking between adjacent bases often contributes more than half of the total free energy of the base pairs @xcite .",
    "several non - covalent forces including dipole - dipole interaction , van der waals force etc stabilize stacking in dna .",
    "it is also reasonable to think that if such a quasi - spin model can be used in this problem , the double strand dna and the rung - like base pairs can be conceived as an anisotropic coupled spin chain model or spin ladder .",
    "this is schematically presented in fig.2 . in the figure , @xmath0 and @xmath1 which previously represented two strands of the dna here correspond to two ferromagnetic lattices of a spin ladder with antiferromagnetic coupling among the rungs . in the case of spin chains each arrow represents the magnetic moment corresponding to a group of atoms at that lattice point .",
    "due to antiferromagnetic type of rung coupling the arrows in the lattice @xmath0 and @xmath1 are marked anti - parallel to each other . here z - direction ( i.e ) the direction of the helical axis is chosen as the easy axis of magnetization in the spin chain .",
    "further , the spin - spin exchange interaction is restricted . to the nearest neighbours , ( i.e )",
    "the @xmath2 spin is coupled to the spins at the @xmath21 and @xmath22 sites .",
    "+ with this consideration we use the following heisenberg model of the hamiltonian for an anisotropic coupled spin chain model or spin ladder with site - dependent or inhomogeneous ferromagnetic - type exchange interaction between nearest neighbouring spins in the same lattice ( equivalent to coupling among bases in the same strand i.e. intrastrand interaction ) and antiferromagnetic rung - coupling ( between bases belonging to the complementary strands i.e. interstrand interaction ) .",
    "\\label{eq4 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above hamiltonian @xmath24 and @xmath25 correspond to the intrastrand interaction constant or the stacking energy between the @xmath2 base and its nearest neighbours in the plane normal to the helical axis in the strands @xmath0 and @xmath26 respectively . when k and @xmath27 are not equal to j and @xmath28 respectively , they introduce anisotropy in the intrastrand interaction . @xmath29 and @xmath30 represent a measure of interstrand interaction or hydrogen bonding energy between the bases of similar sites in both the strands along the direction of the helical axis and in a plane normal to it respectively . here",
    "we have assumed that there exist on an average almost uniform interactions @xmath31 and @xmath32 that assume positive values which are the uniaxial anisotropy coefficients leading to rotation of the bases in a plane normal to the helical axis .",
    "the quantities @xmath33 and @xmath34 in hamiltonian  ( [ eq4 ] ) indicate that the intrastrand stacking energy between bases in the @xmath16 and @xmath17 strand varies in a specified site dependent fashion which leads to inhomogeneity in the dna double helical chain . in general @xmath35 and",
    "@xmath34 may take different values for different base sequences .",
    "the inhomogeneity in dna double helix may arise due to any one of the reasons mentioned in the previous section .",
    "the effect of inhomogeneity in dna nonlinear dynamics has been studied in the past by several authors in various contexts such as variational mass density of bases @xcite and defect @xcite .",

    "@xmath38 in eq.([eq6 ] ) the overdot represents time derivative . when the anisotropy energies @xmath39 and @xmath40 are much larger than the other interactions , ( i.e ) when @xmath41 , then the equations of motion  ( [ eq6 ] ) on substituting the hamiltonian  ( [ eq5 ] ) become @xmath42 the other two equations in ( [ eq6 ] ) satisfy identically . using eq .",

    "\\label{eq9 }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it may be noted that the above limit corresponds to the xy - spin model of two coupled inhomogeneous ferromagnetic spin system . in hamiltonian ( [ eq9 ] )",
    "the first two terms represent the kinetic energies of the rotational motion of the @xmath2 nucleotide bases accompanied by the potential energy associated with the @xmath2 nucleotide sugar and phosphate and its complementary unit around the axes at @xmath5 and @xmath9 ( see fig.1b ) . @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the moments of inertia of the nucleotides around the axes at @xmath5 and @xmath9 respectively .",
    "it may be further noted that in the new hamiltonian the term proportional to @xmath29 vanishes .",

    "+ it is expected that in the b - form of dna double helix the difference in the angular rotation of bases with respect to neighbouring bases along the two strands is small @xcite .",
    "hence we assume that @xmath51 and @xmath52 in eqs.([eq10a ] ,  b ) . also , as the length of the dna chain is very large involving several thousands of base pairs compared to the distance between the neighbouring bases along the strands we make a continuum approximation as done by several authors in the past @xcite which is valid in the long wavelength , low temperature limit by introducing two fields of rotational angles , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and two inhomogeneous stacking fields , @xmath55 and @xmath56 along with the following expansions .",

    "in this paper , we studied the nonlinear dynamics of dna double helix with stacking inhomogeneity by considering the dynamic plane - base rotator model .",
    "the dynamical equation which finally appeared in the form of a perturbed sine - gordon equation was derived from a suitable hamiltonian in analogy with heisenberg model of an inhomogeneous anisotropic coupled spin chain or spin ladder with ferromagnetic legs and antiferromagnetic rung coupling in the continuum limit . in the unperturbed limit which is also the homogeneous limit , the dynamics is governed by the kink - antikink soliton of the integrable sine - gordon equation which represents the open state configuration of base pairs in dna double helix . even though dna double helix is a large molecular chain involving very large number of base pairs , base pair opening is limited to a very few number of base pairs forming localized coherent structure in the form of kink - antikink solitons which is obtained as a balance between dispersion and nonlinearity traveling with constant speed and amplitude without loosing its energy along the helical chain . to understand the effect of stacking energy inhomogeneity on the open state configuration of base pairs we carried out a multiple scale soliton perturbation analysis . for implementing this",
    "we linearized the perturbed sine - gordon equation using multiple - scale expansion to obtain linearized equations in the form of eigen value problems .",
    "the perturbed kink - antikink soliton solutions were constructed for different forms of inhomogeneities by solving the associated eigen value problem . by using the complete set of eigen functions",
    "thus obtained as the basis functions the perturbed solutions were constructed . + the perturbation not only modifies the shape of the soliton but also undergoes a slow time change of the soliton parameters namely the width and velocity for the different forms of the inhomogeneity chosen .",
    "we chose the inhomogeneity in the form of localized and periodic functions .",
    "the results show that when the inhomogeneity is either in the form @xmath269 or @xmath273 , the width of the soliton remains constant .",
    "thus , the number of base pairs participating in the opening do not change due to the above pattern of inhomogeneities .",
    "however , in this case the speed of the soliton increases with a correction that is proportional to the square of the initial width of the soliton and inversely proportional to its initial velocity . thus the inhomogeneity increases the speed with which the base pairs are opening and closing or winding and unwinding . from the perturbed solutions corresponding to different inhomogeneities ( see figs .",
    "4,5 ) we observe that the perturbation due to inhomogeneity in stacking energy along the strands introduces fluctuation only in the width of the solitons .",
    "the nature of the fluctuation varies depending on the type of inhomogeneity .",
    "in particular , when the inhomogeneity is in the form of @xmath269 , we find that fluctuation in the form of pulse trains resembling the shape of the inhomogeneity is generated in the width of the soliton representing open state configuration .",
    "it is noted that in the long time limit , eventhough neighbouring pulses overlap the train of pulse - like fluctuations maintain their character without affecting the soliton . in a similar way",
    ", when the inhomogeneity is of the form @xmath273 , the fluctuation appears in the form of periodic oscillations in the width of the soliton . in all these cases ,",
    "asymptotically the kink - antikink soliton shape is preserved .",
    "the results indicate that inhomogeneity in stacking energy in dna double helix can ( i ) introduce small fluctuations which may merge asymptotically during the process of opening and closing of base pairs ( ii ) increase or decrease the number of base pairs participating in the open state configuration and ( iii ) change the speed with which the open state configuration can travel along the double helical chain .",
    "thus in conclusion the inhomogeneity in stacking does not affect the general pattern of base pair opening . even though the size of the base pair is big and",
    "the solvent effect on pure rotation of base pairs is negligible , the soliton , a coherent structure which is formed by involving few base pairs move along the helical chain without dissipation or any other form of deformation .",
    "similar conclusion was also arrived in the case of propagation of soliton representing base pair opening in a discrete site - dependent dna @xcite and propagation of bubble in a heterogeneous dna chain @xcite . as nature selects generally inhomogeneous dna , the functions such as replication and transcription",
    "can be explained more viably through formation of open states through our inhomogeneous model rather than the homogeneous case .",
    "this is also because , it is known that transcription and replication are sequence dependent .",
    "this is further similar to what was observed in the case of proteins where inhomogeneity of the sequence leads to inhomogeneous fluctuations , enhanced by the nonlinear effect @xcite .",
    "eventhough the relevance of these effects in the dna to biological processes are not yet clearly , established a recent study suggests that thermally induced base pair opening agrees with experimental observation on dna base pair opening detected by potassium permanganate foot printing @xcite .",
    "we will make numerical analysis of the discrete dynamical equation separately to understand the discreteness effect which will be published elsewhere .",
