    "self - assembled monolayers ( sams ) of organothiolates on metal surfaces are studied for a wide range of technological applications running from catalysis , biosensors to microelectronic devices @xcite . in organic light - emitting diodes ,",
    "the interfaces between the metal contacts and the organic material are critical in the device performance , since they control the injection of electrons and holes into the device @xcite .",
    "chemisorption of a sam on a metal surface can alter its work function substantially . depending on the sam",
    ", the work function can be manipulated advantageously to lower the energy barrier for electron and hole injection @xcite .",
    "self - assembled monolayers have also become attractive for fundamental studies in metal  organic interfaces and molecular electronics .",
    "they represent stable and ordered structures , which can be prepared experimentally in air , in solution , or in vacuum @xcite .",
    "sams of alkanethiolates , c@xmath1h@xmath2s , on au(111 ) are among the most extensively studied systems .",
    "alkanethiolate sams on au(111 ) adopt a structure or superstructures thereof @xcite .",
    "alkanethiolates form sams on a wide range of ( noble ) metal surfaces , which have a similar structure as on au(111 ) .",
    "variations on the packing density are possible , however , and on ag(111 ) a somewhat denser packed structure has been reported @xcite .",
    "the change in work function of the surface upon adsorption of the sam is directly proportional to the dipole moment density generated at the sam  metal interface . for sams on au(111 )",
    "it has been shown that this dipole moment density is mainly determined by the permanent dipoles in the thiolate molecular layer .",
    "the sulfur ",
    "gold bonds that are formed upon adsorption , are nearly apolar and give a very small contribution to the interface dipole @xcite",
    ". however , a small sulfur  metal bond dipole is typical of gold and the existence of a much larger bond dipole is indicated by experiments of alkanethiolate sams on silver @xcite . in a previous computational study on model structures",
    "we have shown that large bond dipoles can be formed in the adsorption of sams on ag and pt surfaces @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the interface dipole formation resulting from adsorption of sams on ag(111 ) by first - principles density functional theory ( dft ) calculations .",
    "in particular we examine the influence of the structure and the packing density of the molecules in the sam .",
    "the packing , which is observed experimentally for alkanethiolate sams on ag(111 ) @xcite , is our starting point .",
    "we consider several low energy structures @xcite .",
    "the results are compared to the structure , where the surface area per adsorbed molecule is 29% larger , which is the most common structure of alkanethiolate sams on other noble metal ( 111 ) surfaces .",
    "we also consider the less densely packed structure , which has a 71% higher surface area per molecule . fluorinated alkanethiolate sams on au(111 ) can be observed in this structure @xcite , and it might be possible that this structure is also formed by such molecules adsorbed on ag(111 ) .",
    "we show that although the interface dipole density is smaller for less densily packed structures , it is not simply proportional to the packing density due to dielectric screening in the molecular layer .",
    "the commonly used dft functionals describe the formation of chemical bonds and the resulting charge distribution very well , but they fail to capture the van der waals interactions between the alkyl chains .",
    "van der waals interactions are relatively unimportant in short chain alkanethiolates , which is why we focus on the short chain thiolates ch@xmath3s and c@xmath4h@xmath5s . to elucidate the influence of the polarity of the molecules on the sam@xmath6metal interface dipole",
    ", we also study the fluorinated thiolates cf@xmath3s and cf@xmath3ch@xmath4s .",
    "since the directions of the dipole moment of fluorinated and of nonfluorinated thiolates are roughly opposite , this leads to an obvious difference in the interface dipole between sams of the two types of molecules .",
    "in addition , fluorinated thiolates have a much higher electronegativity .",
    "one would expect that by varying the relative electronegativity of the surface and the molecules , one can modify the electron transfer between surface and molecules , which would give an additional contribution to the interface dipole .",
    "in this paper we will show that increasing the electronegativity by fluorinating the alkyl tails does however not lead to a change in charge transfer .",
    "we will arrive at this conclusion by analyzing the interface dipole and separating it into a contribution from the molecular dipoles and from the charge reordering at the metal@xmath6sam interface . by comparing these results to those obtained for sam@xmath6au(111 ) and",
    "sam@xmath6pt(111 ) interfaces , it can be concluded that the charge transfer depends on the metal surface and the nature of the sulfur@xmath6metal bond , but not on the molecular tails .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe the techniques we use for calculating and analyzing the interface dipoles and give details on the parameters used in the calculations . subsequently the results on the sam@xmath6ag(111 ) interfaces are discussed .",
    "first we discuss the possible structures and then we analyze the interface dipoles .",
    "the last section contains a short summary and the conclusions .",
    "the ag(111 ) metal surface is represented by a slab of layers of metal atoms stacked according to an _ fcc _ abc sequence .",
    "a typical slab consists of four layers .",
    "the sam is adsorbed on one side of the slab .",
    "the surface unit cell depends upon the monolayer structure and coverage .",
    "the cells used in our calculations are , , and , which contain 7 , 3 and 4 metal atoms per layer , respectively .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are applied in all three directions .",
    "this means that not only are the cells repeated along the surface ( the @xmath7-plane ) , but also the slabs are repeated in the @xmath8-direction .",
    "the atoms in neighboring cells are separated along the @xmath8-direction by a vacuum region of @xmath9  . to cancel the artificial interaction between the dipoles of the repeated slabs ,",
    "the neugebauer - scheffler dipole correction is applied @xcite .",
    "the electronic structure is treated within density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite using the pw91 functional @xcite to describe the electronic exchange and correlation .",
    "the calculations are performed with the program vasp ( vienna _ ab initio _ simulation package ) @xcite using the projector augmented wave ( paw ) method @xcite . for noble metal atoms the outer shell",
    "s and d electrons are treated as valence electrons , and for first and second row elements the outer shell s and p electrons .",
    "the valence pseudo wave functions are expanded in a basis set consisting of plane waves .",
    "all plane waves up to a kinetic energy cutoff of 500 ev are included .",
    "the geometries are optimized by allowing the atoms in the top two metal layers and the atoms in the sams to relax .",
    "the @xmath10 surface unit cell parameter is fixed at its optimized bulk value of 2.93  .",
    "the calculations use a @xmath11-point sampling mesh of @xmath12 for the @xmath13 structure , @xmath14 for the @xmath15 and @xmath16 for the @xmath17 structures , according to the monkhorst - pack scheme . for geometry optimization",
    "a methfessel - paxton smearing is used with a broadening parameter of 0.2 ev @xcite .",
    "the energies of the optimized geometries are recalculated using the tetrahedron scheme @xcite .",
    "tests regarding the slab thickness , vacuum thickness , @xmath11-point sampling grid , and plane wave kinetic energy cutoff are performed , from which we estimate that total energy differences are converged to within @xmath18 ev .",
    "the adsorption energy of the sam is calculated by comparing the total energy of the slab ( with the adsorbed sam ) , with that of the clean slab ( with the top surface in its relaxed ag(111 ) structure ) , and the free alkanethiolate ( radical ) molecules .",
    "if sam adsorption results in a reconstruction of the surface that involves metal adatoms @xcite , we assume that these adatoms are supplied by the bulk metal .",
    "the adsorption energy per molecule @xmath19 associated with a surface structure that contains @xmath20 molecules , @xmath21 metal atoms per layer and @xmath22 adatoms is then given by @xmath23 - e_\\mathrm{mol } , \\label{eq : abs}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the total energy of the slab , @xmath25 is the total energy of the clean slab per surface atom ( top surface in optimized ag(111 ) structure ) , @xmath26 is the total energy of bulk ag per atom , and @xmath27 is the total energy of an alkanethiolate molecule .",
    "note that @xmath19 is negative if the adsorption is exothermic .    to analyze the results we have also calculated several properties of isolated thiolate molecules : dipole moments , ionization potentials , electron affinities and electronegativities . for these calculations",
    "we use the gamess program @xcite , and treat the electronic structure within dft using the b3lyp functional @xcite .",
    "we use the aug - cc - pvtz basis set .",
    "calculations with the smaller 6 - 311 g * * basis set give dipole moments that are up to @xmath28 d smaller , and ionization potentials , electron affinities that differ by @xmath29 ev .      interface dipoles can be extracted from the change in the surface work function upon adsorption of a sam on a metal surface , as will be described below .",
    "surface work functions are evaluated from the expression : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the electrostatic potential in vacuum and @xmath32 is the fermi energy of the bulk metal .",
    "@xmath31 is extracted by calculating the average electrostatic potential in the @xmath7-planes of the slab : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the area of the surface unit cell and @xmath35 is the total electrostatic potential .",
    "the latter is generated on an equidistant real space grid and the integral is obtained by straighforward numerical integration . in practice @xmath36 reaches an asymtotic value @xmath31 within a distance of @xmath37 from the surface into the vacuum .",

    "@xmath38 is the work function of the clean ag surface and @xmath39 is the work function of surface covered by the sam .",
    "slab calculations produce a reasonable value for the bulk fermi energy @xmath32 , but a more accurate value is obtained from a separate bulk calculation .",
    "we follow the procedure described by fall _",
    "_ @xcite . from the convergence tests discussed in the previous section we estimate that calculated work functions are converged to within @xmath18 ev .",
    "typically , dft / pw91 calculations give work functions that are within 0.1 - 0.2 ev of the experimental values , although occasionally larger deviations of @xmath40 ev can be found @xcite .     of a slab consisting of four layers of silver atoms and one layer of cf@xmath3s molecules on top .",
    "the @xmath8 axis is normal to the ( 111 ) surface . ]    upon adsorption of a sam the work function of a metal surface usually changes considerably .",
    "the work function change @xmath41 can be interpreted in terms of a change in the surface dipole @xmath42 : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the surface area per adsorbed molecule @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath42 corresponds to the component of the dipole moment directed along the surface normal , since only this component affects the work function .",
    "@xmath42 is the result of the interface formation between the sam and the metal surface , and we call it the _ interface dipole _ in the following .",
    "we split the interface dipole into a contribution @xmath45 from the molecular dipoles in the sam , and a contribution @xmath46 from the charge transfer between the metal surface and the molecule , which occurs upon chemisorption of the sam .",
    "the latter contribution is then defined by : @xmath47 @xmath45 is obtained from a separate calculation on a free - standing sam without the presence of a metal slab , but with the molecules frozen in their adsorbed geometry . in the following",
    "we will show that @xmath46 is nearly independent of the ( fluorinated ) alkyl tail of the thiolate molecule .",
    "this means that @xmath46 is mainly determined by the sulfur - metal bond and the charge transfer associated with this bond .",
    "note that the calculation of @xmath45 is done for a full monolayer . in practice @xmath45",
    "is obtained from the expression : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the potential drop over the sam , and @xmath50 are the asymptotic electrostatic potentials on both sides of the sam .",
    "these are easily obtained , since the potential reaches its asymptotic values within a distance of few  of the sam .",
    "this calculation incorporates the effect of the depolarizing electric field within the sam that is generated by the close - packed molecular dipoles .",
    "often this effect is modeled phenomenologically by introducing an effective dielectric constant @xmath51 for the sam : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the @xmath8-component of the permanent dipole of the isolated molecule . by obtaining @xmath53 from a separate calculation",
    "we will extract the effective dielectric constant as a function of the packing density of the molecules in the sam .",
    "we will first discuss the possible structures of thiolate sams on the ag(111 ) surface and then study the influence of the packing density on the work function .      from early scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) experiments it was concluded that sams of alkanethiolates on the ag(111 ) surface form a commensurate structure @xcite .",
    "normal incident x - ray standing wave ( nixsw ) experiments have confirmed the structure , but have corrected the registry of the sam on the underlying substrate to @xcite .",
