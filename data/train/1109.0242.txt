    "physical systems are never perfectly isolated from their environment . especially in quantum mechanics , when they are exploited to perform quantum computation or communication protocols , the interaction of the systems of interest with the environment should be considered in the derivation of the dynamical equations .",
    "effects of this interaction , e.g. decoherence and disentanglement , can indeed endanger the accomplishment of any task based on quantum features like coherence or entanglement .    in order to take into account the presence of the environment and its influence on the dynamics of the system , within the theory of open quantum systems  @xcite a variety of techniques",
    "have been developed to describe the evolution of the system of interest , e.g.  by quantum master equations .",
    "the functional form of any master equation depends both on the system and environment , and on the specific features and strength of the interaction . in the literature",
    "the dynamics of open quantum systems are often described using master equations in the so - called lindblad form  @xcite .",
    "profitable applications of this class of dynamical equations are present in many fields of physics , and systems whose dynamics is described by equations in the lindblad form are generally called markovian . as it will be explained in more detail in sec .",
    "ii , the dynamical maps associated with lindblad master equations are divisible , implying that during the evolution any pair of initially different states becomes less and less distinguishable .",
    "this phenomenon is interpreted as an irreversible loss of information which flows from the system to the environment , and it is considered to be the key feature of markovianity  @xcite .    in practice , however , lindblad master equations are derived under a series of approximations .",
    "the exact dynamics of any physical system is generally described by other classes of master equations .",
    "recently , a lot of effort has been devoted to provide a formal definition of non - markovianity in open quantum systems , e.g.  to capture physical features such as the re - coherence due to reservoir memory effects  @xcite .",
    "these efforts  @xcite also lead to computable measures for the degree of non - markovianity . in this paper , we focus on the definition given in ref .",
    "@xcite where non - markovianity is defined in terms of the information flow between the open system and its environment .    besides its own importance from a purely theoretical point of view",
    ", the concept of non - markovianity and its quantification may also find practical applications .",
    "one may ask indeed , whether non - markovianity can be considered as a resource to improve quantum technologies . more specifically , assuming that the density of modes of the reservoir may be engineered in a controlled way to induce non - markovian behavior , can this be used to improve existing quantum protocols ?",
    "the first affirmative answers come from quantum metrology and quantum key distributon . in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors investigate the problem of parameter estimation when the quantum channel is non - markovian according to the definition given in ref .",
    "they find that , for some non - markovian reservoirs , the estimation can be improved compared to the markovian case .",
    "the other example is reported in ref .",
    "@xcite where it has been proven that quantum key distribution protocols in non - markovian channels provide alternative ways of protecting the communication which can not be implemented in usual markovian channels .    even if the definition introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite is independent of the nature of the physical system , it has been applied so far to the discrete variable case only . in this paper",
    "we extend the analysis to continuous variable ( cv ) systems  @xcite which , in quantum information and communication , represent a valid , and sometimes better , alternative to discrete variable systems .",
    "our aim is to introduce and study a computable measure for the degree of non - markovianity in continuous variable systems focussing on some relevant examples of gaussian preserving maps .",
    "moreover we also consider the possibility of evaluating the map only for subsets of gaussian states ( e.g. coherent states and squeezed states ) with the main intent to provide a characterization of the map for protocols relying only on those specific classes of states .",
    "this approach paves the way to a definition of non - markovianity as a resource in quantum information theory .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we review the non - markovianity measure we use and extend the definition to the realm of continuous variable gaussian states . in sec .",
    "iii we focus on a phenomenological master equation describing a damping channel and evaluate its non - markovianity , whereas in sec .",
    "iv we address the same issue for quantum brownian motion in the weak coupling limit . finally in sec .",
    "v we discuss the results and close the paper with some concluding remarks .",
    "the measure for the degree of non - markovianity of a quantum process introduced in  @xcite is based on the distinguishability of two different initial quantum states @xmath0 and @xmath1 under the action of the open system dynamical map @xmath2 associated to the process .",
    "the distinguishability is qualified and quantified in  @xcite through the introduction of a proper distance measure between quantum states , the trace distance defined as @xmath3 .",
    "the trace distance satisfies a contractivity property under the action of any completely positive ( cpt ) map @xmath4 @xmath5 given a dynamical map @xmath6 , this is called divisible if the evolution up to a time @xmath7 can be written as a completely positive evolution from the initial time @xmath8 to an intermediate time @xmath9 , and another completely positive evolution from the intermediate time to the final time @xmath7 , i.e. @xmath10 , for any @xmath11 .",
    "lindblad dynamical semigroups @xcite describe divisible processes .",
    "it follows that under such dynamics the trace distance is always monotonic , i.e. @xmath12 for any pair @xmath13 , @xmath14 of initial states and for any @xmath15 .",
    "the monotonic decrease however holds also for classes of divisible maps which are not of a lindblad form ( examples are given in  @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the most dynamical evolutions violate both the divisibility condition and the monotonicity property of the trace distance .",
    "when monotonicity is not satisfied it means that there are intervals of time for which the states become more distinguishable compared to previous instants .",
    "this feature is interpreted as a flow of information from the environment back to the system , a striking property which characterizes a non - markovian evolution .",
    "the measure of the degree of non - markovianity is then defined as @xmath16 where @xmath17 indicates the time derivative and the maximization is taken over all the possible pairs of initial states .",
    "so far the quantity in has been evaluated and analyzed in some details for discrete variables quantum maps , e.g. a one qubit channel  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we extend it to continuous variable systems , focusing to single - mode systems .",
    "the extension involves two main issues requiring specific attention .",
    "the first comes from the fact that the hilbert space for continuous variable systems is infinite dimensional , and therefore it is not possible to characterize all the states with a finite number of parameters as in the qubit case ( e.g. bloch sphere representation ) .",
    "the second issue is related to the lack of an analytic expression for the trace distance or other , equivalent , distance measures for a generic cv state . on the other hand ,",
    "these issues may be solved upon restricting the analysis to gaussian states , and gaussian preserving channels  @xcite .",
    "in fact , gaussian states can be uniquely characterized by a finite number of parameters . moreover , since analytic expressions for the trace distance are lacking , alternative distinguishability signatures may be employed within the same spirit .",
    "one possible choice is to use the fidelity @xmath18 which is related to a proper distance measure , the bures distance @xmath19 .",
    "remarkably , the fidelity , and , thus , also the bures distance , are monotonic under the action of any cpt map , making it a good candidate for taking the role of the trace distance in the definition of the non - markovian measure .",
    "an alternative choice we could consider is the relative entropy @xmath20 $ ] whose expression for gaussian states is known @xcite . despite the fact that also the relative entropy possesses a contractivity property under cpt maps , it is not a proper distance measure ( e.g. it lacks symmetry property ) , and also it is not bounded . for these reasons",
    "we base our study on the fidelity .",
    "the most general single - mode gaussian state can be written as @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 $ ] and @xmath23 $ ] are the squeezing operator and the displacement operator , respectively , and @xmath24 is a thermal equilibrium state with @xmath25 average number of quanta , @xmath26 being the annihilation operator . upon introducing the vector operator @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the so - called quadrature operators , we can fully characterize @xmath30 by means of the first moment vector @xmath31,\\im{\\rm m}[\\beta])\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath32 $ ] , and of the @xmath33 covariance matrix ( cm ) @xmath34 , with elements @xmath35_{hk}=\\frac12\\langle r_hr_k + r_kr_h \\rangle - \\langle r_h\\rangle\\langle r_k \\rangle \\quad k=1,2\\,.\\ ] ]    the expression of the fidelity for a generic pair of gaussian states @xmath36 , @xmath37 can be given in a closed analytical form @xcite and , as expected , depends only on the values of the vectors @xmath38 , and covariance matrices @xmath39 of the states involved @xmath40 where @xmath41\\left[\\hbox{det } ( \\bmsigma_2)-\\frac14\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the fidelity in eq .",
    "is a function of all the parameters that characterize the pair of gaussian states : two complex displacement amplitudes @xmath42 , two complex squeezing amplitudes @xmath43 and two real thermal parameters @xmath44 . in order to simplify the notation used in the following",
    "we introduce here a set of collective arguments @xmath45 and denote , e.g. by @xmath46 the fidelity between two mixed coherent states at time @xmath7 of the evolution .",
    "the full set of parameters is denoted by the symbol @xmath47 .",
    "a non - markovianity measure may be obtained by integrating the time derivative of the fidelity @xmath48 over the intervals in which it decreases .",
    "if the class of initial states is characterized by the set of parameters @xmath47 the measure may be written as @xmath49,\\ ] ] where @xmath50 indicates the time derivative and the maximization is taken over the set of parameters @xmath47 .    the measure @xmath51 in",
    "is obtained by maximization over the class of gaussian states , a procedure which makes it particularly suitable to asses gaussian preserving channels . on the other hand ,",
    "when applied to a generic channel , it can not be considered as a global property .",
    "this is not a crucial issue for practical applications for at least two reasons . on the one hand",
    ", this choice allows to actually calculate and compare the degree of non - markovianity for continuous variable channels , a task that would not be feasible for non - gaussian states . on the other hand",
    ", it should be noticed that while in principle there are techniques to prepare any kind of single qubit states , the same does not apply to continuous variable systems . as a matter of fact",
    "the class of gaussian states plays a crucial role in quantum information processing , since they can be characterized theoretically in a convenient way , and they can also be generated and manipulated experimentally in a variety of physical systems , ranging from light fields to atomic ensembles .",
    "therefore , our aim in the rest of the paper will be that of characterizing the _ gaussian degree of non - markovianity _ for some relevant gaussian preserving channels .",
    "once we restrict the investigation to gaussian states we still have to face the problem of the maximization procedure , which may be challenging from the numerical point of view , since the domains of some of the involved parameters are unbounded . one way to deal with this issue is to focus on subclasses of gaussian states , e.g. pure coherent states or squeezed states , and therefore reduce the number of parameters involved . on the other hand , it is also possible to bound the domain of definition of the parameters , invoking the same line of reasoning used previously : experimental accessibility .",
    "for example , in practice it is not possible to obtain an arbitrary amount of squeezing  @xcite .",
    "the consequence is then a limitation of the domain of definition and therefore a faster convergence of numerical maximization algorithms . in the cases we examine in the next sections",
    "however we will see that it is not always needed to bound the domain of definition of the parameters .",
    "this is because the maximizing pair of states depends on the strength of the interaction , i.e. , the coupling constant , and for weakly coupled systems , experimentally accessible values for the squeezing and displacement may characterize the maximizing pair .    in the following sections we will assume that the maximum is achieved for pure states , i.e.",
    ", we assume @xmath52 and perform the maximization over the other parameters .",
    "this assumption may be proved for the case of coherent thermal states in the weak coupling regime , whereas we conjecture its validity for the other classes of states .    in the next two sections we introduce two different examples of master equations used to describe the dynamics of continuous variable systems and we study their non - markovian gaussian properties .",

    "we obtain the expression for the fidelity in the weak coupling limit .",

    ", the condition for non - markovianity can be studied by inspecting the derivative of the fidelity with respect to time . because the evolution of any gaussian state depends on time through the function @xmath63",
    "only , we have @xmath64 if @xmath65 and therefore @xmath66 , then expression must always be positive , because the dynamics is described by a divisible map .",
    "therefore for any @xmath67 and any initial pair of states we must have @xmath68 . because the image sets of @xmath63 and @xmath69 are the same , the condition @xmath68 must hold also in the case of a time dependent decay rate . stated in another way , eq .",
    "describes a non - markovian channel if and only if the corresponding dynamical map is non - divisible .",
    "this condition is valid for any pair of initial states .",

    "other analytic results can be also obtained if we consider small values of the coupling constant .",

    "from eq.@xmath77 we can conclude that to first order in the coupling @xmath57 , the quantity @xmath78 is proportional to the integral of the negativity region of the damping rate , and the next contribution appears only to third order .",
    "the measure is then maximized for @xmath79 , a condition which defines a whole set of pairs of states , all of them leading to the same value of @xmath78 to first order in @xmath57 .",

    ". however , in the weak coupling limit the domain is large enough to contain the points for which @xmath79 .",

    "its expression can be simplified if we set @xmath89 @xmath90 where @xmath91 .",
    "we will discuss later on in this section about the maximization of the function @xmath87 .",
    "we notice that the second order term is not zero for squeezed states , suggesting that the first order approximation has a more limited validity than in the case of coherent states .",
    "it is also nontrivial to determine the domain of parameters which allows the expansion to be truncated at first order .",
    "this is due to the more complicated functional form of the fidelity when squeezing , instead of displacement is implemented .",
    "the first order result is then of a similar form to the coherent state case , with a different state dependent coefficient @xmath87 .",
    "it is straightforward to show that this result is independent of the number of negativity periods of @xmath53 .",
    "interesting results can be also derived if we consider now the most general pure gaussian state ( both displacement and squeezing ) . from we can separate the fidelity as a product of two parts @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the exponential part , containing the coherent state amplitudes , and @xmath94 is the fidelity for zero displacement .",
    "a first order expansion in @xmath57 shows that @xmath95 this result gives the non - markovianity measure at first order in @xmath57 with a pair dependent coefficient given by a linear combination of the displacement contributions @xmath96 and the squeezing one @xmath87 .",
    "however , we can not conclude that even at this order the two contribution are completely independent , because the weights appearing in the combination depend on the fact that we applied squeezing and displacement .",
    "for example it is easy to show that @xmath97 is the initial fidelity of the same pair of states with zero displacement , and @xmath98 , is the ratio between the initial fidelity and the initial fidelity without displacement .",
    "it is worth noticing that for coherent - thermal states with equal thermal parameters , i.e. @xmath99 , at first order in the coupling we obtain @xmath100 which is maximized by pure states ( @xmath101 ) , thus supporting our choice to restrict the analysis to pure states only .    as we mentioned before many features of non - markovianity for",
    "the damping channels do not depend on the specific form of the damping rate .",
    "however , for the sake of concreteness let us now consider an example of the damping rate @xmath102 which is characterized by only one interval of negativity , @xmath103 $ ] , and where we are definitely in the weak coupling regime if @xmath104 .",
    "we start the analysis evaluating the non - markovianity of the channel for coherent states and squeezed states .",
    "these results are shown in fig.[f : f1damp ] , where we plot for both classes the non - markovianity evaluated at first order , together with the exact numerical solution obtained by maximizing using the full solution .    .",
    "the dotted blue line is the result obtained by maximizing over coherent states ( the exact solution and the first order approximation coincides ) .",
    "the solid lines are the exact non - markovianities for squezeed states , whereas the dashed lines are the corresponding first order approximations .",
    "black curves correspond to @xmath105,while red ones to @xmath106 .",
    "[ f : f1damp ] ]    the coherent states maximization has been carried out over all the parameters involved and their domain , while for squeezed states we consider two fixed values of the angle @xmath84 between the squeezing directions and then maximize over the magnitudes @xmath107 and @xmath108 , with the maximum value reached for @xmath109 .",
    "two main results are evident : the non - markovianity of the damping channel is larger for squeezed states than for coherent states independently of the value of coupling and increases with decreasing @xmath84 . due to the nature of the master equation we can also state that this result is valid independently of the form of @xmath53 .",
    "the second result is that the first order approximation is well sustained by coherent states while it is violated by squeezed states also for relatively small values of the coupling .",
    "this behavior for squeezed states becomes more and more evident if we reduce the value of the angle @xmath84 , and it can be explained by inspecting eq . for fixed @xmath110 . for small @xmath84 , in fact , the function @xmath87 decreases , thus determining a violation of the first order approximation .",
    "a further discussion of the results is postponed to the final section , after we have provided a more complete picture by discussing the quantum brownian motion model in the next section .",
    "the master equation describing quantum brownian motion ( qbm ) in the interaction picture , under the weak coupling and secular approximations ( see , e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , is given by @xmath111 the diffusion and damping coefficients @xmath112 and @xmath53 can be derived once we provide the analytic form of the spectral density @xmath113 and the temperature @xmath114 of the environment , assumed to be in a thermal state .",
    "their expressions in the weak coupling limit are @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the mean number of thermal photons for a mode of frequency @xmath117 , and @xmath118 is the bare frequency of the system .",
    "the spectral function we are going to consider is the following ohmic spectral density @xmath119 where @xmath120 is a high frequency cutoff function with @xmath121 being the cutoff frequency . usually the cutoff function is chosen to be of lorentzian or exponential form . here",

    "the dynamics generated by eq .",
    "is more involved compared to that of eq .  , and this gives us the opportunity to study in more detail the non - markovianity properties of continuous variable systems .",
    "what is here relevant , compared to the previous case , is the presence of two decay channels , one downward channel and one upward .",
    "this structure leads to the inequivalence of non - divisibility and non - markovianity . for the master equation",

    ".    numerical evaluation of the region of negativity of @xmath135 shows that the zeroes of the derivative are essentially the same as those of the diffusion coefficient @xmath112 , thus suggesting that diffusion is the leading phenomenon for non - markovianity of qbm . in order to prove this result",
    "we should inspect the form of the non - markovianity at the first order in the coupling @xmath57 , in the same spirit as in sec .",

    "an inspection on the magnitudes of the coefficients shows , however , that unless @xmath142 ( the maximum of the measure is instead obtained in the region @xmath143 ) , we have @xmath144 .",
    "therefore , non - markovianity can be approximated by @xmath145 within the validity of the first order expansion this explains why the zeros of essentially coincides with those of @xmath112 .",
    "as for the damping channel , it is possible to derive a closed formula for the non - markovianity of qbm for coherent states .",

    ", we will examine the non - markovianity in different temperature regimes , comparing the first order approximation and the numerical one based on the exact solution .",
    "the temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficients is apparent in its definition .",
    "essentially the coefficient is a sum of a zero temperature term and a contribution from the thermal photons in the bath . respectively , their expressions are @xmath148     and ( a ) : @xmath149 , ( b ) : @xmath150 .",

    "when @xmath169 the measure is zero indicating that the diffusion coefficient has no negativity regions .    for squeezed states , in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we show the comparison between the numerical and first order analytic results for the measure as a function of the coupling constant @xmath57 for small values of the temperature .",
    "we can notice a behavior similar to that of the damping channel case ( see fig .",
    "2a ) , the exact and approximated expressions indeed coincide only for very small value of the coupling .    .",

    "red and black curves show the behavior of squeezed states , blue curves are for coherent states .",
    "dashed ( solid ) curves represent the first order ( numerical ) solution to the maximization problem . for squeezed states",
    "the maximization has been performed with the constraint @xmath109 and for fixed phase @xmath106 ( red curves ) , or @xmath170 ( black curves ) .",
    "for coherent states the maximization has been performed over all their characterizing parameters .",
    "[ fig4 ] ]     + for increasing @xmath57 the non - markovianity saturates to a constant value , which is achieved for smaller @xmath57 when @xmath84 decreases . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we compare the results for coherent and squeezed states , showing that also for the qbm channel squeezed states are more sensitive than coherent states to the non - markovianity of the channel .    ,",
    "@xmath161 and maximized at fixed angle @xmath170 over the squeezing parameters .",
    "different lines correspond to different temperatures : @xmath171 ( black solid ) , @xmath172 ( blue dashed ) , @xmath173 ( red dotted ) and @xmath174 ( green dotted dashed).[fig5 ] ]     + finally in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we plot for fixed parameters @xmath160 , @xmath161 and @xmath170 the numerical results for the measure for different temperatures .",
    "the behavior is qualitatively the same , i.e. we have saturation for increasing @xmath57 and the saturation value increases with temperature , until it reaches a maximum saturation value for high temperatures .",
    "in the previous sections we have analyzed in detail the non - markovianity of two kinds of cv quantum channels , addressing separately the non - markovian behavior for coherent and squeezed states .",
    "the dynamics of coherent states is governed by the evolution of only the displacement amplitude in the damping channels , and by both the displacement and the covariance matrix in the qbm channel case . on the the other hand ,",
    "the dynamics of ( zero amplitude ) squeezed states depends on the covariance matrix only in both cases .",
    "this behavior allows us to address the effects of the two contributions on the amount of non - markovianity of the channel .    despite the difference in the form of the master equations , many common features are apparent . at first",
    ", we notice that squeezed states are in general more sensitive to the non - markovian behavior , as witnessed by the larger non - markovianity compared to coherent states , independently on the value of the coupling and temperature .",
    "generally , for both classes of states , the non - markovianity is mostly related to the sign of the master equation coefficients . for the case of qbm non - markovianity",
    "is mostly due to diffusion described by the coefficient @xmath112 . on the other hand ,",
    "even if the dynamics of the displacement vector is not affected by it [ see eq .",
    "] , it is still fundamental for the class of coherent states .",
    "this behavior is even more evident as the temperature is increased , since the damping is independent of temperature .",
    "another interesting feature is the behavior of the non - markovianity for squeezed states as a function of the coupling and the temperature , in particular for what concerns the quantum brownian motion case . as it is apparent from fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , the value of non - markovianity as a function of the coupling saturates , with a saturation value that increases with the temperature .",
    "this behavior , whose origin may be traced back to the time evolution of the covariance matrices , implies the existence of some bound on the flow of information from the environment back to the open system as a result of the gaussian structure of the map .    in conclusion , we have introduced a measure to quantify the non - markovianity of continuous variable quantum channels and have used it to analyze two paradigmatic gaussian channels : the purely damping channel and the quantum brownian motion channel with ohmic environment . we have considered different classes of gaussian states and found the pairs of states maximizing the backflow of information . for coherent states",
    "we have found analytical solutions , whereas for squeezed states we have resorted to numerical maximization , and also obtained some approximate analytical solutions in the weak coupling limit .",
    "our results are encouraging enough to suggest the use of our measure of non - markovianity to analyze more general gaussian channels , and to assess non - markovianity as a resource for quantum technologies .",
