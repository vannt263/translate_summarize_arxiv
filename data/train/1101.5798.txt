    "ever since the discovery of the dark energy ( de ) @xcite , the fundamental problem of understanding the nature of the positive acceleration of the universe appears lacking of some ingredients in the framework of general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "in addition , observations strongly suggest that matter in the universe is dominated by a non - baryonic ( cold ) dark matter ( dm ) which seems to evolve separately from the unknown force driving the acceleration @xcite . despite neither de nor dm have been directly detected , they represent the most relevant amount of energy and matter in the universe , being almost the 70 and 25 percent of the total content , respectively . a theory propounded to explain their effects and to describe their natures is strictly necessary in cosmology ,",
    "although , up to now , it has not been still definitively formulated @xcite . probably , the most common paradigm trying to include both de and dm , is the so - called @xmath0cdm model @xcite . in this model , a cosmological constant term , @xmath0 ,",
    "is included within the einstein equations and the total matter density is assumed to be the sum of baryonic and dm densities , i.e. @xmath1 .",
    "this model fits excellently and with high - precision all observational data , meanwhile it provides a remarkably small number of cosmological parameters @xcite .",
    "the effects of @xmath0 are _ hidden _ in the definitions of the pressure , @xmath2 , and of matter density , @xmath3 , i.e. @xmath4 , @xmath5 ; thus , by assuming hereafter a ( flat ) friedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) metrics , i.e. @xmath6 $ ] , we can easily write down the correspondent friedmann equations : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath9 the radius of the universe . if @xmath2 and @xmath3 are known ( or equivalently @xmath10 is known ) ,",
    "the above coupled equations describe the dynamics of the universe .    in spite of its simplicity and its triumph in fitting data ,",
    "the @xmath0cdm model suffers from several shortcomings @xcite , as e.g. the problem of fine tuning and the problem of coincidence .",
    "the problem of fine tuning is connected to the large difference between the value of vacuum energy in quantum field theory and the observed value of the cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "the problem of coincidence is related to the incredibly small differences between the densities of de and dm , which are supposed to evolve differently as the universe expands .",
    "moreover , one can notice that at large enough energies ( typically of the order of the planck scale , @xmath11gev/@xmath12 ) , the @xmath0cdm model is supposed to be not reliable anymore ; in other words , it only provides a limited description @xcite of the early stages of the universe . as a consequence ,",
    "the crucial role played by inflation still remains an effective approach without any basis in a fundamental theory .",
    "nevertheless , a quantum gravity ( qg ) theory seems to be necessary to explain these stages @xcite , having as a limit the @xmath0cdm model ; that is clear if one believes that gr is a particular case of a more fundamental theory .",
    "this is the underlying philosophy of what are usually referred to as modified theories of gravity , concerning the modified einstein - hilbert ( eh ) action @xcite . besides fundamental physics motivations , cosmologists acquired a huge interest in all of these theories , thanks to the possibility to reach a unified scheme . among the various alternatives ,",
    "crucial advances have been carried out in the studies of black hole theory and string theory @xcite .",
    "a very intriguing concept , within the framework of gr , is the so - called _ holographic principle _ ( hp ) , which provides some clues for solving the modern theoretical and observational problems without directly modifying the eh action .",
    "as it has been pointed out in qg , the entropy of a system does not scale with the volume of that system , but with the area of its surface @xcite .",
    "starting from the above consideration , the hp postulates that the maximum entropy inside a region is not extensive , but grows as the area of the surface .",
    "therefore , the total number of independent degrees of freedom should scale with the surface area ( in planck units ) as well . in particular",
    ", the principle invokes that @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the planck mass and @xmath15 is the vacuum energy density of a system of size @xmath16 .",
    "actually , the hp represents a new basic principle for both qg and gr , being supported by an effective quantum field theory . in order to include this principle in a real cosmological scenario",
    ", one needs to choose the correct cosmological length scale @xmath16 , which is not _ a priori _ known .",
    "since the cosmological system is the universe , the de should be associated with the scale density , namely @xmath17 .",
    "writing the fraction of de density in the form @xmath18 , we can imagine different holographic approaches by choosing different ir cutoffs .",
    "for instance , for the case of the @xmath0cdm , if the hubble parameter @xmath10 is taken to be the characteristic scale of the universe , then it is natural to postulate @xmath19 ; unfortunately this scenario fails in reproducing the positive acceleration of universe . nevertheless , from the hp principle , it would be possible to solve both the problems of fine tuning and coincidence just by introducing the correct length scale . in order to fix such a scale ,",
    "many approaches have been investigated in literature . in the",
    "so - called _ holographic dark energy model _ ( hde ) @xcite the future event horizon of the universe characterizes the length @xmath16 , i.e. @xmath20 an alternative is the so - called agegraphic model ( ade ) @xcite , where the ir cutoff is the conformal age of the universe , @xmath21 unfortunately , the choice of a length scale is neither so easy nor arbitrary , since it leaves unclear some conceptual problems .",
    "as pointed out by cai @xcite , a drawback , concerning causality , appears in the above scenarios : how is it possible that a local quantity , as e.g. the de , could be explained by global concepts , derived from the physics of space - time ?",
    "is there a mechanism allowing a local quantity to be determined by a global one @xcite ?",
    "a crucial issue is that the above cosmological lengths are originated from an expanding universe , which is an _ a priori _ assumption and not the result of a certain model , as it should be . in order to solve this problem and inspired by the hp , we suggest to choose as length scales only those quantities which are invariant under geometrical transformations , avoiding the causality issue .",
    "this allows to solve both the coincidence and fine - tuning problems , as well .",
    "the invariants of curvature , derived from the ricci scalar @xmath22 , the weyl tensor @xmath23 and the riemann tensor @xmath24 , are based on such theoretical implicit assumptions and represent geometrical invariants .",
    "gao @xcite suggested , for the first time , that the de density could be proportional to the first order invariant @xmath22 : @xmath25 in this work we extend the analysis by gao to the case of _ second order _ ( independent ) invariants .",
    "notice that a second order invariant is proportional to the inverse fourth power of an ir cutoff , then indicating with @xmath26 the i - th independent second order invariant , our assumption should be formulated as follows @xmath27 the purpose of the present article is to study the models originating from these invariants and their implications on the frw spacetime . as shown below , these models fairly overcome the problem of the length scale , providing a good solution for the de problem @xcite and indicating a good agreement with the theoretical predictions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we develop the theory of the independent second order invariants for a flat frw universe and we analyze the outcomes of the assumption ( @xmath28 ) in cosmology . in section iii",
    "we fit our models with the cosmological data from supernovae ia ( sneia ) , baryonic acoustic oscillation ( bao ) and cosmological microwave background ( cmb ) . in section iv",
    ", we provide a comparison with other relevant cosmological models and we make use of model independent statistical tests , i.e. the aic and bic . finally in section",
    "v we present the conclusions .",
    "the basic purpose of this work is to invoke the hp and to relate the second order curvature ( independent ) invariants to the de density ( as already discussed , the case of the first order curvature invariant has been extensively treated by gao @xcite ) .",
    "this can be easily performed by writing down the explicit form of the second order geometrical invariants for a frw metric and by using eq .",
    "( @xmath28 ) . as pointed out in ref.@xcite , among the 14 curvature scalar invariants @xcite , the most interesting ones are the kretschmann , the chern - pontryagin and euler invariants .",
    "we can write , for every spacetime @xcite , their expressions as follows @xmath29_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta}r^{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta}\\ , , \\nonumber \\\\ k_3 & = & [ { } ^*r{}^*]{}_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta}r^{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the stars indicate the correspondent dual counterparts .",
    "from the first matt - decomposition of the weyl tensor , it is easy to get @xcite @xmath30 therefore , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 can be expressed as follows @xmath34_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta}c^{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta}=i_2\\,\\nonumber\\\\ k_3&=&-c_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta}c^{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta}+2r_{\\alpha\\beta}r^{\\alpha\\beta}-\\frac{2}{3}r^2= \\nonumber \\\\ & = & -i_1 + 2r_{\\alpha\\beta}r^{\\alpha\\beta}-\\frac{2}{3}r^2\\,.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from the above equations it is straightforward to infer the explicit expressions of the second order invariants in a frw universe : @xmath35 the hp postulate reads @xmath36 where @xmath37 is an dimensionless constant and should not be confused with the tensorial index .    by combining together eqs .",
    "( @xmath38 ) and ( @xmath39 ) and by using the above expressions for @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( the only two non - trivial invariants ) , we obtain two differential equations , each one providing the temporal evolution of the hubble parameter . a first interesting step consists in solving the associated differential equations numerically for both @xmath40 and @xmath41 , finding the correspondent acceleration parameters , by using the definition @xmath42 and the effective barotropic parameters , expressed by @xmath43 for both the models .    from now on , we will refer to the cosmological models arising from the invariants @xmath40 and @xmath41 as @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively . in order to fix the free parameters of our two models , we need to find for which values of @xmath37 , the conditions @xmath46 and @xmath47 at redshift @xmath48 are fulfilled .",
    "the corresponding intervals are @xmath49 $ ] and @xmath50 $ ] for @xmath44 and @xmath45 respectively . in figures [ 1q ] , [ 1w ] , [ 3q ] and [ ew ] we plot @xmath51 and @xmath52 as functions of the redshift for both @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "as shown in the pictures , if we set @xmath53 for @xmath44 and @xmath54 for @xmath45 we get the expected accelerated behavior of the universe , being @xmath55 and @xmath47 .",
    "in particular , the results obtained with the two models suggest that the universe is accelerating since @xmath56 .     as a function of the redshift @xmath57 for @xmath44 ( in this case we use conventionally @xmath53 ) .",
    "note that @xmath58 is negative for @xmath59 , providing an accelerated behavior of the universe since @xmath60 ; this is quite in agreement with the prediction of @xmath0cdm which refers to @xmath61 .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] !     as a function of the redshift @xmath57 for @xmath44 ( in this case we use @xmath53 ) .",
    "notice that @xmath62 at @xmath48 , behaving as a cosmological constant at low redshift . ]    .     as a function of the redshift @xmath57 for @xmath45 ( in this case we use @xmath54 ) .",
    "again @xmath58 is negative for @xmath59 , providing an accelerated behavior of the universe since @xmath60 until now . ]     as a function of the redshift @xmath57 for @xmath45 ( in this case we use @xmath54 ) .",
    "notice that again @xmath62 at @xmath48 , behaving in this case too as a cosmological constant term at low redshift . ]    once determined @xmath51 and @xmath52 we can characterize completely the kinematics of the models . in the following section we will check the agreement of our models with the observations . in particular , we will make use of three independent tests : sneia , bao and cmb .",
    "in this section we perform an experimental combined procedure , by using a fairly typical combination of kinematical data .",
    "in particular we employ the three most common fitting procedures : sneia , bao and cmb ; the first two concern low redshift data sets spanning from @xmath48 to @xmath63 , while the third is a higher redshift test , since it is performed at @xmath64 .",
    "it is well established that standard candle data from sneia are indicators of distance , able to fit the correspondent luminosity distances for a particular class of models , by considering the distance modulus and the correspondent redshift @xmath57 .",
    "the problem of the systematics , which usually affects these measures , can be avoided or at least reduced , by the use of the most recent updated union 2 compilation @xcite , instead of other older samples @xcite .",
    "then , associating to each supernova modulus @xmath65 the corresponding @xmath66 error , denoted by @xmath67 , we can perform directly the experimental analysis . to this purpose ,",
    "let us rewrite the distance modulus @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the luminosity distance , defined by @xmath70 since the likelihood function @xmath71 is related to the chi - square statistic , i.e. @xmath72 , we constrain the free parameters of a model , by minimizing the quantity @xmath73    the second test that we perform is related to the observations of large scale galaxy clusterings , which provide the signatures of the bao @xcite .",
    "in particular we use the measurement of the peak of luminous red galaxies observed in sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , usually denoted by @xmath74 and defined as follows    @xmath75^{\\frac{1}{3 } } \\left [ \\frac{1}{z_{bao}}\\int_0^{z_{bao } } \\frac{h_0}{h(z)}dz\\right]^{\\frac{2}{3}}\\,,\\ ] ]    with @xmath76 .",
    "in addition , the observed @xmath74 is estimated to be @xmath77 with an error @xmath78 . in the case of the bao measurement",
    "we should perform the following minimization : @xmath79    finally , concerning the cmb , we first analyze the so - called cmb shift parameter @xmath80    since this standard ruler is fixed by the sound horizon at decoupling ( @xmath81 @xcite ) , it gives a complementary bound to the sneia data and bao as well . for the @xmath22 parameter , the observed value is @xmath82 , as inferred from the wmap 7 data @xcite .",
    "hence , the correspondent cmb constraints are given by minimizing the chi square @xmath83    moreover , we notice that , differently from sneia , bao and cmb do not depend on @xmath84 .    finally , by combining the minimization procedures for sneia , cmb and bao , we constrain the parameters of our two models .",
    "the numerical results are summarized in the following tables :    .summary of the results for @xmath44 ; in this case we have @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     where we have used : @xmath90 for @xmath0cdm ; @xmath91 and @xmath92 for @xmath93cdm ; @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 for cpl @xcite ; @xmath97 and @xmath98 for the ricci de .",
    "the results have been obtained through a direct analysis of each model , following the combined procedure explained in section iii .",
    "we can conclude that our models are disfavored by the aic and bic analysis if compared with @xmath0cdm and @xmath93cdm .",
    "it is clear that @xmath0cdm remains the favorite model . on the other hand ,",
    "the results obtained for the ricci de are even worst .",
    "this seems to suggest that using higher order invariants is better than using invariants of lower order , encouraging further investigations in our direction .",
    "concerning the cpl model , it is interesting to notice that , to a slight variation of @xmath99 and @xmath100 , it corresponds a large variation of aic and bic .",
    "this is in agreement with the fact that cpl is a three parameters approach , then it appears disfavored if compared with @xmath101 and @xmath45 .",
    "in this work we have investigated the possibility to relate the de term with the second order independent invariants @xmath26 .",
    "this has been performed in analogy with the work of gao @xcite , who proposed a first order invariant approach , namely the ricci de .",
    "the validity of our idea is based on the holographic principle , which requires the existence of a cut - off scale , characterizing the dark energy .",
    "moreover , the latter must scale with the inverse square of the cut - off ( which means @xmath102 ) . after solving numerically the friedmann equations for the two non - trivial invariants in a flat frw universe",
    ", we tested the two resulting models , namely @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "hence , we first analyzed the kinematics of the two models in terms of the acceleration parameter @xmath51 and in terms of the barotropic factor @xmath52 , showing that they are compatible with the conditions @xmath103 and @xmath47 at @xmath48 . then , we developed a test combining sneia , bao and cmb in order to fix the cosmological parameters ; again in this case we found a good agreement with the experimental results .",
    "it is also important to notice that the two models , arising from different invariants , show an incredibly similar behavior .    a robust evidence of the validity of the models is given by the aic and bic tests , where we get results better than those obtained with the ricci de approach .",
    "therefore , our models are compatible with the holographic principle and seem to behave better than the first order invariant proposed by gao .",
    "this encourages to study higher order invariants , what will be done in future works .",
