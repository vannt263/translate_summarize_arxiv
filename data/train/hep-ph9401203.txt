    "the quark  antiquark systems consisting of one heavy quark ( antiquark ) @xmath4 and one light antiquark ( quark ) @xmath5 are qcd analogs of the hydrogen atom and thus are of fundamental importance .",
    "recently the issue of the heavy ",
    "light bosons has become a topic of vivid interest in both analytic and monte carlo qcd studies [ 1 ] .    from the theoretical viewpoint the interest in heavy ",
    "light systems stems from several considerations .",
    "first , in the limit of one infinitely heavy quark , one hopes to get the dynamics of a light quark in the external field of a heavy one .",
    "that would be similar to the picture of the hydrogen atom .",
    "second , since the external field is time - independent , one may hope to obtain a static potential in qcd together with spin - dependent forces , as has been done for heavy quarkonia [ 2 ] .",
    "an important issue in this connection is the lorentz nature of the confining part of the potential .",
    "arguments in favor of a scalar nature are found in the form of inequalities [ 3 ] and also in the form of spin - dependent terms [ 2,4 ] .",
    "third , in the heavy ",
    "light system one may study how the chiral symmetry breaking ( csb ) affects the spectrum .",
    "when one quark mass is vanishing , in the chiral symmetric case the spectrum would consist of parity doublets , and the csb would lift the degeneracy .",
    "fourth , using the dirac equation we implement explicitly relativistic dynamics and can study relativistic properties of the spectrum , e.g. , in the case of a vanishing quark mass , and also relativistic spin splittings in the spectrum .    in particular , in our case the spin symmetry now",
    "being widely discussed [ 1 ] is present , since the spin of the heavy quark is decoupled .",
    "hence every state of the dirac equation with a given @xmath6 and parity corresponds to two almost degenerate states of the @xmath7 system with @xmath8 and the heavy quark spin @xmath9 adding to @xmath10 .",
    "our final point is that the dirac equation description yields a dynamical framework for the heavy",
    " light mesons which can be used to calculate meson matrix elements and form factors to compare with experiment and semiphenomenological approaches now widely used in this context [ 1,5 ] .    here",
    "we attempt to derive explicitly the dirac equation for the heavy  light quark system starting from the qcd lagrangian and incorporating both perturbative and nonperturbative effects in the framework of the vacuum correlator method ( vcm ) [ 68 ] .    in the course of the derivation we use some approximations , which are clearly stated at each step , e.g. , neglect of virtual quark pairs ( the quenching approximation ) , keeping the lowest ( quadratic ) cumulant in the cluster expansion , and the `` limit of local dynamics '' [ 2 ] , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the gluonic vacuum correlation length .",
    "we discuss physical implications of these approximations in the main text below .",
    "even with those approximations we are unable to prove rigorously the appearance of a static scalar confining potential , but we give strong arguments in favor of it .",
    "the situation is much better for the perturbative part , and the existence of a external vector potential in the limit of one heavy quark mass is explicitly shown .    at this point",
    "we start with the dirac equation containing a vector coulomb part and a scalar confining part , and we study properties of its spectrum . for comparison",
    "we also consider two other cases : i)the equation has a vector confining part and a coulomb part ; ii ) both parts of the potential transform as scalars .",
    "we are explicitly interested in the limit of a vanishing light quark mass and the spin dependence of the energy eigenvalues .",
    "we show explicitly that a reasonable spectrum occurs only for a scalar confining part . in this case",
    "the scalar potential breaks explicitly chiral symmetry , and states with opposite parities are not degenerate . in the case of a vector confining part ,",
    "only quasistationary states are found .",
    "we write possible general symmetry properties of spectral states and also the corresponding properties in the particular cases of a zero scalar potential , a zero vector potential , and a zero mass .    we also find some exact analytic solutions of the dirac equation which occur for @xmath13 .",
    "this enables us to find an equation , which determines that value of the coulomb constant @xmath14 , for which the @xmath15 discrete energy level reaches the value @xmath13 .",
    "we note an analogy of this problem with the relativistic coulomb problem of an electron in the field of a heavy supercritical nucleus with @xmath16 [ 911 ] .    the paper is organized as follow . in sec .",
    "2 we use the feynman  schwinger representation of the quark  antiquark green function to derive the limit of one infinit mass .    in sec .",
    "3 we compare this limit with the dirac equation and discuss the lorentz nature of the confining interaction .    in sec .",
    "4 we discuss the properties of the spectrum of the dirac equation .    in sec .",
    "5 we discuss symmetry properties of the spectrum , in particular chiral properties .    in sec .",
    "6 we discuss numerical results for the spectrum of the dirac equation in the limit of a vanishing small quark mass .    in sec .",
    "7 we investigate the exact analytic solutions of the dirac equation which occur for @xmath13 .    in sec .",
    "8 we summarize our results and compare the dirac spectrum obtained here with experiment and other approaches .",
    "this enables us to also discuss large - mass corrections .",
    "consider the quark  antiquark system of one heavy antiquark ( with mass @xmath17 ) and a light quark of much smaller mass @xmath18 , which we neglect in some cases below .    the green s function @xmath19 of such a system , with the quarks initially at points @xmath20 , @xmath21 and finally at points @xmath22 , @xmath23 , is given by the path integral over fermionic and gluonic fields a in ref .",
    "[ 8 ] . evaluating the fermionic integrals and neglecting the fermionic determinants ( the quenching approximation ) for simplicity ,",
    "one arrives at the amplitude depicted graphically in fig.1 , where @xmath24 is the quark green s function with quark mass @xmath25 , and the @xmath26 s belong to the initial and final wave functions :    @xmath27 with a similar expression for @xmath28 .",
    "thus we can write @xmath29\\rangle .\\ ] ] the angular brackets here denote the integration over gluonic fields .",
    "this integration we perform using the cluster expansion [ 6,7 ] .",
    "we arrive at the following expression involving proper - time and path integrals for the quark @xmath30 and the antiquark @xmath31 : @xmath32,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33    @xmath34 in ( 2 ) , @xmath35 , @xmath36 refer to the lorentz structures in the initial and final states , and @xmath37 and @xmath38 are given in ref .",
    "we rewrite the latter here in the following form ( in the lowest order of a cluster expansion , where perturbative and nonperturbative contributions factorize [ 8 ] ) : @xmath39,\\ ] ] where @xmath40 and @xmath41 @xmath42 is the gluonic correlator .",
    "the latter can be split into perturbative and nonperturbative parts as in ref .",
    "now we discuss the limit of one heavy mass , @xmath43 . in this case , when @xmath17 is much larger than the interaction strength , particle 2 is moving along the straight - line trajectory @xmath44 @xmath45 is the position in space of particle 2 .",
    "one can see that in this limit the spin interaction of particle 2 ( terms @xmath46 ) is @xmath47 and can be neglected .",
    "the perturbative part of the cumulant @xmath48 can be written as [ 6,7 ] @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the quadratic casimir operator , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 is the closed contour depicted in fig.1 .",
    "the integral in ( 6 ) is divergent and is regularized by inserting a @xmath55 factor in front of the exponential in ( 3 ) and introducing the minimal distance @xmath56 of the points @xmath57 and @xmath58 in ( 6 ) ( for details see [ 12 ] ) .",
    "therefore we can now study the situation when only the perturbative interaction is present , and the green s function looks like @xmath59 \\times \\\\ % \\nonumber \\times \\gamma_y ( m_2(1-\\gamma_4))],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have neglected terms representing the self - interaction of particle 1 .",

    "we now turn to the nonperturbative interaction , which provides confinement due to the presence of the special ( kronecker ) structure in the quadratic cumulant [ 6 ] . again neglecting the self - interaction of light particle",
    ", we find an equation of the same form as ( 7 ) , but we should add @xmath64 @xmath65 also the nonperturbative part @xmath75 , which can be written as [ 6 ] @xmath76 + \\mu\\rho \\leftrightarrow \\nu\\lambda \\right\\ } d_1(u - u').\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it has been shown [ 6,7 ] that only @xmath2 ( and not @xmath77 ) yields confinement ( the area law of the wilson loop ) .",
    "we concentrate first on this term , disregarding also the spin term @xmath78 in ( 7 ) .",
    "we have @xmath79 using the same arguments as in [ 6 ] , one can see that we get the area - law exponential function in ( 7 ) .",
    "namely , for large area we have @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the minimal area inside the contour formed by the straight - line trajectory of the heavy particle and the path @xmath82 of the light one .",
    "we are now facing some fundamental questions : i ) can the term ( 17 ) be associated with a local potential @xmath83 , acting on particle 1 ?",
    "ii ) what are the lorentz properties of this potential  does it transform as a scalar or as a vector ?",
    "to answer question i ) we follow the arguments given in [ 2 ] .",
    "we must therefore return to the exponential function in ( 3 ) , defining the dynamics of the system .",
    "the integral in the exponential function in ( 3 ) is over the surface inside the quark and antiquark trajectories ; the characteristic length of these trajectories is @xmath84 , a period of quark orbiting .    being at some point @xmath85 on the trajectory , a quark is influenced by the fields and through them by its partner .",
    "the radius of nonlocality of the fields is given by the correlation length @xmath12 , defining behavior of @xmath86 , i.e. , by the functions @xmath87 , @xmath88 .",
    "therefore the criterion of local dynamics is @xmath89 [ 2,14 ] .    in the opposite case , @xmath90 ,",
    "the quark `` feels '' all the fields and also the motion of the antiquark during all its history .",
    "this is the nonlocal dynamics , which can be treated by the @xmath91 sum rules [ 15 ] .",
    "lattice calculations yield @xmath92 fm [ 16 ] , while @xmath84 for both the light and heavy quarks is @xmath93 fm .",
    "therefore the actual situation is close to the local dynamics .",
    "regarding the first point , we proceed as in [ 8 , 17 ] , forming the minimal surface via the connection of @xmath94 , where @xmath95 .    in this case , combining all exponential functions in ( 13 ) and ( 17 ) , we obtain @xmath96 , \\ ] ] where we have defined , as in [ 8,18 ] , @xmath97    taking ( 5 ) into account , we have @xmath98    following the same procedure as in [ 8,18 ] , we obtain from @xmath3 ( considered as an action ) the proper - time hamiltonian , which depends on the dynamical mass @xmath99 : @xmath100    the eigenvalue of @xmath101 is to be minimized with respect to @xmath99 ; the final value of @xmath99 is determined in this manner .",
    "thus we see that the nonperturbative correlator @xmath102 does indeed yield a potential - type term in the proper - time hamiltonian , provided @xmath12 is small [ 2 ] and the expansion of the square - root term in @xmath103 is done as in [ 18 ] ( the corresponding error is @xmath10410% ) .",
    "it is more difficult to answer the other question  about the lorentz nature of this potential  since eq .",
    "( 21 ) is written in the c.m .",
    "system , and we do not know how this expression transforms under lorentz boosts . to get a partial understanding of this point ,",
    "let us compare how the vector and scalar potentials enter the feynman ",
    "schwinger representation for the green s function of a scalar quark [ i.e. , neglecting a spin term @xmath105 in ( 13 ) ] .",
    "for the scalar case we can write    @xmath106 , \\ ] ]    while for the vector case we have @xmath107    the main difference lies in the fact that trajectories of the @xmath55-type depicted in fig.2 ( virtual pair creation ) give different contributions in the scalar and vector case . for the scalar case the proper time intervals @xmath108 ,",
    "@xmath109 , and @xmath110 are positive and add together , thereby suppressing the pair creation , while in the vector case @xmath111 , and @xmath112 strongly cancel each other , making pair creation easy . in other words , for the scalar potential all parts of a trajectory add arithmetically , while for the vector potential should take a vector sum of all intervals along the trajectory .",
    "looking at our prototype of the potential , the last term in ( 18 ) , one can see that in this case one actually adds a scalar quantity @xmath113 ( we recall that @xmath114 is not the fourth component of a vector , but rather the proper time @xmath115 , which is scalar ) .",
    "thus we seem to be justified in treating the confining force as a scalar and not a vector",
    ".    there are additional arguments in favor of this conclusion .",
    "first of all , in the nonrelativistic derivation of spin - dependent forces in nonperturbative qcd [ 2 ] , the sign and magnitude of the spin  orbit term depend on whether the confining potential is chosen as a scalar or a vector [ 4 ] . in appendix",
    "b we reproduce the spin - dependent terms obtained in [ 2 ] , for the case of two nonrelativistic quarks .",
    "one can notice that the asymptotically dominant contribution comes from @xmath116 , which contains only a scalar contribution and yields the negative coefficient of the spin ",
    "orbit term @xmath117 , characteristic of thomas precession .",
    "results obtained in [ 2 ] through the use of the cluster expansion and the area law unambigiously predict the spin ",
    "orbit force corresponding to the thomas precession term , which was also introduce a previously using the string picture [ 19 ] . all that corresponds to scalar confinement .",
    "second , there are independent arguments in [ 3 ] which lead to inequalities which are satisfied for the scalar confining potential , and not satisfied for vector case .",
    "finally , the vector confining potential is believed to cause the klein paradox [ 10,11 ] . in sec . 4 and 6 we study both scalar and vector confining potentials and show analytically and numerically that , indeed , only in the first case does one obtain a physically consistent spectrum , corresponding to confinement while in the second case one has only quasistationary states .",
    "this situation is related to the klein paradox [ 10,11 ] .",
    "thus we give strong arguments in favor of the scalar confining potential .",
    "unfortunately at the moment we are still unable to derive from the feynman ",
    "schwinger representation the dirac equation with the scalar potential , in the way we have done for a perturbative coulomb interaction .",
    "therefore in the next sections we simply postulate the dirac equation with a confining potential of the scalar type ( or vector type  to check its inconsistency ) .",
    "as we showed in the previous sections , the color coulomb interaction between quarks is of a vector nature .",
    "we have argued that the confining interaction is a scalar .",
    "it is instructive , nevertheless , to consider both possibilities for the interactions , scalar @xmath118 and vector @xmath83 , and to study the properties of solutions of the dirac equation in these cases .    assuming spherical symmetry",
    ", we look for solutions of the dirac equation in the form @xmath119 where @xmath120 , and the @xmath121 s are spherical spinors [ 20 ] .    equations for radial wave functions are @xmath122f=0,\\\\ \\frac{df}{dr } - \\frac{\\kappa}{r}f + [ e - m - u(r)-v(r)]g=0 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath123 and @xmath124 are the energy and mass of the light particle ( @xmath125 in the notation of sec .",
    "2 ) , and    @xmath126    so that @xmath127 we consider three choices .",
    "\\a ) assume @xmath128    putting @xmath129 and introducing the dimensionless variables @xmath130 and @xmath131 , we arrive at @xmath132 ( hereafter the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath22 ) .",
    "let us find the asymptotics of the radial functions at zero and infinity .",
    "for @xmath133 , inserting the expansions @xmath134 into ( 28 ) , we obtain @xmath135    the wave function is regular at zero for @xmath136 while for @xmath137 there occurs a `` collapse to the center '' ( well known in quantum mechanics ) [ 21,22 ] .",
    "the difficulty is actually of a formal character and can be removed by introducing a cutoff of the coulomb potential at small distances , @xmath138  in the same way as in qed with the charge @xmath139 ( see refs .",
    "[ 911 , 23,24 ] ) .    the behavior of the wave functions at infinity is more complicated . from ( 28 )",
    "it follows that @xmath140 as @xmath141 , and the solution with a positive exponent is clearly not admissible .",

    "thus the wave functions fall off at infinity mostly in the same way as in the case of the harmonic oscillator in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "the solution satisfying the conditions obtained above , ( 29 ) and ( 30 ) , exists only for certain values of @xmath146 , and the wave function is normalizable .",

    "well one can obtain an exact analytic equation for the spectrum [ 25 ] .",
    "the width of these quasistationary states determines the probability of spontaneous pair creation in potential ( 33 ) .",
