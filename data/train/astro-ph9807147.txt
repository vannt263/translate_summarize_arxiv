    "it is now well known that gravitational lensing statistics is a useful probe of the geometry of the universe , especially for the determination of the cosmological constant . in a recent paper ( cooray 1998 ; hereafter c98 ) , we calculated the expected number of gravitationally lensed arcs on the sky due to foreground galaxy clusters as a function of cosmological parameters .",
    "the expected number of arcs was calculated based on the redshift distribution of hdf galaxies ( williams et al .",
    "1996 ) , as determined by the photometric redshift catalog of sawicki et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , with an extrapolation to the whole sky .",
    "similar to optical arcs , galaxy clusters are expected to lens background radio sources .",
    "such lensed sources with high magnification should appear as arcs in radio surveys .",
    "the number statistics of lensed radio sources can be used to determine the cosmological parameters , to study the radio source evolution at high redshifts , and as discussed later , properties of star forming galaxies at moderate to high redshifts .",
    "the number statistics of lensed radio sources due to foreground clusters were first calculated by wu & hammer ( 1993 ) .",
    "they predicted @xmath3 10 lensed radio sources on the sky down to a flux density limit of 0.1 mjy , and @xmath3 100 lensed radio sources down to 10 @xmath0jy at 2.7 ghz ( figure  10 in wu & hammer 1993 ) . at the source detection level of the vla first survey ( @xmath3 1 mjy",
    "; becker , white & helfand 1995 ) , there is only @xmath3 2 to 3 lensed radio sources expected on the whole sky , and when compared to the area of the survey and its resolution , it is likely that there is no lensed source present .",
    "this prediction is compatible with observational attempts to find lensed radio sources ; andernach , gubanov & slee ( 1997 ) searched the first survey near abell cluster cores and found no convincing candidates , and a statistical analysis of the radio positions towards clusters showed no preferential tangential orientation , as expected from gravitational lensing .",
    "recently , a sub - mm selected source , smm02399 - 0136 , towards cluster a370 was found to be lensed with an amplification of 2.5 ( ivison et al .",
    "the source was detected at 1.4 ghz , with a flux density of @xmath3 525 @xmath0jy .",
    "this detection prompted us to calculate the expected number of lensed @xmath0jy sources present on the sky due to foreground clusters , and to refine the previous predictions in wu & hammer ( 1993 ) .",
    "since the predictions in wu & hammer ( 1993 ) for sources down to mjy level are still expected to be valid , we will only concentrate on the @xmath0jy sources here .    in ",
    "2 we describe our calculation and its inputs . in   3",
    "we discuss the possibility of detecting lensed @xmath0jy sources .",
    "we follow the conventions that the hubble constant , @xmath4 , is 100@xmath5  km  s@xmath6  mpc@xmath6 , the present mean density in the universe in units of the closure density is @xmath7 , and the present normalized cosmological constant is @xmath8 . in a flat universe , @xmath9 .",
    "in order to calculate the lensing rate for background @xmath0jy sources due to foreground galaxy clusters , we model the lensing clusters as singular isothermal spheres ( sis ) and use the analytical filled - beam approximation ( see , e.g. , fukugita et al .",
    "our calculation is similar to that of c98 in which we calculated the expected number of lensed optical arcs on the sky due to foreground galaxy clusters ( see , also , cooray , quashnock & miller 1998 ; hereafter cqm ) .",
    "a main difference between the present paper and c98 is that we have not corrected for magnification bias in the present predictions ( see , e.g. , kochanek 1991 ) , primarily due to the lack of knowledge on the @xmath0jy source luminosity function .",
    "depending on the shape of the luminosity function , or the slope of the number counts , the predicted numbers will either increase or decrease due to magnification . the current consensus on the slope of the @xmath0jy counts ( see , e.g. , windhorst et al .",
    "1985 ) suggests that there will be a slight excess in the number of sources towards clusters due to gravitational lensing amplification .    in order to describe the background @xmath0jy sources",
    ", we describe the redshift and number distribution observed towards the hdf radio sources by richards et al .",
    "the main advantage in using the hdf data is the availability of redshift information for @xmath0jy sources . also , hdf is one of the few areas where a deep radio survey down to a flux limit of @xmath3 2 @xmath0jy at 1.4 ghz has been carried out .",
    "the hdf contains 14 sources with flux densities of the order @xmath3 6 to 500 @xmath0jy at 8.5 ghz , and 11 of these sources have measured spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "we converted the 8.5 ghz flux densities to 1.4 ghz using individual spectral indices as presented by richards et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . for sources with no measured spectral indices",
    ", we assumed an index of 0.4 , the mean spectral index observed for @xmath0jy sources ( fomalont et al .",
    "1991 ; windhorst et al . 1993 ; richards et al .",
    "for the 3 sources with no measured spectroscopic redshifts , we used photometric redshifts from the catalog of fernndez - soto , lanzetta & yahil ( 1998 ) .",
    "we binned the redshift - number distribution in redshift steps of 0.25 , and calculated the lensing probability using filled - beam formalism .",
    "similar to c98 , we calculated the @xmath10 parameter in lensing by describing the foreground lensing clusters using a press - schechter analysis .",
    "we calculated the expected number , @xmath11 , of gravitationally lensed radio sources on the sky as a function of @xmath7 and @xmath12 , and for a minimum amplification of @xmath13 of 2 and 10 respectively .",
    "since we are using the sis model , the amplification is simply equal to the ratio of length to width in observed lensing arcs ( see , e.g. , wu & mao 1996 ) . in table 1 , we list the expected number of strongly lensed arcs on the sky for @xmath14 and 10 .",

    "using the redshift and flux distribution observed for hdf radio sources , we have calculated the expected number of lensed @xmath0jy sources on the sky due to foreground clusters . by extrapolating the observed properties towards the hdf to the whole sky , we have assumed that the hdf is a fair sample of the distant universe .",
    "this assumption may be invalid given that the hdf was carefully selected to avoid bright galaxies and radio sources .",
    "however , we have selected to use the hdf data primarily because of the redshift information for all @xmath0jy sources detected , which is currently not available for other radio surveys with flux limits down to few @xmath0jys .    we have predicted @xmath3 1500 lensed @xmath0jy sources on the sky towards clusters with x - ray luminosities greater than @xmath17 , for a cosmology with @xmath1 and @xmath18 , consistent with recent results based on lensing ( cqm ; kochanek 1996 ) , type ia supernovae ( riess et al . 1998 ) , and galaxy cluster baryonic fraction ( evrard 1997 ) .",

    "we predict a similar , or slightly lower , rate for the @xmath0jy sources , down to a flux density limit of 10 @xmath0jy .",
    "we briefly describe the possibility of detecting such lensed sources in deep radio surveys .",
    "unlike optical surveys , radio surveys with interferometers such as vla and merlin are subjected to effects arising from instrumental limitations , primarily effects associated with resolution .",
    "for example , there is a minimum and a maximum size for sources that can be detected and resolved with an interferometer .",
    "the largest angular scale to which the interferometer is sensitive restricts the detection of high amplification sources , which are expected to appear as arcs , with length to width ratios equal to amplification factors . for the vla a - array at 1.4 ghz , sources larger than @xmath3 15@xmath19 may not likely to be detected .",
    "thus , observations of radio arcs with length to width ratios greater than 10 may not easily be possible . in sis model for gravitational lensing ,",
    "most of the lensed sources appear with amplification factors of 2 to 10",
    ". however , due to the convolution with synthesized beam , ranging from @xmath3 1@xmath19 to 5@xmath19 , such sources are not likely to appear as arcs .",
    "therefore , detection of lensed sources with small amplifications are likely to be confused with foreground and cluster - member radio sources , requiring a selection process to remove such confusing sources .",
    "additional observations , especially optical identifications and redshifts may be required to establish the lensed nature of @xmath0jy sources selected towards clusters .",
    "this is contrary to optical searches , where lensed galaxies can easily be established due to the arc - like appearances .    in the present analysis",
    ", we have used the sis models to calculate the lensing rate . however , certain galaxy clusters have complex potentials with bimodal mass distributions .",
    "a careful analysis of the optical arcs and arclets towards a2218 , have shown that sis models underestimate the lensing rate by as much as a factor of 2 ( bzecourt 1998 ) .",
    "thus , for certain clusters like a2218 and a370 , it is likely that there will be more lensed @xmath0jy sources than the average prediction based on sis models . by considering the ratio between observed number of optical arcs and arclets and the ratio of surface density of optical to @xmath0jy sources",
    ", we find that a2218 and a370 , should contain 2 to 3 lensed @xmath0jy sources down to 10 @xmath0jy at 1.4 ghz . for a370",
    ", one such source has already been recovered ( ivison et al . 1997 ) , through the sub - mm observations of smail , ivison & blain ( 1997 ) .",
    "the vla a - array 1.4 ghz data ( owen & dwarakanath 1998 , in preparation ) , in which the source was detected allows detection of sources down to a flux limit of 50 @xmath0jy beam@xmath6 ( 5 @xmath20 ) .",
    "a quick analysis of the same archival data suggests that there is at least one more @xmath0jy lensed source towards a370 ( cooray et al .",
    "1998 , in preparation ) .",
    "it is likely that deep surveys of galaxy clusters with merlin and vla will allow detection of @xmath0jy radio sources with amplifications of 2 to 10 .    as discussed in richards",
    "( 1998 ; see , also , ivison et al .",
    "1998 ) , @xmath0jy sources carry important information on the star formation rate and history .",
    "our lensing prediction suggests that most of the lensed sources are likely to occur between redshifts of 1 and 3 , with most around a redshift of 2 .",
    "thus , observational searches for lensed sources will allow detection of moderate to high redshift star - forming galaxies .",
    "the search for such galaxies will be aided by the amplification due to gravitational lensing , allowing detections of faint sources , below the flux limits of regular surveys .",
    "it is likely that a careful analysis of lensed @xmath0jy sources will allow the study of star formation at moderate to high redshift galaxies . as discussed in richards",
    "( 1998 ) , the low redshift @xmath0jy sources , associated with spiral galaxies , are not likely to be found through clusters , due to the low lensing rate .",
    "based on our predictions and the detection of lensed sources towards a370 , we strongly recommend that deep observations of lensing clusters be carried out to find lensed sources and that such detections be followed up at other wavelengths .",
    "using the redshift and flux information for hdf radio sources and a press - schechter analysis for clusters of galaxies , we have calculated the expected number of lensed @xmath0jy sources towards galaxy clusters . in a cosmology with @xmath1 and @xmath18 , we predict @xmath3 1500 lensed sources towards clusters . the radio emission associated with @xmath0jy sources",
