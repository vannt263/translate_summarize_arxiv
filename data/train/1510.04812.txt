    "we performed the simulations on an @xmath104 lattice with periodic boundary conditions , which determines which values of the wave vector @xmath38 are allowed in the system .",
    "the wavelength of the spin spiral ( @xmath105 ) was determined from a mean - field model based on calculating the fourier transform @xmath106 of the coupling coefficients in eq .",
    "( [ eqn1])@xcite .",
    "since the @xmath1 surface of the ir fcc lattice has threefold rotational symmetry , the maximal eigenvalues of @xmath106 are almost isotropic for small wave vectors .",
    "this degeneracy could only be broken by higher - order anisotropy terms in the hamiltonian , which we omitted from the calculations ; and the above mentioned boundary conditions , which discretize the values of @xmath38 and fix the direction of the spin spiral wave vector .",
    "the lattice constant of the skyrmion lattice was @xmath107 , corresponding to @xmath108 ir@xmath1 lattice constants or @xmath109 skyrmions in the @xmath110 lattice .",
    "note that @xmath111 is the distance between the skyrmion cores , which is different from the skyrmion core diameter @xmath27@xcite .",
    "due to the periodic boundary conditions , @xmath112 and @xmath111 could only change through topological transitions , that is an addition or removal of a @xmath113 domain wall in a spin spiral or a skyrmion .",
    "it is known from micromagnetic calculations@xcite that both @xmath112 and @xmath111 depend on the external magnetic field at zero temperature . however ,",
    "this dependence is strongest close to a critical field value where the spin spiral and skyrmion lattice states become metastable compared to the field - polarized state and break into @xmath113 domain walls and isolated skyrmions , respectively .",
    "the spin spiral state was not examined close to this critical field since it becomes metastable compared to the skyrmion lattice at a significantly lower field value@xcite . for the skyrmion lattice",
    ", we performed calculations for different @xmath111 values close to the transition into the field - polarized state ( @xmath114 at @xmath115 ) . for @xmath31 , the lattice with @xmath107 had the lowest energy out of the ones commensurate with the @xmath104 lattice ; while for @xmath116 , even the system with a single skyrmion ( @xmath117 ) had higher energy than the field - polarized state .",
    "this leads us to the conclusion that the divergence of @xmath111 happens in a very short interval of magnetic field , in agreement with ref .",
    "this is probably because the divergence of @xmath111 is a consequence of the repulsive interaction between the skyrmions , but this interaction decreases exponentially with the distance between the skyrmions outside the core areas@xcite .",
    "however , using free boundary conditions would not solve the problem with the relaxation of @xmath112 and @xmath111 since the spins at the edges form configurations which also interact with the spin spiral and the skyrmion lattice , see e.g. ref .",
    "the topological charge is also no longer an integer for free boundaries , which complicates the determination of the skyrmion lifetime at finite temperature .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the periodic boundary conditions are probably more appropriate for the simulation of a homogeneous system considered in this paper , while free boundary conditions are preferable in constrained geometries@xcite .",
    "as a function of time .",
    "the parameters are @xmath47 , @xmath118 , @xmath104 . ]     elapsed between skyrmion creation events . the time unit is @xmath79 .",
    "as indicated by the fit , the elapsed time follows exponential distribution @xmath119 .",
    "the parameters are @xmath47 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 . ]",
    "since we can only measure the topological charge @xmath18 of the whole system , the skyrmion lifetime can be calculated from the @xmath122 diagrams , see fig .",
    "[ figs4 ] , under some simplifying assumptions .",
    "firstly , we suppose that the increase and decrease of @xmath18 is only due to the creation and annihilation of downwards pointing skyrmions , while the presence of upwards pointing skyrmions or antiskyrmions is excluded .",
    "this is largely justified at @xmath47 by energy considerations given in appendix  [ secs3 ] .",
    "even if such structures with opposite topological charge would form in the system , we expect that the energy barrier between the field - polarized state and the skyrmion will mainly depend on the isotropic exchange interactions in the system@xcite , which makes no difference between skyrmions and antiskyrmions with opposite topological charges .",
    "secondly , it is impossible to directly follow the creation and annihilation of a single skyrmion if only the net topological charge is calculated . as a seemingly solid approximation we may assume that the time evolution of the skyrmion density per spin @xmath123 follows the master equation @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the creation rate of skyrmions due to thermal fluctuations and @xmath50 is the skyrmion lifetime . in the stationary case , this simplifies to @xmath126 where @xmath127 and @xmath128 are directly measurable by calculating the average time between skyrmion creation events and the average skyrmion number , respectively . we note that none of the parameters in eq .",
    "( [ eqns9 ] ) depend on the lattice size . during the simulations",
    ", we can calculate the average number of skyrmions instead of the density , which is expected to scale linearly with the number of spins @xmath129 .",
    "however , the average time between skyrmion creation events is inversely proportional to @xmath129 because the temperature uniformly excites the spins in the simulated area .",
    "indeed , we found that @xmath50 calculated as the product of the average time between skyrmion creation events and the average skyrmion number was the same within statistical error for the lattice sizes @xmath21 and @xmath130 .",
    "we note that although the topological charge is quantized , the inflation and shrinking of the skyrmion core is not instantaneous but follows a certain time evolution@xcite , similarly to the formation and absorption of bubbles in boiling liquids .",
    "therefore , it is not likely that the skyrmion lifetime , that is the time difference between the creation and annihilation of the same skyrmion , follows exponential distribution as indicated in eq .",
    "( [ eqns8 ] ) , since it is generally used to describe the distribution of instantaneous events such as the detection of particles in a detector or scattering in a solid . on the other hand ,",
    "the skyrmion creation events , that is the jumps in @xmath131 , are instantaneous , meaning that they likely follow a homogeneous poisson point process .",
    "the distribution between neighboring points in the poisson process is exponential , and fig .",
    "[ figs5 ] indicates that the average time between skyrmion creation events is in agreement with this distribution .",
    "fortunately , it is known from the theory of queueing processes that even if the skyrmion lifetime does not follow exponential distribution and therefore eq .",
    "( [ eqns8 ] ) does not hold , the connection between the expectation values in eq .",
    "( [ eqns9 ] ) holds as long as the skyrmion creation process is markovian ( a homogeneous poisson point process ) , and eq .  ( [ eqns9 ] ) is sufficient for the calculation of the average lifetime . for details",
    "about m / g/@xmath132 queueing processes see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we emphasize that considering an ensemble of skyrmions based on eq .",
    "( [ eqns9 ] ) is unavoidable in the fluctuation - disordered state where the average distance between the skyrmions is small . in some recent publications@xcite ,",
    "the skyrmion lifetime was calculated by taking into account a single metastable skyrmion on a ferromagnetic background .",
    "although in this limit the average distance between skyrmions should be considerably larger than in the fluctuation - disordered state , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the calculated skyrmion lifetime depends on the size of the simulated area , and multiple skyrmions may be present simultaneously if the system size is increased . as was discussed after eq .",
    "( [ eqns9 ] ) , we did not find such a dependence of the skyrmion lifetime on the system size .",
    "furthermore , the presence of an ensemble of skyrmions opens different types of processes for a change in the topological charge beyond the usual nucleation and annihilation on a homogeneous background .",
    "these processes include the merging of two skyrmions into one , and the splitting of a single skyrmion into two .",
    "similar merging effects have been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite for a three - dimensional system , when the skyrmion lattice transforms into the spin spiral state as the external magnetic field is decreased .",
    "finally , we note that we only performed the simulations for a fixed value of the damping parameter , @xmath48 .",
    "it is known that the skyrmion lifetime should depend on the damping@xcite , but the energy barrier @xmath133 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn9 ] ) between the skyrmion and field - polarized state should not , as it is related to the interactions in the spin model . due to the exponential dependence on @xmath133 , its value is significantly more important during the determination of lifetime and critical temperature than the value of the prefactor @xmath134 .",
