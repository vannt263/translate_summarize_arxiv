    "the creation of electron - positron pairs through strong fields , which as been predicted theoretically by f. sauter as early as 1931 @xcite but not yet been observed , is nowadays of high interest for both laboratory scientists and astrophysicists @xcite .",
    "the obstacle to be solved is the creation of a sufficiently strong electric field . in this note",
    "we will present an approach to investigate the dynamic response of an ultra - relativistic compressed electron gas subjected to the breathing mode of the underlying nucleus , a system that promises to generate strong electric fields , depending on the mutual dynamics of negative and positive charges .",
    "this model can , with slight modification like an adjustment of proton density , be extrapolated to astrophysical scales . in @xcite",
    "we presented the stationary solutions of pulsating electron gas in the framework of the thomas - fermi model , and we will now recapitulate the main results that are of importance for the present work . in this model",
    "the nucleus is modeled as a sphere of homogenous positive charge distribution .",
    "the electrons are considered a charged perfect fluid with the equation of state of a fermi gas at zero temperature .",
    "since we want to treat the regime around nuclear density we can assume the ultra - relativistic limit @xmath0 for the equation of state , where @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 are energy density , pressure , and number density respectively of the electron gas . throughout the text , natural units @xmath4 , @xmath5 are used .",
    "when we assume the nucleus of proton number @xmath6 to have a radius @xmath7 in units of the pion mass , and provide sufficient external pressure to restrain the electrons to the volume of the nucleus , we obtain the very simple equilibrium configuration @xmath8 the parameter @xmath9 measures the departure of proton density from nuclear densities .",
    "positive and negative charges completely cancel , so there is no electric field in equilibrium .",
    "introducing a time - dependent displacement field @xmath10 and treating euler s and maxwell s equations to first order , one obtains for stationary modes the second order ordinary differential equation @xmath11\\xi(r)=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath12 is the fine structure constant , and @xmath13 is the frequency of the mode that has to be choosen according to approriate boundary conditions .",
    "this leads to @xmath14^{1/2 }    \\ \\ \\ \\mathrm{and}\\ \\ \\ \\ \\xi_n(x)={\\mathcal c}\\,j_{1}\\left(\\pi n\\,r / r_\\mathrm{nuc}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is an arbitrary factor and @xmath16 is the first member of the spherical bessel functions of first kind .",
    "the first member of the spherical bessel functions of first kind @xmath16 allows to construct an orthonormal basis ( see figure [ fig : basisplot ] ) @xmath17 on the interval @xmath18 $ ] with respect to the scalar product @xmath19 to model a driving force acting on the system we can expand the dirac delta function on the surface @xmath20 and the identity function @xmath21 in terms of this basis .",
    "the spatial delta function at the surface can be used in combination with a temporal delta function to model an instantaneous impulse applied to the surface , or in combination with a harmonic temporal function to drive the surface periodically . the identity function in combination with a harmonic temporal function models the breathing mode of a homogenously charged sphere .",
    "to first order , gauss law predicts an electric force proportional to the radius resulting from any contraction or expansion of the sphere .",
    "according to ( [ diffeqn ] ) and ( [ omegan ] ) the basis functions fulfil the equation @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a differential operator in @xmath24 . making the ansatz @xmath25 and plugging it into the equation of motion subject to an external force @xmath26 we can expand in the basis @xmath27 to obtain the independent equations @xmath28 where @xmath29",
    "if the force is applied just for an instant at @xmath30 we can write @xmath31 , and assuming the system initially unperturbed ( @xmath32 for @xmath33 ) the solution to ( [ eqnsom ] ) is @xmath34 if the force is applied at a frequency @xmath35 starting at @xmath30 we can write @xmath36 , and assuming the system initially unperturbed the solution to ( [ eqnsom ] ) is @xmath37 using for @xmath38 now the coefficients of ( [ deltaexpand ] ) or ( [ idexpand ] ) , we can construct various dynamical situtations in the compressed atom .",
    "using the formalism developed above , it is now possible to investigate the response of the electron gas to the nuclear breathing mode for different system sizes from atoms and giant atoms to neutron stars .",
    "the proton density should be determined from beta - equilibrium , while the frequency of the breathing mode has to be inferred from studies of nuclear incompressibility such as @xcite .",
    "an investigation has to take into account the energy budget of the intitial breathing mode , comparing it to the energy transferred to electron gas and electric field , to determine if dampening of the former occurs first .",
