    "pulsars are thought to be born with initial spin periods in the range 10100  ms , implying initial rotational kinetic energies of the order of @xmath0  ergs .",
    "timing observations readily establish that all isolated pulsars are spinning down ; the implied _ spin - down luminosity_is @xmath1 , where @xmath2  g  @xmath3 is the assumed moment of inertia for the neutron star , @xmath4 is the star s rotational period and @xmath5 is the spin period derivative . for typical young pulsars ,",
    "we find spin - down luminosities in the range @xmath6  ergs  s@xmath7 .",
    "it is believed that most of this energy release ends up in a relativistic particle wind ( see melatos , these proceedings ) . at the interface where this wind interacts with its environment ,",
    "a _ pulsar wind nebula _  ( pwn ) is formed .",
    "pwne form an ideal laboratory for studying compact objects , relativistic shocks and particle acceleration , all key themes in a wide range of important astrophysical problems .",
    "while there are wide variations in pwn properties , three broad categories can be considered , loosely representing an evolutionary sequence ( fig .",
    "[ fig_pwne ] ; van der swaluw & downes , these proceedings ; van der swaluw et al .",
    "2004 )    in the youngest systems ( @xmath8  yr ) , @xmath9 is approximately constant as a function of time ; the pwn expands supersonically into unshocked low - density ejecta inside a surrounding expanding supernova remnant ( snr ) . in this phase",
    "the radius of the pwn is small but is accelerating , with an approximate time - dependence @xmath10 ( van der swaluw et al .",
    "2001 , 2004 ) .",
    "pwne likely to be in this phase include the crab nebula ( see fig .  [ fig_pwne][a ] ) , and the pwn powered by psr  j18111925 in the young snr  g11.20.3 ( roberts et al .",
    "2003 ) .    in middle - aged systems ( @xmath1150  kyr )",
    ", the interaction of the expanding supernova ejecta with their surroundings produces both forward and reverse shocks in the snr .",
    "the latter collides with the pulsar wind shock , compressing and distorting the pwn . for a stationary pulsar in a spherically symmetric system",
    ", the pwn now expands subsonically .",
    "however , the effects of inhomogeneities in the surrounding interstellar medium ( ism ) , and of the pulsar s space velocity , can produce a significantly distorted pwn , with the pulsar near one end .",
    "likely examples of pwne in the process of interacting with their snr s reverse shock include g327.71.1 ( van der swaluw & downes , these proceedings ) and b0453685 in the large magellanic cloud ( fig .",
    "[ fig_pwne][b ] ; gaensler et al .",
    "2003 ) .    at later times ( @xmath12  kyr ) , the pulsar will move far from its birth site , and will eventually escape its snr .",
    "the pulsar s motion is now supersonic , and its wind drives a bow shock , confined by ram pressure .",
    "examples of bow shocks include those powered by psrs  b1957 + 20 ( `` the black widow '' ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig_pwne][c ] ; stappers et al .",
    "2003 ) and j17472958 ( `` the mouse '' ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig_mouse][b ] ; gaensler et al .",
    "in the earliest stages of evolution , a pwn is a quasi - spherical expanding wind bubble with a constant central energy source .",
    "close to the pulsar , we expect that wind particles flow freely outward in all directions .",
    "this cold wind is not directly observable . at some distance ( typically @xmath13  pc ) from the pulsar",
    ", this wind is confined by external pressure , and forms a _",
    "termination shock_. particles are accelerated at this shock up to ultrarelativistic energies ( see arons , lyubarsky , these proceedings ) .",
    "downstream of the termination shock , the flow further decelerates and the gyrating particles emit synchrotron emission , forming the observable pwn .    for the crab nebula , the nebular magnetic field strength is high enough to cause significant synchrotron losses at high energies .",
    "we thus observe a centrally filled , linearly polarized source at all wavelengths , but whose extent in the optical and x - ray bands is progressively smaller than seen in the radio . it is sometimes claimed that at radio wavelengths ( where the synchrotron lifetimes are longer than the age of the pwn ) , the pwn s luminosity traces the integrated history of the pulsar spin - down , while in x - rays ( where the radiative lifetimes are short ) , the pwn luminosity traces the current energy output of the central star .",
    "however , while this is broadly true for the crab nebula , there are other young pwne with much weaker magnetic fields , in which synchrotron losses are yet to dominate in x - rays ( e.g. , the pwn around psr  b150958 ; gaensler et al",
    ".  2002a ) .",
    "furthermore , interpretation of a pwn s radio emission as representing an integrated history of the system is complicated by adiabatic losses and the effects of the reverse shock interaction ( reynolds & chevalier 1984 ) .    in cases where synchrotron losses are significant in x - rays",
    ", one expects to see a spectral break somewhere between the radio and x - ray bands . indeed in some cases this is observed ; the break frequency can then be used to estimate the nebular magnetic field strength ( e.g. , manchester et al .",
    "1993 ) . however , in other cases the field strength implied by such a break is unphysically large ( e.g. , green & scheuer 1992 ) , while other pwne appear to have multiple breaks in their spectra ( e.g. , bock & gaensler , these proceedings ) .",
    "clearly spectral features in pwne must be interpreted with caution , particularly when one considers that breaks in the spectrum can also be introduced by pulsar spin - down , or by intrinsic features in the injection spectrum ( e.g. , woltjer et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "as mentioned above , we expect that there is an inner unshocked wind zone in young pwne , bounded by a termination shock at which particles are accelerated . indeed , the superb angular resolution of _ chandra_has revealed in several pwne an underluminous region immediately surrounding the pulsar , surrounded by an x - ray bright termination shock , as shown in figure  [ fig_pwne](a ) .",
    "this clearly demarcates the point at which wind first interacts with its surroundings . in many cases",
    "this shock has a ring - like , rather than a spherical , geometry .",
    "this demonstrates that the synchrotron - emitting particles are concentrated into an equatorial flow around the pulsar spin - axis ( see discussion by melatos , these proceedings ) .",
    "once we have identified this axial symmetry , the position angle and eccentricity of this inner ring immediately provides the orientation of the pulsar in three dimensions , which can prove extremely useful in interpreting pulse profiles and in assessing the presence of `` spin - kick '' alignment ( ng & romani 2004 ) . since the termination shock demarcates the point where the wind and nebular pressures balance , we can write : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the solid angle of the wind , @xmath16 is the radius of the termination shock in the equatorial plane and @xmath4 is the pressure .",
    "if we assume equipartition between fields and particles , equation  ( [ eqn_bg_pressure ] ) then allows us to estimate the mean nebular field strength .",
    "brightness variations are observed around the rims of these inner rings , as expected due to relativistic doppler boosting .",
    "fits to these intensity variations allow us to directly determine the speed of the post - shock flow , @xmath17 ; typical values are @xmath18 ( e.g. , ng & romani 2004 )      r6.5 cm    observations quickly demonstrate that young pwne are not simple spherical bubbles ( e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig_pwne][a ] ) .",
    "many such sources show a clear axial symmetry , with significant elongation around the centrally - located pulsar . in cases where the termination shock can also be identified",
    ", this elongation is always perpendicular to the inner equatorial ring .",
    "it thus appears that the overall elongation of pwne is an imprint of the pulsar spin - axis at much larger scales ; if so , pwn morphologies then provide a simple way to infer the projected orientation of pulsar spin axes .",
    "the overall elongation of young pwne may result from the winding up of nebular magnetic fields due to the pulsar s rotation , producing a toroidal field geometry which affects the dynamics of the pwn s expansion ( begelman & li 1992 ; van der swaluw 2003 ) .",
    "however , in some cases there are striking collimated features , extending up to @xmath19  pc from the pulsar ( e.g. , gaensler et al .",
    "morphologically , these features appear to be high - velocity jets of particles , directed along the spin - axis . indeed both proper motion and spectral measurements of these structures show them to have velocities @xmath20 ( gaensler et al .  2002a ; hester et al .",
    "it is not yet clear what focuses these jets ( see melatos , these proceedings , for a detailed discussion ) ; komissarov & lyubarsky ( 2003 ) have recently carried out simulations which show that hoop stress in the downstream flow above the spin axis may produce this collimation .",
    "multi - epoch data in the radio , optical , infrared , x - ray and possibly even gamma - ray bands all now demonstrate that pwne show significant time variability ( e.g. , hester et al .",
    "2002 ; pavlov et al .  2003 ; ling & wheaton 2003 ; melatos , these proceedings ) .",
    "much of the most rapid variability is observed near or even inside the termination shock ( fig .",
    "[ fig_b1509 ] ; hester 1998 ) , but complicated changes on timescales of months to years are seen in the outer parts of pwne also ( pavlov et al .  2003 ; mori et al . , these proceedings ) .",
    "we are only just beginning to characterize these changes ; clearly they represent a combination of phenomena , corresponding to particle acceleration , streaming instabilities , standing waves and turbulence .",
    "new theoretical attempts to model the time - dependence of pulsar winds and pwne should provide important physical insight into the complicated processes being traced by these data - sets .",
    "pulsar bow shocks provide a laboratory for studying pulsar winds under a particularly well - defined geometry . furthermore , since pulsar positions , distances , spin - down luminosities and velocities are often well - constrained , these systems provide a physical situation which is highly amenable to detailed analysis . until recently , few bow - shock systems were known .",
    "however , recent efforts have identified a series of new systems ( e.g. , olbert et al .",
    "2001 ; gaensler et al .",
    "2002b ) .      an idealized bow shock can be simply understood .",
    "the `` stand - off distance '' between the pulsar and the bow - shock apex is set by balance between ram pressure and wind pressure : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the mass density of the ambient medium and @xmath23 is the pulsar s space velocity .",
    "furthermore , once one has measured @xmath16 , the shape of the bow shock can be completely described by an analytic solution : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the distance of the bow shock from the pulsar at an angle @xmath26 from the apex ( wilkin 1996 ) . in practice ,",
    "a bow - shock pwn has a double - shock structure , consisting of an outer forward shock and an inner termination shock , separated by a contact discontinuity ( see figure  [ fig_mouse][a ] ) .",
    "simulations suggest that the shape of the forward shock is still well - approximated by equation  ( [ eqn_bow ] ) .      at the forward shock ,",
    "we expect to see h@xmath27 emission , resulting from collisional excitation of neutrals in the ism ( e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig_pwne][c ] ) .",
    "six bow shocks have been identified  five around radio pulsars and one around the isolated neutron star rx  j1856.53754 ( chatterjee & cordes 2002 ; gaensler et al .",
    "if @xmath23 is known , the measured stand - off distance can be used to infer the ambient density via equation  ( [ eqn_bow_balance ] ) .",
    "however , uncertainties in the inclination angle of the system ultimately limit the accuracy of such estimates ( gaensler et al .",
    "2002b ) .    for the bow shocks around psr  j04374715 and rx  j1856.53754 , the morphology of the h@xmath27 emission is a good match to the analytic solution of equation  ( [ eqn_bow ] ) ( e.g. , van kerkwijk & kulkarni 2001 ) .",
    "however , in the recently identified cases of psrs  b074028 and j21243358 , there are significant deviations from this geometry , implying some combination of anisotropies in the pulsar wind flow ( possibly corresponding to the torus / jet structures directly imaged in younger systems ; see fig .",
    "[ fig_pwne][a ] ) and structure in the ambient ism ( e.g. , gaensler et al .",
    "2002b ) .    a typical pulsar space velocity of 500  km  s@xmath7 at a distance of 1",
    "kpc corresponds to a proper motion of @xmath28  yr@xmath7 .",
    "the motion of the corresponding bow shock is easily detectable in just a few years .",
    "indeed , chatterjee & cordes ( 2004 ) have recently measured motion of the `` guitar nebula '' powered by psr  b2224 + 65 over a seven - year baseline with _ hst _ , revealing significant changes in the structure and brightness of the optical emission from this pwn over this period .",
    "this and other multi - epoch studies of optical bow shocks will provide a unique measurement of fluctuations in the density of neutral gas in the ism on scales @xmath29  au , filling a crucial gap between the turbulent power spectrum seen in hi  on scales @xmath30  pc and the `` tiny scale atomic structure '' seen at scales @xmath31  au .",
    "just as for crab - like pwne , for bow shocks we expect that the wind flows freely close to the pulsar , before decelerating at a termination shock , located inside the outer shock visible in h@xmath27 .",
    "although the geometry may differ from the crab - like case , it is reasonable to expect that the termination shock should also be a source of particle acceleration in bow shocks , and that we should thus see a central region in x - ray and radio synchrotron emission .    indeed this has been confirmed in several sources , most notably around psrs  b175724 ( `` the duck '' ) ( kaspi et al .",
    "2001 ) , b1853 + 01 ( petre et al .",
    "2002 ) and j17472958 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_mouse][b ] ; gaensler et al.2004 ) .",
    "until recently there were no cases in which both the forward and termination shocks had been identified in the same object . since only the most energetic pulsars produce bright radio and x - ray pwne ( gaensler et al .",
    "2000 ; gotthelf , these proceedings ) , and the radiation from such pulsars might also ionize their surroundings , this is not overly surprising ( chatterjee & cordes 2002 ) . however , in one case , that of the recycled binary pulsar b1957 + 20 , an h@xmath27 bow shock and an enclosed x - ray pwn are both now clearly seen ( fig .",
    "[ fig_pwne][c ] ; stappers et al .",
    "more instances of such systems need to be accumulated before we can hope to understand what controls the observability of each shock in such systems .",
    "observationally , the x - ray and radio emission from pulsar bow shocks forms an elongated trail behind the pulsar ( figs .",
    "[ fig_pwne][c ] & [ fig_mouse][b ] ) . only for psr  b1957",
    "+ 20 have proper motion measurements confirmed that this trail aligns with the pulsar s direction of motion , but it is presumed that in other cases there is a similar alignment .",
    "some authors have assumed these features to be synchrotron `` wakes '' left behind by the pulsar ; in this case the length of the trail , combined with the pulsar s velocity , puts a lower limit on the system s age .",
    "however , in x - rays the radiative lifetimes are far too short to account for the observed extent of these trails ; e.g.for psr  b175724 , kaspi et al .  ( 2001 ) estimate a nebular magnetic field strength of @xmath32  @xmath33 g , which should result in a trail @xmath34 in extent , in contrast to the @xmath35 trail observed .",
    "one possibility is that there is a rapid flow behind the pulsar , which quickly transports particles downstream to form the trail ( wang et al .",
    "1993 ; kaspi et al .",
    "2001 ) .    a recent detailed comparison of _ chandra _  and vla data on the mouse suggests an alternative interpretation .",
    "the mouse shows _",
    "two_components to its bright synchrotron trail : a bright narrow `` tongue '' seen close to the pulsar , and a fainter trail , seen at larger distances downstream , as shown in figure  [ fig_mouse](b ) .",
    "gaensler et al.(2004 ) combine the theory of ion - dominated pulsar winds with hydrodynamic simulations to show that the tongue likely represents the outer surface of the wind termination shock , analogous to the inner ring seen in _ chandra _",
    "images of the crab nebula , but stretched out due to ram pressure from the pulsar s motion .",
    "the fainter elongated trail then corresponds to synchrotron - emitting material seen further downstream .",
    "it is important to note that the tongue feature seen for the mouse resembles the _ entire _ trail seen for systems such as psrs  b175724 and b1957 + 20 .",
    "i thus propose that the trails seen in these bow shocks represent the bright termination shock surrounding the pulsar , with the bulk of the pwn being much larger and much fainter , presumably due to a combination of adiabatic and synchrotron losses .",
    "if this interpretation is correct , then there is no need to invoke a rapid acceleration or collimation of the flow behind the pulsar ; all positions in the tongue represent locations of fresh particle acceleration in the relativistic flow .",
    "interestingly , _",
    "chandra _  images of bow shocks around psr  b1853 + 01 ( petre et al .",
    "2002 ) and cxou  j061705.3 + 222127 ( olbert et al .",
    "2001 ) both show suggestions of a bright tongue surrounded by a fainter trail , as seen for the mouse .",
    "deeper observations are needed to clarify these morphologies .",
    "some beautiful data - sets on pwne are now letting us address a number of fundamental questions regarding these systems .",
    "we clearly now see the termination shock and post - shock flow for crab - like pwne , and the double - shock structure expected for bow - shock systems . we have learned how to use the morphology of these systems to infer a pulsar s spin axis , 3d orientation , and space velocity vector .",
    "we are beginning to explore the time - domain in pwn studies , with which we can probe the dynamics of a pulsar s interaction with its surroundings .",
    "while many questions remain to be answered , we observers no longer need to apologize for our data , and can happily provide our theorist colleagues with the measurements needed to properly address these issues . clearly a new era in the study of pulsars and their winds is now well underway .",
    "i thank all my pwn collaborators for their enthusiastic contributions to the work i have presented .",
    "my research on pwne is supported by nasa through sao grants go2 - 3079x , go2 - 3074x , go3 - 4068x , go2 - 3075x and go3 - 4063a , xmm - newton guest observer grants nag5 - 11376 , nag5 - 13087 and nag5 - 13203 , and ltsa grant nag5 - 13032 ."
