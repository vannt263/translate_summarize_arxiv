    "flux calibrations in physical units for astronomical instruments are required to make comparisons to physical models of observed objects ( kent et al . 2009 ) .",
    "in particular , one of the main incentives for accurate absolute flux standards is the requirement for measuring the relative fluxes of redshifted sn ia spectra in the rest frame in order to constrain the parameters of the dark energy .",
    "these constraints depend only on the precision of the ratio of fluxes from one wavelength to another and not on the absolute flux level",
    ". quantitative descriptions of dark energy are significantly improved when the relative flux with wavelength is known to an accuracy of 1% or better ( aldering et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "absolute flux calibrations of spectrometers and photometers are normally derived from observations of standard stars with well - known spectral energy distributions ( seds ) .",
    "for all _ hubble space telescope _",
    "instruments , all flux calibrations are traceable to three primary wd standards , g191b2b , gd71 , and gd153 . the slopes of these wd seds are determined by non - local thermodynamic equilibrium ( nlte ) model calculations using the hubeny tlusty version-203 code for pure hydrogen atmospheres ( bohlin 2000 , bohlin et al .",

    "1997 ) .",
    "the absolute flux of the models for these three primary standards is set by space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) relative spectrophotometry ( bohlin & gilliland 2004 , bohlin 2007a ) and the megessier ( 1995 ) absolute flux for vega of @xmath2  erg @xmath3 s@xmath4  @xmath4 at 5556    ( 3560  jy or 3562  jy for vacuum wavelengths ) . as discussed in the review by hayes ( 1985 ) , by megessier ( 1995 ) , and in  4.1.1 below",

    "appendix a presents the traditional _ hst _ flux calibration methodology . according to re05 , the _ spitzer _",

    "@xmath10 is the number of detected photo - electrons per second , either @xmath11 predicted from the stellar flux and the system fractional throughput @xmath12 or @xmath13 observed in an infinite - radius photometric aperture .",
    "re05 uses a 10 pixel ( 12 ) reference radius for the published calibration constants ; but these calibrations refer to surface brightness ( see  a.2 and equation ( [ pnucp ] ) ) .",
    "@xmath14 is the flux at the nominal wavelength @xmath15 for a @xmath16 flux spectrum .",
    "@xmath11 is @xmath17 where a=4869  @xmath3 is the collecting area of the _ spitzer _ 85 cm primary mirror with its 14.2% obscuration ( werner 2004 ) .",
    "@xmath18 is the color correction @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the actual stellar spectral flux distribution .",
    "the nominal wavelength is @xmath21 where the term after the first equal sign is from re05 and the term after the second equal sign is the equivalent formulation of hora et  al .",
    "( 2008 ) .",
    "if the seds of the _ hst _ stars in table  1 are used for the flux @xmath20 to produce a new calibration constant @xmath22 and corresponding mean flux @xmath23 , then the ratio of the new to the original calibration is @xmath24 or , equivalently , in terms of integrals over wavelength @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the stellar flux derived with aperture photometry from the _ spitzer _ images , as calibrated with the official calibration constants that appear in the data - file headers .",
    "re05 quotes an uncertainty of 2% in the irac absolute flux calibration .",
    "tests of the numerical integrations over @xmath27 per equation ( [ rat ] ) or over @xmath28 per equation ( [ ratl ] ) are the same to a few parts in @xmath29 .",
    "a specific - intensity calibration for the surface brightness ( see  a.2 ) of diffuse sources requires a measure of the total response to a point source in an infinite aperture , as specified above for @xmath10 .",
    "however , a flux calibration that is strictly for point sources has no such requirement and can be explained simply and elegantly in the case of a stable instrumental configuration with a linear response .",
    "stability means that repeated observations produce the same response , measured in terms of say a background - subtracted net count rate n , while linearity implies that the count rate is directly proportional to the physical flux f , i.e. the ratio of flux to count rate will be the same ratio of f / n over the dynamic range of the system .",
    "there is no restriction on the entrance slit or extraction aperture as long as the same choice is made for both stars and the extracted count rate is repeatable for both stars",
    ". the measured count rate can be in a certain radius aperture for point source photometry or of a certain height for a resolution element of a spectrophotometer .",
    "if one star is a flux standard with known flux , then the ratio f / n defines a point source calibration constant p , so that the second star with unknown flux has the same constant measured ratio ; and the unknown flux is simply f = pn .",
    "this constant p might be alluded to as a sensitivity but is really more properly an inverse sensitivity , because a more sensitive instrument will have a higher count rate for a source of the same flux .",
    "the main complication of this concept is due to the different spectral resolutions of the flux standard and the unknown star .",
    "a common example is a standard star with a tabulated medium resolution sed . for broadband photometry",
    ", the average flux of the standard over the bandpass must be calculated as in equation ( [ favl ] ) or ( [ favnu ] ) , which is straightforward if the spectral resolution is much better than the band width . in the case of a spectrometer calibration with a resolution that is lower than the tabulated resolution of the standard",
    ", the calibration p is defined simply as the known sed , f , binned to the bandpass of the instrument to be calibrated divided by the response spectrum",
    "n for the same standard star .",
    "more properly , p as a function of wavelength is defined as the convolution of the known sed , f , with the instrumental line - spread function , lsf , divided by the count rate spectrum , n , of the standard convolved with the lsf of the standard star spectrum , which brings the numerator and denominator spectra of p to the same resolution and enables a pixel - by - pixel division of f by n after resampling to the same wavelength scale .",
    "this procedure may fail for the case where a low resolution standard star sed must be bootstrapped to a calibration of a much higher resolution spectrometer where the sensitivity of the high resolution data changes significantly over the resolution element of the known sed .",
    "for example , a single echelle order may have a variation in sensitivity by a factor of 10 or more over a wavelength range covered by only one or a few resolution elements of the flux standard .",
    "_ spitzer _ observations of the sources were taken either as part of a cycle 5 director s discretionary time program ( pi : gordon ) or from existing archival observations .",
    "the stars were observed in the four irac bands , and as many as possible were observed in the irs blue peakup band or mips 24  band .",
    "the main goal of the irs blue peakup and mips 24  observations is to check for dust emission ( e.g. , a debris disk ) or faint red companions .",
    "all the irac and irs blue peakup data ( reduction version s18.7.0 ) were downloaded from the _ spitzer _ archive .",
    "the photometry is measured using a 3 pixel radius aperture and sky annulus with radii of 10 and 20 pixels on each individual image .",
    "as our sources are faint , refined positions are determined by centroiding on the star in each observation mosaic image .",
    "an aperture of three pixels radius is chosen in order to minimize noise from the sky and contamination from other sources in our relatively crowded fields . to get the total stellar flux , @xmath26 , our 3 pixel radius aperture photometry is corrected to the standard calibration aperture sizes per table  2 .",
    "table  2 includes the nominal wavelengths computed from equation ( [ lamo ] ) , the size of the standard reference aperture for each filter ( i.e. 10 pixels for irac and infinite for irsb and mips ) , the aperture correction needed to convert our three pixel photometry to the reference aperture size , and the references for the aperture corrections and instrumental - throughput spectral - response r vs. vacuum wavelengths .",
    "our aperture correction values for the irac photometry of hd165459 agree with the tabulated values from hora et  al .",
    "( 2008 ) to better than 0.25% , even though the hora background annulus is 1020 pixels instead of the 1220 pixels used by re05 for the standard 10 pixel photometry .",
    "the irac aperture correction from 10 pixels to infinity is discussed in  a.2 .",

    "our irac photometry from each image is corrected for distortions and pixel phase as recommended by hora et al .",
    "these corrections differ from re05 , who used a preliminary version of the hora et al .",

    "the remaining unexplained differences of up to 1.8% for irac3 must be due to the changing irac pipeline processing and/or a somewhat different selection of irac observations to include in the average for each star .",

    "higher extracted photometry implies lower calibration constants ; and the measured photometry differences correspond to the calibration constant differences to an accuracy of better than 1% .",
    "understanding that our differences with re05 are mostly due to differences in the photometry extracted from the irac images helps verify that both calibrations have been properly derived per the adopted common methodology and that our results are expected to be lower by about the amounts computed in table 4 for a+g stars .    while the calibration constants themselves depend directly on the accuracy of the bandpass throughput @xmath12 per equation ( [ favl ] ) or ( [ favnu ] ) , our methodology and that of re05 involve the same integral of the stellar sed over @xmath12 , so that errors in @xmath12 cancel to first order in the comparison of the two sets of results",

    "the discussion of our measures of instrumental response ( n ) appear above in  2.12.2",
    ", while this section covers the details of the flux ( f ) in the calibration constant p = f / n .    the essence of the _ hst _ flux system is to establish standard star seds and then measure other stars relative to these standard candles .",
    "pure hydrogen wd stars are chosen as these _ hst _ fundamental standard candles , because their atmospheric models are simpler than other stars where metal lines , molecular lines , and convection add complications .",
    "the models of our pure - hydrogen primary wd standards are specified by two parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 , both of which are defined by the balmer line profiles . to establish absolute flux standards , the unreddened wd stars g191b2b , gd71 , and gd153 are observed with stis , which also observed vega in the same modes with the same dispersion . because stis is precisely linear even into the regime of many times over - saturated in its ccd ( gilliland et  al . 1999 , bohlin & gilliland 2004 ) , the relative flux between vega and each wd is measured ( bohlin & gilliland 2004 ) ; and the well - known absolute monochromatic flux at 5556  for vega establishes the absolute flux of the model sed for each wd .",
    "minor complications arise due to the slowly changing stis sensitivity with time and the gradual loss of charge transfer efficiency in the ccd .",
    "these corrections are tracked to better than 1% , and the stis response is corrected for these effects as a function of wavelength .",
    "observations of the three fundamental primary wds establish the instrumental flux calibration .",
    "for example , a set of observations in the low dispersion modes of stis below 1   and from 0.82.5  in the grism modes of nicmos establish the flux calibrations and enables the creation of secondary flux standards .",

    "establishing proper uncertainties is a complex process , involving the division into categories of systematic and statistical errors , which can each be divided into sub - categories of absolute level and relative slope of flux vs. wavelength ( i.e. `` color '' ) . in many cases",
    ", the statistical scatter can be reduced below the systematic error bars by repeated observations or by binning spectra .",
    "systematic uncertainty of the _ hst _ wd flux scale is estimated as @xmath01% by b10 for the ratio of the flux at 5556  to fluxes in the 12.5 range .",
    "the total systematic uncertainty in our ir flux scale should be less than 2% , even when the 0.7% uncertainty in the absolute 5556  flux ( megessier 1995 ) is included .",
    "considerable confidence in the estimate of precision in the slope of the relative flux with wavelength can be gained by examining the internal agreement among the _ hst _ standards : i ) bohlin ( 2007a ) illustrates the @xmath391% agreement of the three primary wd models with their calibrated fluxes , which means that if the slope of any model , which depends primarily on @xmath35 , is in error , then the other two model temperatures must be similarly in error in order to make the same change in flux vs. wavelength for all three stars from 0.122.5  .",
    "ii ) the nicmos photometric calibration is based on the _ hst _ primary standard g191b2b and the secondary standard p330e per de jong ( 2006 ) , where the consistency of the absolute spectrophotometry is confirmed for these two seds from the calspec database . in particular , de jong s figure 2 shows an agreement of 0.81.4% between the nicmos calibrations derived from the seds for p330e and g191b2b over the combined 0.92.4  range of the three cameras .",
    "finally , the extrapolation of the _ hst _ nicmos fluxes from 2.2  to the first irac band at 3.6  is rather independent of the particular stellar model .",
    "for example , among the seven a stars in table 1 , bohlin & cohen ( 2008 ) demonstrate that all the measured nicmos seds fit their model seds over the 0.82.4  range within 1% in broad wavelength bins ; and the maximum difference in the 2.2/3.6  ratio is 0.7% between the minimum @xmath35=7650k model for 1743045 and the maximum 9100k model for 1802271 .      as discussed above , our measured irac instrumental responses are smaller than published by re05 for the same stars .",
    "however , re05 used data from the irac pipeline processing version s10 , while version s18.7.0 is utilized for this paper . to be directly comparable , any two independent calibrations should use the same pipeline processing version , as well as the same algorithms for extracting the point source fluxes from the images .    as discussed above and in the appendix , the equations that define our new calibrations are exactly equivalent to those of re05 , so that differences arise only from different measured instrumental photometry or from differences in the adopted stellar fluxes .",
    "the stellar fluxes used by re05 are from the cww grid , while the revised seds from bohlin & cohen ( 2008 ) are used here .",
    "some major differences in the derivation of model seds are that bohlin & cohen fitted models to nicmos spectrophotometry in the 0.8 - 2.4  range rather than to the 2mass plus i band photometry used for determining the cww seds .",
    "the ck04 model grid was used to fit the data ; and rather than specifying the model @xmath35 and @xmath36 from spectral classification spectra , bohlin & cohen found the best fitting model from the grid , allowing @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and the reddening e(b - v ) to vary as free parameters . despite these differences ,",
    "the resulting seds differ only slightly from the ccw fluxes used by re05 .",
    "for example over the irac 39  range , our seds for the irac primary stars hd165469 and 1812095 agree with the cww seds used by re05 to 0.5 and 12% , respectively .",
    "ri08 start by determining a best calibrated value for an equivalent vega photospheric flux at 10.6  and use a vega theoretical model normalized to this value to predict the photospheric flux density at 2.22 .",
    "this prediction is robust against different models for a0 star photospheres .",
    "after correction for the small contribution for the extended debris ring found in interferometry , the resulting prediction is compared with measurements of the absolute flux density from vega near 2.22 .",
    "the agreement is good ; and the two approaches are averaged to generate a best a - star - based calibration at 2.22 .",
    "ri08 independently generated a calibrated solar spectrum as a combination of the measurements of thuillier et al .",
    "( 2003 ) out to 2.4 and an engelke function from 2.4 to 12  ( over which range the engelke function gives a good fit to a number of accurate calibrated solar measurements ) .",
    "ri08 use this spectrum to compare with the observed k-[8 ] color of solar - type stars and extrapolated the result to 10.6  for an independent test of the beginning calibration at this wavelength .",
    "their calibration makes no reference to the visible calibration , although the predicted color of vega based on the absolute calibrations at v and k is consistent with the observed color of the star to within about 2% .",
    "the v - k colors of solar - type stars are also consistent roughly within this error with their calibration at 2.22  using the thuillier measurements to translate to v. the ri08 results should be understood as a purely infrared - based calibration with an estimated accuracy in this region of 2% .",
    "the ri08 calibration suggests that the irac4 8  fluxes should be 1.5 @xmath12% higher , while our fluxes are @xmath00.5% lower than re05 .",
    "thus , our results agree with ri08 within the uncertainties .",
    "a new extraction of the irac photometry for the 32 ri08 stars compared with the ri08 tabulation of predicted fluxes produces a mean predicted - to - observed ratio that is 2.1  @xmath10.5% above unity , i.e. confirming the ri08 difference of 1.5% within the uncertainties .",
    "the following points compare the ri08 technique to the similar _ hst _ and cww methods for establishing standard star seds .",
    "\\i ) ri08 establish two independent ir absolute flux determinations for a stars ( vega ) and for g stars ( the sun ) , for which agreement provides a powerful confirmation of the results .",
    "both the _ hst _ and cww absolute levels are traceable only to the visible range for vega .",
    "\\ii ) in the ri08 method , a large number of flux standards are more easily and cheaply established from existing accurate photometric systems , so that statistical uncertainties can be reduced well below systematic uncertainties .",
    "the other methods are more observationally expensive , especially in the case of the _ hst _ flux measurements .",
    "\\iii ) because of the similarity of seds at long wavelengths , errors between widely separated ir wavelengths are minimal .",
    "ri08 normalized the adopted seds to ir absolute flux measurements , so that errors in the ir are minimized .",
    "\\iv ) the shape of stellar seds short of 1.5  becomes increasingly dependent on the stellar temperature and on the metallicity .",
    "thus , the uncertainty of the flux calibration below 1.5  grows with decreasing wavelength making the ri08 technique less useful for calibration in the short wavelength ( 0.6 - 1.5  ) range of jwst .",
    "several deficiencies in our prototype set of flux standards must be addressed before _",
    "jwst _ can be calibrated to our goal of 1% precision at 0.630  .",
    "required improvements include i ) better stellar atmosphere grids and a better understanding of their uncertainties , ii ) updated and expanded lists of potential standard stars in each of our three spectral type classes , and iii ) resolution of the proper normalization of these models to measures of absolute stellar fluxes in the visible and ir .",
    "perhaps , the best way to assess systematic errors within a set of similar type stars is to compare independent sets of models to the measured flux distributions , which b10 did for the g stars by fitting both marcs models ( gustafsson et al .",
    "2008 ) and those of ck04 . in broad continuum bins ,",
    "both sets of models agree with the _ hst _ fluxes to @xmath00.5% .",
    "however , both of these sets have serious deficiencies .",
    "the marcs grid does not extend past 20  , while the ck04 grid has rather coarse wavelength spacing with a total of 1221 points and only one point between 10 and 40  @xmath6 m . a third independent model grid ,",
    "an update of the ck04 models with good wavelength resolution , and an extension of the marcs grid beyond its current 20  limit would be ideal .",
    "shortward of 20  , the best - fit ck04 models agree with the best - fit marcs models to 1% for the g stars in broad continuum bands . combining this 1% with a 1% systematic uncertainty in the _ hst _ wd flux scale results in the b10 estimate of a possible systematic 2% uncertainty of the broadband ir fluxes of individual g stars with respect to the v band .    for the a stars ,",
    "a second independent model grid is needed , because the marcs models are limited to maximum temperatures of 8000k .",
    "both the original cww seds and the newer bohlin & cohen ( 2008 ) seds are extrapolations of the measured fluxes into the ir using models that are based on computer code traceable to r. kurucz .",
    "the best check on these ir fluxes of the a stars was from the two models provided by t. lanz at 9400  k and 8020  k. while the agreement of the lanz sed with ck04 is within 2% for the 9400  k model , the lanz sed is brighter than ck04 by 4% at 10  for the 8020  k model , which raises the question of the accuracy of model seds , in general .",
    "because of the scatter among the wds and because only two g stars are included , our results are based mainly on a stars .",
    "furthermore , the final re05 irac calibration is based entirely on a stars , so that more work on independent a star grids is essential .",
    "our goal of comparing results among different stellar types is compromised by the large scatter and offset of the average results for the wds and by the poor significance of the g - star result that is based on only two stars .",
    "perhaps , warm - mission irac1 and irac2 observations of our four wd stars could illuminate the reality of their large scatter in the top panel of figure  [ fig5 ] . among the a stars ,",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows the most scatter at 8  , where 1740346 is excluded because of evidence for dust at 16  .",
    "however , 1805292 has a 3@xmath31 deviation without a strong indication for dust .",
    "thus , more a stars would reduce uncertainties , especially with respect to the pure a - star calibration of re05 . the remaining two primary and primary - candidate a star standards of re05",
    "should be observed with stis and modeled to achieve a more complete and precise comparison between the _ hst _ and re05 a - star results .    in order to confirm the a star comparison with irac , more g stars and more wd stars with good existing cold mission _",
    "observations are needed .",
    "plenty of observations of brighter stars with both irac and mips 24  exist in the spitzer archives , except for wds .",
    "thus , the wd category will be supplemented by late o or b type stars .",
    "this new set of standards is also needed to cover the large dynamic range and spectral variety required to calibrate the full suite of jwst instrumentation but will require new stis spectrophotometry to provide the link to _",
    "acs photometry , wfc3 photometry , and wfc3 grism spectrophotometry will also help in firmly establishing the tie to the _ hst _ flux scale , especially for the wfc3 data at wavelengths longward of the stis cutoff at 1 .",
    "while the absolute - flux zero - point of all _ hst _ standards is tied to the monochromatic value of flux for vega of @xmath2  erg @xmath3 s@xmath4  @xmath4 at 5556    ( megessier 1995 ) , there are valid absolute measures in the ir , as summarized by ri08 .",
    "because ri08 discuss and present a sed for vega , the differences between our preferred vega sed and the ri08 sed are investigated as a possible explanation for the differences between the _ hst _ and ri08 flux calibrations for irac .",
    "the sed of vega has been measured by stis at 0.171  @xmath6 m by bohlin & gilliland ( 2004 ) , who suggested that the kurucz @xmath40  k model fits the stis observations , while bohlin ( 2007a ) discovered that a change in the stis non - linearity correction made a kurucz 9400  k model@xmath41 fit the observed flux much better both below the balmer jump and in the 0.70.8  @xmath6 m region , as illustrated in figure  [ fig6 ] with red for the 9550  k and green for the 9400  k models .",
    "these two models and the reference continuum level are all normalized to @xmath2  erg @xmath3 s@xmath4  @xmath4 at 5556    ( megessier 1995 ) .",
    "the blue line is the same 9550  k model but is normalized to the ri08 ir value of 645jy @xmath12.3% at 2.22  @xmath6 m .",
    "the ri08 fluxes below 1  are not expected to match the actual stellar flux and are not shown .",
    "the division of all the seds by the same smooth theoretical model continuum in figure  [ fig6 ] illustrates the differences among the various flux distributions and also shows where the ( mostly hydrogen ) line blanketing complicates the comparisons .",
    "the stis measurements ( black line in figure  [ fig6 ] ) and the 9400  k model ( green line ) agree to @xmath01% in the unblanketed regions from below the balmer jump to @xmath01  @xmath6 m .",
    "fortunately , the discrepancy of 1.1% at 2.22  @xmath6 m between the _ hst _ based fluxes and ri08 is almost negligible and could be reduced by using the 9400  k model with a weighted average of the visible and ir normalizations .",
    "another complication is that vega is a pole - on rapid rotator ( peterson et  al .",
    "2006 ) with temperature zones in the 790010150  k range ( aufdenberg et  al .",
    "even though the line blanketing in the aufdenberg et  al .",
    "multi - temperature model is occasionally stronger than measured , the continuum levels of his computed pole - on sed ( aufdenberg , private comm . )",
    "track the ratio of the 5556     to the 2.22  absolute fluxes to 0.4% , i.e. much better than any uncertainties in the absolute flux measurements in the visible or ir . in summary",
    ", there is no reason to question the accuracy of either the 5556    flux of megessier ( 1995 ) or the 2.22  flux quoted by ri08 .",
    "a robust and straightforward comparison of a model sed for vega with the measured absolute visible and ir fluxes is not possible because of the ir emission from the dust ring and because vega is a pole - on rapid rotator . as pointed out by cohen et  al .",
    "( 1992b ) , sirius is a much better primary ir standard because of its low rotation speed and lack of a contaminating dust ring .",
    "thus , one big step forward in resolving any possible offset between visible and ir absolute fluxes is to observe sirius with stis and fit a model , in order to directly compare the model with ir absolute fluxes , eg . from msx ( price et  al .",
    "2004 ) , who have @xmath01% measurement accuracy in six bands from 4.3 to 21.3  .",
    "stis spectrophotometry of sirius will be somewhat more saturated than for vega ; but the same techniques of bohlin & gilliland ( 2004 ) for precisely analyzing saturated data should apply .    on longer time scales , there are on - going programs to measure stellar spectrophotometric fluxes relative to nist laboratory standards .",
    "the access rocket program will establish a few fundamental flux standards in the brightness range of sirius to v@xmath09.5 ( kaiser et  al .",
    "a ground - based program , nist stars , is supported by lidar to measure the real - time atmospheric extinction and uses nist calibrated detectors to establish an all - sky set of seds for standard stars with precisions of 0.5% ( zimmer et  al .",
    "the irac calibration constants have been determined from a somewhat different set of flux standards than utilized by re05 .",
    "small differences between our results and those of re05 are explained by differences in the photometry extracted from the irac images .",
    "our results are in agreement with the independent irac4 8  calibration of ri08 .",
    "the robustness of our results suffer from a deficiency of g - star flux standards , from the exclusion of two out of the four re05 primary flux standards , and from offsets of up to 4@xmath31 between our set of wd stars and the cooler standards . to alleviate these deficiencies , more comparison standards with",
    "_ hst _ fluxes and better model grids are required to model the measured fluxes and establish seds to the jwst limit of 30  .",
    "the _ hst _ method of flux calibration for filter photometry does not involve color corrections or nominal wavelengths and is always defined in terms of the photon weighted mean flux over the bandpass in wavelength units @xmath42 or in frequency units @xmath43 ( koornneef et  al .",
    "1986 , ri08 ) , because detectors are generally photon detection devices , rather than total energy sensing bolometers .",
    "some authors , ( e.g. bessel , et  al .",
    "1998 & cohen , et  al . 2003 ) , define our product @xmath44 as their response function of the system .",
    "source independent calibration constants @xmath45 are defined by dividing the mean flux by the predicted electrons s@xmath4 , @xmath11 , in an infinite - radius aperture .",
    "if the predicted @xmath11 from equation ( [ ne ] ) is substituted in equations ( [ favl]-[favnu ] ) , @xmath46 @xmath47 because the _ hst _ standard flux units are normally per unit wavelength , the constant @xmath48 appears in the headers of _ hst _ photometric images with the keyword name @xmath49 .",
    "for some instruments , e.g. nicmos , @xmath50 with the keyword name @xmath51 is also included in the headers .",
    "the re05 calibration constant in frequency units per equations ( [ fnu ] ) and ( [ k ] ) is @xmath52 after substituting the definition of @xmath53 from equation ( [ lamo ] ) with @xmath54 and simplifying , the result is @xmath55 , i.e. the _ hst _ and the re05 methodologies produce exactly the same calibration constants @xmath56 .",
    "the _ hst _ calibration constants are normally derived from the source independent equations ( [ pl][pnu ] ) after any required adjustments are made to the @xmath12 estimated from the product of laboratory component qe measurements .",
    "these adjustments are derived by making the measured @xmath13 in an infinite aperture match the predicted @xmath11 calculated from equation ( [ ne ] ) . in practice ,",
    "a radius of something like the 5.5  for acs is defined as `` infinite '' ( sirianni et  al . 2005 , bohlin 2007b ) ; and the primary pure hydrogen wds g191b2b , gd71 , and gd153 are the preferred standards used for @xmath57 in equation ( [ ne ] ) .",
    "conversely for flux calibrated images as is the case for the _ spitzer _ data , the measured @xmath13 can be calculated from the measured mean - photometric flux as @xmath58 .",
    "this reconciliation of laboratory component throughputs versus the truth of standard stars is achieved by adjusting the normalization of the filter throughput or even by changing the quantum efficiency , qe , as function of wavelength for the detector or filter when sufficient information exists ( e.g. de marchi , et  al .",
    "2004 , bohlin 2007b ) .",
    "thus , information about individual component throughputs , such as the telescope or detector qe , may be inferred when there are multiple filters sampling the same wavelength regions .    to complement the above estimates of mean flux for stars imaged in a particular filter ,",
    "an associated wavelength is often useful .",
    "in addition to the nominal wavelength @xmath30 of re05 , other common definitions are the @xmath59 and @xmath60 wavelengths .",

    "appendix e of ri08 contains our definition for mean wavelength but has an alternative formula for a band width .",
    "the ri08 definition of nominal wavelength is photon weighted as in re05 but is an integral over wavelength in contrast to the re05 integral over frequency .",
    "also discussed in ri08 is the concept of isophotal wavelength .",
    "one complication in the comparison of the _ hst _ and re05 flux calibration methodologies is that the above discussion is for the flux calibration of a point source , while the spitzer images are calibrated in terms of surface brightness i. if a calibration constants @xmath70 is defined so that multiplication by the original dn / s produces i , then @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the size of a pixel in steradians , g is the gain in electrons / dn , and the data number ( dn ) is the unit of the instrumental signal .",
    "another small complication is that the published values c of re05 for the surface brightness calibration are adjusted for an absolute calibration based on a ten pixel radius for stellar photometry and require the correction to the infinite - aperture @xmath73 .",
    "values for @xmath74 are listed in re05 as 0.944 , 0.937 , 0.772 , and 0.737 for irac channels 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 , respectively , and may have large uncertainties because of complications caused by the small format and the internal scattering in the si : as array .",
    "these values appear in table 5 along with a selection of other calibration parameters , including _ photflam _ and _ photfnu _ , the _ hst _ style calibration constants .",
    "the top two rows of table 5 are the published calibration constants from the _ spitzer _ instrumental references in our _ introduction_. the row labeled `` r - corr . '' in table 5 is the correction factor to the published _ spitzer _",

    "the @xmath50 values are from re05 and applying the tabulated r - corr to the published throughput r curves makes the irac calibration self - consistent .",
    "any change to an adopted calibration constant requires a corresponding change to the absolute level of that filter s r curve to maintain internal consistency .",
    "the r - corr factors have poor precision for irsb with its linearity problem and for mips with only three stars .",
    "because the effective wavelength depends on the stellar sed , table 5 includes examples for our hottest star g191b2b and a cooler star p330e ; however , the differences are insignificant , because the slopes of the two seds are nearly the same in the ir .",
    "the flux weighting makes the @xmath76 values smaller than the other measures of wavelength .",
    "the irsb relative response , r , has been divided by 3.58 to make the irsb system throughput comparable to the other five modes and bring the values into agreement with fig . 6.1 in the irs data handbook , where the peak qe is shown at a reasonable peak value of 0.81 . without this adjustment of 3.58",
