    "understanding the origin of the star - to - star abundance variations of the light elements in globular clusters is one of the major challenges confronting stellar evolution , stellar nucleosynthesis and chemical evolution .",
    "arguably the first evidence for chemical abundance inhomogeneity in a globular cluster was the discovery of a cn strong star in m13 by @xcite .",
    "a large number of subsequent studies have confirmed the star - to - star variation in the strength of the cn molecular bands in a given globular cluster , and these results have been extended to star - to - star abundance variations for the light elements  li , c , n , o , f , na , mg and al ( e.g. , see reviews by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) . in light of the discovery of abundance variations in unevolved stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the consensus view is that these light element abundance variations are attributed to a proto - cluster environment in which the gas was of an inhomogeneous composition . the interstellar medium from which some of the stars formed included material processed through hydrogen - burning at high temperatures .",
    "the source of that material and the nature of the nucleosynthesis , however , remain highly contentious with intermediate - mass asymptotic giant branch stars , fast rotating massive stars and massive binaries being the leading candidates ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "recent discoveries of complex structure in colour - magnitude diagrams reveal that most , if not all , globular clusters host multiple populations ; the evidence consists of multiple main sequences , subgiant branches , red giant branches and/or horizontal branches in galactic ( e.g. , see @xcite for a review ) and also extragalactic globular clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "when using appropriate photometric filters , all globular clusters show well - defined sequences with distinct chemical abundance patterns @xcite",
    ". these multiple populations can be best explained by different ages and/or chemical compositions .",
    "the sequence of events leading to the formation of multiple population globular clusters is not well understood ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "although the census and characterization of the galactic globular clusters remains incomplete , they may be placed into three general categories : ( @xmath5 ) those that exhibit only light element abundance variations , which include ngc 6397 , ngc 6752 and 47  tuc ( e.g. , @xcite ) , ( @xmath6 ) those that exhibit light element abundance variations and neutron - capture element abundance dispersions such as m15 ( e.g. , @xcite ) and ( @xmath7 ) those that exhibit light element abundance variations as well as significant abundance dispersions for fe - peak elements ) .",
    "] such as @xmath8 cen , m22 , m54 , ngc 1851 , ngc 3201 and terzan 5 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . at this stage",
    ", we do not attempt to classify a particularly unusual system like ngc 2419 @xcite .    given the surprisingly large star - to - star variations in element abundance ratios in a given cluster , how chemically homogeneous are the `` well - behaved '' elements in the `` normal '' globular clusters ( i.e. , clusters in category ( @xmath5 ) above ) ?",
    "the answer to this question has important consequences for testing model predictions , setting constraints on the polluters and understanding the origin and evolution of globular clusters .",
    "@xcite considered the issue of cluster abundance accuracy limits and selected the [ ni / fe ] ratio as an example .",
    "this pair of elements was chosen as they present numerous spectral lines in the `` uncomplicated yellow - red region '' of the spectrum and share `` common nucleosynthetic origins in supernovae '' .",
    "@xcite noted that the dispersion in the [ ni / fe ] ratio in a cluster was @xmath00.06  dex and appeared to show `` little apparent trend as a function of the number of stars observed in a survey or of year of publication '' .",
    "there are two possible reasons for the apparent limit in the @xmath9[ni / fe ] ratio .",
    "perhaps clusters possess a single [ ni / fe ] ratio and the dispersion reflects the measurement uncertainties . alternatively ,",
    "globular clusters are chemically homogeneous in the [ ni / fe ] ratio at the @xmath00.06  dex level .",
    "bearing in mind this apparent limit in the [ ni / fe ] dispersion , in order to answer the question posed above , we require the highest possible precision when measuring chemical abundances .    a number of recent studies have achieved precision in chemical abundance measurements as low as 0.01  dex ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these results were obtained by using ( @xmath5 ) high quality spectra ( r @xmath10 60,000 and signal - to - noise ratios s / n @xmath10 200 per pixel ) , ( @xmath6 ) a strictly differential line - by - line analysis and ( @xmath7 ) a well - chosen sample of stars covering a small range in stellar parameters ( effective temperature , surface gravity , metallicity ) .",
    "application of similar analysis techniques to high quality spectra of stars in globular clusters offers the hope that high precision chemical abundance measurements ( at the @xmath00.01 dex level ) can also be obtained . to our knowledge ,",
    "the highest precision chemical abundance measurements in globular clusters to date are at the @xmath00.04 dex level include @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to achieve high precision abundance measurements in the globular cluster ngc 6752 and to use these data to study the chemical enrichment history of this cluster .",
    "the targets for this study were taken from the @xmath11 photometry by @xcite .",
    "the sample consists of 17 stars located near the tip of the red giant branch ( hereafter rgb tip stars ) and 21 stars located at the bump in the luminosity function along the rgb ( hereafter rgb bump stars ) .",
    "the list of targets can be found in table [ tab : param ] .",
    "observations were performed using the ultraviolet and visual echelle spectrograph ( uves ; @xcite ) on the 8.2 m kueyen ( vlt / ut2 ) telescope at cerro paranal , chile .",
    "the rgb tip stars were observed at a resolving power of r = 110,000 and s / n @xmath10 150 per pixel near 5140  while the rgb bump stars were observed at r = 60,000 and s / n @xmath10 100 per pixel near 5140 .",
    "analyses of these spectra have been reported in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the location of the program stars in a colour - magnitude diagram can be found in figure 1 in @xcite .    [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      + in order to place the above values onto an absolute scale , the absolute abundances we obtain for the reference stars are given below .",
    "we caution , however , that the absolute scale has not been critically evaluated ( see section 2.5 for more details ) .",
    "+ ngc6752-mg9 : a(pr ) = @xmath120.75 ,",
    "a(nd ) = @xmath120.02 , a(sm ) = @xmath120.38 , a(eu ) = @xmath120.69 , a(dy ) = @xmath120.25    for these new measurements , we fit the slope to @xmath13 vs.@xmath14 as in section 3.2 .",
    "we find that the slope is positive for all elements .",
    "if we remove the abundance trends with @xmath15  as described in section 3.4 , these results remain unchanged . for y , la ,",
    "nd , and eu , the results from this new analysis are in agreement with the previous results ( at the @xmath163@xmath9 level ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : ncaprat ] , we plot the slope of the fit to @xmath13 vs.  @xmath14 against the percentage attributed to the @xmath17-process in the solar system , adopting the solar @xmath17-process percentages calculated by @xcite . in this figure , we also show the slopes when fitting @xmath18 vs.  @xmath19 , i.e. , after removing the abundance trends with @xmath15 . in both cases ,",
    "the slopes are not of high statistical significance , @xmath162@xmath9 level . if we exclude y , a possible outlier , the slopes are of even lower statistical significance , @xmath161@xmath9 .",
    "( the neighboring elements y and zr are both members of the first @xmath17-process peak , so we would not expect their nucleosynthesis histories to be substantially different . )",
    "the absence of a significant trend in figure [ fig : ncaprat ] suggests that the abundance variations are not the result of preferentially introducing more @xmath17-process material than @xmath20-process material .     vs.  @xmath14 vs.percentage attributed to the @xmath17-process in solar system material ( using the @xcite values ) .",
    "the red squares are from the `` regular '' analysis while the blue open circles are fits to the data when abundance trends with @xmath15  have been removed , i.e. , slopes of the fits to @xmath18 vs.  @xmath21 .",
    "small horizontal offsets ( @xmath22  0.5% ) have been applied to aid visibility . neither slope is significant at the 2@xmath9 level . ]",
    "the correlation between ca and na requires massive stars to have played a role in the pre- or proto - cluster environment since the synthesis of ca is believed to occur primarily during o - burning and si - burning in those objects @xcite .",
    "that said , the abundances for all elements are positively correlated with the na abundance , and for any pair of elements heavier than si , the abundances are positively correlated .",
    "furthermore , the ratios for any pair of elements ( e.g. , @xmath23 @xmath12 @xmath24 using our terminology ) are constant at the 0.036 dex @xmath22 0.001 dex ( @xmath9 = 0.012 ) level for the rgb tip sample ( excluding eu , which has considerably larger measurement errors ) and essentially identical results are found for the rgb bump sample .",
    "thus , the origin of such correlations demands a source ( or sources ) capable of synthesis of na , @xmath4 , fe - peak and neutron - capture elements and this diverse suite of elements must be synthesized in essentially equal amounts .",
    "no individual star can achieve such nucleosynthesis , and therefore , a variety of sources is required .",
    "the underlying assumption in this work , and in other studies , is that the star - to - star light element abundance variations in mono - metallic globular clusters are produced by some source ( agb , frms and/or massive binaries ) within the duration of star formation in the globular cluster .",
    "such an assumption appears reasonable , although unresolved issues related to nucleosynthesis and enrichment timescales remain ( e.g. , @xcite ) . regarding the heavy elements",
    ", one might also assume that the star - to - star abundance variations and correlations with na are produced by some source within the duration of star formation in this globular cluster , provided the heavy elements are produced in the same ratios as those already found in the first generation stars .",
    "another possibility is that the heavy element abundance variations and correlations with na arise because the ejecta from the source that produced na was diluted into gas with slightly higher [ x / h ] ratios that entered the cluster while the later generations of stars formed . in this scenario ,",
    "production of the light elements , including na , is completely decoupled from production of all elements heavier than si .",
    "unfortunately , there are no obvious observational tests to distinguish between these two scenarios .",
    "we thus regard the `` production during cluster formation '' and `` dilution with pristine material '' scenarios as equally valid possibilities for the abundance variations .    the penultimate issue we raise concerns whether the distribution of the heavy element abundances is discrete or continuous .",
    "as noted in section 2.1 , @xcite have identified three stellar populations in ngc 6752 based on _ hst _ and ground - based str \" omgren photometry .",
    "the three populations can be found at all evolutionary stages ( main sequence , subgiant branch and red giant branch ) . additionally , each population exhibits distinct chemical abundance patterns for the light elements ( e.g. , n , o , na , mg and al ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : fena ] , populations @xmath1 ( green ) , @xmath25 ( magenta ) and @xmath26 ( blue ) have distinct @xmath14 abundances . in figures [ fig : sica ] and [ fig : nind ] ( and other figures ) , we use the same colour scheme to denote the three populations . in general ,",
    "population @xmath26 ( blue ) exhibits a larger ( i.e. , more positive ) value for @xmath13 than population @xmath1 ( green ) , while population @xmath25 ( magenta ) lies between populations @xmath1 and @xmath26 .",
    "such a result is expected given ( @xmath5 ) the na abundances of each population and ( @xmath6 ) the correlation between @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "although we have achieved very high precision relative abundance measurements , it is not clear whether the abundance distributions seen in figures [ fig : sica ] and [ fig : nind ] are consistent with three discrete values in the @xmath27 vs. @xmath28 plane , corresponding to the @xcite populations @xmath1 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "( that said , it is not obvious whether the @xcite data show three discrete photometric sequences . )",
    "additional studies may be necessary to clarify whether the heavy element abundance distribution is discrete or continuous in this globular cluster .    finally , we mentioned in the introduction that @xcite examined the [ ni / fe ] ratio in the context of cluster abundance accuracy limits .",
    "there was an apparent limit in @xmath9[ni / fe ] at the @xmath00.06 dex level .",
    "for the rgb tip and rgb bump samples , we find @xmath9(@xmath23 @xmath12 @xmath29 ) = 0.009 and 0.010 , respectively , thereby highlighting the great improvement in abundance precision that can be obtained when conducting a strictly differential analysis of high quality spectra .",
    "we have obtained very high precision chemical abundance measurements , @xmath13 , through a strictly differential analysis of high quality uves spectra of giant stars in the globular cluster ngc 6752 .",
    "the measurement uncertainties and average uncertainties for a given element , @xmath30 , are as low as @xmath00.01 dex .",
    "the observed abundance dispersions , and abundance dispersions about various linear fits ( e.g. , @xmath13 vs.  @xmath15  or @xmath13 vs.  @xmath28 ) , are often considerably larger than the average abundance uncertainty .",
    "we find positive correlations between any given element and na , i.e. , @xmath13 vs.  @xmath14 , and indeed for any combination of elements , e.g. , @xmath13 vs.  @xmath28 .",
    "these correlations are often of high statistical significance ( @xmath31 5@xmath9 ) , although we note that the amplitudes of the abundance variations are small .",
    "these results are unchanged even after removing abundance trends with @xmath15  and/or when using a different pair of reference stars .",
    "indeed , the likelihood of these results being due to random error is exceedingly small .",
    "therefore , we argue that there is a genuine abundance dispersion in this cluster , at the @xmath00.03 dex level .    in order to explain these results , we consider four possibilities .",
    "the abundance variations and correlations may reflect ( @xmath5 ) systematic errors in the stellar parameters , ( @xmath6 ) star - to - star cno abundance variations , ( @xmath7 ) star - to - star he abundance variations and/or ( @xmath32 ) inhomogeneous chemical evolution . in the context of point ( @xmath5 )",
    ", the stellar parameter uncertainties would require substantial increases ; our results are seen for all elements ( covering a range of ionization potentials and ionization states ) and no single change in @xmath15 , @xmath33  or @xmath34  would remove the abundance correlations for all elements . regarding point ( @xmath6 ) , predictions by @xcite suggest that for weak lines such as those in this study , using model atmospheres with appropriate cno abundances will not change our results . regarding point ( @xmath7 ) , for a fixed mass fraction of metals ( @xmath35 ) , an increase in helium abundance ( @xmath36 ) would result in a lower hydrogen abundance ( @xmath37 ) and therefore a higher metal - to - hydrogen ratio , @xmath35/@xmath37 . since na and he abundances are expected to be correlated , the positive correlations we find between @xmath13 vs.  @xmath14 are consistent with a he abundance variation ( for constant @xmath35 ) .",
    "given the current constraints on @xmath3 from photometry @xcite , it is likely that the abundance variations can not be attributed solely to he .",
    "nevertheless , he abundance variations probably play an important role in producing the abundance variations that we find . concerning point ( @xmath32 ) ,",
    "the correlation between si and na could arise from leakage from the mg - al chain into si in either agb or frms .",
    "for the neutron - capture elements , there is no significant trend between the slope of the fit to @xmath13 vs.  @xmath14 when plotted against percentage attributed to the @xmath17-process in solar system material .",
    "thus , their abundance variations are probably not related to @xmath17-process production by whatever source produced the light element variations . that all elements are correlated requires a nucleosynthetic source(s ) capable of synthesizing na , @xmath4 , fe - peak and neutron - capture elements",
    ". additionally , element - to - element ratios ( e.g. , @xmath23 @xmath12 @xmath24 using our terminology ) are constant at the @xmath00.03 dex level .",
    "no individual object can achieve the required nucleosynthesis .",
    "we can not ascertain whether the heavy elements were produced ( @xmath1 ) within the duration of star formation in this globular cluster or ( @xmath25 ) by dilution of na - rich material into gas with slightly higher [ x / h ] ratios that entered the cluster while the second ( and later ) generations of stars formed . in summary , our results",
    "may be explained by some combination of he abundance variations and inhomogeneous chemical evolution ( i.e. , metallicity variations ) .",
    "there may be other explanations for the observed abundance variations and correlations .",
