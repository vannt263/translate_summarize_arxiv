    "the ginsparg - wilson relation ( gwr ) for a lattice dirac operator @xmath0 reads @xcite @xmath1 we choose @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 , hence the gwr simplifies to @xmath5 it guarantees an exact  though lattice modified  chiral symmetry in even dimensions @xcite , and parity symmetry in odd dimensions @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the anomaly arises from the measure .",
    "given some dirac operator @xmath6 ( local , no doublers ) , we can enforce the gwr on @xmath7 by the overlap formula @xmath8 , so that @xmath9 obeys the gwr ( for @xmath10 in some allowed interval ) .",
    "the standard neuberger fermion uses the wilson operator @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the guide - line for our concept to _ improve _ overlap fermions @xcite is the following observation : if @xmath6 is already a gw fermion ( with respect to a fixed kernel @xmath12 ) , then @xmath13 . we can explicitly construct an approximate solution to the gwr , use it as @xmath6 , and then we expect that the overlap formula only causes a small `` chiral correction '' , @xmath14 therefore , we first construct a short - ranged approximate gw fermion , which includes elements of a truncated perfect action , and then we insert it as @xmath6 into the overlap formula . the resulting @xmath15 has an exact chiral symmetry , and we expect a high level of _ locality _ , good scaling and approximate rotation invariance , because these properties hold for @xmath6 , and we rely on relation ( [ chicor ] ) .",
    "moreover , we predict a _ fast convergence _ under iterative evaluation of @xmath15 , because we start off in the right vicinity .",
    "all these properties have been tested and confirmed in the 2-flavour schwinger model @xcite . here",
    "we report on convergence and locality in quenched qcd .",
    "our construction of a short - ranged approximate gw fermion is based on the perfect free fermion @xcite , which is truncated to a unit hypercube .",
    "it consists of a vector term and a scalar term , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 , @xmath18 only for @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "the couplings are given in ref .",
    "the first step is a `` minimal gauging '' of this hf , which means that the free couplings are attached to the shortest lattice paths only .",
    "this formulation provides already an excellent rotation behaviour , but it suffers from strong additive mass renormalization @xcite .    to cure this problem , we attach a `` link amplification factor '' @xmath21 to each link and tune it to @xmath22 to approach at the chiral limit .",
    "using different factors for the vector term and the scalar term further improves the gw approximation .",
    "next we add a fat link , i.e. each link variable is substituted by a linear combination : @xmath23 `` direct link '' + @xmath24 @xmath25 `` staple terms '' .",
    "finally we also include a clover term . with this modest set of parameters",
    "we optimize the qcd spectrum at @xmath26 . in ref .",
    "@xcite we show the full spectrum for typical configurations on a @xmath27 lattice , as well as the eigenvalues with the least real parts on a @xmath28 lattice .",
    "we consider two ways to evaluate the overlap dirac operator by means of polynomial expansions , which have appeared in the literature .",
    "+ 1 ) we introduce the hermitean operator @xmath29 , and evaluate @xmath30 the last term corresponds to a sign function @xmath31 @xmath32 for @xmath33 @xmath34 , which is approximated by a polynomial .",
    "+ 2 ) we simply expand @xmath35 by a polynomial , and insert @xmath36 for @xmath37 .",
    "for the sign expansion , the convergence in the degree of the polynomial is exponential , if @xmath38 $ ] .",
    "hence we first re - scale @xmath39 , so that the spectrum @xmath40 $ ] . what matters is the density of eigenvalues ( evs ) of @xmath41 around 0 , where the polynomial converges most painfully due to the discontinuity . for the hf",
    ", @xmath42 has two peaks around @xmath43 , which are shifted slightly towards the origin for @xmath41 , leaving typically ( at @xmath26 ) a wide gap without evs of @xmath41 between about @xmath44 $ ] . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath45 has a broad spectrum , ranging from about @xmath46 $ ] , and after re - scaling one does obtains evs near 0 .",
    "histograms are shown in ref .",
    "@xcite .    for the @xmath35 expansion",
    "the situation is similar : here we re - scale so that @xmath47 $ ] , @xmath48 .",
    "it is crucial that @xmath49 ( the lower bound of the re - scaled spectrum ) does not become very small ; getting close to the singularity slows down the convergence .",
    "again , the wilson spectrum is very broad to start with , and re - scaling usually leads to small @xmath49 , whereas it is kept larger for the hf .    in fig .",
    "[ fig - conv ] we illustrate the convergence rate in qcd at @xmath26 using chebyshev polynomials .",
    "[ fig - conv ]    as an example , we discuss the @xmath50 expansion on the @xmath27 lattice . for @xmath51 ,",
    "the maximal ( mean ) deviation of the evs of @xmath52 from the unit circle in @xmath53 ( with center 1 ) behaves typically as @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) ) , where @xmath56 is the degree of the chebyshev polynomials .",
    "the corresponding decays for @xmath57 amount to @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "if we fix some affordable degree @xmath56 , the precision of the gw approximation is superior for the hf by a factor @xmath60 , which takes a very considerable magnitude for realistic numbers like @xmath61 .    on the other hand , we could fix a certain accuracy @xmath62 which we consider necessary , so the required degree @xmath56 compares as @xmath63 . referring to this number , the computational overhead of the hf , which amounts to a factor @xmath64 , is compensated in part .",
    "it now takes only a relatively small progress in the scaling behaviour to make up for the remaining overhead .",
    "[ fig - loc ] shows that locality is clearly improved for the overlap - hf compared to the neuberger fermion . following ref .",
    "@xcite , we measure the `` maximal correlation '' @xmath65 over a distance @xmath66 .",
    "[ fig - loc ]    we stay on the @xmath67 lattice and we observe also here a clear progress in the speed of convergence .",
    "this is related to the condition number @xmath68 , i.e.  the ratio of the upper and the lower bound of the spectrum of @xmath36 .",
    "[ fig - cond ] ( on top ) shows that the improved condition number for the hf is essentially due to the _ decrease of the upper bound_. to illustrate the effect of @xmath68 on the convergence rate , fig .",
    "[ fig - cond ] ( below ) shows the deviation of @xmath69 from the precise result if we use a moderate polynomial of degree @xmath70 .",
    "this deviation depends smoothly on @xmath68 , up to an extra gap which makes the deviation for @xmath51 yet a bit worse than @xmath68 suggests , even at the optimal parameter @xmath71 .",
    "[ fig - cond ]",
    "compared to the standard neuberger fermion , the overlap - hf gains significantly in the convergence rate under polynomial evaluation .",
    "we have studied the evolution of the full operator in the polynomial at @xmath26 , which might be roughly comparable to the situation at stronger coupling , say @xmath72 , after treating the o(10 ) worst modes separately , as it is often done .",
    "the scaling quality remains to be tested ; we are currently measuring meson dispersions .",
    "another important question is the applicability of preconditioning techniques .",
    "they were already applied successfully to the hf without overlap @xcite ."
