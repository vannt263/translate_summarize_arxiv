    "before discussing various limits of the studied model , we point out formal equivalence between the excitonic condensation and superconductivity . this can be seen by exchanging the notion of particle and hole for one of the fermionic species , e.g. @xmath89 , which turns @xmath34-@xmath35 repulsion into attraction .",
    "this equivalence obviously breaks down when electromagnetic response is concerned since the excitons carry no charge . nevertheless , it is useful to consider the analogy to superconductivity , which is more familiar to most physicists .",
    "the excitonic order parameter in our study is local , i.e. has no @xmath22-dependence , which is analogous to @xmath90-wave superconductivity .",
    "an @xmath91 order parameter , composed of different orbitals , is unusual for a superconductor , due to the weakness of the electron - electron attraction , but can be easily realized in an excitonic condensate , as the electron - hole attraction is strong .",

    "the resulting effective hamiltonian with hopping treated to the second order is derived in appendix a. in the following , we discuss some of its aspects .",
    "first , we consider model ( [ eq : hubbard ] ) with the density - density interaction only for which the dmft calculations , reported in preceding section , were performed .",

    "the last term appears only for finite cross hopping and has the form @xmath105 .      the behavior of model ( [ eq : hubbard ] ) as revealed by the dmft calculations strongly depends on the band asymmetry @xmath3 .",

    "the solid order as well as the reentrant transition was found also in previous dmft simulations  @xcite of 2bhm with asymmetric bands .",
    "proximity to the beg limit thus provides a simple explanation of the od instability in the strong coupling and asymmetric bands region of model ( [ eq : hubbard ] ) .",
    "the analysis of the beg model  @xcite suggests that for @xmath124 competition between the anti - ferromagnetic and the solid phase gives rise to a rather complicated phase diagram .",
    "this parameter range is , however , beyond the scope of this work .      for general @xmath3",
    ", the hopping @xmath109 can not be neglected .",
    "much studied in the context of cold atoms , the spinless version of ( [ eq : boson1 ] ) is known to host a superfluid ( sf ) phase in addition to the solid ( s ) phase discussed above .",
    "existence of a supersolid order at the boundary between s and sf phases is a subject of intense research on the model generalizations  @xcite .",
    "the spinless model ( [ eq : boson1 ] ) can also be derived as the strong - coupling limit of the extended falicov - kimball model  @xcite .",
    "the sf phase is characterized by a finite value of @xmath125 , which corresponds to spontaneous appearance of an off - diagonal expectation value @xmath126 in 2bhm , and thus can be identified with the observed oo instability . without cross - hopping , @xmath53 , the sf phase of ( [ eq : boson1 ] ) is similar to the spinless case in the sense that it consists of two copies of the latter coupled only by amplitude fluctuations .",
    "inclusion of the cross - hopping has a very different effect on the spinless and spinful models . in the spinless case",
    "@xcite , the cross - hopping must have the same form as the @xmath127 operator and thus non - zero @xmath128 introduces a source term @xmath129 to the hamiltonian , removing the distinction between the normal and sf phases . in the spinful case ( [ eq : boson1 ] ) , however , the spin - preserving cross hopping has a different spin symmetry than the @xmath130 operators and therefore non - zero @xmath128 introduces the @xmath131 term instead .",

    "the corresponding operator @xmath208 describes the z - component of magnetization ( spin ) density with the distribution given by the product of @xmath34 and @xmath35 orbitals @xmath209 . in present case ,",
    "the product is a @xmath210 function , i.e. the leading multipole of the distribution is a dipole and the above operator may be viewed as describing an on - site magnetic quadrupole .",
    "the rotation of @xmath197 corresponds to changing the magnetization direction while keeping its distribution fixed , i.e. can not be viewed as a 3d rotation of the quadrupole as rigid object .",
    "the operator @xmath211 corresponding to imaginary @xmath207 describes an on - site pattern of a magnetization current .",
    "rotation of imaginary @xmath197 corresponds to changing the magnetization direction while keeping the current pattern fixed .",
    "complex @xmath212 is difficult to visualize . in this case",
    "it is possible to continuously rotate magnetic multipole into a local spin current without changing the energy of the system .",
    "a model built on @xmath213 and @xmath214 orbitals may be more realistic with respect to real materials .",
    "similar considerations would apply leading to a finite value of magnetic octupole , in case of real , and more a complicated pattern of the on - site spin current , in case of imaginary order parameter .",
    "while the direct experimental detection of the magnetic multipoles may be experimentally difficult , presumably , the most experimentally accessible would be the effect of excitonic order on the transport properties at weak to moderate coupling .      despite a narrow parameter range in the vicinity of the spin - state transition ,",
    "the present results reveal a rich phase diagram , nevertheless , other phases may exist nearby . in the @xmath38 limit and @xmath4 below the studied range , the beg phase diagram contains anti - ferromagnetic hs phase separated from the solid hs - ls phase by a narrow strip of a phase containing both magnetic and hs - ls order . for finite @xmath3",
    "the boundary between the s and sf provides an interesting possibility for a stable supersolid phase .",
    "although it was excluded for 2d spinless bosons  @xcite with a simple nn repulsion , the effect of the additional terms in ( [ eq : boson2 ] ) or the departure from the strong - coupling limit is unexplored .",
    "another interesting question is the possibility of coexistence of the sf and af magnetic orders , observed in the bosonic t - j model with anisotropic exchange  @xcite .",
    "our investigation of the hubbard model in the vicinity of spin - state transition was motivated by the physics of lacoo@xmath0 . while a two - band model ignoring the electron - lattice coupling is probably too simplistic to describe this complicated multi - orbital material ,",
    "some useful insights are obtained . in particular",
    ", the present study shows that the excitonic condensation is in a broad range of parameters preferred to the hs - ls order , an order which has been discussed in lacoo@xmath0 context and treated with first - principles lda+u method  @xcite .",
    "the proposal of excitonic condensation in this material may be tested on the same level of approximation by introducing the excitonic instead of the standard mean - field decoupling of the on - site interaction in lda+u .",
    "using dynamical mean - field theory we have performed an unbiased numerical search probing all possible particle - hole instabilities of the two - band hubbard model in the parameter range close to the spin - state transition .",
    "our main result is the observation of an instability towards condensation of spinful excitons . together with the previously reported solid hs - ls order , these are the only instabilities of the model in the studied parameter range .",
    "we have shown that keeping other parameters fixed the bandwidths ratio is the control parameter selecting the leading instability , an observation which has a particularly simple explanation in the strong coupling limit as tuning the ration of nn hopping and nn repulsion in a hard - core bosons model .",
    "the strong - coupling mapping onto spinful hard - core bosons with nn interaction provides a possibility of electronic realization of some exotic phases observed with cold atoms . comparing the solid hs - ls order and the superfluid excitonic order we find that the former does not exist in the weak coupling regime and due to its ising character",
    "can be easily suppressed by geometrical frustration , while the latter exists both in strong and weak coupling limits and due to the continuous character can better adapt to geometrical frustration , e.g. by forming a 120@xmath215 order on triangular lattice .",
    "the main implication for real materials is the fact that the excitonic condensation should be considered a competitor to the hs - ls order in systems close to the spin - state transition .",
    "we thank d. vollhardt , a. kampf , a. kauch , p. novk , r.  t. scalettar and j. otsuki for discussions and valuable suggestions .",

    "the parameters of the bosonic model were obtained by second order perturbation theory in the hopping using @xmath216 where @xmath217 and @xmath218 are the states built from the local ls and hs states and @xmath219 is everything else . the formula was evaluated in mathematica using the sneg package  @xcite .    @xmath220    where @xmath221 .",
    "in hamiltonian ( [ eq : hubbard ] ) we did distinguish between @xmath17 in @xmath18 and in @xmath19 .",
    "nevertheless , the above expressions apply to both the models with density - density interaction @xmath18 and the full interaction @xmath222 with the provision that in the density - density case @xmath223 and the other expressions are evaluated for @xmath224 .",
    "here we show how a mean - field decoupling of the @xmath225 term in the interaction gives rise to the spontaneous hybridization in the sf phase .",
    "first , we consider the @xmath178 case with degenerate @xmath176 and @xmath177 modes . writing the above term as @xmath226 we obtain decoupling @xmath227 using complex fields @xmath228 and @xmath229 , which acquire finite values @xmath230 in the sf phase .",
    "if the @xmath176 and @xmath177 are not degenerate the fields @xmath228 and @xmath229 are not independent . in this case",
    "we use a decoupling which based on the symmetric and anti - symmetric modes starting from rewriting the interaction as @xmath231 leading to a decoupling @xmath232 with @xmath233 comparing the corresponding terms in @xmath234 we see that finite @xmath235 implies @xmath236 and thus real @xmath237 and @xmath238 .",
    "finite @xmath239 on the other hand implies @xmath240 and thus imaginary @xmath237 and @xmath238 .",
    "since the decoupled term appears in both the @xmath134 and density - density interactions the above derivations applies to both cases . in the @xmath134 interaction , which includes the spin - flip term , decoupling in terms of @xmath241 is possible , which leads to the same mean - field equations and gives rise to the @xmath242 component of the order parameter ."
