    "in the theory of elementary particles , higgs boson is introduced to elucidate the origin of particle masses .",
    "the standard model ( sm ) proposed the single higgs doublet that gives rise to a scalar particle , while extended supersymmetric models hypothesized that two higgs doublets give separate vacuum expectation values to the up - type and down - type quarks . among the extended models beyond sm , the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) sets the upper bound of the lightest neutral higgs mass around 130 gev/@xmath3@xcite .",
    "since the mass of sm higgs boson is expected to be between 114.4 gev/@xmath3 and 211 gev/@xmath3 by lep experiment@xcite , the higgs boson should be identified if it is found .",
    "therefore a precise measurement of higgs couplings to fermions at a future @xmath1 linear collider is indispensable to unveil physics of the higgs sector . in particular",
    ", a measurement of the branching ratio of @xmath0 would provide a unique opportunity to study higgs to up - type quark coupling .",
    "however , the @xmath5 is the dominant process for higgs mass below 140 gev/@xmath3 .",
    "a high efficient charm quark identification is necessary for the precise branching ratio study and it is possible only with a high performance vertex detector .",
    "development of this vertex detector has been a major issue for the linear collider @xcite . to this end",
    ", understanding detector performance is extremely important to physics .    in this paper , we introduce our method of measuring the branching ratio of @xmath0 against sm @xmath1 processes and other decay branches from higgs . in addition , we would like to see the significance of this precision study with four layers of charge coupled device ( ccd ) and an additional inner layer of vertex detector .",
    "a mass of sm higgs boson is assumed to be 120 gev/@xmath6 and the center - of - mass energy of 250 gev is selected by the highest @xmath7-channel production cross - section at this energy , 226 fb .",
    "it is concerned with an integrated luminosity of 500 @xmath8 for the first few years running of the future @xmath1 linear collider experiment .",
    "events were generated using pythia 5.7 @xcite and only the higgsstrahlung process ( @xmath9 ) was taken into account .",
    "the branching ratios of the sm higgs boson was estimated by the hdecay program @xcite .",
    "depending on the decay modes of @xmath10 , the events are categorized into 4-jet mode ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) , 2-jet mode ( @xmath13 and @xmath12 ) , and charged lepton pair mode ( @xmath14 and @xmath12 ) . since the branching ratio of higgs to @xmath15 is estimated to be very small ( @xmath163% ) , we concentrated on the 2-jet and 4-jet modes only .",
    "as background processes from @xmath1 collision , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 events were considered with corresponding cross - sections of 15460 fb , 1250 fb , and 47300 fb , respectively .",
    "the detector simulation was performed using a fast parameterized simulator @xcite , which is implemented in the joint linear collider ( currently called as global linear collider ) detector @xcite . in this simulator five parameters of the helical track and their error matrices including non - diagonal elements were generated ; thus the quality of the vertices is similar to that of a full simulation .",
    "the jlc vertex detector is equipped with four layers of ccd at the radius from 2.4 cm to 6 cm of which intrinsic spatial resolutions are 4 @xmath19 in @xmath20 and z directions .",
    "the solenoidal magnet field of the detector is 3 tesla . with a vertex detector constraint ,",
    "the impact parameter resolution in xy plane ( @xmath21 ) is @xmath22 , and the momentum resolution for charged track ( @xmath23 ) is @xmath24 .",
    "this study was done with four / five ccd layers of vertex detector parameter , repectively , to see the influence of the vertex detector options on the physics result .",
    "the vertex detector parameter sets are shown in the table  [ tab : table1 ] .",
    ".[tab : table1 ] two vertex detector parameter set .",
    "the number of ccd layers and their positions(in cm ) from the center of the beam pipe , the radius of beam pipe are listed for each set . [ cols=\"<,^,>,^,>,^,>,^,>,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the results of @xmath15 event selection are summarized in table  [ tab : table2 ] .",
    "as seen in the table , roughly 120 and 310 @xmath0 events are selected in 2-jet and 4-jet modes , respectively , with a reasonable significance despite its small branching ratio of @xmath0 and large backgrounds from non - higgs processes and non-@xmath25 higgs decays .    in the @xmath0 measurement in 2-jet mode ,",
    "major backgrounds are those from @xmath5 where @xmath26 is misidentified as @xmath2 and @xmath27 events which are reconstructed as 2-jet events due to imperfect detector acceptance .",
    "@xmath28 is not considered here due to relatively small cross - section than other background processes .    in the case of 4-jet mode , @xmath27 and @xmath29 events",
    "are increased after event selection because two @xmath2 jets can be produced in the final state of these processes .",
    "in addition to the c - jet contamination from backgrounds , there is additional ambiguity in selecting two higgs jets out of four jets . combining these effects",
    ", the significance in the 4-jet mode is less than 3@xmath30 and worse than the 2-jet mode .",
    "the statistical uncertainty combining 2-jet and 4-jet analyses is estimated as 25.7% in the case of four ccd layers of the vertex detector . similar analysis with different detector configuration",
    "was report@xcite for assumption of the same higgs mass and luminosity at @xmath31=350 gev and 500 gev that the relative braching ratio errors be 19% and 39% , respectively .",
    "when an additional ccd layer of the vertex detector is included near the interaction point , the impact parameter resolution for low momentum track is improved since the lever arm for track extrapolation to the interaction point is reduced .",
    "thus we can reconstruct secondary vertices much closer to the interaction point .",
    "the better separation of @xmath26- and @xmath2- jets reduces backgrounds in the event selection , especially in 2-jet mode .",
    "improvements in 4-jet selection is not decisive , suffering ambiguities in higgs jet selections . combining 2-jet and 4-jet , relatively 20% improvement in background reduction",
    "is achieved compared to the study with four ccd layers of the vertex detector .",
    "in this study we focused on the @xmath0 measurements in 2-jet and 4-jet modes in the case of 120 gev/@xmath3 higgs mass at the center - of - mass energy of 250 gev in the future @xmath1 linear collider . in the study ,",
    "the topological vertex finding algorithm was used for tagging the @xmath2-jet and the neural network was used to optimize the @xmath0 selection .    with consideration of 500 @xmath4 data , we obtained the statistical uncertainty of 25.7% for the measurement of @xmath0 with four ccd layers vertex detector .",
    "the statistical uncertainty would be improved to 20.1% with an additional ccd layer of vertex detector near the interaction point .",
    "we would like to thank the members of acfa joint linear collider physics and detector working group @xcite for valuable discussions during the course of the analysis .",
    "we also thank dr .",
