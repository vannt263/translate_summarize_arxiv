    "we were not able to prove the existence of the co - motion functions ( optimal maps ) in the general case , although we have hints that , for reasonable densities , it migth be possible .",
    "as mentioned , this is always a delicate problem .",
    "we could only prove the existence of an optimal map in the special case @xmath58 ( appendix [ app_fn2 ] ) .    in the following sections we introduce the optimal transport problem and we give the details of the results anticipated here .",

    "indeed , eq .   is a weak form of eq .   which does not require @xmath64 to be differentiable .",
    "however , as said , proving the existence of the optimal maps is in general a delicate problem . moreover , the problem posed by eq .",
    "has actually the more general kantorovich form .",
    "this can be seen by doing the following ( with @xmath89 ) :    * identify the probability @xmath90 with @xmath91 ; * set all the marginals @xmath92 equal to the density divided by the number of particles @xmath0 , @xmath93 ; * set the cost function equal to the electron - electron coulomb repulsion , @xmath94    thus , solving the problem of finding the minimum possible electron - electron repulsion energy in a given density is equivalent to find the optimal way of transporting @xmath2 times the density @xmath3 into itself , with cost function given by the coulomb repulsion , in the relaxed kantorovich formulation .",
    "what are the advantages of this reformulation ? as anticipated in sec .",
    "[ sec_resdft ] , we can put many of the conjectures on @xmath16 $ ] @xcite on firm grounds , and we can rewrite eq .   in a convenient dual form that allows to use linear programming techniques , with the potential of giving access to a toolbox of algorithms already developed in a different , well - established , context .",
    "from the point of view of mass transportation theory , the problem of eq .   poses two challenges : _ i _ ) the cost function corresponding to the coulomb potential , eq .",
    ", is different from the usual cost considered in the field . in particular",
    ", it is not bounded at the origin and it decreases with distance , thus requiring a generalized formal framework ; _ ii _ ) the literature on the problem with several marginals is not very extensive ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "nonetheless , we could prove several results . in",
    "what follows , we state them , relegating many technical details of the proofs in the appendix .",
    "[ exis ] if the cost function @xmath95 is nonnegative and lower semicontinuous there exists an optimal probability @xmath96 for the minimum problem .",
    "the proof is an application of the prokhorov compactness theorem for measures .",
    "in fact , taken a minimizing sequence @xmath97 for problem , since they are all probabilities , the sequence @xmath97 is compact in the weak * convergence of measures , so ( a subsequence of ) it converges weakly * to a nonnegative measure @xmath75 , and this is enough to obtain @xmath98 then @xmath75 is a good candidate for being an optimal probability for problem . to achieve the proof it remains to show that @xmath75 is a probability and that the marginal condition @xmath99 is fulfilled .",
    "this is true if the convergence of @xmath97 to @xmath75 is `` narrow '' , which by prokhorov theorem amounts to show the so - called tightness condition : @xmath100 the tightness condition above follows easily by the fact that all @xmath101 satisfy the marginal conditions @xmath102 ( @xmath103 .

    "in fact , it is enough to notice that , taken a probability @xmath75 , the new probability @xmath107 where @xmath106 runs over all permutations of @xmath108 , has a cost less than or equal to the one of @xmath75 and the same marginals .",
    "we now turn to the important dual reformulation .",
    "the standard dual problem in optimal transport theory is :    [ dual ] let @xmath95 be a lower semicontinuous and finite valued function , then @xmath109 moreover , the dual maximization problem also admits a solution .",

    "kantorovich potential_.    however , the theorem above does not apply directly to the optimal transport problem of interest here , because the cost , given by eq .  , takes the value @xmath117 on the set @xmath118 .",

    "in particular , with our reformulation we were able to prove immediately several results on the strong - interaction limit of dft .",

    "the formal and practical aspects of our new reformulation are enticing for dft : making routinely available the piece of exact information contained in the strong - interaction limit can largely broaden its applicability , both by developing a `` sce dft '' @xcite ( which uses a strong interacting system as a reference ) , and via new exchange - correlation functionals for standard ks dft @xcite .",
