    "black holes are among the most fascinating predictions in the theory of general relativity . during the past 20 years",
    "there have been intense research efforts on black holes and their effect on the astrophysical environment . with the exciting possibility of detecting gravitational wave signals from black holes by the gravitational wave observatories under construction(ligo and virgo  @xcite )",
    ", we have seen an increasing surge of interest .",
    "the black hole events likely to be observed by the gravitational wave observatories involve highly dynamical black holes , e.g. , two black holes in collision .",
    "the most powerful tool in studying such highly dynamical and intrinsically non - linear events is probably numerical treatment . in recent years",
    ", there has been significant progress in numerical relativity in this direction ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "in particular , long evolutions of highly dynamical black hole spacetimes are now possible  @xcite , opening up the opportunity of many interesting studies .",
    "the defining character of a black hole is its event horizon ( eh ) .",
    "the eh is defined as the boundary of the causal past of the future null infinity ( for a rigorous description , see , e.g. ref .",
    "photons emitted inside this boundary surface can not escape to infinity while those emitted outside in a suitable direction can .",
    "it is the existence of such a boundary surface that makes a black hole `` black '' .",
    "only when a horizon surface is located can we know for sure that the spacetime that we are studying contains a black hole .",
    "locating such horizon surfaces is the subject of this first paper in our series studying event horizons in numerical relativity .",
    "the study of the dynamics of this surface is crucial for understanding the dynamics of a black hole spacetime . in the membrane paradigm of black holes",
    "@xcite , black holes are characterized by the properties of its eh , which is regarded as a 2d membrane living in a 3d space , evolving in time and endowed with many everyday physical properties like viscosity , conductivity , entropy , etc .",
    "we believe this point of view is powerful in providing insight into the numerical studies of black holes . in the second paper in this series  @xcite , we present methods and tools for studying these properties of the horizon surface . in the third paper in the series  @xcite",
    ", we turn to the physics of black holes that can be explored using these tools .",
    "there are two properties of the eh that make its location difficult to determine in numerical relativity : it is defined non - locally both in space and in time , and moreover , in an acausal manner .",
    "therefore its location , and even its existence at any time can not be determined without knowledge of the complete four geometry of the spacetime . in this paper",
    "we will present methods that overcome these difficulties of finding eh s in black hole spacetimes .    consider a numerically constructed spacetime represented by a set of data given on a 3 + 1 lattice .",
    "suppose the numerical evolution has covered a region of spacetime so that at the end of the evolution , one can locate a spatial domain which is likely to contain the eh .",
    "( we show below how this can be done . ) on the one hand , as numerical evolution often does not cover null infinity  @xcite , generally one can not give a precise location of the eh even on the final time slice .",
    "on the other hand , the black hole events we are interested in often involve black holes eventually settling down to a stationary state after going through violent processes , e.g. , the coalescence of two black holes . if the numerical evolution covers late enough times , so that at the end of the evolution the geometry returns approximately to stationarity , it is often easy to have an _ approximate _ location of the eh , as we shall show below .",
    "we note that at late times , if the spacetime has truly returned to stationarity , the difficulties of finding the eh due to its acausal nature and non - locality in time disappear , as the geometry is the same on each time slice henceforth .",
    "of course , true stationarity is probably impossible in numerical evolution .",
    "one can aim at most at approximate stationarity .",
    "we note that such approximate stationarity is possible , as dynamical black hole spacetimes can now be evolved for a long time ( commonly @xmath0 , and in some cases to @xmath1 ) @xcite .",
    "therefore the first set of questions in the numerical study of black hole eh s is this . consider a numerically constructed spacetime , such that one has an approximately stationary final configuration .",
    "assume that although the eh can not be located exactly , it is known to exist in a certain spatial domain .",
    "can one determine this horizon - containing domain in all the previous time slices during which the spacetime is highly dynamical , which is often the real epoch of interest ?",
    "that is , how does this horizon - containing domain evolve in a dynamical spacetime ?",
    "we will show that in the language used here , even if the horizon - containing domain is fairly large at the final time , it can be narrowed down tremendously at earlier times .",
    "if the eh can be approximately located at late times , after the black hole and surrounding spacetime return to approximate stationarity , our result implies that the eh can be accurately determined throughout the dynamical period of interest .",
    "the present paper focuses on this set of problems of locating the eh in a black hole spacetime .",
    "we have developed two generations of `` event horizon finders '' , based on two basic ideas  @xcite : ( 1 ) integrate backward in time , and ( 2 ) integrate the horizon surface instead of the individual geodesics .",
    "we discuss these ideas in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : ideas ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] we examine how much accuracy one can obtain in locating the eh throughout its history ( i.e. , how small the horizon - containing domain can become ) in various sample numerically constructed spacetimes , including distorted schwarzschild and kerr black holes , and colliding black holes .",
    "we also compare various methods for locating the eh , including our two generations of eh finders based on backward integration and another method recently proposed using forward integration  @xcite .",
    "a basic assumption in this paper is that one can locate a certain horizon - containing domain at the end of the numerical evolution .",
    "an interesting question is to what extent one can use the techniques developed in this paper to improve the confidence that the domain truly contains an eh , or to rule out such a possibility .",
    "although we shall not deal with this question in this paper , it is easy to see that the techniques developed can also be useful in this regard . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] we shall see that one can easily narrow this domain on the final configuration to a large extent by examining trajectories of null surfaces .",
    "suppose for the moment the actual event horizon ( eh ) is given on the final time slice of the numerical evolution ( for simplicity of discussion , the evolution is assumed to be in the 3 + 1 slicing of spacetime ; other schemes , such as 2 + 2 , could be treated as well ) .",
    "how does one determine its location at earlier times ?",
    "one may consider integrating null geodesics forward in time , selecting those that successfully arrive at the given eh at the final time .",
    "there are two conditions that must be satisfied for success : ( i ) the geodesic must land on the given eh , and ( ii ) the tangent of the geodesics must be the outgoing normal to the eh . in principle , such stringent requirements could be satisfied and the history of the eh could be traced out with such an algorithm .",
    "however , there is an intrinsic difficulty making such an algorithm very inefficient . by the definition of the eh",
    ", outgoing null geodesics slightly inside the eh will fall into the singularity after some short time , while outgoing null geodesics just slightly outside will escape to null infinity .",
    "therefore , evolving null geodesics forward in time near the eh is a physically unstable process .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : edfink ] the behavior of various outgoing null geodesics in a spherical black hole spacetime is shown in terms of eddington - finkelstein coordinates  @xcite .",
    "the horizon is given as a solid line while photons are given as dotted lines .",
    "outgoing null geodesics starting out infinitesimally close to the horizon spread out to cover a large region of the spacetime .",
    "they are `` everywhere '' on a late time slice .",
    "this physical instability , coupled with the inevitable finite differencing error in a numerical calculation , ensures that null geodesics will move away from the true position of the eh , even if they are right on it initially .",
    "an accurate determination of the history of the eh will not be possible unless ( a ) the spacetime data has a very high resolution , and ( b ) a very large number of photons are followed , so that they are `` dense '' enough to have some of them stay near the eh throughout the evolution .    however , a moment s reflection tells us that this important property of the eh can be used to our advantage ; the instability of integrating outgoing null geodesics forward in time near the eh implies that when integrating these geodesics backward in time near the eh , they will converge onto the horizon .",
    "the backward direction is the stable direction of integration .",
    "this is one of the two basic ingredients in building our eh finders . in our first generator",
    "eh finder  @xcite , called the `` backward photon '' method , we trace the eh by integrating null geodesics backward in time . the geodesic equation is a second order differential equation ,    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is an affine parameter along the geodesic .",
    "we note that this backward integration method requires that one first complete the spacetime evolution and store the entire spacetime evolution metric , or at least a strip of it which safely contains the full history of the eh .",
    "however , in all cases we studied , being able to integrate in the stable direction is well worth the extra storage requirement . as the null geodesics are `` attracted '' to the eh when integrated backward , we found that the position of the eh can be determined to an accuracy of a small fraction of a grid zone , as shown in the next section .",
    "forward integration schemes generally also require storing the entire spacetime evolution , as many photons must be `` shot '' forward and then tested to see if they end up inside or outside the horizon at the final time  @xcite .",
    "two comments regarding the `` attraction '' of the eh in backward integration are in order .",
    "firstly , this `` attraction '' is only in the global sense .",
    "locally , the eh has no special property . that is , geometrically the eh is not distinct from other surfaces . as the geodesic deviation equation is governed by the riemann curvature tensor , which has no special value at the horizon ,",
    "the outgoing null geodesics are not attracted to the eh in any local sense . on the other hand , in a 3 + 1 numerical evolution",
    ", only those outgoing null geodesics that are either very near or inside the eh at early times can remain in the finite range of the spacetime with a non vanishing lapse which is covered by the numerical evolution at late enough times .",
    "in other words , when integrating backward in time , outgoing photons in this range approach the eh after a sufficiently long integration .",
    "the eh is attractive only in this global sense in time . note that this attractive property implies that our starting point in the backward integration need _ not _ be exactly on the eh .",
    "this is a key point that we will quantify below .",
    "secondly , this attractive property of the horizon is just for outgoing photons .",
    "an ingoing photon when traced backward will not only leave the eh surface , it may even leave the finite region of the spacetime . in the one dimensional case ,",
    "inward and outward photons are clearly distinct ( only outgoing ones are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : edfink ] ) , but for the general 3d case , when the two tangential directions of the eh are also considered , the situation becomes more complicated .",
    "( here normal and tangential are meant in the 3d spatial , not spacetime , sense . ) whether a trajectory can eventually be `` attracted '' to the eh or not , and how long it takes for it to become `` attracted '' , depends on the photon s starting direction of motion .",
    "we note that even for a photon which is already exactly on the eh at a certain instant , if its velocity at that point has some component tangential to the eh surface ( as generated by , say , numerical inaccuracy in integration ) , the photon will move outside of the eh when traced backward in time . for a small tangential velocity",
    ", the photon will eventually return to the eh .",
    "the duration and distance it moves outside the eh depends on its tangential velocity .",
    "also , the position to which it returns will not be the original position .",
    "this kind of tangential drifting is undesirable not just because it introduces inaccuracy in the location of the eh , but more importantly , because it can lead to spurious dynamics of the `` eh '' thus found .",
    "neighboring generators may cross , leading to numerically artificial caustic points ( for an introductory discussion of caustics , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite , chapter 10 . )",
    "unfortunately such tangential drifting is not easy to avoid due to the nature of the geodesic equation ( 1 ) which we integrate backward .",
    "the geodesic equation is not only second order , but also requires derivatives of the numerically generated metric data which are generally more inaccurate .",
    "another consequence of the second order nature of the geodesic equation is that not just the positions but also the directions must be specified in starting the backward integration .",
    "neighboring photons must have their starting direction well correlated in order to avoid tangential drifting across one another .",
    "we find it important to make explicit use of the property that the surface we wish to trace is a closed 2d surface embedded in the 3d space at the start of the backward integration .",
    "while the starting positions of the photons are taken to be on this surface , the starting directions are taken to be normals to this surface .",
    "of course even if the geodesics have accurate starting values they may still drift due to inaccuracy in integration , as discussed above .",
    "we find that the `` backward photon '' method is still quite demanding in finding an accurate history of the eh , although the difficulties are much milder than those arising from the instability of integrating forward in time .    in our second generation horizon finder",
    ", building on the above idea of explicitly using the surface forming property of the eh , we follow the entire horizon surface itself , rather than tracking individual photons independently .",
    "generally speaking , the eh can be considered as a 2 + 1 null surface , except at special points where its normal can not be defined . except for these special points , which we shall discuss later , one can represent the 2 + 1 eh surface by a function @xmath4 which satisfies the null condition @xmath5 hence the evolution of the surface can be obtained by a simple integration , @xmath6    in our second generation horizon finder , we integrate this equation backwards in time .",
    "this is what we call our `` backward surface '' method .",
    "notice that at the final time , the eh is given as a closed 2d surface .",
    "given this as the starting condition for the backward integration of eq .",
    "( [ evolve ] ) , there is no other condition needed ( e.g. , there is no need to specify either an initial direction or boundary conditions for the surface ) .",
    "the reconstruction of the complete function @xmath7 gives us the full history of the eh ( in fact , much more than this , as we will discuss below and detail in ref .  @xcite ) .",
    "both the backward photon and backward surface method work very well as shown in sec .  [ sec : numerics ] below . however , there are a number of advantages of using the backward surface method :    _ ( i ) _ of primary importance is that the method is simpler and less susceptible to numerical error than the backward photon method .",
    "notice that eq .",
    "( [ evolve ] ) contains only derivatives of the surface and _ not _ of the metric components themselves and is therefore less susceptible to the numerical inaccuracies present in the metric data .",
    "the horizon is generally found in numerically evolved spacetimes in regions where metric functions contain rather steep gradients that are poorly resolved  @xcite , and hence their derivatives may not be accurately known there .",
    "( _ ii _ ) tangential drifting is not a source of error , because the only direction that a surface can move is normal to itself .",
    "once the surface becomes the eh , it can not drift away from it .",
    "this is in contrast to integrating geodesics ; even if the geodesic is right on the horizon at some instant in time , it does not guarantee that it can stay on it all the time .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : tandrift ] below .",
    "( _ iii _ ) unlike integrating null geodesics , the result of this method is guaranteed to be surface forming , as we are explicitly integrating surfaces .",
    "this is a nontrivial advantage over integrating geodesics ; in particular , the integrated geodesics can fail to be surface forming , either due to the numerical error discussed above , or due to the existence of caustics on the horizon .",
    "at the caustics the geodesics leave the eh surface when integrated backward in time . if there are geodesics leaving the eh through caustics , but this caustic point is not so recognized , and the eh is taken to be the surface connecting all geodesics , the evolution history of it would be completely wrong",
    ". however , it is nontrivial to determine whether a caustic or numerical error causes geodesics to become non - surface forming . in both cases",
    ", we may see null geodesics cross one another and move outward .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : tandrift ] below .",
    "( _ iv _ ) the surface method is naturally suitable for handling and studying caustic structures on the eh .",
    "( here for simplicity of discussion we indiscriminately refer to all classes of points at which horizon generators leave the eh when traced backward in time as horizon caustics , see , e.g. , ref .  @xcite . ) as the normals of the eh are different when the caustic point is approached in different directions , strictly speaking the eh is not a null surface at such points , and eq .",
    "( [ evolve ] ) would seem to be in difficulty .",
    "however , we note that in the generic case of an isolated caustic point , the eh surface surrounding the caustic point can be evolved using one - sided spatial derivatives on the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ evolve ] ) . despite the fact that there is no well defined normal to the surface at a caustic ,",
    "the motions of surface elements on different sides of the caustic must be continuous as determined by eq .",
    "( [ evolve ] ) with appropriate one sided derivatives , as the eh is a continuous closed surface at each time slice . in the two black hole collision case studied below in sec .",
    "[ sec : twobh ] , fig .",
    "[ fig : twobhphot ] , there is clearly a cusp in the eh along the @xmath8-axis , so that the surface is not smooth there , but it is continuous .",
    "this is obtained with a one - sided treatment of the derivative there .",
    "this treatment requires the knowledge of where caustics would be forming _",
    "a priori_. such _ a priori _ knowledge is often possible for spacetimes with symmetry properties .",
    "in fact , all dynamic black hole spacetimes evolved to date ( of which we are aware ) have such properties . at those points where caustics may appear ,",
    "suitable one - side derivatives are used .",
    "alternatively , one can treat horizon caustics with the surface method _ without _ introducing special treatment for possible caustic points , provided that we do not restrict eq .",
    "( [ evolve ] ) to describe _ only _ the eh , but _ also _ the locus of the null generators which leave the eh through the caustic points backward in time .",
    "that is , in tracing eq .",
    "( [ evolve ] ) backward , we allow the closed surface to cross itself .",
    "the point of crossing is the caustic .",
    "although the normal of the surface is not continuous going across the caustic on the eh , it is continuous going from the eh across the caustic point to the locus of generators which has left the eh  @xcite .",
    "this is true provided a suitable identification of neighboring surface elements is used , namely , when the identification of two neighboring surface elements does not change in time .",
    "this issue is considered in this paper where we treat the collision of two black holes in section [ sec : twobh ] , when caustics are important .",
    "these backward surface and photon methods bring for the first time the possibility of studying the properties of horizon generators and caustics in numerical relativity , but the surface method provides a particularly elegant , economical , and accurate way of computing this structure .    before we go on to the next subsections on the tests and the accuracy of the methods , we comment on the fact that the starting position of the eh in the backward integration is often not known precisely .",
    "as pointed out earlier , as long as the numerical evolution can be carried to a point that the black hole returns to approximate stationarity , it is often possible to locate a region which contains the eh . for example , the apparent horizon ( ah ) is always inside the event horizon ( provided quantum effects are ignored ) .",
    "if an ah is found , it can be taken to be the inner boundary of this horizon - containing region . the real task in locating",
    "the horizon is to determine the evolution of this horizon - containing region . due to the attractive nature of the null surfaces to the",
    "eh , the horizon - containing region can be narrowed substantially in the backward integration .",
    "indeed we shall see that , using our methods , it is often easy to narrow this region down to much less than a grid separation used in the numerical construction of the spacetime . in some sense",
    "the location of the eh is determined to a precision higher than the resolution of the background spacetime , something seemingly impossible at first sight .",
    "this is not paradoxical as in all cases studied in this paper , the eh surface expressed as a function , eq .",
    "( [ ff ] ) , is constructed using information and interpolations involving many data points , hence `` washing out '' some local fluctuations . however , if the horizon - containing region were to just span a few angular grid points , the localization of it to a small fraction of a grid separation would no longer be meaningful .    using our backward methods we are able to trace accurately the entire history of the eh , as we detail in the next section . however , there are cases in which in the region where the numerically constructed spacetimes are badly resolved ( e.g. , the crotch region in the two black hole case study below ) , where the backward surface method method is capable of producing more reliable results .",
    "the basic difference in the two methods is in their computational requirements and convenience .",
    "a typical case studied here is that of a black hole interacting with a gravitational wave .",
    "such a case is resolved on a grid of 200 radial by 53 angular zones , and evolved to @xmath9 . to trace the eh to 1/10 of a grid separation for the dynamical period of the evolution ( @xmath10 ) takes only a few minutes on a computer workstation . for the backward photon method to achieve the same accuracy",
    ", it takes several times longer . for future applications with dynamical black hole spacetimes",
    "evolved to thousands of @xmath11 , we believe the backward surface method is most promising .",
    "in this section we discuss both the numerical implementations of our surface methods and provide examples of their applications to dynamical spherical black holes , distorted axisymmetric black holes with and without rotation , and colliding black holes .",
    "first we discuss details of the numerical implementation of these methods . for the backward photon method",
    ", we use a standard adaptive step size , fourth order in time runge - kutta method  @xcite to integrate the second order geodesic equation  ( [ geodesic ] ) . for the surface method",
    "we have used a number of methods , including second order leapfrog , a second order maccormack predictor corrector method , and a fourth order runge - kutta method using the method of lines to integrate hyperbolic eq .",
    "( [ evolve ] ) in time as a set of coupled ordinary differential equations .",
    "all methods give similar results , but for highest accuracy , we use the fourth order runge - kutta method of lines to generate the data presented here .    in following the horizon",
    "backward through the spacetime , we necessarily require the spacetime data at points that do not lie on the numerical grid .",
    "for this we must interpolate the spacetime data to the actual location of the horizon at each time . for the backward photon method , we must interpolate _ both _ the metric and its derivatives to these locations . on the other hand , for the surface method",
    "we need _ only _ the metric itself . for both methods",
    ", we find that second order interpolation is adequate to determine these data values .    in the surface method ,",
    "the location of the surface is represented by a function .",
    "the use of a suitable parameterization of the surface is important . for the axisymmetric cases discussed in this paper , a convenient choice is @xmath12 with this parameterization , eq .",
    "( [ evolve ] ) for the evolution of the surface becomes @xmath13 the angular derivatives of the function @xmath14 are computed using both second and fourth order finite difference methods , with similar results .",
    "although this way of representing the surface works well for almost all cases discussed in this paper , as we show in section  [ sec : twobh ] , other parameterizations can be necessary at times .        in this section",
    "we show how the methods detailed above can be applied to various different single black hole spacetimes .",
    "the first case we consider is a pure , spherical schwarzschild black hole , evolved with the 2d , axisymmetric black hole code described in refs .",
    "we use this important testbed case to show the accuracy to which one can determine the location of the horizon in a numerically evolved spacetime .",
    "although the spacetime is geometrically the static schwarzschild spacetime , it is evolved numerically with a maximal slicing condition which makes the metric functions change in time . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , such time dependence makes even schwarzschild quite difficult to evolve numerically for long periods of time ( beyond about @xmath15 with reasonable grid parameters ) . as the coordinates fall in towards the hole the horizon moves out in coordinate space , the lapse collapses , and large gradients develop in the metric function near the horizon .",
    "( for more details on these problems , see refs .",
    "@xcite . ) the advantage of using this as our first testbed case is that , on the one hand , the numerical spacetime constructed with this code has many of the properties and difficulties of a general numerically constructed black hole spacetime . on the other hand ,",
    "the spacetime is really a schwarzschild spacetime for which we know where the eh should be for all time . in particular , in this case the apparent horizon ( ah ) and eh coincide .",
    "we have accurate ah finders  @xcite that can locate the ah , and thus in this case the eh ; on any given single slice of the spacetime we know both horizons without needing to know the future or past of that slice .",
    "this provides us with important accuracy checks on our methods of locating the eh throughout the evolution .    in figs .",
    "[ fig : ehahsph]a - d we show results for a spherical black hole spacetime evolved with our axisymmetric 2d black hole code .",
    "we apply our horizon finder to the data obtained in the evolution assuming neither spherical symmetry , nor the fact that the spacetime geometry is really schwarzschild . at the final time slice , the horizon - containing region",
    "is determined by examining the lapse function and the radial metric function .",
    "for a spacetime evolved with maximal slicing , the event horizon resides in a region with a partially collapsed lapse function . in fig .",

    "the separation exponentially decreases down to @xmath26 grid zones at @xmath27 .",
    "this rapid shrinking of the horizon - containing region is a direct consequence of the divergence of null geodesics forward in time shown in fig .",

    "by @xmath34 , all the surfaces are within @xmath24th of a grid zone .",

    "as these spikes become ever steeper during the evolution , they become less and less well resolved , and therefore they are not accurately modeled on the numerical grid .",
    "this lack of accuracy in the spacetime itself is reflected in the calculation of the area of the apparent horizon at late times , which increases rather than remaining constant .",
    "remarkably , this lack of accuracy at late times , when the eh finding algorithm is started , does _ not _ cause any difficulty in finding the eh at earlier times , as seen in the figures . therefore , not only are our algorithms able to find accurately the true eh even with a poor initial guess for its location , they are also insensitive to inaccuracies in the spacetime data that inevitably occur at late times .    finally , in fig .  [",
    "fig : tandrift ] , we show the tangential drifting that can occur with the backward photon method , as discussed in sec .  [",
    "sec : ideas ] .",
    "[ fig : tandrift ] also serves as an illustration to the other comment we made above concerning the `` attractiveness '' of the eh to backward integrated photons , namely , the attraction is only in the global sense . in this example",
    "the tangential drifting is due to the choice of the initial direction of integration .",
    "two photons are traced backward ( shown as dotted lines ) beginning at the exact location of the eh at @xmath15 , but with a 3% error in the starting direction .",
    "that is , instead of being normal to the eh ( @xmath41 , in obvious notations ) , we use @xmath42 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : tandrift ] , the trajectories of these photons are shown with the corresponding times marked . the radial coordinate are normalized by the position of the eh , so that the eh is at @xmath43 on the vertical ( radial coordinate @xmath44 ) axis .",
    "we see that with the 3% error in the starting directions of the photons , the photons move out of the eh when traced backward in time . if these photons were taken as horizon generators , this would introduce a small error ( note the scale of the @xmath44 axis ) in the location of the `` eh '' for a period of time , as the photons are gradually `` attracted '' back to the correct radial location after some integration . however , the error in the tangential direction is substantial , as we can see in fig .  [",
    "fig : tandrift ] , where the horizontal axis is given in terms of @xmath45 in radians .",
    "in particular , the two photons cross each other , creating an artificial `` caustic '' at @xmath46 on their way out from the eh .",
    "although they return to the correct radial eh location eventually , their @xmath45 values change dramatically , making the trajectories very different from those of the true horizon generators .",
    "the case just discussed was a vacuum schwarzschild black hole with no true physical dynamics , although the motion of the coordinates through the spacetime makes both the black hole evolution and tracking of the eh nontrivial . in order to break the degeneracy between the ah and eh , we next consider a non - vacuum case . in this case",
    "we evolve a spherical black hole with a relativistic , massless klein - gordon scalar field falling into it .",
    "the system is described by the klein - gordon equation , @xmath47 coupled to the einstein equation through the energy momentum tensor of the scalar field .",
    "this problem has been studied previously in ref .",
    "@xcite .    with a gravitating scalar field falling into the black hole ,",
    "the system has true physical dynamics .",
    "not only does the horizon move out as coordinates fall into the hole , as above , but now the horizon also expands in a geometric sense , as its area must increase to accommodate the infalling matter .",
    "a particular test case is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scalar ] . here",
    "the scalar field was set up in a gaussian shell surrounding the black hole .",
    "as the field propagates into the hole , the horizon expands as expected .",
    "the solid line labeled `` event horizon '' is obtained by integrating the surface backward in time from the ah location at time @xmath48 .",
    "we refer to this line as the `` eh '' because as shown above it will converge rapidly to the true eh .",
    "the dashed line is the ah obtained by solving the ah equation  @xcite at each time slice .",
    "note that the ah always lies inside the eh , as expected , and that at early times the eh is quite a bit larger as it starts expanding before the incoming matter arrives .",
    "the two solid lines labeled `` escaping photon '' and `` trapped photon '' were obtained by integrating radially outgoing null geodesics _",
    "forward _ in time from locations 1/10th of a grid zone inside and 4 grid zones outside the eh at early times .",
    "we note that even in this spherically symmetric case it is not possible to integrate accurately the path of the event horizon _ forward _ in time .",
    "even when photons were placed right on the known horizon position initially , due to the unstable nature of the forward integration , the horizon could be tracked for only a short while before it would diverge away from the true eh .",
    "if we want to track the horizon further in time , one way is to `` abandon '' the original photons , and start new ones closer in to the horizon at the time when the original ones get too far apart , but the resulting horizon will consist of a discontinuous surface . a variation on this idea would be to use forward photons simply as a probe . if any photon integrated forward in time from a given point is not within the apparent horizon at late times , then that point may be considered outside the eh . by integrating many photons forward from many spacetime points , a horizon surface can be mapped out , as shown in ref .",
    "this is an effective but time consuming procedure , and the trajectories traced do not give the trajectories of the the generators of the horizon .",
    "next we present results for an axisymmetric black hole that has been distorted by the presence of a gravitational wave .",
    "the initial data sets for these studies consist of an einstein - rosen bridge in the presence of a gravitational wave in the form originally considered by brill , and have been described extensively in ref .",
    "the gravitational wave is set up as a torus surrounding the black hole , and its location , amplitude , and shape can be varied essentially arbitrarily .",
    "the code used to evolve these data sets numerically has been discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the first case we study here is that of a black hole with a narrow ring of weak gravitational waves isolated from the hole initially . when this system is evolved , we expect the hole to become distorted slightly as the waves impinge on it , and then settle down to a schwarzschild hole with a larger mass afterwards .",
    "such a case provides a strong test of our methods as we must be able to track a horizon that begins essentially as a sphere , develops a distortion as it is hit by a nonspherical wave , and returns to a sphere after a long integration .    in fig .",

    "[ fig : pertarea]a , representing a spherical surface some distance outside the apparent horizon .",

    "the two surfaces exponentially approach each other , and this separation becomes less than a grid zone at @xmath49 .",
    "note that at this time , this one - grid - point - wide horizon - containing region is entirely outside the ah .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : pertarea]a , we also show other test surfaces as long dashed lines which are well outside or inside the horizon - containing region .",
    "all these test surfaces coincide to much less than 1/10th of the grid separation ( corresponding to typical proper distances between the surfaces of less than @xmath50 ) for the range @xmath51 to @xmath52 .",
    "the insert shows an expanded view of the early time .",
    "all surfaces computed are shown , but they are completely indistinguishable in spite of their extremely different starting positions , clearly showing the power and stability of this method . for all practical purposes ,",
    "this surface can be regarded as the eh . at @xmath51 the ah and eh practically coincide with each other . then the eh foresees the coming of the wave and expands .",
    "as the wave is falling in , after about @xmath53 , the ah starts to expand and catch up .",
    "the behavior of the ah and eh are exactly as expected .",
    "( we note that the area of the hole continues to drift up after 40 m .",
    "this is a well known numerical inaccuracy due to the development of a sharp peak in the radial metric component .",
    "this effect is in the background spacetime and is unrelated to our schemes for locating the horizon . )    in fig .",
    "[ fig : pertarea]b , we show the maximum separation over the whole surface between the outer and inner boundary of the horizon - containing region versus time ( maximum among the angular zones ) .",
    "the vertical axis is in terms of grid separation .",
    "as marked by squares , the maximum separation exponentially decreases down to 1 , at @xmath48 , then keeps decreasing to @xmath24 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 of a grid zone by @xmath58 , and @xmath59 respectively .",
    "again , for all practical purposes the outer and inner boundary of the horizon - containing region coincide , and the region can be regarded simply as the location of the eh for earlier times .",
    "we also note that at @xmath51 for the present case , the eh surface is found to be geometrically spherical ( using the tools described in the second paper in this series ) to within 1 part in @xmath60 .",
    "finally , we also compare the result of our backward photon method to our surface method in fig .",
    "[ fig : pertarea]c .",
    "we show the coordinate location of the surfaces integrated directly according to eq .",

    "the results are indistinguishable , as they coincide to within 0.05 grid zones throughout the evolution .",
    "we note that we have also compared the results of the forward integration technique described in ref .",
    "@xcite to our backward methods . for this forward integration technique to determine the eh to similar accuracy as we have done here",
    ", however , would take around @xmath61 times more cpu time than our backwards integration methods .",
    "next we briefly consider a more strongly distorted non - rotating black hole , providing a test of our methods in the more nonspherical and highly dynamic regime . in this case",
    "we choose initial data parameters ( @xmath62,@xmath31,@xmath63,@xmath64 ) = ( 1.0,0,1.5,2 ) in the language of ref .",
    "this black hole is significantly more distorted than the previous case ( the ratio of the polar to equatorial circumference of the apparent horizon is 4.26 at the initial time ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : distortcoord ] we show the maximum width of the horizon - containing region over all angular zones .",
    "the initial width of the horizon contain region at @xmath48 , chosen in the same manner as above , is 10 grid zones .",
    "we see that this highly non - spherical case is no different from the previous cases .",
    "the width of the horizon containing region decreases exponentially as a function of time , being less than 1 grid zone at @xmath65 and being only @xmath66 at @xmath51 .",
    "again , we mark the points where the width of the region is @xmath24,@xmath54 , and @xmath67th of a zone in the figure .",
    "the last single black hole cases we consider are rotating black holes .",
    "rotating black holes are expected to be the end point of all astrophysical black hole systems , so they are essential cases to be considered .",
    "rotation adds a new dimension to the problem , as new metric elements are involved , another polarization of the gravitational wave is present , and horizon generators will now be dragged around the black hole due to its angular momentum .",
    "furthermore , the horizon of a kerr black hole is not spherical , but is oblate , with the oblateness related to the rotation parameter of the hole  @xcite . for these reasons",
    "the rotating case provides not only an important testbed , but also a rich area for the study of horizon dynamics .",

    "we note that although the coordinate shapes of these rotating black hole horizons are fairly spherical , their intrinsic geometries are highly distorted . for an analytic kerr spacetime ,",
    "if the rotation parameter exceeds a critical value of @xmath73 , the horizon geometry becomes so distorted that it can not be embedded into a euclidean space  @xcite .",

    "this opens up the possibility of studying the dynamics of event horizons in numerical relativity .",
    "our methods allow the determination of the horizon location to exceptional accuracy , even in highly distorted dynamical black holes involving strong gravitational waves , rapidly rotating black holes , and colliding black holes . due to the convergence properties of null surfaces",

    "the precise width of this region is unimportant , as it exponentially decreases backwards in time . in particular",
