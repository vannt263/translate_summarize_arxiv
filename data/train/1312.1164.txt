    "[ fig4 ] ) and ( @xmath1 ) @xmath119 ( fig . [ fig4b ] ) . comparing with the monolayer graphene hall bar of ref .",
    "we see that the bend resistances in this system are smaller which is due to the constant dos in bilayer graphene . figs . [ fig4](a ) and ( b ) show that for @xmath120 bend resistances are none zero for a certain range of magnetic fields around @xmath121 .",
    "for these values of applied potential @xmath117 both sides of the junction are n - type , therefore electrons that transmit through the pn - interface will preserve its direction of motion in the other region of the junction . from fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) we see that if there is no pn - junction , i.e. @xmath122 , @xmath112 is symmetric in the magnetic field as a consequence of the symmetry of the hall device .",
    "however , introducing the pn - junction this symmetry is broken and the symmetric behavior of @xmath112 is gone as seen for @xmath123 .",
    "now , the cyclotron radius on the left and the right side of the junction are different and this will affect all transmission coefficients and resistances . for @xmath124 the cyclotron radius on the right side of the junction will be more than twice smaller than the one on the left side.the effect of it is reflected in the resistances @xmath112 and @xmath116 , presented in figs .",
    "[ fig4](a ) and ( b ) , respectively , which are highly asymmetric .",
    "this can be also observed in the plots of the electron current density shown in figs .",
    "[ fig4](c)-(e ) .",
    "these plots show the flow density of carriers in the structure and represent a valuable tool for understanding the resistances .",
    "we see that at point 1 , with @xmath125 , shown in the bottom fig .",
    "[ fig4](c ) electrons that are injected from lead 4 on the side of the junction having potential @xmath117 are unable to cross the pn - interface and the majority of them are guided to lead 2 .",
    "this affects @xmath112 because @xmath126 , as seen from eq . .",
    "if we decrease the magnetic field the cyclotron radius will increase and more electrons will be scattered to the perpendicular leads .",
    "if on the other hand the magnetic field is increased , a higher percentage of electrons is scattered back to the lead of injection - hence a peak around @xmath127 .",
    "decrease of the magnetic field leads to a higher probability that electrons will be scattered into the perpendicular leads .",
    "this will give rise to @xmath128 while @xmath129 decreases as well as the total @xmath112 . at",
    "@xmath121 bend resistance drops to zero which means that the same amount of electrons is scattered to the perpendicular leads as to the opposite ones .",
    "change of sign of @xmath112 with the change of sign of @xmath130 tells us that now electrons injected from lead 4 are no longer bending towards the pn - interface but towards the perpendicular leads .",
    "similar observations can be made for points 2 and 3 , with @xmath131 and @xmath132 , respectively . comparing the transmission coefficient @xmath133 for these two situations we can understand the presence of the decrease of the resistance around @xmath132 .",
    "if we apply @xmath134 electrons injected from lead 1 are scattered toward all other leads , increase of @xmath130 beyond @xmath131 leads to smaller cyclotron radius which results in a more directional flow of electrons towards lead 4 and consequently @xmath135 .",
    "we see that @xmath128 is relatively large in both cases while @xmath136 is very low .",
    "depending on the value of @xmath133 the bend resistance @xmath112 decreases ( @xmath137 ) or increases towards 0 ( @xmath138 ) .",
    "again , for very large field the majority of electrons are scattered back to the lead of injection and @xmath112 drops to 0 .",
    "behavior of @xmath116 can be explained in a similar way .",
    "resistance @xmath116 is obtained by switching the current and the voltage probes of the @xmath112 measurement setup .",
    "therefore , we can say that @xmath139 and the electron density plots of injection from leads 2 and 3 are needed for a detailed interpretation of the results .",
    "[ fig4](b ) shows similar features as fig . [",
    "fig4](a ) but for the opposite direction of magnetic field .",
    "these figures also show that as @xmath112 decreases with increase of @xmath117 , @xmath116 shows the opposite behavior which happens because now there is a different mechanism .",
    "electrons under negative magnetic field bend towards the perpendicular leads while if a positive magnetic field is applied electrons bend towards the pn - interface which increases @xmath140 .",
    "this is opposite to the case of @xmath112 .",
    "[ fig4b](a ) and ( b ) show the bend resistances in the case of @xmath141 .",
    "for these values of applied potential the right side of the junction is p - type , therefore , electrons injected from the n - region after passing the pn - interface will transform into a hole state and reverse its direction of motion . consequently , the snake states appear along the pn - junction .",
    "electrons reflected at the boundary will perform skipping orbits , as shown in the left part of fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) , while if it is transmitted it will perform a `` snake - like '' movement along the pn - interface as presented in the right part of fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) .",
    "this will have a dramatic impact on the resistances .",
    "as shown in the figures the bend resistances have very high negative values for magnetic field of certain sign .",
    "but if we reverse the direction of the magnetic field the behavior of the bend resistances change significantly .",
    "this can be explained using figs .",
    "[ fig4b](c)-(e ) where we show electron current density plots for three values of applied magnetic field indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig4b](a ) as 1 , 2 , 3 with @xmath142 , respectively .",
    "[ fig4b](c ) shows that for magnetic field @xmath127 most of the electrons injected from lead 1 will end up in lead 2 , which makes @xmath133 large .",
    "this situation is similar to the case of fig .",
    "[ fig4](c ) , but here injection from lead 4 shows a different behavior .",
    "unlike the situation presented in fig .",
    "[ fig4](c ) the right side of the junction is now p - type and the holes injected in this region are moving in opposite direction than the electrons and most of them end up in lead 3 making @xmath128 large , while the transmission towards opposite leads is very low . for high negative magnetic fields we have @xmath143 , and",
    "this is the reason for its high negative value .",
    "[ fig4b](d ) shows the situation @xmath144 .",
    "notice the different nature of bilayer graphene compared with monolayer graphene .",
    "bilayer graphene does nt exhibit the klein tunneling phenomena , and transmission of particles through the potential step is zero for normal incidence .",
    "this can be observed in fig .",
    "[ fig4b](d ) in case of injection from lead 1 .",
    "when the magnetic field is absent electrons move in straight lines and most of them arrive to the pn - interface with small incident angle and will be largely reflected back . if positive magnetic field is applied , as in fig .",
    "[ fig4b](e ) , we see the appearance of snake states@xcite in the case of injection from lead 4 . these states are characteristic for the graphene pn - junctions .",
    "electron injected in n - region along the pn - interface in the presence of the magnetic field will bend towards the pn - interface .",
    "if it passes through the p - region they change direction , and again bends towards the pn - interface and in this manner moves along it .",
    "we see that a large portion of particles injected from lead 4 forms snake states , and are guided along the pn - interface and end up in terminal 2 .",
    "now @xmath128 becomes very low while @xmath129 increases significantly and @xmath112 becomes positive .",
    "another difference with the single layer case can be seen in plots of the bend resistances shown in figs . [ fig4b](a ) and ( b ) . for the potential step height larger than the fermi energy",
    "we see that the peaks are shifted and they occur for nonzero magnetic field while for single layer graphene ( see fig . 3 of ref .",
    ") they were found at b = 0 .",
    "reason for this is the absence of klein tunneling .",
    "while for monolayer graphene @xmath145 was largest for @xmath121 , in the case of bilayer graphene we see that for @xmath121 the transmission @xmath146 . this effect together with the snake states causes a shifting of the peaks away from zero magnetic field .",
    "the hall resistances @xmath147 and @xmath148 shown in figs .",
    "[ fig2](a ) and ( b ) for the potential step smaller than the fermi energy exhibit plateau - like features , similarly as in the case of single layer graphene .",
    "these features are caused by the angle restrictions imposed by snell s law allowing only a certain range of incident angles to transmit through the pn - interface .",
    "compared with the single layer case these features are less expressed here as a consequence of the square root dependence in eq . .",
    "another important difference with the single layer case is that the hall resistance is no longer antisymmetric with respect to a sign reversal of the magnetic field .",
    "this can be understood from the transmission plots shown in figs .",
    "[ fig1](c ) and ( d ) .",
    "we see that for @xmath149 transmission is very high for all angles , while for @xmath150 the range of allowed angles is smaller where the transmission is still high .",
    "consequently , the difference between transmission from region 1 to region 2 for the opposite situation is increased .",
    "this can be clearly seen in figs . [",
    "fig2](c ) and ( d ) .",
    "due to this effect we have @xmath151 and consequently @xmath152 .",
    "one can use similar reasoning to find @xmath153 .",
    "therefore , all symmetry relations found in ref . in case of single layer graphene , e.g. @xmath154 and @xmath155 , are no longer valid ( except : @xmath156 and @xmath157 ) .",
    "nevertheless , figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] show that the resistances still obey those symmetries approximately .",
    "when applying a potential @xmath141 in the right region causes the appearance of hole states .",
    "change of direction of carrier movement has a strong impact on the hall resistance .",
    "its influence is explained in figs . [ fig3](c ) and ( d ) .",
    "[ fig3](c ) shows electron current density plots when the magnetic field @xmath125 is applied .",
    "the highest percentage of electrons injected from terminal 1 will end up in lead 2 and @xmath133 will be large .",
    "this transmission coefficient will give a negative contribution to @xmath147 .",
    "holes injected from lead 3 will preferably end up also in lead 2 , as a consequence of the opposite direction of motion .",
    "this makes @xmath158 large and increases @xmath147 , because @xmath158 gives a positive contribution to this resistance .",
    "therefore , in this set up injection from the n - region will decrease @xmath147 while injection from the p - region will increase it . if @xmath159 is applied , as presented in fig .",
    "[ fig3](d ) , we see that the situation is changed .",
    "now , injection from the left region will increase @xmath147 , because the highest probability @xmath160 contributes positively to @xmath147 while injection from the right region decreases the resistance due to a negative contribution from @xmath161 . figs . [ fig3](a ) and ( b ) show that if @xmath162 is applied the hall resistances are always zero .",
    "this was also the case with the hall bar sculptured from a monolayer of graphene which is a consequence of the same cyclotron radius for electrons and holes in both region .",
    "the fact that electrons and holes move through the structure with the same orbiting radius but in different directions leads to @xmath163 , and hence @xmath164 .",
    "same reasoning can be applied for the magnetic field dependence of @xmath148 .",
    "[ v_array ] shows the dependence of the bend resistance , @xmath112 , and hall resistance , @xmath147 , as a function of the applied potential @xmath117 .",
    "first noticeable feature is that @xmath147 is always zero as expected having in mind that there is no applied magnetic field .",
    "behavior of @xmath112 can be explained in a simple way .",
    "scattering of an electron on a potential step is expressed by eq . which tells us that as @xmath165 approaches zero there are less particles that can satisfy this condition and therefore will be reflected back . from the figure",

    "we will see how resistances will change if a band gap opens in the second region .",
    "interestingly , for @xmath122 and @xmath121 there is a minimal resistivity of the device if the band gap is opened in the second region , as shown in fig .",
    "[ res_dvc ] .",
    "all bend and hall resistances drop to very small values ( almost zero ) .",
    "reason for this lies in the fact that for these parameters the particles that are injected from the leads perpendicular to the pn - interface ( 1,3 ) are evenly distributed over all four leads , while for the case of injection from leads parallel to the pn - interface ( 2,4 ) half of the injected particles end up in the opposite lead ( 4,2 ) while the rest is almost evenly divided between the perpendicular leads .",

    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig4b ] we see that by opening a gap the resistances that suffer the most changes are the ones for which the potential @xmath117 lies around the fermi energy .",
    "this is not surprising having in mind different transmission probabilities for these values of @xmath117 .",
    "transmissions for gapless and gapped bilayer graphene show the largest difference around @xmath50 , and as we move away from it they become very similar .",
    "still , the behavior of the resistances did nt change in a significant way .",
    "again , all bend resistances show an asymmetric behavior for different signs of the magnetic field , for @xmath141 , which happens as a consequence of the snake states that appear when the hole states are present in the second region , as explained previously , while for the case @xmath169 bend resistances are nonzero only for a certain range around @xmath121 .    figs . [ res_gap_1](c)-(e ) show electron current density plots for the same three points as in fig .",

    "on the other hand , starting from this point we see a much faster decay of @xmath112 with magnetic field when the gap is open in the second region .",

    "[ fig4](d ) and [ res_gap_1](d ) we observe higher electron densities in the perpendicular leads when the band gap is opened in the second region .",
    "increase of the magnetic field beyond its value at point 2 leads to a decrease of resistances , as it was for @xmath170 .",
    "decrease is slower in this case which can be seen at point 3 , which shows higher resistance than in the configuration with no gap in the second region .",
    "this is a consequence of a much more unidirectional transport of electrons in this case .",

    "point 2 given in the same figure shows that the peak is shifted closer to zero magnetic field when the band gap is opened .",
    "generally this happens because the cyclotron radius becomes smaller when the band gap opens due to a shift of bands away from @xmath117 . in order to have the same cyclotron radius as in the case of gapless graphene smaller magnetic fields need to be applied .",
    "quantitatively , all peaks in fig .",

    "hall plateau - like features are almost completely absent , the only trace of it can be spotted for @xmath172 , when @xmath171 , because only for small values of @xmath173 snell s law will restrict the range of incident angles for which transmission is possible in a significant way so it would be visible in the plot .",

    "plots show very high symmetry in the case of injection from leads 1 and 3 .",
    "if the second region is p - type the hall resistance firstly increases with increase of the magnetic field up to some point after which it starts to decrease towards zero which happens because the carriers are moving in the opposite direction in the different regions of the junction , as was explained earlier .",

    "[ res_dv ] shows the change in resistances when we tune the band gap size .",
    "plots are made for a system with potential step @xmath175 .",
    "notice that the bend resistances are not altered in a significant way when the gap size is varied between @xmath176 and @xmath177 .",
    "reason for this is the slow variation of cyclotron radius with the band gap size in case of a large potential @xmath117 .",
    "cyclotron radius is given by @xmath178^{1/2}$ ] which means that by changing the band gap from @xmath179 to @xmath180 the change in cyclotron radius is only @xmath181 .",
    "having in mind that the bend resistances depend quadratically on the percentage of particles that transmits to the opposite leads ( @xmath182 , @xmath183 , etc .. ) it is not surprising that they are not changed significantly with changing band gap size , especially for small magnetic fields for which the probability that the particle will end up in the opposite lead is very high .",
    "if we look at the plots of the hall resistances given in figs .",
    "[ res_dv](c)-(d ) we see that the increase of the band gap size is followed with an increase of the hall resistance . if there is no band gap in the second region we have a pn - junction with electrons on one side rotating with a cyclotron radius @xmath184 and holes on the other side of the junction rotating with the same radius but in the opposite direction , resulting in a zero hall resistance for all values of the magnetic field because of the symmetry in the injection from leads 1 and 3 .",
    "injection from one lead will give rise to the hall resistance , while the injection from the other one will decrease it .",
    "introducing a band gap in the second region breaks this symmetry which leads to a nonzero hall resistance .",
    "plots show that the behavior of the hall resistances follow the one obtained in fig .",
    "[ rhg_2 ] .",
    "next , we show how the bend resistance @xmath112 and the hall resistance @xmath147 are affected by changing the potential @xmath117 .",
    "[ res_dvg ] shows the behavior of the resistances @xmath112 and @xmath147 for different values of @xmath185 and different applied potential in the second region .",
    "the bend resistance , given in fig . [ res_dvg](a ) , exhibit a steeper drop as the size of the band gap is increased .",
    "again , we can find that the shape of the resistances follow the angle restriction imposed by snell s law ( @xmath186^{1/4}$ ] ) .",
    "when the charge - neutrality point ( cnp ) is crossed the decrease of the resistances is slowed down indicating the presence of two type of carriers moving in opposite directions preventing @xmath112 to reach zero value .",
    "the hall resistance , on the other hand , shows an increase as the band gap is introduced . when the band gap is set to zero @xmath147",
    "is zero due to the absence of magnetic field .",
    "if we introduce the band gap in the second region we see that @xmath147 becomes none zero which increases as @xmath117 approaches the fermi energy .",
    "this happens because the pn - interface acts like a guide , electrons are unable to cross it but instead are guided to the perpendicular leads .",
    "chiral states appearing inside the gap ( see fig . [ chrl ] ) can only move along the pn - interface and are therefore disconnected from the two perpendicular leads .",
    "there contribution to conduction can be measured by a to - terminal measurement .",
    "the result of such a calculation was presented in fig .",
    "14 of ref .",
    "we investigated the electronic response of a hall bar structure sculptured from a bilayer of graphene containing a pn - junction .",
    "simulations were done for bilayer graphene without a band gap as well as for the situation when a band gap is opened using different potentials on the top and bottom layer of the material .",
    "the hall and bend resistances were calculated using the billiard model and the results were compared with the ones obtained for single layer hall bars .",
    "although these two materials have very different properties , e.g. different energy spectrums , the absence of veselango effect and klein tunneling in bilayer graphene , etc . , results exhibit high resemblance but with some fundamental differences .",
    "simulations showed similarly as for the systems of single layer graphene two different transport regimes : @xmath0 ) when both regions of the junction are n - type and , @xmath1 ) when one side of the junction is n - type while the other one is p - type .",
    "the first case showed that the hall resistances dominate .",
    "hall plateau - like features can be observed but unlike the single layer case they are not so strongly pronounced .",
    "reason for this was found in the square - root energy dependence appearing in snell s law .",
    "the second case when one of the sides of the junction is p - type showed highly asymmetric magnetic field dependence of the bend resistance .",
    "this behavior was also seen in the plots of the resistances in refs . and",
    "as a consequence of the snake states emerging along the pn - interface",
    ". however , bilayer graphene shows a peak shifted away from @xmath121 which was explained with the essentially different property of these two materials , i.e. the absence of klein tunneling in bilayer graphene ( furthermore , transmission is zero for normal incidence ) but the highest transmission is achieved for particular nonzero incident angles .",
    "if we open a band gap in the second region resistances do not show dramatic changes .",
    "however , we saw that the opening of a gap almost completely removes the hall plateau - like features in the hall resistances for @xmath169 as well as the minimal resistivity of a device for @xmath121 .",
    "we also examined the dependence of the hall resistance @xmath147 and the bend resistance @xmath112 versus the applied potential and the band gap size .",
    "plots suggest connection in the behavior of the bend resistance with the angle restrictions imposed by snell s law .",
    "the hall resistance showed nonzero values for @xmath121 when the band gap is opened which occurs because the pn - interface guides the electrons to the perpendicular leads and consequently increases @xmath147 .",
