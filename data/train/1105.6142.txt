    "<S> , the gas may accrete as magnetically confined blobs diffusing through field lines in the region very close to the black hole horizon , which is similar to those in compact stars . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations are also valid for the case that the inner adaf connects to the outer cold thin disk at a certain radius . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the advection of the external fields is quite inefficient in the outer thin disk due to its low radial velocity , and the field lines thread the disk almost vertically , while these field lines can be efficiently dragged inward by the radial motion of the inner adaf . </S>"
