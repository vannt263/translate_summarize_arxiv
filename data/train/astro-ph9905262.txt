    "the standard cosmological models rest mainly on a homogeneous and spherically symmetric roberston - walker metric @xmath3 , subject to the einstein equations , with a matter - energy tensor depending only on the parameter ( called the cosmic time ) labelling the 3-surfaces .",
    "+ the particular choice of one model lies in the choice of an equation of state .",
    "inflationary cosmologies are part of this framework with peculiar choices of the equation of state imported from particle physics .",
    "departures from this standard framework are developed for instance by the use of generalizations of the einstein equations or by taking into account inhomogeneities in the matter distribution . whereas there are presently no compelling reasons to abandon the einstein equations , the introduction of inhomogeneities is unavoidable since there are large and small - scale structures in the observed universe .",
    "these inhomogeneities induce inhomogeneities in the metric .",
    "they are used for the study of the formation of galaxies and large scale structures and of the fluctuations of the cosmic background at 3@xmath4 ( cmbr ) . in these models",
    "the metric @xmath5 is a weakly perturbed robertson - walker metric : @xmath6 . in this framework",
    "the perturbation @xmath7 is generally small and depends on the spatial coordinates , but the main term @xmath3 , characterized by a scale parameter @xmath8 is independent of position .",
    "therefore the cosmological singularity @xmath9 is an equal time 3-surface ; in astronomical terms , the age of the universe is the same everywhere .",
    "+ solutions of the einstein equations with inhomogeneous @xmath9 hyper - surfaces have been studied analytically by tolman ( 1934 ) and bondi ( 1947 ) .",
    "the tolman - bondi universes have applied to cosmological contexts such as clusters of galaxies ( tarentola , 1976 ) or the cmbr dipole ( paczynski and piran , 1990 ) . + but the parameters of the model are then set in such a way that they lead to a spatially homogeneous @xmath9 big bang singular surface .",
    "there are no more reasons for this choice than for a strictly homogenous matter and radiation distribution .",
    "for instance , if the present universe were the result of the bounce from a collapse prior to the standard big bang ( a solution which can not be excluded ) , a strictly homogeneous @xmath9 surface would result from a very unlikely fine tuning .",
    "+ in a recent work ( clrier & schneider , 1998 ) , we have identified a class of inhomogeneous models of universe , with a big - bang of `` delayed '' type , solving the standard horizon problem without need for an inflationary phase . in the present paper ,",
    "we investigate the application of a peculiar model of this class to the cmbr anisotropy .",
    "+ from a purely geometrical point of view , it is always possible to re - label the 3-surfaces so as to make the hyper - surface @xmath9 independent of @xmath1 .",
    "but such an arbitrary re - labelling is forbidden by the description of physical phenomena by the schrdinger equation in curved space time .",
    "this equation , which gives the rate of evolution of phenomena , in particular , the thermal history of the universe ( through nucleosynthesis of light elements and matter - radiation decoupling ) , provides , in an inhomogeneous universe , a clock imposing on time - like world lines a given time coordinate .",
    "each hamiltonian used in the schrdinger equation gives a different time scale ( _ e.g. _ the atomic transition rates ) which depends on the local curvature .",
    "but there is an implicit postulate , that there is a fundamental time scale , the planck time @xmath10 .",
    "thus , the time coordinate can only be , with the choice of a given time unit , rescaled globally with a universal affine transformation @xmath11 where the coefficient @xmath12 and @xmath13 are independent on @xmath1 and @xmath14 .",
    "+ the dipole moment in the cmbr anisotropy is the most prominent feature in the recent observational data , as probed by the four years cobe experiments .. all experiments provide maps of small temperature fluctuations from an average 2.73@xmath15 k for the cmbr . ]",
    "it overcomes the quadrupole , of order 5.10@xmath16 , by more than two orders of magnitude , its value being of order 10@xmath17 ( smoot et al . , 1992 ; kogut et al . ,",
    "this dipole is usually considered as resulting from a doppler effect produced by our motion with respect to the cmbr rest - frame ( partridge , 1988 ) . a few authors ( gunn , 1988 ; paczynski &   piran , 1990 ; turner , 1991 ; langlois &   piran , 1996 ; langlois , 1996 ) , in the recent past , intended however to show that its origin could be in the large scale features of the universe .",
    "+ paczynski and piran ( 1990 ) , using an ad hoc toy model , emphasized the possibility for the dipole to be generated by an entropy gradient in a tolman - bondi dust universe . in the peculiar model they did study , they have assumed that the time of the big - bang was the same for all observers .",
    "+ hereafter we show that the dipole , and quadrupole , anisotropy , or part of it , could be considered as the outcome of a conic big - bang surface .",
    "we first describe , in the following section , the special tolman - bondi model we use for our derivation . the calculations will be developed in sect.3 and the results exposed in sect.4 .",
    "our conclusions and a brief discussion are given in sect .",
    "we consider here the light cone emitted from the last scattering surface - temperature of order 4.10@xmath18 k - towards the earth at our present time .",
    "since this period is matter dominated - the radiation was dynamically relevant only at times prior to a temperature of order 10@xmath19 k - we are considering the behaviour of a photon gas immersed into an universe satisfying + @xmath20 + that is , we neglect the radiation as source of gravitational field .",
    "+ we then choose a tolman - bondi ( tolman , 1934 ; bondi , 1947 ) model which figures out a dust ( ideal non zero rest mass pressureless gas ) dominated , spatially spherically symmetrical inhomogeneous universe .",
    "+ the bondi line element , in co - moving coordinates and proper time , is : @xmath21    it reduces to the usual friedmann - robertson - walker metric for a homogeneous universe .",
    "+ solving einstein equations for this metric gives : @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 a dot denoting differentiation with respect to @xmath14 and a prime differentiation with respect to @xmath1 .",
    "+ @xmath25 is the energy density @xmath26 + @xmath27 and @xmath28 are arbitrary functions of @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath27 can be interpreted as the total energy per unit mass and @xmath28 as the baryonic mass within the sphere of co - moving radial coordinate @xmath1 . @xmath28 remaining constant with time , we use it to define the radial coordinate : @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is a constant .",
    "+ eq.(3 ) can be solved and gives a parametric expression for @xmath31 in case @xmath32 and an analytic one in case @xmath33 .",
    "+ we retain the flat universe model @xmath33 and the analytic expression : + @xmath34^{1/3}[t - t_0(r)]^{2/3}$ ] + which , with the above definition for the radial coordinate , becomes : @xmath35^{2/3 }   \\label{5}\\ ] ]    the homogeneous limit of our model is the einstein - de sitter universe with @xmath36 .",

    "( 5 ) thus becomes : @xmath41    the specific entropy @xmath42 is usually defined as the ratio of the number density of photons over the number density of baryons : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the baryon mass and @xmath45 , the boltzmann constant .    in order to decouple the effect of inhomogeneous entropy distribution (",

    "+ the observed deviation of the cmbr from a perfect homogeneous pattern being very small , we can assume , as a reasonable approximation , thermodynamical equilibrium for the photons , so as to write , at the ultra - relativistic limit for bosons : @xmath47 @xmath48 being the radiation temperature and + letting , with no loss of generality , @xmath49 , and taking the present photon to baryon density ratio @xmath50 to be @xmath51 , we derive the following expression for @xmath48 : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the hubble constant in units 100 km / s / mpc .",
    "hereafter , for numerical applications , we take @xmath53 = 0.75 .",
    "let an observer , for example the cobe satellite , be located at @xmath54 where the average temperature is @xmath55 , of order 2.7 @xmath4 .",

    "+ the light travelling from the last scattering surface to this observer follows null geodesics which we are going to numerically integrate , from the observer , until we reach this surface defined by its temperature @xmath57 .",
