    "majorization and log - majorization are powerful and versatile tools for proving trace and norm inequalities ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite for overviews on the topic ) . a fundamental property of unitarily invariant norms ( including schatten @xmath0-norms and the trace norm ) can be roughly stated as follows : +    ( @xmath1 ) +    a natural approach to prove norm inequalities for general unitarily invariant norms then proceeds as follows : first , the desired inequality is shown for the operator norm where such inequalities often boil down to operator inequalities and are easier to prove .",
    "next , it is shown using antisymmetric tensor power calculus that the operator norm inequality implies log - majorization and thus weak majorization of the eigenvalues .",

    "since log - majorization implies weak majorization , the relation  ( @xmath1 ) allows us to lift   to arbitrary unitarily invariant norms , including the trace .",
    "in fact , log - majorization is stronger than weak majorization and thus allows us to derive stronger norm inequalities ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the use of the antisymmetric tensor power approach has so far been restricted to matrix functions made from operations of products , absolute values and powers ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ( explained above ) and  @xcite ) . in this work",

    "@xmath19 however , known results for majorization or log - majorization in the spirit of ( @xmath1 ) do not apply to   due to the integral average of vectors on the right - hand side .    in sections  [ sec : mainweak ] we extend ( @xmath1 ) to the case of weak majorization relations where the right - hand side contains an integral average of vectors .",
