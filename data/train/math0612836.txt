    "the purpose of this note is to bring out the essence involved in the existence theorems for the limiting free energy in several random energy models .",
    "basically , they are corollaries to the large deviation principle ( ldp ) obeyed by certain empirical measures coupled with varadhan s lemma .",
    "since this note is addressed to probabilists , the results are first formulated in the large deviation setting and then the consequences to the spin glass models are explained in each section . at the first sight it may appear that the large deviation principles proved here are nothing but the well known principles for empirical measures , but however a little reflection shows that it is not so . for large deviation terminology , we refer to @xcite .",
    "we could have given the most general result of section 5 and then deduced all the results from it .",
    "instead , we decided to go from simple model to the more general one , so that it is easier for the reader to follow .",
    "let @xmath0 be a sequence of probabilities on the real line @xmath1 .",
    "assume that @xmath2 and satisfy large deviation principle with a convex rate function @xmath3 on @xmath1 .",
    "for every @xmath4 , suppose @xmath5 be i.i.d .",

    "the limit , @xmath49 when exists , is called the free energy of the system .    now suppose @xmath50 is a sequence of probabilities as above and @xmath51 where for fixed @xmath4 , @xmath52 are i.i.d .",

    "weibull distributions can also be considered @xcite .",
    "it is clear that symmetry of the distributions does not play any role .",
    "it is also easy to see that when the random variables are , moreover , non negative then there is no phase transition .",

    "the only complications , again , are in calculating @xmath126 .",
    "see next section .    in bkm@xcite",
    ", we have hamiltonian @xmath127 where @xmath128 are non - negative weights . again",

    ", they do not consider all non - empty subsets of @xmath109 , rather , some sub collection .",
    "but that can be achieved by taking some weights @xmath129 to be zero appropriately .",
    "further , if one considers a chain like @xmath130 and takes non zero weights @xmath129 for @xmath118 only in the chain , one gets grem .",
