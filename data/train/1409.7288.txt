    "evolutionary games become a central tool for predicting and even design evolution in many fields .",
    "its origins come from biology where it was introduced by @xcite to model conflicts among animals .",
    "it differs from classical game theory by its focusing on the evolution dynamics of the fraction of members of the population that use a given strategy , and in the notion of evolutionary stable strategy ( ess , @xcite ) which includes robustness against a deviation of a whole ( possibly small ) fraction of the population who may wish to deviate .",
    "this is in contrast with the standard nash equilibrium concept that only incorporates robustness against deviation of a single user .",
    "it became perhaps the most important mathematical tool for describing and modeling evolution since darwin .",
    "indeed , on the importance of the ess for understanding the evolution of species , dawkins writes in his book `` the selfish gene '' @xcite : `` we may come to look back on the invention of the ess concept as one of the most important advances in evolutionary theory since darwin . ''",
    "he further specifies : \" maynard smith s concept of the ess will enable us , for the first time , to see clearly how a collection of independent selfish entities can come to resemble a single organised whole . in this paper , we identify inherent restrictions on the modeling capacity of classical evolutionary games apply .",
    "recently , the evolutionary game theory has become of increased interest to social scientists @xcite . in computer science , evolutionary game theory is appearing , some examples of applications can be found in multiple access protocols @xcite , multihoming@xcite and resources competition in the internet @xcite .",
    "the starting point of this theory is a situation of a very large number of local pairwise interactions between pairs of individuals that are randomly matched . in classical evolutionary games ( eg ) , each individual represents a selfish player in a non - cooperative game that it plays with its randomly matched adversary , and in which each player seeks to maximize its utility .",
    "the originality of eg is in postulating that this utility is the darwinian fitness .",
    "the fitness should be understood as the relative rate at which the behavior used by the individual will increase . for a given share of behaviors in the population , a behavior of an individual with a higher fitness would thus result in a higher rate of its reproduction .",
    "we make the observation that since classical eg associates with an individual both the interactions with other individuals as well as the fitness , then it is restricted to describing populations in which the individual is the one that is responsible for the reproduction and where the choice of its own strategies is completely selfish . in biology , in some species like bees or ants , the one who interacts is not the one who reproduces .",
    "this implies that the darwinian fitness is related to the entire swarm and not to a single bee and thus , standard eg models excludes these species in which the single individual which reproduces is not the one that interacts with other individuals .",
    "furthermore , in many species , we find altruistic behaviors , which may hurt the individual adopting it , favouring instead the group he belongs to .",
    "altruistic behaviors are typical of parents toward their children : they may incubate them , feed them or protect them from predator s at a high cost for themselves .",
    "another example can be found in flock of birds : when a bird sees a predator it gives an alarm call to warn the rest of the flock , attracting the predators attention to itself .",
    "also the stinging behavior of bees is an altruistic one : it serves to protect the hive , but its lethal for the bee which strives . in human behavior",
    ", many phenomena where individuals do care about other s benefits in their groups or about their intentions can be observed in the real word .",
    "it must be admitted that some phenomena require an explanation in terms of genes which pursue their own interest to the disadvantage of the individual .",
    "hence the assumption of selfishness becomes inconsistent with the real behavior of individual in a population .",
    "founders of classical eg seem to have been well aware of this problem .",
    "indeed , vincent writes in @xcite `` ants seem to completely subordinate any individual objectives for the good of the group . on the other hand ,",
    "the social foraging of hyenas demonstrates individual agendas within a tight - knit social group ( hofer and east , 2003 ) . as evolutionary games",
    ", one would ascribe strategies and payoffs to the ant colony , while ascribing strategies and payoffs to the individual hyenas of a pack . '' in the case of ants , the proposed solution is thus to model the ant colony as a player . within the ceg paradigm , this would mean that we have to consider interactions between ant colonies .",
    "this however does not allow us anymore to model behavior at the level of the individual .    in this work we present a new model for evolutionary games , in which the concept of the agent as a single individual is substituted by that of the agent as a whole group of individuals .",
    "this new concept , named group equilibrium stable strategy ( gess ) , allow to model competition between individuals in a population in which the whole group shares a common utility . even if we still consider pairwise interactions among individuals , our perspective is completely different",
    ": we suppose that individuals are simple actors of the game and that the utility to be maximized is the one of their group .",
    "our study of evolutionary games under the altruism inside each group , is built around the ess .",
    "we begin by defining the gess , deriving it in several ways and exploring its major characteristics .",
    "the main focus of this paper is to study how this new concept changes the profile of population and to explore the relationship between gess and nash equilibrium or ess .",
    "we characterize through the study of many gess and we show how the evolution and the equilibrium are influenced by the groups size as well as by their immediate payoff .",
    "we also provide some primary results through an example on multiple access games , in which any local interaction does not lead to same payoff depending on the type of individuals that are competing , and not only the strategy used . in such application , we evaluate the impact of altruism behavior on the performance of the system .    the paper is structured as follows .",
    "we first provide in the next section the needed background on evolutionary games . in the section [ nnceg ]",
    "we then study the new natural concept gess and the relationship between gess and ess or nash equilibrium .",
    "the characterization of the gess is studied in section [ angg ] .",
    "section [ examples ] provides some numerical illustration through some famous examples in evolutionary games . in section [ mac ]",
    "we study the multiple access control in slotted aloha under altruism behavior .",
    "the paper closes with a summary in section [ conc ]",
    "we consider an infinite population of players and we assume that each member of the population has the same set of available pure strategies @xmath0 .",
    "we suppose that each individual is repeatedly paired off with an other individual randomly selected within the population .",
    "a player may use a mixed strategy @xmath1 where @xmath2 . here",
    "@xmath3 is a probability measure over the set of actions @xmath4 .",
    "this is the case where an individual has the capacity to produce a variety in behaviours .",
    "alternatively , the mixed strategy @xmath3 can be interpreted as the vector of densities of individuals adopting a certain pure strategy , where @xmath5 is the fraction of the population using strategy @xmath6 .",
    "however the original formulation of evolutionary game theory were not required to make distinction between population - level and individual - level variability for infinite population @xcite .",
    "let now focus on the case of monomorphic populations in which each individual uses a mixed strategy .",
    "we define by @xmath7 the expected payoff for a tagged individual if it uses a mixed action @xmath3 when meeting another individual who adopts the mixed action @xmath8 .",
    "this payoff is called `` fitness '' and actions with larger fitness are expected to propagate faster in a population . if we define a payoff matrix @xmath9 and consider @xmath3 and @xmath8 to be column vectors , then @xmath10 and the payoff function @xmath11 is indeed linear in @xmath3 and @xmath8 . a mixed action @xmath8",
    "is called a nash equilibrium if @xmath12 in evolutionary games the most important concept of equilibrium is the ess , which was introduced by @xcite as a strategy that , if adopted by most members of a population , it is not invadable by mutant strategies in its suitably small neighbourhood .",
    "more precisely , we suppose that the whole population uses a strategy @xmath8 and that a small fraction @xmath13 of individuals ( _ mutants _ ) adopts another strategy @xmath3 .",
    "evolutionary forces are expected to select @xmath8 against @xmath3 if @xmath14 the definition of ess is thus related to a robustness property against deviations by a whole ( possibly small ) fraction of the population .",
    "this is an important difference that distinguishes the equilibrium in populations as seen by biologists and the standard nash equilibrium often used in economic context , in which robustness is defined against the possible deviation of a single user .",
    "why do we need the stronger type of robustness ? since we deal with large populations , it is likely to expect that from time to time , some group of individuals may deviate .",
    "thus robustness against deviations by a single user is not sufficient to ensure that deviations will not develop and end up being used by a growing portion of the population . by defining the ess through the following equivalent definition ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 2.1 ) or ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 6.4.1 , page 63 ) , it s possible to establish the relationship between ess and nash equilibrium ( ne ) .",
    "strategy @xmath8 is an ess if it satisfies the two conditions :    * nash equilibrium condition : @xmath15 * stability condition : + @xmath16    the first condition ( [ ess6 ] ) is the condition for a nash equilibrium .",
    "in fact , if condition ( [ ess6 ] ) is satisfied , then the fraction of mutations in the population will tend to decrease ( as it has a lower fitness , meaning a lower growth rate ) . thus the action @xmath17 is then immune to mutations . if it does not but if still the condition ( [ ess7 ] ) holds , then a population using @xmath17 is  weakly  immune against mutants using @xmath18 . indeed ,",
    "if the mutant s population grows , then we shall frequently have individuals with action @xmath17 competing with mutants .",
    "in such cases , the condition @xmath19 ensures that the growth rate of the original population exceeds that of the mutants .",
    "then an ess is a refinement of the nash equilibrium .",
    "in this section we present a new concept for evolutionary games , in which the idea of the player as a single individual is substituted by that of a player as a whole group of individuals .",
    "the interactions are among individuals but the objective function , which is maximized , is that of the group they belong to .",
    "we assume that the population is composed of @xmath20 groups , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , where the normalized size of @xmath21 is noted by @xmath23 with @xmath24 .    for clarity of presentation ,",
    "we restrict our analysis to pairwise interactions , where each individual can meet a member of its own group or of a different one .",
    "individuals dispose of a finite set of actions : @xmath25 .",
    "let @xmath26 be the probability that an individual in the group @xmath21 choses an action @xmath27 ; we associate to each group @xmath28 the vector of probabilities @xmath29 where @xmath30 . by assuming that each individual can interact with another individual with equal probability ,",
    "then the expected utility of a group ( player ) @xmath28 is : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the profile strategy of other groups and @xmath33 is the immediate expected reward of an individual player adopting strategy @xmath34 against an opponent playing @xmath35 .",
    "the definition of gess is related to the robustness property against deviations inside each group .",
    "there are two possible equivalent interpretations of an @xmath36 deviation in this context :    1 .   a small deviation in the strategy by all members of a group .",
    "if the group @xmath21 plays according to strategy @xmath37 , the @xmath38 deviation , where @xmath39 , consists in a shift to the group s strategy @xmath40 ; 2 .   the second is a deviation ( possibly ) large of a small number of individuals in a group @xmath21 , that means that a fraction @xmath13 of individuals in @xmath21 plays a different strategy @xmath41 .",
    "after an @xmath36deviation under both interpretations the profile of the whole population becomes @xmath42 .",
    "then the average payoff of group @xmath21 after mutation is given by : @xmath43    where @xmath44 .",
    "[ def2 ] a strategy @xmath45 is a gess if @xmath46 , @xmath47 , there exists some @xmath48 , which may depend on @xmath34 , such that for all @xmath49 @xmath50 where @xmath51 .    hence from equation ( [ ess1 ] ) , strategy @xmath8 is a gess if the two following conditions hold :    * @xmath52^m$ ] @xmath53 * @xmath54 such that : @xmath55    [ rem - gess - nash ] the condition ( [ cond2-gess ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath56 which is exactly the definition of the strict nash equilibrium of the game composed by @xmath20 groups in which each group maximises its own utility .",
    "here we analyse the relationship between the standard @xmath57 and our new concept @xmath58 .",
    "consider games whose immedaite expected reward is symmetric , i.e. @xmath59 . then any ess is a gess .",
    "let @xmath60 be an ess . combining the symmetry of the payoff function and equation ( [ cond1-gess ] ) , we get : @xmath61 where the second equality follows from the symmetry of the payoff function @xmath11 and the last inequality follows form the fact that @xmath8 is an ess and satisfies ( [ ess6 ] ) .",
    "this implies that @xmath8 satisfies the first condition of gess ( [ cond1-gess ] ) .",
    "now assume that @xmath62 for some @xmath63 , previous equations imply that @xmath64 .",
    "thus the second condition ( [ cond2-gess ] ) becomes @xmath65 which coincide with the second condition of ess ( [ ess7 ] ) .",
    "this completes the proof .      in the classical evolutionary games ,",
    "the ess is a refinement of a nash equilibrium and we can see that all esss are nash equilibria but not all nash equilibria are esss . in order to characterize this relationship in our context , let us define the game between groups : there are @xmath20 players in which each player has a finite set of pure strategies @xmath0 .",

    "but in our context , we address several questions on the relationship between the gess , ess and the nash equilibrium defined in ( [ ne ] ) .",
