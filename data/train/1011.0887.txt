    "suspension is an important mode for the transport of sediments by fluid flows .",
    "it occurs when the falling velocity of the particles is smaller than the turbulent velocity fluctuations , so that particles can remain suspended for a long time , trapped by turbulent eddies , before they eventually fall back on the bed due to gravity . in nature , one observes suspension in large rivers , _",
    "i.e. _ in their downstream part , where large amount of fine particles have been collected from the catchment basin .",
    "rivers that ordinarily present bed - load transport ( the moving particles remain close to the bed ) can also experience suspension ( the particles are present over the whole flow depth ) when the water discharge is unusually large , e.g. during flood events .",
    "vertical concentration profiles and overall sediment fluxes are among the major issues  see the pioneering works of rouse ( 1936 ) or vanoni ( 1946 ) . from the point of view of hydraulic engineering ,",
    "the problem is satisfactorily solved for rivers in a steady state , although some questions are still open , such as particle trapping by turbulent eddies , or the structure of the flow near the bottom where the concentration is large ( nielsen 1992 ; nezu 2005 ) . however , the response of the sediment flux to temporal or spatial changes of the flow is largely unknown .",
    "such changes may be induced , for instance , by long gravity waves , or a sudden increase of the flow rate , or variations of the river slope or geometry .",
    "two typical problems of relaxation downstream a change in the flow conditions are depicted in figure  [ fig : sketches ] , which will be studied in ",
    "[ sec : applic ] : that of a small change of the slope of the bottom ( fig .  [ fig : sketches]a ) , and that of a change of the bottom conditions , from non - erodible to erodible ( fig .  [ fig : sketches]b ) .",
    "the suspended sediment response is expected to have a strong effect on the dynamics of the erodible bottom , especially on the formation of dunes or bars , or , at larger scale , on the development of meanders ( seminara 2006 ) .",
    "specific relaxation problems have been investigated by numerical integration of the reynolds - averaged navier - stokes equations , using mixing length or @xmath6 turbulence models ( hjelmfelt & lenau 1970 ; jobson & sayre 1970 ; apmann and rumer 1970 ; van rijn 1986a ; celik & rodi 1988 ; ouillon & le guennec 1996 ) .",

    "this saturation corresponds to the homogeneous and steady state for which sediment transport is constant both in space and time for given flow conditions .",
    "such a first order equation was first introduced in the aeolian context , as the simplest equation describing relaxation effects ( sauermann , kroy & herrmann 2001 ; andreotti , claudin & douady 2002 ; kroy , sauermann & herrmann 2002 ; andreotti 2004 ) .",
    "it was then shown that , for water flows , this equation can be derived from analysis of the erosion and deposition rates , the relaxation scales being there related to particle deposition ( and not particle inertia ) ( charru 2006 ; lajeunesse , malverti & charru 2010 ) .",
    "the importance of the relaxation length @xmath19 appeared to be crucial in particular for stability analyses of the erodible bottom , for selection of the ripple wavelength ( fourrire , claudin & andreotti 2010 ) .",
    "the importance of relaxation phenomena for suspensions in turbulent flow is well - known in the context of hydraulic engineering ( yalin & finlaysen 1973 ; van rijn 1986b ; celik & rodi 1988 ; ouillon & le guennec 1996 ) .",
    "this importance has also been recognized in the context of geomorphology ; in particular , lague & davy ( 2009 ) proposed a deposition length of sediment as the relevant transport length .",
    "however , a derivation of a relaxation equation of the form ( [ eq : relax ] ) , from firm hydrodynamic grounds , is still lacking .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss the conditions under which an equation of the form ( [ eq : relax ] ) can be derived for turbulent flows , when suspension is the dominant mode of transport , with particular emphasis on the identification of the saturation length and time scales .",
    "the article is organised as follows . in the next section",
    ", we present the flow models and saturation conditions . in  [ sec : noneqflows ] we perform a mode analysis of the advection - diffusion equation for the particle concentration applied to unsaturated cases , and then identify the saturation length and time scales of the flux .",
    "the relevance of this approach is illustrated in ",
    "[ sec : applic ] by treating few examples : ( i ) the effect on the sediment flux of a change in the river slope ; ( ii ) the change from a fixed to an erodible bed and ( iii ) the deposition of sediments from a source near the free surface .",
    "for the last two situations , the predictions of the model are tested against experimental data from the literature .",
    "we consider the free - surface , turbulent flow of a fluid layer of thickness @xmath3 over an erodible bed .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we restrict the discussion to flows invariant in the spanwise direction , _ i.e. _ two - dimensional , with streamwise coordinate @xmath20 and upwards transverse coordinate @xmath21 .",
    "measurements have shown that the profile of the streamwise velocity is close to the logarithmic law @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the friction velocity , @xmath24 is the hydrodynamical bed roughness , and @xmath25 is the von krmn coefficient . for steady flow where the shear stress is balanced by the streamwise component of gravity , the shear stress increases linearly from zero at the free surface to @xmath26 at the bottom , so that the logarithmic velocity profile ( [ eq : log_ux ] ) corresponds to a parabolic eddy viscosity @xmath27 ( nezu & rodi 1986 ) , given by @xmath28 from ( [ eq : log_ux ] ) , the depth - averaged velocity @xmath4 is given by @xmath29 , \\label{eq : lambda}\\ ] ] with typical value @xmath30 , corresponding to @xmath31 ( raudkivi 1998 ) .",
    "we assume that the sediment concentration @xmath32 is governed by the advection - diffusion equation @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the particle eddy diffusivity and @xmath5 the settling velocity .",
    "measurements have shown that @xmath35 is reasonably parabolic and proportional to the eddy viscosity ( [ eq : nu_t ] ) , with turbulent schmidt number @xmath36 in the range @xmath37@xmath38 ( coleman 1970 ; celik & rodi 1988 ; nielsen 1992 ) .",
    "the settling velocity @xmath5 is taken uniform , and , when needed for comparison with experiments , equal to that of a single particle in quiescent fluid .",
    "note that the above modelling ignores inertial effects on particle motion , in particular their ejection from the core of vortices and their clustering ( bec et al .",
    "2007 ; hunt et al .",
    "we also limit the discussion to dilute suspensions , _",
    "i.e. _ small volumic particle concentration @xmath32 , for which there is no significant feedback of the particles on transport .    solving ( [ eq : concentration ] ) requires two boundary conditions , one at the free surface and one on the sedimentary bed . at the free surface , the net vertical flux vanishes , giving @xmath39 at the bottom , just above the bedload layer where particles mainly roll and slide on each other , the diffusive flux is equal to the erosion flux @xmath40 , _",
    "i.e. _ the volume of particles entrained in suspension per unit time and bed area ( parker 1978 ; van rijn 1986a ) : @xmath41 the erosion rate , or ` pickup function ' , is generically an increasing function of the basal shear stress above a threshold .",
    "its functional form is determined phenomenologically from experiments and depends on the nature of the bed ",
    "e.g. whether it is consolidated / cohesive or not , composed of grains or containing clay , etc .",

    "two remarks have to be made here .",
    "first , the bottom condition ( [ eq : bc@z=0 ] ) applies for steady and homogeneous as well as unsteady or heterogeneous flows . in the latter case",
    ", the erosion flux may be different from the deposition flux , so that the net flux is nonzero , which may lead to variations of the bed topography ( not necessarily , as in the experiments to be discussed later ) .",
    "possible variations in the bed topography will be ignored here .",
    "second remark , the boundary condition ( [ eq : bc@z=0 ] ) corresponds to a bed allowing unlimited sediment supply . for more general situations ( e.g. fixed bed )",
    ", slightly different boundary conditions have been proposed , see celik & rodi ( 1988 ) , which however requires an empirical constant or reference concentration near the bottom to be given , which varies along the channel . finally , assuming that particles have the same mean velocity as the fluid , @xmath42 , the flux of suspended particles , per unit length in the spanwise direction , is given by @xmath43 the concentration equation ( [ eq : concentration ] ) with the boundary condition ( [ eq : bc@z = h ] ) admit a steady and homogeneous solution corresponding to the balance of the settling and diffusive fluxes , @xmath44 where @xmath45 , known as the rouse number , is defined as @xmath46 and the bottom concentration @xmath47 is determined from the condition ( [ eq : bc@z=0 ] ) as @xmath48 note that ( [ eq : phi_rouse ] ) differs slightly for the classical expression of the rouse profile ( nielsen 1992 ) because the location where the velocity ( [ eq : log_ux ] ) vanishes and where the bottom boundary condition ( [ eq : bc@z=0 ] ) applies has been chosen to be @xmath49 instead of @xmath50 .",
    "suspension typically occurs when @xmath51 ( fredse & daigaard 1992 ) , which corresponds to @xmath52 with @xmath53 .",

    "this model corresponds to uniform flow velocity @xmath57 and friction velocity @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the same constant as in the previous section .",
    "such a plug flow model is of course a rough description , and the velocity profile actually does not switch from zero on the bed to its average value on a vanishing vertical distance , leading to an infinite shear .",
    "this problem is not present in the logarithmic model , which is more realistic from this point of view .",
    "however , as shown below , these two models do not differ much as far as the relaxation modes are concerned , which means that what occurs very close to the bed is not very important for the present purpose .",
    "accordingly , a uniform particle diffusivity @xmath60 will be taken in the concentration equation ( [ eq : concentration ] ) and boundary conditions ( [ eq : bc@z = h]-[eq : bc@z=0 ] ) , equal to the average of the parabolic distribution given by ( [ eq : nu_t ] ) and ( [ eq : sc ] ) .",
    "up to a small correction of order @xmath61 , the diffusivity @xmath60 is given by @xmath62 with this uniform diffusivity @xmath60 , the advection - diffusion equation ( [ eq : concentration ] ) admits the steady and homogeneous solution @xmath63 which also satisfies the boundary condition ( [ eq : bc@z = h ] ) at the free surface .",
    "the boundary condition at the bed ( [ eq : bc@z=0 ] ) determines the bed concentration ( [ eq : phi_0 ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : two_models]b displays the concentration profile ( [ eq : phi ] ) , normalized by @xmath55 , for three typical values of @xmath64 .",
    "it can be seen that for the same value of the rouse number , the plug flow model predicts sediment concentration slightly larger than that of the logarithmic flow model .",
    "small values of @xmath65 correspond to strong suspensions , i.e. situations for which the sediment is distributed almost uniformly over the whole depth of the flow .",
    "this is achieved when the settling velocity is small ( very fine particles ) or when the diffusivity is large ( large flow velocity ) .",
    "finally , the saturated particle flux per unit width @xmath17 , normalized by the water flux @xmath66 , is given by @xmath67 for small @xmath65 , this dimensionless flux tends to @xmath55 , as expected .",
    "in this section , we successively consider a spatial evolution problem (  [ sec : lsat ] ) and a temporal evolution problem (  [ sec : tsat ] ) .",
    "these problems are solved using a mode analysis , _",
    "i.e. _ the departure of the concentation field from the saturated distribution @xmath68 is decomposed as a sum of terms of the form @xmath69 .",
    "it is shown that , for the spatial problem , there exists a discrete set of amplitudes @xmath70 , and for the temporal problem , there exists a similar set of amplitudes @xmath71 .",
    "then the sediment flux is shown to be dominated by the mode with the largest length or time , @xmath72 or @xmath73 .",
    "this result demonstrates that for large scale problems , the relaxation equation ( [ eq : relax ] ) retains the most important features of unsaturated sediment transport , with relaxation scales @xmath19 and @xmath18 equal to the largest scales arising from the mode analysis .",
    "the analytical calculations presented below use the plug flow model because of its simplicity , in the spirit of the work of mei ( 1979 ) .",
    "calculations for the logarithmic model are not reported in detail , but the corresponding results are plotted for comparison in some of the figures .",
    "we consider the situation where , for given flow conditions and corresponding saturated concentration profile @xmath68 , the actual concentration profile at some point , say @xmath12 , is @xmath74 where @xmath75 is a ` concentration defect ' .",
    "we search for the distance at which the saturated distribution @xmath68 is recovered , corresponding to vanishing @xmath75 . looking for normal modes of relaxation of the concentration defect of the form @xmath76",
    "we get from the advection - diffusion equation ( [ eq : concentration ] ) @xmath77 at the free surface , the zero flux condition ( [ eq : bc@z = h ] ) gives @xmath78 on the bed the friction velocity @xmath23 is assumed to be uniform . the erosion flux @xmath40 , which depends only on @xmath23 , is uniform too .",
    "hence , the disturbance of @xmath40 is zero , so that , from ( [ eq : bc@z=0 ] ) , @xmath79 the above differential problem is solved numerically for parabolic @xmath34 ( logarithmic flow model ) and analytically for uniform @xmath80 ( plug flow model ) . for uniform @xmath60 , equation ( [ equamodale ] ) has solutions of the form @xmath81 , where @xmath82 has to satisfy a quadratic equation with roots @xmath83 and @xmath84 given by @xmath85 then the boundary conditions ( [ eq : bc2@z = h]-[eq : bc2@z=0 ] ) select a discrete set of relaxation lengths @xmath86 verifying  : @xmath87 this equation has an infinite number of real positive solutions @xmath88 , @xmath89 .",

    "as soon as the flow depth @xmath3 is larger than a few @xmath142 , the  unstable  flat bed is insensitive to the presence of the free surface , and current ripples emerge at a centimetric wavelength ( @xmath144 ) . when suspended load is the dominant type of transport , we have shown that the relaxation length @xmath142 is on the order of @xmath143@xmath145 , which is typically four to five orders of magnitude larger than for bed load . suspended transport thus prevents the formation of bedforms with wavelength smaller than @xmath3 , and patterns such as bars , antidunes and meanders can be expected to emerge from linear instability , with large wavelengths on the order of @xmath146@xmath147 .",
