    "abrikosov vortex lines @xcite were rediscovered by nielsen and olesen in the realm of the abelian higgs model and were proposed as models for dual strings @xcite . in this framework , the interest of studying the quantum nature of these quasi - one - dimensional extended structures was immediately recognized ; contrarily to the macroscopic ginzburg - landau theory of type ii superconductors , the birth - place of magnetic flux tubes , the abelian higgs model is expected to play a r@xmath0le in microscopic physics .",
    "this issue was first addressed in section  .",
    "3 of the original nielsen - olesen paper ; taking the zero thickness limit of the vortex line , the quantization techniques of the old string theory were applied .    in this communication",
    "we shall deal with one - loop mass shifts for the topological solitons that generate the thick string structures .",
    "the mass of the topological solitons of the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional abelian higgs model become the string tension of the flux tubes embedded in three dimensions .",
    "thus , from the ( 3 + 1)-dimensional perspective , semi - classical string tensions will be considered . in particular",
    "we offer as a novelty the derivation of the vortex casimir energy from the canonical quantization of the planar abelian higgs model . with this demonstration",
    ", we shall arrive at the starting point chosen in references @xcite and @xcite to derive a formula for the one - loop vortex mass shifts .",
    "the formula involves the coefficients of the heat - kernel expansion associated with the second - order fluctuation operator and affords us a numerical computation of the mass shifts . before our work ,",
    "only fermionic fluctuations on vortex backgrounds have been accounted for by bordag in @xcite .",
    "the control of the ultra - violet divergences arising in the procedure will be achieved by using heat kernel / zeta function regularization methods . in the absence of detailed knowledge of the spectrum of the differential operator governing second - order fluctuations around vortices",
    ", the expansion of the associated heat kernel will be used in a way akin to that developed in the computation of one - loop mass shifts for one - dimensional kinks , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in fact , a similar technique has been applied before to compute the mass shift for the supersymmetric kink @xcite , although in this latter case the boundary conditions must respect supersymmetry . in the case of vortices ,",
    "the only available results besides the work reported here refer to supersymmetric vortices and were achieved by vassilevich and the stony brook / wien group , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we start by very briefly treating the parallel and simpler development for the kink of the @xmath1-model . with the conventions of @xcite the one - loop kink mass shift formula in the @xmath1 model on a line is formally : @xmath2 .",
    "the two pieces are :    1 .   the kink casimir energy measured with respect to the vacuum casimir energy -zero point energy renormalization- : @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the differential operators governing the second - order fluctuations around the kink and the vacuum respectively .",

    "our minimal subtraction scheme fits with the renormalization prescription set in @xcite : for theories with only massive fluctuations , the quantum corrections should vanish in the limit in which all masses go to infinity .",
