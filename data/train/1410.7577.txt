    "recent experiments @xcite show that a great degree of coherent control is possible between micromechanical oscillators and a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) of magnetically trapped rubidium-87 atoms @xcite .",
    "chip - based magneto traps offer a high degree of control when the bec and a micromechanical cantilever are brought close to distances of the order of the micrometer . at that level of proximity between a cantilever and a bec ,",
    "the surface forces start to play a role .",
    "such forces allow one to couple coherently the collective dynamics of a condensate and a mechanical oscillator .",
    "accordingly , it is possible to study the interaction between trapped atoms and on - chip - solid - state systems such as nano - micro mechanical oscillators @xcite .",
    "one of the major experimental goals is to use neutral atoms to coherently manipulate the state of the oscillator .",
    "there are several proposals aimed at achieving this by employing atoms in a cavity with a moving mirror @xcite , or by coupling atoms by means of a reflective membrane , where the lattice trapping the atoms is built by reflecting a laser beam off the membrane @xcite .",
    "such opto - mechanical systems , composed by nano - mechanical oscillators and atoms interfaced via optical quantum buses , have been recently discussed in the context of quantum non - demolition bell measurements and the ability to prepare epr entangled states @xcite . also ions are proposed as transducers for electromechanical oscillators @xcite while other proposals involve the coupling between oscillators and dipolar molecules @xcite .",
    "a growing interest , both theoretical and experimental , is therefore apparent in the study of nanomechanical oscillators and their interaction with other quantum systems @xcite . in these systems it is possible to achieve different levels of coherent control by incorporating them into combined ( hybrid ) devices , involving single electron transistors @xcite and point contacts ( pcs ) @xcite , microwave cavities in superconducting regime @xcite , or superconducting qubits @xcite .",
    "these numerous experiments and theoretical proposals indicate the feasibility of studying quantum correlations , quantum control of mechanical force sensors and decoherence in the regime where strong coherent coupling is achieved .    in particular , the experimental advances mentioned above will enhance our ability to test fundamental quantum properties , such as decoherence in a well controlled setting @xcite",
    ". the determination of decoherence rates to a high accuracy , and their comparison to theoretical predictions will be possible in a near future .",
    "one particularly interesting goal would be to explore the quantum - to - classical transition @xcite in the dynamics of the mechanical oscillator , and the possibly anomalous decoherence that the oscillator may exhibit when in contact with a bec .",
    "in @xcite it was analysed the dynamics of an oscillator coupled to a bec trapped in a symmetric double well potential , with the atomic current dependent on the oscillator coordinate .",
    "the fact that the bosons tunnel into a single state , rather than into a broad energy zone , as in the case of a point contact , gives the decoherence process unusual properties .",
    "thus , a qubit monitored by a bec undergoes an anomalously slow state - dependent decoherence @xcite , while its decoherence in the presence of a pc is exponential in time .",
    "similarly , a harmonic quantum oscillator whose position is being monitored is capable of retaining some , or even all , of its coherence @xcite .",
    "one of the reasons for such behaviour lies in the fact that a displaced harmonic oscillator maintains its equidistant level structure , and its motion remains periodic even when coupled to a bec via its position .",
    "this may not be true if there is even a small degree of anharmonicity in the oscillator s motion .",
    "the effect of anharmonicity on the decoherence rate of an oscillator coupled to a bec trapped in a double well structure is the subject of this work .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "a brief description of the model is presented in section ii .",
    "a quasiclassical analysis of the system dynamics and its implications in the appearance of decoherence is presented in section iii a. section iii b contains results of a full quantum analysis .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section iv .",
    "we are interested in an anharmonic nanomechanical oscillator coupled to a bec in such a way that its position influences the atomic current flowing between the wells of a double - well potential in which the bec s atoms are trapped .",
    "thus we consider , in one dimension , a quartic anharmonic oscillator of mass @xmath0 and frequency @xmath1 , described by the hamiltonian @xmath2 where @xmath3 controls anharmonicity of the potential .",
    "the oscillator is coupled to a bec composed by non - interacting bosonic atoms trapped in a symmetric double well potential . without tunnelling",
    "the atoms may occupy the left or right well @xmath4 where the operator @xmath5 creates a boson in the ground state of the left ( right ) well .",
    "we choose the coupling to be linear in the the bec s tunnelling operator @xmath6 , and assuming oscillation to be small , linearise it also in the oscillator s position @xmath7 @xmath8 \\,(\\hat c^{\\dagger}_l \\hat",

    "the flow of bosons across the barrier dividing the wells depends on @xmath12 , and may be used to extract information about the oscillator s position . the back action provided by such a measurement on the observed",
    "oscillator is the subject of this paper .",
    "a sketch of a possible experimental setup is shown in fig.1 .",
    "since the trap is symmetric , the tunnelling operator commutes with the @xmath13 , @xmath14=0 $ ]",

    ". it is readily seen that the bec will continue in @xmath19 , while the oscillator would experience a constant energy shift of @xmath20 and an additional force @xmath21 .",
    "moreover , the density matrix of the oscillator at a time @xmath22 , @xmath23 , is given by a weighted sum of density matrices @xmath24 evolved from @xmath25 under different forces @xmath26 @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the probability to find the bec in a state @xmath15 at @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "\\label{eq:5a}\\ ] ] ( we note that the constant energy shifts cancel , and do not contribute to the oscillators evolution ) .",
    "similarly , for the expectation value of an oscillator s observable @xmath32 , we have @xmath33= \\sum_n p(n ) { \\rm tr}_{\\rm osc}\\left[{\\hat{\\rho}_{\\hbox{\\scriptsize { osc}}}}(0 ) \\hat",

    "we can consider a limit in which the number of bosons in the bec increases , while the individual tunnelling probability is reduced , so that there is a finite atomic current between the two wells , @xmath35 preparing all the atoms in the left well , @xmath36 we have a source of practically irreversible current , since the rabi period after which the bec returns to its initial state is now very large @xcite . measuring after a time @xmath22 the number of atoms in the right",
    "well gives information about the oscillator s past @xcite .",
    "also the sums in eqs.([eq:5 ] ) and ( [ eq:6 ] ) can be replaced by integrals , @xmath37 .",
    "continuous distribution of forces corresponding to the initial state ( [ left ] ) is gaussian , @xmath38 with @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the process of decoherence appears in general in the dynamics of averages of particular observables .",
    "then , instead of analysing the density matrix ( [ eq:5 ] ) , it is convenient to consider the oscillator s mean position , thus choosing the operator @xmath32 in eq.([eq:6 ] ) as the operator @xmath12 , @xmath40 which reads , in the continuous limit ,    @xmath41    with @xmath42 .",
    "indeed , it can be observed that in the case @xmath43 , the exponentials in the second term of eq.([equis ] ) are rapidly - oscillating functions and consequently such term will vanish",
    ". therefore @xmath44 [ and with it the averages ( [ eq:6 ] ) ] will tend to stationary values as @xmath45 .",
    "without such a cancellation , the oscillator will not be able to reach a steady state no matter how long one waits .",
    "equation ( [ equis ] ) is the starting point of the quantum calculations we shall present .",
    "we shall first look at the time evolution of a state of the oscillator in wigner representation when it is influenced by the condensate . in that representation ,",
    "the state develops structure as time progresses .",
    "an initial state of the oscillator evolves according to a schrdinger equation that takes into account the effect of the condensate . in one dimension",
    "the wigner function associated to a quantum state @xmath46 is defined as @xcite @xmath47 it is convenient to write a state @xmath46 of the oscillator for a given time @xmath22 in terms of the eigenstates @xmath48 of the harmonic oscillator as @xmath49 by inserting this expression in ( [ wignerfunction ] ) it follows the wigner function corresponding to the state of the oscillator as @xmath50 where @xmath51 the integral in this expression has a representation in terms of generalized laguerre polynomials @xmath52 yielding @xmath53 with @xmath54 . when equation ( [ wnm ] ) is combined with equation ( [ wignerosc ] ) it follows an analytical expression for the wigner function of the oscillator . in figure [ quantumdecay ]",
    "it is plotted the wigner function of the oscillator at different times .",
    "it can be seen that as time proceeds an initial coherent state starts to spread over phase space developing a highly oscillatory structure , that at the end is responsible for the decay of the position expectation value .",
    "it is precisely the study of such decay and of its details the subject of this work .",
    "we begin by evaluating the quasi classical limit of ( [ equis ] ) which is conveniently obtained by employing the weyl - wigner representation @xcite . for the average of an arbitrary operator describing the oscillator , @xmath55 , we write @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the weyl - wigner transforms of the initial oscillator s state , and of the operator @xmath55 in its heisenberg representation , @xmath59 the dynamical aspects of the formalism are contained in the equation of motion for @xmath60 @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the wigner representation of the quantum hamiltonian operator @xmath63 , and the moyal ( sine ) bracket",

    "equations ( [ 1 ] ) - ( [ 3 ] ) are a convenient starting point for our quasi classical analysis .",
    "expanding @xmath66 in powers of @xmath67 , as @xmath68 and recalling that as @xmath69 the moyal bracket reduces to the classical poisson bracket @xmath70 @xcite , we obtain an approximate equation of motion for @xmath71 , @xmath72 with the initial condition @xmath73 which is obtained by evaluating the integral ( [ 2 ] ) for @xmath30 .",

    "we identify @xmath80 with @xmath81 , so that @xmath82 .",
    "thus , @xmath71 is just the position , at a time @xmath22 , of the oscillator whose initial position and momentum at @xmath30 were @xmath81 and @xmath83 , respectively ,    it is readily seen that in the quasi classical limit , the task of calculating the mean oscillator s position at time @xmath22 , @xmath84 , \\label{quasiclass}\\ ] ] reduces to choosing initial phase space distribution @xmath57 , which contains all quantum effects , and evaluating classical oscillator trajectories for different values of the induced force @xmath26 . in the limit of small anharmonicity ( @xmath85 ) the system will be shown to behave as a set of harmonic oscillators each one with a slightly shifted frequency and the semiclassical approximation described by the previous equation is very accurate for the purpose of studying the decoherence effect induced by the coupling with the bec system . to support",
    "the accuracy of the approximations made comparisons with the results obtained by exact numerical integration of the schrdinger equation are provided .",
    "the numerics give strong support to the semiclassical approximation in the limit we are considering .      next we specify our analysis to the case where the oscillator is prepared in a coherent state , whose weyl - wigner transform is given by @xmath86 there are no analytical solutions for a classical anharmonic oscillator",
    ". however , the decoherence effects absent for a harmonic oscillator , appear already in the limit of small anharmonicity ( @xmath87 ) . in this case approximate oscillator trajectories can be obtained , e.g. , by the method of strained coordinates ( lindsted - poincar method ) for periodic solutions @xcite , which we will describe here briefly .",
    "we begin by considering a trajectory such that at some @xmath88 it passes through some @xmath89 with a zero momentum , @xmath90 , @xmath91 .",
    "this can be represented by a sum of harmonic functions with phases and amplitudes modified at different orders in @xmath3 .",

    "explicitly , we have @xmath97 which describes a harmonic motion whose frequency is modified both by the anharmonicity of the oscillator potential and the presence of the bec , and also depends on the initial position @xmath81 and momentum @xmath83 of the oscilllator , @xmath98.\\ ] ] higher order corrections in @xmath3 can be systematically obtained if necessary , although decoherence for small enough @xmath3 ( @xmath87 ) is accurately described at this level of approximation . in particular a third harmonic contribution , with an amplitude which is first order in @xmath3 , is negligible as compared to the decoherence / dephasing effect we will show next to be produced by the combined effect of frequency shift in the first harmonic ( which is also first order in @xmath3 ) and the interaction with the bec , which implies a superposition of signals with frequencies @xmath99 $ ] that contain terms @xmath100 and @xmath101 , which is at the end the origin of the decoherence effect we illustrate in this work ( see the details in the appendix ) .    replacing in eq.([quasiclass ] ) the summation over discrete levels of the bec by integration as described in sect .",

    "the agreement between both results is good , and we proceed to use the quasi classical eq.([result ] ) in order to characterise the decoherence in the short and the long time limits .",
    "if the oscillator is not coupled to the condensate then it will show a coherent motion in which coherences will remain in time leading to recurrences in the oscillator dynamics .",
    "the action of the condensate quenches such recurrences .",
    "we shall assume that the coupling between the condensate and the oscillator is such that recurrences in the dynamics of the oscillator have been suppressed and therefore the decoherence process occurs in a time scale much shorter than the dynamical recurrence time of the free ( uncoupled ) oscillator .",
    "there are two relevant processes with regard to the time development and decay of @xmath121 : the non - linearity in the potential , and the interaction with the condensate .",
    "as already emphasized , when such non - linearity does not exists the coupling between the oscillator and the condensate will not lead to a decay in oscillator s expectation values , even if variances and higher order fluctuations are affected by such coupling @xcite .",
    "however , the non - linear potential together with the oscillator - condensate interaction induces decoherence .",
    "a natural time scale linked to such non - linearity can be defined as @xmath122 .",
    "in addition , the interaction between the oscillator and the condensate introduces a different time scale , given by @xmath123 .",
    "both time scales are different and they are useful to understand the time development of oscillator s observables .",
    "we shall analyze the dynamics in two different situations , for @xmath22 either smaller or larger than both characteristic time scales .      in this case the solution is accurately represented by @xmath125,\\ ] ] with @xmath126 , and @xmath127 it is apparent that @xmath128 is a natural time scale associated with a gaussian decoherence process taking place for times smaller than @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "furthermore , a fully gaussian decay , including a gaussian tail , will develop if @xmath131 , @xmath130 .",
    "that situation will appear in a fully semiclassical regime .",
    "in the quantum domain @xmath128 will be of the order of or smaller than @xmath130 leading to a decay which will not be gaussian . in the limit of harmonic potential a coherent motion as reported in @xcite is recovered , emphasizing the relevance of the non - linearity to the decoherence process .      in this case",
    "the solution can be represented by using a long time approximation by @xmath133 the agreement of this expression with the numerical exact solutions to the quantum equations has been checked for small @xmath3 ( @xmath87 ) . we observe that if time is much larger than @xmath129 and @xmath130 the decay is algebraic . notably the amplitude is exponentially damped as @xmath134 , therefore this suggests that deeply within the quasiclassical regime , in consistency with the results of the previous section , it would be difficult to observe such power law decay , indicating that such dynamics would be observable mainly within the quantum domain .",
    "the decay of observables shows an initial gaussian decay for short times and a power law decay for longer times .",
    "our results are consistent with those in @xcite where gaussian decoherence was studied .    in the next section we present numerical simulations as well as some analytical approximate expressions describing the dynamics of the system in the full quantum regime .",
    "for the quantum case and an arbitrary value of @xmath3 there are no analytical solutions .",
    "numerical solutions can be obtained efficiently by diagonalizing @xmath135 over a truncated basis of stationary states of the harmonic oscillator centered at the origin , for each value of @xmath103 .",
    "convergence with respect to the number of basis states used for the truncated diagonalization is checked for each particular value of @xmath3 and for the initial state of the oscillator .",
    "these numerical results are used all throughout the paper to compare with the different analytical approximations described .    in the general case , for arbitrary values of @xmath3 , many different time - dependent terms will contribute to the sum in ( [ equis ] ) .",
    "however , in some limiting cases and under some approximations , analytical expressions can be obtained that describe the time decay with accuracy .",
    "we will consider here as an illustration the case of an initial state of the oscillator involving only a few lower - energy states of the oscillator with frequency @xmath1 and a value of @xmath136 .",
    "let us focus on the time - dependent part of eq.([equis ] ) , @xmath137 where the superscript `` st '' stands for stationary and with @xmath138 .",
    "firstly , for not too large values of @xmath139 , it is enough to write the energy eigenvalues as a second order expansion in @xmath103 , @xmath140 , ( the term linear in @xmath103 is zero because the anharmonicity is even in the @xmath141coordinate ) . a first order approximation in @xmath3 for @xmath142 and @xmath143",
