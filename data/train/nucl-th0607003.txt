    "at present , qcd can not describe quantitatively the low - energy nucleon - antinucleon interaction , and various phenomenological approaches have been suggested in order to explain numerous experimental data , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite and recent reviews @xcite .",
    "however , parameters of the models still can not be extracted with a good accuracy from the experimental data @xcite .",
    "very recently , renewed interest in low - energy nucleon - antinucleon physics has been stimulated by the experimental observation of a strong enhancement of decay probability at low invariant mass of @xmath3 in the processes @xmath4 @xcite , @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xcite , @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xcite , @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "one of the most natural explanation of this enhancement is final state interaction of the proton and antiproton @xcite .",
    "a similar phenomenon was observed in the investigation of the proton ( antiproton ) electric , @xmath10 , and magnetic , @xmath11 , form factors in the process @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "namely , it was found that the ratio @xmath13 strongly depends on @xmath14 ( in the center - of - mass frame ) in the narrow region of the energy @xmath15 near the threshold of @xmath3 production .",
    "such strong dependence at small @xmath16 is related to the interaction of proton and antiproton at large distances @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , it is possible to take one of the nucleon - antinucleon interactions determined in @xcite for describing the final state interaction in the process @xmath0 in order to explain the experimental data . in the present paper , we use the paris nucleon - antinucleon optical potential @xmath18 which has the form @xcite : @xmath19 where the real part @xmath20 is the @xmath21-parity transform of the well established paris @xmath22 potential for the long- and medium - ranged distances ( @xmath23 ) , and some phenomenological part for the short distances .",
    "the absorptive part @xmath24 of the optical potential takes into account the inelastic channels of @xmath25 interaction , i.e. annihilation into mesons .",
    "it is essential at short distances and depends on the kinetic energy of the particles .",
    "our knowledge of @xmath24 is essentially more restricted than that of @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , we hope that experimental data for the cross section of the process @xmath26 can significantly diminish the uncertainty in @xmath24 .",
    "using the standard definition of the dirac form factors @xmath27 and @xmath28 @xcite of the proton we write , in the nonrelativistic approximation , the amplitude of @xmath29 pair production near threshold as follows ( in units @xmath30 ) : @xmath31 { \\bf e}_\\mu   \\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{ef_2(q^2)-mf_1(q^2)}{3m(e+m)}\\bigl[3({\\bf p}'\\cdot{\\bf e}_\\mu){\\bf p}'-{\\bf p}'^2{\\bf e}_\\mu\\bigr]\\biggr\\}\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is a virtual photon polarization vector , and @xmath33 is the spin-1 function of @xmath29 pair .",
    "two tensor structures in eq.([2 ] ) correspond to the s - wave and d - wave production amplitudes .",
    "the total angular momentum of the @xmath29 pair is fixed by a production mechanism .",
    "the functions @xmath27 and @xmath28 are related in a standard way with the electric and the magnetic form factors of the proton @xmath34 and @xmath35 . near threshold",
    ", it is more convenient to work with the dirac form factors , because at threshold @xmath36 .",
    "the amplitude ( [ 2 ] ) already includes effects of final state interaction .",
    "therefore , the form factors in eq.([2 ] ) should have a pronounced @xmath37 behavior near threshold .",
    "our aim is to single out these effects . in order to do that ,",
    "let us introduce the amplitude @xmath38 which has the form of eq.([2 ] ) but with the replacement @xmath39 and @xmath40 , where the form factors @xmath41 do not account for the effect of final state interaction .",
    "so , the difference between @xmath42 and @xmath38 is in their @xmath37 dependence due to the form factors . in @xmath38 ,",
    "the only scale is the nucleon mass @xmath43 ( which is still too small to use perturbative qcd ) .",
    "therefore , near threshold , where the final state interaction is important , the form factors @xmath41 are smooth functions of @xmath37 and can be treated as phenomenological constants .",
    "now we can construct the amplitude of @xmath29 pair production in a certain isospin channel @xmath44 using the wave function @xmath45 of the @xmath29 pair in momentum space : @xmath46 { \\bf e}_\\mu \\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{e\\tilde{f}^i_2-m\\tilde{f}^i_1}{3m(e+m)}\\bigl[3({\\bf p}'\\cdot { \\bf e}_\\mu){\\bf p } ' -{\\bf p}'^2{\\bf e}_\\mu\\bigr]\\biggr\\}\\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the fourier transform of the function @xmath47 , which is the wave function @xmath48 of the @xmath29 pair in coordinate space , is the solution of the schrdinger equation @xmath49 where @xmath50 is given by eq.([vnn ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath48 is the left eigenfunction of the bi - orthogonal set of eigenfunctions of the non - hermitian operator @xmath51 .",
    "its asymptotic behavior at large distances is @xmath52 for @xmath2 production , we have @xmath53 , while for @xmath54 .      in the presence of tensor forces ,",
    "the states with angular momentum @xmath55 and @xmath56 are coupled , while the total angular momentum @xmath57 is conserved . as a result",
    ", the final - state wave function @xmath58 can be represented in the form @xmath59 where @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are three independent solutions of the schrdinger equation having total angular momentum @xmath57 . in eqs.([7 ] ) and ( [ 8 ] ) , @xmath63 is the vector spherical harmonic , which is an eigenfunction of the operators @xmath64 , and @xmath65 , where @xmath66 and @xmath67 . in order to find the coefficients @xmath68 and @xmath69 in eq .",

    "we omitted here effects of coulomb - nuclear interference . using the form factors @xmath96 as free parameters , we fit the observed energy behavior of the cross section up to 100 mev of proton kinetic energy .",
    "we found that using the original paris @xmath29 potential @xcite it is impossible to reproduce the energy behavior of the cross section .",
    "the cross section falls down too steeply becoming more than one order of magnitude smaller than the observed one at 10 mev of proton c.m . kinetic energy .",
    "we verified that possible smooth dependence of the form factors @xmath96 on q in a narrow energy region near threshold ( for instance , @xmath97 with @xmath98 ) , which is not related to final state interaction , does not change this result .",
    "the result is also insensitive to variation of most parameters of the potential .",
    "variation of the energy independent parameters is absorbed by the fitting parameters @xmath96 .",
    "however , if we modify the only parameter , the energy dependence of absorptive part of the triplet potential @xmath99 , decreasing it by a factor of @xmath100 , we obtain a good fit of the cross section ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "modification of the energy dependence of the real part of the potential is not so important .",
    "note that the values of the parameters , which are responsible for the energy dependence of the potential , are not well known .",
    "in the two versions of the paris @xmath29 potential , @xcite and @xcite , these parameters differ from each other up to factor 2 . in order to clarify the importance of the energy dependence of the absorptive potential",
    ", we calculated s - matrix elements and corresponding phase shifts for @xmath101 , @xmath67 at different energies .",
    "it turns out that the phase shifts obtained with our strong modification of the absorptive potential differ only slightly as compared to those obtained in @xcite .",
    "the only noticeable modification appeared in the energy dependence of the parameter @xmath102 directly related to absorption .",
    "in contrast , @xmath103 , see eq.([7 ] ) , is much more sensitive to this modification .",
    "therefore , the uncertainty in determination of the parameters of energy dependence in the absorptive part of the triplet potential from the scattering data is apparently larger than factor two , and it is necessary to use also another data . in the process",
    "@xmath104 we have a unique situation where the quantum numbers of @xmath2 pair are fixed , @xmath105 .",
    "however , the absorptive part of @xmath29 effective potential is not universal and may be different in different scattering channels , as it takes place in nijmengen potential @xcite .",
    "thus , the modification of the energy dependence in the absorptive part of the potential for @xmath105 channel does not allow us to make any conclusions on other channels and a new fit of absorptive potential in these channels should be performed .    using the parameters obtained from the fit of the cross section , we simultaneously reproduce the energy behavior of the form factors ratio @xmath106 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . emphasize that the form factor @xmath107 differs from the form factor @xmath108 due to the contribution of d - wave only , see eq.([17 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the strong energy dependence of the ratio @xmath106 clearly indicates the importance of d - wave even in the vicinity of threshold .",
    "having obtained the amplitudes for the two isospins , we have calculated the cross section and the ratio @xmath106 for the process @xmath109 .",
    "the corresponding results are shown in figs 1,2 by the dashed lines .",
    "it is seen that the final state interaction leads to strong enhancement of both quantities in @xmath1 channel as well .",
    "it is interesting that the cross section in @xmath1 is larger than that in @xmath2 channel , and their ratio is almost energy independent up to 2.2 gev .",
    "very recently , the final state interaction in @xmath104 has been discussed in ref .",
    "the authors of the paper have presented many arguments in favor of importance of final state interaction in @xmath2 production near threshold .",
    "using jlich model for @xmath29 interaction they have calculated the contribution of @xmath110 partial wave to the @xmath104 cross section near threshold . however , since they have neglected the @xmath111 partial wave contribution , they have not been able to reproduce the ratio @xmath106 which is equal to unity in their approximation .      +    in summary , we calculated the effects of final state interaction in the reactions @xmath104 and @xmath109 near threshold .",
    "we found that the last version of the paris @xmath29 potential @xcite does not reproduce the energy dependence of the observed cross section .",
    "a smooth dependence of the form factors @xmath96 on q in a narrow energy region near threshold , which is not related to final state interaction , does not change this result .",
    "variation of the parameters responsible for the energy dependence of the imaginary part of the potential in the channel with @xmath105 , and @xmath112 allows us to reproduce both the energy dependence of the cross section an the ratio @xmath106 for @xmath2 production .",
