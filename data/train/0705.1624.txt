    "new physics ( np ) can be searched for in two ways : either by raising the available energy at colliders to produce new particles and reveal them directly , or by increasing the experimental precision on certain processes involving standard model ( sm ) particles as external states .",
    "the latter option , indirect search for np , should be pursued using processes that are forbidden , very rare or precisely calculable in the sm . in this respect ,",
    "flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) and cp - violating processes are among the most powerful probes of np , since in the sm they can not arise at the tree - level and even at the loop level they are strongly suppressed by the gim mechanism . furthermore , in the quark sector they are all calculable in terms of the ckm matrix , and in particular of the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 in the generalized wolfenstein parametrization  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , in many cases a deep understanding of hadronic dynamics is required in order to be able to extract the relevant short - distance information from measured processes .",
    "lattice qcd allows us to compute the necessary hadronic parameters in many processes , for example in @xmath4 amplitudes .",
    "indeed , the unitarity triangle analysis ( uta ) with lattice qcd input is extremely successful in determining @xmath2 and @xmath5 and in constraining np contributions to @xmath4 amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "once the ckm matrix is precisely determined by means of the uta ( either within the sm or allowing for generic np in @xmath4 processes ) , it is possible to search for np contributions to @xmath6 transitions .",
    "fcnc and cp - violating hadronic decays are indeed the most sensitive probes of np contributions to penguin operators .",
    "in particular , penguin - dominated nonleptonic @xmath7 decays can reveal the presence of np in decay amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "the dominance of penguin operators is realized in @xmath8 transitions .",
    "thanks to the efforts of the babar and belle collaborations , @xmath7-factories have been able to measure cp violation in several @xmath9 penguin - dominated channels with an impressive accuracy  @xcite . to fully exploit this rich experimental information to test the sm and look for np",
    ", we need to determine the sm predictions for each channel . as we shall see in the following , computing the uncertainty in the sm predictions is an extremely delicate task . only in very few cases it is possible to control this uncertainty using only experimental data",
    "; in general , one has to use some dynamical information , either from flavor symmetries or from factorization . computing cp violation in @xmath10 penguins beyond the sm is even harder : additional operators arise , and in many cases the dominant contribution is expected to come from new operators or from operators that are subdominant in the sm . in the near future , say before the start of the lhc , we can aim at establishing possible hints of np in @xmath0 penguins . with the advent of the lhc , two scenarios are possible .",
    "if new particles are revealed , @xmath0 penguin decays will help us identify the flavor structure of the underlying np model .",
    "if no new particles are seen , @xmath10 penguins can either indirectly reveal the presence of np , if the present hints are confirmed , or allow us to push further the lower bound on the scale of np . in all cases ,",
    "experimental and theoretical progress in @xmath0 hadronic penguins is crucial for our understanding of flavor physics beyond the sm .",
    "this review is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : basic ] we quickly review the basic formalism for @xmath0 nonleptonic decays , and the different approaches to the calculation of decay amplitudes present in the literature . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sm ] , we present the predictions for branching ratios ( br s ) and cp violation within the sm following the various approaches , and compare them with the experimental data . in sec .  [",
    "sec : np ] , we discuss the possible sources of np contributions to @xmath0 penguins and how these np contributions are constrained by experimental data on other @xmath0 transitions . in sec .",
    "[ sec : susy ] , we concentrate on susy extensions of the sm , discuss the present constraints and present detailed predictions for cp violation in @xmath0 penguins . in sec .  [",
    "sec : non - susy ] we briefly discuss @xmath0 penguins in the context of non - susy extensions of the sm . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] we summarize the present status and discuss future prospects .",
    "the basic theoretical framework for non - leptonic @xmath7 decays is based on the operator product expansion ( ope ) and renormalization group methods which allow to write the amplitude for a decay of a given meson @xmath7=@xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 into a final state @xmath14 generally as follows : @xmath15 here @xmath16 is the effective weak hamiltonian , with @xmath17 denoting the relevant local operators which govern the decays in question within the sm , and @xmath18 denoting the ones possibly arising beyond the sm .",
    "the ckm factors @xmath19 and the wilson coefficients @xmath20 describe the strength with which a given operator enters the hamiltonian ; for np contributions , we denote with @xmath21 and @xmath22 the wilson coefficients arising within a given np model , which can in general be complex . in a more intuitive language , the operators @xmath23 can be regarded as effective vertices and the coefficients @xmath20 as the corresponding effective couplings .",
    "the latter can be calculated in renormalization - group improved perturbation theory and are known including next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd corrections within the sm and in a few susy models @xcite .",
    "the scale @xmath24 separates the contributions to @xmath25 into short - distance contributions with energy scales higher than @xmath24 contained in @xmath20 and long - distance contributions with energy scales lower than @xmath24 contained in the hadronic matrix elements @xmath26 .",
    "the scale @xmath24 is usually chosen to be @xmath27 but is otherwise arbitrary .",
    "the effective weak hamiltonian for non - leptonic @xmath0 decays within the sm is given by : @xmath28 \\nonumber   \\\\ & & -v_{tb } v^*_{ts } \\ , \\biggl[c_1(\\mu )",
    "q_1^{c}(\\mu ) +   c_2(\\mu ) q_2^{c}(\\mu ) + \\sum_{i=3,12 } c_i(\\mu ) q_i(\\mu ) \\biggr ] \\biggr\\}\\ , , \\protect\\label{eq : eh } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 denotes the quark electric charge ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 , etc . ) .",
    "the sum over the quarks @xmath35 runs over the active flavors at the scale @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath36 and @xmath37 are the so - called current - current operators , @xmath38 the qcd - penguin operators , @xmath39 the electroweak penguin operators and @xmath40 the ( chromo)-magnetic penguin operators .",
    "@xmath20 are the wilson coefficients evaluated at @xmath41 .",
    "they depend generally on the renormalization scheme for the operators .",
    "the scale and scheme dependence of the coefficients is canceled by the analogous dependence in the matrix elements .",
    "it is therefore convenient to identify the basic renormalization group invariant parameters ( rgi s ) and to express the decay amplitudes in terms of rgi s .",
    "this exercise was performed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the rgi s were identified and the decay amplitudes for several two - body nonleptonic @xmath7 decays were written down . for our purpose",
    ", we just need to recall a few basic facts about the classification of rgi s .",
    "first of all , we have six non - penguin parameters , containing only non - penguin contractions of the current - current operators @xmath42 : emission parameters @xmath43 , annihilation parameters @xmath44 and zweig - suppressed emission - annihilation parameters @xmath45 . then , we have four parameters containing only penguin contractions of the current - current operators @xmath42 in the gim - suppressed combination @xmath46 : @xmath47 and zweig suppressed @xmath48 . finally , we have four parameters containing penguin contractions of current - current operators @xmath49 ( the so - called charming penguins @xcite ) and all possible contractions of penguin operators @xmath50 : @xmath51 and the zweig - suppressed @xmath52 .",
    "let us now discuss some important aspects of @xmath0 penguin nonleptonic decays .",
    "first of all , we define as pure penguin channels the ones that are generated only by @xmath53 and @xmath54 parameters .",
    "pure penguin @xmath0 decays can be written schematically as : @xmath55 neglecting doubly cabibbo suppressed terms , the decay amplitude has vanishing weak phase .",
    "therefore , there is no direct cp violation and the coefficient @xmath56 of the @xmath57 term in the time - dependent cp asymmetry ( for @xmath14 a cp eigenstate with eigenvalue @xmath58 ) measures the phase of the mixing amplitude : @xmath59 , where @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 @xmath64 for @xmath11 @xmath65 mixing . comparing the measured @xmath56 to the one obtained from @xmath66 transitions such as @xmath67",
    "can reveal the presence of np in the @xmath0 penguin amplitude .",
    "however , to perform a precise test of the sm we need to take into account also the doubly cabibbo suppressed terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : purepenguins ] ) .",
    "the second term then acquires a small and calculable weak phase , leading to a small and calculable @xmath68 .",
    "furthermore , we must consider the contribution from the first term , _",
    "i.e. _ the contribution of gim penguins .",
    "an estimate of the latter requires some knowledge of penguin - type hadronic matrix elements , which can be obtained either from theory or from experimental data .",
    "let us define this as the `` gim - penguin problem '' : we shall come back to it in the next section after introducing the necessary theoretical ingredients .",
    "besides pure penguins , we have @xmath0 transitions in which emission , annihilation or emission - annihilation parameters give a contribution to the decay amplitude .",
    "let us call these channels penguin - dominated .",
    "then we can write schematically the decay amplitude as : @xmath69 where @xmath70 . also in this case , neglecting",
    "doubly cabibbo suppressed terms the decay amplitude has vanishing weak phase , so that @xmath71 at this order .",
    "however , we expect @xmath72 so that the double cabibbo suppression can be overcome by the enhancement in the matrix element , leading to a sizable @xmath73 .",
    "once again , the evaluation of @xmath73 requires some knowledge of hadronic dynamics .",
    "let us define this as the `` tree problem '' and return to it in the next section .",
    "the last decade has witnessed remarkable progress in the theory of nonleptonic @xmath7 decays .",
    "bjorken s color transparency argument has been put on firm grounds , and there is now a wide consensus that many @xmath7 two - body decay amplitudes factorize in the limit @xmath74 and are therefore computable in this limit in terms of few fundamental nonperturbative quantities .",
    "three different approaches to factorization in @xmath7 decays have been put forward : the so - called qcd factorization @xcite , perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) @xcite and soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) @xcite .",
    "a detailed discussion of these approaches goes beyond the scope of this review ; for our purpose , it suffices to quickly describe a few aspects that are relevant for the study of @xmath0 penguin nonleptonic decays .    unfortunately , as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite and later confirmed in refs .",
    "@xcite , it turns out that subleading corrections to the infinite mass limit , being doubly cabibbo - enhanced in @xmath0 penguins , are very important ( if not dominant ) in these channels , so that they reintroduce the strong model dependence that we hoped to eliminate using factorization theorems . while different approaches to factorization point to different sources of large corrections , no approach is able to compute from first principles all the ingredients needed to test the sm in @xmath0 penguins . therefore , it is important to pursue , in addition to factorization studies , alternative data - driven approaches that can in some cases lead to model - independent predictions for cp violation in @xmath0 penguins .",
    "let us now quickly review the main tools that are available for the study of @xmath0 penguins .",
    "the first step towards a factorization theorem was given by bjorken s color transparency argument @xcite .",
    "let us consider a decay of the @xmath7 meson in two light pseudoscalars , where two light quarks are emitted from the weak interaction vertex as a fast - traveling small - size color - singlet object . in the heavy - quark limit",
    ", soft gluons can not resolve this color dipole and therefore soft gluon exchange between the two light mesons decouples at lowest order in @xmath75 ( here and in the following @xmath76 denotes a typical hadronic scale of order @xmath77 ) .",
    "assuming that in @xmath7 decays to two light pseudoscalars perturbative sudakov suppression is not sufficient to guarantee the dominance of hard spectator interactions , qcd factorization ( qcdf ) states that all soft spectator interactions can be absorbed in the heavy - to - light form factor @xcite .",
    "considering for example @xmath78 decays , the following factorization formula holds at lowest order in @xmath75 : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is a @xmath81 form factor , and @xmath82 @xmath83 are leading - twist light cone distribution amplitudes of the pion ( @xmath7 meson ) . @xmath84",
    "denote the hard scattering amplitudes .",
    "notice that @xmath85 starts at zeroth order in @xmath86 and at higher order contains hard gluon exchange not involving the spectator , while @xmath87 contains the hard interactions of the spectator and starts at order @xmath86 .",
    "the scheme and scale dependence of the scattering kernels @xmath84 matches the one of wilson coefficients , and the final result is consistently scale and scheme independent .",
    "final state interaction phases appear in this formalism as imaginary parts of the scattering kernels ( at lowest order in @xmath75 ) .",
    "these phases appear in the computation of penguin contractions and of hard gluon exchange between the two pions .",
    "this means that in the heavy quark limit final state interactions can be determined perturbatively .",
    "a few remarks are important for the discussion of cp violation in @xmath10 penguins :    * penguin contractions ( including charming and gim penguins ) are found to be factorizable , at least at one loop .",
    "* subleading terms in the @xmath75 expansion are in general non - factorizable , so that they can not be computed from first principles .",
    "they are important for phenomenology whenever they are chirally or cabibbo enhanced .",
    "in particular , they can not be neglected in @xmath0 penguin modes .",
    "this introduces a strong model dependence in the evaluation of @xmath0 penguin br s and cp asymmetries .",
    "* power suppressed terms can invalidate the perturbative calculation of strong phases performed in the infinite mass limit .",
    "indeed , in this case subleading terms in the @xmath75 expansion can dominate over the loop - suppressed perturbative phases arising at leading order in @xmath75 .",
    "the basic idea underlying pqcd calculations is that the dominant process is hard gluon exchange involving the spectator quark .",
    "pqcd adopts the three - scale factorization theorem @xcite based on the perturbative qcd formalism by brodsky and lepage @xcite , with the inclusion of the transverse momentum carried by partons inside the meson .",
    "the three different scales are the electroweak scale @xmath88 , the scale of hard gluon exchange @xmath89 , and the factorization scale @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the conjugate variable of parton transverse momenta .",
    "the nonperturbative physics at scales below @xmath90 is encoded in process - independent meson wave functions .",
    "the inclusion of transverse momentum leads to a sudakov form factor which suppresses the long distance contributions in the large @xmath91 region , and vanishes as @xmath92 .",
    "this suppression renders the transverse momentum flowing into the hard amplitudes of order @xmath93 .",
    "the off - shellness of internal particles then remains of @xmath94 even in the end - point region , and the singularities are removed .",
    "notice that :    * contrary to qcd factorization , in pqcd all contributions are assumed to be calculable in perturbation theory due to the sudakov suppression .",
    "this item remains controversial ( see refs .  @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "* the dominant strong phases in this approach come from factorized annihilation diagrams . *",
    "also in this case , there is no control over subleading contributions in the @xmath75 expansion .",
    "soft - collinear effective theory is a powerful tool to study factorization in multi - scale problems .",
    "the idea is to perform a two - step matching procedure at the hard ( @xmath95 ) and hard - collinear ( @xmath96 ) scales .",
    "the final expression is given in terms of perturbative hard kernels , light - cone wave functions and jet functions .",
    "for phenomenology , it is convenient to fit directly the nonperturbative parameters on data using the following expression for the decay amplitude , valid at leading order in @xmath86  @xcite : @xmath97 where @xmath98 s are perturbative hard kernels , @xmath99 s are nonperturbative parameters and @xmath100 denotes the `` charming penguin '' contribution .",
    "we notice that :    * charming penguins are not factorized in the infinite mass limit in this approach , contrary to what obtained in qcd factorization ; * phenomenological analyses are carried out at leading order in @xmath86 and at leading power in @xmath75 ; * no control is possible on power corrections to factorization .",
    "an alternative approach that has been pursued extensively in the literature is to use @xmath101 flavor symmetry to extract hadronic matrix elements from experimental data and then use them to predict @xmath101-related channels  @xcite . in principle , in this way it is possible to eliminate all the uncertainties connected to factorization and the infinite mass limit . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath101-breaking must be evaluated to obtain reliable predictions .",
    "a few comments are in order :    * in some fortunate cases , such as the contribution of electroweak penguins @xmath102 to @xmath103 decays , @xmath101 predicts some matrix elements to vanish , so that they can be assumed to be suppressed even in the presence of @xmath101 breaking  @xcite . * explicit nonperturbative calculations of two - body nonleptonic @xmath7",
    "decays indicate that @xmath101-breaking corrections to @xmath7 decay amplitudes can be up to @xmath104 , thus invalidating @xmath101 analyses of these processes  @xcite . * to take partially into account the effects of @xmath101 breaking , several authors assume that symmetry breaking follows the pattern of factorized matrix elements .",
    "while this is certainly an interesting idea , its validity for @xmath0 penguins is questionable , given the importance of nonfactorizable contributions in these channels .",
    "the idea developed in refs .",
    "@xcite is to write down the rgi parameters as the sum of their expression in the infinite mass limit , for example using qcd factorization , plus an arbitrary contribution corresponding to subleading terms in the power expansion .",
    "these additional contributions are then determined by a fit to the experimental data . in @xmath0 penguins ,",
    "the dominant power - suppressed correction is given by charming penguins , and the corresponding parameter can be determined with high precision from data and is found to be compatible with a @xmath75 correction to factorization @xcite .",
    "however , non - dominant corrections , for example gim penguin parameters in @xmath0 decays , can be extracted from data only in a few cases ( for example in @xmath103 decays ) @xcite .",
    "however , predictions for @xmath73 depend crucially on these corrections , so that one needs external input to constrain them .",
    "one interesting avenue is to extract the support of gim penguins from @xmath101-related channels ( @xmath105 penguins ) in which they are not cabibbo - suppressed , and to use this support , including a possible @xmath101 breaking of @xmath106 , in the fit of @xmath9 penguin decays .",
    "alternatively , one can omit the calculation in factorization and fit directly the rgi parameters from the experimental data , instead of fitting the power - suppressed corrections  @xcite .",
    "we remark that :    * compared to factorization approaches , general parameterizations have less predictive power but are more general and thus best suited to search for np in a conservative way . *",
    "this method has the advantage that for several channels , to be discussed below , the predicted @xmath73 decreases with the experimental uncertainty in @xmath107 s and cp asymmetries of @xmath0 and @xmath101-related @xmath105 penguins .",
    "we conclude this section by remarking once again that neither the `` gim - penguin problem '' nor the `` tree problem '' can be solved from first principles and we must cope with model - dependent estimates .",
    "it then becomes very important to be able to study a variety of channels in several different approaches . in this way",
    ", we can hope to be able to make solid predictions and to test them with high accuracy . in the following",
    ", we quickly review the present theoretical and experimental results , keeping in mind the goal of testing the sm and looking for np .",
    "the aim of this section is to collect pre- and post - dictions for @xmath107 s and cp asymmetries of @xmath0 penguin decays obtained in the approaches briefly discussed in the previous section",
    ". the main focus will be on @xmath73 , but @xmath107 s and rate cp asymmetries will play a key role in assessing the reliability and the theoretical uncertainty of the different approaches .      in tables [ tab : pp]-[tab : pv ] we report some of the results obtained in the literature for @xmath7 decay @xmath107 s and cp asymmetries . for qcd factorization ( qcdf ) results , the first error corresponds to variations of ckm parameters , the second to variations of the renormalization scale , quark masses , decay constants ( except for transverse ones ) , form factors , and the @xmath108 mixing angle .",
    "the third error corresponds to the uncertainty due to the gegenbauer moments in the expansion of the light - cone distribution amplitudes , and also includes the scale - dependent transverse decay constants for vector mesons .",
    "finally , the last error corresponds to an estimate of the effect of the dominant power corrections .",
    "for pqcd results from refs .",
    "@xcite , the error only includes the variation of gegenbauer moments , of @xmath109 and of the ckm phase . for pqcd results from ref .",
    "@xcite , the errors correspond to input hadronic parameters , to scale dependence , and to ckm parameters respectively . for scet results ,",
    "the analysis is carried out at leading order in @xmath86 and @xmath75 assuming exact @xmath101 .",
    "the errors are estimates of @xmath101 breaking , of @xmath75 corrections and of the uncertainty due to scet parameters respectively .",
    "scet i and scet ii denote two possible solutions for scet parameters in the fit  @xcite . for general parametrization ( gp ) results ,",

    "therefore , although the idea of minimal flavor violation is phenomenologically appealing  @xcite , an equally possible alternative is that np is contributing more to @xmath576 transitions than to @xmath4 ones . within the class of @xmath576 transitions , ( chromo)-magnetic vertices are peculiar since they require a chirality flip to take place , which leads to a down - type quark mass suppression within the sm . on the other hand , np models can weaken this suppression if they contain additional heavy fermions and/or additional sources of chiral mixing . in this case",
    ", they can lead to spectacular enhancements for the coefficients of ( chromo)-magnetic operators .",
    "furthermore , if the relevant new particles are colored , they can naturally give a strong enhancement of chromomagnetic operators while magnetic operators might be only marginally modified @xcite .",
    "the electric dipole moment of the neutron puts strong constraints on new sources of cp violation in chirality - flipping flavor - conserving operators involving light quarks , but this does not necessarily imply the suppression of flavor - violating operators , especially those involving @xmath91 quarks . therefore , assuming that np is sizable in hadronic @xmath0 penguins is perfectly legitimate given the present information available on flavor physics .    from a theoretical point of view ,",
    "a crucial observation is the strong breaking of the sm @xmath577 flavor symmetry by the top quark yukawa coupling .",
    "this breaking necessarily propagates in the np sector , so that in general it is very difficult to suppress np contributions to cp violation in @xmath91 decays , and these np contributions could be naturally larger in @xmath0 transitions than in @xmath105 ones .",
    "this is indeed the case in several flavor models ( see for example ref .",

    "another interesting argument is the connection between quark and lepton flavor violation in grand unified models  @xcite .",

    "let us now focus on susy and discuss the phenomenological effects of the new sources of flavor and cp violation in @xmath0 processes that arise in the squark sector  @xcite .",
    "in general , in the mssm squark masses are neither flavor - universal , nor are they aligned to quark masses , so that they are not flavor diagonal in the super - ckm basis , in which quark masses are diagonal and all neutral current vertices are flavor diagonal . the ratios of off - diagonal squark mass terms to the average squark mass define four new sources of flavor violation in the @xmath0 sector : the mass insertions @xmath579 , with @xmath580 referring to the helicity of the corresponding quarks .",
