    "the unified model of active galactic nuclei ( agn ; @xcite ) states that most of the observational differences between type-1 and type-2 seyfert - like galaxies arise from an orientation effect . according to this theory ,",
    "the disappearance of ultraviolet ( uv ) and optical broad emission features at type-2 inclinations can be explained by the presence of an obscuring , circumnuclear material along the equatorial plane of the agn ( the so - called dusty torus ) that hides both the central engine and the photoionized broad line regions ( blrs ; the low ionization line lil blr and the highly ionized line hil blr ; @xcite ) . a type-2 viewing angle",
    "can then be defined as a line of sight towards the central source that intercepts the equatorial dust , while type-1 inclination allows a direct view of the central engine .",
    "the observational lack of type-1 agn with edge - on host galaxy @xcite suggests that dust along seyfert  1 galaxy discs may obscure the hil and lil blr and make the agn appear like seyfert  2s @xcite .",
    "the number count of seyfert  1 objects is thus expected to be small , even if the fraction of type-1 against type-2 agn in the nearby universe still needs to be properly determined .",
    "estimating the orientation of a large sample of agn is necessary to verify the assumptions of the unified model , and check whether all the differences between seyfert  1 and seyfert  2 objects can be explained by inclination or if morphological differences must also be taken into account .    in this",
    "regard , polarization has proven to be a solid tool to investigate the inner structure of agn .",
    "the spectropolarimetric measurements of ngc  1068 by @xcite helped to identify electron and dust scattering as the main mechanisms producing a continuum polarization in radio - quiet agn .",
    "going further , the extensive high - resolution , high signal - to - noise spectropolarimetric observation of the same agn by @xcite revealed the presence of highly polarized , broad , symmetric balmer and permitted fe  ii lines .",
    "the polarization spectrum was found to be closely similar to typical seyfert  1 galaxies , supporting the idea that seyfert  2 agn are hiding seyfert  1 core behind the dusty torus .",
    "this discovery was a key argument in favour of a unified model of agn .",
    "spectropolarimetry is thus a powerful method to probe the validity of any agn model , as the computed fluxes shall match both observational intensity , polarization percentage and polarization angle , reducing the number of free parameters / degeneracies @xcite . in order to model a peculiar source ,",
    "the observer s viewing angle @xmath4 has to be set ( e.g. @xmath5 70@xmath2 for ngc  1068 ; @xcite ) to explore the resulting polarization @xcite .",
    "the impact of the system s orientation on to the net polarization can lead to significantly different results , especially when the observer s line of sight matches the half - opening angle of the obscuring region @xcite . to be consistent with observation , an investigation of the model over a broad range of inclination must be undertaken .",
    "however , any comparison between the observed polarization and the theoretical orientation of individual agn is hampered by the lack of a data base that combines inclination and polarization .",

    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "while polarimetric measurement of agn are difficult to obtain due to intrinsically low polarization degrees in type-1 objects @xcite and flux dilution by unpolarized starlight in type-2s @xcite , it is more straightforward to measure polarization than to estimate the inclination of the system , as orientation is not easily derived directly from observations . hence , the following sections present different techniques to infer the orientation of agn ( with potential caveats discussed in sect .  [",
    "discussion : bias ] ) , the selection criteria used to select / remove estimated inclinations , corrections that have to be made to most of the seyfert-2 agn and the final compilation of data . for the remaining of this paper , the terminology `` inclination of the system '' will refer to the nuclear , not the host , inclination .",
    "method a. based on the tight correlation found by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite between the mass of the central supermassive black hole and the bulge velocity dispersion in nearby galaxies , @xcite and @xcite developed a method to derive the inclination angle of nearby seyfert  1 agn . by assuming a keplerian motion of the lil blr and a similar mass / velocity dispersion between type-1 agn and regular galaxies , they estimated the orientation angles @xmath4 for a variety of seyfert  1 objects , with associated errors calculated from the uncertainties of both the black hole mass ( obtained by reverberation mapping techniques ; @xcite ) and the measured velocity dispersion .",
    "method b. the inclination estimation of the seyfert  1 galaxy eso  323-g077 comes from the optical spectropolarimetric measurement achieved by @xcite , who detected very high levels of linear polarization ( up to 7.5  % at 3600   ) . within the framework of the unified model ,",
    "those levels are inconsistent with the polarization degrees produced by an object seen in the polar orientation @xcite .",
    "@xcite argued that the system must be partially hidden by the dusty torus and tilted by @xmath6  45@xmath2 with respect to the observer s line of sight to produce such a high polarization degree .",

    "is equally fitted within a schwarzschild or a kerr metric ( even if recent modelling seems to favour maximally rotating black holes in the centre of type-1 agn ; @xcite ) , giving a mean seyfert  1 inclination of 30@xmath2 .",

    "unfortunately , degeneracies in line profile fitting do not allow stronger constraints .",
    "method i. finally , @xcite investigated their own polarimetric and photometric observations of the type-2 quasar iras  13349 + 2438 in the context of an axisymmetric distribution of scatterers to explain the alignment of polarization with the major axis of the host galaxy . using a model of a dusty disc parallel to the plane of the galaxy , similar to a usual dusty torus , surrounding the continuum source and the lil blr",

    "such statement is supported by the spectropolarimetric observations realized by @xcite , who have shown that the observer s line of sight is probably intercepting part of the equatorial dusty material , classifying iras  13349 + 2438 as a borderline type-2 agn .",
    "thus , from a polarimetric point of view and if its estimated inclination is correct , the circinus galaxy should be considered as a borderline seyfert  2 object .",

    "finally , an important condition on the models investigated below is that , at least , they reproduce the expected polarization dichotomy ( i.e. parallel polarization position angles for type-1 inclinations and perpendicular polarization position angles for type-2s ) .      according to the axisymmetric unified model @xcite , the central supermassive black hole and its accretion disc , that radiates most of its bolometric luminosity in the uv / optical bands , are obscured by an equatorial , dusty torus .",
    "a common hypothesis is that the funnel of the torus collimates ejection winds in the form of a bi - conical polar outflow .",

    "we know from observations that , beyond the dust sublimation radius , the ionized outflows merge continuously with the dusty environment of the host galaxy , forming the so - called ( low - density ) nlr @xcite .",
    "the next step is then to investigate , in the framework of this compendium , the polarization signature of a four - component model that includes a dust - filled , low opacity ( @xmath38  =  0.3 ) nlr @xcite .",

    "similarly to the three and four - component models , a clumpy agn ( fig .",

    "however , due to multiple scattering on the outflow s clumps increasing the polarization degree , and gaps along the type-1 line of sights that allow a direct view of the electron disc , the net polarization percentage is higher , up to 2  % for intermediate inclinations .",
    "this level is still not sufficient to reproduce the observed polarization of highly polarized type-1 objects , but a fragmented medium enables higher polarization degrees for type-1 modelling .",

    ", @xmath3 is much lower ( @xmath42  3  % ) than in previous modellings due to the enhanced escape probability from the outflows .",
    "a fragmented model can match the lower limit on polarization of a large fraction of type-2 agn but fails to reproduce the high continuum polarization of ngc  1068 , mrk  78 , iras  13349 + 2438 or the circinus galaxy .",
    "however , the cloudlet distribution is probably different for each individual object and should be adapted case by case , i.e. by increasing / decreasing the filling factor . by increasing the filling factor of the clumpy outflows ,",

    "refer to @xcite for details about this choice of parameters .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : elvis ] ( bottom ) , it can be seen that the continuum polarization arising at type-1 inclinations follow the same trend as the three previous models : @xmath3 reaches a maximum value of 1  % and can not account for the highly polarized type-1 objects of the compendium .",
    "a local diminution of @xmath3 appears at @xmath4  =  42@xmath2 , when the observer s line of sight crosses the outflowing material .",
    "the polarization position angle then switches from parallel to perpendicular , with respect to the projected symmetry axis of the system . while the transition between parallel and perpendicular polarization occurs at a smaller @xmath4 in comparison with previous modelling , it is still coherent with the polarization position angle measurements of ngc  5548 and eso  323-g077 , which exhibit perpendicular polarization at @xmath4  =  47.3@xmath20 and @xmath4  =  45@xmath2 , respectively .",
    "beyond 54@xmath2 , when the observer s line of sight no longer passes through the radial outflows , @xmath3 reaches 10  %",

    "it is noteworthy that while a disc - born wind is by far the closest model to observations , one must be cautious as type-2 polarizations have first - order corrections and estimated inclinations are subject to potential biases .",
    "the polarization - versus - inclination study presented in this paper allows a test of the relevance of four different agn models from the literature .",

    "it is then easier to discriminate between several agn models at intermediate inclinations .",
    "models composed of uniform , homogeneous reprocessing regions ( an equatorial scattering disc , a dusty torus and a pair of collimated cones , with the possible addition of dusty nlr ) tend to create high perpendicular polarization degrees for type-2 agn , while the polarization produced by a model with fragmented polar outflows do not extend farther than 3  % in the same orientation range .",
    "moreover , in the case of the model with clumpy ionization cones , the transition between parallel and perpendicular polarization happens at typical type-2 inclinations , which is in disagreement with observations .",
    "a refinement of the clumpy model is necessary .",
    "a deeper analysis of fragmented media is ongoing , targeting equatorial scattering discs , lil and hil blr , tori , ionization cones and nlr .",
    "preliminary results show that the polarization degree at type-2 inclinations can rise up to few tens of percent for dense cloudlet distributions .",
    "the transition between parallel and perpendicular polarization is correlated with the half - opening angle of the torus , and a fragmented circumnuclear region with a half - opening angle of 45@xmath2 can produce a switch between parallel and perpendicular polarization position angle at @xmath6  60@xmath2 .",
    "the exploration of the parameter space of the models ( optical depth , filling factor , covering factor ... ) will be considered .",
    "the model of @xcite is undoubtedly the closest to observation , as it produces both high and low polarization degrees at type-2 viewing angle , strengthening the hypothesis that at least some undermined fraction of agn components are wind - like structures .      even by varying the parameters , none of the model can reach the high polarization levels of the inventoried type-1s eso  323-g077 ( 7.5  % ) , fairall  51 ( 4.12  % @xmath7 0.03  % ) , ic  4329a ( 5.80  %  @xmath7  0.26  % ) , mcg-6 - 30 - 15 ( 4.06  %  @xmath7  0.45  % ) , mrk  486 ( 3.40  %  @xmath7  0.14  % ) , mrk  766 ( 3.10  %  @xmath7  0.80  % ) , mrk  1239 ( 4.09  %  @xmath7  0.14  % ) or mrk  231 ( @xmath6  4  % ; @xcite ) .",
    "results presented in sect .  [ comp : survey ] show that their inclination ranges from 0@xmath2 to 45@xmath2 , indicating that scattering at large angles between the photon source , the polar winds and the observer is unlikely to be responsible for all the atypically high continuum polarization observed . as the optical thickness of agn polar outflows",
    "is estimated to be relatively small ( @xmath47  1 ) , the major contribution to scattering - induced type-1 polarization comes from the equatorial scattering disc .",
    "@xcite showed that the resulting polarization percentage from an equatorial , electron - filled disc is fairly low , independently of its half opening angle and thomson opacity .",
    "a major challenge to numerical models of agn is to increase the net polarization degree at type-1 viewing angles for isolated cases .",
    "it is even more challenging taking into account that the polarization position angle of five out of the seven objects ( eso  323-g077 , fairall  51 , mrk  486 , mrk  766 and ngc  3227 ) is found to be perpendicular to their radio axis , similarly to mrk  231 @xcite .",
    "there are several potential ways to strengthen the net polarization of the models .",
    "one can consider perpendicular scattering between the source , a reprocessing region located along the equatorial plane , and the observer",
    ". a promising target could be the hil and lil blr .",
    "considering the constraints on the hil and lil blr structure derived by @xcite , using kinematic measurements of emission lines in four nearby agn , one can estimate the half - opening angle of the emission line region . according to @xcite , the hils ( i.e. emitted close to the photoionizing source ) originate from a medium with half - opening angle 3.8@xmath2 ",
    "26@xmath2 from the equatorial plane , while the lils are created in a structure with a half - opening angle 11@xmath2  60@xmath2 .",
    "further tests must be achieved to explore the polarization position angle and the amount of parallel polarization that hil and lil blr can generate but it is unlikely that scattering within an axisymmetrical model can reach up to few percents at type-1 inclinations .    as stated by @xcite ,",
    "breaking the symmetric pattern of irradiation can help to understand the velocity dependence of broad emission line variability detected in many agn .",
    "strong off - axis flares could then explain the observed , extremely asymmetric , balmer lines with broad peak redshifted or blueshifted by thousands of km@xmath48s@xmath49 @xcite , and produce higher polarization degrees even at polar orientation .",
    "it is important to test the off - axis flare model as , if correct , the azimuthal phase of the continuum source would play a critical role in the measurement of the supermassive black hole mass .",
    "@xcite have recently started the investigation of the off - axis irradiation theory by looking at the velocity dependence of the polarization of the broad emission lines .",
    "preliminary results , compared to spectropolarimetric data for type-1 agn from the literature , indicate that both the degree and position angle of polarization should be affected by asymmetrical emission .",
    "the net polarization percentage of the optical continuum is also slightly stronger .",
    "further modelling will be achieved to explore how far optical and uv continuum polarization can be strengthened by temporary off - axis irradiation .",
    "finally , highly polarized agn are not uncommon in type-1 radio - loud objects , with @xmath3 up to 45.5  %  @xmath7  0.9  % @xcite .",
    "the net polarization is quite variable from the radio to the optical band , often on short time - scales , pointing towards well - ordered magnetic fields surrounding a spatially small emitting region .",
    "while most of the observed polarization of radio - quiet agn is undoubtedly originating from scattering off small particles @xcite , the high , optical polarization of blazing quasars is thought to be associated with doppler - boosted synchrotron emission from relativistic jets pointing towards us .",
    "the polarization position angle of blazar cores is usually perpendicular to the jet axis while a parallel component is detected for emerging superluminal knots @xcite .",
    "if electron and dust reprocessing appear to be unable to reach @xmath3  @xmath50  3  % along poloidal directions , the correct interpretation might lie somewhere in the middle .",
    "the presence of a sub - parsec , aborted jet has yet to be proven but could explain the time variability and spectra of narrow line seyfert  1 galaxies @xcite and potentially create perpendicular polarization degree up to a few percent , while the lines and continuum polarization would be still mainly produced by reprocessing . if an undetermined fraction of the total polarization of highly polarized type-1 agn indeed originates from synchrotron emission , the net polarization could be expected to vary , but with a much smaller amplitude than for synchrotron - dominated , radio - loud objects .",
    "long term monitoring of radio - quiet , highly - polarized type-1 agn would then help to evaluate the fraction of polarization arising from reprocessing and from synchrotron emission .",
    "estimations made by @xcite and @xcite are primarily based on the assumptions that seyfert  1 and normal galaxies follow the same black hole mass  =  5 was used by @xcite . ] - bulge velocity dispersion correlation , and that the lil blr are in pure keplerian rotation , coplanar to the system inclination . while detected , the motion and the morphology of the lil blr remain uncertain @xcite .",
    "there are no strong constraints from the emission line profiles as a wide variety of kinematic models are able to reproduce the non - gaussian profiles detected in agn @xcite .",
    "the technique of velocity - resolved reverberation mapping @xcite is a step forward and tends to rule out any significant outflow from the agn , while detecting a slight inflow @xcite and fast keplerian motion .",
    "fitting the distorted red wing of the fe k@xmath8 fluorescent line in x - ray bright , type-1 agn can lead to possible bias .",
    "the procedure used by @xcite assumes that the asymmetrical broadening of the iron line is caused by doppler and general relativistic effects close to the central black hole ; however , a competitive mechanism was proposed by @xcite and @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "line broadening occurs at larger distances from the accretion disc , where a distribution of cold , absorbing gas blocks a fraction of the initial continuum .",
    "transmitted and scattered radiation through the cloudlet environment finally carves out the distorted red wing .",
    "if distant absorption dominates relativistic effects , the estimated inclinations might then be questionable .",
    "the method developed by @xcite , based on the work achieved by @xcite and @xcite , relies on the nature of the nlr kinematics to determine the orientation of the system .",
    "one of their fundamental hypothesis is consistent with the unified model : agn are axisymmetrical objects . in this picture",
    ", the nlr structure sustains the same symmetry axis as the dusty torus , which is coplanar with the accretion disc .",
    "thus , determining the inclination of the nlr is equivalent to determining the orientation of the whole system .",
    "however , a recent ir interferometric campaign carried out by @xcite found that the extended outflows of ngc  1068 are likely to be inclined by 18@xmath2 with respect to the obscuring torus axis .",

    "this range of inclination is likely to include agn classified as borderline objects , where the observer s line of sight crosses the horizon of the equatorial dusty medium .",
    "four objects lie in this range , three of them ( eso  323-g077 , ngc  1365 and iras  13349 + 2438 ) being already considered as borderline seyfert galaxies from spectroscopic observations . if the estimated inclination of the fourth object ( the circinus galaxy ) is correct , it should be considered as another borderline agn . *",
    "the usual axisymmetric agn models have difficulties to reproduce the trend of polarization with inclination . fragmenting the reprocessing regions",

    "<S> the anisotropic nature of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is thought to be responsible for the observational differences between type-1 ( pole - on ) and type-2 ( edge - on ) nearby seyfert - like galaxies . in this picture , the detection of emission and/or absorption features is directly correlated to the inclination of the system . </S>",
    "<S> the agn structure can be further probed by using the geometry - sensitive technique of polarimetry , yet the pairing between observed polarization and seyfert type remains poorly examined . </S>",
    "<S> based on archival data , i report here the first compilation of 53 estimated agn inclinations matched with ultraviolet / optical continuum polarization measurements . </S>",
    "<S> corrections , based on the polarization of broad emission lines , are applied to the sample of seyfert-2 agn to remove dilution by starburst light and derive information about the scattered continuum alone . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting compendium agrees with past empirical results , i.e. type-1 agn show low polarization degrees ( @xmath0  1  % ) predominantly associated with a polarization position angle parallel to the projected radio axis of the system , while type-2 objects show stronger polarization percentages ( @xmath1  7  % ) with perpendicular polarization angles . </S>",
    "<S> the transition between type-1 and type-2 inclination occurs between 45@xmath2 and 60@xmath2 without noticeable impact on @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the compendium is further used as a test to investigate the relevance of four agn models . </S>",
    "<S> while an agn model with fragmented regions matches observations better than uniform models , a structure with a failed dusty wind along the equator and disc - born , ionized , polar outflows is by far closer to observations . </S>",
    "<S> however , although the models correctly reproduce the observed dichotomy between parallel and perpendicular polarization , as well as correct polarization percentages at type-2 inclinations , further work is needed to account for some highly polarized type-1 agn    [ firstpage ]    polarization  radiative transfer  scattering  atlases  galaxies : active  galaxies : structure . </S>"
