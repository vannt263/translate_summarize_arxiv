    "in the current paradigm of galaxy formation , galaxy discs are considered to form from the accretion of gas inside hierarchically growing cold dark matter ( cdm ) haloes ( see mo , van den bosch & white 2010 for a comprehensive overview ) . the dark matter ( dm ) and",
    "gas acquire angular momentum via tidal torques in the early universe ( peebles 1969 ) .",
    "when gas accretes onto the central galaxy , this angular momentum may eventually halt the collapse and lead to the formation of a rotationally supported disc ( fall & efstathiou 1980 ) .",
    "if the specific angular momentum of the baryons is conserved during galaxy formation , there is enough angular momentum to make galaxy discs with the observed sizes ( e.g. , dalcanton 1997 ; mo , mao , & white 1998 ; firmani & avila - reese 2000 ; de jong & lacey 2000 ; navarro & steinmetz 2000 ) .",
    "in fact , models in which galaxies have @xmath7 lower specific angular momentum than their dark matter haloes may be preferred ( dutton 2007 ) .",
    "another success of this picture is that the large variation in the specific angular momentum of dark matter haloes , at fixed halo mass , explains the large scatter in disc sizes , or equivalently surface brightnesses , at fixed luminosity ( dalcanton 1997 ) .",
    "this picture also accounts for the time evolution of disc sizes ( somerville 2008 ; firmani & avila - reese 2009 ; dutton 2011a ) , reproducing the observed weak evolution since redshift @xmath8 ( barden 2005 ) , and the stronger evolution observed from @xmath9 to @xmath10 ( trujillo 2006 ; williams 2010 ) .",
    "despite the many successes of these models , all of which assume that specific angular momentum is conserved during galaxy formation , there are several reasons , from a physical point of view , as to why the ratio between the specific angular momentum of the baryons and that of the dark matter halo , denoted @xmath5 , where @xmath11 is the ratio between the _ angular momentum _ of the disc and dark matter halo , and @xmath12 is the ratio between the _ mass _ of the disc and dark matter halo . ] , might be different from unity :    1 .",
    "selective accretion of baryons .",
    "if not all available baryons make it into the galaxy , the specific angular momentum of the galaxy can be either higher ( @xmath13 ) or lower ( @xmath14 ) than that of all baryons ( whether it is higher or lower simply depends on the specific angular momentum distribution of the materials that _ are _ selected ) .",
    "an example of a selective accretion process is cooling .",
    "cooling is generally an inside - out process , with the inner regions cooling prior to the more outer regions .",
    "since the mass of haloes is more concentrated than the specific angular momentum ( see e.g. , navarro & steinmetz 1997 ) , one expects that @xmath14 if not all baryons manage to cool .",
    "2 .   exchange of angular momentum between the dark matter and the baryons .",
    "an example of this is dynamical friction , which transfers orbital angular momentum from the baryons to the dark matter , thus resulting in @xmath14 ( e.g. , navarro & benz 1991 ; navarro & white 1994 ) .",
    "the strength of this process depends on the efficiency of star formation at early times .",
    "if the formation of baryonic clumps can be suppressed , such as through strong feedback , then the angular momentum transfer is reduced ( e.g. , weil , eke & efstathiou 1998 ; sommer - larsen , gelato & vedel 1999 ; eke , efstathiou & wright 2000 ) .",
    "3 .   feedback .",
    "if feedback ( from supernova , agn or any other mechanism ) results in the removal of gas , one can achieve values for @xmath5 that are very different from unity by simply removing a specific subset of the baryons .",
    "as an example , several studies have argued that supernova feedback affects low angular momentum material more than high angular momentum material , causing a net increase of @xmath5 ( maller & dekel 2002 ; dutton & van den bosch 2009 ; dutton 2009 ; governato 2010 ; brook 2011 ) .",
    "cosmological hydrodynamical simulations almost invariably predict that disc galaxies have significantly less specific angular momentum than their dark matter haloes ( @xmath14 ) , suggesting that mechanisms ( i ) and ( ii ) discussed above play an important role .",
    "early simulations in a standard cold dark matter ( scdm ) cosmology ( i.e. @xmath15 ) resulted in a catastrophic loss of angular momentum ( navarro & benz 1991 ; navarro & white 1994 ; steinmetz & navarro 1999 ) , producing discs an order of magnitude too small . more recent simulations in @xmath16 cold dark matter ( @xmath17 ) cosmologies have resulted in less angular momentum loss , but typical ratios between the specific angular momentum of the baryons and that of the dark matter are @xmath18 ( piontek & steinmetz 2011 ; sales 2010 ) .",
    "this `` angular momentum loss '' is sometimes attributed to lack of numerical resolution ( e.g. governato 2004 ; kaufmann 2007 ) .",
    "however , piontek & steinmetz ( 2009 ) argue that the dominant cause is dynamical friction between clumps of baryons and the dark matter halo .",
    "if , based on these findings , we assume that angular momentum loss is a natural feature of disc galaxy formation in a universe , a relevant question is the following : _ if the baryons that make up a discy galaxy carry half the specific angular momentum of the dark matter halo in which they reside , is it possible to reproduce in detail the observed sizes of disc galaxies _ ?",
    "this question was addressed by navarro & steinmetz ( 2000 ) . using scaling relations between disc size , luminosity , and rotation velocity",
    ", these authors derived an expression for @xmath5 ( @xmath19 in their notation ) that depends on the galaxy formation efficiency , @xmath20 ( @xmath21 in their notation ) , cosmic matter density , @xmath22 , and stellar mass - to - light ratio , @xmath23 .",
    "they found that if the rotation speeds of galaxy discs are approximately the same as the circular velocities of their surrounding haloes ( which has subsequently been shown to be the case , at least on average , by dutton 2010b ) , then discs must have retained about half of the available specific angular momentum during their assembly .",
    "another result from this analysis is that disc galaxies forming in low density cosmogonies , such as @xmath17 , need to have @xmath24 , that is , they draw a larger fraction of the specific angular momentum than the galaxy formation efficiency .",
    "this is at odds with the expectation ( see   [ sec : cooling ] below ) that @xmath25 if the galaxy formation efficiency is mainly determined by the inefficiency of cooling",
    ".    thus observational measurements of the specific angular momentum in galaxies place constraints on the way galaxies acquire their mass and angular momentum .",
    "the specific angular momentum of the dark matter , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the total angular momentum , and @xmath28 is the total virial mass , is commonly expressed in terms of the dimensionless spin parameter ( peebles 1969 ) : @xmath29 here @xmath30 is the halo s energy , @xmath31 is the virial radius , @xmath32 is the circular velocity at the virial radius , and @xmath33 measures the deviation of @xmath30 from that of a singular isothermal sphere truncated at @xmath31 .",
    "it is common to set @xmath34 ( bullock 2001 ) , so that the spin parameter only depends on the total angular momentum and mass of the halo . in this case",
    "the spin parameter is denoted @xmath35 .",
    "the equivalent spin parameter for the galaxy is defined as @xmath36 ( see section  [ sec : def ] for details ) .",
    "dark matter only cosmological simulations have shown that both @xmath37 and @xmath38 are log - normally distributed ( e.g. , bullock 2001 ) with median and scatter independent of halo mass ( e.g. , macci 2007 ; bett 2007 ; muoz - cuartas 2011 ) and independent of environment ( lemson & kauffmann 1999 , macci 2007 ) . for relaxed haloes identified with a spherical overdensity ( so ) algorithm macci ( 2008 ) find a median value of @xmath39 .",
    "using a similar halo definition bett ( 2007 ) find a median @xmath40 .",
    "for the cosmology adopted by bett , @xmath41 for a @xmath42 halo , and thus @xmath43 , which is in excellent agreement with the results of macci ( 2008 ) .",
    "simulations with gas in which there is no cooling find similar spin parameters for the baryons and dark matter ( van den bosch 2002 ; sharma & steinmetz 2005 ) .",
    "thus in what follows we assume that the median spin parameter of the halo is @xmath44    the main goal of this paper is to determine the average value of @xmath5 for a large sample of disc galaxies as a function of their halo mass , and to use semi - analytical models to explore implications for how disc galaxies form . since it is impossible to measure the specific angular momentum ( or spin parameter ) of a real ( as opposed to simulated ) dark matter halo",
    ", one can only obtain an estimate for the _ average _ value of @xmath5 by comparing the _ distribution _ of galaxy spin parameters , @xmath45 , obtained from a sample of galaxies to the _ distribution _ of halo spin parameters , @xmath38 , obtained from numerical simulations of structure formation in a cosmology .",
    "this is the approach we will follow in this paper .",
    "measuring @xmath45 for an individual galaxy necessarily involves the following steps :    1 .",
    "determine the specific angular momentum of the baryons .",
    "2 .   determine the mass ( and virial radius ) of the dark matter halo in which the galaxy resides .",
    "step ( i ) is relatively straightforward .",
    "using that , for a disc galaxy , @xmath46 it is clear that one can determine the angular momentum of a disc galaxy from measurements of its surface mass density , @xmath47 , ( accounting for both gas and stars ) , and its rotation curve @xmath48 ( see e.g. , van den bosch , burkert & swaters 2001 ) .",
    "alternative , since disc galaxies in general have exponential surface density profiles and flat rotation curves , one can use simple scaling relations between mass ( or luminosity ) , size and characteristic rotation velocity in order to obtain an estimate of @xmath49 without having to measure @xmath47 or @xmath48 ( e.g. , navarro & steinmetz 2000 ; tonini 2006 ; hernandez & cervantes - sodi 2006 ; hernandez 2007 ; berta 2008 ) . although less accurate than using eq .  (",
    "[ eq : jgal ] ) , this method has the advantage that it can be applied to much larger samples of galaxies . step ( ii ) is a little bit more involved . typically , accurate measurements of halo mass require probes on scales of the virial radius . examples of such ` probes ' are gravitational lensing , x - ray data and satellite kinematics . however , unless the galaxy in question is the central galaxy of a cluster - sized halo , such measurements are rarely available for individual systems , and one has to rely on uncertain estimates of the halo mass from the galaxy s rotation curve .",
    "alternatively , one can use various statistical techniques to assign to each galaxy an _ average _ halo mass .",
    "recent years have seen dramatic progress in using a variety of techniques to constrain the average relation between galaxy properties ( typically luminosity of stellar mass ) and halo mass , in particular from galaxy clustering ( e.g. , yang , mo & van den bosch 2003 ; tinker 2005 ) , galaxy - galaxy lensing ( e.g , mandelbaum 2006 ; cacciato 2009 ) , abundance matching ( e.g. , conroy , wechsler & kravtsov 2006 ) , and satellite kinematics ( e.g. , more 2009 ) .    in this paper",
    "we compute the average specific angular momentum and spin parameters of disc galaxies as a function of their halo mass .",
    "we improve on previous studies in a number of ways .",
    "we constrain halo masses using recent results for the halo mass - stellar mass relation for disc galaxies obtained from weak gravitational lensing and satellite kinematics ( dutton 2010b ) , rather than abundance matching results as in tonini ( 2006 ) , or the highly questionable assumption of a constant galaxy mass fraction made by hernandez & cervantes - sodi ( 2006 ) , hernandez ( 2007 ) , and berta ( 2008 ) .",
    "we also improve upon these studies by taking account of realistic uncertainties on halo masses .",
    "we consider both stellar and gaseous discs , rather than just stellar discs , which is important for low mass galaxies which tend to be gas rich ( tonini 2006 ) .",
    "we calculate disc angular momentum by integrating a model that is constructed to reproduce the size - mass and velocity - mass ( i.e. , tully - fisher , tully & fisher 1977 ) relations , rather than simple scaling arguments for exponential discs in isothermal haloes ( i.e. , @xmath50 ) , as used by e.g. , navarro & steinmetz ( 2000 ) and hernandez ( 2007 )",
    ". we also discuss how uncertainties related to stellar mass - to - light ratios and adiabatic contraction impact the inferred values of @xmath5 , and use simple models of disc galaxy formation to discuss the implications of our findings for cooling , outflows and angular momentum loss .",
    "we adopt a flat cosmology with matter density parameter @xmath51 , baryon density @xmath52 , and hubble parameter @xmath53 .",
    "dark matter halo masses are defined so that the mean density of the halo ( assumed to be spherical ) is 200 times the critical density .",
    "this section gives a brief overview of the main parameters we discuss in this paper , and the constrained mass models we use to constrain them .",
    "there are four main parameters that are relevant for what follows : galaxy mass , @xmath54 , halo virial mass , @xmath28 , galaxy angular momentum , @xmath55 , and the angular momentum of the dark matter halo , @xmath27 .",
    "the galaxy mass is the sum of the mass in stars and cold gas .",
    "the virial mass is the total mass ( stars , cold gas , hot gas , dark matter ) within the virial radius .",
    "the galaxy angular momentum is the sum of the angular momenta of the stars and of the cold gas .",
    "the virial angular momentum is the total angular momentum within the virial radius .",
    "our main goal is to constrain the angular momentum ratio , @xmath5 , defined as the ratio between the galaxy specific angular momentum and the total specific angular momentum is not an efficiency because it can be larger than unity . ] : @xmath56 where the spin parameters @xmath38 and @xmath45 are defined by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : spin ] ) and  ( [ eq : lamprime ] ) , respectively . using that for disc galaxies @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the disc scale length and @xmath59 is a characteristic rotation velocity of the disc",
    ", one can use eq .",
    "( [ eq : rj ] ) to show that @xmath60 which is the standard approach used in analytical and semi - analytical models to predict the sizes of disc galaxies ( e.g. , kauffmann 1996 ; mo , mao & white 1998 ; somerville & primack 1999 ; van den bosch 2000 ; cole 2000 ) . in many cases these studies simplify eq .",
    "( [ eq : rj ] ) by assuming that @xmath61 and that @xmath62 is a constant . in this paper",
    "we examine whether there is empirical support for the former assumption and what this implies for the formation of disc galaxies in general .",
    "as we will demonstrate , it is instructive to compare @xmath5 to the galaxy formation efficiency parameter @xmath63 which describes what fraction of the cosmologically available baryons have ended up in a galaxy .",
    "we compute the _ average _ value for @xmath5 for disc galaxies using the mass models of dutton ( 2011b ) , which have been constructed to reproduce the observed structural and dynamical scaling relations of late - type ( i.e. , star - forming and disc - dominated ) galaxies .",
    "they consist of four components : a stellar bulge , a stellar disc , a gas disc , and a dark matter halo . both the bulge and the dark matter halo",
    "are assumed to be spherical and to follow a density distribution that is given by a hernquist profile ( hernquist 1990 ) and a nfw profile ( navarro , frenk , & white 1997 ) , respectively .",
    "the density profile of the halo , however , is modified to account for the gravitational response to galaxy formation ( most often modelled as adiabatic contraction , see blumenthal et al .",
    "the disc is assumed to have an exponential surface density and to be infinitesimally thin .",
    "each halo - galaxy system is described by nine parameters : three for the halo ( virial mass , @xmath28 , concentration , @xmath64 , and a parameter that describes the impact of galaxy formation on the halo density profile ) ; and six for the baryons ( stellar mass , @xmath65 , gas mass , @xmath66 , bulge fraction , @xmath67 , bulge size , @xmath68 , stellar disc size , @xmath58 , and gas disc size , @xmath69 ) .",
    "the 6 parameters for the baryons are constrained by the observed scaling relations : @xmath68 _ vs. _ @xmath65 ; @xmath58 _ vs. _ @xmath65 ; @xmath70 _ vs. _ @xmath65 ; @xmath67 _ vs. _ @xmath65 , and @xmath71 _ vs. _ @xmath65 ( see dutton 2011b for details ) . for the relation between @xmath28 and @xmath65 we use the empirical relation from dutton ( 2010b ) , which is inferred from a large number of independent studies and techniques , including galaxy - galaxy lensing , satellite kinematics , galaxy clustering , and abundance matching .",
    "we will use the scatter among these different studies / techniques , as an estimate for the uncertainty in the @xmath28 _ vs. _ @xmath65 relation , and propagate these uncertainties to those on @xmath6 and @xmath5 .",
    "finally , the relation between halo mass , @xmath28 , and halo concentration , @xmath64 , is taken from macci ( 2008 ) , and is calibrated using high - resolution numerical simulations .",
    "the usage of all these empirical and theoretical scaling relations implies that the nine model parameters can be reduced to two primary unknowns : the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) , and a prescription for how galaxy growth influences the structural properties of the dark matter halo ( hereafter `` the halo contraction model '' ) .",
    "it is common practice to assume that disc formation is an adiabatic process and that the halo responds by contracting using the adiabatic contraction ( hereafter ac ) prescription of blumenthal ( 1986 ; hereafter bffp ) .",
    "however , numerical simulations have shown that this prescription may not be sufficiently accurate , and several alternatives have been proposed ( e.g. , gnedin 2004 ; abadi 2010 ) . we follow dutton ( 2007 ) and use a generalized halo contraction model , according to which a shell of dark matter initially ( before disc formation ) at radius @xmath72 ends up , after disc formation , at a radius @xmath73 here @xmath74 is the amount of contraction as predicted by the ac - model of bffp , and @xmath75 is a free parameter .",
    "note that @xmath76 corresponds to the standard adiabatic contraction model of bffp , while the gnedin ( 2004 ) and abadi ( 2010 ) models can be well approximated by @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively . a model without contraction",
    "has @xmath79 , while @xmath80 indicates that the dark matter halo responds to disc formation by expanding .    as shown in dutton ( 2011b ) ,",
    "reproducing the observed tully - fisher relation implies different values for @xmath75 for a different choice of the imf . in this paper",
    "we will consider two different models that fit the tully - fisher relation ( and all other scaling relations mentioned above ) equally well : model  a which adopts a chabrier ( 2003 ) imf and @xmath81 ( i.e. , halo expansion ) , and model  b , in which we adopt the ac model of gnedin ( 2004 ) , i.e. , we set @xmath77 , and we assume an imf that yields stellar mass - to - light ratios that are 0.3 dex lower than for the chabrier ( 2003 ) imf .",
    "as shown in dutton ( 2011b ) both these models are in excellent agreement with the data .",
    "as we will show below , model  b results in galaxy spin parameters that are @xmath82 percent ( @xmath83 dex ) higher than those of model  a. this uncertainty is comparable to that arising from the uncertainty in the @xmath28 _ vs. _ @xmath65 relation . throughout",
    "we will mainly present the results for model  a , while occasionally showing , for comparison , the results for model  b.    for a given choice of imf and @xmath75 , the model completely specifies the mass distributions of disc - plus - bulge galaxies as a function of halo mass . from these mass models we compute the angular momentum of the baryons by evaluating eq .",
    "[ eq : jgal ] , where the surface density is the sum of the surface densities of the gas and stars : @xmath84 .",
    "we assume that the bulge has no net angular momentum .",
    "if we assumed that bulges follow the same rotation curve as the disc , then this would increase the specific angular momentum of the galaxy by @xmath85 .",
    "the effect is largest for the most massive galaxies , but since massive bulges , in general , are not rotationally supported , we believe our assumption that bulges have no angular momentum to be of no major concern for what follows .",
    "a shown by tonini ( 2006 ) a significant fraction of the angular momentum of a galaxy is in the cold gas . in our models",
    "the cold gas in high mass galaxies ( @xmath86 ) contains @xmath87 of the angular momentum .",
    "this fraction rises to over 50% for galaxy masses below @xmath88 .",
    "thus if cold gas fractions increase at higher redshifts , as is commonly thought ( but see dutton 2010a ) , measuring angular momentum of high redshift galaxies will require measurements of the distribution of cold gas , and not just the stars .",
    "using our constrained mass models we now discuss a number of correlations between mass and angular momentum of disc galaxies and dark matter haloes , and compare with previous results .",
    "these correlations are presented in figs .",
    "[ fig : jmvir]-[fig : spin ] and table  [ tab : data ] .",
    "the left - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : jmvir ] shows the correlation between galaxy specific angular momentum and virial mass for model  a. the shaded regions show the one and two @xmath89 uncertainties in virial masses at fixed galaxy mass , which is the dominant source of uncertainty .",
    "the dashed line shows the relation between virial specific angular momentum and virial mass from cosmological n - body simulations ( macci 2008 ) , which corresponds to a spin parameter of @xmath90 . the galaxy specific angular momentum scales with virial mass as @xmath91 , which is very similar to the virial scaling of @xmath92 .",
    "thus the ratio @xmath5 between the galaxy and virial specific angular momentum is roughly constant ( right - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : jmvir ] ) .",
    "however , the galaxy specific angular momentum is significantly lower than the virial specific angular momentum with @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) for a virial mass of @xmath95 .",
    "the dashed line in the right - hand panel of fig .  [ fig : jmvir ] corresponds to model  b , and is shown for comparison .",
    "note that the combination of halo contraction and lower stellar mass - to - light ratios result in @xmath5 values that are @xmath96 higher than for our fiducial model  a. this difference is comparable to the 1@xmath89 uncertainty on @xmath5 due to the uncertainties in the relation between stellar mass and halo mass .",

[",

    "the normalization is @xmath105 lower than predicted for haloes ( dashed line ) .",
    "there are two simple interpretations of this result .",
    "one is that the baryons that form disc galaxies have lost about 40% of their angular momentum during galaxy formation , which could occur via dynamical friction .",
    "another is that the baryons that form disc galaxies have 40% lower specific angular momentum than the cosmically available baryons , which could occur due to feedback and/or inefficient cooling .",
    "we discuss these interpretations in more detail in ",
    "[ sec : theory ] .",
    "an interpretation advocated by tonini ( 2006 ) is that if one restricts attention to haloes that have not experienced a major merger since @xmath106 , the average spin parameters @xmath107 turns out to be around 0.023 ( donghia & burkert 2004 ) .",
    "this is motivated by the idea that bulge - less disc galaxies require a quiescent merger history . however",
    ", this simple expectation has been cast into doubt by numerical simulations which have shown that ( gas rich ) discs can survive major mergers ( e.g. , springel & hernquist 2005 ; hopkins 2009 ) .",
    "while we can not rule out a merger history bias for massive disc galaxies , we argue that such a bias can not occur for low mass galaxies ( @xmath108 , @xmath109 ) because typical low mass galaxies are bulge - less , and thus must form in haloes with typical merger histories ( and hence typical halo spins ) .      as a reference , the black pentagons and light blue shaded regions in figs .",
    "[ fig : jmvir ] & [ fig : mmvir ] show estimates for the specific angular momentum and mass of the milky way ( mw ) .",
    "here we have estimated the specific angular momentum of the mw assuming @xmath110 , which is appropriate for an exponential disc with a flat rotation curve .",
    "we adopt @xmath111 based on the dynamical models of widrow ( 2008 ) and @xmath112 from the observations of reid ( 1999 ) . for the baryonic mass of the mw we use the bulge and disc masses , again from the dynamical models of widrow ( 2008 ) to obtain @xmath113 @xmath114 . for the virial mass of the mw we average the results of smith ( 2007 ) and xue ( 2008 ) yielding @xmath115 @xmath116 .    the resulting galaxy spin parameter ( see eq.2 ) and galaxy formation efficiency ( see eq.7 ) of the mw are @xmath117 ( 2@xmath89 ) , and @xmath118 @xmath116 , respectively .",
    "both @xmath104 and @xmath6 are higher than for typical late - type galaxies .",
    "this could signify that the mw is atypical , or it could simply be a reflection of the measurement errors ( especially in halo masses ) both for the mw and for samples of late - type galaxies .      several studies in the past used similar methods to determine the spin parameters of disc galaxies .",
    "these studies all find higher spin parameters than we find here , but as we show the differences can be ascribed to differences in the estimation of halo masses , which is the dominant source of systematic uncertainty in measuring the spin parameter .",
    "van den bosch , burkert & swaters ( 2001 ; hereafter bbs01 ) used eq .",
    "( [ eq : jgal ] ) and halo masses inferred from rotation curve modelling to determine the galaxy spin parameters for a sample of 14 disc - dominated dwarf galaxies .",
    "they found that @xmath119 ( see fig .  [ fig : bbs ] ) , albeit with a relatively large uncertainty due to the small sample size and the uncertainties in the stellar mass - to - light ratios and halo masses . at first sight , this is much larger than the average galaxy spin parameters inferred here ; @xmath120 .",
    "however , there are several factors that can account for this large difference .",
    "bbs01 used dark halo masses and sizes derived from fits to rotation curves assuming adiabatic contraction . since the rotation curves only extend to @xmath121 of the halo virial radius , this involves a significant extrapolation , and thus the potential for systematic errors . as discussed in detail in dutton ( 2007 ) , the assumption that disc formation results in adiabatic contraction of its dark matter halo may not be realistic .",
    "the galaxies in bbs01 have a median @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is the rotation velocity at the last measured point ( i.e. , at the largest radius ) .",
    "since dark matter haloes in the concordance cosmology have @xmath124 , where @xmath125 is the maximum circular velocity , the derived values from bbs01 are _ strongly _ influenced by the assumption of adiabatic contraction .",

    "this model is a simplified version of the galaxy formation model from dutton & van den bosch ( 2009 ) . briefly",
    "this model consists of nfw haloes that grow by smooth accretion of baryons and dark matter .",
    "the angular momentum of each shell of accreted gas is determined by assuming that the angular momentum distribution ( amd ) of a given halo is independent of time .",
    "the amd is specified by two parameters : the normalization ( @xmath146 ) and shape ( @xmath147 ) . when the baryons enter the halo they are shock heated to the virial temperature .",
    "the cooling time depends on the temperature , density and metallicity of the hot gas .",
    "we use the metallicity dependent collisional ionization equilibrium cooling functions of sutherland & dopita ( 1993 ) .",
    "results for four different metallicities from primordial to one third solar are shown .",
    "for low mass haloes ( @xmath148 ) cooling is very efficient , so that @xmath149 of the baryonic mass is accreted ( left - hand panels ) . for more massive haloes ,",
    "the galaxy formation efficiency , @xmath6 , depends strongly on the metallicity of the gas , with higher metallicities yielding larger values of @xmath6 .",
    "clearly , the trend that @xmath6 decreases with increasing halo mass is completely opposite to the empirical result . as for the parameter @xmath5",
    ", the simple cooling models predict that @xmath5 should decrease with increasing halo mass , which is a consequence of cooling being an inside - out process combined with the fact that mass is more centrally concentrated than angular momentum ( cf .",
    "[ fig : jdmd ] ) .",
    "hence , in massive haloes where @xmath150 due to inefficient cooling , the galaxy ends up having less specific angular momentum than its dark matter halo .",
    "this strong mass dependence of @xmath5 is again inconsistent with our empirical results .",
    "finally , the cooling models predicts an almost linear relation between @xmath5 and @xmath6 , which is independent of the gas metallicity ( lower right - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : erm ] ) . clearly , this linear relation is very different from its empirical equivalent , indicating that additional mechanisms for accreting and/or expelling gas are required .",
    "we now consider two modifications to the simple cooling model : outflows and angular momentum loss .",
    "we assume that outflows , which move at the local escape velocity , are driven by energy from supernovae ( sne ) .",
    "the fraction of the sne energy that goes into an outflow is specified by the free parameter @xmath151 ( see van den bosch 2002 ; dutton & van den bosch 2009 ) .",
    "other than inefficient cooling in massive haloes , and uv heating in low mass haloes , galactic outflows are the primary mechanism for explaining the observed low galaxy formation efficiencies ( e.g. , dekel & silk 1986 ; cole 1994 ) . for simplicity , we assume that outflow gas leaves the disc and halo , and does not return . however , recent cosmological hydrodynamical simulations have shown that ejected gas may return to the galaxy ( oppenheimer 2010 ) . some of the ejected gas may mix with the halo gas and thus re - accrete with higher specific angular momentum ( brook 2012 ) .",
    "since this process is a re - distribution ( i.e. , ejected gas gains angular momentum , halo gas loses angular momentum ) , it does not change the specific angular momentum of the baryons .",
    "if the halo gas accretes onto the central galaxy ( as is expected for low mass , @xmath152 , haloes ) then there is no net change in the angular momentum of the galaxy .",
    "if the halo gas does not accrete ( which is expected for high mass haloes ) then the galaxy can gain angular momentum via this galactic fountain effect .",
    "thus if we were to implement re - accretion into our model we would need higher feedback efficiencies to achieve the same galaxy formation efficiencies , but to first order there would be no change to the specific angular momentum .",
    "we assume that during the accretion process , a fraction @xmath153 of the angular momentum of the gas is lost to the dark matter halo .",
    "the mechanism responsible for this transfer is dynamical friction . in our models",
    "we do not take into account the effects of angular momentum transfer and outflows on the structure of the dark matter halo .",
    "but we note that both of these processes will result in halo expansion , or at least a reduction of the amount of adiabatic contraction , i.e. , a lower effective value of @xmath75 ( e.g. , navarro 1996 ; el - zant 2001 ; mo & mao 2004 ; cole , dehnen & wilkinson 2011 )    in fig .",
    "[ fig : erm2 ] we show several models with different values of @xmath151 and @xmath153 . in all models",

    "[ fig : erm ] and is shown for comparison .",
    "the galaxy formation efficiencies are too high for all halo masses . in order to produce realistic galaxy formation efficiencies outflows",
    "are needed .",
    "a model with @xmath156 and @xmath155 ( short dashed line ) has @xmath157 . in our model outflows increase @xmath5 by preferentially removing gas with low specific angular momentum . since",
    "outflows are driven by star formation , regions that have higher star formation rates have higher mass outflow rates .",
    "star formation is empirically more efficient at smaller galactic radii ( kennicutt 1998 ) as well as at higher redshifts ( e.g. , noeske 2007 ; daddi 2007 ; elbaz 2007 ) .",
    "smaller galactic radii correspond to lower specific angular momentum and discs are smaller at higher redshifts ( e.g. , dutton 2011a ) ; both of these effects contribute to outflows increasing the specific angular momentum of the material that remains in the galaxy . in our energy driven outflow model",
    "the mass loading factor ( @xmath158 outflow rate / star formation rate ) is higher in lower mass galaxies , which results in @xmath5 increasing more in lower mass haloes ( by up to a factor two ) .",
    "this increases the disagreement with the empirically inferred relation between @xmath5 and halo mass .",
    "we can lower @xmath5 by introducing angular momentum loss ( i.e. , setting @xmath159 ) .",
    "the long dashed - dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : erm2 ] correspond to a model with @xmath156 and @xmath160 .",
    "this angular momentum loss reduces @xmath5 by a factor @xmath132 at all mass scales , bringing it in reasonable agreement with the observed value for haloes with @xmath161 .",
    "however , for lower ( higher ) mass haloes the model overpredicts ( underpredicts ) the value of @xmath5 compared to the empirically inferred values . increasing @xmath153 also modified the galaxy formation efficiency because it results in denser ( smaller ) discs . in low mass haloes ,",
    "the galaxies are gas rich . hence ,",
    "an increase in disc density results in higher star formation rates and consequently more energy to drive outflows .",
    "this more than compensates for the higher escape velocities , resulting in lower values of @xmath6 . in massive haloes , on the other hand , the galaxies are gas poor , so that an increase of the density of the disc only results in an increase of the escape velocity .",
    "this reduces the amount of ejected gas , and therefore increases @xmath6 .",
    "it is clear that none of the models discussed thus far can simultaneously reproduce the empirically inferred trends of @xmath6 and @xmath5 with halo mass . as an illustration of what seems to be required , we now consider a model in which both @xmath151 and @xmath153 depend on halo mass . the red filled symbols in fig .  [",
    "fig : erm3 ] show a model in which and have been tuned so that the model matches the empirical @xmath6 and @xmath5 .",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath151 and @xmath153 , as a function of virial mass , are shown in the upper right - hand panel .",

    "[ fig : erm4 ] shows the analogous results but for model  b ( an imf that results in stellar mass - to - light ratios that are 0.3 dex lower than for model a and with @xmath77 ) .",
    "reproducing the galaxy formation efficiencies now requires even stronger feedback , but with a similar mass dependence , whereas the fraction of angular momentum that is lost is similar to that of our fiducial model .",
    "thus far we have assumed that disc galaxies form in typical dark matter haloes .",
    "this must be true at the low mass end , simply because disc galaxies dominate the galaxy population at low masses .",
    "however , at high masses disc galaxies are a minority , so that it is possible that they form in a biased subset of dark matter haloes . to reconcile our models with the empirical fact that @xmath5 seems to be independent of halo mass requires a bias such that massive disc galaxies form preferentially in haloes with larger spin parameters .    such a bias",
    "is naturally achieved by invoking disc stability .",
    "disc galaxies can only survive as such to the present day if their discs are sufficiently stable .",
    "disc galaxies that are unstable redistribute their angular momentum via secular evolution , typically resulting in spheroid dominated galaxies ( e.g. , combes 1990 ; norman , sellwood & hasan 1996 ; van den bosch 1998 ; mao & mo 1998 ) . since more self - gravitating ( denser ) discs are more unstable ( e.g. , efstathiou , lake & negroponte 1982 ) , and since the surface density of a disc is proportional to @xmath166 ( e.g. , mo , mao & white 1998 ) , one expects a bias against disc galaxies in haloes with the lowest spin parameter .",
    "since the disc s surface density is also proportional to @xmath6 , and empirically @xmath6 increases with increasing halo mass , one expects discs in less massive haloes to be more stable than those in more massive haloes .",
    "hence , disc stability may introduce a bias against forming _ massive _ disc galaxies in _ low _ spin parameter haloes , exactly what seems to be required .    to test the potential impact of disc stability on the relations between @xmath6 , @xmath5 , and @xmath28 , we add a simple stability criterion to our models : we assume that if the disc contributes more than 84% of the mass within 2.2 disc scale lengths it will be highly unstable , and we remove these galaxies from our sample of model galaxies .",
    "we note that discs are already expected to become unstable  and hence to form bulges via secular evolution  at disc mass fractions lower than 84% .",
    "however , we choose a high stability threshold as we do not wish to remove the galaxies that remain disc dominated after secular evolution .",
    "[ fig : erm5 ] shows the effect of disc stability on @xmath6 and @xmath5 . in our fiducial model ( red long - dashed lines )",
    "the fraction of gas that cools at each time step ( @xmath167 ) depends on the metallicity of the hot halo gas ( here @xmath168 ) , the feedback efficiency ( here @xmath156 ) and the fraction of angular momentum that is lost ( here @xmath169 ) .",
    "this model approximately reproduces the observed relation between galaxy formation efficiency and halo mass , but it predicts that @xmath5 decreases strongly with increasing halo mass , which is inconsistent with the empirical results . invoking the disc stability criteria discussed above ( black dot - long - dashed lines ) results in a lower fraction of stable discs in higher mass haloes ( lower right panel ) : when computing the average @xmath5 at a given halo mass ( for both models and observations ) , we assume that the haloes have a median spin parameter as expected from cosmological simulations ( i.e. , @xmath170 ) . however , since stable discs have higher median spin parameters than unstable discs , this results in stable discs having higher @xmath5 .",
    "the stable discs in our model still have an anti - correlation between @xmath5 and halo mass , but the model is now consistent with the observations at the @xmath171 level .",
    "the disc stability scenario also provides a qualitative explanation for two additional observational facts : ( i ) the scatter in disc sizes decreases with increasing stellar mass ( shen 2003 ) , such that for the most massive discs the scatter is half that expected from the scatter in halo spin parameters ( dutton 2011a ) ; and ( ii ) the fraction of galaxies that are star forming disc galaxies declines with increasing galaxy and halo mass ( e.g. , yang 2008 ) .",
    "hence , we conclude that disc stability may be an important ingredient for understanding the empirical scaling relations between @xmath6 , @xmath5 and halo mass .",
    "the simplistic analytical models used above indicate that it is not easy to understand why the specific angular momentum ratio @xmath5 seems to be independent of halo mass , whereas the galaxy formation efficiency increases strongly with halo mass .",
    "in fact , reproducing the empirical scaling relations between @xmath6 , @xmath5 and halo mass seems to require a feedback efficiency that declines with increasing halo mass .",
    "an important downside of our simplistic models is that they do not properly account for the hydrodynamics of outflows from galaxies embedded in a large scale environment from which the galaxy is also accreting matter .",
    "this requires cosmological , hydrodynamical simulations , which arguably are the best tool available to model the complex , hierarchical nature of galaxy formation .",
    "recently , sales ( 2009 ) have presented a suite of high resolution , hydrodynamical simulations of the formation of galaxies in a @xmath16cdm concordance cosmology , with a wide range of feedback recipes .",
    "their resulting galaxies ( at @xmath172 ) have properties that are well fit by @xmath173.\\ ] ] independent of the feedback recipe ! here @xmath174 is the galaxy mass fraction . as a specific example , for a galaxy mass fraction of @xmath175 ( i.e. 20% of the cosmic baryon fraction ) the specific angular momentum ratio is predicted to be @xmath176 .",
    "this scaling is given by the black dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : er ] .",
    "interestingly , the relation from sales ( 2009 ) is very similar to the results from our simple cooling model ( red lines ) .",
    "this suggests that feedback in their simulations largely preserves the rank order in binding energy of the baryons , such that the relation between @xmath6 and @xmath5 of the resulting galaxies is predominantly set by the relative radial profiles of mass and angular momentum shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : jdmd ] .",
    "it is unclear at present why the simulations seem to preserve the rank order of binding energy , but it may have to do with the fact that outflows are inhibited from travelling far from their source due to pressure confinement of the surrounding gas , an effect that is not accounted for in our simplistic , analytical models .",
    "irrespective of what causes the relation between @xmath5 and @xmath6 in the simulations , it is clear that eq .",
    "[ eq : sales ] is inconsistent with the empirical relation .",
    "we caution , though , that the simulations were only run to redshift @xmath177 , whereas our empirical results correspond to @xmath178 .",
    "in addition , our empirical results are for star - forming disc - dominated galaxies , whereas the results from the simulations are for all types of galaxies .",
    "it remains to be seen whether simulations of disc formation that are run to @xmath179 yield a relation between @xmath5 and @xmath6 in better agreement with the data .",
    "we have combined measurements of halo virial masses from weak lensing and satellite kinematics with the tully - fisher and size - mass relations of disc galaxies ( i.e. , star - forming and disc - dominated ) to infer the average spin parameter of disc galaxies as a function of their halo mass . using toy models for disc galaxy formation",
    "we have discussed implications of these results for cooling , outflows and angular momentum loss .",
    "we summarize our results as follows :    * the average galaxy spin parameters of disc galaxies are consistent with being independent of halo mass for the range of halo masses probed here : @xmath180 . *",
    "the primary uncertainty in measuring the spin parameters of galaxies is the determination of halo masses .",
    "realistic uncertainties of 0.25 dex ( @xmath171 ) , result in uncertainties in galaxy spin parameters of a factor of 1.5 .",
    "a secondary uncertainty is the stellar imf .",
    "since gas discs have higher specific angular momentum than stellar discs , lower stellar mass normalizations will result in higher spin parameters .",
    "for example , stellar masses lower by 0.3 dex result in spin parameters higher by 0.12 dex . *",
    "the average spin parameter of galaxies , @xmath181 ( @xmath94 ) , is smaller than that of their host dark matter haloes , @xmath182 ( macci 2007 , 2008 ; bett 2007 ) .",
    "the inferred spin parameters of disc galaxies reveal no dependence on halo mass , so that the specific angular momentum ratio @xmath183 , independent of halo mass .",
    "the galaxy formation efficiency parameter , @xmath6 , however , reveals a strong mass dependence , increasing from @xmath184 for @xmath185 to @xmath186 for @xmath187 for our fiducial model . * since mass is more centrally concentrated than angular momentum in haloes a simple inside - out accretion model results in a strong correlation between galaxy spin parameter and galaxy formation efficiency , contrary to observations .",
    "this provides further support for the already popular notion than the low galaxy formation efficiencies in haloes of mass @xmath188 are determined primarily by feedback processes , and not by an inefficiency of cooling .",
    "* the empirically inferred relations between galaxy formation efficiency , @xmath6 , angular momentum ratio , @xmath5 , and halo mass seem to indicate that galaxy formation involves galactic outflows , or other mechanisms that can regulate the galaxy formation efficiency ( e.g. , supernova feedback , agn feedback , reionization , pre - heating ) , as well as mechanisms that cause a substantial transfer of angular momentum from the baryons to the dark matter ( e.g. , dynamical friction ) .",
    "although the need for feedback mechanisms to regulate the efficiency of galaxy formation has long been recognized , the observed scaling relations for disc galaxies seem to require that the often adopted supernovae feedback efficiency parameter , @xmath151 , decreases with halo mass . in addition , the angular momentum content of observed disc galaxies also require that angular momentum loss is more important for disc formation in less massive haloes . it remains to be seen whether realistic models for galaxy formation can achieve effective values for @xmath151 and @xmath153 that reveal such a dependence on halo mass",
    ".    what could be the cause for the _ effective _ values for @xmath151 and @xmath153 to decrease with increasing halo mass ?",
    "one possibility is that this mass dependence is a manifestation of the transition from cold - mode accretion at @xmath189 to hot - mode accretion for haloes with @xmath190 ( e.g. , birnboim & dekel 2003 ; keres 2005 , 2009 ; brooks 2009 ) . in the cold mode regime , outflows are unhindered by hot - gas atmospheres , which may result in higher effective feedback efficiencies . if , as envisioned in our models , the outflows preferentially remove low angular momentum material , the same outflows which reduce the galaxy formation efficiency are expected to increase the specific angular momentum ratio , @xmath5 .",
    "hence , in order to reproduce the inferred @xmath191 , the baryons that end up in the disc need to lose a significant fraction ( @xmath192 ) of their angular momentum during the galaxy formation process .",
    "if the cold accretion is sufficiently clumpy , this may come about because of dynamical friction .    in the hot mode accretion regime",
    ", outflows are expected to be less efficient , since they have to do work against their hot gaseous atmospheres . in this regime",
    ", one expects that the baryon fraction and angular momentum of the resulting disc galaxies are largely determined by the inside - out cooling of the hot gas , resulting in @xmath5 decreasing strongly with increasing halo mass .",
    "this , however , is inconsistent with the empirical result that @xmath5 appears to be independent of halo mass .",
    "we have argued that disc stability may play an important role here , effectively removing systems with low halo spin parameter from the sample of disc galaxies ( because they produce unstable discs ) , thereby increasing the average @xmath5 of massive disc galaxies . another important process may be that at high redshifts ( @xmath193 ) , massive haloes in the hot - mode accretion regime can still accrete a significant amount of material via cold streams that penetrate the hot halo ( e.g. , dekel 2009 ) . depending on the ` impact parameters ' of such streams , the cold material thus deposited to the central galaxy may have specific angular momentum that is relatively high , boosting the value of @xmath5 with respect to that expected in a simple cooling model .",
    "although plausible , we caution that the above discussion regarding the potential impact of the cold - mode to hot - mode accretion regime is highly speculative .",
    "in fact , the high resolution , hydrodynamical simulations of sales ( 2009 ) , which in principle should naturally account for the cold mode _ vs. _ hot mode effects mentioned above , did not yield ( disc ) galaxies with the correct relation between @xmath6 and @xmath5 . amazingly enough , their simulated galaxies revealed a tight , linear correlation between @xmath6 and @xmath5 in perfect agreement with our predictions for a simple cooling model , _ despite the fact that their simulations included star formation and feedback ( using several different implementations ) . _",
    "if taken at face value , these simulations seem to suggest that feedback has little to no effect on the @xmath6 _ vs. _ @xmath5 relation ; although it reduces @xmath6 , it causes a similar suppression of @xmath5 .",
    "in addition , the sales simulations ( which were only run to @xmath172 ) seem to indicate that cold mode accretion , which should have been the dominant mode of accretion for the galaxies in their simulations , does not have the effect envisioned above .",
    "more detailed hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation ( run all the way to @xmath179 ) are needed to investigate these issues in more detail .",
