    "the theory of image charges over a perfect metal surface has an early history that dates back to lord kelvin in 1848 @xcite .",
    "it is a subject covered in most textbooks on electrostatics @xcite,@xcite , as well as an important topic in modern research @xcite , @xcite .",
    "hence it is of considerable importance in the undergraduate curriculum . in a recent article in this journal , roulet and saint jeans ( rsj ) @xcite discussed the corrections beyond the classical kelvin theory by considering the effect due to a finite electron screening length @xmath0 in the metal .",
    "this topic has indeed hardly been addressed in any textbooks , except for more advanced texts such as mahan @xcite , but only in the more general theory of electron screening and response functions . a simplified consideration based on chemical equilibrium such as employed by rsj @xcite",
    "should deepen the understanding of classical kelvin image theory as well as stimulate advanced students to consider the more comprehensive treatment based on many - body theory and linear response @xcite .",
    "unfortunately the otherwise excellent exposition of rsj @xcite is plagued by an improper choice of boundary conditions , and by their inability to obtain a complete solution for the potential in the metal dictated by a helmholtz type partial differential equation ( pde ) , which as we shall see is in fact separable , see appendix i and ii .",
    "they resorted to a perturbative solution that is not valid for large screening lengths - which is in fact a trivial limit . in this paper",
    "we shall rectify this and consequently provide the complete solution for the potentials both _ inside _ and _ outside _ the metal surface . naturally our results , being exact will recover the expected classical theory both in the case of small screening length ( @xmath2 ) , as treated by rsj @xcite , and the opposite case of large screening length ( @xmath3 ) , when the metal becomes ineffective and the classical laplace potential ensues .",
    "this paper is divided into four sections . in section",
    "i we shall review the classical kelvin image theory , solved by the separation of the laplace equation in cylindrical co - ordinates .",
    "this detail solution is nowadays not commonly taught in the undergraduate curriculum @xcite . in section",
    "ii we shall demonstrate that by using the same technique , the helmholtz equation ( eq.(22 ) of ref @xcite ) , for the screened potential inside the metal can also be solved .",
    "more importantly we shall discuss the proper boundary conditions for this problem .",
    "the standard conditions follow from the maxwell equations @xcite : ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) on the surface edge ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "however rsj imposed an artificial condition based on a _ strict _ compliance of the _ final _ surface charge density ( here denoted as @xmath7 ) with the limiting classical surface charge density ( here denoted as @xmath8 ) .",
    "here we shall argue that the limiting surface charge density @xmath8 should only be a consequence of the complete theory and not a precondition . as a result @xmath7",
    "should be @xmath0 dependent , while @xmath8 is manifestly not .",
    "the rsj choice of boundary condition , as it will be shown is also amenable to a closed form solution ( see appendix ii ) , hence their perturbative approach is unnecessary .",
    "it is interesting to note ( see appendix ii ) that the exact solution to their problem in fact diverges as @xmath9 for large @xmath0 ( see appendix ii ) and thus the perturbation method is inoperable in principle , as it can never converge to the exact solution .",
    "we believe this essentially non - perturbative feature is an artifact of their boundary condition which is unlike the solutions presented here .",
    "moreover , although the departures between our theory and theirs only become apparent at @xmath10 for small @xmath0 , their theory further leaves the outside potentials undetermined and will require additional assumptions to complete . we shall show that our solution to the problem is complete and can be expressed in terms of integrals involving bessel functions of the type similar to and much studied in electromagnetic propagation @xcite,@xcite , beginning with sommerfeld s classic work of 1909 @xcite . in section iii shall present the exact solutions and in section iv we shall discuss the effects on and hence corrections to the classical image potentials outside the metal surface , which were omitted by rsj @xcite . here",
    "we shall also obtain the corrections to the surface charge density as discussed above .",
    "this correction integrates to zero charge as we shall see ( appendix iii ) . in section v we shall replace the metal in our theory by a dielectric with @xmath11 .",
    "the reader may like to note that all the results of this paper are not new .",
    "they have in fact been derived before ( unknown to the author ) by newns @xcite and more recently by krmar et al @xcite ( see the end notes ) . as a result of our investigations , the conclusions reached by rsj for the case of large @xmath12 as in a semiconductor",
    "is subtle as naively the limit @xmath13 in fact approaches the classical results as required for a dielectric .",
    "a more careful comparison will require investigating the case @xmath14 under the condition that @xmath15 which is indeed a non - trivial limit in our theory .",
    "more detailed numerical calculations can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "we shall conclude with a brief discussion of time - dependent effects , such as the case of an oscillating charge , by which ingenious experiments based on the classical skin effect could be used to test our predictions .",
    "these experiments could be designed and possibly be inspiring to an undergraduate class .",
    "in this section we shall adopt the more common convention in which the physical charge @xmath16 is introduced above the metal surface at @xmath17 and where the rest of the metal is defined for @xmath18 , see fig 1 .",
    "this is opposite to the case of rsj but is similar to most textbooks such as jackson @xcite and landau et al @xcite .",
    "it is well known that kelvin image theory provides the solution for the potential outside the metal as : @xmath19 the second term is the so called image potential due to the fictitious charge @xmath20 whose addition enables the boundary condition @xmath21 to be satisfied , see fig 1 .",
    "this is a dirichlet boundary value problem whose solution eq([eqn1 ] ) is justified heuristically in most texts , see for example @xcite .",
    "it is perhaps useful in a later undergraduate course to actually verify that eq([eqn1 ] ) is indeed a solution of the laplace equation .",
    "this can be demonstrated in the following way .",
    "the laplace equation in cylindrical coordinates with azimuthal symmetry : @xmath22 has solutions that are given in terms of bessel functions @xcite , @xcite : @xmath23 the coefficients of these expansions namely @xmath24 and @xmath25 are to be determined by appropriate boundary conditions as we shall see .",
    "note that the second expansion has been chosen with the @xmath26 function in order to satisfy the required boundary condition on the metal surface @xmath6 .",
    "we have two coefficients and thus we need two more boundary conditions to determine the solutions . as is well known from most texts @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , for electrostatics , these are derived from the two maxwell equations : @xmath27 which upon integrating around an infinitesimal surface volume imply the continuity of the potential , say at @xmath28 : @xmath29 and the discontinuity of the slope : @xmath30 where the charge density @xmath31 consists only of the _ true _ charge and does not include any induced charges . the delta function in eq.([eqn6 ] )",
    "is normalized for : @xmath32 now the continuity condition eq .",
    "( [ eqn5 ] ) leads to : @xmath33 while the discontinuity condition eq .",
    "( [ eqn6 ] ) , with the use of the orthogonality property of the bessel functions @xcite : @xmath34 leads to : @xmath35 the straightforward solution of the simultaneous eq.([eqn8 ] ) and eq.([eqn10 ] ) leads to : @xmath36 that these solutions lead to the classical kelvin image potential eq.([eqn1 ] ) follows readily from another student exercise in the form of a mathematical identity for bessel functions @xcite : @xmath37 notice that the final solution depends on the boundary conditions _ both _ at @xmath28 and at @xmath6 , and not just on the latter alone as the heuristic argument @xcite seems to suggest . finally to conclude this section",
    "we shall derive the classical _ induced _ surface charge density @xmath8 .",
    "this is simply obtained from the required boundary condition @xcite , @xcite : @xmath38 a result easily derived using eq.([eqn12 ] ) .",
    "we remind the reader that this boundary condition is obtained from an infinitesimal small surface volume integral of the maxwell equation : @xmath39 in the same way as eq([eqn6 ] ) where the total charge density @xmath40 contains _ all _ charges , true and induced @xcite . in the section iv , as with rsj @xcite , we shall derive this surface charge density by integrating the bulk interior charge density @xmath41 as we shall see .",
    "the ( thomas - fermi ) screening theory modifications for the potential inside the metal @xmath42 is given by the helmholtz equation @xcite : @xmath43 where the screening length @xmath0 is given by : @xmath44 this is expressed in terms of a thermodynamic derivative of the chemical potential with respect to the density .",
    "we note that this theory for @xmath0 given by eqn([helmholtz ] ) is in fact quite general , it should also be valid in the case of a dielectric or a liquid surface , upon replacing @xmath0 by the appropriate debye - hckel screening length .",
    "significant modifications to the thomas - fermi theory will come about only when @xmath0 becomes comparable to the fermi wavelength @xmath45 which we shall briefly mention in the conclusion . in appendix",
    "i , we shall show that the solution of the helmholtz equation eq.([helmholtz ] ) is also expressed in terms of bessel functions .",
    "hence the complete solution of boundary value problem specified by eq.([eqn2 ] ) and eq.([helmholtz ] ) is now given by : @xmath46 where @xmath47 , see appendix i. note that the non - vanishing of the potential on the surface @xmath48 for general @xmath0 requires that we construct solutions for @xmath49 that contains two ( in general ) unequal coefficients @xmath50 and @xmath51 . we have already discussed the boundary conditions at @xmath28 . the continuity condition eq.([eqn5 ] ) leads to : @xmath52 while the discontinuity condition eq.([eqn6 ] ) leads to : @xmath53 two more boundary conditions are required to obtain the solution .",
    "these are in fact obtained in the same way as eq.([eqn5 ] ) and eq.([eqn6 ] ) , only that now we have continuity of the potentials and their slopes on the surface @xmath6 in the absence of true charges on the surface .",
    "thus from : @xmath54 we obtain : @xmath55 and from : @xmath56 we obtain : @xmath57 the problem is now completely specified by equations : ( [ cont1]),([cont2]),([gsol1 ] ) and ( [ gsol2 ] ) .",
    "a simultaneous solution of these equations leads to a complete solution for all the potentials , hence : @xmath58 e^{-kz}j_0(kr ) dk \\qquad { \\rm for } \\qquad z > h , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\phi_<(r , z ) & = & { q\\over 2\\pi\\epsilon_0 } \\int_0^\\infty \\bigl [ { k cosh(kz)+\\beta_k sinh(kz ) \\over k+\\beta_k } \\bigr ] e^{-kh }   j_0(kr ) dk \\qquad { \\rm for } \\qquad 0\\le z\\le h \\qquad { \\rm and } ,   \\nonumber \\\\ \\phi_{in}(r , z ) & = & { q\\over 2\\pi\\epsilon_0 } \\int_0^\\infty { k e^{\\beta_k z } \\over k+\\beta_k } e^{-kh } j_0(k r ) dk \\qquad { \\rm for } \\qquad z<0 ; \\label{all potentials1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the appendix ii , we shall present in the same way the exact solution for the rsj problem which consist of eq.([helmholtz ] ) only and the boundary condition that @xmath59 , which however leaves the outside potentials unspecified .",
    "naturally it would be meaningful to compare these potentials with the classical image potentials in eq.([eqn3 ] ) and eq.([eqn11 ] ) . to do this each coefficient in eq.([all potentials1 ] ) is rationalized by multiplying with @xmath60 and after some simple algebra , we have : @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the classical potentials given in section ii .",
    "the screening corrections are given in terms of the @xmath0 dependent potential : @xmath64 we can easily derive that for small @xmath0 : @xmath65^{3/2 } } .",
    "\\label{limit1}\\ ] ] for large @xmath0 we use an expansion of the square root:@xmath66 to obtain : @xmath67 which cancels the image potential in eq.([eqn1 ] ) as required .",
    "using the same manipulations we obtain the inside potential as : @xmath68 from which the bulk charge density : @xmath69 is obtained .",
    "in particular we have the limit : @xmath70^{3/2}}e^{z/\\lambda } \\qquad ( z<0 ) , \\label{phillimit}\\ ] ] in agreement with rsj @xcite .",
    "however it is easy to show that the higher order terms differ , see appendix ii .",
    "moreover unlike rsj , we have no difficulty with the limit of large @xmath0 which again by an expansion of the square root leads to : @xmath71 which is of course the correct laplace potential for the case when the metal is ineffective , since the helmholtz equation eq([helmholtz ] ) now reduces to the laplace equation . as promised in section i , we shall evaluate the surface charge density : @xmath72 where @xmath73 which is the new term in our theory .",
    "this quantity integrates to zero charge , ( see appendix iii ) , thus the total charge remains @xmath20 as before .",
    "hence the form @xmath74 is not the only ( unique ) surface charge density that integrates to a total charge of @xmath20 .",
    "we note that while the limit @xmath13 appears straightforward , this is deceptive .",
    "attempts to calculate the next order i.e. @xmath75 corrections lead to divergent integrals that require careful treatment . we shall not discuss this exercise here . suffice to say the corrections to the classical potentials due to @xmath76 and @xmath42 are to smear the image charge from a point charge to a charge distribution whose weight vanishes as @xmath0 increases .",
    "this charge distribution can be derived from the results presented here and has been worked out by newns @xcite in terms of an order two bessel function .",
    "the extension of our theory to a semiconductor surface , in which @xmath0 is finite , is now rather straightforward .",
    "the only significant modification is that the boundary condition eq.([cont4 ] ) is now replaced by : @xmath77 where @xmath11 is the dielectric constant of the material .",
    "we need not repeat the details here and present merely the solution for @xmath42 which now takes the form : @xmath78 where @xmath79 .",
    "the integral can be analyzed in both limits as usual . for small @xmath0",
    "we have : @xmath80^{3/2}}e^{z/\\lambda } \\qquad ( z<0 ) , \\label{phildlimit}\\ ] ] which is analogous with the metallic case . for large @xmath0",
    "however : @xmath81 which is the classical result . recall that the potential inside a dielectric is equivalent to an image charge @xmath82 given by @xcite : @xmath83 replacing the real charge @xmath16 at the point @xmath84 outside the surface .",
    "hence for large @xmath85 , classical theory is recovered and as a matter of fact it is for @xmath86 , as shown in eq.([phildlimit ] ) that screening creates departures from classical theory .",
    "thus for dielectrics it is the case of small and finite @xmath0 that leads to corrections to the kelvin theory .",
    "finally we shall briefly mention the case of an oscillating charge .",
    "the results here being static will lead to a zero frequency contribution to the classical finite frequency skin effect . the propagation of electromagnetic waves in the substrate will now be dictated by a complex wave vector @xcite : @xmath87 to which we have added the screening length @xmath0 . at low frequencies , @xcite , the skin depth @xmath88 which varies as the inverse square root of the frequency dominates .",
    "hence by extrapolating skin depth measurements to zero frequency , the results presented in this paper may be detectable @xcite .",
    "this could be a novel undergraduate experiment for physics and engineeering classes .",
    "in conclusion we have presented an exact solution for the corrections to the classical kelvin image theory of electrostatics previously discussed by rsj @xcite in this journal . some inadequacies in their analyses",
    "are rectified and a complete solution for all the potentials are obtained in closed form .",
    "we found that some care needs to be exercised with regard to statements about non - classical behaviour which are only valid in the case of _ finite _ @xmath0 , whereas for small and large @xmath0 we have shown that the theory reduce to the standard textbook analysis .",
    "nevertheless our theory shows that the non - vanishing potentials @xmath76 and @xmath42 , for any finite @xmath89 in the case when the charge is right on the metal surface i.e. for @xmath90 as opposed to the classical theory , have an essential role for surface chemistry that should be noted in all textbooks @xcite .      after this work",
    "was completed we were grateful to be advised by gabriel barton and bernard roulet that the results of our paper , with the exception of the proofs in the appendices , have in fact been derived some thirty years ago by dennis newns @xcite apart from minor differences in our definition of the induced potentials . also unknown to the author ,",
    "the results have also been rederived recently by krmar et al @xcite .",
    "the results of this paper are in agreement with newns and krmar et al the reader might be interested to know that the latter authors have also considered the case when the charge q becomes immersed _ inside _ the material , using extensions of the methods presented here .",
    "neither newns , krmar et al , nor the present author have considered the limit when @xmath45 becomes significant .",
    "the author is further indebted to marshall stoneham for pointing out that the solution in the limit of large @xmath91 has been considered by john willis @xcite , _ only within a static charge approximation_. this identified the significance of fermi surface effects ( omitted in this work ) which lead to friedel type oscillations in the density near the surface .",
    "no doubt a more sophisticated theory such as one using a density functional approach will be needed to treat all the various issues .",
    "the helmholtz equation eq.([helmholtz ] ) in azimuth symmetric cylindrical coordinates can be easily separated @xcite by the ansatz @xmath92 , such that : @xmath93 which has solutions : @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the separation constant . note that we have @xmath96 so that the other solution @xmath97 is exponentially increasing and can not be admitted by the boundary condition for @xmath98 .",
    "the radial equation now takes the form : @xmath99 where : @xmath100 . for @xmath101",
    "this is the differential equation for bessel functions of order zero . for @xmath102",
    "the solution goes as @xmath103 which is inadmissible as is the case where @xmath104 since bessel functions of imaginary arguments namely @xmath105 and @xmath106 are also inadmissible .",
    "thus the general solution of eq.([helmholtz ] ) is a superposition of solutions using an expansion coefficient @xmath107 given by : @xmath108 by a straightforward change of variable @xmath109 we easily obtain the solution given by the last of eqn.([laplacehelmholtz ] ) .",
    "the solution for the rsj boundary value problem can be obtained using the results of appendix i. the rsj potential and hence the bulk charge density is given by : @xmath110 the rsj boundary condition requires that the integral : @xmath111 hence we obtain : @xmath112 note that while this determines the inside potential in closed form : @xmath113 it leaves the outside potentials undetermined since eq.([cont1 ] ) and eq.([cont2 ] ) now become two equations with _ three _ unknowns . moreover eq.([rsjsoln4 ] ) is now divergent as @xmath9 for @xmath13 and does not reduce to the classical laplace potential as required .",
    "it is interesting to compare eq.([rsjsoln4 ] ) with eq.([qpotential ] ) .",
    "the former is essentially non - perturbative whereas the latter may be obtainable perturbatively if some care is exercised in treating the asymptotic integrals , see the remarks at the end of section iv .",
    "it is unclear and it would be interesting to speculate if this feature of the rsj solution has experimental significance such as when the total surface charge can be maintained constant , i.e. @xmath114 . in this case , following the eq.([rsjsoln2 ] ) , we can show that the potential now goes as @xmath115 .",
    "nevertheless it is interesting to compare the small @xmath0 expansion for the two solutions .",
    "we note that the difference between eq.([rsjsoln4])and eq.([insidepotential ] ) is a negative term : @xmath116 for small @xmath0 we change variable to @xmath117 and carry out the expansions for the square root and exponential terms via : @xmath118 @xmath119 inserting these into the integrands and evaluating the integrals we have the limiting expressions to @xmath120 as : @xmath121 , \\label{rsjasymt}\\ ] ] in agreement with rsj @xcite while our solution has the expansion : @xmath122 , \\label{choyasymt}\\ ] ] which differs from the latter at @xmath120 with an additional term .",
    "the proof is straightforward and it makes use of a simple trick involving a well known property of the bessel functions .",
    "we need to obtain , denoting @xmath124 by @xmath125 , the integral : @xmath126 which follows from the property that @xmath127 . making use of the orthogonality property eq.([eqn9 ] ) we now have : @xmath128 respectively . although @xmath129 is a discontinuous function at @xmath130 , the interchange of the limit with the integrals , while not rigorous , may be justified by the convergence of the integrals in eq.([choytrick1 ] ) for all @xmath131 @xcite .",
