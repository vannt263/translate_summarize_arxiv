    "the formation of molecules in the interstellar medium ( ism ) can proceed through several kinds of reactions .",
    "surface reactions on nano- to micrometer sized particles are thought to play a key role in the formation of molecules in the ism @xcite .",
    "dust grains in the ism consist of a core of silicates and carbonaceous components and , in dense clouds , these dust particles can be covered by icy mantles .",
    "the icy mantles contain mainly h@xmath0o , but also traces of other molecules ( e.g. , co , co@xmath0 , nh@xmath2ch@xmath3 , among others ) @xcite .",
    "observed infrared ( ir ) spectra reveal that h@xmath0o and co are the most abundant molecules in the icy mantles in the ism @xcite .",
    "recent ground and space based observations have also detected heavy water ( d@xmath0o ) in the ism @xcite .",
    "ultraviolet ( uv ) irradiation of an icy grain can photodissociate water molecules and cause desorption of the ice .",
    "the flux of uv photons in the ism is low @xcite compared with the lamp uv photon flux used in the laboratories ( which varies between , e.g. , ( 1.15.5)@xmath410@xmath5 photons @xmath6s@xmath7 @xcite ) , with photon fluxes of the order of 10@xmath8 photons @xmath6s@xmath7 , which is equivalent to roughly one incident photon per month per grain .",
    "the photodissociation dynamics is typically computed over a picosecond time scale , and hence , the photodissociation by one incident photon is completed before the next photon arrives at the ice .",
    "the energies of the incident photons @xmath9613  ev @xcite cover the first absorption bands of water ice .",
    "photodissociation and photodesorption of water in ice are of interest to understand astronomical observations of gas - phase water in cold clouds @xcite , and also because the photoproducts ( h and oh ) can proceed to react with co - adsorbed species , which may lead to the formation of more complex molecules @xcite .",
    "in addition , the process is interesting from a fundamental chemical physics point of view .",
    "most studies of photodissociation processes of molecules on surfaces have focused on ( sub)monolayers of species on mostly metallic surfaces , not on the thick ( @xmath9100 monolayer ( ml ) ) ices found in interstellar space .",
    "very different processes can occur in this case .",
    "several experiments on uv irradiation of amorphous and crystalline h@xmath0o ice @xcite and d@xmath0o ice @xcite have been carried out using different analysis techniques and different light sources .    in order to obtain insight into the basic molecular processes , the photodissociation of h@xmath0o molecules in amorphous and crystalline ice in the temperature range 1090  k has been studied using molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations @xcite .",
    "the most important photodesorption mechanism after photodissociation of water in the top three mls of the ice surface is h atom photodesorption , followed by oh radical photodesorption , and h@xmath0o molecule photodesorption .",
    "the calculated h@xmath0o photodesorption probability is due to two mechanisms .",
    "( 1 ) the direct mechanism : h and oh recombine after h@xmath0o photodissociation to form h@xmath0o , which eventually desorbs . ( 2 )",
    "the kick - out mechanism @xcite : an energetic h atom released after photodissociation kicks out one of the surrounding water molecules by a transfer of momentum .",
    "many key experiments studying water ice photodesorption have been performed for d@xmath0o rather than h@xmath0o .",
    "in contrast , the md simulations have so far been carried out only for h@xmath0o . in order to better compare with experiments and",
    "to identify isotope effects on the photodesorption processes , we present here results of md simulations of the uv photodissociation of amorphous d@xmath0o ice at different temperatures .    in sec .  [",

    "[ sec : conclusions ] the concluding remarks are given .",
    "the total analytical potential energy surface ( pes ) for the ice in the photodissociation calculations is the same as in our previous studies and can be written as follows :    @xmath10     + the first term describes the intermolecular interactions between the h@xmath0o molecules inside the ice excluding the h@xmath0o molecule that is photoexcited .",
    "these interactions are described by the tip4p potential @xcite with all molecules kept rigid .",
    "the second term refers to the intermolecular interactions of the photoexcited molecule , which is treated as fully flexible , with the rigid ice molecules and the third term is the intramolecular potential of the photoexcited molecule .",
    "these potential terms also cover all interactions involved in the dissociation and possible recombination of the excited molecule .",
    "the potentials are exactly the same as previously used for photodissociation of h@xmath0o ice .",
    "all details of the potentials and the functions used to switch between different potentials are given in ref .",
    "@xcite .      to study the uv photodissociation of d@xmath0o ice , we simply changed the mass of the h atom to that of the d atom .",
    "( of course , all the interactions that take place in and on the ice during the photodissociation are described with the same potentials employed for the uv photodissociation of h@xmath0o ice ( eq .  [ eq1 ] ) ) .",
    "crystalline and amorphous d@xmath0o ice surfaces were constructed using the md method @xcite , and using the same procedure and cell parameters employed before to model h@xmath0o ice @xcite .",
    "starting from the normal hexagonal ice ( i@xmath11 ) crystalline ice configuration ( containing 8 bilayers ( bls ) ( 16  mls ) with 60 ( 30 ) molecules in each ml ) , the amorphous ice surface was set up at 10 , 20 , 60 , or 90  k using the ` fast quenching ' method @xcite .",
    "further details can be found in our previous studies @xcite . since the resulting amorphous ice surface has a more irregular bonding structure than the crystalline ice surface @xcite assigning molecules to mls is not straightforward @xcite . in our most recent sudy",
    "@xcite a new definition of ml ( binning method 2 ) was tested and shown to be a more realistic way to assign molecules to mls .",
    "this binning ( method 2 ) is used in this study and it consists of choosing a molecule and finding the first 23 closest molecules in terms of ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) coordinates .",
    "this leads to 24 molecules that are divided in 12 bins of two molecules each , based on their @xmath14 center of mass coordinates .",
    "the 12 bins represent the top 12  mls of the ice in which the molecules are allowed to move .      for each of the top four mls",
    ", all the molecules were chosen to be photodissociated and for each molecule 200 different initial configurations were considered . to initialize the trajectories @xcite",
    ", a wigner phase - space distribution function @xcite fitted to the ground - state vibrational wavefunction of gas - phase water is used . in the case of heavy water the trajectories",
    "are initialized by using the corresponding wigner distribution of gas - phase heavy water , which has the same functional form as for gas - phase water ( eq .  5.13 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , but with @xmath15 = @xmath16 @xmath17 ( eq.5.16 in ref .",
    "the initial coordinates and momenta of the atoms from the dissociating molecule are sampled using a monte carlo procedure .",
    "then , a franck - condon excitation is performed and the system is put on the first electronically excited state , on the dk @xmath18 pes @xcite .",
    "the excitation energies are calculated by computing the energy difference between a d@xmath0o ice with an excited molecule and one with a ground state d@xmath0o molecule ( both molecules with the same coordinates ) .",
    "the calculated d@xmath0o amorphous ice spectrum is shifted 0.02  ev with respect to that for h@xmath0o amorphous ice @xcite .    to simulate the dynamics of a photodissociation event , newtons s equations of motion are integrated in time with a time step of 0.02  fs and a maximum time of 20  ps .",
    "the stop criterion and the six final outcomes after uv photodissociation of d@xmath0o are analogous to those described previously for h@xmath0o photodissociation @xcite : ( 1 ) desorption of d while od is trapped inside or on the ice , ( 2 ) desorption of od while d is trapped inside or on the ice , ( 3 ) desorption of both d and od , ( 4 ) d and od are both trapped inside or on the ice , ( 5 ) d and od recombine and form a d@xmath0o molecule which either desorbs or ( 6 ) is trapped inside or on the ice . besides these six outcomes ,",
    "an additional channel is possible where d@xmath0o desorbs through the so - called ` kick - out ' mechanism @xcite .",
    "this occurs when a molecule desorbs from the ice by momentum transfer from an energetic d atom resulting from photodissociation of a neighbouring photoexcited molecule .",
    "we calculate the probabilities @xmath19 of the outcomes per absorbed uv photon in a specific ml @xmath20 and its standard errors ( @xmath21=@xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the total number of trajectories simulated in ml  @xmath20 ) at all ice temperatures for the top four mls ( the error bars in the figures and tables correspond to 66@xmath24 confidence intervals ) .",
    "however , not all of the uv photons that arrive at the ice are absorbed in these monolayers .",
    "andersson @xmath25 @xcite estimated the absorption probability per ml ( @xmath26 ) to be about 7@xmath410@xmath27 using an absorption cross section of about 6@xmath410@xmath28@xmath6 ( for more details we refer to the appendix  a in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the case of",
    "heavy water amorphous ice we have assumed the same @xmath26 . the total photodesorption yield ( @xmath29 )",
    "can be calculated from the calculated photodesorption probabilities per absorbed uv photon in a specific ml @xmath20 , by multiplying this probability @xmath30 with the probability that the photon makes it to ml  @xmath20 and the probability that the photon is absorbed in a given ml ( @xmath26 ) , and summing the resulting yields per ml over the considered mls .",
    "this is summarized in the following equation @xcite :    @xmath31     +",
    "the probabilities of all the different outcomes following photoexcitation of one molecule in the ice have been calculated , but we only report those concerning photodesorption ( i.e. , outcomes 1 , 2 , 3 , and 5 ) and for the top 4  mls because , according to previous md simulations at different ice temperatures @xcite , the photodesorption mainly takes place after photoexcitation in these monolayers .",
    "thus , the outcome probabilities strongly depend on the monolayer in which the photoexcited molecule is initially located : the photoexcitation in the top mls leads mainly to photodesorption , while deeper into the ice it leads to trapping @xcite .    the average d atom photodesorption probability and the average h atom photodesorption probability @xcite taken over the top four monolayers ( e.g. , @xmath32@xmath33@xmath34=@xmath35/4 ) are plotted in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] .",
    "the average h photodesorption probability is somewhat larger than that of d , by about 6  @xmath24 for all @xmath36 studied .",
    "the total deuterium ( hydrogen ) atom photodesorption probability is calculated by summing over two different processes : one in which the d ( h ) atom desorbs while the od ( oh ) stays trapped in the surface , and one in which both photofragments desorb from the ice surface ( outcomes 1 and 3 ) .",
    "the deuterium and hydrogen atom photodesorption probabilities are higher than the od ( oh ) and d@xmath0o ( h@xmath0o ) photodesorption probabilities in the uppermost monolayers of the d@xmath0o ( h@xmath0o ) amorphous ice ( see fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] where the h and d photodesorption probabilities are displayed versus ice temperature and ml ) .",
    "this is because d and h atoms are smaller and are formed with higher kinetic energies immediately after d@xmath0o and h@xmath0o photodissociation , which facilitates the desorption of these atoms @xcite .",
    "the average photodesorption probability of d is smaller than that of h mostly because the probabilities of d atom photodesorption in the third and fourth monolayers ( fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] ) are smaller than those for the h atom .",
    "this trend is expected because d is heavier than h. therefore , the efficiency of energy transfer between d and d@xmath0o molecules is larger than the corresponding efficiency between h and h@xmath0o molecules .",
    "if the photoexcited molecule is isolated ( i.e. , in the absence of the surrounding ice ) , the initial kinetic energy in which d and h atoms are formed after d@xmath0o and h@xmath0o photodissociation should be similar in order to achieve energy conservation .",
    "but , in the presence of ice , d atoms lose more kinetic energy than h atoms when they interact with the surrounding molecules due to the larger efficiency of energy transfer , and they are therefore less able to penetrate the ice when moving through the upper layers .",
    "the dependence on ice temperature is negligible . the average d atom photodesorption probability ( fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] ) is almost constant at @xmath954  @xmath24 .",
    "however , this probability depends on the ml where the photoexcited molecule was initially located ( fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] ) . in the top two mls",
    "the probability is high ( @xmath990  @xmath24 to @xmath970  @xmath24 ) , but it drops in the third ml and further below , because other processes such as trapping are in competition . trapping becomes important because deeper in the ice the structure is more closed and the molecules from the ice above can impede the d atom from reaching the ice surface .",
    "d atoms travel through the d@xmath0o ice at 90  k by an average distance of 8.4    before they become trapped , whereas h atoms travel around 9.1   .",
    "the od and oh radicals travel 2.2    and 1.9   , respectively .",
    "the recombined d@xmath0o and h@xmath0o move on average a distance of 1.8    and 2.0   , respectively .",
    "therefore , the mobility of the photofragments inside the ice is slightly affected by the mass of the photofragments : h atoms move further than d atoms until they become trapped , because h is lighter than d. the maximum distances travelled , which are about tens of angstroms should enable reaction with other species trapped in the ice .",
    "this could explain the formation of more complex molecules in the ism .",
    "the second main photodesorption mechanism in the uppermost mls of the ice is od photodesorption .",
    "[ figure3 ] shows that the average of the od photodesorption probabilities taken over the top 4  mls is larger than that for oh for all ice temperatures studied . to calculate the od ( oh ) photodesorption probabilities we have summed over the probabilities of two pathways : the probability of the channel in which the od ( oh ) radical desorbs while the d ( h ) atom remains trapped in the ice surface , and the probability of the channel in which both photofragments leave the ice surface ( outcome 2 and 3 , respectively ) .",
    "the probabilities per monolayer are plotted in fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] versus ice temperature .",
    "those for od are much larger than those for oh @xcite in the top two monolayers , which gives rise to a larger total average od photodesorption probability ( fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] ) . in the absence of the surrounding ice , the water fragments ( d and od , h and oh ) have to obey momentum conservation ( @xmath37=@xmath38 , @xmath39=h ,",
    "d ) and energy conservation ( @xmath40+@xmath41=@xmath42=@xmath43 , @xmath43 being the initial available energy @xmath44@xmath45@xmath46 , @xmath39=h , d ; the excitation energy @xmath44 is in the range 7.59.5  ev with a peak at 8.6  ev , and the dissociation energy @xmath46",
    "@xmath47  5.4  ev @xcite ) , leading to the following equation :    @xmath48     + thus , if the molecule is isolated and dissociates , the od radicals will be formed with higher initial translational energy than the oh radicals ( e@xmath49=@xmath43/10 and e@xmath50=@xmath43/18 , which leads to @xmath51 @xmath47 1.8@xmath52 ) according to eq .",
    "because the od radicals have a higher initial translational energy than the oh radicals in the uppermost monolayers , they leave the ice surface more easily .",
    "the od photodesorption probability decreases with increasing depth , similar to the oh photodesorption probability @xcite . in the third and fourth mls , the od and oh photodesorption probabilities drop to less than 1@xmath410@xmath53 because the od and oh radicals do not have enough translational energy to escape from the ice surface .",
    "an oscillatory effect is observed when the od and oh photodesorption probabilities are plotted in mls 14 versus ice temperature ( fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] ) .",
    "we attributed these oscillations in our previous paper @xcite to the irregular nature of the amorphous ice surface , which makes it very complicated to assign molecules to specific mls , and also to the finite sample size of about 30 molecules per ml .",
    "the average od and oh photodesorption probabilities increase with ice temperature by @xmath924  @xmath24 and @xmath925  @xmath24 , respectively , from 10 to 90  k. if longer time scales in our simulations could be considered , a stronger dependence on ice temperature would be expected , because processes like thermal diffusion and thermal desorption are more efficient at higher @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "the third photodesorption channel upon uv photodissociation of d@xmath0o amorphous ice is d@xmath0o molecule photodesorption .",
    "this is due to two mechanisms : the direct and the kick - out mechanism .",
    "the direct mechanism consists of the recombination of the d atom and od radical that leads to the formation of an energetic d@xmath0o molecule that eventually desorbs ( outcome 5 ) .",
    "in this situation the d@xmath0o molecule has a high probability of desorbing from the ice in a vibrationally excited state @xcite .",
    "the kick - out mechanism takes place after the photodissociation of a d@xmath0o molecule when an energetic d atom transfers momentum to one of the surrounding d@xmath0o molecules , which is then likely to desorb vibrationally cold @xcite .",
    "since in our model we can not quantify the energy transfer from x to internal modes of x@xmath0o , because the kicked out molecule is treated as internally rigid , we have carried out quasi - classical trajectory calculations on the isolated x  x@xmath0o system at different incident x atom kinetic energies ( x = h , d ) .",
    "here we only report the results for @xmath40=1.5  ev , because it is the average kinetic energy with which h and d atoms kick a surrounding molecule out of the ice at @xmath36=10  k. further details on these calculations will be reported in the paper we are preparing @xcite .",
    "gas phase collisions at @xmath40=1.5  ev lead to final average vibrational energies of @xmath90.16  ev for h@xmath0o , and @xmath90.77  ev for d@xmath0o , whereas in the ice system recombined h@xmath0o and d@xmath0o molecules desorb from the ice surface with average ro - vibrational energies of 5.3 and 5.4  ev , respectively .",
    "thus , the kicked out molecules are much more likely to be formed in states with lower vibrational energies than the molecules formed after recombination of the photofragments .",
    "yabushita @xmath1 @xcite , and hama @xmath1 @xcite observed photodesorbed x@xmath0o in the ground vibrational state by using resonance - enhanced multiphoton ionization ( rempi ) detection methods and classified them as kicked out .",
    "they speculated that when the x atom kicks out a x@xmath0o molecule , most of the energy is transferred into translation and much less into internal energy because the x atom hits the x@xmath0o molecule close to the center of mass .",
    "this is supported by our simulations ( e.g. , @xmath989",
    "@xmath24 of the trajectories classified as kicked out occurs when the x atom kicks the x@xmath0o molecule close to the oxygen atom at @xmath36=10  k ) ( x = h , d ) .",
    "isotope effects are also observed in our calculations : the efficiency of energy transfer from d to intramolecular vibrational modes of d@xmath0o molecule in gas phase collisions is larger than the corresponding efficiency for collisions of h with h@xmath0o , because d is heavier than h and because the vibrational frequencies of d@xmath0o are lower than those of h@xmath0o .",
    "[ figure5](a ) shows the average of the d@xmath0o photodesorption probabilities compared with those for h@xmath0o @xcite over the top four monolayers versus ice temperature .",

    "[ figure5](b ) , and those due to the direct mechanism in fig .",
    "[ figure5](c ) .",
    "the total average d@xmath0o photodesorption probabilities are larger than those for h@xmath0o ( fig .",
    "[ figure5](a ) ) because of the large contribution of the d@xmath0o kick - out mechanism ( fig .",
    "[ figure5](b ) ) . for every ice temperature studied , the d@xmath0o photodesorption probability due to the kick - out mechanism is larger than that for h@xmath0o ( fig .",
    "[ figure5](b ) ) , because in the case of heavy water , the d atom formed after d@xmath0o photodissociation has a larger momentum ( by about a factor @xmath16 ) than the h atom formed after h@xmath0o photodissociation .",
    "in addition , the efficiency of momentum transfer from d to d@xmath0o is larger than that from h to h@xmath0o , so that the kick - out mechanism is much more successful for d@xmath0o .",
    "the effect occurs mainly after photoexcitation in the second and third monolayers ( see figs .  [",
    "figure6](b ) and [ figure6](c ) ) , because a d atom produced in these mls is more likely to kick - out a molecule located above it @xcite .",
    "the kick - out photodesorption probabilities are much lower in the first and fourth mls ( figs .",
    "[ figure6](a ) and [ figure6](d ) ) , where there are no important differences between d@xmath0o and h@xmath0o .",
    "we have calculated the probabilities of the parallel outcomes that take place in coincidence with the kicking out of a d@xmath0o molecule by an energetic d atom .",

    "in this work we have studied the processes following uv photodissociation of d@xmath0o in amorphous heavy water ice and compared them with previous uv photodissociation results in h@xmath0o ice at different ice temperatures , in order to investigate isotope effects in photodesorption .",
    "d atom photodesorption is the most important desorption process in the uppermost mls of the ice , like h atom photodesorption .",
    "the average d atom photodesorption probability is smaller than that of the h atom , because in the top two mls of the ice both the h and d atom can easily escape from the ice surface , but if the atoms are located in the third and fourth mls , the d atom is less likely to penetrate the upper ice layers due to more efficient collision energy transfer to d@xmath0o .",
    "therefore , the d atom photodesorption probabilities in these mls decrease , and the same is then for the average d atom photodesorption probability .",

    "od and oh radical photodesorption constitute the second most important desorption channel in the top two mls of the ice .",
    "deeper into the ice the probabilities of these processes drop because od and oh radicals do not have enough translational energy to desorb from the surface .",
    "the average od photodesorption probability is higher than that of oh .",
    "this trend can be explained by the initial translational energy of od being higher by about a factor 1.8 , a result obtained if the photoexcited molecule is considered to be isolated ( i.e. , in the absence of the surrounding ice ) and the laws of momentum and energy conservation are applied .",
    "the average od photodesorption probabilities increase smoothly with ice temperature , by about 24  @xmath24 from 10 to 90  k.    the third most important desorption mechanism is d@xmath0o and h@xmath0o photodesorption .",
    "this process takes place either by direct desorption of the photoexcited molecule after the recombination of d ( h ) and od ( oh ) or by indirect desorption due to an energetic d ( h ) atom which transfers part of its momentum to a surrounding molecule that is kicked out from the ice surface .",
    "the average photodesorption probability is higher for d@xmath0o than for h@xmath0o at all ice temperatures considered .",
    "this trend is due to the contribution of the kick - out mechanism , which is much more important for d@xmath0o than for h@xmath0o . this result",
    "is expected because the photoproduced d atoms have higher average momentum ( by about a factor @xmath16 ) than the h atoms , and because energy transfer in d ",
    "d@xmath0o collisions is more efficient than energy transfer in h  h@xmath0o collisions .",
    "the kick - out mechanism mainly takes place when the photoexcited molecule is initially located in the second and third mls of the ice .",
    "photodissociation leads to an energetic d ( h ) atom that can transfer its momentum to a molecule located above it , which will desorb from the ice if it has enough kinetic energy .",
    "the average direct photodesorption probability ( which involves recombination ) does not show any isotope effect .",
    "the average total d@xmath0o photodesorption probability tends to increase with ice temperature faster than that of h@xmath0o : by @xmath9130  @xmath24 @xmath58 @xmath930  @xmath24 , from 10 to 90  k.    experiments show , and a consideration of the mechanism suggests , that the kicked out molecules leave the surface vibrationally cold .",
    "in contrast , the molecules that desorb due to the direct mechanism are formed vibrationally excited .",
    "the average translational and rotational energies in which the d@xmath0o and h@xmath0o molecules desorb due to the kick - out mechanism have been calculated and compared with the corresponding experimental values at 90  k. the agreement between our md calculations and the experimental measurements is good , and leads to the conclusion that the final energies with which the kicked out molecules are formed do not display an isotope effect .    we have also estimated the total photodesorption probability ( od@xmath55 + d@xmath0o@xmath55 ) per incident photon from the total photodesorption probabilities per absorbed uv photon , and compared this quantity with the previously calculated values for ( oh@xmath55 + h@xmath0o@xmath55 ) , and with the available experimental yields . our total photodesorption probability for d@xmath0o compares better with the experimental photodesorption yield than that for h@xmath0o , and also better at low ice temperatures .",
    "presumably at higher ice temperatures long time scale processes become increasingly important , such as diffusion and thermal desorption , which are not covered in our picosecond simulations .",
    "current experiments can not distinguish between ( oh + h@xmath0o ) and ( od + d@xmath0o ) yields within the experimental uncertainties of 60@xmath24 .",
    "more accurate future experiments may reveal the isotope effects predicted here .",
