    "as an important way in testing the standard model and searching for new physics , rare @xmath5 decays become important in particle physics .",
    "although some of them have been measured by @xmath5 factories , many of them are still under study from both experimental and theoretical sides . in theoretical side ,",
    "the factorization approach has been accepted because it can explain many decay branching ratios successfully . recently",
    "many efforts have been made to explain the reason why the factorization approach has worked well .",
    "one of them is perturbative qcd approach ( pqcd ) @xcite , in which we can calculate the annihilation diagrams as well as the factorizable and non - factorizable diagrams .",
    "it has been applied to exclusive @xmath5 meson decays , such as @xmath6 @xcite , @xmath7 @xcite , @xmath8 @xcite and some other channels @xcite .",
    "recently , j. o. eeg @xmath9 . computed the @xmath10 and @xmath11 decays using heavy - light chiral quark model which is a non - perturbative approach @xcite . as shown in fig.[fig : diagrams1 ] , the four quarks in final states @xmath12 and @xmath13 are different from the ones in the @xmath5 meson , and there is no spectator quark .",
    "so this decay is a pure annihilation type decay . in the factorization approach ,",
    "this decay is described as @xmath14 and @xmath15 in @xmath5 meson annihilation into vacuum and @xmath12 , @xmath13 being produced from vacuum afterwards .",
    "if we calculate this decay in factorization approach @xcite , we need the @xmath16 form factor at very large momentum transfer @xmath17 , but it is zero due to vector current conservation .",
    "so it is difficult to calculate this decay model in factorization approach . in the so called qcd factorization approach @xcite , the annihilation contribution is plagued by the endpoint singularity .",
    "thus it is only parameterized as a free parameter for this kind of contribution . on the other hand , by including the transverse momentum of the partons , the pqcd approach is free of such singularities .",
    "furthermore , the sudakov factor induced by the inclusion of transverse momentum helps the convergence of factorization .",
    "pqcd approach has been recently applied to @xmath5 meson decays with one charmed meson in the final states @xcite . in the typical",
    "@xmath18 decays , the momentum of the final state meson is approximately @xmath19 , with @xmath20 .",
    "this is still large enough to make a hard intermediate gluon in the hard part calculation .",
    "therefore the predicted results in pqcd agree well with the experimental data .",
    "the pqcd calculation of @xmath21 and @xmath22 decays with two charmed mesons in final states may be questionable , since the momentum of final state meson here is relatively smaller than that of @xmath18 case .",
    "however , after calculation we find that the momentum of final state @xmath23 meson is @xmath24 , which is only a little smaller than that of @xmath25 case .",
    "for example , the @xmath26 boson exchange causes @xmath27 , and the @xmath28 quarks are produced from a gluon .",
    "this gluon attaches to any one of the quarks participating in the @xmath26 boson exchange . in the heavy quark limit",
    ", we apply the hierarchy approximation , which is adopted by ref.@xcite , @xmath29 . in this limit ,",
    "the d meson momentum is nearly @xmath30 . according to the distribution amplitude used in ref.@xcite , the light quark in d meson carrying nearly @xmath31 of the d meson momentum .",
    "it is still a collinear quark with 1 gev energy , like that in @xmath18 , @xmath32 decays .",
    "therefore the gluon connecting them is a hard gluon , so we can perturbatively treat the process where the four - quark operator exchanges a hard gluon with @xmath33 quark pair .",
    "the framework of pqcd and analytic formulas for the decay amplitudes will be shown in the next section . in section [ sc :",
    "neval ] , we give the numerical results and discussion . finally , we conclude this study in section [ sc : concl ] .",
    "the factorization theorem allows us to separate the decay amplitude into soft(@xmath34 ) , hard(@xmath35 ) , and harder ( @xmath36 ) dynamics characterized by different scales @xcite .",
    "it is expressed as @xmath37 , \\label{eq : convolution1}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 s are momenta of light quarks included in each meson , and @xmath39 is the trace over dirac and color indices .",
    "the soft dynamic is factorized into the meson wave function @xmath40 , which describes hadronization of the quark and anti - quark pair into the meson @xmath41 .",
    "the harder dynamic involves the four quark operators described by the wilson coefficient @xmath42 .",
    "it results from the radiative corrections to the four quark operators at short distance .",
    "@xmath35 describes the four quark operator and the quark pair from the sea connected by a hard gluon whose scale is at the order of @xmath43 , so the hard part @xmath35 can be perturbatively calculated .",
    "the hard and harder dynamics together make an effective six quark interaction .",
    "the @xmath35 depends on the specific process , while @xmath40 is independent of any processes . therefore we may determine @xmath40 by other well measured channels to make prediction here .",
    "we consider the @xmath5 meson at rest for simplicity .",
    "it is convenient to use light - cone coordinates @xmath44 , which is defined as : @xmath45 thus , expanding up to the order of @xmath46 , we can take the @xmath5 meson and two @xmath47 meson momenta as : @xmath48 where @xmath49 .",
    "putting the light ( anti-)quark momenta in @xmath5 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 mesons as @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 , respectively , we can choose @xmath55 unlike qcd factorization approach , we do not neglect the transverse momentum @xmath56 in the above expressions , by which to avoid the endpoint singularity .    if the decay involves one or two vector mesons in final states , the longitudinal polarization vectors @xmath57 , @xmath58 up to the order of @xmath46 are given by @xmath59 and transverse polarization vectors @xmath60 , @xmath61",
    "are @xmath62 then , integration over @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 in eq.([eq : convolution1 ] ) leads to : @xmath66 , \\label{eq : convolution2}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 is the conjugate space coordinate of the transverse momentum @xmath68 , and @xmath69 is the largest energy scale in @xmath35 , as a function in terms of @xmath70 and @xmath67 .",
    "the last term , @xmath71 , contains two kinds of logarithms .",
    "one of the large logarithms is due to the renormalization of ultra - violet divergence @xmath72 , the other is double logarithm @xmath73 from the overlap of collinear and soft gluon corrections .",
    "this sudakov form factor suppresses the soft dynamics effectively @xcite , so it makes a perturbative calculation of hard part @xmath35 applicable at the intermediate scale .    as a heavy meson ,",
    "the @xmath5 meson wave function is not well defined , so is @xmath74 meson . in heavy quark limit , we may use only one independent distribution amplitude for each of them .",

    "the @xmath46 terms are kept in the denominators of ( [ eq : propagator2 ] ) , since it may sometimes affect the imaginary part heavily .",
    "it is easy to see that the momentum carried by the intermediate gluon is @xmath111 which is only suppressed by a factor of @xmath112 , comparing with that of the charmless @xmath32 decay @xcite . in the heavy quark limit , @xmath113 , the momentum of the gluon is the same for the two kinds of decays .",
    "the formulas derived here support the argument at the introduction that perturbative calculation is still applicable to the @xmath114 decays .",
    "the decay width @xmath115 for @xmath116 decay is then given by @xmath117 similar to decay @xmath10 , the width for @xmath118 is @xmath119 one need only replace the @xmath120 wave function @xmath121 by @xmath74 meson .",
    "enhanced by the ckm factor @xmath122 , the @xmath123 decay width will be larger than that of @xmath124 decay .      for final states with one pseudo - scalar and one vector mesons , only the longitudinal polarization of vector meson contribute .",
    "the decay amplitude takes the same form as the amplitude of @xmath5 to two pseudo - scalar mesons ( [ eq : ma1 ] ) . for decay @xmath129 ,",
    "one need only replace one of the @xmath120 meson distribution amplitude by @xmath130 one .",

    "the contributions of fig1.(a ) and ( b ) can not be cancelled by each other because of the difference of @xmath133 and @xmath134 , but it is still negligible .",
    "accordingly , the @xmath127 , @xmath128 decay amplitudes also take the same form as @xmath135 .",
    "there are contributions not only from the longitudinal polarization but also from two transverse polarizations in @xmath138 decays , where @xmath139 denotes the vector meson .",
    "therefore the decays @xmath136 and @xmath137 are more complicated than @xmath140 or @xmath141 .    in the covariant form ,",
    "the decay amplitudes of non - factorizable annihilation diagrams are @xmath142\\\\ + ( \\epsilon_2 \\cdot p_3)(\\epsilon_3 \\cdot p_2 ) ( x_2-x_3 ) \\bigl [ e_{m}(t_{m}^1 ) h_a^{(1)}(x_1 , x_2,x_3,b_1,b_2 ) + e_{m}(t_{m}^2 ) h_a^{(2)}(x_1 , x_2,x_3,b_1,b_2 ) \\bigr]\\\\ -i \\varepsilon^{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}\\epsilon_{2\\mu}\\epsilon_{3\\nu } p_{2\\rho } p_{3\\sigma } ( x_2-x_3 ) \\bigl [ e_{m}(t_{m}^1 ) h_a^{(1)}(x_1 , x_2,x_3,b_1,b_2)-e_{m}(t_{m}^2 ) h_a^{(2)}(x_1 , x_2,x_3,b_1,b_2 )    \\bigr]\\biggr\\ } , \\label{eq : ma32}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] with the convention @xmath143 and @xmath144 . just as section ( [ s1 ] ) , the contributions of diagrams(a ) and ( b ) cancel each other .",
    "if we set the @xmath145 to be longitudinal polarization only , the above formula goes back to the eq.([eq : ma1 ] ) . from the above functions",
