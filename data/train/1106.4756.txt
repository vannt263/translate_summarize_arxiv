    "from the observation of neutrino oscillations , we now know that lepton flavors ( electron , muon and tau number ) are not conserved",
    ". however , the mixing and small neutrino mass differences seen in oscillations have negligible effect on charged - lepton flavor violating ( clfv ) reactions such as @xmath1 or @xmath2 ( now predicted to occur with unobservable tiny branching ratios of about @xmath3 ) .",
    "so , if charged - lepton flavor violation were to be experimentally detected , it would have to come from `` new physics '' such as supersymmetry , heavy neutrino mixing , leptoquark interactions or some other extension of the standard model .",
    "in that way , charged - lepton number violating reactions provide a discovery window to interactions , beyond standard model expectations , reaching effective - mass scales above @xmath4 @xcite .    because muons can be copiously produced at accelerators and are relatively long lived ( @xmath5 ) , they have been at the forefront of searches for clfv @xcite .",
    "one reaction that can be probed with particularly high sensitivity is the muon - electron conversion in a muonic atom , @xmath6 where @xmath7 represents a nucleus of atomic number @xmath8 and mass number @xmath9 .",
    "various experiments have been performed over the years to search for this process @xcite .",
    "the most recent , and stringent , results come from the sindrum ii collaboration @xcite , which reports an upper limit of @xmath10 for the branching ratio of the conversion process relative to muon capture in gold , and a similar unpublished bound for titanium .",
    "several new efforts are being planned . in the nearest future",
    ", the deeme collaboration @xcite has proposed to reach @xmath11 sensitivity .",
    "larger scale searches , mu2e at fermilab @xcite and comet at j - parc @xcite , aim for sensitivities below @xmath12 . in the long run , intensity upgrades at fermilab and the proposal prism / prime at j - parc may allow them to reach @xmath13 sensitivity , a limit only accessible with muon - electron conversion in nuclei . for comparison , the current best upper bound on the branching ratio of the decay @xmath1 , set by the mega experiment , is @xmath14 ( @xmath15 confidence level ) @xcite .",
    "for some mechanisms of clfv , the conversion process is less sensitive than @xmath1 by a factor on the order of a few hundred @xcite . but even in those cases , a @xmath11 conversion search is more sensitive than this best current bound , and may be competitive with the new search for @xmath1 by the meg experiment @xcite .",
    "in addition , the conversion process is also sensitive to clfv chiral - conserving amplitudes that do not contribute to @xmath1 .",

    "nuclear - recoil effects which , as we will discuss later , need to be considered in the high - energy region were only included in the born approximation ( that is , using the non - relativistic schrdinger wave function for the muon and a plane wave for the electron ) , which is not adequate for the high - energy tail .",

    "@xcite presented similar expressions for the electron spectrum completely neglecting nuclear - recoil effects , evaluating it for several different elements .",
