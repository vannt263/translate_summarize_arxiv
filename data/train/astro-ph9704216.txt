    "it is part of astronomical lore that we inhabit an overly large spiral galaxy .",
    "this belief has little grounding but remains as a hang - over from early large estimates of the value of the hubble parameter ( @xmath1 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 ) which implied that the milky way was perhaps the largest spiral galaxy in the observable universe ( hubble 1936 ) .",
    "there is still considerable uncertainty about the value of @xmath3 , and values as high as 80 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 and as low as 50 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 have recently appeared in the literature ( freedman 1994 ; sandage 1996 ) . when the linear diameters of distant galaxies are measured from their angular diameters and distances obtained solely from their redshifts , high values of @xmath3",
    "make galaxies closer and therefore smaller .",
    "such a situation goes against the cosmological prejudice that applies the principle of terrestrial mediocrity : that there is nothing special about where or when we live and observe from ( vilenkin 1995 ) .",
    "we seem to live on an ordinary planet orbiting an ordinary star , and it is natural to infer that the solar system resides in an ordinary galaxy .",
    "the diameter of a galaxy is problematic to define and here we take it to be the face - on diameter of the 25 b - mag arcsec@xmath4 isophote , allowing direct comparison between external galaxies and the milky way .",
    "we present calculations of the true 25 b - mag arcsec@xmath4 isophotal diameters of 15 spiral galaxies with independent distance estimates derived from cepheid variable observations , mostly carried out in the past few years with the hubble space telescope , and compare these with the inferred diameter of the milky way at this same surface brightness .",
    "until recently , it has not been possible to compare the size of the milky way with the sizes of a statistically meaningful sample of other nearby spirals because very few independent distance estimates had been obtained to such galaxies .",
    "this situation has now changed dramatically with the advent of the hubble space telescope .",
    "the external galaxies in our sample were chosen because they have distances that have been determined via the application of the cepheid period - luminosity relation , which has long been recognised as the most reliable primary extragalactic distance indicator .",
    "the availability of an accurate independent distance estimate removes any requirement to assume a hubble parameter or correct for any peculiar motion .",
    "17 calibrating galaxies were chosen , mainly from the targets of the hst ` key project ' survey ( kennicutt , freedman & mould 1995 ) whose distances have recently been collated in the literature ( giovanelli 1996 ; freedman 1996 ) .",
    "all of these galaxies are included in the rc3 bright galaxy catalogue from which their hubble type ( @xmath5 ) and isophotal diameters ( @xmath6 ) were taken ( de vaucoulers et al .",
    "these isophotal diameters have been corrected for galactic extinction but not for inclination as the rc3 catalogue assumes that the discs are optically thick and hence the major axis diameter is used directly .",
    "table 1 presents the angular diameters , distances and inferred linear diameters of 17 spiral galaxies .",
    ".the hubble type @xmath5 , face - on angular 25 b - mag arcsec@xmath4 isophotal diameters @xmath6 , cephied distances @xmath7 and actual 25 b - mag arcsec@xmath4 isophotal diameters @xmath8 for 17 spiral galaxies . [",

    "the 25 b - mag arcsec@xmath4 isophotal diameter of the milky way has been calculated by assuming that the galactic disc is well represented by an exponential disc ( freeman 1970 ) and using the surface brightness profile equation from de jong ( 1996 )    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the central surface brightness of a galaxy and @xmath11 is the disc scale length . for the milky way @xmath12 b - mag arcsec@xmath4 and @xmath13 kpc ( van der kruit 1987 , 1990 ) .",
    "this leads to a derived 25 b - mag arcsec@xmath4 isophotal diameter for the milky way of    @xmath14    in order to test the validity of the above formula we applied it to the two galaxies in the calibrating sample for which values of @xmath11 and @xmath10 were available to us : m31 ( van der kruit 1990 ) and m100 ( van der kruit 1987 ) .",
    "the @xmath15 diameter for m31 was found to be 43.2 kpc ( 5.5% below the rc3 value ) and that for m100 was found to be 36.3 kpc ( 0.3% above the rc3 value ) .",
    "this gives us confidence that the assumption of an exponential disc is justified and reasonable .",
    "there is some uncertainty as to the hubble type of the milky way .",
    "evidence appears to favour a classification of the milky way as an sbc galaxy ( @xmath16 ) , however morphologies between sab and scd ( @xmath17 to 6 ) can not be ruled out ( van der kruit 1987 , 1990 )",
    ". there has also been recent evidence indicating the presence of a triaxial bar - like structure in the central region of the milky way , with a major axis scale length of the order of 1 kpc ( stanek et al .",
    "it seems unlikely that the existence of such a bar would significantly bias the determination of the disc scale length for the milky way quoted above , although we intend in future work to carry out a more detailed comparison of disc sizes in barred and unbarred galaxies .",
    "figure 1 shows a histogram of the distribution of spiral galaxy sizes for all of the 18 galaxies in our sample , with the positions of the milky way and m31 indicated .",
    "the milky way lies almost exactly on the mean of the galaxy sizes ( actually , just below the average as @xmath18 kpc ) .",
    "it is even more interesting to compare the milky way with galaxies of a similar hubble type .",
    "figure 2 shows the histogram obtained for the 12 galaxies of hubble types 2 through 6 . in this case",
    "the milky way lies further below the average linear diameter of 33.6 kpc ; one should not read too much into this , however , since the milky way still lies well within one standard deviation of the sample mean .",
    "a more quantitative statistical analysis would clearly require a larger calibrating sample and also a more realistic model for the distribution of linear diameters ( sodre & lahav 1993 ) .",
    "there seems no doubt , however , that the milky way is _ not _ one of the largest spiral galaxies .",
    "ngc 1365 and ngc 5457 ( m101 ) , in particular , are the local giants , more than twice as large as the milky way .",
    "this confirms eddington s ( 1933 ) prescient comment , made more than 60 years ago that the ` relation of the milky way to the other galaxies is a subject upon which more light will be thrown by further observational research , and that ultimately we shall find that there are many galaxies of a size equal to and surpassing our own . '",
    "the implications of this conclusion for estimates of the hubble parameter are clear - specifically , if the milky way is an average spiral this may favour estimates of @xmath3 at the lower end of the range of accepted values .",
    "we are carrying out a detailed analysis of the implications for @xmath3 which will be published shortly ."
