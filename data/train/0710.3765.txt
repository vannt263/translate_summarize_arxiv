    "the knot invariant we will be concerned with in this article is called _ fox coloring _ ( @xcite ) .",
    "we now elaborate on fox colorings . given any knot diagram of the knot under study",
    ", the arcs of the diagram stand for algebraic unknowns and the equation `` the sum of the under - arcs equals twice the over - arc '' is read off at each crossing ( see figure [ fi : crosseq ] ) .",
    "the system of equations so obtained has a matrix of coefficients over the integers .",
    "the equivalence class of this matrix under elementary operations on matrices ( as listed on page 50 of @xcite ) over the integers constitutes an invariant of the knot under study .",
    "the elementary operations on matrices over the integers are standard row and column operations plus enlarging the matrix by a row and column of zeros except for the diagonal entry of @xmath0 , or removing such a row and column .",
    "other invariants of the knot stemming from this one are the following .",
    "the invariant factors of the equivalence class of the matrix ; any first minor ( also known as the determinant of the knot ) ; the number of solutions of the system of equations over the integers modulo @xmath1 ( also known as the number of fox @xmath1-colorings ) .",
    "the minimum number of distinct colors it takes to represent such a nontrivial solution ( i.e. , a solution such that at least two unknowns take on different values ) across the diagrams that represent this knot , is a subtle and interesting invariant ( @xcite ) .",
    "some of these invariants are easy to calculate and , at the same time , seem to be effective enough to be interesting ( number of colorings , see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "others are hard to determine and related to elusive conjectures ( minima of colors , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    in @xcite",
    "a brute force approach was used : a knot diagram was introduced into a computer program that converted it into a coloring system of equations .",
    "then , candidates for solutions of the coloring system of equations were tested .",
    "finally , the actual solutions were counted ( @xcite ) .",
    "in @xcite the focus was on a particular class of knots and a general formula was obtained for the number of colorings . for this class of knots , a gaussian reduction of the systems of equations",
    "was developed by inspection of the knot diagram under study .",
    "some unknowns were enough to express the rest of them .",
    "this led to the development of a black - box approach to diagrams .",
    "what is inside a given part of the diagram , the so - called black - box , is ignored .",
    "all that matters is that there is a `` color input '' and a `` color output '' to this part of the diagram . by calculating the propagation of the `` color input '' down the black - box ,",
    "the `` color output '' is specified in terms of the `` color input '' and the `` size '' of the black - box .",
    "finally we equate this `` color output '' to the `` color input '' in order to obtain the coloring system of equations and other invariants like the determinant of the knot ( we elucidate this below , see section [ sect : black - box ] ) .",
    "this technique can then be applied to more complicated situations . whenever a knot diagram involves some combination of these black - boxes , we use this approach , thus reducing the number of unknowns and the number of equations we have to work with .",
    "a particular situation comes up with a `` twist '' , which is obtained by twisting two line segments an assigned number of times ( see the left - hand side of figure [ fi : tref ] for a particular twist ) .",
    "since the propagation of colors down a twist is well - understood ( see @xcite ) and since rational knots ( see section [ sect : rational ] below ) can be regarded as special stackings of twists , we look into calculating the propagation of colors down the twists of a rational knot .",
    "we denote @xmath2 the rational knot with @xmath3 crossings on the @xmath4-th twist .",
    "the formulas we obtain involve three polynomials in the number of crossings on each twist , the @xmath3 s . these polynomials are closely related to the set of increasing sequences of integers from @xmath5 whose terms of even order are even and whose terms of odd order are odd , call this set @xmath6 $ ] .",
    "the coefficients of these polynomials are all equal to @xmath0 . in each monomial",
