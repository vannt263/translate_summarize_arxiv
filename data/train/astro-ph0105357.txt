    "dwarf irregular and blue compact ( bcd ) galaxies are extremely useful to study galaxy evolution .",
    "the closest stellar systems of this type allow us to examine in detail phenomena  like the occurrence of star formation ( sf ) bursts and galactic winds triggered by supernova ( sn ) explosions , the chemical enrichment of the interstellar ( ism ) and intergalactic ( igm ) medium  which are important not only to understand their cosmological evolution , but also to infer the physics directly related to these processes .",
    "thanks to their low metallicity , late - type galaxies are fundamental to infer the primordial @xmath5he abundance ( e.g. izotov , thuan , & lipovetsky 1997 ; peimbert , peimbert , & ruiz 2000 ) , and to check the self - consistency of standard big bang nucleosynthesis theories .",
    "this , however , requires not only a careful analysis of the abundances derived from hii - region spectra , but also a safe understanding of the relative enrichment of the involved elements ( @xmath5he , @xmath6n and @xmath7o ) , which depends both on the sf history and on the gas flows in and out of the system .",
    "galactic winds can be an important factor in galaxy evolution , and are suggested to be particularly effective in low - mass galaxies with strong sf activity , due to the combination of high energy input from sne and low potential well .",
    "the detection of gaseous halos around starburst galaxies supports this idea ( heckman et al .",
    ". the observed chemical properties of irregulars and bcds , including the empirical @xmath8 relation , further suggest that the galactic winds are more enriched in elements like oxygen produced by massive stars and ejected by type ii sne ( e.g. matteucci & tosi 1985 ; pilyugin 1993 ; marconi , matteucci , & tosi 1994 ; but see also larsen , sommer - larsen , & pagel 2000 ) , than in elements like helium , mostly produced by lower - mass , longer - lived stars .    the sf history of dwarf galaxies is also crucial to check whether or not they can represent the local counterpart of the faint blue galaxies found in excess in deep imaging surveys , as suggested by e.g. lilly et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , and babul & ferguson ( 1996 ) .",
    "a detailed analysis of the sf history in ngc  1569 over the last 0.2 gyr ( greggio et al . 1998 , hereafter g98 ) has indeed confirmed that at least some of the most active dwarf galaxies have a sf rate ( sfr ) that would make them contributing to those counts if substained in the right time interval .",
    "what remains to be ascertained is the fraction of dwarf galaxies with a sufficiently high sfr , and the existence of such strong bursts at epochs corresponding to the redshifts where the excess is found ( z@xmath90.71.0 ) . in this sense",
    "it becomes of primary importance to check if all the irregulars have formed stars already several gyrs ago , and how many of them have had an intense sf activity in their remote past . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the circumstance that even i  zw  18 , so far considered as the prototype of really young galaxies , contains stars born at least several hundreds myr ago ( aloisi et al . 1999 , hereafter atg ; ostlin 2000 ) is not sufficient _ per se _ to demonstrate that none of the dwarfs has started only recently ( @xmath1 40 myr ago , see izotov & thuan 1999 ) to form stars .",
    "these questions need to be quantitatively addressed in order to achieve a consistent picture on the evolution of late - type galaxies .",
    "the nearby irregular galaxy ngc  1705 is an ideal benchmark from this point of view .",
    "it is in fact one of the late - type dwarfs with the best documented proof of an ongoing galactic outflow ( meurer et al .",
    "1992 , hereafter mfdc ; heckman et al .",
    "the outflow is likely to be strongly enriched in metals by supernova explosions and stellar winds ( sahu & blades 1997 ) , as often invoked by theoretical chemical evolution models of dwarf irregulars and bcds ( e.g. marconi et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "ngc  1705 ( @xmath10 , @xmath11=261.08 and @xmath12=38.74 ) is a dwarf galaxy with apparent magnitudes @xmath13=12.8 and @xmath14=12.3 .",
    "its nucleus hosts a luminous super star cluster ( ssc ) with estimated mass @xmath15 m@xmath16 , probably a proto - globular cluster only 10 myr old ( melnick et al . 1985 ; oconnell et al .",
    "1994 ; ho & filippenko 1996 ) .",
    "the galaxy has been classified by mfdc as a bcd with a fairly continuous sf regime and an approximate oxygen abundance 12+log(o / h)@xmath98.46 , similar to that of the large magellanic cloud",
    ". a more precise oxygen abundance of 8.36 has been derived by storchi - bergmann , calzetti & kinney ( 1994 ) from uv , optical and near infrared spectra .",
    "ground - based work ( e.g. quillen et al .",
    "1995 ) revealed the presence of a composite stellar population , with the older ( @xmath0110gyr ) field population defining the galaxy morphology .",
    "uv spectra acquired with hst ( heckman & leitherer 1997 ) showed that nearly half of the optical / ultraviolet light is contributed by the young stellar population , and possibly by the central ssc which may also power the observed bipolar outflow . from the lack of spectral stellar wind features ,",
    "heckman & leitherer suggested that the stars in the most luminous ssc of ngc  1705 are not more massive than 1030 @xmath17 .",
    "the distance to ngc  1705 is still relatively uncertain , and has been derived from cmds based on pre - costar hst images ( @xmath18 mpc according to oconnell et al .",
    "1995 ) , or from the heliocentric velocity of 628 km s@xmath19 ( 4.7 mpc according to mfdc , 6.2 mpc according to meurer et al .",
    "as shown by sternberg ( 1998 ) , at the quoted distances the ssc is overluminous for its mass and may imply an initial mass function ( imf ) unusually skewed in favor of massive stars .    to study in further detail the stellar populations of ngc  1705 and to infer its sf history ,",
    "we have observed the galaxy with the hst cameras wfpc2 and nic2 in the f555w , f814w , f110w and f160w filters , deriving the cmds of its resolved stars from these datasets . in this paper",
    "we present these new data and the resulting cmds ( sections 2 , 3 and 4 ) . from the magnitude of the trgb ( section 5 )",
    "we derive a new estimate of the distance modulus , while the comparison of the empirical cmds with theoretical stellar evolution tracks ( section 6 ) indicates the major evolutionary features of the stellar populations in ngc  1705 .",
    "the results are discussed and summarized in section 7 .",
    "the infrared observations were performed on 1998 march 17 , and repeated on 1998 september 19 due to a suspend mode event of nicmos for a high - energy particle hit during the first observing run .",
    "we used the f110w and f160w broad band filters and the nic2 camera centered on the brightest ssc , which is near the center of ngc  1705 .",
    "the optical observations were performed on 1999 march 47 with the pc camera centered on the ssc and including the nic2 field . a failure in the fine lock guiding mode , coupled with a failure in the star guide reacquisition , prevented us from obtaining some of the requested images in the four f380w , f439w , f555w , and f814w filters . only the long exposures in f555w and f814w",
    "were successfully acquired .",
    "the requested long observations at shorter wavelength , as well as the short exposures in all the four filters , were rescheduled and reacquired on 2000 november 1011 .",
    "the photometric reduction of the bluer filters will be presented in a forthcoming paper ( monelli et al . in preparation ) .",
    "the data successfully acquired with wfpc2 in the first observing run correspond to eight 1300 s exposures in each f555w and f814w filters .",
    "the pointing was organized to follow a box dither pattern with cr - split 0.5 .",
    "this translates into 4 different pointing positions with a point spacing of 0@xmath20559 for wfpc2 , and the following offsets in arcsec : ( 0,0 ) for point 1 , ( 0.5,0.25 ) for point 2 , ( 0.75,0.75 ) for point 3 , and ( 0.25,0.5 ) for point 4 .",
    "two exposures at each dither position were also requested for an easier cosmic - ray removal .",
    "the dithering technique is applied to improve the background estimate , identify hot pixels and smooth local pixel to pixel variations from images taken at different dither points , and improve the image sampling . a problem in the execution of the dither pattern due to a bug in the trans software for the translation from the phase 2 commands to the telescope operations , resulted in 5 exposures at point 1 , and one exposure at each of the other points . despite this ground - based software failure ,",
    "the resulting dither pattern allowed us to correctly remove cosmic rays and better sample the psf , not affecting at all our scientific goal of measuring stellar magnitudes with a photometric error @xmath210.2 mag down to the expected limit of @xmath028 for both   and .    for each filter the 8 dithered frames , calibrated through the standard stsci pipeline procedure ,",

    "( fruchter & hook 1998 ) .",
    "the effective pixel size in the resampled images corresponds to 0@xmath20023 and 0@xmath2005 for the pc and wfcs respectively .",
    "the psf in the resulting _ drizzled _ images has a fwhm of 4.2 , 3.3 , 3.3 , and 3.3 pixels in f555w for pc , wfc2 , wfc3 , and wfc4 respectively .",

    "[ mosaico_bw ] shows a mosaic of the wfpc2 images in the f814w filter , obtained with the vmimregrid task from the eso vimos data reduction software .",
    "the images were regridded to the equatorial coordinate system via a gnomonic projection given by the wcs information in the image headers .",
    "this coordinate system has an uncertainty of possibly more than 3@xmath205 , as indicated by the comparison of the wcs values taken from images at different wavelengths .",
    "the image shows that most of the galaxy falls well within the observed fields .",
    "the bright spot at the center of the pc field is the ssc , whereas the isophotal contour levels divide the galaxy in regions of different surface brightness , corresponding to different crowding conditions .",
    "different regions are numbered from 0 ( the outermost one ) to 7 ( the innermost region , encircled by the white contour ) .",
    "the indicated isophotal contours have average flux density in f814w of 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 , 32 , 128 , 256 counts / px , respectively . throughout this paper",
    "we will refer to these zones as region 0 ... 7 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the isophotal contours are fairly elliptical , smooth ( when not disturbed by especially bright objects ) and concentric .",
    "the only exception is region 7 , which is both off - centered and distorted .",
    "the distortion is due to a sort of spiral pearl necklace ( better visible in fig .",
    "[ pc_nicmos_bw2 ] ) apparently originating from the ssc and leading north .",
    "the ssc is not seated at the center of the isophotal contours , a circumstance confirming the suggestion by heckman & leitherer ( 1997 ) and hensler et al .",
    "( 1998 ) that the ssc is not at the galaxy center .",
    "the photometric reduction of the images has been performed with the daophot package in the iraf environment .",
    "we have followed the same procedure described in atg , the only difference in this case being that we have detected the stars independently in the two bands , without forcing in the shallowest frame the finding process of the objects detected in the deepest one . for each detector",
    "the objects found in both bands were cross - identified with daomatch and daomaster . only the objects with a coordinate offset less than a matching radius of 2.0 pixels ( corresponding approximately to half of the fwhm of the psfs ) were eventually retained . after this match we remained with 19838 objects having a measured magnitude in both f555w and f814w filters in the pc field .",
    "the corresponding numbers are 8525 for the wf2 , 5711 for the wf3 , and 5593 for the wf4 .",
    "the instrumental magnitude of each object in each filter and detector was estimated via a _ psf - fitting technique_. a psf template was constructed by considering the most isolated and clean stars , sparsely distributed over each frame : 4 stars were considered for the pc , 5 for the wf2 , 4 for the wf3 , and 6 for the wf4 .",
    "the zero point of the psf photometry was determined with the standard _ aperture photometry technique _ within a 2 pixel radius aperture .",
    "the conversion of the instrumental magnitudes @xmath22 ( with the exposure time already taken into account ) to the hst vegamag system was performed by following the prescriptions in holtzman et al .",
    "( 1995a , b ) , with the updated values provided by the stsci web page ( see also biretta et al .",

    "it has been directly calculated by considering the encircled energy of single stars in our observational frames .",
    "the second aperture correction @xmath25 is an offset of 0.10 ( irrespective of filter and detector ) to convert the magnitude from the 0@xmath205 radius into a nominal infinite aperture .",

    "the _ contamination _",
    "correction with the new rates derived from baggett & gonzaga ( 1998 ) is practically zero for all the detectors in the two f555w and f814w filters .",
    "we have instead not applied any correction for the _ short vs long anomaly _ ( see e.g. casertano & mutchler 1998 ) , because its value has recently turned out to be more uncertain than previously thought ( casertano , 2000 private communication ) .    for a safe interpretation of the characteristics of the galaxy stellar populations , we need to distinguish as much as possible _ bona fide _ single stars from extended , blended or spurious objects",
    "we have thus applied to our catalogs selection criteria based on the shape of the objects . to this aim",
    "we have considered the daophot parameters @xmath28 and _ sharpness _ : @xmath28 gives the ratio of the observed pixel - to - pixel scatter in the fit residuals to the expected scatter calculated from a predictive model based on the measured detector features , while _ sharpness _ sets the intrinsic angular size of the objects .",
    "we have selected only the objects with @xmath294 in both filters for the pc , @xmath292.2 in f555w and @xmath302.5 in f814w for the three wfs . moreover only detections with 0.5@xmath310.5 in all filters and for all detectors have been eventually retained .",
    "these @xmath28 and _ sharpness _ values turned out to be those allowing to best reject spurious and extended objects , without eliminating also the bright stars . by inspecting the rejected objects , we have recognized several candidate star clusters ( i.e. fairly round but extended objects ) and background galaxies .",
    "we have 17 star clusters ( besides the brightest ssc ) in the pc , 4 in the wf2 , 5 in the wf3 and 3 in the wf4 .",
    "the candidate background galaxies are 13 in the wf2 , 11 in the wf3 , and 18 in the wf4 .",
    "in the latter case , the 18 galaxies occupy only a restricted zone of the wf4 and the concentration is much higher than in the other fields : we are presumably dealing with a real , yet unclassified , galaxy cluster , since the derived galaxy density ( 18 arcmin@xmath32 down to = 22 ) is almost a factor of 5 higher than that predicted by deep counts of field galaxies ( e.g. pozzetti et al .",

    "[ mosaico_bw ] , and we have divided them into six groups according to their position with respect to the isophotal contour levels .",
    "regions 1 and 2 , and regions 4 and 5 , are considered together because both their stellar populations and their crowding conditions turned out to be very similar to each other .",
    "region 7 , despite the low number of stars , has been considered separately from the others , because it contains the brightest ssc and crowding dramatically affects its photometric accuracy and completeness , as will be shown from the artificial stars experiments ( see section 4 ) .      for each filter",
    "we have acquired ten 512 s exposures with a spiral dither pattern of 0@xmath202 for a total integration time of about 85 min .",
    "the dither technique was chosen to account for pixel - to - pixel non - uniformities , and to better sample the psf , which is a very important component in the treatment of crowded stellar fields such as that of ngc  1705 .",
    "the multiaccum readout mode was adopted for each exposure in order to get rid of saturated pixels and cosmic ray events . to this purpose",

    "particular attention was paid to the necessary corrections for all the instrumental anomalies , artifacts and instabilities which are not automatically taken into account by the standard pipeline . among these",
    "are the _ shading _ , the _ pedestal _ , the _ cosmic ray persistence _ , and the _ linearity _ , all effects that we have already considered in al01 . other anomalies ( see dickinson 1999 for details on all the possible anomalies ) were found in the data reduction of ngc  1705 nicmos images .",

    "we got rid of this image anomaly by using an algorithm kindly made available by luis e. bergeron of the stsci nicmos team .    for each filter",

    "as discussed in detail by al01 , the probability of success depends on the combination of crowding , wavelength separation of the available bands , and sf history of the examined region .",
    "for instance , in the case of ngc  1569 , for which we had no f814w image available , we have been able to unambiguously cross - identify only a few stars present in the f110w and f160w frames ( analyzed by al01 ) and in the f439w and f555w frames ( analyzed by g98 ) .",
    "this is because ngc  1569 is very crowded , and has experienced a strong sf burst in the last 0.1 gyr and a conspicuous sf activity between 1.5 and 0.15 gyr ago .",
    "the recent burst provides a large number of hot stars , bright in blue filters but faint in red ones , while the previous sf episode provides a large number of cool stars , bright in red filters but faint in blue ones . these two populations are spatially coincident and it is thus inevitable that the flux peaks detected in different passbands actually correspond to different stars .",
    "the wavelength selection effect is also what causes the blue plume of the optical cmd to be poorly defined in the near - infrared ( nir ) diagram of fig .",
    "[ cm_vjh ] and , conversely , the vertical red finger of the nir cmd to be sparser in the optical one .",
    "this effect has been found and discussed also in other galaxies ( see , e.g. , schulte - ladbeck et al .",

    "the artificial stars experiments described in the next section give a more quantitative description of these wavelength selection effects .",

    "we have performed a series of artificial stars experiments , following the procedure briefly described here .",
    "artificial star experiments have to probe the observational effects associated with the whole process of data reduction of a given frame , i.e. , for instance , the accuracy of the photometric measures , the crowding conditions , the ability of the psf - fitting code in estimating the sky level or in resolving partially overlapped sources , etc .",
    "it is of the utmost importance that the artificial stars do not interfere with each other since in that case the output of the experiments would be biased by _ artificial _ crowding , not present in the original frame . to avoid this potentially serious bias",
    "we have divided the frames in grids of cells of known width , and we have randomly positioned _ only one artificial star per cell _ at each run ( a similar procedure has recently been adopted by piotto & zoccali 1999 ) .",
    "the additional constraint is that each star must have a distance from the cell edges sufficiently large to guarantee that all its flux and background measuring regions fall within the cell . in this way we can control the minimum distance between adjacent stars . at each run",
    "the absolute position of the grid is randomly changed in a way that , after a large number of experiments , the stars are uniformly distributed in coordinates .",
    "the stars were distributed in magnitude with a function similar to the observed luminosity function ( lf ) , except for an excess of faint stars below the detection limit of our observations .",
    "this was to probe with sufficient statistics the ( faint ) range of magnitudes where the incompleteness is expected to be most severe .",
    "we have simulated about @xmath42 stars for each wfpc2 camera and filter , and about @xmath43 for each nic2 image .",
    "the whole series of performed experiments provides @xmath44 artificial stars , for which we have memorized input and output magnitudes , and any other useful parameter .",

    "[ dm_jh ] it is clear that the very concentrated population of bright stars in region 7 produces a high degree of incompleteness at faint magnitudes in this region . the high degree of crowding and the high level of sky background produced by the wings of the many bright stars results in much larger photometric errors and brighter limiting magnitude than in all the other regions ( 0 - 6 ) . outside of this very central part ,",
    "the behavior of @xmath47 as a function of magnitude is quite similar and very well sampled everywhere .",
    "it is particularly interesting to check at which magnitude the effects of blending become significant , i.e. at what level @xmath47 significantly deviates from zero .",

    "therefore the effect of blending can be considered negligible down to very faint magnitudes .",
    "the above limits become significantly fainter if the most external regions are considered ( 0 - 2 ) . in region 0 , which covers a large fraction of all the wf cameras , the average @xmath47 is still virtually null at @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( see also fig .",

    "when blending is not negligible a correct evaluation of @xmath62 should take it into account . in a cmd , the global completeness factor is given by the product of the factors in the two involved passbands , hence it is also a function of the color index . in fig .",

    "it would be interesting to check whether the pearl necklace of bright young stars and the asymmetric distribution of the candidate star clusters displayed in fig .  [ pc_nicmos_bw2 ]",
    "are physically related to the ssc impact on the surrounding environment .",
    "quantitative information on the star formation history of ngc  1705 will be useful also to assess the effect of galactic winds on the chemical enrichment of its ism .",
    "this galaxy has clearly formed stars over several gyrs , most of its old stars have a fairly high metallicity of z=0.004 , and yet it is characterized by strong winds currently removing heavy elements from its ism . was the early metallicity high because of a very strong initial sf ?",
    "is the current wind event the first one occurring over the galaxy lifetime ?",
    "if this is the case , why have not early sf episodes been able to trigger the winds ( especially if the earliest activity was strong ) ? or does it mean that winds do not significantly affect the galaxy metallicity ( for instance , because they involve too small amounts of gas , or because after some time the metals fall back on the galaxy ) ? to try to answer these questions , quantitative estimates of the sf rate and of the imf are necessary .",
    "our forthcoming results from the synthetic cmd method will provide such information , since we will derive the epoch , the duration and the intensity of each major sf episode , and we will infer indications on the most likely imf .",
    "very preliminary results ( annibali et al . 2001 ) indicate that indeed ngc  1705 has been forming stars since 1015 gyr , with different rates at different epochs , but without evidence of strong bursts or really quiescent intervals .",
    "they also suggest that the imf of the young stellar populations is flatter than normal ( with a slope @xmath1121.5 in the usual approximation @xmath113 , where salpeter s slope is 2.35 ) , therefore implying a fraction of massive stars higher than normal .",
    "this unusual imf , even if relative to the field stars and not to the ssc stellar population , is in agreement with one of the two sternberg s ( 1998 ) arguments ( the second one being a truncated imf at a lower mass limit between 1 and 3 @xmath17 ) to explain the ssc overluminosity , which at our derived distance of 5.1 mpc is indeed confirmed .",
    "more accurate and extensive tests in the various regions , as well as the photometric reduction and analysis of the f380w and f439w data , are however necessary to reach firmer conclusions and are currently being performed ( annibali et al . in preparation ; monelli et al . in preparation ) .",
    "we thank luis e. bergeron , stefano casertano , mark dickinson , luciana federici , and matteo monelli for help and suggestions to overcome the data reduction problems .",
    "daniela calzetti , mark clampin , jay gallagher , antonella nota , livia origlia , and lucia pozzetti are warmly thanked for useful information and discussions .",
