    "the study of giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) is of great importance to understand star formation . their properties ( density distribution , dynamics , temperature , etc .",
    ") are thought to be vital in determining whether , where and how stars are forming within them . turbulent motions inside a cloud cause fragmentation and hence determine the density distribution ( padoan et al .",
    "@xcite , ballesteros - paredes et al .",
    "@xcite ) . this in turn should have an influence on which mode of star formation ( isolated or clustered ) is occurring ( klessen , heitch and mac low @xcite ) .",
    "it is , however , unclear if this is the sole determinant of the star formation mode . or are there other important causes such as the environment , feedback and/or magnetic fields ?    one way to try to answer these questions is to investigate the column density structure of a large number of gmcs in a systematic , comparable and unbiased fashion .",
    "this means ideally one should use the same tracer of column density for all clouds .",
    "such a tracer should be as bias free as possible and all clouds should be investigated at the same physical spatial resolution .",
    "there are a number of techniques to determine the column density of clouds .",
    "these include molecular line emission , dust continuum emission , scattered infrared light or extinction measurements .",
    "the latter on the bases of star counts , colour excess or combined methods .",
    "see froebrich & rowles @xcite for a brief summary and discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of the various techniques .",
    "it has been shown by goodman et al .",
    "@xcite that near infrared extinction mapping is the best tracer of the ` real ' column density of a cloud , based only on the assumption of a constant gas to dust ratio .",
    "a number of large scale maps of the column density distribution of clouds have been made to date , which could be used to compare the structure of a number of gmcs .",
    "these are for example the maps by cambrsy , schlegel et al .",
    "@xcite , dobashi et al .",
    "@xcite , froebrich et al .",
    "@xcite and rowles and froebrich @xcite .",
    "some of them do not use the ideal tracer ( extinction ) for the column density .",
    "others use star counts , which result in a distance dependent bias in the column density distribution ( froebrich & del burgo @xcite ) , similar to using the mean colour excess instead of the median .",
    "one bias they all have in common is that clouds at different distances are mapped at different spatial resolutions .",
    "this will naturally lead to a change in the observed column density distribution , since for more distant clouds one averages over larger physical scales .",
    "this will lead to the effect that small scale high extinction regions are averaged out and the column density distributions are skewed . in order to compare the structure of gmcs with each other , one has to determine the column density distribution at similar physical scales and using the same ` good ' tracer for all investigated clouds .",
    "only then can we attempt to draw conclusions about similarities and differences in their structures .",
    "this can be done by analysing the column density and mass distribution ( the focus of this paper ) or determining structure functions ( the focus of the next paper in the series ) and comparing it to model predictions such as published by kolmogorov @xcite , she & leveque @xcite and boldyrev @xcite . in our previous paper ( rowles & froebrich @xcite , paperi hereafter ) we presented all - sky extinction maps determined using data from 2mass ( skrutskie et al .",
    "these were created using an adaptation of the nice method ( lada et al .",
    "@xcite ) , median colour excess determination and variable spatial resolution to obtain a constant signal to noise ratio . here",
    "we present and analyse additional maps , determined using a range of constant spatial resolutions to map different clouds at similar spatial scales .    in sect.[method ]",
    "we briefly describe the new maps created for the project , and explain the data analysis methods . in sect.[results ] we present the results for our selection of nearby gmcs .",
    "we discuss these results and draw conclusions in sect.[dissc ] .",

    "as discussed , there are usually at least two distinct regions with different slopes . one region , at low extinction values ( @xmath17 ) characterises the general turbulence of the cloud . at higher extinction values",

    "in general the @xmath19 values are about twice as negative as the @xmath18 values .",
    "more importantly the scatter for the slopes in the high column density regions of the clouds is smaller than in the low @xmath1 regions .",
    "for the averages and scatter for all clouds we find : @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "this indicates , that once gravity becomes important enough to influence the column density distribution ( i.e. star formation starts ) , then we will find far fewer differences between the various clouds . while at low column densities , where external factors ( proximity to supernovae , etc . )",
    "determine the turbulent motions , much larger cloud to cloud differences are seen .",

    "the slopes for all clouds averaged and interpolated to 0.1pc are summarised in table[anatab ] , the mass distributions are shown in appendix[app6 ] . as for the values of @xmath16 , the scatter of the slopes differs for the low and high column density material .",
    "for the averages of all clouds we find : @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "again , we find that the star forming ( high column density ) parts of the clouds are very similar , while the low @xmath1 ( turbulence dominated ) regions show a larger scatter .",
    "we show how the slopes @xmath26 and @xmath27 depend on the spatial resolution for all clouds in fig.[allsg ] .",
    "we extrapolate the fit to the low @xmath1 regions , which leads to the total mass of the cloud . for the purpose of this paper , we calculate the mass in the cloud at a column density of above 1mag of optical extinction ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "this ensures we do not include noise and also only integrate over material that is above the threshold for self - shielding from uv radiation and molecular hydrogen formation ( hartmann et al .",
    "@xcite ) . extrapolating the high @xmath1 fit towards one solar mass",
    ", one can find the extinction value a core with the jeans mass would have ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "hence , this characterises the maximum extinction in the cloud before collapse starts .",
    "furthermore , we determine the intercept between the low and high @xmath1 region , to characterise above which column density ( @xmath30 ) material is more likely involved in star formation than being characterised by the turbulence in the cloud .",
    "this can be seen as the star formation threshold , i.e. the column density above which star formation occurs in the cloud .",
    "finally , the ratio of the mass in the cloud above an extinction @xmath30 ( the mass currently associated with star formation ) to the total mass of the cloud above 1mag @xmath1 is determined .",
    "assuming that about 1/3 of the total mass associated with star formation is transformed into stars ( alves et al . )",
    "we can estimate the overall fraction of mass involved in star formation ( @xmath31 ) an indicator of the star formation efficiency .",
    "all these values for each cloud are summarised in table[anatab ]",
    ".      +     +",
    "we investigated the column density and mass distribution of a number of gmcs based on near infrared median colour excess extinction maps determined from 2mass .",
    "our multi scale extinction mapping approach enabled us to determine the cloud properties homogeneously at a common scale of 0.1pc for all clouds .",
    "furthermore , it allowed us to investigate how the cloud properties depend on the spatial scale .",
    "we find that for about half the investigated clouds the slope of the column density and mass distribution changes to more negative ( steeper ) values with increasing spatial scale .",
    "for the other half no change is found over a scale range of almost an order of magnitude .",
    "the former can be understood by the fact that at larger scales , small scale high extinction cores are not detected anymore , naturally leading to a steeper mass and column density distribution . in the latter case",
    "this does not happen .",
    "this could mean that there are no small scale high extinction regions .",
    "but this does not seem plausible , in particular since the clouds in this group are e.g. taurus , perseus , ophiuchus and orion .",
    "another possibility is that there is no significant structure in those clouds at the smallest scales , and hence no change over the observed range of scales .",
    "we will analyse this in more detail in a forthcoming paper where we will determine the structure functions of all clouds .",
    "our fits to the column density distributions using a log - normal function resulted in variable outcomes .",
    "some clouds , in particular auriga2 , corona australis , lupus3 , 4 , 5 , 6 and serpens can be fit very well ( @xmath32 lower than 3@xmath33 ) .",
    "other clouds ( cepheus , monoceros , ophiuchus ) can not be fit properly by a log - normal function .",
    "this is in agreement with earlier works on some of these clouds e.g. by lombardi et al . and more recently by kainulainen et al . .",
    "all investigated clouds show an excess of column density compared to a log - normal distribution at higher @xmath1 values .",
    "the quality of the fit is hence a measure of how much excess there is in a particular cloud .",
    "this excess material has decoupled from the general turbulent field and is dominated by gravity , in other words more likely actively involved in star formation .",
    "however , in our sample we could not find any significant correlations of the achieved quality of the log - normal fit with other cloud properties or the amount of young stars in the cloud .",
    "the analysis of the mass distribution enables us to draw further conclusions about the structure of the clouds and their star formation properties .",
    "for all clouds the change in the slope of the mass distribution is more pronounced than in the column density distribution .",
    "it is hence easier to determine the threshold at which gravity becomes the dominant force in shaping the structure .",
    "this value ranges from 3.4mag in lupus1 , 2 to 8.6mag of optical extinction in ophiuchus .",
    "we associate this with the extinction threshold for star formation , originally found to be about 7mag of @xmath1 in ophiuchus by johnstone et al .",
    "@xcite , in agreement with our value . on average for all clouds",
    "we find @xmath34mag optical extinction , a rather small range .",
    "in contrast , the mass fraction of each cloud which is currently involved in star formation varies by almost two orders of magnitude .",
    "it ranges from 0.12% in @xmath35-ori to almost 10% in corona australis .",
    "we note that these values are not an estimate of the star formation efficiency in these clouds .",
    "they rather should be seen as the potential of the cloud to form new stars in the next few 10@xmath10yrs .",
    "the wide range of values indicates that our sample contains clouds at different stages in their evolution .",
    "we see clouds that currently only form a small number of stars ( e.g. auriga1 and corona australis ) but with a completely different fraction of mass involved in star formation . in auriga1",
    "only a small fraction of the total material seems to be available for future star formation . on the contrary in corona",
    "australis a much larger fraction of material is expected to be forming stars . while other regions that currently form stars ( orion , taurus , perseus ) still possess a significant fraction of material in a state which is expected to continue star formation .",
    "one example for a cloud which might have reached the end of star formation seems to be ophiuchus .",
    "it is currently forming a large number of stars , but has only less than one percent of material in a gravity dominated form .",
    "we have searched amongst our determined cloud properties for further correlations . in particular",
    "we hoped to find a link between the predominant mode of star formation in the cloud ( clustered vs. isolated ) with one or several cloud properties .",
    "no such correlation could be found .",
    "this is partly expected since our extinction maps show only how much material is potentially involved in star formation , and not how much gas and dust ( and its properties ) have lead to the star formation mode we currently see in these clouds .",
    "one could expect that the properties of the turbulence dominated part of the clouds ( out of which the denser parts are formed ) show some dependence on the star formation mode . either because different turbulent properties cause different modes of star formation , or that feedback from young star clusters and isolated ysos causes different turbulent properties . but",
    "again , no such dependence could be found in our data .    however , there are clear differences in the properties of the clouds at low column densities compared to high @xmath1 values .",
    "the scatter of the @xmath19 and @xmath26 values between clouds is a factor of 2.5 ( for @xmath16 ) and 4.5 ( for @xmath23 ) larger than for the high extinction regions .",
    "essentially this paints the following picture of the cloud structure : the low @xmath1 and turbulence dominated regions differ from cloud to cloud .",
    "their column density and mass distributions are determined by the environment of the cloud and the feedback they have experienced from the star formation processes within them . above a ( column )",
    "density threshold of about 6mag @xmath1 , which is independent of the cloud , gravity becomes the dominant force in shaping the structure .",
    "this part of the cloud is then more and more decoupled from the influences of its surrounding turbulent field , and thus the column density and mass distributions for all clouds are virtually identical above the extinction threshold .",
    "this also implies that local feedback from young clusters or stars has no significant influence in shaping the column density and mass distributions .",
