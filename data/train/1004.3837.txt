    "collective behaviour of interacting _ intelligent _ agents such as birds , insects or fishes shows highly non - trivial properties and sometimes it seems to be quite counter - intuitive @xcite . as well - known , many - body systems having a lot of _ non - intelligent _ elements , for instance , spins ( tiny magnets in atomic scale length ) , particles , random - walkers etc .",
    "also show a collective behaviour like a critical phenomenon of order - disorder phase transitions with ` spontaneous symmetry breaking ' in spatial structures of the system .",
    "up to now , a huge number of numerical studies in order to figure it out have been done by theoretical physicists and mathematicians @xcite .",
    "they attempted to describe these phenomena by using some probabilistic models and revealed the ` universality class ' of the critical phenomena by solving the problem with the assistance of computer simulations .",
    "of course , the validity of the studies should be checked by comparing the numerical results with the experimental findings . if their results disagree with the empirical data ,",
    "the models they used should be thrown away or should be modified appropriately .",
    "on the other hand , for the mathematical modeling of many - body systems having interacting _ intelligent _ agents ( animals ) , we also use some probabilistic models , however , it is very difficult for us to evaluate the modeling and also very hard to judge whether it looks like _ realistic _ or not due to a lack of enough empirical data to be compared .",
    "one of the key factors for such non - trivial collective behaviour of both _ non - intelligent _ and _ intelligent _ agents is obviously a ` competition ' between several different ( and for most of the cases , these are incompatible ) effects .",
    "for instance , the ising model as an example of collective behaviour of _ non - intelingent _ agents exhibits an order - disorder phase transition @xcite by competition between the ferromagnetic interactions between ising spins ( ` energy minimization ' ) and thermal fluctuation ( ` entropy maximization ' ) by controlling the temperature of the system . on the other hand , as a simplest and effective algorithm in computer simulations for flocks of _ intellingent _ agents , say , animals such as starlings , the so - called boids founded by reynolds @xcite has been widely used not only in the field of computer graphics but also in various other research fields including ethology , physics , control theory , economics , and so on . the boids simulates the collective behaviour of animal flocks by taking into account only a few simple rules for each interacting _ intelligent _ agent .    however , there are few studies to compare the results of the boids simulations with the empirical data .",
    "therefore , the following essential and interesting queries still have been left unsolved ;    * what is a criterion to determine to what extent the flocks seem to be _ realistic _ ? * is there any quantity ( statistics ) to measure the _ quality _ of the artificial flocks ?    from the view point of ` engineering ' , the above queries are ( in some sense ) not essential because their main goal is to construct a useful algorithm based on the collective behaviour of agents .",
    "however , from the natural science view points , the difference between empirical evidence and the result of the simulation is the most important issue and the consistency is a guide to judge the validity of the computer modeling and simulation .",
    "recently , ballerini _ at al _",
    "@xcite succeeded in obtaining the data for such collective animal behaviour , namely , empirical data of starling flocks containing up to a few thousands members .",
    "they also pointed out that the angular density of the nearest neighbors in the flocks is not uniform but apparently biased ( it is weaken ) along the direction of the flock s motion .    with their empirical findings in mind , in this paper , we examine the possibility of the boids simulations to reproduce this _ anisotropy _ and we also investigate numerically the condition on which the anisotropy emerges .    this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we explain the empirical findings by ballerini _",
    "et al _ @xcite and introduce a key concept _ anisotropy _ and a relevant quantity @xmath0-value . in section 3 , the boids modeling and setting of essential parameters in our simulations are explicitly explained .",
    "the results are reported in section 4 .",
    "the last section provides concluding remarks .",
    "in this section , we briefly review the measurement of the realistic flocks and the evaluation of the empirical data by ballerini _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "they measured each bird s position in the flocks of starling ( _ sturnus vulgaris _ ) in three dimension . to get such 3d data , they used ` stereo matching ' which reconstructs 3d - object from a set of stereo photographs .      from these data",
    ", they calculated the angular density of the nearest neighbours in the flock .",
    "they measured the angles ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) , where @xmath1 stands for the ` latitude ' of the nearest neighbour for each bird measured from the direction of the motion of the flock , whereas @xmath2 denotes ` longitude ' which specifies the position of the nearest neighbour for each bird around the direction of flock s motion , for all individuals in the flock and made the 2d - map of angular density distribution using the so - called ` mollweide projection ' .",
    "their figure clealy shows that the density is not uniform but obviously biased .",
    "for instance , we find from the figure that the dinsity around @xmath3 and @xmath4 are extremely low in comparison with the density in the other directions .",
    "the property of the biased distribution due to the absence of the birds along the direction of the flock s motion is referred to as _ anisotropy _",
    "the main goal of this paper is to reveal numerically that the artificial flock by the boids exhibits the anisotropy as the realistic flock shows @xcite . to quantify the degree of the anisotropy",
    ", we use a useful statistics ( a kind of ` order parameters ' in the research field of statistical mechanics ) introduced in the following subsections .",
    "ballerini _ et al _ also introduced a useful indicator , what we call @xmath0-value .",
    "the @xmath0-value is calculated according to the following recipe .",
    "let @xmath5 be an unit vector pointing in the direction of the @xmath6 -nearest neighbour of the bird @xmath7 and let us define the projection matrix @xmath8 in terms of the @xmath5 as follows .",
    "@xmath9 where @xmath10 is the number of birds in the flock .",
    "then , the @xmath0-value is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes the normalized eigenvector corresponding to the smallest eigenvalue of the projection matrix @xmath8 . from the definition ,",
    "the @xmath12 coincides with the direction of the lowest density in the flock .",
    "the vector @xmath13 appearing in the equation ( [ eq : def_gamma ] ) means the unit vector of flock s motion .",
    "the bracket @xmath14 means the average over the ensembles of the flocks .",
    "the @xmath0-value for the uniform distribution of the position @xmath15 for a given vector @xmath13 , namely , the @xmath0 for @xmath16 is easily calculated as @xmath17 where we used @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , the distribution of the @xmath6-nearest neighbours has anisotropic structure when the @xmath0-value is larger than @xmath19 , namely the condition for the emergence of the anisotropy is explicitly written by @xmath20 by measuring this @xmath0-value for artificial flock simulations , one can show that the anisotropy also emerges in computer simulations . to put it into other words ,",
    "the system of flocks is spatially ` symmetric ' for @xmath21 , whereas the symmetry is ` spontaneously ' broken for @xmath22 .",
    "this ` spontaneous symmetry breaking ' is nothing but the emergence of anisotropy .    in the following sections , we carry out the boids simulations and evaluate the anisotropy by the @xmath0-value .",
    "then , we find that the ` spontaneous symmetry breaking ' mentioned above actually takes place by controlling the essential parameters appearing in the boids .",
    "to make flock simulations in computer , we use the so - called boids which was originally designed by reynolds @xcite .",
    "the boids is one of the well - known mathematical ( probabilistic ) models in the research fields of cg and animation .",
    "actually , the boids can simulate very complicated animal flocks or schools although it consists of just only three simple interactions for each agent in the aggregation :    1 .   * cohesion * : making a vector of each agent s position toward the average position of local flock mates .",
    "* alignment * : making a vector of each agent s position towards the average heading of local flock mates and keeping the velocity of each agent the average value of flock mates .",
    "* separation * : controlling the vector of each agent to avoid the collision with the other local flock mates .",
    "it is important for us to bear in mind that ` local flock mates ' mentioned above denotes the neighbours within the range of views for each agent .",
    "each agent decides her ( or his ) next migration by compounding these three interactions .      in our boids simulations ,",
    "each agent is defined as a mass point and specified by a set of 3d - coordinate @xmath23 , an unit vector of motion , and the speed .",
    "we define each agent s view as a sphere with a radius @xmath24 without any blind corner .",
    "we also define the ` separation sphere ' with a radius @xmath25 and the distance between the nearest neighbours is specified by the length @xmath26 ( see figure [ fig : range ] ) .",
    "the interaction of ` separation ' is switched on if and only if the @xmath26 is smaller than the @xmath27 .",
    "some other essential parameters appearing in our boids simulations and the setup are also explicitly given as follows .",
    "* * field of simulations : * three dimensional open space without any gravity or any air resistance .",
    "moreover , there is no wall and no ground surface . * * the number of agents in the flock : * the system size of simulations is @xmath28 * * initial condition on the speed of each agent : * @xmath29 . *",
    "* initial condition on the location of each agent : * all agents are distributed in a sphere with radius @xmath30 . *",
    "* the shape and the range of each agent s view : * a sphere with radius @xmath31 . * * the shape and the range of separation : * a sphere with radius @xmath32 .    for the above setting of the parameters",
    ", we shall implement two types of programming codes .",
    "one is a programing code for a single simulation ( ` ss ' for short ) , and another code is for multiple simulations ( ` ms ' for short ) .",
    "the ss runs in the gui ( graphical user interface ) and it shows us a shape of the flock in real time , whereas the ms enables us to carry out a number of simulations with different initial conditions .      by controling the three essential interactions , namely , ` cohesion ' , ` alignment ' and ` separation ' mentioned above , we obtain four different aggregations having different collective behaviours .",
    "each behavour of the aggregations is monitored ( observed ) by the ss . to specify the aggregation process of the flocks ,",
    "we define the update rule of the vector of movement for each agent by @xmath33 where @xmath34 means the time step of the update and @xmath35 denotes the @xmath36-norm of a vector @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath38 is a vector pointing to the center of mass from each agent s position .",
    "@xmath39 denotes a vector to be obtained by averaging over the velocities of all agents .",
    "@xmath40 means a vector pointing to the direction of the movement of each agent to be separated from her ( or his ) nearest neighbouring mate .",
    "therefore , the aggregation of the flock is completely specified by the weights of the above vectors , namely , @xmath41 . among all possible combinations of these weights",
    ", we shall pick up typical four cases .",
    "each property and the shape of each aggregation are explained as follows .    * _ case 1 _ ( * crowded aggregation ) * : the aggregation obtained by controlling the interaction of ` cohesion ' much stronger than the others , namely , @xmath42 . * _ case 2 _ ( * spread aggregation ) * : the aggregation obtained by controlling the interaction of ` separation ' much stronger than the others , namely , @xmath43 . * _ case 3 _ ( * synchronized aggregation ) * : the aggregation obtained by controlling the interaction of ` alignment ' much stronger than the others , namely , @xmath44 . * _ case 4 _ ( * flock aggregation ) * : this aggregation obtained by adjusting every interactions appropriately , namely , @xmath45 .    using the ms , we simulate each aggregation for @xmath46 times for different initial conditions . in each simulation , we measure the angular distribution and then the value of @xmath0 is calculated .",
    "the number of crash is also updated when the coordinate of each agent is identical to ( is shared with ) the other agents .",
    "we start each measurement from the time point at which the total amount of the change in every agent s speed is close to @xmath47 through the 80 turns of the update . in the next section ,",
    "we explain the details of the result .",
    "in association with the each aggregation , we evaluate the @xmath0-value with standard deviation and the average number of crashes for 200 independent runs of the boids simulations . in following ,",

    "the @xmath0-values are lower than @xmath58 , namely , they have no anisotropy . from these results",
    ", we find that boids computer simulations having appropriate weights @xmath59 shows anisotropy structures as real flocks exhibit .",
    "it is also revealed that one can evaluate to what extent an arbitrary flock simulation is close to real flocks through the @xmath0-value . from the results obtained here , we might have another question , namely , it is important for us to answer the question such as whether the aggregation having a higher @xmath0-value than the _ case 4 _ seems to be more _ realistic _ than the _ case 4 _ or not . to answer the question ,",
    "we carry out the simulations of the flock aggregation which has a higher @xmath0-value ( _ case 5 _ ) than the _ case 4_. the results are summarized as follows .    * _ case 5 _ ( * crowded aggregation ) * : the angular distribution is shown in figure [ fig : fg5 ] . the @xmath0-value is @xmath60 with standard deviation @xmath61 and the average number of crashes is @xmath62 .",
    "-value than the _ case 4_. , width=283 ]    obviously , the above aggregation has the highest @xmath0-value leading to the strongest anisotropy among the five cases .",
    "however , it is hard for us to say that it is an _",
    "optimal flock _ because the number of cashes is also the highest ( @xmath63 times ) and to make matter worse , the number itself is apparently outstanding .",
    "this result tells us that an aggregation having much stronger anisotropic structures is not always a better flock .",
    "the above result is reasonably accepted because the @xmath0-value is calculated from the angular distribution of nearest neighbours without any concept of the _ distance _ between agents .",
    "therefore , the flock having a dense network might have highly risks of crashes more than the sparse network . for this reason , in order to judge whether a given aggregation has a better flock behaviour or not , we should use the other criteria which take into account the distance between nearest neighbours .    inspired by the empirical data analysis by ballerini _",
    "et al _ @xcite , we finally calculate the @xmath0-value as a function of the order of the neighbour . the result is shown in figure [ fig : fg6 ] .",

    "the figure shows a similar behaviour to the corresponding plot in the reference @xcite , that is , the @xmath0-values monotonically decrease as @xmath64 increases and they converge to @xmath67 beyond @xmath68 . this result might be a justification to conclude that our boids simulations having appropriate weight vectors @xmath59 actually simulate a _ realistic _ flock .",
    "in this paper , we showed that the anisotropy observed in the empirical data analysis @xcite also emerges in our boids simulations having appropriate weight vectors @xmath59 . from the @xmath0-value we calculated",
    ", one can judge wheter an optional aggregation behaves like a _ real flock _ or not .",
    "the system of flocks is spatially ` symmetric ' for @xmath69 , whereas the symmetry is ` spontaneously ' broken for @xmath22 .",
    "we found from the behaviour of ` order parameter ' @xmath0 that this ` spontaneous symmetry breaking ' is nothing but the emergence of anisotropy .    as well - known , there are some conjectures on the origin of the emergence of anisotropy .",
    "for instance , the effect of bird s vision is one of the dominant hypotheses .",
    "in fact , real starlings have lateral visual axes and each of the starlings has a blind rear sector @xcite .",
    "if all individuals in the flock move to avoid their nearest neighbours which are hidden in their blind sectors , the effect of the blind sector is more likely to be a factor to emerge the anisotropy of nearest neighbours in the front - rear directions .",
    "however , our result proved that this hypothesis is _ not always correct _ because agents in our simulation have no blind sector of their views .",
    "nevertheless , we found that our flock aggregation has an anisotropy of the nearest neighbours .",
    "the result means that the agent s blind as an effect of vision is _ not necessarily required _ to produce the anisotropy and much more essential factor for the anisotropy is _ the best possible combinations of three essential interactions _ in the boids .",
