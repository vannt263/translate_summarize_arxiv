    "recent very precise mass measurements for two compact objects , psr j1614 - 2230 and psr j0348 + 0432 with @xmath0 @xcite and @xmath1 @xcite , respectively , where @xmath2 is the solar mass , have provided an important and reliable way to constrain the interior composition of neutron stars .",
    "these high mass values imply that the equation of state ( eos ) of the corresponding stellar medium should be rather stiff at high densities .    on the other hand , in the highly dense cores of compact objects , the neutron - rich matter can give rise to more degrees of freedom , like hyperons , and perhaps even transitioning to a quark matter phase ( see @xcite for review ) .",
    "given that cold strange quark matter has been argued to be absolutely stable @xcite , a phase transition could occur in the core of a compact star that would quickly favor quark matter in all its interior , thus giving rise to a strange star .",
    "although it has been known for more than a decade that perturbative qcd predicts maximum stellar masses for strange stars larger than 2@xmath2 @xcite , there were claims @xcite , already from the first indications of the existence of 2@xmath2 stars @xcite , that quark matter might have to be ruled out as a possible core phase .",
    "one reason was that the density of compact stars is not expected to be sufficiently high to validate a perturbative approach of the strong interaction .",
    "on the other hand , nonperturbative calculations based on simple qcd phenomenological models like the njl with a four - fermion quark - antiquark channel , were found to render a too soft eos , incapable to stabilize a 2@xmath2 star against the gravitational collapse ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "however , when other interactions , which are always present in a dense medium of quarks @xcite , such as those corresponding to the diquark channel @xcite and/or the vector channel , are taken into account , the eos can become stiff enough .",
    "because of these findings , quark matter was back in the competition as a possible core phase of massive stars ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "one may wonder if this last conclusion could be challenged in turn by other effects that might be part of the complicated physics of super dense quark matter .",
    "both , weakly coupled qcd and njl models inspired on the one - gluon exchange interaction of qcd have predicted that the most favored phase of color superconductivity at asymptotically large densities is the color - flavor - locked ( cfl ) phase @xcite . in the case of the njl approach ,",
    "the lack of confinement of this model is reflected in the introduction of an undetermined vacuum contribution to the eos that enters as an independent parameter in the form of a bag constant .",
    "moreover , in this approach , gluons degrees of freedom are usually disregarded as negligible at zero temperature . nevertheless , as discussed in the present paper , gluons can affect the eos of the cfl phase .",
    "the reason is connected to the fact that the polarization effects of quarks in the cfl background embed all the gluons with debye ( @xmath3 ) and meissner ( @xmath4 ) masses that depend on the chemical potential @xmath5 @xcite , @xmath6 as a consequence , the gluons in the cfl phase acquire nonzero rest energies that yield to a positive contribution to the system s energy density and thus to a negative contribution to the pressure , thereby softening the eos . in ( [ masses ] ) , @xmath7 is the number of flavors of massless quarks , and @xmath8 the quark - gluon gauge coupling constant .    the main goal of this paper is to investigate the gluon s effects on the eos and mass - radius ( m - r ) relationship of quark stars with cfl color superconductivity using a gauged njl model . we will show that the contribution of the gluon rest energy to the cfl thermodynamic potential softens the eos and requires a relatively high value of the vector interaction if the observed 2@xmath2 masses for this class of compact objects is to be reached .    the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , the gauged - njl model is introduced and its one - loop thermodynamic potential in the hard - loop approximation is found . in sec .",
    "iii , we investigate the eos of quark matter in the cfl phase , with and without gluon contributions , for different values of the vector interaction coupling .",
    "then , in sec .",
    "iv , the m - r relationships for compact stars having quarks in the cfl phase , with and without gluon contributions , are graphically obtained for a suitable range of parameters and the implications of the results are discussed . in sec .",
    "v , the main conclusions derived from the paper outcomes are listed .",

    "this last interaction naturally appears after a fierz transformation of a point - like four - fermion interaction with the lorentz symmetry broken by the finite density @xcite .",
    "we neglect the current quark masses @xmath20 since our main interest is to explore the stable cfl phase , which can only exist in the density region where @xmath21 . in this way",
    ", we avoid the chromomagnetic instabilities of the gcfl phase @xcite .",
    "thus , our results are valid in the density domain where the contribution @xmath22 to the eos is more important than that of the s - quark mass .",
    "hence , it is consistent to neglect @xmath23 in our calculations . to open the door to possible @xmath23 effects relevant at lower densities , the stable ground state that removes the chromomagnetic instability at those densities would have to be determined first , a problem out of the scope of this paper . despite several propositions @xcite-@xcite ,",

    "the model ( [ lagrangian ] ) is nonrenormalizable due to the four - fermion interaction terms , so a cutoff @xmath34 needs to be introduced in all the calculations to regularize the theory in the ultraviolet region .",

    "then , we can use that the chiral condensate has already vanished and hence consider only the expectation values for the diquark condensate @xmath35 and the baryon charge density @xmath36 .",
    "one can now bozonize the four - fermion interaction via a hubbard - stratonovich transformation and then take the mean - field approximation to obtain the mean - field lagrangian    @xmath37    where @xmath38 .    the partition function in the mean - field approximation",
    "is then given by @xmath39    even though the mean - field lagrangian ( [ mf - lagrangian ] ) is quadratic in the fermion fields , the presence of fermion - fermion terms does not allow to use the conventional formula to integrate in the fermion fields .",

    "for that , we rewrite @xmath40 in terms of @xmath41 and its charge conjugate @xmath42 , with @xmath43 the charge operator , and introduce ng spinors @xmath44    now we can transform to euclidean variables and consider a space with volume @xmath45 and euclidean time of length @xmath46 , to obtain the finite - temperature , mean - field partition function @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the ng action with @xmath49 the inverse ng fermion propagator in the color superconducting medium . notice that @xmath50 depends on the gluon field through the covariant derivative .",

    "combining all the contributions , we obtain that the zero - temperature , mean - field thermodynamic potential of model ( [ lagrangian ] ) in the hard - loop approximation is given by @xmath97 where we subtracted the vacuum constant @xmath98 .",

    "this result can be derived following the same calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite to find the quantum - statistical average of the energy - momentum tensor component @xmath121 , using for the present case the mean - field lagrangian ( [ mf - lagrangian ] ) .    in ( [ energy ] )",

    "following this dynamical approach , we have that the bag constant is given in our model by    @xmath125 + 4k\\langle\\overline{\\psi}_u \\psi_u \\rangle\\langle\\overline{\\psi}_d \\psi_d \\rangle\\langle\\overline{\\psi}_s \\psi_s \\rangle\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath126 is the dynamical quark masses , the quark condensates for the different flavors are given by @xmath127 with @xmath128 being the fermi momenta depending on the densities of each flavor @xmath129 ; and the dynamical masses are found from the gap equations @xmath130 where @xmath131 take values in the flavor set @xmath132 .    the vacuum bag constant in ( [ energy ] ) is given by @xmath133    for the densities we are considering in the cfl phase ( @xmath134 ) , the phase transition to the restored chiral phase ( with @xmath135 ) already took place .",

    "we call attention that due to the lack of confinement in the njl model , the contribution of the confined vacuum to the pressure and energy density can not be consistently derived in the framework of this model , what always result in certain degree of ambiguity in the proposed value for the bag constant",
    ".      the first thing we need to elucidate is what is the range of parameters that ensures absolute stability of the quark matter phase here considered .",
    "absolute stability of the strange matter exists as long as the matter energy per baryon number at zero pressure @xmath141 remains below the corresponding value for the iron nucleus ( roughly 930 mev ) . here",
    "@xmath142 is the value of the chemical potential at zero pressure . when the parameters are such that @xmath143 , the deconfinement of nuclear matter into this phase of strange matter is energetically favored . in ( [ e / a ] ) we took into account the relation between the baryon and quark number densities @xmath144 .        fig .",
    "[ figstab ] shows the behavior of @xmath145 with the vector coupling @xmath19 for the cfl matter with and without gluons .",
    "the variation of the energy per baryon with the vector interaction at zero pressure is very smooth .",
    "this is expected because of the pressure normalization at low density , so the stability of the cfl matter is little affected by @xmath19 .",
    "the effect of gluons on the energy per baryon number at zero pressure will depend on how much it lowers the pressure at a given density . if the effect were big enough to shift the zero pressure point to high values of quark density ( high @xmath5 ) , the last term in eq .",
    "( [ e / a ] ) would push the energy up and destabilize the system .",
    "nevertheless , the presence of gluons ( dashed line ) shifts the zero pressure point to a higher value of the density but not high enough as to take the system out of the absolute stability region .",
    "this shift being small , the zero pressure point is now closer to the minimum that usually exists in the energy vs. density curve , leading to a slightly lower energy per baryon number than without the gluons .",
    "[ figeos ] displays the eos for a range of @xmath19 with and without the gluons contribution to the thermodynamic potential .",
    "the inclusion of gluons degrees of freedom soften the eos , as can be seen by comparing the two panels .",
    "only relatively high values of @xmath19 can make the eos of the cfl matter with gluons stiffer than the eos of the regular cfl matter with no gluons and no vector coupling , at least in the energy density region relevant for compact stars .",
    "of course , if we compare the curve for the cfl matter at certain value of @xmath19 with the corresponding one including gluons and the same coupling value , the former will be stiffer than the second one , independent of the @xmath19 value .",
    "we can also note how the shift in pressure due to a change in @xmath19 for cfl matter with gluons for the same value of energy density increases with the increase of the energy density . while at energy densities smaller than @xmath146 mev/@xmath140 there is a negligible change even for @xmath147 , at @xmath148 mev/@xmath140 , the jump in pressure is really noticeable .",

    "a nonrelativistic gas of nuclear matter has a very small speed of sound .",
    "the opposite extreme , an ultrarelativistic gas of free particles , has @xmath152 , and adding perturbative interactions or masses just leads to @xmath153 @xcite . based on these facts , it has been speculated that for the range of intermediate densities meaningful for neutron stars , the speed of sound should lie somewhere between the values of these two extremes .",
    "these facts have led to conjecture the existence of a fundamental bound @xmath154 for the speed of sound of strongly interacting quark matter systems . however , as has been recently argued @xcite , this bound seems hard to be reconciled with the observation of neutron stars with @xmath155 , at least for hybrid stars with all the reasonable low density eos .    )",

    "[ soundsp ] the sound speed is plotted as a function of the baryon density for cfl matter without gluons ( left panel ) and with gluons ( right panel ) .",
    "the sound speed is very sensitive to the presence of the vector interactions , as can be seen from the slopes of the curves in two panels of fig .",
    "[ soundsp ] . since the gluons have debye and meissner masses in the cfl phase , their presence tends to decrease the speed of sound for each given density and coupling @xmath19 .",
    "as expected , a vector interaction tends to increase the speed since it hardens the eos .",
    "notice that despite the softening of the eos by the gluons , the condition @xmath153 is violated for all the vector interactions compatible with the absolute stability .",
    "an immediate application of the eos just derived is to use it to construct stellar models of compact stars . in this regard , there are two distinct possibilities : the formation of strange stars with the strange quark matter in the cfl phase described by the eos ( [ energy ] ) , where the parameters are chosen to ensure absolute stability ; or the formation of hybrid stars , on which the quark phase can be metastable , so the star can not be all made of quark matter but it can exist in a core that is surrounded by nuclear matter . given the results of fig .",
    "[ figstab ] we are going to investigate the first possibility . with this aim ,",

    "then , the absence of the vector interaction would be preferable in the high density region .",

    "we underline that while the energy eigenvalue @xmath165 is always allowed in the partition function of non - relativistic bosons in a big box with periodic boundary conditions , so at zero temperature these particles always occupy the zero energy ground state with zero momentum , and hence zero pressure , things are very different for relativistic bosons . in the relativistic case , if the bosons have nonzero rest energy , they produce a positive contribution to the energy density and a negative term in the pressure .",
    "since gluons in the color superconductor acquire rest energy due to their density - dependent debye and meissner masses ( [ masses ] ) , these energies affect the eos of the cfl matter at @xmath166 , thereby giving rise to all the interesting effects discussed in this paper .",

    "<S> compact astrophysical objects are a window for the study of strongly interacting nuclear matter given the conditions in their interiors , which are not reproduced in a laboratory environment . </S>",
    "<S> much has been debated about their composition with possibilities ranging from a simple mixture of mostly protons and neutrons to deconfined quark matter . </S>",
    "<S> recent observations on the mass of two pulsars , psr j1614 - 2230 and psr j0348 + 0432 , have posed a great restriction on their composition , since the equation of state must be hard enough to support masses of about at least two solar masses . </S>",
    "<S> the onset of quarks tends to soften the equation of state , but it can get substantially stiffer since in the high - dense medium a repulsive vector interaction channel is opened . nevertheless , we show that once gluon effects are considered , the equation of state of strange stars formed by quark matter in the color - flavor - locked ( cfl ) phase of color superconductivity becomes softer decreasing the maximum stellar mass that can be reached . </S>",
    "<S> this may indicate that strange stars made entirely of cfl matter can only be favored if other interactions , as the one corresponding to the vector channel , are taken into consideration and are large enough . </S>"
