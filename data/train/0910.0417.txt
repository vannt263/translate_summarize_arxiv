    "progress in quantum information processing ( qip ) requires a complete and coherent control of the dynamics of a quantum bit ( spin @xmath1 ) coupled to an environment ( bath ) .",
    "in particular , one must be able to realize the no - operation reliably and coherently for long - time storage of quantum memory .",
    "hence decoherence must be suppressed .",
    "the most general decoherence consists of both transversal dephasing and longitudinal relaxation , i.e. , the decoherence rates @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively , in nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) language .    so far , only models without explicit time dependence have been considered to our knowledge .",
    "the terms in the hamiltonian @xmath4 without coherent control ( we will call this hamiltonian henceforth the initial one ) do not have any explicit dependence on the time . for such a model techniques of various degrees of sophistication",
    "exist to suppress the dephasing and/or the relaxation @xcite .",
    "we concentrate here on the dynamical decoupling ( dd ) @xcite which generalizes the original ideas on spin echo techniques to open systems and their application to qip @xcite .",
    "intuitively , the interaction between spin ( qubit ) and bath is averaged to zero by means of repetitive @xmath0 pulses .",
    "each pulse rotates the spin by an angle @xmath0 about a spin axis @xmath5 , thus inverting its components perpendicular to @xmath5 .",
    "a particularly efficient way to suppress pure dephasing is the optimized dd ( uhrig dd ) @xcite where the instants @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) at which @xmath8 instantaneous @xmath0 pulses are applied are given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the total time of the sequence and @xmath11 by efficient suppression it is meant that each pulse helps to suppress dephasing in one additional order in an expansion in @xmath10 , i.e. , @xmath8 pulses reduce dephasing to @xmath12 .",
    "the existence of an expansion in powers of @xmath10 , at least as an asymptotic expansion , is a necessary assumption .",
    "so far , the derivation of the properties of udd as defined in eq .   was given for time independent initial hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "the present study extends this derivation to initial hamiltonians including an analytic time dependence .",
    "this extension is a breakthrough because it establishes the applicability of optimized dd for effective hamiltonians in special reference frames , e.g. , rotating frames , which induce an _",
    "explicit _ time dependence .",
    "such situations arise also where fast modes are treated in the interaction picture , are averaged over , or integrated out so that time dependent actions result and these actions are sufficiently smooth in time .",
    "the condition on smoothness need not always be fulfilled .",
    "another important application of udd for time dependent hamiltonians is the suppression of general decoherence by the application of @xmath0 pulses around two perpendicular spin axes on two hierarchical levels . if udd worked only for time independent initial hamiltonians the only known solution for the secondary level would be concatenation of primary udd sequences @xcite .",
    "but recent numerical data by west _ et al . _ showed that also the suppression on the secondary level can be efficiently realized by udd @xcite .",
    "they called the scheme quadratic dd ( qdd ) . hence the derivation below",
    "provides the analytic foundation for the applicability of qdd .    for the sake of simplicity , we first give the extended derivation for pure dephasing , addressing longitudinal relaxation in a second step .",
    "then the applications are discussed again and we provide an explicit derivation of the time dependence of the effective hamiltonian after the primary application of udd .",
    "we consider the explicitly time dependent hamiltonian @xmath13 is studied where the time dependences of the bath hamiltonian @xmath14 and of the coupling operator @xmath15 are required to be analytic , i.e. , they can be expanded in @xmath16 . if the system described by is subject to @xmath8 instantaneous @xmath0 pulses at the instants @xmath17 about a spin axis perpendicular to the @xmath18-axis the effective hamiltonian @xmath19 in the basis of unflipped spins reads @xmath20 where the switching function @xmath21 appears which changes sign at the instants @xmath22 .",
    "we are interested in the time evolution operator @xmath23 induced by @xmath19    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the time - ordering operator .",
    "the second line is based on the interaction picture with respect to @xmath14    @xmath26    the key observation is that @xmath27 is analytic as well because @xmath14 is analytic according to our requirement , and thus @xmath28 , and @xmath15 again according to our requirement .",
    "thus we have @xmath29 to be precise , to exclude any terms up to a given order @xmath8 we only need that @xmath27 can be represented by the sum in up to @xmath30 plus a residual function of higher order , i.e. , the convergence of the taylor series is not needed . in general ,",
    "the operators @xmath31 are complicated integral expressions of the operators in .    next , the time evolution @xmath32 is expanded according to standard time dependent perturbation theory    @xmath33    our aim is to show that the powers with @xmath34 odd are of order @xmath35 because only the odd powers in @xmath36 affect the qubit spin .",
    "hence we can follow the reasoning of yang and liu @xcite from here on . in order to keep the present communication self - contained",
    "we include the main steps .",
    "first , we expand in powers of @xmath10 by inserting into @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 and @xmath40 we used the dimensionless relative times @xmath41 . since the @xmath8 switching instants are given by @xmath42 the function @xmath43 does not depend on @xmath10 for given @xmath44 .",
    "hence the coefficients @xmath45 do not depend on @xmath10 .",
    "our goal is to show that @xmath45 vanishes for @xmath34 odd and @xmath46 .",
    "based on the udd choice for the @xmath47 in the substitution @xmath48 suggests itself because it renders @xmath49 particularly simple if the @xmath47 are chosen according to .",
    "then @xmath50 holds for @xmath51 with @xmath52 .",
    "if we release this contraint on @xmath53 allowing @xmath54 the function @xmath55 becomes an odd function with antiperiod @xmath56 .",
    "thus its fourier series @xmath57 contains only harmonics @xmath58 with @xmath59 an odd multiple of @xmath60 .",
    "the precise coefficients @xmath61 do not matter which can be exploited for other purposes , e.g. , to deal with pulses of finite duration @xcite .    under the substitution @xmath48 the terms @xmath62 in become @xmath63 which can be reexpressed as suitably weighted sum over terms @xmath64 with @xmath65 .",
    "thus we achieve our goal if we can show that the coefficients @xmath66 vanish for @xmath34 odd and @xmath67 .",
    "these coefficients are split up further by inserting the fourier series for @xmath55 consisting of terms @xmath58 ( @xmath59 odd multiple of @xmath60 ) .",
    "twice the product of two sine functions is the difference of two cosines whose arguments are sum and difference of the sine arguments .",
    "thus we want to show @xmath68 where @xmath69 is an odd multiple of @xmath60 and @xmath70 it is easy to perform the first two integrations in @xmath71 analytically yielding a lengthy sum over terms of the form @xmath72 where @xmath73 is still an odd multiple of @xmath60 and @xmath74 .",
    "hence the structure of the expression on the r.h.s .  of is preserved , but @xmath34 is lowered by two .",
    "this procedure is iterated till @xmath75 and we arrive at @xmath76 because @xmath77 is an odd multiple of @xmath60 and @xmath78 , thus @xmath79 .",
    "this concludes the derivation .",
    "the above derivation holds also for the odd powers of longitudinal relaxation as observed for constant hamiltonians before @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian studied is @xmath80 where    [ dd ] @xmath81    the @xmath0 pulses are applied around the spin @xmath18 axis so that the switching function appears for @xmath82 , i.e. , @xmath83 .",
    "then all the above steps for dephasing can be repeated identically on substituting @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "thus we know that the udd sequence of @xmath8 pulses makes all odd powers up to @xmath8 in @xmath82 vanish .",
    "thus it efficiently suppresses longitudinal relaxation also for time dependent hamiltonians .",
    "the first application , of course , is the use of the udd for hamiltonians in a certain reference frames which imply that the hamiltonians are effective ones with some time dependence .",
    "examples are a rotating frame , in which a magnetic field is not fully compensated , or an effective hamiltonian in which fast modes have been averaged by the help of magnus expansions or they are treated in an interaction picture . in the cases , where the resulting time dependence can be considered to be sufficiently smooth ( which need not be always true ) the previous results establish the applicability of the optimized sequence udd , in spite of the time dependence of the hamiltonian .    the second application concerns dynamic decoupling for general decoherence .",
    "the nesting of pulse sequences about perpendicular spin axes makes it possible to eliminate all possible couplings between a qubit and its environment provided the expansion in time is possible , see fig .",
    "[ fig : nesting ] . a first proposal used iterative concatenation ( cdd ) without optimization leading to a fast growing number of pulses proportional to @xmath86 if terms up to @xmath87 should be eliminated @xcite . if one uses concatenation on the secondary level , but optimized udd on the primary level ( i.e.  cudd ) the number of pulses grows only like @xmath88 improving by a square root @xcite . on the primary level",
    ", cudd suppresses longitudinal relaxation by @xmath89 @xmath0 pulses about the @xmath18 axis such that the time evolution due to a hamiltonian @xmath90 ( for @xmath91 see ( [ dd ] ) ) without explicit time dependence is reduced to the time evolution due to an effective hamiltonian @xmath92 up to correction of the order @xmath93 . for a discussion of the smoothness of @xmath94",
    "we refer the reader to the appendix .",
    "the time dependence of @xmath94 was seen previously as the decisive obstacle to apply an optimized udd sequence again on the secondary level @xcite .",
    "below we show explicitly that @xmath95 is indeed time dependent .",
    "very recent numerical data @xcite , however , indicates that the use of a udd sequence also on the secondary level with pulses about @xmath96 is in fact a very efficient way to suppress general decoherence .",
    "this nesting of two perpendicular udd sequences of @xmath89 @xmath0 pulses about @xmath18 for each of the @xmath97 intervals of a udd sequence of @xmath98 @xmath0 pulses about a perpendicular axis is called quadratic dynamic decoupling ( qdd ) @xcite highlighting the case @xmath99 .",
    "this choice is advantageous if longitudinal relaxation and dephasing are of similar magnitude .",
    "the above derivation of the udd as optimized sequence for dephasing and longitudinal relaxation for _ time dependent _ hamiltonians provides the analytic foundation of the qdd proposed by west _",
    "_ @xcite . in spite of the time dependence that the effective hamiltonian @xmath94 acquires under the primary udd ( suppressing longitudinal relaxation up to @xmath100 ) the secondary udd ( suppressing dephasing up to @xmath101 ) will still work to the desired order given by the number of pulses .",
    "the reason is that an analytic time dependence , quite surprisingly , does not spoil the analytic properties of the optimized udd sequences .",
