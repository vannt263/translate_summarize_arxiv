    "a cosmic far - infrared background ( cib ) that would trace the peak of the star  formation and metal production in galaxy assembly has long been predicted .",
    "the first observational evidence for such a background was reported by puget et al .",
    "( 1996 ) ( see hauser & dwek 2001 , for a review ) .",
    "this discovery , together with recent cosmological surveys in the infrared ( ir ) and submillimeter , has opened new perspectives on our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "the surprisingly large amount of energy in the cib shows that it is crucial to probe the galaxies contributing to it to understand when and how the bulk of stars formed in the universe .",
    "+ to understand the sources contributing to the cib and to interpret the deep source counts , we have developed a phenomenological model that constrains in a simple way the ir luminosity function evolution with redshift , and fits all the existing source counts consistent with the redshift distribution , the cib intensity , and , for the first time , the cib fluctuation observations from the mid - ir to the submm range ( lagache et al . 2003 ) . _",
    "spitzer _ has provided deep new multiwavelength source counts from 24 to 160 @xmath7 ( papovich et al .",
    "2004 , dole et al .",
    "we use these new data to search for a new optimisation of the lagache et al .",
    "( 2003 ) model parameters .",
    "a remarkable result is that only a minor change of the co - moving luminosity density distribution combined with a slight modification of the starburst model spectra , mainly for the 12 @xmath830  @xmath0 m range , are required to fit all the previous data together with the new constraints .",
    "the model is discussed extensively in lagache et al . ( 2003 ) .",
    "our goal is to build the simplest model with the fewest free parameters and separate ingredients .",
    "we fix the cosmology to @xmath9=0.7 , @xmath10=0.3 and h=0.65 .",
    "we assume that ir galaxies are mostly powered by star formation and hence we use spectral energy distributions ( seds ) typical of star - forming galaxies .",
    "although some of the galaxies will have agn - dominated seds , they are a small enough fraction ( @xmath11 10% : alonso herrero et al .",
    "2004 ) that they do not affect the results significantly .",
    "we therefore construct normal and starburst galaxy template seds : a single form of sed is associated with each activity type and luminosity .",
    "we assume that the luminosity function ( lf ) is represented by these two activity types and that they evolve independently .",
    "we search for the form of evolution that best reproduces the existing data .",
    "the new optimisation of the model parameters reproduces : ( i ) the number counts at 15 , 24 , 60 , 70 , 90 , 160 , 170 , and 850  @xmath0 m , ( ii ) the known redshift distributions ( mainly at 15 and 170  @xmath0 m ) , ( iii ) the local luminosity functions at 60 and 850  @xmath0 m , ( iv ) the cib ( from 100 to 1000  @xmath0 m ) and its fluctuations ( at 60 , 100 and 170  @xmath0 m ) . +",
    "compared with the form of the model derived by lagache et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , only a slight change of the co - moving luminosity density distribution is required ( fig .",
    "[ phi ] ) , together with minor modifications to the starburst template spectra mainly between 12 and 30  @xmath0 m ( fig .",
    "[ spectrum ] ) .",
    "the modified starburst spectra still reproduce the color diagrams of soifer & neugeubauer 1991 ( 12/25 versus 60/100 ) .",
    "we do not modify any other parameters in the model , nor the sed of the normal galaxy template nor the sed of the starburst galaxy templates at longer wavelengths , nor the parametrisation of the local lf .",
    "+ pahs radiate about 10@xmath3 of the 1 - 1000  @xmath0 m luminosity in a set of features concentrated mostly between 6 and 15  @xmath0 m ( fig .",
    "[ spectrum ] ) .",
    "this set of features is the strongest spectral concentration known in galaxy spectra .",
    "the features affect strongly the mid - ir number counts when the redshift brings them into the bandpass filter .",
    "for the 15  @xmath0 m isocam observations , the peak contribution arises when the 7.7  @xmath0 m maximum is close to the middle of the band i.e. z@xmath20.8 . the isocam 15  @xmath0 m counts showed the existence of a maximum in the redshift distribution just at that redshift .",
    "futhermore , it leads to a maximum in the counts ( normalised to the euclidian , e.g. on fig .",
    "[ number_counts1 ] ) , which can exist only when the ir energy output in the critical redshift range is dominated by a well defined luminosity range . our model predicted a similar behaviour for the 24  @xmath0 m band .",
    "llccc 1 @xmath12 & 8.0 @xmath0jy & 0.47 mjy & 10.6 mjy + @xmath13 & * 56 @xmath0jy * & * 3.2 mjy * & * 39.8 mjy * + q & 7.0 & 6.8 & 3.8 +",

    "24  @xmath0 m ( papovich et al . 2004 ) , 70 and 160  @xmath0 m ( dole et al .",
    "2004a ) counts in fig .  [ number_counts1 ] and fig .  [ number_counts2 ] .",
    "the updated model reproduces very well the counts at 15 and 24  @xmath0 m without any significant changes in the other number counts , as well as the cib and its fluctuations and the redshift distributions of resolved sources at 15 , 60 , 170 and 850  @xmath0 m .",
    "the agreement between the observed counts and the model at 24  @xmath0 m is excellent .",
    "the consistency of the model from the mid - ir and far - ir to the submm indicates that the underlying assumptions are valid up to redshift 2.5 .",
    "in particular , the very close agreement between the model and number counts at 15 and 24  @xmath0 m implies that the pah features remain prominent in the redshift range 0.5 to 2.5 .",
    "furthermore , the well - defined bump in the 24  @xmath0 m number counts ( normalised to the euclidian ) at s@xmath140.3 mjy ( fig . [ number_counts2 ] ) implies at z@xmath142 that l@xmath15= 3.2 10@xmath4  l@xmath5 which corresponds to l@xmath16=3.5 10@xmath6  l@xmath5 .",
    "these luminosities have to dominate the ir energy ouput at that redshift ( as shown on fig . [ lf ] ) . as a comparison ,",
    "an ir energy output dominated by l@xmath17 galaxies at z@xmath142 would maximise the 24  @xmath0 m counts around 3  @xmath0jy which is totally inconsistent with the observation since most of the cib at 24  @xmath0 m is resolved at flux densities brighter than @xmath260  @xmath0jy .    using the new model of ir galaxy evolution , dole et al .",

    "+ in fig  [ 24mic ] , we show the different redshift contributions to the 24  @xmath0 m number counts .",
    "the peak in the counts is dominated by galaxies with redshift between 1 and 2 .",
    "there is also a non negligible contribution from @xmath192 galaxies ( 30@xmath3 at s=0.2 mjy ) .",
    "the integral of the source counts down to 60  @xmath20jy gives 1.9 nw m@xmath21 sr@xmath22 , in excellent agreement with papovich et al .",
    "it represents about 63@xmath3 of the cib at 24  @xmath0 m .",
    "it should also be noted from fig .",
    "[ 24mic ] that the redshift distribution changes sharply for fluxes between 0.3 and 2 mjy . for sources weaker than 150  @xmath0jy ,",
    "the redshift distribution remains about constant .",
    "we have updated the model of lagache et al . ( 2003 ) to fit the new constraints from _ spitzer",
    "we show that only a small change of the co - moving luminosity density distribution and of the starburst template spectra are required to fit all the observations from the mid - ir to the sub - millimeter .",
    "the agreement between the model and all the data demonstrates that the integrated seds from galaxies still have prominent 6 - 9 @xmath0 m emission from pah features up to redshift 2.5 .",
    "it clearly shows that the population of ir galaxies is not dominated by galaxies with featureless continuum spectra ( such as agn - type seds in the mid - ir ) .",
    "the fraction of the energy radiated by the pahs is about one tenth of the total ir radiation locally and remains roughly constant between redshifts 0.5 and 2.5 .",
    "+ our initial model predicted that the ir output energy had to be dominated by galaxies with luminosities increasing rapidly with redshift ( l@xmath16@xmath14 3 10@xmath6  l@xmath5 at z=2.5 ) .",
    "this was needed mainly to account for the scuba counts ( the total energy ouput at that redshift being mostly driven by the submillimeter extragalactic background level ) .",
    "the excellent agreement between the 24  @xmath0 m counts and the model confirms strikingly the evolution of the ir luminosity function as being dominated in energy by @xmath23 10@xmath4  l@xmath5 to @xmath23 10@xmath6  l@xmath5 galaxies from redshift 0.5 to 2.5 .",
    "+ we have for the first time with _ spitzer _ an unbiased view of the ir universe up to redshift 2.5 . with all the mid - ir to sub - mm data ,",
