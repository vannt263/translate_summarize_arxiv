    "previous measurements of black hole ( bh ) x - ray transients in quiescence show that the bh systems have x - ray luminosities ranging from @xmath6 to @xmath7 erg  s@xmath3 @xcite . as in outburst",
    ", there is evidence for the presence of an accretion disk in quiescence @xcite , but the accretion rate onto the bh itself is unclear as is the nature of the accretion flow . although there is currently no consensus on the origin of the quiescent x - ray emission , three emission sites are considered to be viable for at least some systems : the accretion disk ; the putative outflow or jet ; and the secondary star .",
    "one picture for the quiescent accretion flow is that of an inner quasi - spherical and optically thin region surrounded by a optically thick disk as in the advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) model @xcite .",
    "this model explains the faintness of quiescent bhs as being due to advection of radiation across the bh event horizon @xcite .",
    "however , it has been determined that adafs are convectively unstable for certain viscosity ranges , leading to convection - dominated accretion flows ( cdaf , quataert & gruzinov 2000 ) .",
    "such a model can explain the low bh luminosities without the need for advection across an event horizon .",
    "in addition , bh advection may not be necessary if outflows or jets transport the accretion energy out of the system @xcite .",
    "there is evidence for the presence of compact radio jets from bh systems at low x - ray luminosities @xcite , and these may persist in quiescence .",
    "such jets may possibly contribute to the x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "finally , @xcite suggested the secondary as an x - ray emission site , but we note that this possibility has been ruled out for most systems @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we describe results of observations of the bh transients v4641  sgr and xte j1859 + 226 in quiescence made using the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ @xcite .",
    "these systems both had major x - ray outbursts in 1999 @xcite .",
    "while the xte j1859 + 226 outburst was typical of bh transients , the behavior of v4641  sgr was unusual with a long period of low level activity punctuated by a 12 crab flare lasting 1 - 2 days . from optical observations covering the 67.6 hr v4641  sgr orbit and the ( likely ) 9.16 hr xte j1859 + 226 orbit ,",
    "the compact object masses are above 3 , indicating that these systems contain bhs @xcite . at the time of the outburst",
    ", v4641  sgr exhibited a one - sided , rapidly evolving , relativistic radio jet @xcite , and there is evidence that xte j1859 + 226 also produced a radio jet @xcite .",
    "the main motivations of our _ chandra _ observations are to study the bhs in quiescence and to search for large - scale x - ray jets like those detected for xte j1550564 @xcite and 4u 1755338 @xcite . here",
    ", we report on the detection of the bhs in quiescence , and we will report on the x - ray jet search and the consequences of the non - detection of those jets in a future paper .",
    "we obtained 2 _ chandra _ observations of v4641  sgr in 2002 : a 4.3 ks observation on ut august 5 ( obs .",
    "1a ) ; and a 25.3 ks observation on ut october 21 ( obs .",
    "for both observations , we used the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) in imaging mode , and the target was placed on one of the back - illuminated acis chips ( s3 ) .",
    "observation 1a was carried out under director s discretionary time and was prompted by x - ray , optical , and radio activity from the source during 2002 may and june @xcite .",
    "considering the possibility that the source might still be active in x - rays during observation 1a , we used a 1/4 ccd subarray to mitigate photon pileup effects .",
    "we found that the source was not bright @xcite , and we used the full ccd for observation 1b .",
    "we also obtained a 24.8 ks _",
    "observation of xte j1859 + 226 on 2003 february 5 ( obs .",
    "2 ) using acis in imaging mode .",
    "the last known x - ray activity from xte j1859 + 226 was in 2000 @xcite .",
    "for all 3 observations , the background levels remain low throughout , allowing us to use the full exposure time .",
    "vla ( very large array ) radio observations occurred within 1 week of observations 1a and 1b and within 2 weeks of observation 2 .",
    "v4641  sgr and xte j1859 + 226 showed no radio emission with rms noise levels near 0.1 mjy / beam at 4 and 6 cm .",
    "we produced 0.3 - 8 kev acis images using the `` level 2 '' event lists from the standard data processing .",
    "for the analysis described below , we used the ciao ( _ chandra interactive analysis of observations _ ) v2.3 software and caldb ( calibration data base ) v2.21 . to obtain the maximum sensitivity for source detection in the v4641  sgr field , we combined the data for observations 1a and 1b .",
    "we restricted our search for sources to a 2 arcmin@xmath2 region containing the position of v4641  sgr .",
    "this region , which is shown in figure  [ fig : v4641 ] , is fully covered by both observations giving a spatially uniform exposure time of 29.5 ks .",
    "we used the ciao routine `` wavdetect '' with a detection threshold of @xmath8 @xcite to search for sources in the combined image , leading to the detection of 12 sources with between 6 and 36 counts per source . a source with 9 counts ( labeled 1 in figure  [ fig : v4641 ] )",
    "is detected at a position consistent with the v4641  sgr radio position .    as the v4641  sgr radio position is known to @xmath9 @xcite",

    "as confirmed black hole systems ( based on compact object mass measurements ) , v4641  sgr and xte j1859 + 226 represent important additions to the group of bhs that have previously been detected in x - rays in quiescence . of the 15 confirmed @xcite transient bh systems , 14 now have quiescent x - ray detections or sensitive upper limits , and only grs 1915 + 105 , which has been in outburst since its discovery in 1992 , does not .",

    "the x - ray emission is thought to originate from the accretion flow , a jet , or the secondary star , and , here , we discuss how our results for v4641  sgr may constrain theoretical models for x - ray production . the v4641  sgr source distance ( 7 kpc ) along with the proper motion of the one - sided radio jet seen in 1999 ( @xmath59 per day ) indicate that the angle between the jet axis and our line of sight is @xmath608@xmath24 @xcite .",
    "thus , if the x - ray emission originates in a fast - moving jet , one expects v4641  sgr to be brighter due to relativistic beaming .",
    "however , the v4641  sgr x - ray luminosity ( assuming isotropic emission ) is similar to the luminosities of the other bh systems , for which the jet axes are either not known or are known to be relatively far from our line of sight , indicating that the x - ray emission is not highly beamed and limiting the velocity of a putative x - ray emitting jet . for a continuous synchrotron x - ray jet @xcite , it is unlikely that the bulk - motion lorentz factor could be higher than @xmath611.5 as this would cause the source to be brighter than an unbeamed source by a factor of @xmath6110 for a jet that is @xmath62 from our line of sight @xcite .",
    "this calculation assumes a spectrum with a photon index of 1.5 , which is in the range of values that can be produced within the @xcite model . assuming a photon index of 0.2 ( our best estimate for v4641  sgr ) would lead to a somewhat higher limit on the lorentz factor , but it is unclear whether such a hard spectrum could have a synchrotron origin .",
    "also , we note that the lorentz factor constraint is similar for models where x - rays are produced in jets via inverse comptonization @xcite .",
    "the v4641  sgr constraint on the lorentz factor ( @xmath631.5 ) is consistent with recent results for bh systems in the canonical low - hard state @xcite .      for accretion disk models such as the adaf model",
    ", the quiescent x - ray luminosity depends mainly on mass accretion rate rather than on system orientation .",
    "thus , the luminosities of v4641  sgr and xte j1859 + 226 would be expected to be similar to the other bh systems , as observed .",
    "if the hard v4641  sgr x - ray spectrum is confirmed and is intrinsic to the source , it would suggest that another parameter besides accretion rate is important .",
    "hard spectra can be produced by adafs @xcite and cdafs @xcite , but it is unclear why one system at close to the median luminosity would be intrinsically much harder than the others .",
    "the spectral type of the v4641  sgr secondary is b9  iii @xcite , making it the most luminous of the bh transients . in quiescence , the ratio of the x - ray to bolometric luminosity ( @xmath64 ) for v4641  sgr is @xmath61@xmath65 based on the x - ray luminosity reported here and the optical luminosity of the secondary ( orosz et al . , in prep . ) . the v4641  sgr ratio is higher than the average value but comparable to the highest values measured by _",
    "rosat _ for late b - type stars @xcite .",
    "while it is unlikely that the hard x - ray flux from v4641  sgr comes from the secondary , we can not rule out the possibility that the secondary makes a some contribution to the soft x - ray flux below @xmath612  kev",
    ". the early type secondary could also be important if it has a strong wind .",
    "the wind could collide with accretion disk material , leading to additional x - ray production , or it could cause extra x - ray absorption , explaining the hard v4641  sgr spectrum .",
