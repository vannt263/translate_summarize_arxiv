    "the discovery of topological insulators has stimulated a broad inquiry into topological features of electronic energy bands .",

    "a linear touching between two non - degenerate bands is a weyl point,@xcite and is completely robust to all perturbations which do not break translational symmetry .",
    "such weyl nodes are predicted to lead to a variety of measurable consequences , including unusual surface states whose fermi surface is open ( `` fermi arcs '' ) , unusual hall effects , and other unusual transport features , and have been studied in a number of systems.@xcite generically , weyl points require a system with strong spin - orbit coupling , and in addition the condition that the bands be non - degenerate requires that at least either inversion or time - reversal symmetry be broken.@xcite this might occur in a bulk material through magnetic order or a non - centrosymmetric crystal structure , but weyl points can also be engineered .",
    "in particular , an appropriate superlattice of alternating normal and topological insulators has been shown to display weyl points.@xcite    weyl fermions have been discussed extensively in the context of the a phase of @xmath1he , which also exhibits weyl quasiparticles .",
    "@xmath1he also supports the b phase , in which quasiparticles are fully gapped , but which nevertheless possesses interesting topological properties.@xcite in this paper , we explore the connection of weyl semimetals to weyl and topological superconductors , and more generally the effects of superconductivity on weyl semimetals .",
    "specifically we consider another class of engineered structures , in which the normal insulator of the aforementioned superlattice is replaced by a ( conventional , s - wave ) superconductor .",
    "simple arguments show that only the weyl semimetal produced by time - reversal symmetry breaking , and not the one produced by non - centrosymmetry , leads to non - trivial superconducting states . focusing on the former , we find that a variety of superconducting phases , with and without weyl points , and with varying topological features , can be tuned , depending upon the degree of time - reversal symmetry breaking and the magnitude of the superconducting proximity effect upon the topological insulating layers of the superlattice .",
    "each of these phases may be characterized in a number of ways , which we discuss in the main text . in the bulk",
    ", they may be parametrized by the number , location , and chirality of weyl points . at surfaces , depending upon both the phase and the surface orientation , one or several branches of chiral majorana states may be present , and extend over a varying range of momenta in the surface brillouin zone .",

    "the hole comprising the vortex also introduces a new edge at the sample boundary ( the circular ends of the cylindrical hole ) .",

    "@xcite we presume any bulk transport to be parallel to the gradient , so that it can be separated from the surface contribution . in any case , the dependence upon field , density , etc . of any possible bulk contribution",
    "would be very different from that of the surface one .    for concreteness ,",

    "concretely , the thermal hall conductance is proportional to the length of the system in the @xmath7 direction , @xmath168 , with @xmath169    in the @xmath112 phase , where @xmath170 , each ti layer contributes the full majorana quantum @xmath171 to the thermal hall coefficient .",
    "although thermal transport measurements are experimentally demanding , the higher dimensionality of the surface states in a weyl superconductor as compared to fractional or spin quantum hall edge states hopefully tends to result in more approachable experiments .      as discussed in sec .",

    "electric transport experiments that have been proposed for @xmath101 superconductors can simply be transferred to weyl superconductors .",
    "the general idea is to bring different samples with majorana edge modes into contact .",
    "whenever an interface has two edge modes running into the same direction , electrons can tunnel into the interface by decomposition in the two majorana particles .",
    "these two majorana particles can then be transported in parallel , giving rise to a one - directional electronic transport channel along the interface.@xcite in alternative setups , the two majoranas can be separated and recombined with different majorana modes , which leads to distinct signatures in conductance and noise.@xcite the latter experiments are however less appropriate for weyl superconductors where each surface has a large number of generically coupled majorana modes at different values of @xmath65 .",
    "we have shown how a variety of gapless and/or topological superconducting phases can be achieved in superconducting  topological insulator superlattices .",
    "these phases are analogous to quasiparticle states of @xmath1he , the most interesting @xmath112 and @xmath113 phases exhibit majorana surface states on some surfaces , and bound to the cores of vortices . particularly in the gapless phases , such as @xmath113 ,",
    "these majorana states exist only for a range of momenta , @xmath65 , along the modulated direction of the superlattice .",
    "in such a case , no local ( in @xmath139 ) description of the majorana modes is possible , as opposed to the situation in the @xmath112 phase , in which the majorana modes can be modeled in terms of a real - space tight - binding hamiltonian in the @xmath139 direction , and the state can be considered as a sort of stack of two - dimensional topological superconductors .",
    "it is hoped that the proposed structures might be explored experimentally in the future . while we do not discuss materials in any detail here",
    ", we note that recent studies have shown that cu@xmath172bi@xmath173se@xmath174@xcite becomes a superconductor with @xmath175 , while it is a topological insulator for @xmath176 , so that a superlattice with modulated @xmath157 might be a candidate realization of this proposal",
    ". some _ ab initio _ modeling of such a superlattice would probably be useful prior to any experimental attempts .",
    "alternatively , spin - triplet superconductors have recently been identified to exhibit weyl superconducting phases as well.@xcite    there is significant scope for further theoretical study of weyl and topological superconductors in three dimensions .",
    "the majorana surface states of @xmath112 and @xmath113 phases are rather analogous to the `` chiral surface sheaths '' which occur in three - dimensional quantum hall systems,@xcite where interesting vertical transport , quantum interference , and universal conductance fluctuations have been studied , and it would be interesting to see how such phenomena translate to the superconducting case .",
    "we have also not touched on the adler - bell - jackiw anomaly associated with weyl points .",
    "this has been discussed recently for normal weyl semimetals , where it may lead to anomalous magnetotransport.@xcite it is not obvious what the consequences are for weyl superconductors .",

    "in this appendix , we discuss the qualitative behavior of weyl semimetals under superconducting proximity effect .",
    "we assume that either time reversal or inversion symmetry is conserved , while the respective other symmetry needs to be broken for the system to exhibit weyl physics .",
    "as has been mentioned in the introduction , the fate of the weyl superconductor depends on which of the symmetries is conserved . for inversion symmetric , time reversal symmetry broken weyl semimetals , the presence of a weyl node at @xmath177 implies the presence of a weyl node of _ opposite _ chirality at @xmath178 . in weyl semimetals with broken inversion symmetry ,",
    "however , time reversal symmetry guarantees the presence of weyl nodes of _ equal _ chirality at @xmath179 .",
    "when a superconducting proximity effect is turned on , the low energy modes at these two weyl nodes mix",
    ". however , the superconducting correlations more precisely couple electrons on one weyl node to holes on the other , instead of electrons to electrons as a more standard perturbation would do .",
    "this effectively inverts the chirality of one of the weyl nodes .",
    "consequently , the proximity effect in inversion symmetric systems _ effectively _ mixes weyl nodes of the _ same _ chirality , and no gap opens . in time reversal symmetric systems , on the contrary ,",
    "the mixed weyl nodes effectively have _ opposite _ chiralities , and a gap is to be expected .",
    "to be more concrete , we consider the effective low energy theory of a weyl semimetal , which corresponds to electrons living close to weyl nodes . since standard superconductivity couples electrons at momenta @xmath180 , we focus our effective model on two of the weyl nodes located at momenta @xmath179 . for an inversion symmetric system ,",
    "where the nodes are of opposite chirality , this already describes a complete minimal model . for a time reversal symmetric system ,",
    "the nodes at @xmath179 have the same chirality , and there must exist at least two additional nodes , say at @xmath181 , of the respective opposite chirality . since these two pairs of nodes are decoupled , we can understand the system as two copies of the following hamiltonian describing only two weyl nodes .",
    "the latter thus allows us to decide on the presence or absence of a gap .",
    "as advertized , our result will only depend on whether the two initial weyl nodes have the same or opposite chirality .",
    "we therefore assume one weyl node to have positive chirality , @xmath182 , while the second node is so far keep in a general notation , @xmath183 in order to tackle both the time reversal symmetric and inversion symmetric cases simultaneously .",
    "the electrons close to these nodes are described by the operators @xmath184 and @xmath185 , respectively .",
    "we furthermore measure the momenta relative to the respective weyl nodes , such that the non - superconducting hamiltonian reads    @xmath186    with @xmath187 .",
    "we assume that the superconducting part of the hamiltonian only contains terms of the from    @xmath188    which in particular includes s - wave and p - wave pairing .",
    "it is now useful to rewrite the non - superconducting part of the hamiltonian as    @xmath189    where @xmath190 .",
    "we note that the sign of the second weyl node in the hamiltonian has to be reversed due to the inversion of creation and annihilation operators .",
    "this precisely corresponds to the effective inversion of the chirality of the second node under proximity effect , see above . including a general superconducting term , the full hamiltonian @xmath191 can be written as @xmath192\\\\\\left[\\alpha(\\vec{k})^*\\,\\mathds{1}_{\\sigma } + \\vec{\\beta}(\\vec{k})^*\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma}\\right]&\\mp\\,v_f\\,\\vec{\\sigma}\\cdot\\vec{k}\\end{pmatrix}\\text { .}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for an inversion symmetric system , where the lower ( plus ) sign applies , the diagonal is proportional to the unit matrix in nambu space .",
    "superconductivity can therefore never open up a gap , but only shift the bogoliobov weyl nodes in momentum space . for time reversal symmetric systems ,",
    "the hamiltonian is however generically gapped . as an example",
    ", we consider s - wave superconductivity .",
    "the latter corresponds to    @xmath193    where we neglect the superconducting phase for simplicity , i.e.  @xmath194 .",
    "the total hamiltonian then reads @xmath195 the eigenvalues of this hamiltonian are easily found as    @xmath196    and the system is gapped as expected .",
    "finally , consider adiabatically restoring inversion symmetry . throughout this process",
    ", superconductivity ensures the system to be gapped .",
    "a time reversal symmetric , inversion symmetry broken weyl superconductor can thus adiabatically be connected to the trivial state respecting both symmetries , and is therefore a trivial insulator itself .",
