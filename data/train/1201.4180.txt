    "slip - flow theory is a powerful tool that enables the continued use of the navier - stokes description as the characteristic flow lengthscale ( @xmath0 ) approaches the molecular mean free path ( @xmath1 ) @xcite .",
    "it can be rigorously derived from asymptotic solution of the boltzmann equation in the limit @xmath2 ; such an analysis shows that , in this limit , the navier - stokes description remains valid in the bulk , but fails near the boundaries @xcite .",
    "fortunately , the kinetic effects associated with the inhomogeneity introduced by the walls are only important within a layer of thickness @xmath3 near the boundaries ( known as the knudsen layer ) and can be accounted for by a boundary - layer type of analysis where an inner kinetic solution is matched to the outer navier - stokes solution @xcite .",
    "slip / jump boundary conditions and the associated _ non - adjustable _ slip coefficients emerge from this analysis as the matching condition between the inner and outer solution @xcite .",
    "carrying out such an analysis to second order in @xmath4 yields second - order slip / jump models @xcite , which can be very useful in a variety of cases @xcite .",
    "accurate determination of slip coefficients using this rigorous procedure is quite challenging in general and becomes increasingly more challenging as the order of the expansion increases .",
    "original studies focused on the bgk model of the boltzmann equation @xcite , for which all first - order and second - order coefficients are known @xcite .",
    "the first - order coefficients for the hard - sphere gas have also since been calculated @xcite . however , although the form of the slip expression is known to second order in @xmath4 , second - order slip coefficients for the hard - sphere gas are mostly unknown .    as the companion paper shows @xcite , the recently developed reciprocity relations by takata @xcite",
    "can be used to calculate these coefficients .",
    "an alternative approach amounts to extracting slip coefficients from hydrodynamic fields by comparing solutions of the boltzmann equation with navier - stokes solutions @xcite . in these approaches , in addition to high accuracy ( including low statistical uncertainty if a stochastic method is used for solving the boltzmann equation ) , care needs to be exercised to avoid comparison of the two solutions in the knudsen layer , where the navier - stokes solution is not equivalent to the boltzmann solution @xcite .",
    "this has led to a number of erroneous results in the past .",
    "in this paper we use this process to calculate the second - order temperature jump coefficient for a dilute gas when the temperature field is governed by the poisson equation with constant forcing term .",
    "we calculate this coefficient using the recently developed low - variance deviational monte carlo simulation method @xcite , which is naturally suited to low - signal problems and thus allows calculations at infinitessimal temperature differences .",
    "the latter are necessary because finite temperature differences introduce density gradients and temperature - dependent transport coefficients which may alter the result .",
    "our result is verified and put on a more firm theoretical footing by the companion paper @xcite which considers a mathematically equivalent time - dependent problem , thus clarifying why the temperature jump law and coefficient reported here are in general different from the one obtained by linear _ steady - state _",
    "analysis @xcite .",
    "we consider a dilute hard - sphere gas of molecular mass @xmath5 and molecular diameter @xmath6 , in contact with a planar diffusely reflecting boundary at temperature @xmath7 .",
    "we also consider the bgk model of such a gas , with collision frequency @xmath8 . in the case of the hard - sphere gas , @xmath9 , while for the bgk gas @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the most probable speed based on the reference temperature @xmath12 , @xmath13 is a reference number density , @xmath14 is the gas constant and @xmath15 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "the first - order temperature jump condition at the gas - wall interface is given by @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 denotes the boundary location , @xmath20 is the unit ( inward ) normal direction and @xmath0 is the characteristic system length scale ; the numerical constant @xmath21 obtains the _ non - adjustable _ values of @xmath22 for a hard sphere gas and @xmath23 for a bgk gas @xcite ; we emphasize that these values correspond to diffusely - reflecting boundaries .",
    "the utility of first - order slip / jump models primarily depends on the amount of error that can be tolerated .",
    "temperature jump coefficients ( both first - order and the second - order measured here ) turn out to be larger than their velocity slip counterparts . as a result , a second - order temperature jump correction becomes important at smaller knudsen numbers .",
    "in other words , the first - order result ( [ eq : tjump1 ] ) is typically adequate for @xmath24 .",
    "asymptotic expansion to second order in @xmath25 @xcite for _ linear and steady _ problems extends ( [ eq : tjump1 ] ) to the following jump condition @xmath26 this condition is valid for a quiescent gas  more precisely , a gas that is quiescent under no - slip boundary conditions ; in the presence of gas flow , additional terms related to the flow stress need to be included @xcite .",
    "we also emphasize that according to the analysis that yields this condition , for linear and steady problems , energy conservation reduces to @xmath27 where @xmath28 , and @xmath0 is the characteristic problem lengthscale . in the special case of one - dimensional problems , equation ( [ homo ] )",
    "further reduces to @xmath29 which makes the value of @xmath30 irrelevant .",
    "this is actually utilized below to calculate the slip coefficient due to a forcing term in the temperature equation .    in summary ,",
    "jump condition ( [ eq : tjump2 ] ) is to be used when the governing equation is ( [ homo ] ) . within this approximation ,",
    "@xmath30 is only known ( @xmath31 ) for the special case of the bgk model @xcite .",
    "we also note that deissler s result @xcite for second - order velocity slip and temperature jump is based on approximate mean - free - path arguments and does not correspond to a self - consistent solution of the boltzmann equation ; as a result , it captures neither the correct form of the slip / jump relation nor the correct values of the slip coefficients ( e.g. compare equations ( 3.40)-(3.42 ) in @xcite to equations ( 24a ) and ( 51 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "to extract the slip coefficient in a dilute gas governed by the poisson equation with constant forcing term , we simulate the steady state of a one - dimensional gas layer bounded by two isothermal , diffuse walls at @xmath32 and at temperature @xmath12 , subject to volumetric heating at a constant rate @xmath33 . in dimensionless form ,",
    "the one - dimensional heat equation with constant volumetric heating can be written as @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 is a dimensionless form of the thermal conductivity equal to @xmath37 for hard spheres and unity for bgk @xcite  and @xmath38 is the dimensionless form of the volumetric heat addition rate . here",
    ", @xmath39 is a reference pressure .",
    "the asymptotic analysis yielding ( [ eq : tjump2 ] ) does not apply to the non - homogeneous equation ( [ eq : heat ] ) .",
    "a rigorous derivation which takes the inhomogeneous term into account by considering an equivalent unsteady problem can be found in the companion paper @xcite , which shows that in a quiescent gas , in one spatial dimension , the resulting second - order slip relation is given by @xmath40 we emphasize that , although the structure of the slip relation is the same as in equation ( [ eq : tjump2 ] ) , the second - order coefficient is different .",
    "it is also convenient that ( [ eq : tjump3 ] ) does not contain @xmath30 ; this allows calculation of @xmath41 from volumetric heating calculations without explicit knoweldge of @xmath30 .",
    "this last feature , as well as the similarity of ( [ eq : tjump2 ] ) and ( [ eq : tjump3 ] ) is due to fortuitous cancellation ; as discussed further in section [ disc ] , under more general conditions ( e.g. higher spatial dimensions ) , this cancellation does not take place and terms containing both @xmath30 and @xmath41 appear .",

    "away from the knudsen layer _ allows us to calculate the coefficient @xmath41 . in this work",

    ", lvdsmc solves the boltzmann transport equation through a time - splitting approach using a timestep @xmath57 . the associated advection and collision substeps",
    "are described below .      during the advection substep , particles move according to the standard dsmc procedure ( i.e. for particle @xmath58 , @xmath59 ) , with additional particles generated at the boundaries and cell interfaces . each of these additional generation steps are implemented by drawing particles from differences of fluxal distributions .    at a stationary boundary ,",
