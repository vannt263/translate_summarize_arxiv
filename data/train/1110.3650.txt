    "set @xmath6 ; then every submultiplicative function that grows uniformly faster ( in the sense of  ) than @xmath7 is equivalent to the growth function of a group .    the growth function of a group is necessarily nondecreasing and submultiplicative ( @xmath22 ) .",

    "the changes with respect to  @xcite may be summarized as follows : instead of considering a fixed group @xmath33 , we consider a sequence of groups @xmath132 , and a dynamical system relating optimal choices of metrics on them .",

    "the optimal choice of metrics is studied via a projective dynamical system on the simplex .",

    "the first two steps together give sharp bounds on the growth of @xmath38 , see corollary  [ cor : global ] .    for theorem  [ thm : main ] ,",

    "since then , the upper bound on the growth of grigorchuk s group has been improved to @xmath153 see  @xcite ; and lower bounds of the form @xmath31 have been found , but for @xmath154 substantially lower than @xmath155 ; see  @xcite .",
    "note that previous literature often uses the notation @xmath156 .",
    "grigorchuk constructed in  @xcite*theorem  7.2 a continuum of @xmath79-groups @xmath33 of intermediate growth , for @xmath40 suitably chosen among infinite sequences over the alphabet @xmath122 .",
    "similar constructions of @xmath157-groups for any prime @xmath157 , and of torsion - free groups were given in  @xcite .",
    "he proved that many @xmath33 have nonequivalent growth functions , that their growth functions are not totally ordered , and that for every subexponentially growing function @xmath118 there exists a group whose growth function @xmath18 satisfies @xmath158 and @xmath159 .",
    "this argument was modified in  @xcite to show that for every such @xmath118 there exists a group whose growth function satisfies @xmath160 .",

    "this may be pictured in the space of marked groups  @xcite*page  71 ; the growth function is upper semi - continuous on that space .",
    "as @xmath40 begins by a longer and longer constant subword , the group @xmath33 approaches the permutational wreath product @xmath161 , of exponential growth ; similarly , @xmath162 approaches @xmath163 .",
