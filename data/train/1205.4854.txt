    "in recent years a combination of kohn - sham density functional theory ( dft ) and the landauer approach to transport has been developed that allows an ab - initio calculation of the current - voltage characteristics of molecules that are attached to reservoirs .",
    "early comparisons between calculated and experimental conductances yielded discrepancies of several orders of magnitude , while in more recent comparisons a typical discrepancy of one order of magnitude was reported.@xcite concerning experiments , the reproducibility of @xmath0-@xmath1 characteristics in molecular electronics poses a problem , as the contact configuration may change from sample to sample , which makes the comparison between theory and experiment difficult .",
    "first dft studies of lattice models like the hubbard model or spinless fermions date already back to the late 1980s.@xcite at that time ground state dft was the main focus of interest . in the 2000s a lattice version of the local density approximation was constructed using the bethe ansatz solution of the hubbard model , and the accuracy of the method was tested in some detail.@xcite due to the mentioned discrepancies between measured and calculated conductances through molecules , recently the focus turned to the dft description of transport . in the conventional dft approach to the two - terminal linear conductance of a molecular system",
    "the kohn - sham equations are solved in order to obtain the electronic structure , and the conductance of the kohn - sham system , @xmath2 , is used as a theoretical estimate of the true conductance , @xmath3 .",
    "there are thus two possible sources for errors , ( i ) the electronic structure calculation and ( ii ) the identification of @xmath3 with @xmath2 .",
    "while in complex realistic structures it is not possible to quantify ( i ) and ( ii ) this is possible for lattice models , as demonstrated by schmitteckert and evers.@xcite they observed that the kohn - sham conductance , @xmath2 , based on the exact ground state exchange correlation potentials becomes accurate , i.e. @xmath4 , close to ( isolated ) conductance resonances .",
    "remarkably this holds even if the spectral properties of the kohn - sham system strongly differ from the true ones.@xcite for example , the zero temperature conductance through a kondo impurity is captured correctly by @xmath2 .",
    "the reason for this coincidence is the friedel sum rule which guarantees that @xmath3 and @xmath2 have identical functional dependencies on the charge density.@xcite however , as soon as the conductance is not given by a local friedel sum rule there can be orders of magnitude between @xmath2 and the true conductance,@xcite and it can even be parametrically wrong.@xcite it is important to note that this is not a general failure of dft ; rather the assumption that the conductance of the physical electrons is given by the conductance of the kohn - sham particles breaks down .",
    "it has been stated several times in the literature that this discrepancy can be corrected by including dynamic contributions to the exchange - correlation potential that are not captured by ground state functionals.@xcite for the linear current @xmath0 through an impurity this dynamic exchange - correlation potential @xmath5 renormalizes the voltage , such that @xmath6 it is not clear whether a similar voltage renormalization is also present in the non - linear response .",
    "the goal of our study is to investigate the nature of the dynamical response within a dft framework beyond the linear transport regime . to this end",
    "we construct the exact time - dependent exchange - correlation potential for an impurity model with an applied transport voltage .",
    "specifically we construct the time - dependent kohn - sham potentials for a two - terminal transport setup , which by construction yields the correct physical current within the time - dependent dft description . in this paper",
    "we will concentrate on a one - dimensional lattice model , where we can directly compare time - dependent dft with accurate numerical and analytical results obtained by many - body techniques .",
    "@xcite in order to obtain meaningful results we have to solve much larger systems ( here : @xmath7 lattice sites ) than for instance in ref .",
    "( @xmath8 to @xmath9 lattice sites ) .",
    "in addition the densities have to be calculated with an accuracy better than @xmath10 ; otherwise the reverse engineering of the time - dependent exchange - correlation potentials fails .",
    "we consider the interacting resonant level model , i.e. a one - dimensional model of spinless fermions , where a single interacting level is coupled to a left and a right lead , @xmath11 here @xmath12 is the hopping amplitude , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the numbers of sites in the left and right lead , and @xmath15 is the interaction on the contact link .",
    "all the data presented in this article have been obtained for the half - filled lattice model .",
    "we assume that at time @xmath16 the system is in the ground state . at @xmath17",
    "we include a voltage drop by applying a potential @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) on the left ( right ) lead with a linear crossover on a scale of several sites left and right of the impurity .",
    "then we follow the time evolution of the system . on time scales that are shorter than the transit time @xmath20",
    "( @xmath21 is the fermi velocity ) the finite leads act as reservoirs , such that a time - dependent simulation allows to extract the current - voltage relation corresponding to infinite leads , see refs .   and for details .",
    "note that in our model the linear conductance is given by a friedel sum rule.@xcite therefore , @xmath22 vanishes in the linear regime .",
    "we consider a hamiltonian @xmath23 with parameters @xmath15 and @xmath24 and a kohn - sham hamiltonian @xmath25 with the same structure as eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) using different parameters @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the essence of dft is a one - to - one correspondence between local densities and potentials : starting with an uniquely defined initial state there exists an  up to a gauge transformation ",
    "unique set of potentials @xmath28 such that the time - dependent densities @xmath29 are identical for @xmath23 and @xmath25 .",
    "the numerical task is to calculate first the time - dependent local density for @xmath23 and in the second step the set of potentials @xmath30 for @xmath25 .",
    "we fix the gauge by imposing that the sum of the potentials is zero .",
    "to calculate the particle density we follow two strategies : ( a ) the particle density in an interacting system is obtained through time - dependent density matrix renormalization group ( td - dmrg ) as described in refs . and .",
    "since these calculations are extremely time - consuming we also ( b ) study a toy model of non - interacting fermions , where the time - dependent density can be obtained straightforwardly by exact diagonalization . as mentioned before , when calculating @xmath30 from the densities a high accuracy is necessary .",
    "we use an iterative procedure that stops when the densities in @xmath23 and in @xmath25 agree within an error of @xmath31 .",
    "we start by considering the non - interacting version of the hamiltonian ( [ eq2 ] ) , i.e. we set the interaction @xmath15 as well as @xmath32 to zero .",
    "there remains only one free parameter , the hopping amplitude @xmath24 between the impurity site and the leads . in our toy model",

    "the same current has to flow also in the kohn - sham system ; here we find initially a time - dependent voltage which becomes stationary after @xmath41 .",
    "remarkably the exchange - correlation potential ( the difference between @xmath35 and @xmath43 ) is nearly position independent in the leads , and appears immediately after switching on the voltage . in the figure , data for a chain of 200 lattice sites and a chain of 400 lattice sites are presented . in both cases",
    "we plot the potentials for the first ten sites at the left edge of the chain . for the longer chain @xmath35",

    "this implies that no stationary kohn - sham potential can generate such large currents .",

    "this means that the excitations originating form the charge quench at the impurity should not reach the boundary of the leads within the simulation time . in order to obtain the time - dependent densities we apply the full td - dmrg @xcite as it has already proven to provide accurate results that agree perfectly with the analytic solution .",
    "the quench with a symmetric charge imbalance leads to oscillations with frequency @xmath18 during the transient time and finite size induced josephson like oscillations with frequency @xmath70 in the steady state regime.@xcite therefore , when the effective voltage of the kohn - sham system is different from the voltage of the physical one , the time - dependent potentials have to compensate this mismatch .",

    "the final result becomes smooth .",
    "time - dependent kohn - sham potentials on the first ten sites of the left lead varying the voltage applied to the system ( @xmath50 and @xmath72 ) . while for a small voltage ( @xmath76 ) we are able to find a set of kohn - sham potentials for all times , for larger voltages ( @xmath77 , @xmath78 ) this is only possible for short times .",

    "again , there is a regime , where the current in the interacting case is higher than any current achievable in the noninteracting case .",
    "since the noninteracting case is similar to the kohn - sham system , this is a hint that no stationary kohn - sham potential might exist in this regime .",
    "the cases where we find diverging kohn - sham potentials are indeed in the regime where the current for @xmath72 exceeds the one for @xmath79 .",
    "of course , the kohn - sham systems at finite voltage have additional potentials with a spatial structure which is not captured by a single number , @xmath81 .",
    "it is also important to note , that the kohn - sham potentials should not create a current outside the `` light cone '' @xmath82 .",
    "the continuity equation then implies that any oscillations of the potentials outside this regime have to be instantaneous and constant in space including the reservoirs .",
    "while one can gauge the resulting @xmath81 into a time - dependent phase @xmath83 of a hopping element at the impurity , one loses the property of an at least locally stationary system found in this work .",
