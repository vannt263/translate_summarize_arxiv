    "@xmath111    from observation [ observation-2 ] and lemma [ lemma-6 ] , we can compute a cover of @xmath193 by @xmath214 with minimum number of disks using brute - force method , where @xmath215 is the set of disks of unit radius corresponding to the disks in @xmath197 .",

    "though , the worst - case running time of this brute - force algorithm is exponential in @xmath217 , in practice , it is very small .",
    "note that time complexity of our proposed algorithm is less than that of 4-factor approximation algorithm proposed by funke et al .",
    "we now describe approximation factor of our propose algorithm for rrc problem in reduce radius setup .    in the reduce radius setup",

    "note that the diameter of each disk of the rrc instance is 2 .",
    "therefore , we can apply shifting strategy described by hochbaum and maass @xcite to solve rrc problem and the approximation factor is @xmath218 .",
    "thus , the theorem follows .",
    "in this paper , we have proposed a ptas for lsdudc problem , improving previous 2-factor approximation result . using this ptas , we proposed an @xmath7-factor approximation algorithm for dudc problem , improving previous 15-factor approximation result for the same problem .",
    "the running time of our proposed algorithm for @xmath172 ( i.e. , approximation factor of dudc problem is 12)is same as the running time of 15-factor approximation algorithm .",
