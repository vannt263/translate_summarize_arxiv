    "deep inelastic lepton - hadron scattering , starting with the discovery of bjorken scaling in the end of nineteen - sixties has played a crucial role in the development of our present understanding of the nature of particle interaction .",
    "the appearance of the first data on the polarization dis opened a new field of experimental and theoretical investigations and , as a result it led to come the disturbing data of emc in 1988 @xcite .",
    "it is natural , that data processing of the modern experiments on dis of the polarized lepton on the polarized nuclear target requires correct account of the radiative corrections ( rc ) . up to now",
    "there is a series of works where rc are taken into account in the frame of qed - theory for polarization experiments ( see f.e .",
    "those results are used for experiments on a fixed target .",
    "however the polarization dis experiments at collider will be possible in future @xcite .",
    "for the calculation of rc for such kinds of experiments we can not restrict our consideration to @xmath0-exchange graphs only , because in this case the squared transfer momentum @xmath1 is so high that weak effects begin to play an essential role in the total cross section and spin asymmetries . at the same time the ratio @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 is the mass of a scattering lepton ) becomes so small that it could be restricted to non - vanishing terms for @xmath4 .",
    "the similar work was already done by us @xcite , but there we used only the naive parton model . in this article",
    "we present the explicit expressions for model independent part of the one - loop lowest - order rc ( figure [ feyn ] ) to polarized lepton - nucleon scattering which is described in the terms of the electroweak structure functions ( sf ) .",
    "moreover , the target has an arbitrary polarization and the lepton has a longitudinal one .",
    "the contributions appearing from additional virtual particles ( v - contribution ) in the on - mass renormalization scheme and thooft - feynman gauge are presented .",
    "the results of calculation for the unitary gauge can be found in ref .",
    "we note also that the separation of variables in accordance with @xcite allows to write all formulae in a compact form that provided more clearness of the results than it was done in @xcite .",
    "the present article is organized as follows . in the section [ born ] the born contribution and all necessary kinematic invariants",
    "are presented .",
    "the section 3 is devoted to the electroweak one - loop correction .",
