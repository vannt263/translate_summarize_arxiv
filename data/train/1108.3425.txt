    "genus-@xmath2 heegaard splittings of the exteriors of knots in @xmath0 have been a topic of considerable interest for several decades .",
    "they form a class large enough to exhibit rich and interesting geometric behavior , but restricted enough to be tractable .",
    "traditionally such splittings are discussed using the language of knot tunnels , which we will use from now on .    the article @xcite developed two sets of invariants that together give a complete classification of all tunnels of all tunnel number 1 knots",
    "one is a finite sequence of rational `` slope '' invariants , and the other is a finite sequence of binary invariants . the latter sequence is trivial exactly when the tunnel is a so - called @xmath1-tunnel , that is , a tunnel that arises as the  upper \" or  lower \" tunnel of a genus-@xmath3 @xmath3-bridge position of the knot . in the language of @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath1-tunnels are called semisimple , except for those which occur as the upper and lower tunnels of a @xmath2-bridge knot and are called simple . the tunnels which are",
    "not @xmath1-tunnels are called regular .    for quite a long time , the only known examples of knots having both regular and @xmath1-tunnels were ( most ) torus knots , whose tunnels were classified by m. boileau , m. rost , and h. zieschang  @xcite and independently by y. moriah  @xcite . recently , another example was found by h. goda and c. hayashi  @xcite .",
    "the knot is the morimoto - sakuma - yokota @xmath4-knot , and goda and hayashi credit h.  song with bringing it to their attention . like the torus knots",
    ", it has a @xmath1-position with two associated semisimple tunnels , and a third `` middle '' tunnel which is regular .",
    "a tunnel arc for the regular tunnel is shown in figure  [ fig : goda - hayashi ] .",
    "-knot . the dotted line is a tunnel arc for its regular tunnel.,width=40 ]    a preliminary version of @xcite contained a gap in the verification that the latter tunnel is not a @xmath1-tunnel : the authors relied on proposition  1.3 of ( the nonetheless useful and important work ) @xcite , which turns out to be erroneous .",
    "as noted in  @xcite , k. ishihara  @xcite developed an algorithm to compute the slope invariants of a tunnel using manipulation of families of compressing disks in the associated heegaard splitting , and successfully applied it to compute the sequence of binary invariants of the tunnel , sufficient to complete the proof that it is regular . in view of this",
    ", we will refer to this example as the goda - hayashi - ishihara tunnel . as noted in  @xcite , a simple modification of their construction , varying a nonzero integer parameter @xmath5",
    ", produces an infinite collection of very similar examples .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze a general construction that produces all examples directly obtainable by the geometric phenomenon that underlies the goda - hayashi - ishihara example .",
    "moreover , we give an effective method to compute the full set of slope invariants of any of these examples .",
    "we illustrate it by computing the slope invariants of the goda - hayashi - ishihara example , and the binary invariants as well , verifying ishihara s calculation .",
    "here is a knot - theoretic description of the examples .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig : ghi ] below , the morimoto - sakuma - yokota @xmath4-knot is the band sum of two torus knots @xmath6 and @xmath7 lying in concentric tori , by a ( half - twisted ) band running vertically between the tori , with the tunnel represented by an arc cutting across the band .",
    "the general example is an ( arbitrarily twisted ) band sum of two concentric torus knots @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( for certain allowable combinations of @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 ) .",
    "as we will see , in terms of our theory this tunnel is obtained by a cabling construction starting from the middle tunnel of the torus knot @xmath8 .    for calculations ,",
    "we need a very precise description . the general construction , detailed in section  [ sec : splitting ] after preliminary work in sections  [ sec : torus_knots ] and  [ sec : drop - lift ] ,",

    "the solid torus is a neighborhood of a certain torus knot @xmath20 in another level of @xmath21 .",
    "inserting a disk called @xmath22 into @xmath17 , in a certain way , is a cabling construction  @xcite that produces the new tunnel ( provided that @xmath23 ) .",

    ", the setup will be used in  @xcite to calculate the slope invariants obtained by an iteration of the splitting construction , which we will discuss momentarily .",
    "section  [ sec : splitting_construction_slopes ] uses the general method to give the slopes in all cases of the splitting construction , and section  [ sec : ghi_calculation ] illustrates them for the goda - hayashi - ishihara example .    each tunnel obtained by the splitting construction",
    "is associated to a @xmath1-position of its associated knot , and in section  [ sec : uuperlower ] we explain how the method of  @xcite allows an easy calculation of the slope invariants of its upper and lower tunnels . as usual , we apply these to the goda - hayashi - ishihara example .",
    "we mentioned a further generalization of the splitting construction . in  @xcite",
    ", we show how one can start with a tunnel obtained by a splitting construction and carry out an iteration of similar constructions , producing a much larger class of knots having both regular and semisimple tunnels .",
    "each of the four splitting constructions admits two kinds of iteration sequences , giving eight versions of the iterated construction . as with the splitting constructions , which allows variation by any nonzero choice of @xmath5 , each cabling in an iterated sequence",
    "can be varied by a nonzero integer , producing an enormous number of possible examples .",
    "rather surprisingly to the authors , the setup of sections  [ sec : first_general_slope_calculation ] and  [ sec : second_general_slope_calculation ] allows one to calculate the slopes of all the cablings in the iterated construction .",
    "we have already described most of the content of the paper , apart from the first section below which establishes notation and reviews the method from  @xcite for calculating the invariants of the middle tunnels of torus knots .",
    "we have not included a review of the general theory , as the original theory is detailed in  @xcite and brief reviews are already available in several of our articles .",

    "<S> we generalize their construction and calculate the slope invariants for the resulting middle tunnels . in particular , we obtain the slope sequence of the original example of goda , hayashi , and ishihara . </S>"
