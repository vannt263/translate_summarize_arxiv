    "in the setting of hyperbolic diffeomorphisms , smale s spectral decomposition theorem organizes the global dynamics by decomposing it into a finite number of pieces . after the first examples of open sets of non hyperbolic systems @xcite people focused on non hyperbolic dynamics trying to recover a decomposition in pieces in this new setting .",
    "many such examples have been obtained , and we can distinguish two main different behaviours :    * the dynamics can be globally  undecomposable \" : there are open sets of _ transitive _ systems , i.e. having a half - orbit which is dense in the whole manifold , see  @xcite . in the same spirit ,",
    "other examples present a decomposition in finitely many disjoint , isolated , robustly transitive compact invariant sets @xcite .",
    "* on the opposite , the dynamics of generic systems in some @xmath3-open sets ( @xmath4 ) can split into infinitely many pieces , see  @xcite . necessarily in this case , some pieces of the decomposition should be accumulated by other ones .",
    "these two patterns ( finite or infinite number of indecomposable pieces ) are called _ tame _ and _ wild _ systems : in order to formalize these notions we have to explain what we mean by `` pieces '' .",
    "several definitions have been proposed .    *",
    "a natural way for a piece to be dynamically indecomposable is to be transitive . among notable transitive sets",
    "homoclinic classes _ of hyperbolic periodic orbits , that is , the closure of the transversal intersection of ther invariant manifolds .",
    "these classes contain dense subsets of hyperbolic periodic orbits that are _ homoclinically related _ : the stable manifold of each of these orbits intersects transversally the unstable manifold of each other .",
    "* other natural candidates for pieces are the _ maximal transitive sets _",
    "@xcite . they always exists but may fail to be disjoint and to capture a large part of the dynamics . * by weakening the notion of transitivity , conley @xcite defined the very general notion of _ chain - recurrence classes _ for homeomorphisms on a compact manifold @xmath5 .",
    "the _ chain - recurrent set _",
    "@xmath6 is the set of points @xmath7 contained in closed @xmath8-pseudo - orbits for every @xmath9 .",
    "this set splits into invariant compact subsets called _ chain - recurrence classes _ : two points @xmath10 are in a same class if for every @xmath9 they are contained in a same closed @xmath8-pseudo - orbit .",
    "the chain - recurrence classes cover the whole interesting dynamics , as this notion of recurrence is the weakest possible : the chain - recurrence set contains the limit sets and the non - wandering set .",
    "moreover , the different chain - recurrence classes can be separated by filtrations of the dynamics .",
    "each of these notions has its advantages and drawbacks and in general they do not coincide .",
    "when @xmath11 is a @xmath0-generic diffeomorphism , one gets better properties . for instance , @xcite showed that any chain - recurrence class @xmath12 containing a hyperbolic periodic orbit @xmath13 coincides with the homoclinic class @xmath14 of @xmath13 , and is the unique maximal transitive set containing @xmath13 .",
    "of course , these properties are not satisfied by all diffeomorphisms , but once they hold @xmath0-generically , one can expect that they persist on larger class of systems , in particular for some close @xmath3-diffeomorphisms .",
    "more precisely one can ask :    consider a hyperbolic periodic orbit @xmath15 whose continuation exists on an open set @xmath16 of @xmath0-diffeomorphisms . under what conditions",
    "does there exists a dense open subset @xmath17 such that the chain - recurrence class containing @xmath15 is transitive for any @xmath18 ? coincides with the homoclinic class @xmath19 ?",
    "this question could be asked for an important particular case .",
    "a chain - recurrence class @xmath12 of a diffeomorphisms @xmath11 is _ robustly isolated _ ( for the @xmath0-topology ) if there exists a neighborhood @xmath20 of @xmath12 and a @xmath0-neighborhood @xmath1 of @xmath11 such that , for every @xmath21 , the set @xmath22 of chain - recurrent points in @xmath20 coincides precisely with a chain - recurrence class @xmath23 of @xmath24 called its _",
    "continuation_.    following  @xcite , one says that a diffeomorphism @xmath11 is _ tame _ if each of its chain - recurrence classes is robustly isolated : in this case , the number of chain - recurrence classes is finite and constant on a @xmath0-neighborhood of @xmath11 .",
    "tame diffeomorphisms are the simplest ones and the dynamics of @xmath0-generic such systems is easier to describe : for instance , all its chain - recurrence classes are homoclinic classes  @xcite . until now ,",
    "the unique known examples of tame dynamics have robustly transitive chain - recurrence classes , i.e. robustly isolated classes whose continuation remains transitive for any @xmath0-perturbation .",
    "for this reason it was natural to ask :    [ q.1 ] is there a dense subset @xmath25 in the space @xmath26 of diffeomorphisms such that every robustly isolated chain - recurrence class of any @xmath27 is robustly transitive ?    the present paper gives a negative answer to this question .",
    "we denote there by @xmath28 the space of @xmath3-diffeomorphisms of @xmath5 .",
    "any compact manifold @xmath5 , with @xmath29 , admits a smooth diffeomorphism @xmath11 with a robustly isolated chain - recurrence class @xmath30 satisfying for any @xmath31 the following property .",
    "the diffeomorphisms @xmath24 such that the continuation @xmath23 is not transitive form a @xmath3-dense subset of a @xmath0-neighborhood of @xmath11 in @xmath28 .",
    "actually , the fact for a class to be robustly isolated brings several restriction on the dynamics . on surfaces , it is well - known that such a class needs to be far from homoclinic tangencies  @xcite . also it was shown in  @xcite that it presents dominated splittings and volume hyperbolicity . indeed the dominated splitting is the structure which is antagonist to the homoclinic tangencies  @xcite .",
    "conversely , we expect ( see  @xcite , conjecture 11 ) that , @xmath0-generically , any chain - recurrent classes exhibiting enough hyperbolicity is robustly isolated : this should be the case for _ partially hyperbolic _ classes with a one - dimensional center bundle ( see a precise definition in section  [ ss.partial ] ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to build an example of a robustly isolated class as close as possible to being hyperbolic , in particular @xmath0-far from homoclinic tangencies , which nevertheless is not robustly transitive .",
    "there is the precise statement of our result .",

    "moreover , each pair of hyperbolic periodic points in @xmath30 with the same stable dimension is homoclinically related . * for any @xmath39 there exist two hyperbolic periodic points @xmath40 satisfying @xmath41 and @xmath30 is the disjoint union of @xmath42 with @xmath43 .",

    "let us give now the spirit of our construction .",
    "we consider two hyperbolic periodic points @xmath49 and @xmath50 with different stable dimension : @xmath51 .",
    "we assume moreover that they robustly belong to the same chain - recurrence class @xmath30 , which has a partially hyperbolic structure with @xmath52 dimensional central bundle @xmath53 . such construction can be obtained using blenders , as in  @xcite .",
    "we can guarantee that a central orientation is preserved so that each point in @xmath30 has a right and a left central direction .",
    "we will choose @xmath49 to be extremal points of the class @xmath30 in the following sense ( see section  [ s.cuspidal ] ) : we assume that the strong stable manifold @xmath54 of @xmath49 just meets @xmath30 at @xmath49 and that the intersection @xmath55 is contained in a right half submanifold bounded by @xmath54 .",
    "in this case the class @xmath30 is contained in a cuspidal prism whose edge is the strong unstable manifold of @xmath49 , see figure  [ figuracostado ] .",

    "as @xmath49 and @xmath50 belong to the same class , small perturbations produce heteroclinic intersections @xmath43 .",
    "in particular , any such intersection belongs to @xmath30 but the simultaneous left and right cuspidal geometry implies that it is isolated in @xmath30 .",

    "our construction uses strongly the existence of strong stable and strong unstable manifolds outside of the chain - recurrence class @xmath30 .",
