    "results from detailed agb stellar models demonstrate that low mass agb stars ( i.e. @xmath4 ) are the producers of the main component of the cosmic @xmath5-elements ( straniero et al .",
    "1995 ; gallino et al .",
    "1998 ; busso et al .",
    "such a scenario has been confirmed by the measurements of the chemical composition of agb stars ( lambert et al .",
    "1995 ; busso et al .",
    "2001 ; abia et al .",
    "2001,2002 ) and by the analysis of the isotopic composition of meteoritic sic grains ( gallino et al .",
    "1997 ) .    the present generation of agb stars , as observed in the disk of our galaxy , have a nearly solar chemical composition . however , sic grains found in pristine meteorites originated in the c - rich circumstellar envelope of a pre - solar generation of agb stars , whose original metallicity could have been somewhat lower than that found in the solar system material .",
    "in addition , an important contribution to our understanding of agb stars comes from observations of the stellar population in the fields of the small and the large magellanic clouds , whose average metallicities are about 1/5 and 1/2 of the solar , respectively . in a previous paper ( straniero et al .",
    "1997 ) the properties of low mass agb stellar models with solar composition have been extensively discussed . here",
    "we present an extension of these models to lower metallicity .",
    "the full grid of models is summarized in tab .",
    "the corresponding agb evolutionary sequences have been obtained by means of the franec code , the same described in straniero et al .",
    "the initial mass , the helium content and the metallicity are reported in column 1 , 2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "various mass loss rates have been applied during the agb phase . in all cases ,",
    "we have used the reimers formula ( reimers , 1975 ) :    @xmath6    where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are in solar units and @xmath9 is a free parameter ( see fourth column in tab .",
    "we have not considered mass loss in pre - agb evolution , since , in the mass range 1.5 - 3 m@xmath10 , just a few hundredths of solar masses are expected to be lost .",
    "for example , by adopting @xmath9=0.4 as representative of the pre - agb mass loss rate ( e.g. fusi pecci & renzini 1976 ) , we found that the total mass lost before the onset of the agb phase by a 2 m@xmath10 star with solar composition should be 0.04 m@xmath10 .",
    "clearly , such a small amount of mass loss has negligible consequences on the pre - agb evolution .",
    "the thermally pulsing agb models ( tp - agb ) are characterized by three distinct phases :    \\1 ) the _ early phase_. it includes the first few ( gentle ) thermal pulses which are not followed by the third dredge up ( tdu ) ;    \\2 ) the _ tdu phase_. it begins when the mass of the h exhausted core becomes as large as @xmath11 .",
    "the amount of mass dredged up firstly increases , as the core mass increases , and then decreases , when the envelope mass is substantially reduced ;    \\3 ) the _ final phase_. during the last part of the agb , the concurrent actions of mass loss and h - burning erode the envelope mass and the tdu ceases .",
    "the minimum envelope mass for the occurrence of the tdu is about @xmath12 .",
    "the variation of the mass dredged up , as a function of the core mass , is shown in fig . 1 for some selected sequences of models .",
    "an interpolation on the grid of models provides useful analytic expressions for relevant quantities , as a function of @xmath13 ( the mass of the h - exhausted core , in @xmath14 ) , @xmath15 ( the mass of the h - rich envelope , in @xmath14 ) and z ( the initial mass fraction of elements with @xmath16 ) .    in the following we report the result of these interpolations",
    "the time elapsed between two successive thermal pulses ( interpulse period ) :    @xmath17    @xmath18    which is valid for @xmath19 . for smaller core masses , substitute @xmath13 with @xmath20 .",
    "the standard deviation of this fit ( i.e. the average difference between the values calculated with the fitting formula and those of the models ) is 0.01 .",
    "the mass of the h - depleted material dredged up in a given tdu episode :    @xmath21    @xmath22    @xmath23    where @xmath24 and @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the core mass at the last thermal pulse without tdu ( last pulse of the _ early phase _ ) . for the masses and chemical compositions we have considered , @xmath26 ranges between 0.59 and 0.6 .",
    "the curves reported in fig . 1 have been obtained by using @xmath27 . when @xmath28 or @xmath29 , take @xmath30 .",
    "the standard deviation of this fitting formula is 2 @xmath31 10@xmath32 .",
    "\\3 ) the luminosity at half of the interpulse period :    @xmath33    here @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the core mass at the epoch of the first thermal pulse ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "the latter quantity slightly depends on the metallicity : @xmath37 . for this fit",
    "the standard deviation is 10@xmath32 .",
    "\\4 ) the effective temperature at half of the interpulse period :    @xmath38    here , @xmath39 is the effective metallicity , which includes the extra - carbon in the envelope due to the third dredge up .",
    "the use of @xmath39 , instead of @xmath40 , has minor effects on solar composition stars , but may significantly increase the estimated radius and , in turn , the mass loss rate for stars with an original low content of metal .",
    "the standard deviation is 5 @xmath31 10@xmath32 .",
    "\\5 ) the maximum temperature attained at the bottom of the convective zone generated by a thermal pulse :    @xmath41    @xmath42    for @xmath43 the standard deviation is 3 @xmath31 10@xmath44 .",
    "finally , the evolution of the core mass during the whole tp - agb phase may be estimated by means of the following formula :    @xmath45    where @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath47 corresponds to the last thermal pulse without tdu ( @xmath48 ) ; @xmath49 is the number of tps of the _ early phase _ , while @xmath50 is the number of tps occurred from the first tdu episode up to the agb tip ( _ tdu phase + final phase _ ) .",
    "this formula gives @xmath13 within 5 @xmath51 @xmath14 .",
    "then , the envelope mass is easily obtained : @xmath52 , where @xmath7 is the total mass .",
    "note that , if the initial mass of the star is too small , the conditions for the activation of the third dredge up ( namely , @xmath53 @xmath14 and @xmath54 @xmath14 ) are never reached .",
    "the minimum mass for the occurrence of the tdu , as a function of the mass loss rate , are reported in fig .",
    "2 , for solar composition models . in stars with masses exceeding this lower limit ,",
    "the envelope composition is modified by the tdu : @xmath55c and @xmath5-elements are enhanced .",
    "obviously , a c - star may form , after a suitable number of tdu episodes , only if the initial mass is large enough . the dashed line in fig .",
    "2 shows , for solar metallicity models , the lower mass limit for the formation of a c - star as a function of @xmath9 .",
    "both these lower limits depend on metallicity : the smaller the metallicity , the smaller is the mass for the activation of the tdu phase and the lower is the minimum initial mass for the formation of a c - star .",
    "this occurrence is illustrated in fig .",
    "3 ( for @xmath9=0.5 ) .    at low metallicity ( i.e. @xmath56 ) , even taking into account an enhanchement of the @xmath57-elements ( as typically found in halo stars ) , the amount of oxygen in the envelope is so low that just one tdu episode is sufficient to increase the c / o ratio above unity .",
    "correspondingly , the core mass and the luminosity at c / o @xmath58 1 decrease at low @xmath40 ( see fig .",
    "an he - rich zone , as the one left by the shell h - burning , has a significantly lower opacity than an h - rich zone , at the same temperature and pressure .",
    "thus , when the innermost layer of the convective envelope ( h - rich ) penetrates into the region of decreasing h and increasing he ( at the epoch of the tdu ) , the local value of the radiative opacity increases .",
    "since the radiative gradient ( @xmath59 ) is proportional to the opacity , the condition @xmath60 ( where @xmath61 is the adiabatic temperature gradient ) takes place at the base of the convective envelope . in this case , the internal boundary of the convective zone becomes unstable ( becker & iben 1979 ; castellani , chieffi & straniero 1990 ; frost & lattanzio 1996 ; castellani , marconi & straniero 1998 ) .",
    "in fact , even a small perturbation may increase the radiative gradient in the formally stable region , located immediately below the convective envelope , which immediately becomes convectively unstable . at present , a satisfactory treatment of this phenomenon has not yet been found .",
    "however , its overall effect on agb stellar models may be derived by appling a small perturbation to the boundaries of the convective regions . as a tentative scheme",
    ", we have supposed that the velocity of the convective elements , usually evaluated by means of the mixing length theory , does not abruptly drop to 0 at the convective boundaries , but decreases following an exponential decline law ( for more details on the mixing algorithm see section 2 in chieffi et al .",
    "2001 ) :    @xmath62 ,    where _ z _ is the distance from the convective boundary , @xmath63 the average velocity at the convective boundary , _ h@xmath64 _ the pressure scale height at the convective boundary and @xmath65 is a free parameter that controls the steepness of the velocity decline .",
    "usually , when the convective boundary is located within a chemically homogeneous region , @xmath66 and the convective border is stable .",
    "however , at the epoch of the tdu , at the base of the convective envelope the difference between radiative and adiabatic gradients increases .",
    "thus , @xmath63 increases , causing an inward propagation of the convective instability .",
    "the final result is a substantial increase of the tdu efficiency . with @xmath67 , for example , the amount of h - depleted mass dredged up by convection is about a factor 2 larger than that found in models without the exponential decline of the convective velocity ( cristallo et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "few additional models have been computed by taken @xmath67 ( see last column in tab .",
    "the effect on the minimum mass for c - star progenitors is shown in fig .",
    "2 , in the case of solar composition models .",
    "the corresponding decrease of the minimum c - star luminosity is illustrated in fig .",
    ".the computed grid of models .",
    "@xmath7 is the initial mass . @xmath68 and @xmath40 are the initial helium content and the metallicity , respectively .",
    "@xmath9 is the free parameter in the reimers mass loss formula .",
    "@xmath65 is the free parameter in the exponential decline law for the boundary velocity of the convective elements ( section 3 ) . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this paper , based on an homogeneous grid of low mass agb stellar models , we provide some interpolation formulae for basic ingredients used in nucleosynthesis calculations .",
    "these formulae are strictly valid for @xmath69 , at solar metallicity , and for @xmath70 , in the metallicity range @xmath71 .    a study of the third dredge - up as a function of total mass and metallicity has been recently published by karakas , lattanzio & pols ( 2002 ) , while a comparison among the agb stellar models computed by means of different evolutionary codes has been discussed by lugaro et al .",
    "once the same mass loss rate is adopted , a substantial agreement is found between our ( franec ) results and those obtained by using the mount stromlo stellar structure program ( frost and lattanzio , 1996 ; karakas , lattanzio & pols 2002 ) .    as a final remark , note that although we have used a reimers formula to evaluate the mass loss , since the fittings formulae are given as a function of the envelope and core masses , they can be used for any mass loss law .",
