    "<S> it is worthwhile to mention that , if weak higher order terms which may break the time - reversal symmetry are included in the @xmath128 hamiltonian , the quantum interference correction will be slightly smaller as pointed out in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> even though interactions can also contribute to conductivity , interaction - induced magnetoconductivity usually has much weaker magnetic field dependence compared to the one induced by the quantum interference @xcite ; it is expected that our results above are robust if weak interactions are included </S>",
