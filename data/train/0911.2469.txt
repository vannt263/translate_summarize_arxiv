    "it has been clear for decades that metallicity is the most influential factor governing the hb morphologies of galactic gcs : metallicity is the first parameter .",
    "the earliest photographic color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of gcs by , e.g.@xcite , revealed that hb stars in metal - rich gcs tend to lie on the red side of the rr lyrae instability strip while hb stars in metal - poor gcs lie primarily on the blue side .",
    "as more and more cmds were assembled , exceptions to this rule were uncovered .",
    "@xcite noted that m  13 and m  22 display hb morphologies appropriate for metal - poor gcs , despite the fact both gcs were of intermediate metallicity , and suggested that a difference in age might be responsible .",
    "@xcite noticed that the hb of ngc  7006 is redder than either m  13 or m  3 , despite the fact that all three gcs appeared to have very similar metallicities .",
    "such anomalies suggested the need for a second parameter that could account for differences in hb morphology not obviously caused by metallicity .",
    "@xcite summarized the problem , stating that metallicity is not sufficient to explain the extent of observed hb morphologies but that differences in age or he enrichment could explain the observed variations .",
    "both of these suggestions remain valid up to the present time .",
    "@xcite analyzed the integrated colors of 49 gcs with @xmath2 photometry and concluded that ` at least two parameters ( one of which is metal abundance ) are required to describe globular clusters . '",
    "the second parameter phenomenon took on a greater significance with the seminal work of @xcite .",
    "searle & zinn recognized that gcs with unusually red hbs are relatively rare in the inner regions of the galactic halo ( galactocentric radius , @xmath3 kpc ) but become increasingly common at greater @xmath4 ( see their figure 10 ) .",
    "searle & zinn used this fact to argue that the inner halo was assembled early and in a fairly short time while the outer halo was assembled over an extended period of time .",
    "current galaxy formation scenarios envision the outer regions of the galaxy as the accumulated debris of the many accretion events that shaped the early evolution of the galaxy . in that context , understanding the origin and existence of age and metallicity gradients in the galactic gc population is as relevant now as it was at the time when searle & zinn first introduced their halo formation scenario .",
    "subsequent efforts relating to the second parameter problem fall into two general categories : those that attempt to measure the age difference between two ( or a few ) gcs with similar metallicities but markedly different hb morphologies and those that investigate the ensemble properties of a large sample of gcs .",
    "one canonical pair in the former category is ngc  288 , with a blue hb , and ngc  362 , with a red hb .",
    "the first ccd - based , differential photometric study of these clusters was conducted by @xcite .",
    "bolte concluded that ngc  288 is @xmath13 gyr older than ngc  362 .",
    "the subsequent work of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite echoed this result .",
    "by contrast , @xcite reached a very different conclusion . using the brightest rgb star in each gc",
    ", @xcite corrected the photometry of ngc  288 and ngc  362 for their relative distances and found their main sequence turnoffs to be roughly coincident , thereby suggesting a negligible age difference .",
    "@xcite found ngc  288 to be 2@xmath51 gyr older than ngc  362 using three different techniques ; in a follow - up , @xcite found that an age difference of 2 gyr was plausible if both gcs have @xmath6}}\\sim -1.2 $ ] but that their synthetic hb models were unable to match the detailed hb morphology of either gc using canonical assumptions of average mass loss and dispersion on the hb . in considering differences between second parameter pairs , it is important to understand just how similar the abundances are in both clusters .",
    "@xcite performed a detailed comparison of abundances in red giants with 13 stars in ngc  288 and 12 in ngc  362 .",
    "these authors concluded that ngc  288 has a lower @xmath6}}$ ] than ngc  362 by 0.06 dex , that the average @xmath7}}$ ] ratios are very similar , and that both gcs exhibit variations among o , na , and al .",
    "the other canonical second parameter pair is m  13 , with a blue hb , and m  3 , with an intermediate hb .",
    "m  13 and m  3 are @xmath10.2 dex more metal poor than ngc  288 and ngc  362 .",
    "@xcite found evidence for an age difference but the quality of their cmds did not allow a more definitive statement .",
    "@xcite estimated an upper limit to the age difference of @xmath13 gyr and concluded that it was insufficient to explain the hb morphologies , assuming both gcs have the same chemical composition .",
    "alternatively , @xcite suggested the difference in their hb morphologies was due to a difference in their he abundances .",
    "johnson & bolte suggested that m  13 had a he mass fraction @xmath10.05 greater than m  3 .",
    "however , @xcite showed that a difference of @xmath8y @xmath9 at constant @xmath6}}$ ] would make the level of the hb brighter by @xmath10.2 mag . such a difference between m  3 and",
    "m  13 was ruled out by the photometry of @xcite , who also concluded that m  13 is older than m  3 by @xmath10 gyr .",
    "@xcite compared spectra of 28 red giants in m  3 with 35 in m  13 and found the two gcs mean @xmath6}}$ ] values the same within their 1-@xmath11 error bars .",
    "however , @xcite reported differences in light element abundance variations , particularly o , for which m  13 displays a larger range of variation than m  3 by @xmath10.5 dex .",
    "a discussion of the search for the second parameter in gc - to - gc comparisons would not be complete without including the work of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these investigations used hst wfpc2 photometry to measure the ages of the outer halo gcs palomar  3 , palomar  4 , and eridanus @xcite and am-1 and palomar  14 @xcite relative to inner halo gcs with similar metallicities , m3 and m5 .",
    "each of the five outer halo gcs has a redder hb morphology than its comparison inner halo gc .",
    "both studies concluded that the outer halo gcs are @xmath11.5 - 2 gyr younger than m3 and m5 , provided the chemical compositions of the outer halo gcs are comparable to their inner halo counterparts . a recent study by @xcite found the abundances of pal  3 are essentially the same as inner halo gcs of similar metallicity and thus the relative age comparison with m  3 by @xcite was justified .",
    "overall , the outer halo gcs chemical compositions remain poorly understood by comparison with the inner halo , see e.g.@xcite .",
    "@xcite found the reported age differences between pal  4 and eridanus , with red hbs , and m  5 , with an intermediate hb , too small to explain the difference in hb morphologies unless all three gcs are younger than 10 gyr , assuming standard assumptions of mass loss on the rgb .",
    "@xcite concluded that it was possible to explain the difference in hb morphology between pal  3 and m  3 if the former has less hb mass dispersion and is younger than the latter .",
    "these examples indicate that if age is the second parameter , then it is our lack of understanding of mass loss that confuses gc - to - gc comparisons as first pointed out by @xcite .",
    "the review by @xcite includes a thorough discussion of different mass loss prescriptions and their efficacy . given the hb morphologies and relatively young ages of the most distant outer halo gcs , it is important to include them when considering the properties of the entire galactic gc population , especially in the context of searle & zinn s halo formation scenario .",
    "the second category of second parameter studies are those that consider the properties of a large sample of galactic gcs , e.g.@xcite . in the first ccd - era study ,",
    "@xcite compiled properties for 31 galactic gcs . among other things",
    ", @xcite examined the variation of hb morphology with age for gcs in a narrow range of metal abundance and showed that gcs with red hbs are significantly younger than those with blue hbs by as much as 5 gyr .",
    "the subsequent studies of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite updated and reaffirmed this result .",
    "@xcite found that the gcs with @xmath12 kpc are , on average , younger than those with @xmath13 kpc , which is consistent with age as the second parameter .",
    "by contrast , @xcite examined the cmds of 36 gcs , found an age dispersion of @xmath11 gyr with no significant age gradient in the galactic halo , and concluded that this age range was too small for metallicity and age alone to explain hb morphology in gcs .",
    "theoretical efforts have provided further insights into the complexities of hb morphology . in particular ,",
    "several studies have applied the synthetic hb model developed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite used synthetic hb models to explore the interplay of hb morphology , metallicity , and age in the cmd .",
    "these studies demonstrated considerable degeneracy in the hb morphology ",
    "metallicity diagram and , in particular , @xcite argued that unless absolute values of the he abundance , @xmath7}}$ ] ratios , and rgb mass loss were known , hb morphology did not constitute a reliable age constraint .",
    "nevertheless , @xcite concluded that there was evidence for an age dispersion of @xmath14 gyr among galactic gcs of similar metallicity but markedly different hb morphologies .",
    "a number of theoretical studies have also focused on second parameter pairs or triads but , unfortunately , the lack of a firm theoretical understanding of mass loss along the rgb has impaired the these efforts , as first pointed out by @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for a recent review .    as it pertains to hb morphology",
    ", the use of the term second parameter has expanded to cover a broad range of complex behaviors . in particular , this includes the faint extent of the blue hb tail in some gcs .",
    "@xcite analyzed 53 gcs and found that the length of the hb in the cmd  and the extent of the blue tail  is correlated with central density . @xcite also reported a link between an extended blue tail and central density in gcs and concluded that ` environment is `` a '' second parameter ' .",
    "@xcite showed that there is a correlation between central density and hb morphology for intermediate metallicity gcs ( @xmath15 } } < -1.3 $ ] ) where the second parameter effect is most pronounced .",
    "@xcite analyzed the properties of 54 galactic gcs with homogeneous photometry from an hst wfpc2 snapshot survey @xcite and concluded that more massive gcs tend to have more extended blue hbs .",
    "@xcite recognized a link between the effective temperature of the hottest hb star in a gc and its mass ( as inferred from its integrated luminosity ) and suggested that self - pollution could explain the existence of faint blue tails in preferentially massive gcs .",
    "evidence abounds for the presence of chemical abundance variations in all gcs @xcite and the possible correlation between the degree of abundance variations and the faint extent of the blue hb @xcite . however , it is unlikely that the existence of faint , blue tails in the hbs of some gcs is directly related to the appearance of anomalously red hbs in others .",
    "it is also unlikely that chemical abundance variations will unduly affect age estimates of most gcs , provided the total metal content is constant across all stars @xcite . for cases in which the total metal abundance is not constant , or there are distinct stellar populations present in the cmd ,",
    "age estimates are necessarily more complicated and careful analysis of each of these gcs is needed .",
    "see @xcite for a recent summary of gcs with multiple stellar populations visible in the cmd , several of which were discovered with photometry from the acs survey of galactic gcs .",
    "the complex issue of multiple stellar populations in gcs remains poorly understood and the extent to which multiple - population gcs permeate the galactic gc population is unknown at present .",
    "to summarize , the presence of metal poor gcs with red hbs that primarily reside in the outer galactic halo is well - known observationally .",
    "although the present study is focused on the galactic gcs , including some of those associated with the sagittarius dwarf , there is ample evidence to suggest that metal poor gcs with red hbs are also found in the magellanic clouds @xcite and fornax @xcite .",
    "@xcite summarize our current knowledge of the gc populations in the galaxy and its satellites in the hb morphology  metallicity diagram . despite an abundance of observational evidence , no consensus has been reached as to what parameter(s ) are responsible for the appearance of relatively red hbs in metal poor gcs .",
    "age is frequently offered as a candidate but considerable doubt still remains because the age difference claimed  or required by theoretical studies of hb morphology  is too large to satisfy the observations .",
    "the existence of a homogeneous database of deep , high quality photometry from the acs survey of galactic gcs ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper i in this series ) has motivated a re - examination of hb morphology and its relation to a variety of gc properties .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : @xmath16[data ] describes the data sample ; @xmath16[hbm ] describes the methods that were employed to determine the hb morphologies ; @xmath16[gcages ] describes the sources of gc ages and provides some discussion of complicating factors in age determination ; @xmath16[results ] presents the analysis performed on the assembled data and discusses the important results ; and , finally , @xmath16[conclusion ] provides a summary of the salient points .",
    "the photometric catalog of the acs survey of galactic gcs ( * ? ? ? * paper v ) consists of 65 gcs observed in @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "most details concerning the data reduction and calibration are provided in paper v but , since its publication , the data have been adjusted to account for updated hst / acs wide field channel zero - points @xcite ; the new @xmath17 and @xmath18 zeropoints are , respectively , 22 and 35 mmag fainter than given by @xcite .",
    "not all gcs in the acs survey catalog will be considered in the analysis performed in the following sections .",
    "@xmath19 cen ( ngc  5139 ) and m  54 ( ngc  6715 ) have been excluded because their complex cmds and abundances indicate that these objects are not gcs in the traditional sense .",
    "@xcite analyzed the m  54 cmd and measured ages for the stellar populations present and also estimated the metallicities of the stellar populations for which no spectroscopic information was available . because m  54 lies at the center of the sagittarius dwarf galaxy , it is not a simple process to distinguish between the stellar population(s ) that belong to m  54 and those of the sagittarius dwarf galaxy .",
    "@xmath19 cen has long been known to contain a range of different metallicities as well as multiple stellar populations in the cmd @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented a spectroscopic analysis of 180 red giants in @xmath19 cen that revealed at least four distinct metallicities and a total range of @xmath20 dex in @xmath6}}$ ] .",
    "other gcs for which multiple stellar population evidence exists will be noted in the following sections .",
    "@xcite provided a summary of the gcs known to exhibit multiple stellar populations in their cmds circa 2008 .",
    "three more gcs were excluded : pal  1 and e  3 for lack of identifiable hb stars and pal  2 due to extreme differential reddening ( see paper i ) . in total , 60 gcs from the acs survey are considered in the following analysis .",
    "the acs survey provides coverage of the galactic gc population out to @xmath120 kpc . in order to give proper consideration to the outer galactic halo ,",
    "where the second parameter phenomenon is most pronounced , the sample was extended to include the following gcs : ngc  2419 @xcite ; pal  3 , pal  4 , and eridanus @xcite ; and am-1 and pal  14 @xcite .",
    "these are the six most distant gcs in the galaxy with @xmath21 kpc @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , no photometry of comparable quality is currently available for the 10 or so gcs that lie between these two groups ( @xmath22 kpc ) kpc : pal  15 , ngc  7006 , and pyxis . ] . in order to distinguish between the homogeneous acs survey sample and the larger , heterogeneous sample , the statistical analysis in section @xmath16[results",
    "] will be presented with and without the six outer halo gcs .",
    "in addition to hb morphologies ( @xmath16[hbm ] ) and ages ( @xmath16[gcages ] ) , several gc parameters were extracted from @xcite .",
    "the @xcite catalog is based on the @xcite catalog but includes several updated quantities and , importantly , provides quantities in absolute physical units .",
    "these units are more appropriate for comparisons than the observational units given in the @xcite catalog .",
    "the quantities obtained from the @xcite catalog are : galactocentric distance ( @xmath4 ) , integrated absolute @xmath23 magnitude ( @xmath24 ) , half - light radius ( @xmath25 ) , and tidal radius ( @xmath26 ) . from the @xcite catalog we extracted central luminosity density ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "neither catalog includes basic measurements for lyng  7 .",
    "inclusion of these quantities in the following analysis makes it possible to explore the possibility that a gc s location in the galaxy , structural properties , and total mass ( assuming the mass - to - light ratio is constant ) can influence its hb morphology .",
    "in this study , hb morphology is characterized by the difference between the median color of the hb stars and the median color of the rgb at the level of the hb , denoted @xmath0 .",
    "this metric is essentially the same as @xmath28 @xcite and is less likely to become saturated than the most frequently used hb morphology parameter , ( b@xmath29r)/(b+v+r ) introduced by @xcite . as a corollary",
    ", the magnitude level of the hb in @xmath17 has also been measured ; it provides a reference for gc distance estimates as discussed below .",
    "the mean level of the horizontal part of the hb was measured from the acs survey data relative to the hb of m  5 ( ngc  5904 ) .",
    "m  5 has a well - populated hb that extends approximately 0.7 mag in @xmath30 from the red side to the blue and , therefore , can overlay the hb of almost any other gc .",
    "measurements were made by matching the cmd of each gc to that of m  5 in the region of the hb by making vertical and horizontal adjustments to the comparison cmd until it most closely overlaid that of m  5 . in the majority of cases ,",
    "the comparison gc had enough overlap to make the best alignment unambiguous .",
    "a few clusters with purely blue hbs , such as ngc  6254 , present some difficulty because even the reddest hb stars do not become ` horizontal ' .",
    "the measured hb levels are listed in table [ morph ] .",
    "typical measurement uncertainties are @xmath10.05 mag and are dominated by the uncertainty inherent in aligning the hbs .",
    "the formal photometric errors of most hb stars are a few thousandths of a magnitude .",
    "the uncertainty is larger in cases where differential reddening is significant or the hb is otherwise difficult to quantify . as an example , figure [ outline ] shows hb levels for ngc  1261 and m  92 ( ngc  6341 ) .",
    "measurements were obtained by drawing an outline around the hb and the rgb at the level of the hb and then calculating the statistics of the stars within each outline .",
    "this process is illustrated in figure [ outline ] for two gcs , ngc  1261 and m  92 .",
    "rr lyrae stars are not given special consideration in this analysis : they are included if they are present in the acs observations .",
    "for the acs survey data , all determinations of hb membership were performed in the acs @xmath30 cmd as shown in figure [ outline ] . in order to allow direct comparison with gcs observed in different bands ,",
    "the color difference presented in table [ morph ] is given in terms of @xmath31 rather than @xmath30 .",
    "this was achieved by transforming the acs magnitudes of each individual hb star into @xmath23 and @xmath32 using the equations provided by @xcite and then calculating the median @xmath31 values of the hb and rgb .",
    "the median was chosen to represent the central tendency of @xmath0 because the hb stars are not normally distributed in color space .",
    "hence , the more commonly - used mean and standard deviation are not the most appropriate choices .",
    "if the hb stars were normally distributed in color space , then the mean and median would be equal .",
    "in fact , about one half ( one quarter ) of the gcs in the sample have means and medians that differ by more than 5% ( 10% ) .",
    "for gcs with intermediate hbs , such as m  3 and ngc  1261 , the mean and median are substantially different .",
    "table [ morph ] provides the quantities used to determine @xmath0 .",
    "in addition to the median @xmath31 of the hb and rgb , 1-@xmath11 errors on these quantities are listed and the quadrature sum is given as the uncertainty on @xmath0 .",
    "uncertainty in the median @xmath31 was estimated by bootstrapping with replacements performed 10,000 times on both the hb and rgb of each gc .",
    "the error bars on the median represent the range of @xmath31 within which 68% of bootstrapped medians lie . to compliment the median and uncertainty , we also give the mean absolute deviation ( mad ) for the hb and rgb .",
    "the mean absolute deviation represents the intrinsic spread in each individual data set .",
    "consider , for example , the hbs of 47  tuc ( ngc  104 ) and m  3 ( ngc  5272 ) .",
    "both have well - populated hbs and thus small uncertainties , @xmath33 determined from bootstrapping , but 47  tuc has a tightly clustered red clump of hb stars and a small mad=0.023 while m  3 has a more broadly distributed hb and a larger mad=0.208 .",
    "perhaps the most frequently used hb morphology metric in the literature is ( b@xmath29r)/(b+v+r ) : the difference between the number of blue hb stars ( b ) and the number of red ( r ) normalized by the total number of hb stars including variables ( v ) .",
    "its major inconvenience is that it saturates if all stars lie on one side or the other of the instability strip .",
    "the left panel of figure [ dvibvr ] compares ( b@xmath29r)/(b+v+r ) from @xcite and @xmath0 from this paper for the 66 gcs in the present sample .",
    "there is an obvious correlation between the two but @xmath0 continues to vary after ( b@xmath29r)/(b+v+r ) saturates .    the most recent large - scale study of hb morphology , that of @xcite , used the maximum effective temperature encountered along the hb [ log  @xmath34 determined with the use of theoretical zero - age hb sequences from @xcite .",
    "the log  @xmath35 metric appears to be complimentary to @xmath0 or ( b@xmath29r)/(b+v+r ) because , while it lacks sensitivity through the middle , it is more sensitive at the extremes .",
    "this is demonstrated in the right panel of figure [ dvibvr ] . in the absence of an ideal hb morphology metric that quantifies every feature of interest , it is beneficial to identify a metric that is well suited to a particular problem .",
    "* paper vii ) presented relative ages measured from the acs survey data .",
    "these ages were derived by first measuring the absolute magnitudes of the main sequence turnoffs ( mstos ) for all gcs and then interpolating in isochrone - based grids of msto as a function of age and metallicity .",
    "the same analysis was performed with four different isochrone libraries and the distribution of relative ages with metallicity was shown to be independent of the isochrone library .",
    "for the purpose of the present paper , relative ages derived from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper ii ) isochrones using the ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter zw84 ) metallicity scale have been adopted .",
    "furthermore , we assumed that gcs with @xmath36 } } < -1 $ ] have [ @xmath37/fe]=+0.3 and gcs with @xmath36}}\\geq -1 $ ] have [ @xmath37/fe]=+0.2 .",
    "the ages measured in this fashion and with these assumptions were placed on a relative scale by dividing out the average age of the most metal - poor gcs ( [ fe / h ] @xmath38 ) , in this case 13.3 gyr . in the present study ,",
    "this factor has been retained , resulting in absolute ages for the particular isochrone library , metallicity scale , and method of age determination employed in paper vii .      in order to put the acs survey ages on the same scale as the six outer halo gcs , and to demonstrate that later results do not depend on the method used , age estimates were determined using isochrone fitting to the cmds of all gcs in the data set .",
    "the fits were performed using isochrones from paper ii for the acs survey data and @xcite for the outer halo gcs .",
    "the same zeropoint corrections applied to the acs data , as described in @xmath16[survey ] , were applied to the isochrones in the acs photometric system as well .",
    "the underlying luminosities , temperatures , surface gravities , and color transformations of the isochrones in paper ii and @xcite are identical .",
    "the only difference between the two is the photometric system .",
    "the outer halo gcs were measured in @xmath39 and @xmath18 , whereas the acs survey data were taken in @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "several gcs were excluded from isochrone fitting because they are known to harbor multiple stellar populations .",
    "the presence of more than one stellar population makes a single age determination insufficient to characterize the gc .",
    "ages were not determined for the following gcs : ngc  1851 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper iii ) , ngc  2808 @xcite , ngc  6388 , ngc  6441 , and ngc  6656 @xcite .",
    "it is likely that other gcs with multiple populations exist , even within the acs survey data , but to have avoided detection thus far the separation between the populations must either be so small that they overlap to a great extent or that reddening has obscured the separation in the cmd .",
    "a second population may also represent a small fraction of stars and have little or no apparent influence on the hb morphology .",
    "the recent discovery of a second subgiant branch in 47  tuc ( ngc  104 ) by @xcite is an example : this second population accounts for only @xmath110% of the stars in the core .",
    "further out , the cmd was too sparsely populated to detect this population .",
    "it should also be noted that @xcite found the main population of 47  tuc to have a spread in the cmd greater than can be accounted for by the photometric errors .",
    "the authors found it unlikely that this spread was due to binaries , differential reddening , or a depth effect .",
    "@xcite explored the possibility that the color spread could be caused by an intrinsic variation in the he abundance or @xmath6}}$ ] .",
    "another case is m  4 ( ngc  6121 ) .",
    "@xcite presented spectroscopic evidence for a bimodal abundance distribution along the rgb of m  4 as well as a broadening of the rgb in @xmath40 . whether m  4 contains two distinct stellar populations or a continuous distribution is not clear at present .",
    "if it is the former , the difference is small enough to remain undetected on the main sequence in the exquisite photometry presented by @xcite .",
    "if it is the latter , age determinations are expected to be reasonable ( see the discussion at the end of @xmath16[metage ] ) .",
    "the procedure used to determine ages involved a two step process .",
    "initial estimates for @xmath6}}$ ] , distance modulus , and reddening estimates were taken from the @xcite catalog , 2003 revision .",
    "estimates of [ @xmath37/fe ] were chosen as appropriate for a given value of @xmath6}}$ ] .",
    "all efforts were made to follow these values as closely as possible with minor adjustments made to improve the fit to the unevolved main sequence first and the rgb second . in some instances , isochrones at the catalog values were not able to provide an adequate fit to the cmds and , in these cases , the initial estimates of @xmath6}}$ ] , distance , and reddening were allowed to vary until the fit obtained was acceptable .",
    "this step was a necessity in a number of cases because the published values for some lesser - known gcs are uncertain .",
    "for example , @xcite found that the main sequence and rgb morphologies of am-1 are comparable to those of m  3 although the former is listed at @xmath6}}=-1.8 $ ] while the latter is listed at @xmath6}}=-1.57 $ ] in the harris catalog .",
    "another example is the distance modulus of ngc  6254 : the harris catalog value is @xmath41 but the present study produces a value that is @xmath10.2 mag fainter .",
    "this result is confirmed by both isochrone fitting to the main sequence and the level of the hb from table [ morph ] .",
    "these results are not meant to diminish the value of the gc catalogs , which are invaluable resources , but merely to emphasize that there are still many gcs in the galaxy whose properties are poorly constrained .",
    "the models , which are homogeneous in terms of physical assumptions and ingredients , can prove useful in determining the relative differences between two gcs if one has well - measured properties and another does not .",
    "several of the gcs in the acs survey are heavily obscured by interstellar reddening .",
    "differential reddening confuses the age determinations in such gcs because the reddening line is nearly perpendicular to the most age - sensitive features : the main sequence turnoff and the subgiant branch .",
    "differential reddening causes these features to be spread out and , in light of this trend , we have attempted to correct for its effects in the following manner .",
    "the first step involves the construction of a fiducial sequence for the gc .",
    "the fiducial sequence is centered approximately at the msto .",
    "more stars lie below the msto than above but the differential corrections are weighted based on the angle between the stellar sequence and the reddening line . since the reddening line is almost perpendicular to the subgiant branch , the differential correction is approximately equally weighted by stars above and below the msto .",
    "care is taken to avoid unresolved binaries . from the fiducial sequence ,",

    "the best - fit age of a given gc was estimated by determining the isochrone that best fit the cmd from the msto through the subgiant branch .",

    "the range of ages that allowed the isochrones to envelope the bulk of the stars at the msto and on the subgiant branch are taken to be 1-@xmath11 uncertainties .",
    "the age uncertainty is only based on the fitting procedure described and does not account for uncertainties in the input physics of the stellar models or differences between the chemical composition assumed in the models and those actually present in the stars ( for more on this point , see @xmath16[metage ] ) .",
    "hence the uncertainties include the random component but exclude the systematic .",
    "still , it is worthwhile to consider that incomplete knowledge of chemical composition and incomplete treatment of the physics , such as rotation and convection , in the current generation of 1-d stellar evolution models are primary sources for the systematic error present in the analysis .",

    "furthermore , the majority of gc stars are in the intermediate group",
    ".    how do these findings influence gc age estimates ? @xcite compared stellar evolution models from the basti library @xcite with chemical compositions representative of the primordial and extreme groups .",
    "@xcite state that , as long as the total amount of c+n+o remains constant , it is safe to use @xmath37-enhanced isochrones to derive gc ages .",
    "however , if the total amount of c+n+o varies among the stars in a given gc , then it is necessary to use models with the appropriate cno abundances to derive gc ages .",
    "this is all without consideration of a potential change in the he content that is predicted to accompany the light element abundance variations .",
    "the he abundance is important because models of chemical enrichment in gcs predict that the abundance variations from the primordial values should be accompanied by an increase in he , whether the source of the enrichment is massive stars @xcite or intermediate mass agb stars @xcite .",
    "the extreme stars should be most he - enriched , the intermediate stars should be slightly he - enriched , and the primordial stars should have primordial he .",
    "@xcite investigated the he content of 57 gcs using the r parameter : the ratio of the number of hb stars to the number of rgb stars brighter than the hb . within the uncertainties , they found little or no evidence for a spread in the he content of gcs with ( b@xmath29r)/(b+v+r ) @xmath53 0.8 . for gcs with ( b@xmath29r)/(b+v+r )",
    "@xmath54 0.8 , @xcite found a larger spread and a tendency toward higher he abundances .",
    "these authors state that the apparent trend towards higher he abundances in gcs with blue hbs may be related to increased evolutionary timescales for the lowest mass hb stars not entirely accounted for in their calibration of the r parameter or the genuine presence of he - rich stars in the blue hbs of some gcs . as long as the total metal content remains constant ,",
    "a modest spread ( @xmath8y @xmath55 0.05 ) in the he content of a gc will not significantly alter the level of the main sequence turnoff or subgiant branch @xcite and therefore not confuse the age determination .",
    "if the total metal content varies or the spread in he is larger , age estimates will require great care and detailed abundance information .",

    "the primary reason for disagreement in ages is most likely the adopted metallicity scale since the largest systematic deviation occurs around [ m / h]@xmath58 and the metallicity scales deviate there by as much as 0.3 dex ( see figure [ met ] ) .",

    "the error bars shown are only due to measurement errors in @xmath0 as listed in table [ morph ] .    in order to more clearly identify the second parameter",
    ", an attempt was made to remove the influence of metallicity from the hb morphology data , thereby exposing the second parameter effect . to accomplish this ,",
    "a function was fit to the inner halo gcs which cover the full range of metallicity and exhibit relatively little scatter in the [ m / h]-@xmath0 diagram , with the notable exception of ngc  6584 .",
    "ngc  6584 is presently located at @xmath62 kpc but @xcite noted its position in the metallicity - hb morphology diagram and large , positive heliocentric velocity and suggested it is actually an outer halo gc .",

    "m  5 ( see @xmath16[intro ] ) and ngc  6584 were excluded from the fit .",

    "the second part , @xmath67 , is a quadratic that allows for the remaining curvature , in particular that the most metal - poor gcs turn back to the red with decreasing metallicity as can be seen in figure [ dvimh ] .",

    "the fitting function coefficients are reproduced in table [ coeff ] .",
    "the search for correlations focuses on the difference between the measured @xmath0 of an outer halo gc and the @xmath0 value of the inner halo trend ( as represented by the fitting function ) at that gc s metallicity .",
    "this quantity will henceforth be referred to as @xmath72 .",
    "figure [ dhbmh ] shows how @xmath72 varies with metallicity ; the symbols are the same as in figure [ dvimh ] . with the exception of ngc  6584 the inner halo gcs exhibit residuals of @xmath10.1 or less .",
    "altogether , metal - rich gcs ( [ m / h]@xmath73 ) show very little scatter in figure [ dhbmh ] . evidently , metallicity alone is almost sufficient to describe the hb morphology of the majority of metal - rich gcs and thus they are of little use in the search for the second parameter .",
    "the solid error bars shown in figure [ dhbmh ] represent the measurement errors listed in table [ morph ] .",
    "metallicity uncertainty plays an important role in this diagram and thus the error bars in figure [ dhbmh ] are only a lower limit to the total uncertainty in @xmath0 .",
    "unfortunately , it is not possible to provide realistic metallicity errors for all of the gcs in the sample . for the large deviation shown for @xmath74 [ m / h ] @xmath75 in figure [ dhbmh ] to be completely erased , metallicities of the gcs in this region that stand out would have to be systematically under - estimated by 0.25 - 0.5 dex .",
    "such a conspiracy seems highly unlikely .",
    "however , it is possible to approximate the effect of metallicity errors on @xmath0 in the following manner .",
    "first , the fitting function described by equations [ fit1 ] and [ fit2 ] was applied to the inner halo gcs with metallicities on the ki03 scale .",
    "next , the ki03-based fitting function was used to calculate a @xmath0 but using the metallicity from table [ age ] or the zw84 scale , thereby introducing a metallicity error .",
    "finally , the difference between the erroneous @xmath0 value obtained in this manner and the value obtained from the appropriate fitting function provides an estimate of how a metallicity error propagates into a @xmath0 error .    under the hypothesis that the ki03 @xmath6}}$ ] scale is the ` correct ' one , this procedure gives an indication of how a metallicity error ( a vertical displacement in figure [ dvimh ] ) influences the significance of the distance between a gc and the inner halo fitting function ( the horizontal distance between a point and the fit line in figure [ dvimh ] ) which we refer to as @xmath72 . the dashed error bars in figure [ dhbmh ] are the quadrature sum of the @xmath0 measurement errors from table [ morph ] and the metallicity errors estimated as described in the preceding paragraph . the metallicity effect is small except in the vicinity of the transition from red to blue that occurs around [ m / h ] @xmath58 ( see figure [ dvimh ] ) where a small change in metallicity corresponds to a large change in @xmath0 .",
    "it should be stressed that this approach is not a rigorous treatment of the influence of metallicity uncertainty on @xmath0 or @xmath72 because it assumes the difference between one scale and another is the error .",
    "nevertheless , it serves to illustrate that the existence of several gcs with @xmath76 [ m / h ] @xmath77 and large , positive values of @xmath72 can not readily be attributed to metallicity errors alone .",
    "figures [ dhbrgc ] through [ dhbage ] show how the @xmath0 difference depends on @xmath4 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and age for the outer halo gcs . in order to quantify the information provided in the plots , spearman s rank correlation coefficient",
    "was calculated for the data presented in figures [ dhbrgc ] through [ dhbage ] and included in the figures .",
    "the spearman rank correlation coefficient ( spearman s @xmath78 ) measures the degree of correlation between two variables but makes no assumption about the functional form of their relationship other than monotonicity .",
    "as such , it is a very general measure of correlation ; a perfect correlation has a value of @xmath79 , a perfect anti - correlation has @xmath80 , and complete lack of correlation has @xmath81 .",
    "the left panels show the 6 most distant gcs , which were not part of the acs survey , as triangles .",
    "since these 6 gcs are not part of the homogeneous acs data set , and were not considered in paper vii , we have calculated the spearman correlation coefficients with and without them in the left panels .",
    "apart from ngc  2419 , the other 5 most distant gcs tend to strengthen the correlation coefficients because they are more distant , intrinsically fainter , more extended , and younger .",
    "@xmath0 error bars are included in figures [ dvimh ] through [ dhbage ] , and age errors in figure [ dhbage ] , but uncertainties in the other quantities are neither readily available nor simple to estimate given the wide range of distances and reddenings present in the sample .",
    "it is , however , important to consider that the quantities in figures [ dhbrgc ] through [ dhbrho ] were converted to physical units after adopting a particular distance modulus . as distance increases ,",
    "a given error in the distance corresponds to a larger uncertainty in the physical quantity .    while @xmath4 ,",
    "@xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 reveal no obvious visible trends , figure [ dhbage ] shows a trend with age .",
    "the spearman coefficients support this conclusion : @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 show no strong correlations .",
    "@xmath4 shows a mild correlation but that is mostly likely due to a large anti - correlation between age and @xmath4 .",
    "age shows a significant anti - correlation and the age trend works as anticipated : the hbs grow redder with decreasing age and so the distances between the measured @xmath0 values and the inner halo trend increase as age decreases .",
    "the results presented in this section demonstrate that , of all the parameters considered here , age has the most significant correlation with @xmath72 .",
    "figure [ dhbage ] and the accompanying slopes and coefficients do not include pal  12 or terzan  7 , the two youngest gcs in the sample",
    ". both gcs are metal rich and so their hb morphologies are almost entirely determined by their metallicity alone .",
    "the presence or absence of pal  12 and ter  7 does not significantly alter the correlation coefficients ( @xmath82 ) for any of the other quantities .",
    "figure [ dhbage ] also includes a linear fit to each data set that describes the rate at which hb morphology varies with age .",
    "the ages and metallicities listed in table [ age ] suggest that hb morphology changes over a smaller age interval than those from paper vii , but only by about @xmath10.5 gyr .",
    "the larger errors that include the metallicity effect were not used in the least squares fits to the age-@xmath72 relations shown in figure [ dhbage ] .",
    "if they had been , the slope of the relation derived using the paper vii ages ( shown in the right panel ) would be reduced to @xmath83 while the slope derived from the ages given in table [ age ] would not change significantly .      in @xmath16[2ndp ] , it was shown that when the inner halo relationship between metallicity and @xmath0 is subtracted from the outer halo gcs , a correlation between age and @xmath72 appears .",
    "the inner halo gcs were chosen to define the trend because they exhibit a tight relation with little scatter in the hb morphology",
    " metallicity diagram ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also figure [ dvimh ] in this paper ) .",
    "unfortunately , attempts to use this technique a second time  to subtract off the age trend  were unsuccessful because the remaining residuals are generally smaller than the measurement uncertainties in @xmath0 .",
    "thus , to identify a potential third parameter , it is necessary to remove the effect of metallicity and age to the fullest extent possible .",
    "the most metal poor gcs ( [ m / h ] @xmath84 ) in the sample are an ideal choice because they have a small range in ages ( @xmath16[gcages ] ) and only a weak metallicity dependence on hb morphology ( see figure [ dvimh ] ) .",
    "comparisons of the metal poor gcs @xmath72 values with @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 were performed . of these ,",
    "central density ( log  @xmath27 ) produced the most significant trend .",
    "figure [ rho ] demonstrates how central density relates to @xmath72 among the metal poor gcs using the two fitting functions employed in @xmath16[2ndp ] and the same symbols used in figures [ dvimh ] through [ dhbage ] .",
    "there is an evident trend with the highest central density gcs having the bluest hb morphologies and hence the smallest @xmath72 values . assuming that the contributions of age and metallicity are minimal in figure [ rho ] , the influence that central density has on hb morphology in the metal poor gcs is evident and its magnitude is @xmath85 in @xmath72 .",
    "although it is difficult to disentangle the effects of age and central density in gcs with intermediate metallicities ( @xmath74 [ m / h ] @xmath75 ) , where the second parameter is most pronounced , these gcs span essentially the same range of central densities as the metal poor gcs .",
    "thus central density should only account for a small portion of the hb morphology variation seen in the intermediate metallicity group .",
    "the influence of central density on hb morphology has already been demonstrated by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "however , its effect is not as pronounced as that of age ( compare figures [ dhbage ] and [ rho ] ) .",
    "therefore central density is the most likely candidate for the third parameter influencing hb morphology ( as characterized by @xmath0 ) that has been considered by this study .",
    "it is worthwhile to demonstrate that the use of the inner halo gcs to define the hb morphology ",
    "metallicity relation does not include an unintended bias .",
    "in particular , since claims have been made in the preceding sections that , after metallicity , age and central density are the two most significant factors influencing hb morphology [ as represented by @xmath0 ] , it is important to demonstrate that the hb morphology  metallicity trend derived from the inner halo gcs does not include an implicit dependence on either of these quantities .",
    "indeed , as figure [ inner ] shows , the inner halo gcs exhibit some dispersion inside 8 kpc in both central density ( left panel ) and age ( right panel ) but there is no clear , systematic variation of either parameter as a function of @xmath4 inside 8 kpc ( denoted by the dotted line in the figure ) .    figure [ dvimh ] demonstrates that the hb morphologies of the inner halo gcs , which have a fairly homogeneous age distribution , transition from blue to red as [ m / h ] rises through @xmath58 .",
    "the metal rich gcs have red hbs ( though ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 also have blue extensions ) while the majority of metal poor gcs have blue hbs .",
    "it is at metallicities that are lower than , but within a few tenths of a dex of , [ m / h]=@xmath87 where a gc is most likely to move a large distance in the @xmath0metallicity diagram due to a relatively small change in metallicity or another parameter .",
    "it is within this same narrow metallicity range that the amr of the outer halo gcs branches off from that of the inner halo gcs ( see figure [ amr ] ) and so it is no coincidence that the classic second parameter effect is most pronounced in the outer halo .",
    "the analysis presented in @xmath16[2ndp ] indicates that a gc with @xmath74[m / h]@xmath75 requires 2 - 2.5 gyr to transition from a red hb to a blue one .",
    "this result is consistent with a number of studies mentioned in the introduction .",
    "we confirm the assertion by @xcite that the presence of metal poor gcs with red hbs at large @xmath4 is primarily an age effect .",
    "however , our result indicates that lee et al.s claim that the necessary age difference is greater than @xmath13 gyr is slightly exaggerated . that a gc with @xmath74 [ m / h ] @xmath75 transitions from a red to a blue hb in 2 - 2.5 gyr poses a challenge to our understanding of mass loss during the red giant phase of evolution .",
    "rgb mass loss has been essentially a free parameter in synthetic hb models since they were first constructed by @xcite .",
    "a number of mass loss rates that vary as a function of global stellar properties such as luminosity , mass , radius , or some combination of the three have been proposed with varying degrees of success , see @xcite for a detailed discussion . following @xcite , @xcite showed that a simple relationship between global metallicity and average rgb mass loss , along with stochastic variations , can reproduce the general trend observed in old , roughly coeval galactic gcs in the hb morphology - metallicity diagram .",
    "recent progress from observations by , e.g.@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , should lead to a better understanding of rgb mass loss as a function of composition , evolutionary status , and pulsational properties .",
    "the recent , large - scale study of hb morphology by @xcite suggests that , just as age can explain anomalously red hbs in some gcs , total gc mass is linked to the degree of abundance variation and the extent of the faint blue tail observed in other gcs .",
    "( of course , there is no reason why both effects can not be operating in the same gc . )",
    "recall that figure [ dvibvr ] showed the hb morphology metric adopted by @xcite was very sensitive to the extremes but lacked sensitivity through the middle of the distribution . in the absence of an ideal hb morphology metric , a large - scale study of hb morphology should choose a metric that is well - suited to the effect(s ) of interest to that investigation .",
    "hb morphologies characterized by @xmath0 of 66 galactic gcs were examined to determine the sensitivity of hb morphology to a variety of different factors .",
    "deep , homogeneous photometry from the acs survey of galactic gcs accounts for 60 of these while the remaining 6 gcs are the most distant galactic gcs known .",
    "the complete sample is the largest examined to date and consists solely of high - quality hst photometry .",
    "it spans the full range of @xmath4 and almost the entire range of metallicity present in the galactic gc population .",
    "@xmath0 values and two independently measured sets of ages were joined with other quantities from the literature to assess the relative importance of these quantities on hb morphology .",
    "the data were split into two groups , roughly equal in number , based on @xmath4 .",
    "the tight relationship between metallicity and hb morphology in the inner halo group ( @xmath13 kpc ) was characterized by a fitting function and this trend was subtracted off of the outer halo group . the difference between fit and measured @xmath0",
    "was then compared to a variety of parameters , of which only age showed a significant correlation .",
    "the age correlation does not rely on the presence of the 6 most distant gcs in the analysis , though their presence does strengthen the result .",
    "hence we conclude that , after metallicity , age has the most influence on @xmath0 .",
    "the age spread among the bulk of gcs in the galactic halo was found to be 2 - 2.5 gyr , though there are a few younger outliers such as pal  12 and ter  7 .",
    "further analysis , in which both metallicity and age were restricted , provided strong evidence that central luminosity density ( @xmath27 ) is the third most influential parameter on @xmath0 .",
    "we wish to express our gratitude to the anonymous referee for a thoughtful , thorough report that improved the accuracy and focus of the paper .",

    "<S> the horizontal branch ( hb ) morphology of globular clusters ( gcs ) is most strongly influenced by metallicity . </S>",
    "<S> the second parameter phenomenon , first described in the 1960 s , acknowledges that metallicity alone is not enough to describe the hb morphology of all gcs . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , astronomers noticed that the outer galactic halo contains gcs with redder hbs at a given metallicity than are found inside the solar circle . </S>",
    "<S> thus , at least a second parameter was required to characterize hb morphology . </S>",
    "<S> while the term ` second parameter ' has since come to be used in a broader context , its identity with respect to the original problem has not been conclusively determined . </S>",
    "<S> here we analyze the median color difference between the hb and the red giant branch ( rgb ) , hereafter denoted @xmath0 , measured from hubble space telescope ( hst ) advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) photometry of 60 gcs within @xmath120 kpc of the galactic center . </S>",
    "<S> analysis of this homogeneous data set reveals that , after the influence of metallicity has been removed from the data , the correlation between @xmath0 and age is stronger than that of any other parameter considered . expanding the sample to include hst acs and wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) photometry of the 6 most distant galactic gcs lends additional support to the correlation between @xmath0 and age . </S>",
    "<S> this result is robust with respect to the adopted metallicity scale and the method of age determination , but must bear the caveat that high quality , detailed abundance information is not available for a significant fraction of the sample . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , when a subset of gcs with similar metallicities and ages are considered , a correlation between @xmath0 and central luminosity density is exposed . with respect to the existence of gcs with anomalously red hbs at a given metallicity </S>",
    "<S> , we conclude that age is the second parameter and central density is most likely the third . </S>",
    "<S> important problems related to hb morphology in gcs , notably multi - modal distributions and faint blue tails , remain to be explained . </S>"
