    "the stability of general relativity ( gr ) predictions against small graviton mass has been a persistent challenge of classical field theory . the simplest ghost - free extension of gr with a linear mass term",
    "@xcite suffers from the van dam - veltman - zakharov discontinuity , giving rise to different predictions for the classical tests in the vanishing mass limit @xcite .",
    "although this problem can be alleviated by nonlinear terms @xcite , the cost is the emergence of the boulware - deser ( bd ) ghost @xcite , which is generically unavoidable due to six degrees of freedom in the metric instead of the five of the massive spin 2 field .    adopting an effective field theory approach in the decoupling limit , the source of all the above issues can be traced back to the helicity 0 mode of the graviton @xcite . in this perspective",
    ", an analogue of the cancellation of the bd ghost in the linear theory by a specific choice of the mass term can be performed , rendering the nonlinear theory ghost - free up to quartic order by tuning the coefficients @xcite .",
    "more recently , a two parameter theory of nonlinear massive gravity was developed @xcite . in this construction , terms to each order are chosen to remove the additional degree of freedom ( would - be bd ghost ) at the decoupling limit and it has the potential to be free of the bd ghost at fully nonlinear level @xcite .",
    "the more general construction with dynamical auxiliary metrics was also claimed to be free from the bd ghost at fully nonlinear order @xcite .",
    "the massive extensions of gr are known to allow self - accelerating solutions @xcite .",
    "this provides an application opportunity for the recent formulations of massive gravity , as an alternative approach to account for the current accelerated expansion . on the other hand , to model the accelerating universe in the scope of this infrared modified gravity theory ,",
    "a cosmological solution is necessary . in the construction of @xcite with minkowski fiducial metric , flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe",
    "can not be realized @xcite , although cosmological solutions with negative spatial curvature exist @xcite . for more general constructions with a nondynamical @xcite and dynamical @xcite auxiliary metrics , maximally symmetric frw with either curvature may be allowed .",
    "given the nontrivial cosmological solutions which self - accelerate , it is thus a necessity to understand their properties against perturbations .",
    "in the light of the construction which removes the additional degree ( would - be bd ghost ) , the expectation is to have five degrees of freedom associated with the five polarizations of the massive graviton . on the other hand",
    ", the absence of bd ghost does not guarantee that the theory is safe ; one still needs to determine the conditions under which the helicity 0 and 1 modes , which are pure gauge in the massless theory , are stable @xcite .",
    "furthermore , these additional degrees should not be in conflict with observations .",
    "for instance , because of the emergence of a new scalar degree in the gravity sector , the newtonian potential may acquire modifications from couplings between the matter sector and the helicity 0 graviton .",
    "if this is the case , the parameters of the theory can be restricted by e.g. the solar system tests",
    ".    the primary goal of the present paper is to address these questions .",
    "we consider the cosmological solutions in massive gravity as background and in the presence of a generic matter content , we present a gauge invariant formulation of perturbations .",
    "although as we argued above , we expect the gravity sector to contain @xmath1 dynamical degrees of freedom , at the level of the quadratic action , we show that the helicity 0 and 1 graviton modes have vanishing kinetic terms but finite masses . as a result , in addition to the matter perturbations , the only dynamical degrees of freedom are the two tensor polarizations of gravity waves .",
    "this is exactly the same number of degrees of freedom as in gr . for the action quadratic in perturbations around the cosmological backgrounds , the mass terms of the potentially ghost - free construction turn out to be completely decoupled from the standard part ( einstein - hilbert and matter terms ) for scalar and vector modes .",
    "thus , these modes evolve identically to their counterparts in gr , except for the additional cosmological constant contributed by the graviton mass .",
    "the only non trivial effect on the dynamics occurs in the tensor modes , which acquires a time dependent mass term determined by the fiducial metric of the theory .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we review the setup with a fiducial metric that is minkowski and summarize the only cosmological solution @xcite allowed in this case . in section iii",
    ", we give a detailed study of the complete quadratic action for perturbations in the presence of a general fiducial metric of the frw form , with an ansatz for the physical background metric also of frw type with arbitrary spatial curvature . as an example , we specify to perturbations around the open universe solution @xcite driven by a single scalar field matter in section iv .",
    "we conclude with section v , where we summarize our results .",
    "the paper is supplemented by a number of appendices , where the details of calculations are presented .",
    "in this section , we review the open frw universe solution @xcite in nonlinear massive gravity @xcite coupled to general matter content .    the covariant action for the gravity sector is constructed out of the four dimensional metric @xmath2 and the four scalar fields @xmath3 called _ stckelberg fields_. the action respects the poincare symmetry in the field space , i.e. invariance under the constant shift of each of @xmath4 and the lorentz transformation mixing them : @xmath5 the following line element in the field space is invariant under these transformations .",
    "@xmath6 indeed , this is the unique geometrical quantity in the field space of @xmath4 . thus the action can depend on @xmath4 only through the spacetime tensor @xmath7 in this language , general covariance is spontaneously broken by the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of @xmath8 . by assumption ,",

    "thus , in order to find frw cosmological solutions in this theory , we should adopt an ansatz in which not only @xmath2 but also @xmath8 respects the symmetry of the frw universes  @xcite . since the tensor @xmath8 is the pullback of the minkowski metric in the field space to the physical spacetime ,",
    "construction of such an ansatz is equivalent to finding a flat , closed , or open frw coordinate system for the minkowski line element .",
    "it is well known that the minkowski line element does not admit a closed frw chart but allows an open frw chart . for this reason , in order to find open frw solutions @xcite , we first perform the field redefinition from @xmath4 to new fields @xmath20 so that @xmath8 written in terms of @xmath20 manifestly has the symmetry of open frw universes as @xmath21 where @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the metric of the maximally symmetric space with the curvature constant @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) . concretely ,",

    "in the context of the potentially ghost - free , nonlinear massive gravity @xcite and for a general fiducial metric of frw form , we analyzed linear perturbations around self - accelerating cosmological solutions of arbitrary spatial curvature , populated by generic matter content that is minimally coupled to gravity . by constructing a gauge invariant formulation of perturbations",

    "this conclusion does not hold in the nontrivial cosmological branches of the nonlinear massive gravity . indeed , as stated above , the scalar and vector modes have vanishing kinetic terms and nonzero mass terms for any frw background .",
    "this sharp contrast to the linear ( fierz - pauli ) massive gravity stems from a peculiar structure of the graviton mass term expanded up to the quadratic order in perturbations : it depends only on the ( @xmath213)-components of metric perturbations and thus are independent of ( @xmath214 ) and ( @xmath215)-components . this lorentz - violating structure is possible because the vev of @xmath8 in the cosmological branches spontaneously breaks diffeomorphism invariance in a nontrivial way .",
    "it is still fair to say that the nature of the cancellation of the kinetic terms in the quadratic action of scalar and vector sectors is not well understood .",
    "this may be an indication that these sectors exhibit an infinitely strong coupling .",

    "we can safely integrate out those extra modes and trust the resulting low energy effective theory . in order to establish the fate of those extra degrees of freedom , i.e to judge whether they are strongly - coupled or non - dynamical ,",
    "the linear perturbation theory is not sufficient and nonlinear methods are needed .",
    "this study is beyond the scope of the present paper and is left for a future work .    on the other hand ,",
    "the modification in the tensor sector may leave a signature in the stochastic gravitational wave spectrum .",
    "the additional term in the mass of the tensor modes is time dependent , while its sign is determined by both the fiducial metric and the cosmological evolution .",
    "a positive but large contribution may give rise to a suppression of the gravity waves and a null signal in the large scale tensor - to - scalar ratio .",
    "however , this deviation from scale invariance may allow the signal at small scales to be potentially observable in the space - based gravity wave observatories such as decigo @xcite , bbo @xcite and lisa @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the present analysis is purely classical and special care is needed when discussing the evolution of cosmological perturbations which start off in quantum mechanical vacuum . in order to address quantum issues such as the radiative stability of the structure of the effective theory describing cosmological perturbations ,",
    "one of the first important steps is to identify the strong coupling scale below which the nonlinear massive gravity theory can be trusted . in the branch described by the trivial solution to the stckelberg equation of motion ( [ eqn : constraintf ] ) , the so called decoupling limit has been useful for this purpose .",
    "however , since this trivial branch is not compatible with frw cosmologies , in the present paper we have considered other two branches described by non - trivial solutions ( [ eq : fsolcosmo ] ) . in these cosmological branches ,",
    "the usual decoupling limit is not applicable , at least apparently .",
