    "clusters of galaxies are the largest gravitationally bound systems in the universe .",

    ", clusters of galaxies are formed by the gravitational merger of smaller units e.g. groups and sub - clusters .",
    "such mergers are spectacular events involving kinetic energies as large as @xmath16 ergs . in these mergers a large portion of energy is dissipated in the icm , generating shock , turbulence and bulk motions , and heating it .",
    "substructure in the x - ray images as well as complex gas temperature gradients are all signatures of cluster mergers .    a significant fraction of clusters of galaxies shows the x - ray surface brightness strongly peaked at the center .",
    "this implies a high density , and cooling times of the hot icm within the inner @xmath17 100 kpc of much less than the hubble time . to maintain hydrostatic equilibrium , an inward flow may be required .",
    "x - ray observations with _ xmm - newton _ indicate no spectral evidence for large amounts of cooling and condensing gas in the centers of galaxy clusters believed to harbour strong cooling flows .",
    "the cooling flow seems to be hindered by some mechanism , whose nature is still debated .",
    "thus , there is no consensus on the actual existence of material `` cooling '' and `` flowing '' .",
    "what is generally agreed upon is that cooling core clusters are more dynamically relaxed than non cooling core clusters , which often show evidence of cluster merger .",
    "one of the most important results obtained with the _ chandra _ satellite on clusters of galaxies was the discovery of sharp surface brightness discontinuities in the images of merging clusters , called `` cold fronts '' .",
    "initially , one might have suspected these features to be merger shocks but spectral measurements showed that these are a new kind of structure .",
    "these cold fronts are apparently contact discontinuities between the gas which was in the cool core of one of the merging sub - clusters and the surrounding intracluster gas .",
    "cold fronts and merger shocks offer unique insights into the cluster physics , including the determination of the gas bulk velocity , its acceleration , the growth of plasma instabilities , the strength and structure of magnetic fields and the thermal conductivity .",
    "a precise physical description of the icm necessitates also adequate knowledge of the role of non - thermal components .",
    "the most detailed evidence for these phenomena comes from the radio observations .",
    "a number of clusters of galaxies is known to contain wide diffuse synchrotron sources ( radio halos , relics and mini - halos ) which have no obvious connection with the cluster galaxies , but are rather associated with the icm .",
    "the synchrotron emission of such sources requires a population of @xmath18 gev relativistic electrons and cluster magnetic fields on @xmath0 g levels . an indirect evidence of the existence of cluster magnetic fields is also derived from studies of the rotation measure of radio galaxies located within or behind clusters of galaxies .    a probe of the existence of a population of relativistic electrons in the icm is also obtained from the detection of non - thermal emission of inverse compton origin in the hard x - ray and possibly in the extreme ultraviolet wavelengths .",
    "the combination of the observed diffuse radio and hard x - ray emissions from clusters of galaxies is used to estimate the intracluster magnetic field strengths .",
    "the synchrotron emission is produced by the spiraling motion of relativistic electrons in a magnetic field .",

    "radio halos have been studied in x - ray luminous clusters such as a2163@xcite and 1e0657 - 57@xcite , and in distant clusters , such as a2744@xcite ( z = 0.308 ) , and cl0016 + 16@xcite ( z = 0.5545 ) .",
    "the latter is the most distant cluster with a radio halo known so far .",

    "the interpretation of these low polarization levels is that the thermal gas has become mixed with the relativistic plasma , thus internal depolarization occurs within the radio emitting plasma .",
    "in addition , the magnetic field may be disordered on scales smaller than the observing beam , thus producing significant beam depolarization .",
    "due to their low surface brightness , radio halos have been studied so far with low spatial resolution .",
    "this prevents a detailed investigation of the small - scale magnetic field geometry and intensity . using minimum energy assumptions ( see sec .",

    "in the equipartition approximation , a homogeneous cluster magnetic field is assumed , but this is probably a too simple picture .",
    "important clues about a radial decrease of the magnetic field strength in clusters of galaxies are given in sec .",
    "several models for the origin of the relativistic radiating electrons in the icm have been proposed ( see , e.g. , recent reviews@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these can be basically divided in two different scenarios : + @xmath177 _ primary electron _",
    "models@xcite in which relativistic electrons are injected in the icm from agn activity ( quasar , radio galaxies , etc . ) and/or from star formation in galaxies ( supernovae , galactic winds , etc . ) .",

    "the production of relativistic electrons by secondary models predict large gamma - ray fluxes from neutral pion decay which could be tested by future gamma - ray missions .",

    "+ iii ) halos are present in rich clusters , characterized by high x - ray luminosities and temperatures@xcite .",

    ", mergers can indeed supply enough kinetic energy for the maintenance of a radio halo , as first suggested by harris et al.@xcite .",
    "the observed link between radio halos and cluster mergers is in favor of primary electron models .",
    "these are also supported by the high frequency steepening of the integrated radio spectra ( e.g. in coma c@xcite ) and by the radial steepening of the two - frequency spectra in coma c@xcite , a665@xcite and a2163@xcite .",
    "these spectral behaviors can be easily reproduced by models invoking reacceleration of particles . on the contrary , they are difficult to explain by models considering secondary electron populations .",
    "radio relics are a class of diffuse sources typically located near the periphery of the cluster .",
    "unlike the halos , they show an elongated or irregular shape and are strongly polarized .",
    "the prototype of this class is 1253 + 275 , in the coma cluster ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , first classified by ballarati et al.@xcite .",
    "the polarization of 1253 + 275 at 20 cm is @xmath184%@xcite .",
    "the magnetic field is oriented along the source major axis and the magnetic field strength derived from minimum energy arguments of the synchrotron emitting plasma is 0.55 @xmath185 .    a complex radio emission is detected in a2256@xcite , which contains several head - tail radio galaxies , two large regions of diffuse radio relic emission and a central radio halo .",
    "the relics are highly polarized@xcite , with the linear fractional polarization at 20 cm above 30% for the majority of the region , reaching values up to 50% .",
    "the intrinsic magnetic field direction reveals that there is a large - scale order to the fields , and it appears to trace the bright filaments in the relics .",
    "in addition to coma and a2256 , other clusters present both a central halo and a peripheral relic , e.g. a2255@xcite , a1300@xcite , a2744@xcite and a754@xcite .",
    "a spectacular example of two almost symmetric relics in the same cluster is found in a3667@xcite .",
    "a puzzling relic source is 0917 + 75@xcite , located at 5 to 8 mpc from the centers of the closest clusters ( a762 , a786 , a787 ) , thus not unambiguously associated with any of them .",
    "it has a high fractional polarization ( up to 48% at 20 cm and 60% at 6 cm for the brightest parts of the source ) and",

    "we note , however , that they refer to regions where the cluster magnetic fields are expected to be compressed ( see below ) , thus they are not indicative of the overall magnetic field intensity in the peripheral cluster regions .    in recent years",
    ", there has been increasing evidence that the relics are related to ongoing merger events .",
    "it has been suggested that relics result from first order fermi acceleration of relativistic particles in shocks produced during cluster merger events@xcite .",
    "enlin and brggen@xcite presented 3-d magneto hydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations of electrons reaccelerated by adiabatic compression@xcite of existing cocoons of radio plasma that traverses a shock wave .",
    "the passage of a radio cocoon through a shock wave and the consequent evolution of the gas density and magnetic field energy density can be seen in fig .",
    "this model is consistent with the relic elongated structure almost perpendicular to the merger axis .",
    "moreover , the derived maps obtained in the simulations reproduce very well the filamentary structure seen in relic sources at high resolution@xcite",
    ".    the observed high polarization fraction of the relics should result from the compression of the wave , which aligns unordered magnetic fields with the shock front .",
    "due to the low gas density , a low faraday effect is expected at the cluster periphery , even in the presence of a tangled magnetic field .",
    "there are a few clusters where the relativistic electrons can be traced out quite far from the central galaxy , forming what is called mini - halo .",
    "mini - halos are diffuse steep - spectrum radio sources , extended on a moderate scale ( up to @xmath17 500 kpc ) , surrounding a dominant radio galaxy at the cluster center . unlike radio halos and relics , mini - halos are not tied to on - going merger events in clusters , as they are typically found at the center of cooling core , i.e relaxed , clusters .",
    "the prototype example of a mini - halo is at the center of the perseus cluster .",
    "the size is @xmath1 450 kpc , with no significant polarization@xcite . the strong polarized emission , detected through the entire cluster at 92 cm , at a faraday depth ( @xmath187 rad m@xmath2 ) higher than the galactic contribution seems not to be related to the mini - halo@xcite .",
    "other examples of mini - halos are in @xmath188@xcite , virgo@xcite , and possibly a2390@xcite .",
    "the mini - halo in a2390 is polarized at levels of @xmath189% .",
    "gitti et al.@xcite suggested that the electrons of the perseus mini - halo can not be supplied by the central radio galaxy , but are continuously undergoing reacceleration due to the mhd turbulence associated with the cooling flow region .",
    "they show that an isotropic magnetic field compression@xcite appears to well reproduce the observed surface brightness profile and total synchrotron spectrum along with the radial spectral steepening . on the other hand",
    "the radial compression of the magnetic field@xcite does not appear to be applicable to the mini - halo in the perseus cluster .",
    "the above model was successfully applied also to the mini - halo in a2626@xcite .",
    "pfrommer and enlin@xcite , on the other hand , discussed the possibility that relativistic electrons in mini - halos are of secondary origin and thus produced from the interaction of cosmic ray protons with the ambient thermal protons .",
    "recent attempts to detect intergalactic magnetic fields beyond clusters , i.e. in even more rarefied regions of the intergalactic space , have shown recent promise in imaging diffuse synchrotron radiation of very low level .",

    "these data may indicate the existence of a more widespread and somewhat lower intergalactic magnetic field than in the icm .",

    "the detection in a2199 , which is a cooling core cluster with no extended diffuse radio emission , is controversial@xcite .",
    "a marginal detection has been obtained in a119@xcite , a merging cluster without a radio halo , but the presence of several point sources in the field of view makes the ic interpretation unlikely .    for the clusters a3667@xcite and a2163@xcite only upper limits to the non - thermal x - ray emission have been derived . a possible detection in a2319 with rxte@xcite leads to a magnetic field of @xmath198 @xmath0 g .",
    "localized ic emission associated with the radio relic and with merger shocks in a85 has been claimed from rosat observations@xcite .",

    "therefore , alternative interpretations to the ic model for the non - thermal radiation detected in the coma cluster have been proposed .",
    "a suggested mechanism is the non - thermal bremsstrahlung from supra - thermal electrons formed through the current acceleration of the thermal gas@xcite .",
    "however , petrosian@xcite pointed out that due to the low efficiency of the bremsstrahlung mechanism , these models would require an unrealistically high energy input .",

    "9 that the disagreement between ic and rm magnetic field measurements can be at least partially alleviated .",
    "future studies of non - thermal x - ray emission in clusters will be possible with the _ astro - e2 _ satellite .",
    "one of the key techniques used to obtain information about the cluster magnetic fields strength and geometry is the faraday rotation analysis of radio sources in the background of clusters or in the galaxy clusters themselves .",
    "rm calculated from extragalactic radio sources can be considered as the sum of three integrals which represent the contribution of three different regions , namely internal to the source itself , due to our own galaxy , and occurring in the icm .",
    "the latter is the rm in which we are interested here .",
    "typical values of the rm of galactic origin are of the order of 10 rad m@xmath2 for most sources , and up to @xmath199 rad m@xmath2 for sources at low galactic latitudes@xcite . once the contribution of our galaxy is subtracted , however , the rm of radio galaxies located inside or behind clusters should be dominated by the contribution of the icm .",
    "high resolution rm studies of cygnus a@xcite were the first to demonstrate that the high rm values with large gradients on arcsec scales can not be either of galactic origin or due to a thermal gas mixed with the radio plasma , but must arise in an external screen of magnetized , ionized plasma .",
    "similarly , the asymmetric depolarization found in double radio lobes embedded in galaxy clusters can be understood as resulting from a difference in the faraday depth of the two lobes@xcite(laing - garrington effect ) .",
    "indeed , the radio source lobe pointing towards the observer is less depolarized than the lobe pointing away .    the observing strategy to get",
    "information on the cluster magnetic field intensity and structure is to obtain high resolution rm maps of sources located at different impact parameters of a cluster , then derive the average value of the rotation measure   and the value of its dispersion . as described in sec .",

    "for the magnetic field structure , they assumed the simple model with a single typical length for field reversal , i.e. a cluster field consisting of cells of uniform size , with the same electron density and magnetic field strength , but with a random field orientation .",
    "they obtained a cell size in the range 10 @xmath92 30 kpc . in the following year",
    ", kim et al.@xcite improved the statistics by analyzing a much larger sample of 106 radio sources , and deduced that magnetic fields strengths in the cluster gas are of the order of 1 @xmath0 g . in a more recent statistical study ,",

    "feretti et al.@xcite derived a magnetic field of 7 @xmath185 tangled on scales of @xmath1 1 kpc , in addition to a weaker field component of @xmath1 @xmath202 @xmath0 g , ordered on a scale of about one cluster core radius . generally , a decreasing   and   with an increasing projected distance from the cluster center is found .",

    "the data lead to magnetic field estimates of @xmath1 @xmath203 @xmath0 g , with patchy structures of @xmath1 @xmath204 kpc .",
    "overall , the data are consistent with cluster atmospheres containing @xmath0 g fields , with perhaps an order of magnitude scatter in field strength between clusters , or within a given cluster , and with extreme field values in cluster cooling cores .",
    "these estimates of the magnetic field strength from rm data crucially depend on the magnetic field structure and geometry .",
    "the rm distribution is generally patchy , indicating that large - scale magnetic fields are not regularly ordered on cluster scales , but have structures on scales as low as 10 kpc or less . in fig.[fig6 ] we show the rm images obtained for the two central radio galaxies in a119@xcite .    in many cases ,",
    "high resolution rm images show a nearly gaussian rm distribution , suggesting an isotropic distribution of the field component along the line - of - sight . however , many rm distributions show clear evidence for a non - zero mean   if averaged over areas comparable with the radio source size , even after the galactic contribution is subtracted .",
    "these   offsets are likely due to fluctuations of the cluster magnetic fields on scales greater than the typical source size , i.e. considerably larger than those responsible for the rm dispersion .",
    "the random magnetic field must therefore both be tangled on sufficiently small scales , in order to produce the smallest structures observed in the rm images and also fluctuate on scales one , or even two , orders of magnitude larger , to account for the non - zero rm average . for this reason ,",
    "it is necessary to consider cluster magnetic field models where both small and large scale structures coexist .",
    "so far very little attention has been given in the literature to the determination of the power spectrum of the intracluster magnetic field fluctuations .",
    "very recently enlin and vogt@xcite and vogt and enlin@xcite pointed out that the single scale cell model is not realistic because it does not satisfy the condition * div*@xmath21 = 0 . by using a semi - analytic technique",
    ", they showed that the magnetic field power spectrum can be estimated by fourier transforming rm maps if very detailed rm images are available .",
    "moreover , they derived that the autocorrelation length of the rm fluctuations is in general larger than the magnetic field autocorrelation length .    an alternative numerical approach to investigate the strength and structure of cluster magnetic fields through monte carlo simulations is presented in murgia et al.@xcite .",
    "a brief description of the capability of such a numerical approach is presented in sec .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that some authors have suggested the possibility that the rm observed in radio galaxies is not associated with the foreground icm , but may arise locally to the radio source@xcite , either in a thin skin of dense warm gas mixed along the edge of the radio emitting plasma , or in its immediate surroundings .",
    "there are , however , several arguments against this interpretation : + i ) the trends of rm versus the cluster impact parameter in both statistical studies and individual cluster investigations , + ii ) the relation between the rm and the cooling flow rate in relaxed clusters@xcite , + iii ) the laing - garrington effect@xcite , + iv ) statistical tests on the scatter plot of rm versus polarization angle , for the radio galaxy pks1246 - 410 @xcite , + v ) the very consistent scenario drawn by all the results presented in this section .",
    "+ thus , we conclude that local effects might give some contribution to the rm , however the major factor responsible for the faraday rotation should be the icm .",
    "future high resolution rm studies with the next generation radio telescopes ( e.g. evla , lofar , ska ) should help in distinguishing the local effects , as well as possible effects arising internally to the radio sources .",
    "the high sensitivity and resolution of the _ chandra _ satellite has allowed the detection in the clusters a2142 and a3667 of sharp discontinuities in the x - ray surface brightness , the so called cold fronts@xcite .",
    "ettori and fabian@xcite pointed out that the observed temperature jumps in a2142 require that thermal conduction across cold fronts must be suppressed by a factor of 100 or more , compared to the classical spitzer value@xcite .",
    "actually , a tangled magnetic field has been found@xcite to reduce the thermal conductivity from the spitzer value by a factor of order 10@xmath114 - 10@xmath205 .",
    "similar features have now been detected in several other clusters@xcite .",
    "these structures are apparently contact discontinuities between the gas which was in the cool core of one of the merging sub - clusters and the surrounding intracluster gas .",
    "they are not shocks because the density increase across the front is accompanied by a temperature decrease such that there is no dramatic change in the pressure and entropy .    in the cluster",
    "a3667@xcite ( see fig . [ fig7 ] ) , the temperature discontinuity in the cold front occurs over a scale of 3.5(@xmath17 4 kpc ) .",
    "vikhlinin et al.@xcite suggested that in order to reproduce such a sharp feature , magnetic fields are required to suppress both thermal conduction and kelvin - helmholtz instabilities along the contact discontinuity .",
    "they found that the front sharpness and its gradual smearing at large angles are most likely explained by the existence of a layer with a @xmath17 10 @xmath0 g magnetic field parallel to the front .",
    "the magnetic filed in the layer is probably amplified by the stretching of the field lines .",
    "the simplest model for a cluster magnetic field is a uniform field through the whole cluster .",
    "however , this is not realistic : if the field values detected at the cluster centers would extend over several core radii , up to distances of the order of @xmath1 mpc , the magnetic pressure would exceed the thermal pressure in the outer parts of the clusters .",
    "jaffe@xcite first suggested that the magnetic field distribution in a cluster would depend on the thermal gas density and on the distribution of massive galaxies and therefore would decline with the cluster radius .",
    "constraints to the radial gradient of the cluster magnetic field strength are provided by observations of clusters hosting a radio halo .",
    "indeed , the spatial correlation found in some clusters between the x - ray cluster brightness and the radio halo brightness@xcite implies that the energy densities in the thermal and non - thermal components have a similar radial scaling , thus a magnetic field decline is inferred .    a radial decrease of the cluster magnetic field strength is also deduced in the framework of halo formation models which consider the reacceleration of the radio emitting electrons .",
    "the radial steepening of the synchrotron spectrum , observed in coma@xcite and more recently in a665@xcite and a2163@xcite , is interpreted as the result of the combination of the magnetic field profile with the spatial distribution of the reacceleration efficiency , thus allowing us to set constraints on the radial profile of the cluster magnetic field . in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] we show the magnetic field profile in the coma cluster obtained by brunetti et al.@xcite by applying a model for the electron reacceleration .",
    "different lines refer to different values of the reacceleration coefficient .",
    "the dots represents the jaffe@xcite theoretical prediction .",
    "the field intensity is found to decrease smoothly from @xmath206 g at the cluster center to @xmath207 g at @xmath1 1.3 mpc radius , with a trend similar to that of the thermal gas .",
    "the magnetic field profiles in a665@xcite and a2163@xcite show a flatter decline , probably because the ongoing violent mergers in these clusters are playing a significant role in determining the conditions of the radiating particles and of the magnetic field .",
    "important clues on the magnetic field distribution are also derived from mhd cosmological simulations .",
    "dolag et al.@xcite simulated the formation of magnetized galaxy clusters from an initial density perturbation field , using a cosmological mhd code .",
    "they found that the @xmath0 g level field presently observed in clusters can be reproduced by the evolution of the magnetic field starting from an initial field of @xmath208 g at redshift 15 .",
    "this field is amplified by compression during the cluster collapse .",
    "they obtained that the process of large - scale structure formation in the universe drives the characteristics of these magnetic fields .",
    "one of their results is that the magnetic field strength at any point within galaxy clusters is proportional to the gas density .    in the simple case of adiabatic compression during a spherical collapse due to gravity ,",
    "the field lines are frozen into the plasma , and compression of the plasma results in compression of flux lines .",
    "the expected growth of the magnetic field is roughly proportional to the gas density as b @xmath209 , as a consequence of magnetic flux conservation .    from the simulations ,",
    "dolag et al.@xcite predict the existence of a correlation between the faraday rotation measure and the x - ray flux .",
    "they find that @xmath168 increases with the x - ray flux : @xmath210 with @xmath211 .",
    "the x - ray surface brightness is : @xmath212 the rm dispersion , obtained from eq .",
    "[ sigmarndwalk ] , is related to @xmath213 and @xmath200 .",
    "the two observables @xmath168 and s@xmath214 relate the two line of sight integrals with each other , therefore in comparing these two quantities , we actually compare cluster magnetic field versus thermal density .",
    "thus the magnetic field profile can be represented by :    @xmath215    in the case of the @xmath162-model ( eq . [ king ] ) , the x - ray flux @xmath216 is : @xmath217 by substituting eq .",

    ", it is derived that cluster magnetic field strengths obtained from rm arguments ( sec .",
    "6 ) are about an order of magnitude higher than the estimates obtained from both the diffuse synchrotron radio halo emission under equipartition conditions ( sec .",
    "4.1 ) and the inverse compton hard x - ray emission ( sec . 5 ) .",
    "relatively high magnetic fields could be present in regions of radio relics at the cluster periphery ( sec .",
    "4.2 ) , and in cold fronts ( sec . 7 ) . however , it is important to note that magnetic field estimates derived in relics and in cold fronts may be not representative of the overall cluster magnetic field strengths because they have been likely enhanced by compression .",
    "the clusters coma and a3667@xcite are unique in that they allow the field to be estimated by using different techniques",
    ". examples of the variation of magnetic field strength estimates from various methods and in various locations of these clusters are given in table 3 .",
    "several arguments can be invoked to alleviate the discrepancies between different methods of analysis .",
    "first , we remind that the equipartition values rely on several assumptions ( sec .",
    "moreover , the radio synchrotron and ic emissions originate from large cluster volumes , and the corresponding magnetic field estimates are averaged over the whole cluster , whereas the rm gives an average of the field along the line of sight , weighted by the thermal gas distribution . taking into account the radial profile of the cluster magnetic field and of the gas density , goldshmidt and rephaeli@xcite first showed that the field strength estimated with the ic method is expected to be smaller than that measured with the rm observations .",
    "beck et al.@xcite pointed out that field estimates derived from rm may be too large in the case of a turbulent medium where small - scale fluctuations in the magnetic field and the electron density are highly correlated .",
    "finally , more realistic electron spectra should be considered in the analysis of synchrotron and ic emission .",
    "it has been shown that ic models which include both the expected radial profile of the magnetic field , and anisotropies in the pitch angle distribution for the electrons allow higher values of the icm magnetic field in better agreement with the faraday rotation measurements@xcite . moreover , as shown in table 3 , the magnetic field strength may vary depending on the dynamical history and the location within the cluster .    in some cases",
    "a radio source could compress the gas and fields in the icm to produce local rm enhancements@xcite ( see also sec .",
    "6 ) , thus leading to overestimates of the derived icm magnetic field strength .",
    "the magnetic field may show complex structure , as filaments and/or substructure with a range of coherence scales , therefore the interpretation of rm data as given in sec .",
    "3.5.2 would be too simplified .",
    "indeed , newman et al.@xcite demonstrated that the assumption of a single - scale magnetic field leads to an overestimation of the magnetic field strength calculated through rm studies . in the next section",
    "we show that the use of a numerical approach can significantly improve our interpretation of the data and thus the knowledge of the strength and structure of magnetic fields .",
    "we have seen that cluster magnetic field strengths can be calculated through their effects on the polarization properties of radio galaxies by using an analytical formulation ( sec .",
    "3.5.2 ) based on the approximation that the magnetic field is tangled on a single scale .",
    "however , detailed observations of radio sources and mhd simulations@xcite suggest that it is necessary to consider more realistic cluster magnetic fields which fluctuate over a wide range of spatial scales . to accomplish this , murgia et al.@xcite simulated random three - dimensional magnetic fields with a power - law power spectrum : @xmath228 , where @xmath229 represents the wave number of the fluctuation scale .",
    "they investigated the effects of the expected faraday rotation on the polarization properties of radio galaxies and radio halos , by analyzing the rotation measure effects produced by a magnetic field with a power spectrum which extends over a large range of spatial scales ( @xmath230 kpc ) and with different values of the spectral index @xmath231 .",
    "[ fig10 ] ( top ) shows the simulated rm images obtained with different values of the index @xmath232 for a typical cluster of galaxies ( see caption for more details ) .",
    "different power spectrum indexes will generate different magnetic field configurations and therefore will give rise to very different simulated rm images . fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ( bottom ) shows the simulated profiles of , , and /   ( left , central and right panels , respectively ) , as a function of the projected distance from the cluster center . while both   and   increase linearly with the cluster magnetic field strength , the ratio /   depends only on the magnetic field power spectrum slope , for a given range of fluctuation scales .",
    "therefore the comparison between rm data of radio galaxies embedded in a cluster of galaxies and the simulated profiles , allows the inference of both the strength and the power spectrum slope of the cluster magnetic field .",
    "typical measured values of /   for cluster radio galaxies are derived to be in the range 0.2 - 1.2 , once the galaxy contribution is subtracted@xcite .",
    "thus the comparison of the observations with the simulations leads to a rather flat cluster magnetic field power spectrum , with a spectral index @xmath233 .",
    "this indicates that most of the magnetic energy density is on the smaller scales .",
    "another result of the simulations is that , when a power spectrum of the magnetic field is assumed , the inferred magnetic field strength is about a factor of 2 lower than the value computed from eq .",
    "[ felten ] if the single scale @xmath160 is taken to be equal to the smallest patchy structures detectable in the rm images , as frequently used .",
    "this implies that the magnetic fields derived from rm measurements may be overestimated ( see sec .",
    "different values of the power spectrum spectral index will generate very different total intensity and polarization brightness distributions for the radio emission of a halo .",
    "so far , polarization emission from radio halos has not been detected .",
    "the current upper limits to the polarization at 1.4 ghz are a few percent ( @xmath234% ) .",
    "murgia et al.@xcite simulated the expected halo total intensity and polarization brightness distributions at 1.4 ghz and 327 mhz , as they would appear when observed with a beam of 45 , by introducing in the 3-dimensional magnetic field an isotropic population of relativistic electrons .",
    "different values of the magnetic field strength and power spectrum index were assumed .",
    "[ fig11 ] ( top ) shows simulated radio halo brightness and polarization percentage distributions at 1.4 ghz ( see caption for more details ) .",
    "[ fig11 ] ( bottom ) shows the expected fractional polarization profiles at 1.4 ghz and 327 mhz for the different values of the average magnetic field strength and power spectrum spectral index .",
    "simulations indicate that a power spectrum slope steeper than @xmath235 and a magnetic field strength lower than @xmath236 g result in a radio halo polarization percentage at 1.4 ghz far in excess of the current observational upper limits .",
    "this means that , in agreement with the rm simulations , either the power spectrum spectral index is flatter than @xmath235 or the magnetic field strength is significantly higher than @xmath236 g .",
    "the halo depolarization at 327 mhz is particularly severe and the expected polarization percentage at this frequency is always below 1% .",
    "moreover it is also evident that the magnetic field power spectrum slope has a significant effect in shaping the radio halo .",
    "in particular , flat power spectrum indexes ( @xmath237 ) give raise to very smooth radio brightness images ( under the assumption that the radiating electrons are uniformly distributed ) .",
    "the origin of the magnetic fields observed in galaxies and clusters of galaxies is debated .",
    "very little is known about their existence before and after the time of recombination , their evolution , and the possible impact they could have on galaxy and structure formation .",
    "we very briefly give the outlines of the main scenarios proposed for the magnetic fields in the icm , without going into the details , which can be found in the literature@xcite .    according to the first scenario ,",
    "cluster magnetic fields may be _ primordial _ , i.e. generated in the early universe prior to recombination@xcite . in this case , magnetic fields would be already present at the onset of structure formation , and would be a remnant of the early universe .",
    "one mechanism for the generation of primordial fields involves the `` biermann battery '' effect@xcite , which occurs when the gradients of electron pressure and number density are not parallel , thus electrostatic equilibrium is no longer possible .",
    "this leads to a thermoelectric current which generates an electric field ( and a corresponding magnetic field ) that restores force balance .",
    "other possibilities might be that weak seed fields were formed in the phase transitions of the early universe , such as a quark - hadron ( qcd ) , or electroweak ( ew ) transition , where local charge separation occurs creating local currents , or during inflation , where electromagnetic quantum fluctuations are amplified@xcite .",
    "values of these seed fields are of the order of @xmath1 10@xmath238 g.    in principle , the presence of magnetic fields in the very early universe might be detectable through their effect on the big bang nucleosynthesis , or if the expansion is observed to be anisotropic .",
    "current observations of anisotropy in the cmb place weak upper limits ( b @xmath239 5 @xmath175 10@xmath191 g ) on the strength of a homogeneous component of a primordial magnetic field generated in this way@xcite . by analyzing the effect of the inhomogeneities in the matter distribution of the universe on the faraday rotation of distant qsos , limits of b @xmath239 @xmath240 g",
    "are obtained@xcite , depending on the assumed scales of the fluctuations .",
    "another scenario is that the cosmological magnetic fields are generated in later epochs of the universe .",
    "gnedin et al.@xcite argued that the strongest `` biermann battery '' effects are likely to be associated with the epoch of cosmological reionization .",
    "kulsrud et al.@xcite investigated the possibility that the field may be _ protogalactic _ , i.e. generated during the initial stages of the structure formation process , during the protogalaxy formation .",
    "a third scenario involves the _",
    "origin , i.e. ejection from galactic winds of normal galaxies or from active and starburst galaxies@xcite .",
    "galaxy outflows , gas stripping , ejection from the agn by radio jets , all contribute to deposit magnetic fields into the icm .",
    "galactic fields may be arise from the fields in the earliest stars , then ejected into the interstellar medium by stellar outflows and supernova explosions .",
    "alternatively , fields in galaxies may result directly from a primordial field that is adiabatically compressed when the protogalactic cloud collapses .",
    "indeed , battery mechanism on galactic scales can generate fields up to 10@xmath241 g.    support for a galactic injection in the icm comes from the evidence that a large fraction of the icm is of galactic origin , since it contains a significant concentration of metals .",
    "however , fields in clusters have strengths and coherence size comparable to , and in some cases larger than , galactic fields@xcite . therefore , it seems quite difficult that the magnetic fields in the icm derive from ejection of the galactic fields .",
    "the recent observations of strong magnetic fields in galaxy clusters suggest that the origin of these fields may indeed be primordial .",
    "the observed field strengths greatly exceed the amplitude of the seed fields , or of fields injected by some mechanism .",
    "therefore , magnetic field amplification seems unavoidable .",
    "dynamo effect can be at work .",
    "a magnetic dynamo consists of electrically conducting matter moving in a magnetic field in such a way that the induced currents maintain and amplify the original field@xcite .",
    "the essential features of the galactic dynamo model are turbulent motions in the interstellar medium , driven by stellar winds , supernova explosions , and hydromagnetic instabilities .",
    "in addition , amplification can occur during the cluster collapse . during the hierarchical cluster formation process",
    ", mergers generate shocks , bulk flows and turbulence within the icm .",
    "the first two of these processes can result in some field amplification simply through compression .",
    "however , it is the turbulence which is the most promising source of non - linear amplification .",
    "mhd calculations have been performed@xcite to investigate the origin , distribution , strength and evolution of the magnetic fields .",
    "the results of these simulations show that cluster mergers can dramatically alter the local strength and structure of cluster - wide magnetic fields , with a strong amplification of the magnetic field intensity .",
    "the initial field distribution at the beginning of the simulations at high redshift is irrelevant for the final structure of the magnetic field .",
    "the final structure is dominated only by the cluster collapse .",
    "fields can be amplified from values of @xmath1 10@xmath191 g to @xmath1 10@xmath169 g.    roettiger et al.@xcite found a significant evolution ( see fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] ) of the structure and strength of the magnetic fields during two distinct epochs of the merger evolution . in the first",
    ", the field becomes quite filamentary as a result of stretching and compression caused by shocks and bulk flows during infall , but only minimal amplification occurs . in the second",
    ", amplification of the field occurs more rapidly , particularly in localized regions , as the bulk flow is replaced by turbulent motions .",
    "shear flows are extremely important for the amplification of the magnetic field , while the compression of the gas is of minor importance .",
    "mergers change the local magnetic field strength drastically .",
    "but also the structure of the cluster - wide field is influenced . at early stages of the merger",
    "the filamentary structures prevail .",
    "this structure breaks down later ( @xmath1 23 gyr ) and leaves a stochastically ordered magnetic field .",
    "our knowledge of the magnetic field properties in galaxy clusters has significantly improved in recent years , owing to the improved capabilities of radio and x - ray telescopes .",
    "it is well established that @xmath0 g level magnetic fields are widespread in the icm , regardless of the presence of large - scale diffuse radio emission .",
    "the magnetic field strengths show almost an order of magnitude scatter between clusters , or within a given cluster , and are extreme in cluster cooling cores . for such large fields the magnetic pressure is comparable to or larger than the gas pressure derived from x - ray data , suggesting that magnetic fields may play a significant role in the cluster dynamics .    the observations are often interpreted in terms of the simplest possible model , i.e. a constant field throughout the whole cluster . however , a decline with radius is expected if the intensity of the magnetic field results from the compression of the thermal plasma during the cluster gravitational collapse .",
    "observational evidence of magnetic field profiles has been derived in some clusters .",
    "moreover the magnetic field could show complex structure with a range of coherence scales .",
    "the study of cluster magnetic fields has gained a big interest in recent years , leading to several new observations as well as simulations .",
    "there are , however , still many questions to answer : are the fields filamentary , what are the coherence scales , to what extent do the thermal and non - thermal plasmas mix in cluster atmospheres , how do the fields extend , what is the radial trend of the field strength , how does the field strength depend on cluster parameters such as the gas temperature , metallicity , mass , substructure and density profile , how do the fields evolve with cosmic time , and finally how were the fields generated ?    new generation instruments in the radio band , as the evla , lofar and ska , are rather promising and will establish a clear connection between radio astronomical techniques and the improvement in the knowledge of the x - ray sky .",
    "there are various satellite missions , as _ astro - e2 _ , _ xeus _ and _ constellation x _ , which will map the x - ray sky at low and high energies in the next years",
    ". these will provide a more precise knowledge of the x - ray surface brightness of clusters , i.e. of their thermal gas density , allowing a more accurate and correct interpretation of the sensitive rm measurements .",
    "the detection of hxr non - thermal emission will provide independent measurements of the magnetic fields .",
    "the accurate experimental determination of large - scale magnetic fields in the intracluster medium will thus be possible .",
    "the detection of synchrotron radiation at the lowest possible levels will allow the measurement of magnetic fields in even more rarefied regions of the intergalactic space , and the investigation of the relation between the formation of magnetic fields and the formation of the large - scale structure in the universe .",
