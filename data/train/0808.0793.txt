    "numerical models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) have demonstrated that large - scale stellar bars are especially efficient in moving gas into the central kpc .",
    "however , no clear picture is yet available for the gas flow inside a few 100 pc from the nucleus @xcite .    arguably the simplest galaxies to observationally test these models are the latest - type spirals , because they have bulge - less disks .",
    "however , even these objects have rather complex central star formation histories .",
    "about 75% of late - type disks host distinct nuclear star clusters @xcite , most of which have experienced multiple discrete star formation events in their history @xcite .",
    "so far , it is unclear whether the repetitive star formation in these nuclear clusters is due to variability of the gravitational potential ( e.g. dissolution / formation of a stellar bar ) , the clumpy nature of the molecular gas ( e.g. inflow of discrete giant molecular complexes ",
    "gmcs ) , or whether nuclear massive star formation itself is disrupting the gas supply .",
    "the scd spiral is one of the nearest examples of a late - type spiral harboring a well - studied nuclear star cluster .",

    "previous studies of the molecular gas in ic342 , with single dish and interferometric millimeter instruments @xcite , lack sufficient spatial resolution ( 5872  pc ) to resolve the structure of the gmcs , thus hampering accurate comparisons with the nuclear star formation .",
    "the spiral geometry of the molecular gas in the central 500pc is due to the response of the gas to the large - scale stellar bar @xcite .",
    "a comprehensive study @xcite of the molecular chemistry in ic342 has demonstrated that the molecular gas in the central few hundred pc is subject to a number of different excitation mechanisms .",
    "recent ovro observations of the @xmath2co(2 - 1 ) line showed evidence for molecular gas being associated with the nuclear star cluster itself @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2co(2 - 1 ) and hcn(1 - 0 ) lines tracing the total and dense molecular gas content were observed with the iram plateau de bure interferometer ( pdbi ) in 2005 january / february and 2004 january , respectively . for calibration and mapping",
    ", we used the standard iram gildas software packages clic and mapping @xcite .",
    "the observations resulted in data cubes of @xmath3 and @xmath4 resolution with an rms of 10 and 3.6 mjy / beam for the co(2 - 1 ) and hcn(1 - 0 ) line .",
    "intensity maps were derived using a 3@xmath5 cut for line emission present over at least two channel of 3.0 ( 6.0 ) km / s width .    for a direct comparison of the ( dense ) molecular gas to the stellar light and the ionized gas ( as observed with hst ) , the hst data need to have an absolute astrometry of better than at least 0.5  . to achieve this , we first aligned a newly obtained hst pa@xmath6 image ( pi calzetti , pid 11080 ) to a deep 6 cm continuum vla image ( pi schinnerer ) as both exhibit a very similar geometry at comparable angular resolution ( 0.4  vs. 0.75  ) .",
    "archival hst f656n and f606w images ( pid 8581 , 5446 ) were then aligned to the pa@xmath6 map using a number of stellar clusters . to obtain the continuum - subtracted h@xmath6 map",
    ", we subtracted a scaled version of the f606w image from f656n .",
    "no astrometric corrections are required for radio interferometric data as the observations provide an absolute astrometric reference frame .",
    "this resulted in very well aligned optical / nir and radio images , solving the ambiguities that plagued our previous study which relied on the geometry of the dust lanes @xcite .",
    "in the new co(2 - 1 ) and hcn(1 - 0 ) maps ( fig . [",
    "fig : sum ] ) , the eastern spiral arm exhibits a prominent break at @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( j2000 ) , about 4  east and 1  south of the galaxy center . at this break the eastern spiral arm stops continuing inward and stays at a roughly constant distance from the nucleus whereas the western spiral arm reaches close ( within 1  ) to the nucleus itself .",
    "the nuclear co(2 - 1 ) gas clump identified earlier @xcite is now resolved into a faint , narrow gas lane running east - west just north of the nucleus .",
    "in addition , the southern portion of the eastern spiral arm exhibits a sharp edge on the side facing the nucleus .",
    "the geometry of the hcn emission closely resembles that of the co(2 - 1 ) , except for the western spiral arm which extends further towards the nucleus in hcn while the emission north of it is too diffuse to be detected in hcn .",
    "the central cavity in the molecular gas distribution is displaced from the nucleus to the southeast and offers a relatively unobscured view onto the stellar disk , as demonstrated by the comparison to the optical continuum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sum ] ) : the stellar disk is substantially fainter wherever molecular gas is present . both co(2 - 1 ) and hcn emission trace very well the prominent dust lanes in the central 250pc .",
    "this dramatic change in extinction causes an elongation of the isophotes even at nir wavelengths , which might be misinterpreted as a small - scale bar",
    ". a comparison of the co(2 - 1 ) and h@xmath6 distribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ha ] ) shows that the ionized gas fills the central cavity of the molecular gas .",
    "in particular , the h@xmath6 shells ( or arcs ) delineating the southeast edge of the cavity suggest an ionized outflow that coincides with the inner edge of the southeastern co(2 - 1 ) spiral arm .",
    "due to ic342 s almost face - on orientation , the gas motions are difficult to interpret , as we start to observe a blend of several smaller molecular clouds plus streaming motions due to the stellar bar and a mix of the diffuse and dense gas component in the co(2 - 1 ) emission .      while the overall molecular gas distribution in the center of ic342 is governed by the gravitational influence of a large - scale stellar bar @xcite ( also as evidenced by the presence of shocks seen in ch@xmath9oh and sio ,",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the asymmetries in the molecular gas properties within the inner 50 pc can be explained by the impact of nuclear star formation onto this gas flow .",
    "the comparison of the molecular gas distribution to the h@xmath6 image suggests that the expanding ionized gas is running into the molecular gas , particularly in the southeastern portion of the spiral arm ( hereafter : segment ) . as we will show in  [ sec : feed ] , the displacement of this arm segment is in agreement with mechanical energy input into the total and dense molecular gas , leading to it being compressed and pushed out , or at least halted by the pressure of the ionized gas .",
    "@xcite have shown that this part of the spiral ( gmc  a ) is the one most excited by uv photons and more diffuse than the rest of the dense gmcs .",
    "radiative excitation by the nucleus can be excluded as it is not an agn or a uv source @xcite .",
    "the discontinuity in the eastern spiral arm as well as the different chemical properties of this arm segment argue against a simple offset of the gas spiral from the dynamical center .",
    "taken together , this suggests an impact from stellar winds and supernova explosions on the morphology of circumnuclear molecular gas as well as altering its chemical composition .    some evidence for a corresponding discontinuity along the northern portion of the western arm ( thin dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] ) is observed in co(21 ) .",
    "however the weak h@xmath6 emission , the lack of an altered chemistry and the hcn morphology makes the case for direct impact of stellar winds and sne less clear here .",
    "the exact reasons for the asymmetry manifested by the outflow from the nuclear starburst ( as seen in the h@xmath6 line ) are unclear , but a such behavior is not unusual for large - scale outflows from central star formation ( e.g. m82 ; * ? ? ?",
    "potentially the northern portion of the western spiral arm might lack these signs because it is composed of more dispersed molecular material .",
    "in addition , the higher extinction on the near - side ( western side ) of the galaxy can cause some differences as well .",
    "although the dynamical timescale in the nuclear region is very small ( @xmath10 10myr ) , the spiral pattern itself is rotating slower . as nuclear spirals can easily be excited by large - scale bars ( e.g. ,",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we can use the pattern speed of the stellar bar of @xmath11 = 0.4 km / s/  @xcite . at a radius of 3.3  ( 50pc )",
    "this corresponds to a velocity of 8km / s , thus one revolution of the spiral pattern itself takes about 40myr . for a 10 myr old",
    "starburst the spiral has moved by a quarter .",
    "this is consistent with the arm segment which covers about a quarter of a circle and also the age for the most recent star formation event in the nuclear cluster .",
    "to summarize , the ionizing outflow produced by stellar winds and supernovae from the recent nuclear star forming event appears to have changed the location of the southern part of the eastern spiral arm , while the western spiral arm appears less effected .",
    "if the gas flow along the western arm is less disturbed by the nuclear bubble , this may explain why the youngest star formation episode is also asymmetrically stronger towards the western arm ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we now investigate whether the timescale and required energy are indeed compatible with the scenario outlined above .",
    "the dislocation is either due to an actual movement of individual molecular clouds against the gravitational potential or the ionized gas is acting as a barrier altering the orbits of the molecular gas . in both scenarios , some kind of force",
    "is required to counterbalance the gravitational potential , thus the following estimates should be valid in either case .",
    "the deprojected distance from the nuclear cluster to the h@xmath6 rim is about 3.3 \" or 50pc .",
    "a shell with a typical expansion velocity of 20 - 40 km / s @xcite can travel this distance in about ( 2.4 - 1.2 ) myr , which is less than the age of the last nuclear star formation episode ( 4 - 30 myr ) . to first order",
    ", it is therefore possible that the h@xmath6 shells were produced in this event .",
    "assuming that the southeastern arm segment has been ` pushed ' to a larger radius , we can derive a rough estimate for the required cumulative energy using the mass of the molecular gas and reasonable assumptions about the gravitational potential .",
    "we assume a virial gas mass of @xmath12 for the southeastern segment @xcite . to estimate the kinetic and potential energy required",
    ", we use the rotation curve of @xcite after correcting for the new distance to estimate velocities of v(r@xmath13=50pc)@xmath025 km / s and v(r@xmath14=22pc)@xmath012 km / s .",
    "a total energy of @xmath15/2\\cong 2.2\\times10^{52 } erg$ ] is required to move the molecular gas mass from a radius of 18pc ( the location of the unaffected western spiral arm ) to 50pc , the current distance of the southeastern segment ( inclination effects are neglected given the low inclination of @xmath16 , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "a cluster with a stellar mass of @xmath17 releases a mechanical luminosity of @xmath18 at an age of 4 - 30 myr ( assuming an instantaneous burst with solar metallicity ; see starburst99 models , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . since the flux - calibrated continuum - subtracted hst pa@xmath6 image suffers less dust extinction than the h@xmath6 image ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ha ] ) , we use the former for a consistency check .",
    "the pa@xmath6 line flux of the ionized gas bubble ( @xmath19 ) can be converted into a h@xmath6 luminosity of @xmath20 using a h@xmath6/pa@xmath6 ratio of 7.82 appropriate for a metal - rich region ( without extinction correction ) . assuming that about 3% of the mechanical energy is converted into h@xmath6 luminosity @xcite and a filling factor of about 0.5 for the bubble ( from the flux present inside the bubble ) , this translates into a mechanical luminosity of about @xmath21 .",
    "this is consistent with the above value derived from the cluster mass and age .",
    "thus over the course of the derived travel time of 2 myrs a total mechanical energy of @xmath22 will be produced .",
    "however , this mechanical energy is distributed over the entire sphere and subject to radiative losses . assuming a filling factor of only 3% for gmc - a and radiative losses of 90% , plus taking into account that likely only a fraction of 20% of the nuclear stellar mass",
    "was produced in the last event , an energy of @xmath23 is expected to be available for mechanical interaction .",
    "even this rather conservative estimate for the available mechanical energy is sufficient to explain the gas morphology .",
    "we conclude that , based on time and energetic arguments , mechanical feedback from nuclear star formation is a plausible explanation for the observed molecular gas distribution .",
    "the following picture for the gas flow in ic342 emerges ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] ) : the large - scale stellar bar moves gas toward the center via two gas spiral arms .",
    "the stellar winds and supernova shocks released by the most recent nuclear star formation event have significantly altered the path of the molecular gas towards the center on the last few 10pc , thus currently preventing efficient fueling of the nucleus .",
    "this is the first time strong evidence has been found for mechanical feedback of nuclear star formation onto the ( disk ) gas _ flow _ in an extragalactic nucleus . as the large - scale stellar bar continues to move gas towards the center , it is likely that the gas resumes its old path once the mechanical energy has been dispersed .",
    "presumably , the nucleus will then again collect molecular gas until the next star formation episode .",
    "this feedback between nuclear activity and fueling efficiency appears to self - regulate the rate of nuclear star formation and offers a natural explanation for the repetitive star formation found in nuclear star clusters @xcite .",
    "if correct , this scenario implies that models for the gas fueling mechanism ( over the innermost 1 - 100pc ) can not rely on the shape of the gravitational potential alone but need to take the effect of mechanical energy released by nuclear activity onto the gas flow into account",
    ". the impact of this feedback process will be strongly variable in time and will critically depend on the amount of energy released as well as its geometry .",
    "although mechanical feedback has long been suspected to be important for galactic nuclei , so far no observations have existed to directly support this . in a broader sense , these results also have implications for the evolution of any central massive object ( be it a stellar cluster or a black hole ) that requires occasional fueling .",
    "nuclear activity appears to have the potential to significantly reduce or even ( temporarily ) shut off fueling , thus self - regulating the growth of the central mass .",
