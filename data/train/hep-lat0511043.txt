    "the gluon propagator is a fundamental green s function of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "certainly , a good description of this two point function is required to understand the non - perturbative regime of the theory . moreover , in the landau gauge , the gluon and the ghost propagators at zero momentum are connected with possible confinement mechanisms . in particular , the kugo - ojima confinement mechanism requires an infinite zero momentum ghost propagator @xcite and the zwanziger horizon condition @xcite implies either reflection positivity violation or a null zero momentum gluon propagator . from this last condition it can be proved that the zero momentum ghost propagator should diverge @xcite .",
    "the computation of the gluon and ghost propagators for the full range of momenta can not be done in perturbation theory . presently , we have to rely either on dyson - schwinger equations ( dse ) or on the lattice formulation of qcd ; both are first principles approaches . in the first technique a truncation of an infinite tower of equations , together with the parametrizations of a number of vertices , namely the three gluon and the gluon - ghost vertices , is required to solve the equations . in the second , one has to care about finite volume and finite lattice spacing effects .",

    ", the solution reads @xmath6 the dse equations allow a determination of the exponent @xmath7 , which , for the zero momentum , implies a null ( infinite ) gluon ( ghost ) propagator , in agreement with the criteria described above , and a finite strong coupling constant defined from the gluon and ghost dressing functions @xcite .",
    "renormalization group analysis based on the flow equation @xcite were able to predict , for the solution ( [ zdse ] ) , the range of possible values for the exponent .",
    "the results of this analysis being @xmath8 , implying , again , a null ( infinite ) zero momentum gluon ( ghost ) propagator .",
    "a similar analysis of the dse but using time - independent stochastic quantisation @xcite predicted the same behaviour and @xmath9 .    the reader should be aware that not all solutions of the dse predict a vanishing zero momentum gluon propagator . in @xcite , the authors computed a solution of the dse with a finite zero momentum gluon propagator .",
    "moreover , in @xcite it was claimed that the gluon and ghost propagators in the deep infrared region are not connected via the same exponent @xmath1 and that there is nt yet a clear theoretical answer concerning the value of zero momentum gluon propagator . according to the authors , the range of possible values goes from zero to infinity .    on the lattice , there are a number of studies concerned with the gluon propagator @xcite . on large lattices ,",
    "the propagator was investigated in @xcite .",
    "although the lattices used had a limited access to the deep infrared region , the authors conclude in favour of a finite zero momentum gluon propagator , which would imply @xmath10 for the solution ( [ zdse ] ) . in @xcite , the infinite volume and continuum limits of the landau gauge gluon propagator were investigated using various lattices and , again , the data supported a finite zero momentum gluon propagator . in @xcite , the three - dimensional lattice su(2 )",

    "moreover , in the preliminary finite volume study @xcite of the two point gluon function it came out that @xmath1 increases with the lattice volume and , in that sense , previously computed values should be regarded as lower bounds .",
    "the previous studies do not provide a clear answer about the zero momentum gluon propagator . in this paper",
    ", we update the results of our previous publications for the infrared region , using a larger set of lattices , that allows a better control of the infinite volume extrapolation . two different extrapolations to the infinite volume are performed , namely the extrapolation of @xmath1 and the extrapolation of the propagator , giving essentially the same result . the main conclusions from this investigation being that the lattice data is compatible with the dse solution ( [ zdse ] ) for the infrared gluon dressing function , for momenta @xmath13 mev or lower , and that the infinite volume extrapolation of the lattice gluon propagator seems to favour a vanishing zero momentum gluon propagator .",

    "the value quoted in @xcite is in between the above figures , with the result from the so called set iii being almost compatible within one standard deviation with @xmath73 gev@xmath74 and the result from set ii being compatible only at three standard deviations .",
    "the extrapolated propagators can be seen in figure [ dext ] ; the errors were computed assuming gaussian error propagation . for infrared momenta , the extrapolated propagators interpolate between the two lattices simulated in @xcite . moreover , for zero momentum the extrapolated propagators are smaller than the propagator of leinweber _ et al _ computed with their largest lattice .",
    "the extrapolated propagators from fitting the two different sets of lattices are compatible , at least , at the level of two standard deviations .",
    "the propagator computed from set iii shows much larger statistical errors .",
    "the differences between the two propagators are larger for smaller momenta .",
    "this difference can be used to estimate systematic errors .",
    "the fit of the dressing function computed from the extrapolated propagator , obtained from set ii , to the first three nonzero momenta to the pure power law gives @xmath78 and has a @xmath79 .",

    ", the data shows finite volume effects , with @xmath1 becoming larger for larger volumes . in this sense , all values in table [ kappa ] can be read as lower bounds on the infinite volume figure .",
    "the infinite volume @xmath1 was estimated in two different ways : i ) from an extrapolation of the values reported in table [ kappa ] , assuming a linear and a quadratic dependence on the inverse volume ; ii ) extrapolating the propagator , assuming a quadratic dependence on @xmath87 .",
    "the results of the first method are ( [ kinfty ] ) , ( [ kinfty2 ] ) , giving an weighted mean value of @xmath88 .",
    "the value for the exponent from extrapolating directly the gluon propagator being @xmath78 , if one considers the five largest lattices ( set ii ) , and @xmath81 , if one considers the four largest lattices ( set iii ) .",
    "the first value is on the top of the value obtained from extrapolating directly @xmath1 as function of the volume .",
    "moreover , these two values agree well with the time - independent stochastic quantisation prediction @xmath9 @xcite and are within the range of possible values estimated with renormalization group arguments @xcite , @xmath8 . all these results point towards a vanishing zero momentum gluon propagator .",
    "the @xmath81 , obtained from fitting the gluon dressing function , computed from the quadratic extrapolation of the gluon propagator to the infinite volume , using only the four largest lattices ( set iii ) , is compatible with both an infinite and a null zero momentum gluon propagator .",
    "this value is smaller than the measured exponent from our largest lattice , @xmath89 , and , although , these two numbers being compatible within errors , the extrapolated @xmath1 does not follow the observed behaviour that @xmath1 increases with the lattice volume .",
    "this is probably due to the large statistical errors observed in the extrapolation using the smaller set of lattices .",
    "finally , one can claim a @xmath2 with the lattice data favouring the right hand side of the interval .",
    "although the lattice data seems to favour a null zero momentum gluon propagator , the measured extrapolated zero momentum propagator clearly does not vanish - see equation ( [ dr0 ] ) . as a function of the lattice volume ,",
    "the bare zero momentum propagator becomes smaller for larger volumes .",
    "moreover , in @xcite it was shown that the extrapolation of the zero momentum propagator , depending on the functional form considered , is compatible with both a vanishing and a nonvanishing value . in this study",
    "we avoided the question of the zero momentum value by fitting only the smallest nonzero momenta .",
    "solutions to this puzzle require simulations on larger lattices and/or having a better theoretical control on the volume extrapolation .",
    "currently , we are engaged in improving the statistics for our larger lattices and simulating bigger volumes , aiming to improve the infinite volume extrapolations .",
