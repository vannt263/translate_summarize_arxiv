    "a long sought - after goal is the all - optical processing of information , replacing state - of - the - art electronic handling .",
    "it is well known , however , that major obstacles arise in particular at spatial scales small compared to the involved wavelengths .",
    "light can not be focused to arbitrarily small areas , and it can not directly be used to image or write structures below a scale given by the involved wavelength  @xcite . a key origin for these restrictions is diffraction , leading , e.g. , to the rayleigh limit for the case of imaging  @xcite . due to the enormous significance for applications ,",
    "e.g. , in nano- or life - sciences , a number of schemes have been invented to circumvent or even surpass the standard limits in a various setups .",
    "examples are sub - wavelength microscopy  @xcite , and optical sub - wavelength lithography  @xcite .",
    "but more fundamentally , diffraction also already impacts the propagation of a light beam in free space .",
    "for example , a gaussian probe beam with a certain width at the focal plane spreads as it propagates away from the focal plane , on a length scale given by the rayleigh length  @xcite .",
    "this paraxial diffraction spreading occurs in free space as well as inside a medium , and affects applications such as the transmission of small images , the transfer of small mask structures to the target surface in lithography , or the steering or optical manipulation of light beams .",
    "it was recognized that this spreading due to paraxial diffraction can be decreased , increased or completely eliminated by propagating the light beam through a medium with spatially varying optical properties .",
    "this can be achieved via the use of external coherent control fields , inducing a spatially varying susceptibility and inducing phase shifts via different physical processes  @xcite .",
    "the spatial profile of a strong control beam renders the medium inhomogeneous along the transverse direction . since absorption and dispersion of the medium are crucially dependent on the intensity and the shape of the strong control beam",
    ", the control beam will strongly affect the propagation of the probe beam . the ability to control the spatially varying susceptibility of the medium via external fields holds the key to eventually being able to control the spreading of optical beams . these and related techniques are of significance also because they have the potential of complementing optical information transmission with all - optical information processing , thereby replacing the currently ubiquitous electronic information processing .",

    "( a ) shows a schematic setup to study the propagation of a probe laser field through an atomic vapor cell .",
    "the propagation dynamics is controlled using an additional control laser field with a laguerre - gaussian transversal profile .",
    "( b ) three - level @xmath0 configuration of the vapor atoms.,width=226 ]    thus it is not surprising that a great number of schemes both in theory and in experiment demonstrated the ability to optically control the propagation of light .",
    "most of these works can be understood in analogy to a waveguide , confining the light in specific modes transversally .",
    "this could enable one to implement applications originally proposed for physical waveguides  @xcite with all - optically induced waveguides .",
    "for example , it was shown that spatial variations in a medium induced by a control laser field can lead to focusing or de - focusing of a probe beam  @xcite .",
    "an optically written waveguide realized by applying a laguerre - gaussian control field near - resonantly to an atomic medium to propagate a probe beam was demonstrated in  @xcite and discussed in  @xcite .",
    "waveguiding in a warm rubidium vapor based on an off - resonant raman configuration was reported in  @xcite .",
    "a signal beam was shown to propagate with small spot size over several diffraction lengths . in a variant of such setups ,",
    "the spatial profile of a control beam can be cast onto a probe beam .",
    "recently , this concept was implemented in rubidium atomic vapor , based on coherent population trapping  @xcite . in this experiment ,",
    "a spatial profile was transferred from the coupling beam onto the probe beam , which was found to exhibit feature sized five times smaller than the diffraction - limited size .",
    "however , all of these schemes suffer from the fact that the modes other than the specific supported mode can not propagate without diffraction , or even not at all .",
    "this prohibits the desired transmission of arbitrary images . in order to overcome this limitation , very recently",
    ", a scheme for the direct propagation of arbitrary probe beam images without diffraction was put forward theoretically  @xcite and verified experimentally  @xcite .",
    "this setup is based on an atomic three - level system reminiscent of electromagnetically induced transparency , but assumes an explicit breaking of the usual two - photon resonance condition such that strong absorption occurs .",
    "the underlying physics in this setup is fundamentally different from previous setups , as it relies on the movement of the atoms in order to compensate the diffraction , rather than on a stationary waveguide .",
    "a method to propagate optical images with reduced diffraction based on the saturated absorption mechanism in a two - level atom was proposed in  @xcite .",
    "future ideas along this line therefore can be expected to advance key applications in optical information transmission and processing , as well in reading and writing at the sub - wavelength scale .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss the light propagation through waveguides written by a spatially structured control laser field into a warm atomic vapor . the laguerre - gaussian control field and the probe laser field couple with the atoms to form a three - level system in @xmath0 configuration as shown in fig .",
    "we start by deriving analytical results for the steady state susceptibility experienced by the probe beam .",
    "we then consider a thermal medium by averaging the susceptibility over a maxwellian velocity distribution of the vapor atoms .",
    "the probe beam propagation dynamics is analyzed by numerically solving the maxwell - schrdinger equation including diffraction and dispersion in two spatial dimensions transversal to the propagation direction , the spatial profile of the control field , and the thermal motion of the vapor atoms .",
    "we find that for suitable parameter choices , a single gaussian probe field mode can be propagated diffraction - less or even with sub - diffraction through the warm vapor .",
    "we then proceed to analyze more complex mode structures of the probe beam , and show that a gaussian double pulse can be propagated without distortion or diffraction through the optically written waveguide .",
    "finally , we demonstrate that a beam formed out of multiple secant - hyperbolic shaped pulses can be propagated diffraction - less through the warm atomic vapor .",
    "the results on non - gaussian beam propagation open perspectives for the propagation of arbitrary images in warm atomic vapors .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "the figure compares the propagation of the probe beam through the medium in the presence and the absence of the control field . in free space or in the absence of the control beam , we observe from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] that the probe beam spreads to nearly 5.64@xmath72 during the propagation over a distance of 5  cm .",
    "the most intuitive way to understand the spreading of the beam is by decomposing it into a set of plane waves . in the course of the propagation",
    ", each plane wave acquires its own unique phase shift .",
    "the superposition of the phase shifted plane waves at the output gives rise to spreading .",
    "in contrast , for bessel , mathieu and airy beams each constituent plane wave acquires exactly the same phase shift . in these cases ,",
    "diffractionless propagation is possible through free space .",
    "analogously , the manipulation of diffraction - induced spreading is possible by changing the spatial dispersion of the medium .",
    "this spatial dispersion can be substantially modified by employing a suitable structure of the control field .",
    "in particular , a suitable structure of the control field can cancel or even reverse the effect of diffraction .",
    "our numerical results in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] obtained with the lg control field show that the width of the probe beam is 37@xmath56 m after a 5  cm propagation distance .",
    "thus , the width of the output probe beam in the presence of the lg control beam is narrower than the width of the input probe beam , demonstrating that the lg control field can be used to reverse and even over - compensate the effect of diffraction .",
    "these results are in good agreement with the experiment of howell et al  @xcite .",
    "we also notice from the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] that the integrated transmission intensity of the output probe beam is 44@xmath87 of the integrated intensity of the input probe beam .",
    "this indicates that the probe beam can be guided efficiently in an atomic vapor .",
    "next , we study the propagation of a beam with two gaussian modes , using the same method as for the single gaussian probe beam . figure  [ fig : fig5a ] shows the normalized intensity of both transmitted gaussian beams in the @xmath88 plane along the @xmath48 axis for a propagation length up to @xmath89  cm in the presence of the lg control field . in comparison , without the control beam or in free space the incident probe beam undergoes spreading due to its geometrical shape as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5b ] .",
    "it can be seen from fig  [ fig : fig5b ] that again , the spreading due to diffraction can be eliminated using the lg control beam .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5b ] shows the unnormalized transmission of the two gaussian beams in the @xmath88 plane .",
    "it is clear from the inset of the fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5b ] that the transmitted energy of probe beam gets reduced by @xmath90 while the width of the lg control beam is changed from @xmath91 m to @xmath92 m .",
    "we also notice that the spacing between two peaks of the output probe beam can be increased by decreasing the width of the lg control beam .",
    "this shift in the probe beam peak positions arises if the probe beam spectrum is located on the sides of the control field intensity pattern , rather than symmetrically around the control field intensity maximum .",
    "as an application , the finesse of the output probe beam can be controlled by changing the width of the lg control beam .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] shows the radial distribution of the output probe beams at @xmath93  cm , for a medium without and with the lg control beam , respectively . as in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5b ] it can be seen that in free space or without the control beam , the beam profiles are severely distorted .",
    "in contrast , with the lg control beam , the shape of the two gaussian beams is preserved .",
    "this shows that the spatial structure of the control field can be used to transmit more complicated structures over a large distance without much diffraction and attenuation .",
    "we proceed with a probe beam formed out of multiple secant - hyperbolically shaped patterns as an example for the transmission of a non - gaussian field mode .",
    "the probe beam is defined as @xmath94,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the total number , the center , and the widths of the peaks , respectively . for simplicity , in our calculation , we assume that the individual peaks have equal widths @xmath97 .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig7a ] shows the radial variation of probe beam intensity in the presence of the lg control beam at the exit plane of the vapor at @xmath93  cm . a corresponding comparison of the non - gaussian beam propagation through the medium with and without the control beam is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7b ] .",
    "it is important to note from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7b ] that the output beam retains sub - peaks of secant - hyperbolic profile as they were present in the input beam .",
    "thus the lg control beam allows to propagate gaussian as well as non - gausssian beams through the medium without diffraction .",
