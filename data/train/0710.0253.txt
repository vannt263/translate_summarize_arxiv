    "the notion of a quasi - symmetric function is a generalization of a symmetric function introduced by gessel @xcite .",
    "the ring of quasi - symmetric functions @xmath1 has many interesting features , for example , it is a hopf algebra whose dual is isomorphic to the ring of non - commutative symmetric functions introduced by gefand et al . @xcite . as in the case of symmetric functions ,",
    "@xmath1 and its dual have nice representation theoretic interpretations related to the representations of degenerate hecke algebras and quantum groups of type @xmath2 @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "krob and thibon showed that gessel s fundamental quasi - symmetric functions in @xmath3 variables , which form a basis of @xmath1 in @xmath3 variables , are the characters of the irreducible polynomial representations of the degenerate quantum group associated to @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , the action of the degenerate quantum group determines a quasi - crystal graph structure on the irreducible polynomial representation , which is a subgraph of the kashiwara s crystal graph of young tableaux ( see also @xcite for a general review on this topic ) .    the purpose of the present paper is to give a new representation theoretic interpretation of @xmath1 using the crystal base theory for contragredient lie superalgebras developed by benkart , kang , and kashiwara @xcite .",
    "this work was motivated by observing that unlike finite dimensional complex simple lie algebras and their crystals , two borel subalgebras of a general linear lie superalgebra @xmath5 are not necessarily conjugate to each other , and the corresponding @xmath5-crystal structures are different in general since they may have different systems of simple roots . among the borel conjugacy classes of @xmath0 , we study in detail a crystal structure when the simple roots associated to a borel subalgebra are all odd and hence isotropic , while the crystals associated to a standard borel subalgebra of @xmath5 with a single odd simple root is discussed explicitly in @xcite .",
    "then it turns out that the combinatorics of these non - standard crystals is remarkably simple and nice .",
    "our main result is that as a @xmath0-crystal associated to this non - standard borel conjugacy class , the connected components in the crystal of tensor powers of the natural representation are parameterized by compositions , and each of them can be realized as the set of ( super ) quasi - ribbon tableaux of a given composition shape ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . an insertion algorithm for these non - standard crystals can be derived in a standard way , and it is shown to be compatible with our crystal structure . hence , we obtain an explicit description of the knuth equivalence or crystal equivalence for this case . furthermore , we show that the set of stembridge s enriched @xmath6-partitions @xcite is naturally equipped with this non - standard crystal structure , and then apply its combinatorial properties to decomposition of crystals including tensor product decompositions . as a corollary , it follows immediately that the irreducible characters of these non - standard @xmath0-crystals are equal to the super analogue of fundamental quasi - symmetric functions , which are defined by a standard method of superization @xcite , and they form a ring isomorphic to @xmath1 under a suitable limit .    one may regard the notion of non - standard @xmath0-crystals as the counterpart of the krob and thibon s quasi - crystals , and hence as a quasi - analogue of standard @xmath0-crystals . in this sense , one can define a quasi - analogue of a standard @xmath5-crystal for arbitrary @xmath7 and @xmath3 by a crystal associated to its borel conjugacy class having a maximal number of odd isotropic simple roots .",
    "this enables us to explain the relation between symmetric functions and quasi - symmetric functions as a special case of branching rules between @xmath5-crystals associated to a standard and a non - standard borel conjugacy classes .",
    "we discuss a crystal structure associated to a borel conjugacy class having a maximal number of odd isotropic simple roots , and classify its connected components occurring in the crystal of tensor powers of the natural representation , which are parameterized by certain pairs of a partition and a composition .",
    "then we obtain an explicit branching decomposition of standard @xmath5-crystals into non - standard ones .",

    "we consider in general a crystal structure associated to a borel conjugacy class with a maximal number of odd isotropic simple roots . finally ,",
