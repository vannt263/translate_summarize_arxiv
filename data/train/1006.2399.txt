    "a wide variety of evidence points to the existence of nonbaryonic dark matter  @xcite .",
    "there are three ways of directly confirming this hypothesis : producing dark matter or its cousins in an accelerator @xcite , directly detecting dark matter particles impinging on the earth in underground detectors @xcite , and indirectly detecting dark matter by observing the products of an annihilation of two dark matter particles in space @xcite .",
    "the current excitement in the field stems from the coincidental maturity of all three of these techniques .",
    "the large hadron collider began operations in 2009 , a number of direct detection experiments have proven their ability to scale up to the one - ton level , and there are several experiments ( fermi gamma - ray satellite telescope  @xcite , atmospheric cerenkov telescopes  @xcite , pamela  @xcite , ice cube  @xcite ) poised to detect the indirect signal .    for gamma - ray experiments a key challenge is to extract the dark matter signal in the presence of emission from point sources , such as pulsars and agn , and diffuse sources such as cosmic rays .",
    "one way to discriminate photons produced by a given dark matter source from the above backgrounds is to measure the energy spectrum .",
    "photons generated by the annihilation of standard thermally - produced particle dark matter have a spectrum characteristic of quark production and hadronization@xcite , distinguishing them from the typical power law - like behavior of other sources  @xcite . a second discriminant is the angular distribution  @xcite . the angular distribution of photons produced in dark matter annihilations results from the variation of the dark matter density profile as a function of @xmath2 , the angle between the incoming direction and the line connecting us to the galactic center .",
    "by contrast , the extra - galactic background  @xcite is more or less isotropic , and the diffuse galactic background is predominantly confined to the galactic disk .",
    "recently , several groups  @xcite have explored the possibility of indirect detection in the milky way halo by adding another discriminant , the probability distribution function ( pdf ) . in their recent analysis lee",
    "@xcite have determined the pdf of photons produced by dark matter annihilations in dark matter substructure ( subhalos ) in our galaxy , and they have shown that this pdf is clearly distinct from a poisson distribution .",
    "in particular , for a given pixel observed by , e.g. , the fermi telescope , there is an unusually large probability ( unusual compared with poisson expectation for the same mean number of counts ) of observing multiple counts from the population of subhalos along the line - of - sight .    here",
    "we test the idea of using the pdf , together with a @xmath0cdm - based model for the scatter in subhalo properties , to extract the dark matter signal in the fermi experiment . in this work",
    "we are in particular interested in answering the following questions :    * can the pdf  if known  be used as an effective tool to extract the dark matter signal ?",
    "* will fermi have the statistical reach to probe a velocity - weighted annihilation cross section of @xmath3 @xmath4 sec@xmath5 , the canonical value for a thermally produced dark matter candidate ?",
    "* does one need to know the pdf in order to analyze an experiment ?",
    "i.e. , if one incorrectly assumes a @xmath6 distribution , will s / he be led to incorrect conclusions about the parameters under consideration ?    for concreteness , throughout , we make predictions and projections for one year of fermi data .    the layout of this paper is as follows . ",

    "our conclusions are presented in  [ sec : con ] .",
    "we assume a three - component model for the diffuse gamma - ray background : annihilation radiation from dark matter subhalos , galactic emission , and extra - galactic emission .",
    "this simplified model neglects other contributions to the gamma - ray background , including point sources  both galactic and extra - galactic  which we assume can be identified and removed .",
    "we also neglect other dark matter sources , including diffuse emission from the milky way halo and from cosmological halos , as we are in particular concerned with isolating the subhalo contribution . given the latitudes that we consider for our analysis this model is appropriate  @xcite . as we argue here",

    "we are implicitly assuming here that the pdf s of both background components  galactic and extra - galactic  are poisson , as opposed to the pdf of the subhalo contribution which is captured in @xmath17 .",
    "this is the best one could hope for when examining the utility of the pdf ; if the pdf turns out not to matter much in our analysis , then this will be a robust conclusion . in the rest of this section ,",

    "a thermally averaged cross section of @xmath52 @xmath4 s@xmath5 leads to the correct thermal abundance of dark matter today so that our fiducial value of @xmath53 is easily accommodated in supersymmetric models  @xcite .",
    "thus the mean luminosity in eq .",

    "furthermore , the luminosity depends on the radial position of subhalos ( @xmath55 ) , and we also include a non - zero scatter ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma ] ) ) about the mean value of the luminosity , a scatter which depends on the mass and the galactocentric radius of subhalos .",
    "numerical simulations predict a mass function of the form @xmath56 with @xmath57  @xcite . here",
    "the radial dependence is through @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the scale radius of the milky way halo ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "we normalize the mass function by utilizing the numerical result that roughly 10% of the mass of the galactic halo ( @xmath61 ) is in subhalos of mass greater than @xmath62 . with this assumption ,",
    "the normalization constant is @xmath63 .",
    "simulations also suggest that the halo distribution may be less cuspy near the center than the dark matter profile , and may depend on the mass of the subhalo  @xcite .",
    "this may have implications on the expected annihilation signal from substructure as the overall number of counts along a particular line of sight will be lower than expected ( especially if most of the signal arrives from nearby objects ) .",
    "nevertheless , given the current uncertainties of the level of this effect , we do not include a core in the distribution of subhalos in this study , but we emphasize that the issue of substructure depletion in the inner regions of the galaxy must be addressed in detail in future numerical simulations .      of observing flux @xmath12 from a single halo in a given square degree pixel .",
    "we measure flux in units of photons / beam / year , where a ` beam ' corresponds to the approximate effective area of the fermi telescope , @xmath64 .",
    "the solid curve uses luminosity and mass functions from this paper with @xmath65 , while the dashed curve uses the same functions with @xmath66 .",
    "the dotted curve shows @xmath67 from ref .",
    "@xcite with @xmath65 , re - scaled to have the same mean flux as our @xmath67 for the purpose of comparison.,title=\"fig : \" ]    with the above ingredients we construct the probability of observing a single subhalo with flux @xmath12 in pixel @xmath8 , @xmath68 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] for @xmath69 . in generating this figure ,",
    "we have used flux units of photons / beam / year , where the beam corresponds to the detector area of the fermi telescope , @xmath70 ( the true effective area of fermi is energy dependent so this value is only approximate ) .",
    "of particular note in this figure is the smoother fall off at low flux in our model relative to the model of  @xcite ( for the purpose of comparison we have scaled the  @xcite model so that it predicts the same mean flux as our model ) .",
    "as both of these models assume a sharp mass cut - off at the low end , the difference in fall - off at low flux follows directly from the scatter in luminosity for a given mass .",
    "when the low end mass cut - off , @xmath35 , is changed , we see from fig .  [",
    "fig : f1 ] that the mean flux per subhalo decreases but that the shape of @xmath71 remains essentially unchanged .",
    "also , note that the pdf s for both models are very similar at the high flux end as a result of competing differences between the mass functions and the mass - luminosity relations of the two models . for a mass function that goes as @xmath72 and a mass - luminosity relation such",
    "that @xmath73 , it can be shown that for large values of @xmath12 , @xmath74 with @xmath75 . for our model we have @xmath76 while for the  @xcite model they have @xmath77 .",
    "thus , in both models @xmath78 is approximately proportional to @xmath79 for large @xmath12 .",
    "physically , our less - steep mass function means that we have more high mass ( and thus high luminosity ) subhalos than the  @xcite model , but our less - steep luminosity function means that these subhalos are not as bright .",
    "the end result is that on the high flux end both models are very similar .",
    "we use @xmath80 to determine @xmath11 , the probability of observing a total flux from multiple subhalos at angle @xmath9 from the galactic center .",
    "the two functions are related by @xmath81 where @xmath82 indicates a fourier transform with respect to @xmath12 and @xmath83 is the mean number of subhalos in a given pixel : @xmath84}{dmdv}.\\ ] ] @xmath85 is the solid angle of a single pixel , taken here to be one square degree .",

    "[ eq : pf ] is presented in the appendix of  @xcite .",

    "[ fig : f2 ] shows the calculated @xmath86 for the dark matter signal for one year of observation by the fermi telescope .",

    "also , note that despite the differences between our model and that of @xcite , both produce pdfs that are very similar .",
    "apparently , the differences between the two models are washed out through the transition to @xmath11 and the subsequent discretization to produce @xmath86 .",
    "the similarity between the two models is encouraging : it suggests that the form of @xmath86 is somewhat independent of the many assumptions that go into such models ( e.g. the mass function , the luminosity function , @xmath35 , etc . ) , thus making our conclusions more robust .    in table",
    "[ table : counts ] we show the expected number of counts for our fiducial model , as well as four other models where we vary the cutoff scale of the mass function and the concentration ( and substructure mass fraction ) of the host milky way halo .",
    "the effect of the subhalo mass function cutoff on the photon counts is due to the fact that the luminosity increases with mass at a slower rate than the rate at which the abundance is increasing with mass - _ numerous _ small ( and faint ) subhalos yield a higher flux than _ few _ large and bright subhalos .",
    "the effect is not very large , as decreasing @xmath35 by four orders of magnitude results in only a factor of @xmath88 increase in the photon counts .",
    "still , understanding the low - mass cutoff scale of the subhalo mass function is important in any future interpretation of @xmath89-ray data .",
    "the high and low concentration models in table  [ table : counts ] refer to models @xmath90 and @xmath91 respectively in @xcite .",
    "they represent host milky way halos with high ( @xmath92 ) and low ( @xmath93 ) concentrations .",

    "this is an outcome of hierarchical structure formation .",
    "high concentration host halos were formed earlier and therefore their constituent subhalos evolved for a longer period of time in the presence of the tidal field of the host , thus the subhalo survival rate is lower than in the low concentration ( recently formed ) hosts . as can be seen from table  [ table :",

    "our total number of counts is obtained by summing over all photons with energy above 1 gev .",
    "we choose this energy threshold mainly because most of the photons emitted by dark matter pairs with mass @xmath107 gev or greater are above this energy , and also because the diffuse galactic emission is observed to be a steeply falling power law near these energies .",

    "@xcite and fleshed out here with a slightly less restrictive model , should produce in fermi many pixels with zero or small number of counts but a finite set with large number of counts .",
    "we have addressed here the question of how this pdf will affect future analyses and concluded that , once the backgrounds are added in , a simple analysis which assumes a poisson pdf is unbiased and only slightly less powerful than one which uses the full , correct pdf .    to some extent",
    "this is good news : there is a tension between analyses which are agnostic as to the nature of the signal and those which assume that many of its underlying features are known and are simply fitting for parameters .",
    "those in the first class are more robust and believable because they are based are fewer assumptions ; those in the second are more powerful statistically and will lead to tighter constraints on the properties of dark matter .",
    "when we find little loss in statistical power from dropping an assumption and moving towards more agnostic estimators , we should become more optimistic about our chances of extracting a signal hidden in backgrounds .",
    "this is perhaps the most important result of this work .",
    "lingering in our discussion , and in the literature at large  ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , is the question how much information will the data contain ?",
    "the answer to this is encoded in the likelihood function , and our conclusions are that one year of fermi data contains enough information to detect a value of @xmath137 @xmath4 s@xmath5 gev@xmath101 .",
    "we are not claiming that a robust detection of this small a signal can be expected ( for an incomplete sample of analyses , see  @xcite ) , but just that the information is there and we should attempt to extract it .    our analysis has included / assumed two types of information about the signal and backgrounds : the angular distribution and the pdf .",
    "we have not included two other potential discriminants : the spectral shapes of the different components and the angular two - point functions .",
    "the former is easy to include within the formalism developed here , and we plan to address this in future work .",
    "the latter has been explored by a number of authors  @xcite in the form of the @xmath139 s .",
    "there is a connection between our work and the fluctuations explored elsewhere : we have implicitly assumed a flat @xmath139 spectrum , but one that has a larger amplitude than poisson ( because the pdf is not poisson ) . whether or not this set of assumptions includes",
    "all of the effects explored elsewhere is an open question .",

    "<S> detecting the dark matter annihilation signal from galactic substructure , or subhalos , is an important challenge for high - energy gamma - ray experiments . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we discuss detection prospects by combining two different aspects of the gamma - ray signal : the angular distribution and the photon counts probability distribution function ( pdf ) . </S>",
    "<S> the true pdf from subhalos has been shown recently ( by lee et al . ) to deviate from poisson ; we extend this analysis and derive the signal pdf from a detailed @xmath0cdm - based model for the properties of subhalos . </S>",
    "<S> we combine our pdf with a model for galactic and extra - galactic diffuse gamma - ray emission to obtain an estimator and projected error on dark matter particle properties ( mass and annihilation cross section ) using the fermi gamma - ray space telescope . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the estimator obtained from the true pdf to that obtained from the simpler poisson analysis . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , although both estimators are unbaised in the presence of backgrounds , the error on dark matter properties derived from the true pdf is @xmath1 smaller than when utilizing the poisson - based analysis . </S>"
