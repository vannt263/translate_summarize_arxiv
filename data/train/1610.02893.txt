    "in this work we investigate the effect of particle production on the early stages and later evolution of cosmological models with non - zero spatial curvature . unlike in standard perfect fluid cosmologies without particle production or viscous effects ,",
    "the curvature terms dominate at very early times .",
    "cosmological particle production has been intensively examined as part of the universe s early evolution .",
    "the first investigations focussed on the potentially isotropizing effects of created particles in anisotropic universes @xcite , although they ran the risk of overproducing entropy @xcite .",
    "grishchuk @xcite provided a classical counterpart to quantum production that produced amplification of gravitational waves when the expansion dynamics deviated from those of radiation - domination .",
    "later , many investigations showed how particle production by a time - varying gravitational field in an early inflationary era of accelerated expansion could generate observable effects in the form of scalar and tensor perturbation modes .",
    "a period of late - time accelerated expansion might also be described in such a framework , see for example refs .",
    "this particle production mechanism offers an alternative way to view the early accelerating phase @xcite and it has also been noticed that it allows for a universe which experiences two de sitter phases ( at early and late times ) with an intermediate period of radiation and matter dominated phases @xcite . moreover , gravitational particle production may have some impact on structure formation in our universe @xcite . originally ,",
    "research in this direction was motivated by the macroscopic particle production at the expense of gravitational field in a background of a non - equilibrium thermodynamics which naturally incorporates a negative back - reaction term in the einstein s field equations @xcite and hence , without any presumption of a dark energy component or modifications to gravity , an accelerating universe can be realized . just as the equation of state for any dark energy fluid , or the particular forms for any modification of general relativity play a key role in determining different cosmic phases ,",
    "so with particle production the dominant role is played by the rate of particle production , @xmath0 @xcite .    in what follows we investigate cosmological solutions with ` adiabatic ' particle production in the presence of spatial curvature ( or an equivalent fluid ) .",
    "we take the particle production rates to be free parameters and start from the simplest possibility , of a constant creation rate , and then progress to a very generalized functional form .",
    "this is motivated by the discovery that the presence of spatial curvature can dominate the dynamics near the singularity in analogous bulk viscous cosmology @xcite : this is the opposite to the situation without bulk viscosity or particle creation present .",
    "we focus mainly on the exact analytic solutions of the einstein s field equations by applying the method of singularity analysis to the differential equations as we did recently in modified gravity theories @xcite .",
    "we find that the gravitational equations for two specific models of matter creation pass the singularity test , which means that the solution can be written as a laurent series around the movable singularity .",
    "we discuss the possible evolution of open and closed universes driven by gravitational particle production .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : ede ] we define our cosmological model with matter creation terms . in order to investigate the existence of analytical solutions ,",
    "we apply the method of movable singularities to the differential equations for two models . for arbitrary matter creation rate , we find that the scale factor @xmath1 satisfies the field equations . in section [ sec : constantrate ]",
    "we give the exact solution for a constant matter creation rate , while in section [ sec : varyingi ] we study the time - varying particle creation functions @xmath2and @xmath3 .",
    "the stability properties of the special solution @xmath4 are also studied . in section",
    "[ sec : varyingii ] , we consider a general time - varying particle production rate and we present the corresponding cosmological solutions at the small and large time limits .",
    "further , in section [ two - fluid ] , we have briefly outlined how the effect of a non zero curvature in the cosmology of matter creation is recovered when a second perfect fluid is introduced as an alternative to the curvature fluid .",
    "finally , in section [ discu ] we discuss our results and draw conclusions .",
    "we assume that the geometry of our universe is described by the friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) metric @xmath5   , \\label{cp.01}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the expansion scale factor , and @xmath7 is the curvature scalar which describes a flat , open or closed universe for @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "in such a metric , the einstein s field equations for a fluid endowed with particle creation can be written as @xmath9@xmath10 where an overdot represents one time cosmic time differentiation ; @xmath11 , @xmath12 , are respectively the energy density and the thermodynamic pressure of the matter content ; and @xmath13 denotes the creation pressure which is related to the gravitationally induced ` adiabatic ' particle production by @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the hubble rate of the flrw universe , and @xmath16 is some unknown creation rate . in principle , the exact functional form can be determined from the quantum field theory in curved spacetimes .",
    "however , to close the system of equations ( [ friedmann1 ] ) and ( [ friedmann2 ] ) , we assume the fluid component obeys a perfect fluid equation of state @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is a constant .",
    "now , for the above equation of state , the essential conservation equation ( @xmath19 ) can be written and solved as @xmath20 , \\label{consol1}\\ ] ] which follows from ( [ friedmann1 ] ) and ( [ friedmann2 ] ) . for slow particle production , @xmath21 , eqn .",
    "( [ conservation ] ) reduces into @xmath22 , and @xmath23 , that means the standard evolution equation of the perfect fluid is recovered .",
    "however , @xmath24 can allow the exponential particle production term to dominate the adiabatic decay term in ( [ consol1 ] ) .",
    "so , clearly , the rate of particle production significantly effects on the evolution equations .",
    "however , one may find that a nonvanishing creation rate @xmath0 , is similar dynamically to the effects of a bulk viscous pressure @xcite , although they differ from the thermodynamic view point @xcite .",
    "the right - hand side of eqn .",
    "( [ conservation ] ) is replaced by @xmath25 in the presence of a bulk viscosity coefficient @xmath26 , which is often chosen to be proportional to a power of @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "an important question immediately follows from these observations as to what the possible forms of @xmath0 should be .",
    "the particle creation process is motivated by the quantum field theory ( qft ) in curved spacetime @xcite , so in principle one can determine @xmath0 using qft in curved spacetime .",
    "unfortunately , qft can not yet provide an exact functional form for @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , it is more convenient to make a general choice of the rate and examine its effects on the cosmological model .",
    "this will allow us to determine constraints on the rate of particle production from its testable effects on cosmological evolution . by combining any two independent field equations of ( [ friedmann1 ] ) , ( [ friedmann2 ] ) and ( [ conservation ] )",
    ", we get the following single second - order nonlinear differential equation @xmath27 whose solution tells us the evolution of @xmath6 once the creation rate , @xmath28 , is specified .",
    "it is easy to see that the equation ( [ ode ] ) always admits the power - law solution,@xmath29 where @xmath30 , which means that the signature of the spacetime is lorentzian if  @xmath31 .",
    "it is important to note that , for the solution @xmath32 in eq .",
    "( [ sol1 ] ) , we have @xmath33 , hence @xmath34 and so from eq .",
    "( [ cp ] ) we find that @xmath35 .",
    "this means that we do not experience any effects of matter creation in the cosmological solutions .",
    "let us introduce the total equation of state of the fluid , @xmath36 , where @xmath37 with @xmath38 this means that the total fluid can behave like dust , radiation , or a pure cosmological constant , depending on different bounds on the creation rate @xmath0 . in the following sections",
    ", we shall consider different rates of particle creation in order to find exact solutions .",
    "suppose that @xmath39 is a constant .",
    "equation ( [ ode ] ) can be reduced to a first - order ordinary differential equation which follows from the autonomy of equation ( [ ode ] ) , which is equivalent to the invariance of the theory under different lapse transformations of the form , @xmath40 however , first we apply the method of singularity analysis to determine the analytic solutions .",
    "let us apply the ars algorithm @xcite in order to see if equation ( [ ode ] ) passes the singularity test and the solution can be written as a laurent expansion .",
    "we change variables @xmath41 , so eq . ( [ ode ] )",

    "we see that now eq .",
    "( [ sol1 ] ) becomes @xmath44 .",
    "assume that the latter has the dominant behavior around the movable singularity @xmath45 , in the complex plane .",
    "we assume a solution of the form @xmath46 in eq .",
    "( [ sol2 ] ) and linearize it around @xmath47 , in order to determine the position of the resonances .",
    "we find that @xmath48 , or @xmath49 .",
    "the existence of the first resonance tells us that our analysis is correct and the movable singularity exists .",
    "the second resonance gives us the position of the second integration constant .",

    "we see that for @xmath51 , we have @xmath52 , while @xmath53 for @xmath54 and @xmath55 for @xmath56 .",

    "however , in order to claim that eq .",
    "( [ sol2 ] ) passes the singularity test ,  we need to check the consistency of the solution . to do that",
    "let us write the solution for some values of the barotropic parameter @xmath18 .",
    "assume that the perfect fluid is radiation , i.e. @xmath59 , then @xmath60 , which gives that the laurent expansion is a left painlev series ; specifically@xmath61 where , by substituting eq .",
    "( [ sol3 ] ) into eq .",

    "the latter solution is different from the solution in eq .",

    "( [ ode2f ] ) , we can follow our previous analysis . for @xmath39 , when the second fluid is dust ( @xmath262 ) , we find that the dominate term is @xmath263 , while the resonances are @xmath264 and @xmath265 .",
    "consider the special case in which @xmath266 , which means that both fluids are dust fluids , but particle creation rate exists for the fluid defined by @xmath267 . in that special case , with the use of group invariant transformations , equation ( [ ode2f ] ) can be solved with the method of quadratures .",
    "for instance , if we select @xmath268 , then for constant matter creation rate , we find the solution @xmath269    alternatively , using @xmath270 and @xmath271 , we obtain@xmath272 while the reduction @xmath273 , @xmath274 , yields the solution@xmath275 where @xmath276 and @xmath277 are constants .    from eq .",
    "( [ ode2fe ] ) we can easily find the scale factor in the closed form @xmath278 which is only one particular solution of the problem where @xmath279 is another constant .",
    "an immediate observation from the above solution of the scale factor shows that it may encounter with a finite time singualrity . for @xmath280",
    ", one finds that the singuarity occurs at @xmath281 , therefore for @xmath282 , @xmath283 becomes real and the above solution for the scale factor admits a finite time singularity . also for @xmath122 , @xmath284 , that means in future evolution no finite time singularity is observed . in the same way , except the constant creation rate",
    "other models can be examined .",
    "however , the analysis of these models exceeds the purpose of this work and we end it here .",
    "the theory of gravitational particle production has been the main subject of this paper and specifically in a non - zero spatial curvature of a homogeneous and isotropic universe .",
    "we gave the gravitational field equations and reduced them to a non - autonomous second - order differential equation . in order to prove the existence of solutions",
    ", we used the method of singularity analysis .",
    "in particular , we searched for movable singularities for the matter creation rate functions  ( a ) @xmath285 constant , ( b ) @xmath286and ( c ) @xmath287 .",
    "we showed that for functions ( a ) and ( b ) the differential equations can pass the singularity test and the analytical solution can be expressed in terms of laurent series expansions .",
    "the latter is not true for the creation rate ( c ) .    a special exact solution exists with a linear scale factor @xmath288 which corresponds to the milne solution of vacuum spacetime with negative spatial curvature .",
    "we studied the stability of this solution and found that for @xmath130 in model ( a ) , and @xmath179 in model ( b ) , the linear scale factor is a stable solution to the future . for the model ( c ) ,",
    "the linear solution is stable for @xmath130 .",
    "that was also demonstrated by the study of the qualitative behaviour for the total equation of state parameters .",
    "we found that when @xmath128 and @xmath183 in the two models ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively , the total fluid acts as a cosmological constant , while in case ( c ) , the total fluid has an equation of state parameter like a spatial curvature , with @xmath131 .",
    "further , we studied the qualitative evolution of the cosmological model for a general time - varying matter creation function and we found the conditions under which the universe is dominated by the curvature term or the matter creation term .",
    "finally we showed how in the case of spatially flat flrw universe the presence of a second perfect fluid with an appropriate equation of state can reproduce the effects of curvature .",
    "some special solutions have been given while the complete analysis of these models is the subject of a forthcoming work .",
