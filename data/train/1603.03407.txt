    "following that , we established the above mentioned correlations between two @xmath0wave halo observable , like , e.g. , the width of the momentum distribution with @xmath8 , matter radius with @xmath8 , and the width and matter radius . in particular , this last one was useful to constrain the virtual state energy of @xmath4c , as will be discussed in detail .    in our work , the data for the core recoil momentum distribution extracted from the halo fragmentation reaction , is interpreted on the basis of the serber model @xcite , where the peak around zero momentum is proportional to the momentum distribution .",

    "it is visible the contribution of distributions with a narrow and wide widths .",
    "the narrow momentum distribution is associated with the two neutrons in the halo state , and the wide one to the neutrons in the inner orbits in @xmath1li and inside the @xmath17li core . adopting such interpretation",
    ", the final core momentum distribution is an incoherent sum of two distributions one narrow and another wide .",

    "@xcite . for such estimate",
    "we use the two - neutron separation energy of @xmath21 kev  @xcite .    the above description applied to @xmath3c as formed by two neutrons in a weakly - bound halo with a core of @xmath6c , one expect that the core recoil momentum distribution presents itself as a narrow peak on the top of a wide one , once the halo neutrons occupy an @xmath22 state .",
    "the narrow and wide peaks should be associated with well separated length or momentum scales , in order to characterize a true two - neutron halo state .",

    "it was also found an universal ratio between the magnitude of the log - periodic spectator functions in the limit of @xmath68 , which is a function of only the mass ratio @xmath53 .",
    "we noticed that in practice the first cycle is enough to get the properties of the wave function in the infrared momentum region , which is acceptable for our purposes of computing the width of the momentum distribution .",
    "this happens because in the actual cases of for example , @xmath1li and @xmath3c , one finds that @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , our calculation of the scaling law for the width of the core recoil momentum distribution is close to the universal limit cycle already in the first cycle .",
    "we have checked in @xcite that correlation between the width and @xmath8 of the ground , first and second excited states are quite close and in practice the limit cycle for this scaling law is achieved with the ground state calculation , of the renormalized zero - range three - body model  ( see e.g. @xcite ) , namely given by the subtracted skorniakov and ter - martirosian equations for mass imbalanced systems  @xcite .    the utility of a scaling function in few - body physics was recognized long ago by phillips  @xcite in the analysis of the doublet neutron - deuteron scattering length through the correlation with the triton binding energy , which he found quite model independent . in",
    "the 80 s efimov showed that the origin of the model independence of the  phillips line \" is the universal long range potential , which emerges close to the unitary limit ( infinite two - body scattering length ) .",
    "our approach just follows that idea , searching for the correlation between any other two three - body low - energy @xmath0wave observable , by using the zero - range model to compute the associated scaling law .",
    "one can use a scaling function to estimate for example the value of @xmath8 or @xmath70 , knowing one of them and eventually use it to constrain some other poorly known low - energy observable , such as a subsystem scattering length .",

    "just by adopting @xmath47 31 mev / c the matter radius basically goes to the core radius @xmath48 3 fm .",
    "the lower bounds of 20@xmath4915 mev / c and 34@xmath4921 mev / c , taken together with the scaling function seems consistent with the matter radius .",
    "however , the central values of @xmath97 suggests that the matter radius is overestimated . in order to be consistent with the matter radius",
    "the distribution should be quite narrow according to the scaling function .",

    "[ fig : c22 - 3 ] completes our analysis of the two - neutron separation energy in @xmath3c .",
    "we show @xmath8 as a function of @xmath70 .",
    "the data values for @xmath70 suggest that @xmath8 could have larger values than estimated before , and stay above 100 kev . taking as reference the data with the average between positive and negative momentum around the maximum of core momentum distribution peak , i.e. , @xmath47 20@xmath4915 mev / c",
    ", one gets @xmath98 400 kev and @xmath99 3.5 fm .",
    "the values of @xmath70 equal to 31 mev / c @xcite and 34@xmath4921 mev / c ( [ d1 ] ) suggest much larger values of the two - neutron separation energy about 800 kev and 900 kev , respectively",
    ". the neutron halo of @xmath3c in this case would be quite small compared to the corresponding one in @xmath1li , and possibly would not justify the increase of the reaction cross section of @xmath3c compared to the neighbour nuclei , @xmath5c and @xmath6c , as observed by tanaka and collaborators @xcite , in the collision of @xmath3c on a liquid hydrogen target .",
    "this fact together with the clear presence of the narrow peak in the core recoil momentum distribution point our analysis to the value of @xmath100 20 mev / c , @xmath101 400 kev and @xmath102 3.5 fm .",
    "the sensitivity to the virtual @xmath0state energy of @xmath4c is quite small in @xmath70 for a given @xmath8 , but it has a noticeable effect in the matter radius of @xmath3c shrinking considerably the halo as @xmath54 runs from 0 to 1 mev .",
    "that tension between the halo size and the virtual state of @xmath4c indicates that smaller values of @xmath54 below 1 mev are preferred by our analysis .",
    "we rely on the dominance of the efimov physics on the halo properties and in the serber model to interpret the data on the core recoil momentum distribution .",
    "the core recoil momentum distribution of borromean neutron - rich isotopes of light exotic nuclei is studied within a three - body model constituted by a core and two neutrons , where the interaction is dominated by the @xmath0wave channel .",
    "we adopt a renormalized three - body model with a zero - range force , that naturally accounts for the universal efimov physics .",
    "our model is adequate to describe a two - neutron halo weakly bound to a core nuclei , where these neutrons explore with a high probability the classically forbidden region well outside the core .",
    "in addition , the @xmath15 scattering length should be larger than the interaction range .",
    "these conditions are well satisfied by the borromean halo of @xmath1li , the prototype of a weakly - bound radioactive halo nuclei at the neutron drip line .",
    "the core momentum distribution was calculated from the halo wave function in momentum space , obtained from the numerical solution of the subtracted homogeneous skorniakov and ter - martorisyan coupled equations for the zero - range interaction in the the mass imbalanced case .",
    "the inputs are the two - neutron separation energy and the energies of the singlet @xmath14 and @xmath15 virtual states .",
    "we calculated the momentum probability densities for the borromean exotic nuclei @xmath1li , @xmath2be and @xmath3c .",
    "a fair reproduction of the experimental data was obtained in the case of the core recoil momentum distribution of @xmath1li and @xmath2be without resorting to free parameters .",
    "we suggest a simple method to separate out the cross - section data for the fragmentation of the @xmath3c the narrow peak in the core recoil momentum distribution associated with the breakup of the halo structure . for that aim",
    ", we performed the subtraction of a wide distribution associated with the core recoil momentum momentum distribution observed for @xmath6c .",
    "indeed , the data for the fragmentation differential cross - section for the core momentum above 100 mev / c in @xmath3c and @xmath6c seems indistinguishable , which indicates that the two neutrons in the wide part of the distribution come from inner part of the orbits localized within the core .",
    "the inverse of the difference between those cross - sections , after averaging them for positive and negative momentum , present a linear behaviour with @xmath103 , which allows to extract the width of the momentum distribution .",
    "we apply the same fitting procedure to the difference of cross - sections but without the average . with these values at hand",
    ", we proceed to make a combined analysis of the width of the core recoil momentum distribution and matter radius for @xmath3c .",
    "we computed the scaling functions correlating @xmath70 , @xmath8 and the virtual state energies of the two - body subsystems , and also the scaling functions correlating the matter radius with these quantities . from the scaling function correlating @xmath70 and @xmath8 and the experimental data for @xmath70 equal to 31 mev / c @xcite , 20@xmath4915 mev / c and 34@xmath4921 mev / c , it is suggested that @xmath8 could be well above 100 kev larger than previous estimations . from the correlation between the matter radius and @xmath70 , and the reference the value of @xmath104 mev / c ,",
    "one gets : @xmath105 3.5 fm and @xmath98 400 kev .",
    "however , the values of 31 mev / c and 34@xmath4921 mev / c ( [ d1 ] ) suggest much larger values of the two - neutron separation energy , about 800 kev and 900 kev , respectively . in these last two cases",
    ", the halo of @xmath3c would be quite small compared to the corresponding one in @xmath1li , and we believe that it would not justify the increase of the reaction cross section of @xmath3c compared to the neighbour nuclei , @xmath5c and @xmath6c , as the experiment by tanaka and collaborators  @xcite is showing .",
    "in addition , by considering that it is clear the evidence of the presence of a narrow peak in the core recoil momentum distribution , as our analysis , model independent , is pointing out , it seems preferential that @xmath100 20 mev / c , @xmath101 400 kev and @xmath106 3.5 fm .",
    "our study also shows that the sensitivity of the width of the @xmath3c core momentum distribution to the virtual @xmath0state energy of @xmath4c is quite small for @xmath8 fixed , but the matter radius is quite sensitive to it .",
    "the variation of the virtual state of @xmath4c from 0 to 1 mev shrinks considerably the matter radius .",
    "such a tension between the halo size and the virtual state of @xmath4c suggests , within our analysis , that smaller values of @xmath54 below 1 mev are preferred .",
    "such conclusion is based on the belief that the efimov physics , expressed by the calculated scaling laws , dominates the halo properties , and also by considering the validity of the serber model to interpret the data on the core recoil momentum distribution . in short , the combined analysis of the core momentum distribution and matter radius for @xmath3c , on the basis of the scaling laws computed close to the efimov limit ,",
