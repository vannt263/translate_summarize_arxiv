    "in the past few years , a topic that has drawn an ever - increasing amount of interest in the realm of physical systems modeled by nonlinear - schrdinger ( nls ) type equations concerns the examination of solitary waves and their existence , stability and dynamical properties in the presence of spatially inhomogeneous nonlinearities . a review which covers many aspects of this topic can be found in  ref .",
    "@xcite . a ramification that is gaining increased attention within this broader theme concerns the possibility of the existence of bright coherent structures in the context of _ defocusing _ nonlinearities . as is well - known  @xcite , systems with a self - defocusing nonlinearity support wave excitations in the form of dark solitons , vortices , vortex rings etc . , i.e. , structures supported by a non - vanishing background at infinity . however , a fundamental proposal put forth a few years ago @xcite , was that , if the local strength of the self - defocusing in the @xmath0-dimensional space grows with distance @xmath1 from the center at any rate faster than @xmath2 , then bright solitary waves and vortical structures can self - trap within such settings .",
    "subsequently , this class of models was extended to include spatially inhomogeneous nonlinear losses  @xcite , higher - power ( e.g. , quintic ) nonlinearities  @xcite , other waveforms such as domain walls  @xcite , as well as settings related to fermi and bose gases  @xcite , dipolar bose - einstein condensates  ( becs ) @xcite , nonlocal media  @xcite , discrete systems  @xcite , and complex three - dimensional ( 3d ) topological patterns  @xcite .",
    "most recently , the bose - hubbard model with the same type of spatial modulation of the self - repulsive nonlinearity was introduced , and existence of the respective quantum discrete solitons was demonstrated in it @xcite .",
    "another area which has drawn major interest over the past two decades is the study of models based on the discrete nls ( dnls ) equation  @xcite .",
    "dnls systems have been serving not only as fundamental dispersive systems combining nonlinearity and discreteness , but also as models suitable for the direct description of dynamics in arrays of optical waveguides  @xcite and atomic becs loaded into optical lattices  @xcite .",
    "there are numerous other applications of dnls models , ranging from their use as envelope equations for understanding the denaturation of the dna double strand  @xcite , and the localization of energy in granular crystals  @xcite , to the dynamics of protein loops  @xcite .",
    "our aim in the present work is to combine these two important directions by extending the 1d model and analysis presented in a recent work @xcite to 2d lattices .",
    "we will also develop a different approach , examining the problem from the perspective of the well - established anti - continuum ( ac ) limit @xcite , which offers two important advantages .",
    "on the one hand , in the ac limit , which corresponds to vanishing coupling between the nearest neighbors , we are able to construct solutions systematically , by initially exciting a single site , multiple sites ( two for dipole configurations , or four for quadrupole ones ) , as well as possibly all sites in what we refer to as an extended solution .",
    "the same approach allows to produce not only real waveforms ( with relative phases @xmath3 or @xmath4 between adjacent sites ) , but also complex ones , such as discrete vortices .",
    "the latter , have not only been theoretically proposed  @xcite , but also experimentally observed in photorefractive crystals as per the theoretical prediction  @xcite .",
    "the second important advantage is that , following the methodology of  refs .",
    "@xcite , we are able to provide a systematic classification of the spectral stability of the states , while departing from the ac limit . in this way , we are able to predict which states are robust near this limit . we also numerically corroborate these predictions and ,",
    "finally , we use direct simulations to explore the outcome of the evolution of unstable states .",
    "the presentation of the paper is structured as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce the model and present the theoretical analysis of the existence and stability of different states . in section iii , we explore the model in terms of the numerically implemented bifurcation theory ( as concerns the existence and spectral stability ) , and report results of direct simulations of unstable states . in section iv",
    ", we summarize our findings and discuss directions for future research .",
    "generalizing to 2d the considerations of  ref .",
    "@xcite , we consider a dnls model of the following general form : @xmath5 where @xmath6 accounts for the coupling between adjacent wells , and @xmath7 represents the local strength of the nonlinearity .",
    "prototypical examples represent arrays of waveguides in linbo@xmath8  @xcite and atomic becs ( e.g. , of @xmath9rb or @xmath10na gases ) confined in an optical lattice in the superfluid regime  @xcite . as argued in  ref .",
    "@xcite , a local modulation of the kerr coefficient in optics , or a spatial modulation of the scattering length in atomic becs ( via the feshbach resonance ) straightforwardly leads to settings of the type we consider here .    in the present section ,",
    "we develop the analysis in the general form . for the numerical investigation of section iii , we resort to a specific form of the spatial modulation , @xmath11 which is a counterpart of the 1d modulation format adopted in ref .",
    ". we will also often compare our findings to those in the homogeneous lattice with @xmath12 , where solely _ staggered _ solitary modes @xcite can be obtained for the presently considered nonlinearity of the defocusing sign .",
    "our first aim is to construct stationary states in the form of @xmath13 with chemical potential ( in terms of the bec ) @xmath14 , which leads to an equation for @xmath15 : @xmath16 with @xmath17 .",
    "the total norm of the mode is defined in the usual form , @xmath18 and is a conserved quantity of the model .",
    "families of stationary solutions are characterized below by dependences @xmath19 for @xmath20 , see fig .",

    "it is also possible to cast these dependences into the form of @xmath21 for @xmath22 : as follows from eqs .",

    ", we can choose to excite any configuration in the ac limit , with an arbitrary phase pattern .",
    "the actual issue is which ones of these configurations persist at finite values of inter - site coupling @xmath6 . to address it ,",
    "works @xcite , @xcite , and  @xcite ( for 1d , 2d , and 3d cubic lattices , respectively ) have developed a  persistence condition \" , which we now adapt to the present setting .",
    "suppose that a string of three sites is excited , with coordinates @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "then the persistence condition , adapted to the present setting , reads : @xmath39 pertaining to two - point functions defined for adjacent pairs of sites , it can be generalized for any set of such pairs of sites .    in 1d , given that this set of two - point functions is the same for all sites up to @xmath40 , for solutions that vanish at infinity , the persistence condition allows only configurations with relative phases @xmath3 or @xmath4 . however , this is no longer the case in 2d , as the condition can be satisfied over closed contours without the need to extend the considerations to infinity . as a result ,",
    "in the latter setting complex configurations , including vortices , are possible .",
    "nevertheless , the simpler configurations are the ones with relative phases @xmath41 or @xmath4 , which we predominantly consider below .",
    "particular configurations that we aim to study are :    1 .   a single - site solution with @xmath42 and vanishing amplitude at all other sites .",
    "2 .   a  dipolar \" state resting on a pair of sites , e.g. , @xmath43 and @xmath44",
    ". these two sites may be excited _",
    "in_- or _ out_-of - phase .",
    " quadrupole \" configurations supported by four sites .",
    "although additional structures can also be considered ( which is true for the dipolar modes too ) , we restrict our considerations here to the square - shaped set of four sites @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 . qualitative conclusions that we will infer for the stability will not be different if we choose another quartet of sites , although details may differ .",
    "we also consider the extended unstaggered solution in which _ all _ sites of the lattice are excited with the same sign , as @xmath47 , cf .",
    "( [ tf ] ) . actually , the 1d counterpart of such a state was the subject of  the analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite , while solutions which amount to single- or few - site excitations in the ac limit were not considered in that work .",
    "5 .   finally ,",
    "while for the above - mentioned square - shaped quartet of sites , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , with @xmath33 taken even in both @xmath48 and @xmath49 , we were unable to continue vortical solutions for finite @xmath6 , nevertheless , we were able to do so for a cross - shaped quartet , @xmath44 , @xmath46 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , which features an empty site at the center .",
    "now , we turn to the consideration of the stability of the discrete configurations . to this end , we employ the usual linearization ansatz for perturbations with small amplitude @xmath52 : @xmath53 ,   \\label{d2dnls4}\\]](where @xmath54 denotes complex conjugate ) deriving equations at order @xmath55 for @xmath56 . for simplicity ,",
    "we mention here only the ensuing eigenvalue problem in the case when the unperturbed solution @xmath15 is real , also using the decomposition  @xcite @xmath57 and @xmath58 @xmath59 in these expressions the linear operators are defined as follows : @xmath60 and @xmath61 . rewriting the above non - self - adjoint eigenvalue problem as a combined fourth - order one",
    ", we obtain @xmath62 it is relevant now to point out that near the ac limit of @xmath63 , @xmath64 becomes a multiplicative operator with positive entries , which is obviously invertible .",
    "forming the inner product of eq .",
    "( [ d2dnls6 ] ) with @xmath65 , we obtain @xmath66 where @xmath67 denotes the standard inner product . given the multiplicative nature of @xmath64 in the ac limit , the leading - order approximation near @xmath30 yields @xmath68 for excited sites with @xmath69 [ and @xmath70 for the non - excited ones ] .",
    "thus , eigenvalues of the above - mentioned real solutions are directly associated with operator @xmath71 , up to the above - mentioned multiplicative factor @xmath72 ( henceforth , without loss of generality , we will set @xmath73 ) .",
    "it is straightforward to see that for all the non - excited sites with @xmath31 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 .",
    "these eigenvalues will form , as @xmath6 becomes nonzero , the continuous spectrum which , in the 2d setting , corresponds to the interval @xmath76 $ ] . on the other hand , the eigenvalues that may lead to instability ( at least for small @xmath6 ) are those stemming from the excited sites for which @xmath71 vanishes to the leading order ,",
    "hence these eigenvalues are @xmath77 at @xmath30 . in principle , these eigenvalue pairs may become real immediately as @xmath6 becomes nonzero .",
    "it is then of critical importance , as regards the stability , to identify eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath78 . upon obtaining eigenvalues @xmath79 of the matrix @xmath80 , based on the theory presented in refs .",
    "@xcite ( see also  @xcite ) and the above exposition , the eigenvalues @xmath81 of the full problem will be given , in view of eq .",
    "( d2dnls7 ) , by @xmath82 .",
    "we perform this calculation below for two- and four - site real excitations . for the single - site excitation ,",
    "there is only one pair at @xmath83 .",
    "actually , for all configurations one pair always remains at the origin , due to the phase / gauge invariance of the model ( in the case of the single - site excitation , it is the sole one , so there is no bifurcation occurring ) .",
    "for the extended solution , since all sites are excited , the number of pairs of eigenvalues at the origin is equal to the number of nodes in the lattice , hence the corresponding matrix @xmath80 also has the same number of rows and columns . finally , for the only genuinely complex configuration considered here , the computation of matrix @xmath80 is considerably more complicated , as it should be performed at a higher order [ @xmath84 , rather than @xmath85 , as the relevant excited sites are two lattice spacings apart and only couple at @xmath84 ] .",
    "we do not present details of that calculation here .    in the case of two - site excitations ,",
    "the matrix @xmath80 can be computed explicitly ( upon calculating the leading order i.e. , an @xmath85 correction to the solution ) as @xmath87here , we assume that the two excited sites are @xmath37 and @xmath38",
    ". the eigenvalues are then @xmath88 and @xmath89 , where @xmath90 one of them , as indicated above , remains at the origin , while the other grows along the real axis for out - of - phase excitations ( making these immediately unstable as @xmath6 becomes nonzero ) or along the imaginary axis for in - phase excitations , which does not lead to immediate destabilization . in both cases , note that the inequality @xmath91 leads to a growth rate for these eigenvalues which is larger than that of the homogeneous limit of constant @xmath12 .",
    "furthermore , even for the in - phase mode , which is stable for small @xmath6 , as the respective imaginary eigenvalues grow according to @xmath92 [ recall @xmath93 is defined by eq .",
    "( [ c ] ) ] , they eventually collide with the edge of the above - mentioned continuous spectrum , at @xmath94 , leading to an oscillatory - instability threshold , @xmath95 . given the larger growth rate of the imaginary eigenvalue pair bifurcating from the origin , this instability occurs at smaller values of @xmath6 in comparison to the homogeneous limit of @xmath96 .",
    "we now turn to the four - excited - site case , which is considerably more complicated . here , the reduced matrix @xmath80 is of size @xmath97 . labeling the relative phase factors as @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 , we can write the matrix : @xmath102",
    "this matrix has a single zero eigenvalue .",
    "furthermore , if all @xmath1 s are positive , then the eigenvalues @xmath79 are also positive , hence the eigenvalues of the full problem are imaginary at @xmath103 . on the other hand , if one ( or more ) of the relative phase factors @xmath1 is ( are ) negative , then the corresponding number of negative @xmath79 s emerge , leading to pairs of real eigenvalues , and hence instability of the configuration .",
    "these features are directly in line with what is known for the homogeneous defocusing model , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "they are also directly the reverse of the focusing nonlinearity case ( i.e. , the features corresponding to negative @xmath1 in one case correspond to those for positive @xmath104 in the other ) . while , in principle , the eigenvalues of this @xmath97 matrix can be obtained in an explicit analytical form , the expressions are too cumbersome to be useful .",
    "therefore we will now turn to numerical computations , comparing the results with those of the above analysis , whenever possible .",
    "in our numerical analysis , we first explore branches of stationary states and their stability , and then proceed to simulations of the evolution of perturbed solutions .",
    "the first localized state we consider in the ac limit is the single - site one .",
