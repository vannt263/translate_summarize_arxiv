    "how is molecular gas organized in galaxies ? in the disk of the milky way , molecular gas as traced by co is concentrated in giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) with a characteristic size of 50 pc @xcite .",

    "this size is @xmath15 @xmath6 k @xcite , which is an order of magnitude larger than the mean pressure of the local ism @xcite ; this leads to the conclusion that gmcs in the milky way disk are self - gravitating .",
    "gmcs in m31 @xcite and m33 @xcite have similar properties to those observed in the milky way .",
    "the densest parts of gmcs are traced by molecules with larger dipole moments than co , such as hcn , hco@xmath0 , and cs .",
    "these dense gas tracers need a molecular hydrogen density near @xmath5 @xmath6 to be excited collisionally , 100 times greater than co. in the disk , emission from these molecules is limited to the star - forming cores of gmcs @xcite .    however , the molecular gas composition of the central kiloparsec of a spiral galaxy is very different from that of its disk . in the milky way ,",
    "widespread co emission in the inner kpc makes it difficult to differentiate between a distribution of discrete clouds or one in which the molecular gas is organized homogeneously @xcite .",
    "the emission from hcn and cs within @xmath16250 pc of the galactic center is distributed similarly to the co @xcite , suggesting that high density regions are common , at least compared to the average ism density of @xmath161 @xmath6 in the solar neighborhood . in other galaxies ,",
    "dense gas tracers are more concentrated than co in the central kpc and have lower intensities elsewhere @xcite , consistent with observations of the milky way @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the centers of spiral galaxies tend to have high densities and pressures ; bulges have hydrostatic midplane pressures 2 - 3 orders of magnitude higher than those of their disks @xcite .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter br06 ) found a simple relationship in disk galaxies between the hydrostatic midplane pressure and the ratio of molecular to atomic gas that holds in disks and bulges .    in this paper",

    "observations of ngc 6946 in the r , i , and k bands reveal a small bulge ( radius 15  ) within a larger bar ( radius 63  ) @xcite .",
    "recent studies revealed the rich details of its nuclear structure ; @xcite used high resolution images of co to map the molecular gas spiral in the inner 10  , likely caused by an inner stellar bar 15  in length ( see also nir images in @xcite and @xcite ) . a further study used hcn emission in the central 2  as a proxy for star formation in young clusters still embedded in their parent clouds , and combined these data with observations of hii regions to map the total amount of star formation @xcite .",

    "the number density of the dense gas does not appear to vary as a function of @xmath86 or @xmath73 .",
    "we explore the implications of this below .",
    "we discuss two plausible hypotheses for the distribution of dense gas in the central kpc of ngc 6946 .",
    "the dense gas could be concentrated in self - gravitating clumps interspersed throughout a less dense molecular gas medium .",
    "alternatively , the hcn and hco@xmath0 emission could come from a homogeneous component bound not by self - gravity , but by the ambient pressure .",
    "one hypothesis consistent with our observations is that the hcn and hco@xmath0 emission comes from self - gravitating dense clumps interspersed throughout less dense molecular gas traced by co. the internal turbulent pressure of these density peaks is given by : @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the internal gas velocity dispersion and @xmath108 is the density of the gas . in these peaks , @xmath109 is much higher than the ambient pressure as measured by @xmath86 , so without self - gravity the density peaks would be unstable .",
    "this structure is similar in distribution to gmcs in the galactic disk , where hcn and hco@xmath0 are excited in small density peaks inside of a envelope traced by co. we have assumed that the turbulent pressure dominates the thermal pressure in these peaks , as it does in the star forming cores of gmcs .",
    "we used observations of the nearby galactic pdr in orion to estimate the gaussian velocity width of the peaks , @xmath110 km s@xmath25 @xcite . in  [ sec : pdr ] we found that the number density in the inner region of ngc 6946 is constant with @xmath86 and @xmath73 ; using @xmath111 @xmath6 implies @xmath112 @xmath6 k , larger than the calculated hydrostatic midplane pressure everywhere in the galaxy .",
    "therefore , self - gravity likely plays an important role in holding the density peaks together .",
    "if the density peaks are self - gravitating , we can equate the force per unit volume due to turbulent pressure and gravity : @xmath113 where @xmath114 denotes the mass of the density peak and @xmath115 is the size of the peak .",
    "this reduces to the proportionality @xmath116 . using the relation @xmath117",
    "we conclude that @xmath118 similarly , @xcite found for giant molecular clouds in the center of m64 that @xmath119 , significantly different from gmcs in the disks of local group galaxies .",
    "m64 is a galaxy with high ambient pressure and molecular gas content similar to the bulges of normal spirals .",
    "the constraint was determined from observations of @xmath120co , which is better than @xmath121co at mapping dense gas due to optical depth effects , but does not map the density peaks as well as either hcn or hco@xmath0 .",
    "the authors then showed that the clouds were overpressurized compared to the hydrostatic midplane pressure by calculating the internal pressure from their measurements and assuming turbulent pressure was dominant .",
    "here we find the density peaks are apparently overpressurized and that their number densities are constant , and follow the argument in the opposite direction to derive the power law they constrained experimentally .    in the milky way , @xcite used co observations of disk gmcs to find that the surface density of the cloud is approximately constant with cloud size , and therefore the average density is inversely related to the cloud size .",
    "they constrained the relation between the size of the cloud , @xmath122 , and its velocity dispersion to be @xmath123 ( note the distinction between size of the cloud @xmath122 and size of the density peak @xmath115 ) .",
    "since co traces gas less dense than hcn and hco@xmath0 , these results are not necessarily in conflict ; density peaks in milky way clouds may follow the same relation as the density peaks in ngc 6946 even though the clouds as a whole do not .",
    "as @xmath73 decreases , the rise in both @xmath7 and @xmath8 implies that the amount of dense gas available for star formation is increasing . since the density of the peaks is constant , this could result from an increase in the size of individual density peaks , in the number of density peaks above the necessary threshold , or some combination thereof .",
    "if the effect is due to the number of density peaks increasing , this may imply a fundamental unit of star formation , as discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite pointed out a potential hole in this argument : the emission of any molecule with a critical density higher than the median density is expected to be correlated with star formation , regardless of whether the emission and star forming regions are directly associated .",
    "further investigation would be aided by comparing our integrated intensities with the fir intensity at each point .",
    "unfortunately , fir observations with 6  resolution are not yet possible , even with the spitzer space telescope .",
    "alternatively , the emission from hcn and hco@xmath0 could come from homogeneous gas bound by the ambient pressure .",
    "this situation is similar to what is observed in the milky way center , where we see emission from hcn and cs everywhere we see co , within the sensitivity limits ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "that is , despite the best efforts to resolve the dense gas tracer emission into clumps , it still appears to be diffusely distributed .",
    "the mean number density of the gas appears to be larger than the critical density of the dense gas tracers , and there is no need to appeal to self - gravitating dense clumps to explain the observed emission . in this model ,",
    "the dense gas filling factor is much larger than that of the model described in the previous section .    to construct a similar situation in the central kpc of ngc 6946 , support of the molecular gas layer against the gravitational potential",
    "must come not from turbulent pressure , but from thermal pressure : @xmath124 the central hydrostatic midplane pressure is @xmath125 @xmath6 k ; if the support comes from turbulence with a characteristic speed of 3 km s@xmath25 , the implied density would be @xmath126 @xmath6 , which is too low to excite hcn . instead , if the thermal pressure provides the support , then for kinetic temperatures in the range of 50200 k , consistent with those in the center of the milky way , the derived densities are @xmath127 @xmath6 .",
    "these densities are high enough to excite the dense gas tracers , and are marginally consistent with the number densities calculated via the pdr code .",
    "temperatures as low as 50 k are consistent with the pdr calculations with @xmath97 @xmath16 1000 .",
    "higher temperatures would require larger values of @xmath97 , but the radiation field is not constrained by our observations .    even at a distance of @xmath128 pc from the center ,",
    "thermal pressure is likely to play an important role . in this region , we know at least some of the gas has @xmath129 @xmath6 , because we observe emission from the dense gas tracers .",
    "using the pdr code tells us that the temperature of this dense gas is @xmath130 k , which implies a thermal pressure of @xmath131 @xmath6 k. the hydrostatic midplane pressure for these points is @xmath132 @xmath6 k , so thermal pressure in this region can provide a significant portion of the necessary hydrostatic support , if not all of it .",
    "determining whether hydrostatic support at the galactic center comes from turbulent or thermal pressure would point out which of the self - gravitating dense gas model or the homogeneous and pressure bound dense gas tracer model is correct .",
    "we can do this by constraining @xmath97 for the central 10  of ngc 6946 ( see @xcite for details on constraining @xmath97 ) ; if @xmath97 is large ( @xmath133 ) the gas is likely warm and thermal pressure will dominate , and if it is small ( @xmath134 ) the gas is cool and turbulent pressure is more important .",
    "unfortunately , the constraint @xmath105 from @xcite was calculated from c ii observations with a resolution of 55  ; better resolution than this is necessary to differentiate between the two models .",
    "there is a robust correlation between @xmath7 and @xmath86 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pvhcnhco ] ( _ top _ ) ) .",
    "we fit the relation between the two variables with the monte carlo routine , which yielded : @xmath135 where @xmath86 is in @xmath6 k. it is clear that the total emission from hcn increases as @xmath86 rises .     _",

    "the monte carlo fit yielded : @xmath136 where @xmath86 is in @xmath6 k. again , it is clear that @xmath8 rises with increasing @xmath86 .",
    "these two relations appear to have significantly different slopes , but that may be due to the differing resolution of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 maps .",
    "these fits , along with the radial fits in  [ sec : radius ] and the hydrostatic midplane pressure map ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pressure ] ) , indicate that the molecular gas in the central kiloparsec of ngc 6946 is under high pressure , confirming a prediction made in @xcite .",
    "emission from dense gas tracers like hcn and hco@xmath0 is widespread , and their integrated intensity ratios to co are larger than those further from the center .",
    "this gas is in a markedly different state than the local interstellar medium in the galactic disk where the pressure is approximately three orders of magnitude lower . the structure of the molecular gas distribution , whether it is self - gravitating or homogeneously distributed and pressure bound , also bears little resemblance to the local interstellar medium .",
    "the hydrostatic midplane pressure has a nearly linear relationship with the @xmath137 ratio , @xmath138 , over three orders of magnitude in pressure @xcite .",

    "the fit follows the points reasonably well , though the data are slightly displaced toward higher @xmath86 .",
    "however , br06 did see comparable scatter in their original sample around this relation .",

    "both @xmath86 and @xmath138 depend on @xmath9 , and plotting one as a function of the other can lead to misleading correlations .",

    "we include this plot to demonstrate the continued applicability of the fit in the high pressure regime .",

    "the maps are rich with detail , and we have 13 independent data points across the inner @xmath16750 pc of the galactic center in hcn and co , and 7 in hco@xmath0 . the integrated intensities of hcn and hco@xmath0 peak near the center of the galaxy , and fall off from there .    using bima song co 1 - 0 and 2mass @xmath3 band images , we calculated an approximation to the hydrostatic midplane pressure in the center of ngc 6946 .",
