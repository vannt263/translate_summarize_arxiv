    "the ls  5039 system was designated as a high mass x - ray binary based on the _ rosat _ all - sky survey data by @xcite .",
    "the stellar companion is a bright star with v=11.2 and its spectral type is o6.5v((f ) ) .",

    "the compact object is orbiting around the stellar companion with an orbital period @xmath3 days and with eccentricity @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "milliarcsecond - scale collimated outflows extending up to @xmath51000  au were detected by radio observations @xcite .",

    "suzaku _ have enabled us to fully characterize the flux and spectral shape as a function of phase over one and a half orbital periods @xcite .",
    "the _ suzaku _",
    "observations showed that the x - ray spectrum at each orbital phase can be well fit by a power law and that photon indices vary within @xmath61.60 depending on orbital phase .",
    "based on the _ suzaku _ and h.e.s.s .",
    "data , it was concluded that the x - ray emission is likely to be synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons which are also responsible for the vhe @xmath0-ray emission via inverse compton scattering @xcite .",
    "now that the x - ray characteristics of ls  5039 for more than one orbital period has been uncovered by _ suzaku _ , it is crucial to compare the temporal and spectral behavior as a function of orbital phase between the _ suzaku _ data and past x - ray data .",

    "to convert detected counting rate to absolute energy flux for each bin of the light curves .",

    "we adopted variable bin widths to have equalized errors for different data sets .",
    "for the _ suzaku _ data , since the spectral parameters , particularly photon indices , are significantly changed during the observation , we converted the observed counting rate assuming the power - law parameters obtained the left panel of figure [ fig2 ] shows the resulting light curves in the energy range of 110  kev .",

    "the phase - folded x - ray light curves from the _ asca _ , _ xmm - newton _ , and _",
    "observations are in remarkable agreement with those from _",
    "suzaku_. more surprisingly , short - time variability seen in the _ suzaku _ 2007 data can be recognized in the previous 19992005 data .",
    "for instance , a small peak around @xmath27 is evident both in the _ suzaku _ and _ chandra _ data although the two observations are performed almost three years apart .",
    "when the _ suzaku _ data points in @xmath28 excluding the peak structure are approximated to a linear function , the deviation of this peak structure from the continuum corresponds to 5.6 @xmath29 significance .",
    "the flux drop around @xmath30 is also consistent between the _ suzaku _ and _ xmm - newton _ data within statistical errors .",
    "the deviation of the drop structure from an extrapolated linear function determined from the _ suzaku _ data points in @xmath31 is 7.4 @xmath29 significance .",
    "the _ asca _ data , which were obtained 8 years before the _ suzaku _ observation , also reproduce the _ suzaku _ light curve not only for the overall flux increase but also for the small peaks around @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "since the x - ray spike around @xmath27 is located around inferior conjunction ( when the compact object appears between the stellar companion and the observer ) , it seems to be due to a rather geometrical than physical effect in the sense that it is connected to a direction to the observer . in this regard ,",
    "the doppler effect is a possible way of boosting or modulating the x - ray flux along the orbital phase , as pointed out in @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that there are slight differences in the phase - folded light curves .",
    "although a small spike at @xmath27 in the _ suzaku _ light curve agrees well with the _ chandra _ light curve as seen in the left panel of figure [ fig2 ] , it is evident in the right panel that the _ chandra _ spike lasts longer than the _ suzaku _ one by @xmath34 .",
    "also , only the second orbit data of _ suzaku _ shows a dip - like structure at @xmath35 , while there are no such structures in the other data including the first orbit data of _",
    "suzaku_.    the largest systematic errors in flux of each time bin are due to uncertainties in the cross calibration between each detector system .",
    "although cross calibration for a source with hard spectrum like ls  5039 has not been performed extensively , the discrepancy in the absolute flux is thought to be less than 20% in the current calibration uncertainties ( e.g. see http : www.iachec.orgiachec_2008_meeting.html for the current cross calibration issues ) .",
    "this number is rather large if compared to the amplitude of the small structures seen in the light curves .",
    "however , the agreement of the similarity of shapes between _ suzaku _ and other observatories would not simply be a chance coincidence in most cases since the agreement is seen for more than one observation by _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton_. in order to quantitatively estimate the similarity of shapes , we interpolated the _",
    "suzaku _ light curve and compared with each orbital segment s light curve .",
    "the interpolated values are calculated with the _ suzaku _ light curve of 5  ks time bins and a spline function , and @xmath36 values are derived from the difference between the interpolated and each light curves .",
    "each @xmath36 value is pesented in table [ tab : ls5039_obs ] .",
    "the model light curve is acceptable in the confidence level of 1090% from @xmath36 test for each segment .",
    "we note that the issue whether the source is really periodic or not at x - rays , despite the appearance , is still not solved statistically in periodicity analysis .",
    "we have shown that the orbital modulation of ls  5039 is surprisingly stable over the past eight years .",
    "it is remarkable that not only the overall modulation but also the fine structures in the light curve agree well between the data from _ suzaku _ and those from other x - ray observatories .",
    "considering the long - term stability , it is quite difficult to attribute the x - ray emission of ls  5039 to the emission from hot plasma around an accretion disk , which is often observed from black hole binaries in low / hard state , since such emission is generally expected to show unstable and unpredictable time variability @xcite . although the jet formation and the production mechanism of non - thermal radiation in the jet are still unclear , it might be difficult to explain the emission from ls  5039 as synchrotron emission from a jet , since jet activities are thought to be connected to accretion activities and disk instabilities affect the jet formation and radiation @xcite . among currently proposed models for ls  5039 , a scenario in which the radiation is related to an ultrarelativistic pulsar wind @xcite would be able to account for the stable clock - like x - ray and tev @xmath0-ray behavior . in this scenario",
    ", particles move relativistically in the pulsar wind , or are accelerated in shocks created by the interaction of this pulsar wind with the stellar wind .",
    "however , it should be noted that the h.e.s.s .",
    "results do not favor this scenario in its standard form , in which the emitter is expected to be located between the compact object and the stellar companion @xcite . in this case , the absorption is so severe that even cascading can not help to explain disagreement between the measured and predicted fluxes around @xmath20 . in order to avoid the heavy absorption , @xmath0-rays are assumed to be produced at the periphery of the binary system in @xcite , similarly as in @xcite .",
    "it is of importance to compare the results with those obtained for other gamma - ray binaries like psr  b1259@xmath163 and ls i + 61 303 .",
    "in contrast to the ls  5039 case , the x - ray emission from these two objects does not seem to show precise repeating features @xcite .",
    "this might be due to the difference of the stellar object type or compact object in the systems .",
    "while ls  5039 host an o star , both psr  b1259@xmath163 and ls i + 61 303 contains a be star , which is characterized with a dense equatorial disk .",
    "since a stellar disk plays an important role for x - ray emission in the pulsar scenario @xcite , it is possible that changes in disk structure avoid short time repeating features in x - ray modulation .",
    "@xcite actually pointed out that the stellar disk in ls i + 61 303 would be likely disrupted around periastron passage by tidal forces from the compact object . on the other hand",
    ", the emission from ls  5039 may be determined only by the location of the compact object relative to the o star and thus exhibit precise repeating features .",
