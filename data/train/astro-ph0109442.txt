    "the study of star formation is currently at a fascinating stage . with the advent of large millimeter and",
    "submillimeter single - dish telescopes , and interferometers , the earliest stages of star formation have been under considerable observational scrutiny .",
    "the youngest protostars , also known as class 0 sources ( of age a few @xmath2 yrs ) , are so completely embedded in their dust and gas cocoons that they are only detectable longward of mid - infrared wavelengths @xcite .",
    "a typical class 0 protostar consists of a central accreting source ( that may be surrounded by a dynamic accretion disk ) , an extended , massive , rotating infall envelope , and a vigorous bipolar molecular outflow .    while collapse is one of the most important stages of star formation , direct observation of protostellar collapse",
    "is rendered difficult due to the kinematic confusion in star forming regions .",
    "millimeter and submillimeter line profiles are not just affected by collapse motions .",
    "they are also affected by motions such as rotation , outflow and turbulence that are characteristic of the earliest stages of star formation .",
    "much effort has been invested in finding a distinctive signature of infall .",
    "the most used infall signature is the blue asymmetric line profile that is seen in optically thick molecular transitions in the presence of a centrally peaked excitation temperature gradient @xcite .",
    "a _ mapping _ signature based on centroid velocity maps ( dubbed the `` blue - bulge '' signature of infall ) was proposed and subsequently detected towards several class 0 sources @xcite . as long as the emission remains optically thick",
    ", the blue - bulge signature is found to be relatively insensitive to both variations in molecular abundance and source inclination @xcite .",
    "the blue - bulge signature naturally accounts for infall and rotation , and since it occurs along the equatorial direction of the protostar , is expected to be less affected by outflow .    the serpens star - forming core , at a distance of 310 pc , is known to harbor about a half - dozen class 0 protostellar candidates @xcite . as part of a study of the kinematics and evolutionary state of a larger set of ysos @xcite",
    ", we performed a multi - transitional study of all the class 0 objects in the serpens core . in this paper , we concentrate on smm4 , which is the brightest submillimeter continuum object in the southeastern section of the serpens core @xcite , and has the strongest overall h@xmath3co @xmath4 emission of all observed sources in serpens@xcite .",
    "we mapped the cs j=2@xmath11  transition , and three different transitions of hco@xmath0   emission at four different angular resolutions to constrain the infall parameters of this source .",
    "we also mapped a 20  @xmath5 10  region around smm4 in co j=1@xmath10  to determine the orientation and effect of outflows .",

    "several trends can be observed in the hco@xmath0  and cs spectra towards the central position that suggest that infall is occurring towards smm4 .",
    "the noteworthy feature of most of the hco@xmath0  and cs lines ( the main isotope ) in figure [ plotall ] is that they show the classic blue asymmetric line profile , the signature expected for infall .",
    "the millimeter transitions of cs and hco@xmath0  do not show identifiable double - peaked line profiles .",
    "the self - absorption dip in the hco@xmath0j=1@xmath10  line may actually be down at the continuum level ( there is some emission redward of this dip ; see figure[plotall ] ) .",
    "while the cs j=2@xmath11  line profile does not show a clear blue asymmetry , its centroid velocity is clearly blueshifted ( see table [ tbl-2 ] ) .",
    "in contrast , the optically thin isotopic spectra ( the h@xmath10co@xmath0  and c@xmath11s transitions ) appear more gaussian and centered on the v@xmath14 of the object , again as expected in an infall interpretation @xcite .    in all cases , for molecular tracers that probe the infalling material , the centroid velocity of the corresponding main , more optically thick isotope",
    "would be expected to be lower ( bluer ) than its rarer , more optically thin counterpart .",
    "indeed that is the pattern seen for corresponding isotopic pairs for hco@xmath0  and cs in table [ tbl-2 ] .",
    "it would also be expected that higher lying submillimeter transitions show a more pronounced blue asymmetric line profile , since they would preferentially probe regions of greater density and hence larger infall velocities .",
    "indeed , the hht hco@xmath0  j=4@xmath13  transition shows a more pronounced blue asymmetry than the hht hco@xmath0  j=3@xmath12transition .",

    "j=4@xmath13  transition ( see table [ tbl-2 ] ) .",
    "this is probably because the jcmt j=3@xmath12  observation has a higher angular resolution than the hht j=4@xmath13  observation . at higher angular resolution ,",
    "the same transition would probe more embedded regions of higher infall velocity , and hence would be expected to have more pronounced blue asymmetry .",
    "indeed that is the case seen towards the higher resolution jcmt hht hco@xmath0  j=3@xmath12spectrum as compared with the corresponding hht spectrum . the corresponding centroid velocity for the jcmt observed j=3@xmath12transition is also lower ( or bluer ) compared to the hht observed transition ( see table [ tbl-2 ] ) . as expected for an infall interpretation , the fcrao millimeter wavelength cs and hco@xmath0  line profiles , on account of their lower angular resolution and lower critical densities appear to show a less pronounced blue asymmetry compared to the submillimeter transitions . the fcrao co j=1@xmath10  and the hht co",
    "j=3@xmath12  transitions also show blue asymmetric line profiles .",
    "their respective isotopic transitions are more gaussian in appearance and centered about the v@xmath14 of the source . low - lying co transitions , because of their lower critical density",
    "are not expected to be as good tracers of infall as hco@xmath0  or cs .",
    "in addition , co is usually seen to trace outflows in protostellar objects . indeed , in smm4 , as we will show below , the @xmath6co transitions do trace outflow in this system .",
    "table  [ tbl-2 ] shows that for the submillimeter transition of co , the main isotope has a redder centroid velocity that the corresponding rarer isotope .",
    "this would be consistent with co j=3@xmath12  tracing the underlying outflow .",

    "figure [ tauall ] shows the resultant optical depth profiles towards the central position of smm4 .",
    "the optical depth calculations were performed only over the fwhm of the isotopic line .",

    "moreover , it is seen that for similar angular and spectral resolutions , hco@xmath0  has greater optical depth , and hence , seems to trace infall better than cs .",
    "the latter result is probably due to the fact that the dipole moment of hco@xmath0  is twice that of cs , and hence , line and opacity profiles of hco@xmath0  would be expected to show more pronounced asymmetries .",
    "the co j=1@xmath10  and j=3@xmath12  spectra in figure [ plotall ] show deep self - absorption and line wings , suggesting the presence of outflows in this source .",
    "previous attempts at associating specific outflows with the individual submillimeter sources in the serpens cloud have shown a complex set of flows in this region @xcite .",
    "we performed wide - field imaging ( 20@xmath5 12 ) of the co j=1@xmath10  emission towards the serpens region to understand the global distribution of co. higher transitions of co tend to pick up the hotter , denser gas that may be associated with the outflow closer to the driving source , and so we mapped a smaller region of the j=3@xmath12transition around smm4 . in figure",

    "the ehv lobes of co j=1@xmath10   in figure  [ intco ] show several flows .",
    "at least four distinct redshifted lobes are seen : one east of smm3 , one northeast of smm6 , one west of smm1 , and one south and west of smm4 and smm2 .",
    "however , corresponding blueshifted lobes that may form a bipolar flow are seen to be less distinct .",
    "there is one blueshifted lobe west of smm1 .",
    "in the vicinity of smm4 , blueshifted emission occurs to the north of smm4 and to the south and east of smm2 . in the archival jcmt co j=2@xmath11  data shown in the top left of figure  [ intco ] ,",
    "a distinct bipolar flow is seen in the region around smm4 , with ehv blueshifted emission to the north - east of smm4 , and redshifted emission to the south - west .",
    "the lobes seen in the j=2@xmath11  data have good correspondence with the j=1@xmath10  data .",
    "in addition the j=2@xmath11  ehv emission does not seem to trace the lower excitation material seen in the j=1@xmath10  ehv emission .",
    "this detection of outflow towards smm4 is confirmed in the co j=3@xmath12  map obtained with the hht ( top right plot of figure  [ intco ] ) , which also shows the same orientation and direction of the outflow .",
    "curiously , in the j=2@xmath11  map of figure  [ intco ] , the blueshifted lobe of emission north - east of the driving source has a different position angle ( @xmath24@xmath25  measured east of north ) from the redshifted lobe of emission which seems to be directed almost due south of the driving source .",
    "a similar morphology is seen in the co j=3@xmath12  map , with the p.a .",
    "of the blueshifted lobe being even further eastward ( @xmath26@xmath27  east of north ) than in the j=2@xmath11transition .",
    "close to the driving source , it is possible that the redshifted lobe has a similar p.a . to the blueshifted one .",
    "but further downstream ( @xmath13 30   away ) , the redshifted lobe becomes more north - south in direction , possibly due to some interaction of the outflow with the ambient cloud material .",
    "the difference in the position angles of the blue and redshifted lobes of the outflow might be due to precession in the underlying jets .",
    "higher angular resolution observations will be required to test this hypothesis .",
    "the blue - bulge signature is expected to be seen in the centroid velocity maps of optically thick , density sensitive tracers like hco@xmath0 , which preferentially traces the infalling dense cloud core . on the other hand",
    "if hco@xmath0   emission arises mostly from the outflow material , the interpretation of the centroid velocity signature becomes less clear .",
    "do the molecular outflows mapped in co have an effect on the hco@xmath0  line profiles ? to determine this , we made integrated intensity maps of the blueshifted , linecore and redshifted emission of hco+ j=1@xmath10 , j=3@xmath12 , and j=4@xmath13 .",
    "figure  [ inthco ] shows the maps , where the integrated intensity in the line core is shown in grayscale , while the blueshifted and redshifted integrated intensity maps are shown in dashed and solid line contours respectively .",
    "while the linecore integrated intensity maps are expected to trace the dense ( infalling ) molecular cloud core , the linewing maps might indicate if the hco@xmath0   emission is arising from material entrained by the outflow .",
    "the hco@xmath0   j=1@xmath10   linecore integrated intensity map of figure  [ inthco ] is centered on smm4 , but has a morphology that is extended along the direction of the co outflow , as well as orthogonal to it .",
    "the elongation of the linecore emission orthogonal to the outflow might be due to the embedded dense cloud core .",
    "at the same time , the component of the j=1@xmath10   linecore emission that is elongated along the outflow direction might be taken as morphological evidence for the contamination of hco@xmath0   j=1@xmath10   linecore emission from material associated with the high velocity molecular outflow .",
    "the j=1@xmath10   linewing emission also follows these orthogonal directions , but shows heavy contamination by the outflow .",

    "higher - lying transitions of hco@xmath0   have higher critical density and excitation requirements and are expected to be less contaminated by outflow . indeed",
    ", the integrated intensity maps of jcmt hco@xmath0   j=3@xmath12   emission in figure  [ inthco ] show very little evidence for extension along the outflow .",
    "the linecore map appears elliptical and is centered on smm4 , and probably traces the infalling , dense cloud core .",
    "the morphology of the linewing emission is a little more complicated .",
    "there are two distinct lobes of redshifted emission .",
    "the one in the north is probably associated with the redshifted component also seen to the north in the co map ( see figure  [ intco ] ) .",
    "the northern redshifted lobe might be associated with the smm3 source .",
    "other than this , there is a blueshifted lobe to the northwest and a redshifted lobe to the southeast . to study in detail the effects of the outflow on the hco@xmath0   line profiles , in figure  [ cohco ] , we superpose the jcmt co j=2@xmath11   outflow maps of figure  [ intco]b with the jcmt hco@xmath0   j=3@xmath12   maps from figure  [ inthco]b .",
    "several important conclusions can be drawn from this figure .",
    "the hco@xmath0  j=3@xmath12   linewing and linecore emission have similar position angles , and it is approximately orthogonal to the direction of the outflow , which indicates that both linecore and linewing submillimeter hco@xmath0  emission might be tracing the dense starforming cloud core . the redshifted lobe of hco@xmath0  j=3@xmath12   emission is clearly anticorrelated with any outflow emission . on the other hand ,",
    "the blueshifted linewing emission of the hco@xmath0   j=3@xmath12   transition is positionally coincident with the blueshifted lobe of the co outflow .",
    "it is possible that the blueshifed outflowing gas is interacting with dense ambient gas in the foreground giving rise to the blueshifted hco@xmath0  emission seen northwest of smm4 .",
    "due to possibility that some portion of the linewing emission of hco@xmath0   might be contaminated by outflow , in the next section , when we derive the centroid velocity maps , we will only use the linecore of hco@xmath0emission to trace any infall signatures .",
    "the _ linecore _",
    "emission of hco@xmath0  j=3@xmath12   is flattened and elliptical and appears orthogonal to the outflow . from the elliptical lobe of emission in the hco@xmath0j=3@xmath12   linecore",
    "( see figures [ inthco ] and [ cohco ] ) , we estimate a position angle of @xmath30@xmath31  west of north for the major axis of the ellipse .",
    "if this elliptical lobe of emission traced in the hco@xmath0  j=3@xmath12   linecore is tracing a rotating cloud core , then it could be used to constrain the position angle of the outflow , as the outflow would be expected to be orthogonal to the orientation of the cloud core . the approximately northeast - to - southwest direction implied by",
    "the blueshifted outflow lobe is more consistent with the orientation of the hco@xmath0  cloud core , than a north - south outflow implied by the redshifted lobe of the outflow ( see figure  [ intco ] ) .",
    "our numerical modeling of the infall region ( see  [ infall - model ] below ) is also more consistent with a @xmath32   position angle than a north - south orientation for the rotational axis .",
    "a rotating type of structure was also seen in the case of the protobinary iras 16293 , where submillimeter linecore and linewing emission of cs j=7@xmath16   and hco@xmath0   j=4@xmath13   showed evidence for a rotating , circumbinary structure @xcite .",
    "the hco@xmath0   j=4@xmath13   maps seen in the rightmost panel of figure  [ inthco ] also show a similar result . here too , the lincore emission is elongated orthogonal to the outflow , and the hco@xmath0   linewings seem to trace rotation in the cloud core .",
    "the orthogonality of the hco@xmath0   j=4@xmath13   linewing emission from the ehv linewing emission of co j=3@xmath12   ( see figure [ intco ] ) is even more pronounced .",
    "it is also seen that the peaks of redshifted and blueshifted emission of this next higher transition are located closer to the center of smm4 compared to the hco@xmath0   j=3@xmath12   lobes , probably due to the enhanced excitation conditions closer to the center of the object .    in summary ,",
    "the linewing emission of hco@xmath0  becomes progressively less associated with outflow as we go up the rotational ladder .",
    "the linecore emission of the j=3@xmath12   and j=4@xmath13   transitions of hco@xmath0   are likely not impacted by the outflow , while the hco@xmath0   j=1@xmath10linecore emission might be tracing both the embedded cloud core as well as dense shells of the molecular outflow .",
    "the centroid velocity of a line profile is that velocity at which the integrated intensity ( the area under the line profiles ) is equal on either side .",
    "centroid velocity maps have been shown to be a better tool in the detailed study of complicated velocity fields than integrated intensity maps @xcite .",
    "centroid velocity maps of cs and hco@xmath0  emission derived from numerical models of collapse have been shown to be a good indicator of underlying infall _ and _ rotational velocity fields ( @xcite , hereafter nw ) . in the model isovelocity maps of nw , the rotational velocity field imposes a gradient of blueshifted to redshifted velocities , with the sense of the gradient being orthogonal to the rotational axis .",
    "when infall dominates in the central regions , the line profiles in the central region become blue asymmetric , and hence there is a preponderance of blue - shifted velocities in the central regions of the isovelocity maps , giving rise to the so - called `` blue - bulge '' signature .",
    "nw also showed that if the angular momentum content in a given cloud is low , or if the infalling cloud core is observed with low angular resolution , then the blue - bulge signature is `` washed - out '' , that is the central regions of the isovelocity maps just consist of blue - shifted velocities . the first detection of the predicted blue - bulge signature was reported towards iras 16293 @xcite .    in figure [ centall ] , we present the centroid velocity maps of the observed hco@xmath0and cs transitions towards smm4 . the centroid velocities are expressed with respect to the v@xmath14 of the source , i.e. , we have subtracted the v@xmath14 ( 8 kms@xmath33 ) from the centroid velocities , making negative velocities ( shown with dashed lines ) blueshifted , and positive velocities ( shown with solid lines ) redshifted . in an effort to separate out the effect of outflow velocity fields from the dynamics of the cloud core ,",
    "the velocity centroids were computed over _ line core _ velocities . as shown in ",
    "[ hcoint ] , hco@xmath0   linecore emission , especially of the submillimeter transitions , is mostly distinct from effects of molecular outflow .",
    "all four maps shown in figure [ centall ] show an increasing gradient in centroid velocity from the northwest to the southeast .",
    "the contours are seen to be more or less parallel , and is approximately orthogonal to the major axis of the ellipse of hco@xmath0  linecore emission .",
    "the gradient is more ordered and pronounced in the submillimeter transitions .",
    "the blueshifted emission in all four centroid velocity maps are seen to encroach well south of the rotational axis and the central source at ( 0,0 ) , pushing redshifted velocities to the extreme southeastern edge of the map . in figure",
    "[ centall ] , the submillimeter maps of hco@xmath0  j=3@xmath12  and j=4@xmath13 , probably because of the higher angular resolution ( 19   and 21   respectively ) , show the blue - bulge signature more clearly .",
    "the millimeter maps of cs and hco@xmath0   ( bottom panels of figure  [ centall ] ) are at lower angular resolution ( 55   and 60   respectively ) , and as predicted by theory @xcite , at lower angular resolution the blue - bulge signature appears washed out , so that only blueshifted velocities are seen . as was discussed above , even the linecore emission of millimeter hco@xmath0   is affected by outflow . however , the gradient seen in the bottom panels of figure  [ centall ] is not north to south or north - east to south - west , as might be expected if the millimeter lincore emission was only purely tracing the outflow .",
    "the gradient is northwest - southeast which is approximately orthogonal to the outflow .",
    "this argues that the dominant underlying velocities traced by even the millimeter cs and hco@xmath0   linecore emission are rotation and infall .",
    "thus , all four centroid velocity maps in figure  [ centall ] are consistent with the detection of the blue - bulge infall signature towards smm4 .",
    "one of the thorniest problems in the unambiguous detection of infall is the kinematic confusion that exists in protostellar regions .",
    "the velocity fields associated with protostars include _ infall , rotation , turbulence and outflow _ motions . to disentangle these motions",
    ", one needs an accurate physical model for the protostar and a flexible radiative transfer code to predict the appearance of emergent spectra .",
    "such model calculations will help us derive _ observational _ diagnostics and procedures to disentangle the kinematics in _ real _ protostellar systems .",
    "in addition , such models can be used to constrain observations and derive useful physical information of the protostellar region under study .    while there have been several studies of line formation in a spherically symmetric cloud core undergoing only infall motions ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , only a few studies have included rotation into the mix ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we follow the prescription outlined in @xcite in using the tsc @xcite solution of protostellar collapse to model our observations .",
    "the tsc solution naturally accounts for infall and rotation . in table",
    "[ modelfits ] , we present the results of fitting all our observations with the 3-dimensional tsc infall models .",
    "the infall radius r@xmath34 , sound speed @xmath35 , the time since onset of infall t@xmath34 ( t@xmath36 ) , rotational rate @xmath37 , and the turbulent velocity used in the radiative transfer solution are summarized in table  [ modelfits ] .",
    "about fifty model runs were made by varying the infall parameters each time .",
    "the synthetic observations were then convolved to the resolution of the telescopes used in the observations presented in this paper . for the modeling ,",
    "the main and isotopic lines of all the observed cs and hco@xmath0   data from this work were used to obtain best fits to the observations . in the fitting process ,",
    "the entire mapping data obtained observationally are compared with the synthetic model maps .",
    "the best fit model is obtained `` by eye '' , comparing not only the spectral profiles , but also the integrated and centroid velocity maps .",
    "while efforts were made to ensure goodness of fit for the entire line profile , more emphasis was laid on the linecore ( which is expected to be less impacted by outflow ) .",
    "figure  [ modelcomp ] shows the best - fit model spectra overlaid on the observed spectra for the main and isotopic lines towards the central position of smm4 .",
    "while only the central spectra are shown for each transition , the fits are good through most of the mapped regions .",
    "lc @xmath35 & 0.5 kms@xmath33 + @xmath37 & @xmath38 + r@xmath34 & 0.015 pc + t@xmath34 & @xmath39 yrs + v@xmath40 & 0.75 kms@xmath33 +    the tsc model is a parameterized model , and hence the search space to obtain the best fit model is quite large .",
    "for this reason , observational constraints when available , were used to set the initial value of the infall parameters in the fitting process .",
    "the initial value of the infall radius r@xmath34 was constrained using the ratio of hco@xmath0   j=3@xmath12   main beam temperatures towards the central source obtained from jcmt and hht . as shown in @xcite , it is possible to constrain the emitting source size from the ratio of the main beam temperatures of the same transition obtained at two different telescopes with different beam sizes . at 267 ghz ,",
    "the main beam efficiencies are 0.6 and 0.71 , and beam sizes are 19   and 28   respectively for jcmt and hht , which can be used to obtain the emitting source size of smm4 to be 10.5 .",
    "this size is in very good agreement with the core size derived from molecular emission observed with high angular resolution aperture synthesis observations @xcite . now that r@xmath34 is constrained ,",
    "if the time since onset of collapse t@xmath34 is known , the initial value of the effective sound speed @xmath35 can be determined .",
    "it is now believed that the pure infall phase before the onset of molecular outflows is extremely short - lived or non - existent @xcite .",
    "hence the dynamical time - scale of the observed outflows can be used as a good indicator of t@xmath34 . from the projected ehv lobes in the jcmt",
    "co j=2@xmath11   data shown in figure  [ intco ] and the maximum flow velocity , we derive an outflow dynamical timescale of @xmath41 years , which was used as the initial value of t@xmath34 in the model fits .",
    "the angles subtended by the rotational axis in and out of the plane of the sky are also input parameters to the models .",
    "the angle in the plane of the sky is taken to be @xmath42 ( east of north ) from the appearance of the outflow lobes in figure  [ intco ] .",
    "we initially assumed that the outflow was in the plane of the sky , and the best - fit models are consistent with this interpretation .",
    "the best value of v@xmath40 was chosen from the linewidth of our h@xmath10co@xmath0 observations .",
    "for our model fits we used a temperature distribution profile of @xmath43 k. in the radiative transfer program we used a hco@xmath0to h@xmath3 abundance of @xmath44 and cs to h@xmath3 abundance of @xmath45 . for isotopic ratios , we used [ @xmath6c/@xmath10c ] @xmath46 and [ @xmath12s/@xmath11s ] @xmath47 .    since the fitting is done `` by eye '' , it is difficult to claim that the best fit model is a unique fit to the observed data .",
    "while some model parameters are only loosely constrained , the modeling exercise does set strong constraints on other parameters .",
    "for example , the direction and size of the gradient seen in the centroid velocity maps shown in figure  [ centall ] can only be reproduced in the models , by assuming a rotational axis at an @xmath32   position angle .",
    "assuming a north - south or east - west orientation of the rotational axis results in model centroid velocity maps that have gradients west to east and north to south , not the north - west to south - east sense seen in figure  [ centall ] .",
    "the angle that the rotational axis makes to the plane of the sky is also well constrained .",
    "significant departures from the assumed orientation , viz . , the rotational axis is in the plane of the sky , results in bad fits to the ratio of blue - to - red peaks of the hco@xmath0   lines .",
    "the best fit infall size of @xmath48 pc corresponds to an angular diameter of @xmath49   at the distance of the serpens cloud .",
    "the hco@xmath0   estimated core size ( as discussed above ) is 10 , so this indicates that the expansion wave might have already escaped the densest regions of the core . as seen in figure",
    "[ intco ] , other protostellar sources are located quite close to smm4 . the tsc model is applicable only to isolated collapse resulting in a single protostar .",
    "the values derived above for the infall parameters of smm4 using the tsc model should thus be interpreted with some caution .",
    "if we assume that the constrained infall parameters are not heavily affected by the cluster environment , we can quantify some other physical parameters in the smm4 system .    from table",
    "[ modelfits ] , the infall timescale is given by @xmath50 yrs .",
    "this number is in good agreement with the lower limit to the age of the outflow system derived as @xmath51 yrs in this work ( see above ) , as well as the estimate of @xmath39 years from the co observations of @xcite .",
    "this would indicate that outflow was triggered almost simultaneously with the onset of collapse in smm4 .",
    "the rotational velocity , @xmath52 s@xmath33 implies that the turnover radius @xmath53 pc @xmath54 . from the self - similar solution of shu ( 1977 ) ,",
    "a mass accretion rate of @xmath55 m@xmath56yr@xmath33 is derived .",
    "the present mass of the star - disk system can then be calculated by @xmath57 giving a mass of @xmath58 m@xmath56 , which falls well within the dust mass limits derived by @xcite for smm4 .",
    "the centrifugal radius ( or the accretion disk radius ) of the smm4 system at the present epoch is @xmath59 au .",
    "it is expected that the observed luminosity of @xmath60 l@xmath56@xcite in smm4 is probably dominated by the process of accretion .",
    "if we assume all the observed luminosity arises from accretion onto one star , we can estimate the mass of the star as follows : the bolometric luminosity is given by @xmath61 , where r@xmath62 r@xmath56 , and @xmath63 m@xmath56yr@xmath33 .",
    "this gives @xmath64  m@xmath56 .",
    "since the mass of the star - disk system is @xmath58 m@xmath56 , the mass of the central disk is @xmath65 m@xmath56 .",
    "the maximum value of the disk mass that is stable to m@xmath66 gravitational instability is given by @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "in the case of smm4 , this ratio is 0.67 , which implies that the disk should be gravitationally unstable against collapse or fragmentation . from the above discussion",
    ", it appears that both the cloud core and accretion disk ( if present ) are in a state of dynamical collapse .",
    "the observational identification of dynamical collapse in the early stages of star formation has been a subject of repeated controversy ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) . given the history of the subject , it is natural to worry about whether our identification of collapse in our sources is indeed the only unique conclusion .",
    "below we discuss some alternate models and methods of their elimination .    in identifying the classic asymmetric blue peak signature of an observed line profile with infall , we have to worry about four possible alternatives : ( 1 ) two cloud components along our line of sight , and the blueshifted cloud happens to be stronger ; ( 2 ) a background component that is being absorbed by an unassociated foreground component that happens to be redshifted ; ( 3 ) an outflow source with a stronger blue lobe ; ( 4 ) the blueshifted part of a rotating cloud .",
    "statistically speaking , all four models listed above have a 50% chance of producing the asymmetric blue profile .",
    "the infall scenario has a 100% chance of producing the asymmetric blue signature . in observing a large number of infall candidates ,",
    "the preponderance of blueshifted asymmetry in the central line profiles can be statistically interpreted as identification of infall @xcite .",
    "however , for individual sources , the blue asymmetric line profile alone is not unique evidence for infall .",
    "if we observe a second line that is optically thin , we can start eliminating some of the models mentioned above . in model ( 1 ) , the optically thin line would have two peaks or a single peak aligned in velocity with one of the two cloud components . in model",
    "( 2 ) , the optically thin line should show a single peak aligned in velocity with the background component . on the other hand ,",
    "if the observed optically thin line has a single peak in the absorption dip of main line , this would eliminate both models ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "another effect to study when observing an isotopic line is to use line ratios of main to isotopic transitions , as was done in this work , to derive an optical depth profile .",
    "infall would be expected to produce an asymmetric red profile in optical depth , in addition to an asymmetric blue peak in the line profile . in models ( 3 ) and",
    "( 4 ) we would not expect the red asymmetry a - priori in the optical depth profile .",
    "for instance , a strong blueshifted outflow lobe ( model 3 ) , in the presence of an increasing temperature gradient toward the center of the source , would be expected to have an asymmetric blue optical depth profile as well as an asymmetric blue line profile .",
    "however , to eliminate models ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) convincingly , we need line maps to determine the effect of outflows and rotation .    effects of outflows are not expected to be seen orthogonal to the outflow . for sources , where outflow is in the plane of the sky , its effects are expected to be somewhat reduced .",
    "one way to get around the problem of outflow contamination is to choose molecular species that are not very abundant in outflows .",
    "we have adopted this technique in our study by choosing the hco@xmath0j=3@xmath12   and j=4@xmath13   transitions , which because of their higher critical densities are not expected to be excited in outflows .",
    "detailed study of maps of the hco@xmath0   transition along with high velocity co maps from outflows , as was done in this work , will help us understand the effect of outflows on the identification of the infall signature .",
    "the blue - bulge signature obtained by mapping an optically thick transition naturally takes into account the effect of rotation .",
    "are there other interpretations other than infall when we observe the morphology of the blue - bulge signature ?",
    "outflows can produce a gradient from blueshifted to redshifted velocities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , such a gradient should be in the same direction as the outflow .",
    "the choice of the v@xmath14 of the cloud is somewhat critical in determining the distribution of blueshifted and redshifted velocities in the centroid velocity maps . by obtaining careful observations of an optically thin tracer ( which would show a gaussian profile about the v@xmath14 ) ,",
    "such systematic errors can be reduced . to zeroth order , however , we have found from models and observations that the overall morphology of the gradient and bowing of the velocity contours towards the center of the source is independent of the choice of both the velocity window and the cloud velocity .",
    "when the velocity gradient is orthogonal to the outflow , and the blue - bulge morphology is seen , the simplest explanation is one that involves infall .",
    "smm4 is a prototypical infall candidate in that all three conditions , viz .",
    "the right sense of asymmetry in line profiles ( blue asymmetric ) and optical depth profiles ( red asymmetric ) , and the blue - bulge signature in centroid velocity maps of density sensitive molecules are seen . in summary , convincing evidence for infall in _ individual _ sources requires both mapping and obtaining isotopic transitions . in the case of smm4 ,",
    "the mapping data and isotopic data from density sensitive molecules are consistent with an infall interpretation .",
    "the region around the class 0 protostellar system smm4 in the serpens cloud core has been mapped in several millimeter and submillimeter high density molecular tracers , providing the detection of kinematic infall signatures towards this object .",
    "these observations show both the classic blue - asymmetric line profile signature and the blue - bulge centroid velocity signature of infall .",
    "the main conclusions of this paper are summarized below .    1",
    ".   the line profiles of optically thick main isotopes of hco@xmath0  j=1@xmath10 , j=3@xmath12   and j=4@xmath13 , and cs j=2@xmath11   exhibit the characteristic blue asymmetric line profile signature consistent with infall .",
