    "since the work of thouless and co - workers @xcite , physicists have recognized that the exotic physics encountered in quantum hall systems @xcite , and more recently topological insulator materials @xcite , is intimately tied to the topological properties of their bandstructures .",
    "topological band theory has since been extended in several interesting directions beyond its original context .",
    "for example , several groups have shown that when cold - atom or condensed - matter lattices are subjected to a time - periodic drive , the resulting bloch - floquet states can form topologically non - trivial bands @xcite .",
    "these `` floquet topological insulators '' @xcite exhibit many of the properties expected of topological materials , such as edge states which are immune to disorder - induced backscattering , but they also have some unique and peculiar characteristics of their own ; for example , topologically - protected edge states can exist even when all the bands have zero chern number and would thus normally be considered `` topologically trivial '' @xcite .",
    "topological bandstructures have also been identified in photonic systems , including magneto - optic photonic crystals @xcite , cavity qed circuits@xcite , metamaterial photonic crystals @xcite , and ring resonator lattices @xcite .",
    "interest in these systems is driven , in part , by the possible device applications of topologically - protected photonic modes ( e.g.  the stabilization of slow - light transmission ) , and in part by the fundamental interest of combining topological band physics with optical phenomena ( e.g.  gain and nonlinearity ) .",
    "the literature on topological photonics has intersected in interesting ways with the floquet topological insulator concept : notably , fang _",
    "_  have studied the floquet bandstructures formed by lattices of photonic resonators which are driven periodically ( e.g. ,  by electro - optic modulators ) @xcite , while rechtsman _",
    "_  have experimentally demonstrated a coupled - waveguide array which acts like a floquet topological insulator , with adiabatic wavepacket evolution along a spatially - modulated axis simulating a time - periodic drive @xcite .",
    "we will focus on ring resonator lattices of the sort studied in refs .  .",
    "such photonic topological insulators have the technologically desirable properties of being on - chip , realizable at optical frequencies , and not requiring an external drive or magnetic field . as originally proposed by hafezi _",
    "@xcite , ring resonators are arranged in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) lattice , and coupled weakly by specially - engineered waveguides which produce phase shifts incommensurate with the lattice , analogous to the landau gauge in the quantum hall effect .",
    "subsequently , it was shown that a topological bandstructure could be obtained in a lattice with commensurate couplings @xcite , analogous to the zero - field quantum hall effect @xcite .",
    "the transition into the topologically non - trivial phase occurs by tuning the inter - ring couplings to large values , such that the system must be treated with transfer matrix rather than tight - binding methods .    in this paper",
    ", we point out that these resonator - and - waveguide photonic topological insulators @xcite can be modeled as networks of the sort developed by chalker and coddington in the 1980s to study the anderson transition in quantum hall systems @xcite .",
    "network models are described by discrete - time evolution operators in place of hamiltonians @xcite , and we show that this allows the bloch modes of _ periodic _ networks to be mapped onto the bloch - floquet states of driven lattices@xcite  which , as mentioned above , have attracted a great deal of recent attention @xcite . to date , however , ideas from the network model literature have not been widely employed in the growing floquet topological insulator literature .",
    "furthermore , the network picture allows a topological invariant to be formulated based on adiabatic pumping @xcite , relating the number of topologically - protected edge states in the projected bandstructure to the winding number of a coefficient of reflection from one edge of the network .    in its original context , a chalker - coddington ( cc )",
    "network model @xcite describes a 2d electron gas subject to a strong magnetic field and a disorder potential , @xmath0 , whose correlation length greatly exceeds the magnetic length . in this regime , the electron wavefunctions are localized along equipotential contours of @xmath0 .",
    "the equipotentials form the directed links of a network , and each link is associated with an aharonov - bohm phase acquired by the electron amplitude .",
    "saddle points of the potential , where the quantum tunneling between adjacent contours ( links ) can occur , make up the nodes of the network , which is taken to form a square lattice .",
    "the tunneling between the incoming and outgoing links at each node is described by a unitary scattering matrix , parameterized by a coupling strength @xmath1 .",
    "one can associate to each network a unitary matrix relating the inputs and outputs of the entire ensemble of nodes , which is analogous to a `` discrete - time '' evolution operator @xcite . although the model was originally formulated for studying the effects of disorder , ho and chalker @xcite subsequently applied the evolution operator analysis to a periodic square lattice network , and showed that an effective 2d dirac hamiltonian emerges at the critical value @xmath2 , with chiral edge states appearing when @xmath3 .",
    "this result was later rederived , in the context of photonic topological insulators , in ref .  , together with the bulk and projected bandstructures .",
    "one of the aims of the present paper is to clarify the band topology and the nature of the bulk - edge correspondence in these bandstructures .",
    "we will see that the bandstructures derived in ref .",
    "are characteristic of `` anomalous floquet insulators '' ( afi)@xcite : all bands have zero chern number despite the existence of topologically protected edge states .",
    "we shall also see that network models based on the honeycomb lattice have richer phase diagrams , containing both `` chern insulator '' ( ci ) phases@xcite ( where the bands have non - zero chern number ) and afi phases .",
    "similar behavior has previously been found in a 2d hexagonal tight - binding model with periodically - varying hopping amplitudes@xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that in their original context , network models were intended to be effective descriptions of a system with a definite underlying hamiltonian  a non - interacting electron gas in a magnetic field and disorder potential .",
    "however , the situation is reversed for photonic resonator lattices : here , the wave amplitude description of coupled ring resonators @xcite is valid for arbitrary coupling parameters , and an effective hamiltonian ( tight - binding ) description emerges for weak coupling @xcite .",
