    "similarly , @xmath10 denotes the scaled interval @xmath11 $ ] if @xmath12 and @xmath13 $ ] if @xmath14 .",
    "unfortunately , one of the main limitations of interval arithmetics is that the computed interval enclosures are often much wider than the exact range of the given factorable function .",
    "this overestimation effect is mainly caused by the so called _",

    "an advantage of interval arithmetics is its favorable computational complexity : storing an interval in floating point format amounts to storing two floating point numbers of the same format . in terms of computation time ,",
    "evaluating a product of intervals is about @xmath19-@xmath20 times more expensive than evaluating a product of real numbers .",
    "the above rules for the binary sum and evaluation of the exponential functions are only @xmath21-times more expensive than a corresponding function evaluation with real numbers .",
    "another advantage of interval arithmetics is that the computational and storage complexity of its multivariate extension scales linearly with the number of variables of the factorable function .",
    "this is due to the fact that the complexity of storing an @xmath22-dimensional interval vector @xmath23 is of order @xmath24 .    [",
    "[ convex - set - arithmetics . ] ] convex set arithmetics .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    during the last decades , there have been many attempts to overcome the limitations of interval arithmetics by using more advanced set propagation techniques . here",
    ", one way to generalize interval arithmetics is to replace the intervals ( or interval vectors ) with more general computer representable convex sets .",
    "for example , relaxations propagate convex lower and concave upper bounds rather than standard intervals  @xcite .",
    "arithmetic has the same computational complexity as interval arithmetics with respect to the number of variables @xmath22 , namely @xmath24 . in practice",
    ", it sometimes yields tighter bounds , but it is also slightly more expensive than interval arithmetics despite the fact that it has the same complexity , as illustrated in  @xcite .",
    "another class of convex set based enclosure tools is the so - called ellipsoidal calculus @xcite , where multi - dimensional ellipsoids rather than interval vectors are used in order to represent the set enclosures . in terms of storage requirements ,",
    "@xmath22-dimensional ellipsoids can be represented by a vector in  @xmath25 , representing the center , and a symmetric and positive semi - definite shape matrix in  @xmath26 .",
    "thus , the complexity of storing ellipsoids is of order @xmath27 , while intervals can be stored with complexity  @xmath24 .",
    "unfortunately , the computational complexity of ellipsoidal calculus is typically of order @xmath28 , if dense matrix - matrix multiplications are not avoided . concerning applications in the field of validated integration and control ,",
    "ellipsoidal calculus has been found to be a suitable tool for mitigating the inherent dependency problem of set arithmetics  @xcite .",
    "for example ,",
    "in contrast to interval arithmetics , ellipsoid arithmetics can be used to construct stable validated integration algorithms  @xcite . in this sense",
    ", it has been established that , at least for particular applications , the higher computational effort of storing ellipsoids rather than intervals pays out in terms of the accuracy of the enclosure set .",
    "other convex enclosure methods use polyhedral sets , which are in general even more expensive to store than ellipsoids , but they can be used to represent convex sets with arbitrary precisions by controlling the number of facets .",
    "polyhedral relaxations have become popular in the field of global optimization and are for example used in the software  ` baron `  @xcite , which is based on linear programming relaxations .",
    "another example for an enclosure algorithms based on polyhedral sets is the so - called `` affine arithmetics '' @xcite .",

    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    a rather apparent disadvantage of all convex set based arithmetics is that they can , in the best case , represent the convex hull of the image of a given factorable function .",
    "consequently , if the exact image set of a factorable function is non - convex , the benefit of investing into more accurate convex set representations , such as zonotopes or even general polytopes with many facets , is limited .",
    "one way to overcome this limitation is by working with non - convex sets , which are in practice often represented by using polynomials .",
    "the use of interval polynomials or polynomials with interval remainder terms have been developed since a long time starting in the 1960s  @xcite and 1980s  @xcite .",
    "these early works have been the basis for the popular taylor model arithmetic , which has been developed by berz and coworkers  @xcite .",
    "nowadays , there exist mature tools , for example the software  ` mc++ `  @xcite , implementing taylor model arithmetics with arbitrary order .",
    "the favorable convergence properties of taylor models on variable domains with small diameter have been analyzed thoroughly  @xcite .",
    "however , the convergence properties of taylor series on wider domains are often less favorable .",
    "for example , the taylor series of the function @xmath29 at @xmath30 is divergent outside the interval @xmath18 $ ] , as the analytic continuation of this function has poles at @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "a promising direction towards overcoming this limitation of taylor models is the ongoing research on so - called chebychev models . for functions with one or two variables",
    "chebychev models can be constructed by the software ` chebfun ` as developed by trefethen and coworkers @xcite .",
    "chebychev models for functions with more than two variables are the focus of recent research  @xcite . while computing bounds on convex sets is computationally tractable , finding tight bounds of a multivariate polynomial is itself a complex task . here , one way to compute bounds on such polynomials is to use linear matrix inequalities  @xcite .",
    "other heuristics for computing range bounders for multivariate polynomials can be found in  @xcite .",

    "in fact , also the overestimation of standard taylor models decreases in sections , if the domain @xmath60 is increased , although one might argue that , overall , a rough trend is that the overestimation error of the enclosure methods increases when increasing the domain  @xmath60 .",
    "one aspect that is not shown in the figure  [ fig::result1 ] is that taylor models do outperform interval superposition models on very small domains , i.e. , if we would zoom in and analyze the overestimation for @xmath77 , we could see that taylor models are the better choice on such small domains .",
    "however , as mentioned in previous section , the local convergence properties of the proposed superposition could be improved by constructing , e.g. , superpositions of first order taylor models rather than intervals , but this is not implemented here as the motivation of this paper is to develop a tool that yields reasonable bounds on wider domains . notice that on the domain @xmath63 \\times [ 0,20]$ ] the overestimation of the first order interval superposition method with @xmath71 yields an enclosure that is approximately @xmath78 times larger than the width of the exact range , i.e. , the relative over - approximation is approximately @xmath79 .",
    "this is in contrast to taylor models , which yield bounds that are more than @xmath73 times larger than the exact image set .",

    "moreover , as the above example considers a function with two variables , second or other higher order interval superposition models are equivalent to exhaustive branching , i.e. , this example is not suited for making a fair comparison of such higher order methods .",
    "therefore , we refer to section  [ sec::recursion ] , where first and second order interval superposition models are analyzed for a more challenging case study .      in order to illustrate how the proposed interval superposition arithmetics performs for a more challenging example ,",

    "we define the functions @xmath82 recursively . of course , the function @xmath83 are `` simple '' polynomial functions in principle , but the actual challenge is that the order of these polynomials grows exponentially with @xmath84 .",

    "it can be checked easily that exact image sets satisfy a convergence rate condition of the form @xmath88",

    "all results are shown in dependence on @xmath84 .",
    "notice that the first order interval superposition models yield enclosure sets that are much less conservative than the enclosures that are obtained by standard interval arithmetic , but both enclosure methods are divergent for @xmath93 .",
    "this is in contrast to the second order interval superposition arithmetic , which yields convergent enclosures for @xmath93 .",
    "the results for first and second order taylor models are not shown in the figure , as they perform even worse than standard interval arithmetic for this particular example .",
    "if we use a taylor model of order @xmath19 , the remainder interval is equal to @xmath89 when bounding the @xmath19-th order polynomial @xmath81 .",
    "however , the enclosure set that is obtained by applying a @xmath19-th order taylor model for bounding the function @xmath94 is again worse than the corresponding enclosure obtained by standard interval calculus .",
    "the authors also tried to use a taylor model of order @xmath95 , which does lead to a remainder interval of width @xmath89 when applied to the functions @xmath81 and @xmath94 recalling that @xmath94 is a multivariate polynomial of order @xmath95 .",
    "however , if we apply a taylor of order @xmath95 for bounding the function @xmath96 the overestimation error is again larger than @xmath97 , which corresponds to about the same accuracy that is obtained by applying the much cheaper standard interval calculus .",
    "thus , in summary , taylor models fail to yield reasonable bounds for this example on the particularly wide domain @xmath87 ^ 3 $ ] .",
    "of course , this conclusion changes if the functions @xmath83 are bounded on smaller interval domains , where taylor models tend to yield more accurate enclosures .    because the exact image sets converge linearly and because theorem  [ thm::higherorderlocal ] predicts that the overestimation error of second order interval superpositions converge has the form @xmath98^{3 } \\right ) } \\ ; , \\ ] ] with respect to the diameter of the input set @xmath99 , one would expect that the overestimation error converges cubically for larger input domains @xmath99 and then linearly , once term the linearly convergent term becomes dominant .",
    "the convergence plot of the second order interval superposition models in figure  [ fig::recursion ] indicates indeed such a behavior : for the range @xmath100 the hausdorff distance between the second order interval superposition enclosure and the exact set converges superlinearly , although one might argue that it is hard to tell from these numerical results whether this range corresponds to a cubic convergence phase .",
    "however , for @xmath101 the convergence rate switches and becomes linear , since in this phase the terms with linear convergence order , @xmath102 , dominate recalling that these terms did not dominate early because we chose a rather large number of branches , @xmath92 , in this example .",
    "consequently , the numerical convergence behavior of the second order interval superposition models for @xmath103 can be explained by the theoretical analysis results from theorem  [ thm::higherorderlocal ] .",
    "this paper has introduced an interval superposition arithmetic and illustrated the advantages of this new arithmetic compared to existing enclosure methods for factorable functions on wider domains .",
    "the construction of interval superposition models is based on derivative - free composition rules which exploit global algebraic properties such as rational addition theorems , inverse rational addition theorems , and partially separable sub - structures of the computational graph of factorable functions .",
    "the corresponding technical developments are based on dependency expansions , which can be viewed as a derivative - free , algebraic abstraction of taylor expansions .",
    "interval superposition arithmetic has polynomial run - time and storage complexity of order @xmath104 , which depends on the number @xmath22 of variables of the factorable functions and the branching accuracy @xmath105 .",
    "the order @xmath106 of this polynomial run - time bound is equal to the order of the dependency expansion .",
    "moreover , this paper has established local and global convergence estimates of the proposed arithmetic in dependence on the order @xmath106 of the interval superposition and in dependence on the coupling degree of the given factorable function . from a practical perspective",
    ", the main advantage of interval superposition arithmetics compared to other enclosure methods is that it yields reasonably accurate bounds of the image set of factorable functions on wider interval domains , for which existing methods often yield divergent or very conservative bounds .",
    "this advantage has been illustrated by analyzing two numerical case studies .",
    "many algorithms of current interest such as semi - infinite programming algorithms , validated integrators , as well as branch & bound methods for global optimization rely on the availability of set arithmetics for factorable functions . as interval superposition models have major advantages compared to existing set computation methods on wider domains , this novel arithmetic should be of practical relevance to everyone working on or using such algorithms . moreover , since interval superposition arithmetic is , on the one hand , a bounding tool , but , on the other hand , exploits the concept of coordinate aligned branching while enforcing polynomial run - time and storage requirements , this arithmetic might lead to new types of global optimization algorithms , where the branching and bounding operations are not considered as separate routines anymore . however , a deeper analysis of the corresponding interplay between the presence of global algebraic structures in factorable functions and the complexity of their associated optimization problems is beyond the scope of this paper and shall be part of future research",
