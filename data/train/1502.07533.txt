    "our interest stems from the analysis in dendievel and latouche  @xcite of the erlangization method for markovian fluid models , but the story goes further back in time .",
    "the erlangian approximation method was introduced in asmussen _",
    "@xcite in the context of risk processes ; it was picked up in stanford _",
    "@xcite where a connection is established with fluid queues .",

    "@xcite where some basic algorithms are developed .",
    "markovian fluid models are two - dimensional processes @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a markov process with infinitesimal generator @xmath6 on the state space @xmath7 ; to each state @xmath8 is associated a rate of growth @xmath9 and @xmath10 is controlled by @xmath11 through the equation @xmath12 performance measures of interest include the distributions of @xmath10 and of various first passage times .",
    "usually , @xmath11 is called the phase of the process at time @xmath13 and @xmath10 its level , and the phase space @xmath14 is partitioned into three subsets @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 such that @xmath18 , @xmath19 or @xmath20 if @xmath8 is in @xmath15 , @xmath16 or @xmath17 , respectively . to simplify our presentation without missing any important feature , we assume below that @xmath17 is empty . the first return probabilities of @xmath10 to its initial level @xmath21 play a central role in the analysis of fluid queues .",
    "it is customary to define two matrices @xmath22 and @xmath23 of first return probabilities : @xmath24 ,    \\qquad \\mbox{$i \\in { \\mathcal{s}}_+$ , $ j \\in { \\mathcal{s}}_-$,}\\ ] ] and @xmath25 ,    \\qquad \\mbox{$i \\in { \\mathcal{s}}_-$ , $ j \\in { \\mathcal{s}}_+$,}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the first passage time to level 0 .",
    "thus , the entries of @xmath22 and @xmath27 are the probability of returning to the initial level after having started in the upward , and the downward directions , respectively .",
    "if the process starts from some level @xmath28 , then @xmath29   = ( \\begin{bmatrix } i",

    "a similar equation holds for @xmath38 .",
    "the matrices @xmath22 and @xmath23 are solutions of algebraic riccati equations and their resolution has been the object of much attention .",

    "the erlangian approximation method is introduced in @xcite to determine the detailed distribution of @xmath39 .",
    "the idea is that , to compute the probability @xmath40 , \\qquad \\mbox{$x>0 $ , $ i \\in \\{1 , \\ldots , m\\}$}\\ ] ] for a fixed value @xmath41 , it is convenient to replace @xmath41 by a random variable @xmath42 with an erlang distribution , with parameters @xmath43 for some positive integer @xmath44 .",
    "the random variable @xmath42 has expectation @xmath41 and variance @xmath45 , so that @xmath46 is a good approximation of @xmath47 if @xmath44 is large enough . from a computational point of view",
    ", the advantage is that one replaces systems of integro - differential equations by linear equations .",
    "the long and the short of it is that the original system is replaced by the process @xmath48 with a two - dimensional phase @xmath49 on the state space @xmath50 and with the generator @xmath51 where @xmath52 .",
    "the physical interpretation is that the absorbing state 0 is entered at the random time @xmath42 , and the component @xmath53 of the phase marks the progress of time towards @xmath42 . some authors ( for instance @xcite ) report that good approximations may be obtained with small values of @xmath44 .    because of the toeplitz - like structure of @xmath54 , the matrices @xmath22 and @xmath30 are both upper block - triangular block - toeplitz and it is interesting to use the toeplitz structure in order to reduce the cost when @xmath44 is large .",
    "this is done in @xcite for the matrix @xmath22 . here",
    "we address the question of efficiently computing the exponential matrix @xmath55 for a given value of @xmath56 , where @xmath30 has the structure of .",
    "we shall assume without loss of generality that @xmath57 .",
    "we recall that the exponential function can be extended to a matrix variable by defining @xmath58 for more details on the matrix exponential and more generally on matrix functions we refer the reader to higham  @xcite .",
    "the matrix @xmath59 defined in is of order @xmath60 and it may be huge , since a larger @xmath44 leads to a better erlangian approximation , while the size @xmath61 of the blocks is generally small . the matrix @xmath59 is a subgenerator , i.e. , it has negative diagonal entries , nonnegative off - diagonal entries , and the sum of the entries on each row is nonpositive .    since block - triangular block - toeplitz matrices are closed under matrix multiplication , it follows from that the matrix exponential @xmath62 is also an upper block triangular , block - toeplitz matrix ; in particular , the diagonal blocks of @xmath62 coincide with @xmath63 .",
    "moreover , it is known that the matrix @xmath62 is nonnegative and substochastic .",
    "the problem of the computation of the exponential of a generator has been considered in xue and ye  @xcite and by shao et al .",
    "@xcite , where the authors propose component - wise accurate algorithms for the computation .",
    "these algorithms are efficient for matrices of small size . for the erlangian approximation problem ,",
    "these algorithms are useless for the large size of the matrices involved .",
    "recently , some attention has been given to the computation of the exponential of general toeplitz matrices by using arnoldi method ( lee _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , pang and sun  @xcite ) .    in our framework ,",
    "toeplitz matrices are block - triangular so that they form a matrix algebra .",
    "this property is particularly effective for the design of efficient algorithms and we propose some numerical methods that exploit the block - triangular block - toeplitz structure and the generator properties . unlike the general methods ,",
    "our algorithms allow one to deal with matrices @xmath59 of very large size .",
    "two methods rely on spectral and computational properties of block - circulant and block @xmath64-circulant matrices ( bini  @xcite , bini _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) and on the use of fast fourier transforms ( fft ) .",
    "recall that block @xmath64-circulant matrices have the form @xmath65,\\ ] ] and that a block - circulant matrix is a block @xmath64-circulant matrix with @xmath66 . for simplicity ,",
    "we denote by @xmath67 the block @xmath68-circulant matrix @xmath69 .",
    "since block @xmath64-circulant matrices can be block - diagonalized by fft @xcite , the computation of the exponential of an @xmath70 block @xmath64-circulant matrix with @xmath3 blocks can be reduced to the computation of @xmath44 exponentials of @xmath3 matrices .",
    "these latter exponentials are independent from each other and can be computed simultaneously with a multi - core architecture at the cost of a single exponential .",
    "the idea of the first method is to approximate @xmath62 by @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 is sufficiently small .",
    "we analyse the error and are thereby able to choose the value of @xmath64 which gives a good balance between the roundoff error and the approximation error .",
    "in fact , the approximation error grows as @xmath74 while the roundoff error is @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the machine precision .",
    "this leads to an overall error which is @xmath77 . by using the fact that the solution is real , by choosing @xmath64 a pure imaginary number we get an approximation error @xmath78 which leads to an overall error @xmath79 .",
    "since the approximation error is a power series in @xmath64 , we devise a further technique which consists in averaging the solutions computed with @xmath80 different values of @xmath64 .",
    "this way , we are able to cancel out the components of the error of degree less than @xmath81 .",
    "this leads to a substantial improvement of the precision .",
    "moreover , since the different computations are independent from each other , the computational cost in a multicore architecture is independent of @xmath80 .    in our second approach , the matrix @xmath59 is embedded into a @xmath82 block - circulant matrix @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is sufficiently large , and an approximation of @xmath85 is obtained from a suitable submatrix of @xmath86 .",
    "the computation of @xmath86 is reduced to the computation of @xmath84 exponentials of @xmath3 matrices , and our error analysis allows one to choose the value of @xmath84 so as to guarantee a given error bound in the computed approximation .",
    "the third numerical method consists in specializing the shifting and taylor series method of @xcite .",
    "the block - triangular toeplitz structure is exploited in the fft - based matrix multiplications involved in the algorithm , leading to a reduction of the computational cost .",
    "the algorithm obtained in this case does not seem well suited for an implementation in a multicore architecture .",
    "we compare the three numerical methods , from a theoretical as well as from a numerical point of view . from our analysis , we conclude that the method based on @xmath64-circulant matrices is the fastest and provides a reasonable approximation to the solution .",
    "moreover , by applying the averaging technique we can dramatically improve the accuracy .",
    "the method based on embedding and the one based on power series perform an accurate computation but are slightly more expensive .",
    "it must be emphasised that the use of fft makes the algorithms norm - wise stable but that component - wise stability is not guaranteed . in consequence , the matrix elements with values of modulus below the machine precision may not be well approximated in terms of relative error .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in sections",
    "[ sec : der ] and [ sec : fastcomp ] , we recall properties of the exponential of a subgenerator and of its derivatives , and some basic properties of block - toeplitz and block - circulant matrices which are used in our algorithms . in section [ sec : expcirc ] , we show how to compute the exponential of a block @xmath64-circulant matrix by using fast arithmetic based on fft and we perform an error analysis .",
    "we present in section [ sec : exptt ] the algorithms to compute the exponential of @xmath59 : first we analyse the decay of off - diagonal entries of the matrix exponential , next we describe the new methods and perform an error analysis .",
    "we conclude with numerical experiments in section [ sec : exper ] .",
    "a subgenerator of a markov process is a matrix @xmath54 of real numbers such that the off  diagonal entries of @xmath54 are nonnegative , the diagonal entries are negative , and the sum of the entries on each row is nonpositive .",
    "we denote by @xmath87 the column vector with all entries equal to 1 , with size according to the context .",

    "then @xmath588    the scaling and squaring method is used to accelerate the convergence of the taylor series , by using the property that @xmath589 indeed , if @xmath590 is an estimate of @xmath591 , and if @xmath592 , then @xmath593 and the truncated taylor series expansion is used to approximate @xmath594 . since @xmath595 is block - triangular block - toeplitz , then @xmath596 .",
    "the toeplitz structure is used in the computation of the taylor expansion and in the squaring procedure .",
    "in fact , the computation of each term in the power series expansion consists in performing products between block - triangular block - toeplitz matrices , that can be done by applying algorithm [ alg:2 ] in view of remark [ rem : tt ] ; similarly in the squaring procedure at the end of the algorithm .",
    "concerning rounding errors , we observe that the taylor polynomial is the sum of nonnegative terms .",
    "therefore no cancellation error is encountered in this summation .",
    "the main source of rounding errors is the computation of the powers @xmath597 for @xmath598 which are computed by means of algorithm [ alg:2 ] in view of remark [ rem : tt ] relying on fft .",
    "we omit the error analysis of this computation , which is standard . however , we recall that in view of theorem [ th : fft ] , fft is normwise backward stable but not component - wise stable . for this reason , for the truncation of the power series",
    "it is convenient to replace the component - wise bound expressed by theorem [ thm : trtay ] by the norm - wise bound @xmath599 from which we obtain that the condition @xmath600 implies that @xmath601 .",
    "the overall procedure is stated in algorithm [ alg : ttt ] .",
    "it is worth pointing out that , if the computation of the powers of the triangular toeplitz matrices is performed with the standard algorithm then the computation is component - wise stable as shown in @xcite .    set @xmath379    set @xmath602 , @xmath603 , @xmath604 , @xmath130    compute @xmath590 an estimate of @xmath605 , or set @xmath606    compute @xmath592 and @xmath607    set @xmath608 and @xmath237 , @xmath609 , @xmath580 , @xmath130 .",
    "the numerical experiments have been performed in matlab . to compute the error obtained with the proposed algorithms",
    "we have first computed the exponential by using the ` vpa ` arithmetic of the symbolic toolbox with 40 digits and we have considered this approximation as the exact value .",
    "denote by @xmath611 , @xmath612 , the approximations of the blocks on the first row of @xmath62 and define the four errors @xmath613\\|_\\infty,\\\\ & \\textrm{nw - rel}=\\|[a_0-\\tilde a_0,\\ldots , a_{n-1}-\\tilde a_{n-1}]\\|_\\infty/\\|[a_0,\\ldots , a_{n-1}]\\|_\\infty,\\\\ \\end{split}\\ ] ] which represent absolute / relative component - wise and norm - wise errors , respectively .      the test matrix @xmath59 is taken from two real world problems concerning the erlangian approximation of a markovian fluid queue @xcite .",
    "the block - size @xmath44 of @xmath59 is usually very large since a bigger @xmath44 leads to a better erlangian approximation , while the size @xmath61 of the blocks is equal to 2 for both problems .",
    "we show the performances in terms of accuracy of the algorithm based on the @xmath64-circulant matrix . in table",
    "[ tab:1 ] we report the errors generated by algorithm [ alg : ttepsc ] with @xmath614 applied to the first problem .",
    "observe that the errors are much smaller in magnitude than @xmath73 .",
    "the component - wise and norm - wise absolute errors range around @xmath615 , while the componentwise relative errors deteriorate as @xmath44 increases ; the norm - wise relative errors moderately increase as @xmath44 increases .",
    "this behavior is expected since the use of fft makes the algorithm stable in norm , while the component - wise accuracy is not guaranteed .",
    "concerning the second problem , we report only the results in the case where scaling is applied .",
    "in fact , there is not much differences between the sclaed and the unscaled versions since this problem is already well scaled in its original formulation . in figure",
    "[ fig : prob2.1 ] we report the errors for the method based on @xmath64-circulant matrices .",
    "it is interesting to note that the optimal value of @xmath73 is close to 1 and that the component - wise relative error is minimized by values of @xmath73 greater than 1 .",
    "this fact , which apparently seems to be a contradiction , is explained as follows .",
    "large values of @xmath64 generate large errors in the lower triangular part , i.e. , the lower triangula part of @xmath616 has large norm .",
    "on the other hand we consider the first block - row of @xmath71 to approximate the matrix exponential of @xmath59 , therefore the errors are not influenced by a large error in the lower triangular part .      to conclude , the method based on @xmath64-circulant is the fastest one , but the accuracy of the results is lower than that provided by the embedding and taylor series expansion .",
    "however , by applying the averaging technique we can dramatically improve the accuracy of the @xmath64-circulant algorithm .",
    "the algorithms based on embedding , on @xmath64-circulant matrices are faster than the one based on taylor series with fft matrix arithmetic .",
    "moreover they are better suited for a parallel implementation .",
