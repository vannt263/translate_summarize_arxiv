    "the ferromagnetic annulus can create vortices in the superconductor and form a bound system of fa - sv , provided that the @xmath7-component of the annulus magnetic field exceedes the matching field for creating a vortex .",
    "our calculations showed that the vortex trapped or created under the annulus may have one or more flux quanta depending on the ratio @xmath74 which can be controlled easily either by changing the thicknesses of the films or by decreasing the density of the superconducting carriers . in the superconducting phase near the transition temperature the ratio @xmath74 becomes very large , creating a giant vortex above the annulus .",
