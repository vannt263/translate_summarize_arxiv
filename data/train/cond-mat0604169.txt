    "the insertion of a hard wall in such a fluid decreases the number of hard - sphere configurations .",
    "the system can increase its entropy by the spontaneous formation of crystalline layers with triangular symmetry , the ( 111 ) plane , at the wall , while the bulk is still a fluid @xcite .",
    "this effect is known as prefreezing , and is analogous to complete wetting by fluids at solid substrates .",
    "it is induced by the presence of a single wall and should not be confused with capillary freezing .",
    "capillary freezing denotes the phenomenon of confinement induced freezing of the whole fluid in the pore at thermodynamic state points where the bulk is still a fluid .",
    "this transition depends strongly on the plate separation . the opposite phenomenon , called capillary melting",

    "recently cohen @xcite studied configurations of confined hard spheres under shear , demonstrating the importance of the equilibrium configurations in the rheological properties . despite the great number of theoretical and simulation studies on confined hard spheres @xcite , the full _ equilibrium _ phase behavior is yet unknown .",
    "in fact , many of the previous studies were based on an order parameter analysis , which fails dramatically in discriminating the different structures at high densities and large plate separations . more importantly ,",
    "free energy calculations of confined hard spheres are prohibited so far due to the lack of an efficient thermodynamic integration path which relates the free energy of interest to that of a reference system , while a further complication arises from the enormous number of possible solid phases that has to be considered .",
