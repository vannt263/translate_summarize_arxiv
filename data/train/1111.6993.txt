    "the present - day massive galaxy population is dominated by objects with early - type morphologies ( e.g. baldry et al .",
    "2004 , conselice et al . 2006 ) . however , it is still unknown whether this was also the case at earlier cosmic epochs .",
    "addressing this question is key in our understanding of the physical processes that drive galaxy evolution , as galaxy morphology is directly linked to the evolutionary paths followed by these objects .",
    "in fact , a profound morphological transformation of the massive galaxy population is expected within the currently most favoured galaxy formation scenario , the hierarchical model . for massive galaxies",
    "this model predicts a rapid formation phase at 2@xmath1z@xmath16 dominated by a dissipational in - situ star formation fed by cold flows ( oser et al .",
    "2010 ; dekel et al .",
    "2009 ; keres et al . 2005 ) and/or gas rich mergers ( ricciardelli et al . 2010 ; wuyts et al . 2010 ; bournaud et al .",
    "2011 ) . at the end of this phase ,",
    "massive galaxies are expected to be more flattened and disk - like than their lower redshift massive counterparts ( naab et al .",
    "2009 ) . after this monolithic - like formation phase , massive galaxies",
    "are predicted to suffer a period of intense bombardment by minor satellites ( khochfar & silk 2006 ; hopkins et al . 2009 ; feldmann et al .",
    "2010 ; oser et al .",
    "2010 ; quilis & trujillo 2012 ) that may eventually transform the original disk - like population into the predominant present - day spheroid - like population .",
    "although the above scenario is very suggestive of a deep morphological transformation of the massive galaxy population , there is no compelling observational evidence supporting this idea .",
    "however , some recent works suggests that this could be the case ( e.g. oesch et al .",

    "this transformation is difficult from the observational point of view due to the scarce number of massive galaxies at high - z .",
    "however , the advent of wide area and deep near infrared surveys ( e.g. dickinson et al .",
    "2003 , scoville et al .",
    "2007 , conselice et al .",
    "2011 ) have opened up the possibility of exploring a large number of these galaxies up to high redshifts . in this paper",
    "we address , to the best of our knowledge for the first time , the issue of the morphological transformation of massive galaxies using a statistical representative sample of nearly @xmath21000 galaxies with @xmath0 obtained from the sdss dr7 ( z@xmath20 ; abazajian et al .",

    "we have already conducted a morphological quantitative analysis of the above galaxies in previous papers ( trujillo et al .",
    "2007 ; buitrago et al . 2008 ) where we have provided clear evidence for a significant size evolution for these objects since z@xmath23 . however , a visual classification of these galaxies and an analysis of their overall profile shape have been missing . in this paper",
    "we take advantage of the combined power of the visual and quantitative morphological analysis to explore how the morphologies of the massive galaxy population has changed with redshift .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : section [ sec : data ] is devoted to the data description and its analysis , section [ sec : results ] presents our main results , section [ sec : change ] details the evolution with redshift of the various morphological classes and in section [ sec : discussion ] we discuss the implications of our findings . at the end of this work",
    "we include an appendix containing the simulations we have performed to test the accuracy of our structural parameter determination in the gns .",

    "ideally we would also like to study all of our galaxies at a similar restframe wavelength range .",
    "this is the reason behind our choice of working with several different surveys .",
    "the imaging for the local universe galaxy reference sample was obtained using the sdss dr7 ( abazajian et al .",

    "795 massive galaxies were used , with 421 of them possessing spectroscopic redshifts ( from davis et al .",
    "there were 35 more massive galaxies in the parent sample , but they were excluded as they are identified as agn and hence they may skew our results .",
    "when spectroscopic information was not available , photometric redshifts were calculated for the bright galaxies ( @xmath26 ) using the annz code ( collister & lahav 2004 ) and bpz ( bentez 2000 ) for the rest .",

    "the same exercise was also performed with charlot & bruzual ( 2007 ; private communication ) models , inferring slightly smaller masses ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "combining the total uncertainties with those of the photometric redshifts , errors in the masses could be as high as @xmath34 for @xmath35 galaxies ( trujillo et al .",
    "the sample of massive galaxies selected from this survey constitutes the largest sample of hst observed massive galaxies in this redshift range published to date .      the gns total sample consist of 80 massive galaxies .",
    "we used spectroscopic redshifts ( 11 ) when available ( barger et al .",
    "2008 , popesso et al .",
    "photometric redshifts and masses take advantage of the extensive goods fields wavelength coverage ( bvriizjhk ) , and were obtained using standard multicolor stellar population fitting techniques ( buitrago et al .",

    "stellar masses errors are typically 0.2 - 0.3 dex .",
    "spectroscopic redshifts agree well ( @xmath36 ) with photometric determinations ( buitrago et al .",
    "2008 ) . as our observations are probing the optical restframe ( or bluer than this ) ,",
    "possible effects by tp - agb stars are minimized .",
    "this sample is the largest massive galaxies compendium ( 80 objects ) at @xmath37 imaged with hst we are aware of .",
    "one of the aims of the present work is selecting a sample with the largest number of spectroscopic redshifts as possible .",
    "this is extremely challenging at @xmath38 , even for objects as luminous as massive ( m@xmath39 ) galaxies , see for example cimatti et al .",
    "their spectral features become very difficult to detect , specially when reaching the redshift desert , i.e. , when the [ oii ] emission line surpasses the 1 @xmath40 wavelength limit of optical spectrographs . consequently , at @xmath41 two thirds of our sample posses spectroscopic redshifts , while at higher redshift the number of detections drop to just 10 in powir / deep2 and 11 in gns .",
    "this fact implies that the redshift bins above @xmath42 are affected largely by these redshift uncertainties .",
    "however , given the quality of our hst photometry and the width of our redshift bins we argue that this has not a crucial impact in our final results .",
    "once we selected the final sample of objects , the surface brightness distributions of all our galaxies were fit to a single srsic ( 1968 ) model convolved with the psf of the images .",
    "the srsic model has the following analytical form :    @xmath43 \\right\\}\\ ] ]    where @xmath44 is the intensity at the effective radius , and a@xmath45 is the effective radius along the semimajor axis enclosing half of the flux from the model light profile .",
    "the quantity @xmath46 is a function of the radial shape parameter @xmath47 ( called the srsic index ) , which defines the global curvature of the luminosity profile , and is obtained by solving the expression @xmath48 , where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are , respectively , the gamma function and the incomplete gamma function .",
    "the sizes we provide are circularized , @xmath51 , with @xmath52 the projected ellipticity of the galaxy .",
    "we first estimated the apparent magnitudes and sizes of our galaxies using sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) , which were then fed as initial conditions to the galfit code ( peng et al .",
    "galfit convolves srsic r@xmath53 2d models with the psf of the images and determines the best fit by comparing the convolved model with the observed galaxy surface brightness distribution using a levenberg - marquardt algorithm to minimise the @xmath54 of the fit .    before we carried out our fitting we masked neighbouring galaxies , following the idea explained in huler et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and barden et al . (",
    "2012 ) . in the case of very close galaxies with overlapping isophotes ,",
    "objects were fit simultaneously . due to the point - to - point variation of the shape of the camera psf in our images we chose several ( non - saturated ) bright stars to gauge the accuracy of our parameter estimations .",
    "the final values for the structural parameters of every galaxy are the mean of these independent runs ( one per each star used as psf ) .",
    "the catalogs are published as part of trujillo et al .",
    "( 2007 ; powir / deep2 sample ) and conselice et al .",
    "( 2011 ; gns sample ) .    in relation to the sdss imaging , although the nyu catalog already provides structural parameters obtained using one dimensional srsic fits to the galaxies , for the sake of consistency with our methodology , we ran again galfit on the sdss images of these galaxies to obtain structural parameters .",
    "it is known that the nyu catalog has a systematic underestimation of the srsic index , effective radius and total flux , as it is reported in the simulations performed in blanton et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and in the appendix of guo et al .",
    "our findings agree with this fact , as we find an offset of @xmath55 for the circularised effective radius values of our galaxies and another @xmath56 for the srsic indices .",
    "we performed simulations to assess the reliability of our quantitative results at high redshift .",
    "our purpose was two - folded : correcting our structural parameters for a more accurate representation of their values and exploring in an unbiased way whether we are missing any region in the parameter space of the massive galaxy properties . in case of the powir / deep2 sample the simulations are fully explained in trujillo et al .",
    "they created 1000 artificial galaxies with random structural properties within the observed ranges of the sample . in that study no significant trend in either the sizes or the concentration of the galaxies",
    "was found ( see their fig .",
    "3 ) , except for an underestimation of @xmath57 in the srsic index of the very faint @xmath58 spheroid - like galaxies .",
    "we carried out a similar analysis in appendix a for the galaxies in the gns sample .",
    "for the present paper , we went a step further in the complexity of our simulations , not only in the number of objects ( @xmath1316 ) but specially in finely sampling the small sizes regime ( @xmath59 arcsec ) which is key to understanding the compact massive galaxy population .    here",
    "we offer a brief description of our simulations .",
    "we created 16000 mock galaxies employing the idl routines developed for huler et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , randomizing both the galaxy positions in our imaging and the galaxy structural parameters .",
    "once the output of our simulations in the parameters space ( @xmath60 ) was recovered , we estimated the difference with the intrinsic ( input ) values .",
    "the most important outcome is that , on average , the srsic indices of our observed gns massive galaxies grow by @xmath210% when corrections based on the simulations are applied .",
    "however , the individual values per galaxy depend on its exact position in the 3d space defined by the apparent magnitude , srsic index and effective radius .    in general , we found that for objects with disk - like surface brightness profiles ( i.e n@xmath61@xmath12.5 ) , both sizes and srsic indices are recovered with basically no bias down to our limiting explored h - band magnitude .",
    "however , by increasing the input srsic index we found biases in the determination of the sizes and @xmath47 .",
    "for example , a galaxy with n@xmath61@xmath24 and h=22.5 mag ( our median magnitude within the gns catalogue ) , the output effective radii are @xmath33 smaller and output srsic indices are @xmath62 smaller than the input values .",
    "the results of these simulations , however , show that the decrease in the srsic index we observe from z@xmath22.5 to z=0 for the spheroid - like population ( which is around a factor of @xmath22 ) can not be fully explained as a result of the bias on recovering the srsic index .",
    "in addition to the quantitative morphological analysis explained above , visual morphological classifications were derived for all the galaxies in our sample . to assure a high reliability in our results , two authors of this paper ( fb and it , with checks by cc ) classified visually all the galaxies in an independent way .",
    "we divided our sample according to the hubble classification scheme into spheroid - like objects ( e+s0 or early - type ) , disk - like objects ( s or late - type ) and peculiar galaxies ( either irregular galaxies or ongoing mergers ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : montage ] we show some examples of our classification scheme at different redshifts .",
    "very conspicuous bulge systems were identified as early - type objects .",
    "both e and s0 galaxies are hence included together in the same morphological class .",
    "we avoid segregating between e and s0 since , at high - z , it is a difficult task to distinguish between these two types of galaxies , and we prefer to remove this potential source of error . spiral or late - type morphologies are detected by a central brightness condensation located at the centre of a thin disk containing more or less visible spiral arms of enhanced luminosity .",
    "lastly we joined irregular ( unsymmetrical ) galaxies and mergers in the same class , again to avoid any missclassification at high - z where the differences between these types are more difficult to interpret .",
    "it is not straightforward to asses the robustness of our visual classifications as this is a pattern recognition problem and as such can not be addressed by standard algorithm procedures . nevertheless , at z@xmath20",
    ", we can compare our results with other alternatives coming from independent studies .",
    "first , we compare our results with the sdss bayesian automated morphological classification by huertas - company et al .",
    "there are 190 out of our 207 galaxies in common where we can make a direct comparison .",
    "they applied support vector machine techniques ( huertas - company et al .",
    "2008 ) to associate a probability to each galaxy being e , s0 , sab or scd . for those galaxies where",
    "they have assigned a probability larger than 90% of pertaining to a given class , their neural network agrees with our visual classification for 89% of the early - types and 68% of the late - types .",
    "moreover , all our sdss local galaxies have been visually classified within the galaxy zoo project ( lintott et al .",
    "we find that 112 out of the 121 galaxies that we classified as early - type are classified as ellipticals by galaxy zoo ( i.e. @xmath293% ) . for spiral galaxies we get 48 out of 62 ( i.e. @xmath277% ) .",
    "the discrepancies in our late - type galaxies identifications arise from the difficulty to interpret s0 galaxies without the astronomer s `` trained - eye '' intervention and , as stated previously , they are included as early - type objects throughout our study .",
    "consequently , our local classification seems to be robust .",
    "we acknowledge , however , that at higher redshifts visual morphological classification is more controversial for several reasons .",
    "first , the cosmological surface brightness dimming may affect the recognition of fainter galactic features and second , the angular resolution is poorer at higher redshift .",
    "nonetheless , the first effect is compensated by the increase of the intrinsic surface brightness ( e.g. marchesini et al .",
    "2007 ; prescott , baldry & james 2009 , cirasuolo et al .",
    "2010 ) of the galaxies due to having a higher star formation rate in the past , and the fact that their stellar populations are younger . in relation to the angular resolution , at z=0.03 ,",
    "one arcsec is equivalent to @xmath20.6 kpc , whereas at 1@xmath1z@xmath13 it is @xmath28.0 kpc .",
    "fortunately , the higher resolution imaging used for exploring the morphologies of our high - z galaxies ( fhwm@xmath20.1 - 0.3 arcsec ) compared to the local ones ( fwhm@xmath21.0 - 1.5 arcsec ) alleviates this problem , although in general , a smoother surface brightness distribution due to the worse resolution is expected .",
    "all these effects combined imply that at higher redshifts there would be a larger number of featureless objects that visually would be confused with early - type galaxies .",
    "we will show in the next section that this is the opposite of what we find , ultimately giving stronger support to the results of this paper .",
    "another source of uncertainty comes from the objects catalogued as peculiar class .",
    "this classification could be seen as a miscellaneous box where we included galaxies which do not fulfill neither early - type nor late - type descriptions .",
    "furthermore , their photometry may be compromised by means of their multiple components . for the sake of clarity , we include here the number of irregular massive galaxies in our redshift bins ( see table [ tab : structural_data ] ) which is 2/0/11/27/14/8 , while for mergers are 5/8/31/31/16/13 .",
    "the aim of this paper is not to constrain the nature of this peculiar class , and due to the multiple nature of some of their members their results are only tentative .    finally , we must bear in mind that dust obscuration may alter galaxy observables depending on the geometry .",
    "its main effect is usually an artificial size increment and srsic index lowering due to the fact that central concentrations of dust flatten the flux profile from the observed galaxy ( trujillo et al .",
    "in reality , the real contribution depends on the amount of dust and its distribution within the galaxies at study ( see mollnhoff , popescu & tuffs 2006 , where the authors also present corrections for disks scalelenghts and central surface brightnesses )",
    ". however , both trujillo et al . ( 2007 ) ( see their figure 4 and section 4.2 ) and buitrago et al . ( 2008 ) ( see their section 4 ) reported only small changes in the structural parameters when comparing acs and nicmos observations .",
    "we shall come back to this issue in more detail in our next section .",
    "the k - correction effect is another potential source of error both within the quantitative and visual morphological classification .",
    "we have selected our filters at each survey to minimise this effect , and to observe the galaxies as close as possible to the optical restframe . nonetheless , our classification at 1.3@xmath63z@xmath632 could be compromised by using f814w as this filter is tracing the uv restframe of our targets .",
    "we explored how relevant this effect is by analysing the properties of 24 galaxies with z@xmath12 in our powir / deep2 sample which also have h - band nicmos imaging . in trujillo",
    "et al . ( 2007 ) we discussed the size difference between the optical and near - infrared for these galaxies ( their fig .",
    "4 ) . we did not find a systematic bias , but a scatter of 32% . with regards to the srsic index , we found an offset of @xmath64 towards larger indices in the h - band .",
    "the difference in the visual morphology between the i and the h - bands shows that 19 galaxies ( @xmath65 ) have the same morphology in the two filters , while only 5 ( @xmath66 ) are catalogued differently .",
    "our errors for visual classifications are represented by the standard deviations for a binomial distribution .",
    "we found in acs 13 ( @xmath67 ) early - type galaxies ( 10 in nicmos , @xmath68 ) , 6 ( @xmath69 ) late - type galaxies ( 10 in nicmos , @xmath68 ) and 5 ( @xmath66 ) peculiar galaxies ( 4 in nicmos , @xmath70 ) .",
    "in addition to this analysis of galaxies in the egs , we compared the difference between the i and h band morphologies for those galaxies in the gns with 1.7@xmath1z@xmath12 ( which is the redshift interval where our powir / deep2 and gns sample overlap ) .",
    "we used the i - band acs imaging of the goods fields ( giavalisco et al .",
    "postage stamp images for 20 common galaxies were retrieved from the rainbow database ( barro et al .",
    "our galfit analysis showed that the effective radius and the srsic index are recovered without any significant offset , but with a large scatter as in the aforementioned trujillo et al .",
    "( 2007 ) . regarding their visual morphologies",
    ", we found that 6 galaxies ( @xmath71 ) were not possible to classify reliably due to the few pixels that compose their image , most probably due to dust obscuration ( buitrago et al .",
    "2008 , bauer et al .",
    "2011 ) . for the remaining 14 galaxies , 11 ( @xmath72 )",
    "have the same visual morphology , while for 3 galaxies ( @xmath73 ) there is a difference . for the detections in the acs camera , 4 ( @xmath74 ) are early - types ( 6 for their nicmos counterparts , @xmath75 ) , 6 ( @xmath76 ) are late - types ( 5 in nicmos , @xmath77 ) and 4 ( @xmath74 ) are peculiars ( 3 in nicmos , @xmath78 ) .",
    "there are a number of studies which have explored the k - correction issue for massive galaxies .",
    "toft et al .",
    "( 2007 ) analyzed a sample of 41 galaxies with masses greater than @xmath79 at @xmath80 having nicmos and acs imaging as well .",
    "they reported that half of their distant red galaxies where marginally detected or even disappeared in restframe uv bands .",
    "in contrast , cassata et al . (",
    "2011 ) reported a weak k - correction within their 563 similar - mass passive galaxies comparing acs and wfc3 observations .",
    "our sample is not as high redshift as toft et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , it is more massive on average and in addition we deal a variety of massive galaxies instead of red and passive galaxies as in cassata et al .",
    "summarising , k - correction undoubtedly plays a role , which is hard to delimite in our sample .",
    "nevertheless , our tests help us undertanding that visual morphologies appear to be robust against these changes .",
    "finally , we can conduct a further test to quantify the robustness of our visual classification , namely to explore the axis ratio distribution of our objects .",
    "the axis ratio distribution of local disk galaxies has a mean value of @xmath20.5 ( ryden 2004 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the axis ratio distribution of the nearby e / s0 population is known to peak at around 0.7 - 0.8 ( ryden , forbes & terlevich et al . 2001 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : hist_ar ] displays the distributions of axis ratios in our sample according to our visual morphological determinations . we also overplot the median values from our samples ( dashed line ) and the axis ratio distribution using only our local sample ( dotted line ) . in table",
    "[ tab : structural_data ] we also show the mean axis ratio for our different galaxy populations .",
    "we find that the objects that are visually classified as early - type galaxies have a typical axis ratio of @xmath20.7 ( independent of their redshift ) .",
    "also , for galaxies visually classified as disks , the axis ratio is independent of the redshift with an average b / a@xmath20.55 .",
    "both values are in good agreement with the expectation from the local universe .",
    "this test reinforces the idea that our visual classifications are accurate .",
    "the evolution of galaxy morphology with redshift can be addressed in two different ways : quantitative ( exploring how their structural parameters have changed with time ) , and qualitative ( probing how the visual appearance has evolved with redshift ) . in the local universe , the structural properties of massive galaxies ( mainly its light concentration ) can be linked with their appearance . in particular , as a first approximation one can identify disk or late - type galaxies with those galaxies having lower values of the srsic index ( n@xmath21 ; freeman 1970 ) and early - type galaxies with those having a profile resembling a de vaucouleurs ( 1949 ) shape ( n@xmath24 ) . this crude segregation based on the srsic index",
    "was shown to work reasonably well by ravindranath et al .",

    "table [ tab : structural_data ] lists the mean values of the structural parameters from the galaxies in our sample , splitting them among a number of redshift ranges and their visual morphologies .",
    "concerning effective radius measurements , we retrieve again the reported size decrease for massive galaxies with redshift .",
    "as explained in section [ subsec : axis_ratios ] , axis ratios values per morphological class are independent of redshift , which agree with our morphological classifications .",
    "finally , there is a tendency for the srsic indices ( observed using both mean and median values , see fig .",
    "[ fig : mean_vs_median ] ) to become progressively smaller at increasingly higher redshifts .",
    "moreover , there is a separation in the average sersic index for late and early - type massive galaxies at all redshifts . due to the number of photometric redshifts we used",
    ", it is interesting to know whether all these statistical tendencies are preserved if only taken into account the results for galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts .",
