    "the solution of the sa gives a magnetic structure where spins are preferably arranged antiferromagnetically along the @xmath11 axis and ferromagnetically within a given @xmath25 plane .",

    "the reduced ordered moment even at 1.5  k ( t / t@xmath74 @xmath134 0.036 ) suggests the presence of quantum fluctuations due to the quasi-1d magnetic interactions .",
    "however , all magnetic peaks are found to be instrumental resolution limited suggesting 3d long - range afm order at 1.5  k.    both the magnetization and neutron diffraction studies reveal that the two iso - structural compounds srco@xmath1v@xmath1o@xmath2 and srmn@xmath1v@xmath1o@xmath2 have different magnetic ground states . unlike srmn@xmath1v@xmath1o@xmath2",
    ", the magnetic structure of srco@xmath1v@xmath1o@xmath2 , which consists of a ferro-/antiferromagnetic arrangement of afm chains within the tetragonal plane ( @xmath25 plane ) is unusual for a tetragonal structure .",
    "two explanations for this situation may be considered as ( i ) the presence of competing interchain interactions along the diagonal ( @xmath135 ) direction within the @xmath25 plane and/or ( ii ) a structural transition from the tetragonal to an orthorhombic symmetry which accompanies the magnetic ordering .    for the former case , the competition between afm @xmath136 ( along the principle axes @xmath48 and @xmath51 ) and afm @xmath137 ( along the diagonal direction in the @xmath25 plane ) results in magnetic frustration for a square - lattice ( tetragonal symmetry ) . for a frustrated square - lattice system ,",

    "the collinear stripe structure is occurred by an order by disorder phenomenon.@xcite however , it should be noted that the spin - geometry within a given @xmath25 plane for the studied compounds is more complex [ fig .",
    "[ fig : crysstruc](c ) ] than a simple square - lattice .",
    "furthermore , the dominant interaction is the intrachain afm interaction which is expected to be an order of magnitude greater than the interchain interactions .",
    "moreover , the crystal structure suggests the possibility of a complex interchain interaction topology with many competing interactions ; not only within the @xmath25 plane but also with an out - of - plane component .",
    "the screw chains also may allow second - nearest - neighbor intrachain interactions along the @xmath11 axis . to investigate the interchain interactions in detail , inelastic neutron scattering studies on single crystal sample",
    "are required .",
    "the reduction of the magnetic symmetry can also be explained by a finite magnetoelastic coupling within the @xmath25 plane . in this case , the effective @xmath136 interactions along two principle axes become unequal due to lattice distortions .",
    "however , the lattice distortions , if any , are rather weak and , therefore , not evident in the present neutron diffraction data which has moderate resolution .",
    "note that , neither the sign nor the magnitude of the change of @xmath136 as a function of distance are known . to search for a possible distortion ,",
    "high resolution diffraction studies as a function of temperature by using either neutron or synchrotron radiation are desired .      in order to understand further the nature of magnetic orderings ,",

    "the integrated intensities were obtained from gaussian function fit of the magnetic satellite peaks . the fits",
    "confirm that the positions of the magnetic peaks do not change with temperature proving that there is no change of the @xmath3-vectors for both compounds .",
    "the intensity of each magnetic peak was normalized with respect to its intensity at the base temperature 1.5  k. these measurements allowed us to determine the critical exponent @xmath92 for the temperature induced phase transition from the long - range afm ordered state to the paramagnetic state .",
    "the order parameter ( i.e. , the ordered afm moment _ m _ ) can be expressed as @xmath140 .",
    "the ordered magnetic moment is proportional to the square root of the integrated intensity of the magnetic peaks .",
    "thus the critical exponent @xmath92 can be obtained by fitting the square root of the integrated intensity to the following equation @xmath141 where _ a _ is a proportionality constant and @xmath5 is the 3d afm ordering temperature . for srco@xmath1v@xmath1o@xmath2 ,",

    "the fitted values of @xmath92 and @xmath5 are found to be 0.33 @xmath63 0.03 and 5.21 @xmath63 0.03  k , respectively .",
    "the fitted value of @xmath92 = 0.33 is close to the value @xmath143 @xmath144 predicted for the 3d ising model .",
    "@xcite the slightly higher value of @xmath92 may be due to the deviation from the pure ising limit as evident in our temperature - dependent susceptibility study .",

    "[ fig : criti - expt](b ) ] .",
    "the fitted value of @xmath92 agrees well with the theoretically expected value of 0.367 for the 3d heisenberg model.@xcite      now , we focus on the nature of the magnetic correlations above and around @xmath5 . the magnetic patterns at 20 , 15 , 10 , 6 , 5 , and 4  k for srco@xmath1v@xmath1o@xmath2 and at 150 , 100 , 75 , 60 , 50 , 45 , 40 , and 30  k for srmn@xmath1v@xmath1o@xmath2 are shown in figs .",

    "the presence of diffuse magnetic scattering due to short - range spin - spin correlations is evident over a wide temperature range above and below @xmath5 .",
    "this is in agreement with the @xmath40(t ) study where broad peaks , indicating the short - range spin - spin correlations , appeared centered at @xmath4 30  k for the co - compound and at @xmath4 170  k for the mn - compound , respectively [ fig .",

    "the peak intensity increases continuously . at @xmath147 6  k",
    ", an additional broad peak appears at @xmath148  @xmath32 .",
    "when the temperature is lowered further , the broad peaks gradually transform into a set of bragg peaks below @xmath149  k. the complete transformation occurs at @xmath4 4  k resulting in a coexistence of both broad diffuse peaks and sharp bragg peaks over the temperature range 5.24  k. for the mn - compound , with decreasing temperature below 150  k a broad diffuse peak appears at @xmath150  @xmath32 . with",
    "further lowering of temperature , the peak intensity increases continuously and gradually transforms into bragg peaks below @xmath151  k. the broad diffuse peak is found to coexist below @xmath5 down to @xmath4 30  k.    from this diffuse scattering study , it is evident that the transition from short - range to long - range magnetic ordering is not sharp but rather occurs gradually over a wide temperature range in both compounds .",
    "the short - range spin - spin correlations are expected to be one dimensional ( due to the strong intrachain interactions ) and appear when the interaction strength becomes comparable to the thermal energy . with further lowering of temperature ,",
    "the thermal energy becomes comparable to the interchain interaction strength and 3d long - range magnetic ordering starts to occur at @xmath5 . to investigate the exact nature of the short - range correlations , neutron diffraction studies on single crystal are required",

    "the simulated annealing ( sa ) analysis was performed using the fullprof program suite@xcite to verify the magnetic structures obtained from the representation analyses .",
    "this is a very general method to determine the magnetic structure .",
    "it uses an adaption of the metropolis algorithm ( a monte carlo method ) to generate sample states of a thermodynamic system .",
    "it does not depend on the initial parameters and is therefore ideal for solving complex and/or completely unknown structures . in detail",
