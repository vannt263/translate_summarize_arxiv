    "the considerable successes of top quark physics have entered into the field of precision measurements with the operation of large hadron collider ( lhc ) . due to the large mass , close to the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking , the top quark is expected to be the most sensitive to new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) . in the sm , the top quark ( @xmath5)-bottom quark ( @xmath6)-@xmath0 boson interaction vertex is defined by the strength @xmath7 in which the coupling @xmath8 reduces to the quark mixing element @xmath9 at tree level . corrections to this coupling , as well as non - zero anomalous couplings @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 can be generated by the new physics .",
    "the direct constraints on the anomalous @xmath3 couplings , using the cross section measurement provided by cms @xcite and atlas @xcite for t- channel single top quark production and measurement of decay asymmetries of top quark by atlas @xcite , are given in the region ( -0.55 , 0.65 ) for @xmath13 ( 0.55 , 1.55 ) for @xmath14 ( -0.70 , 0.25 ) for @xmath12 and ( -0.60 , 0.55 ) for @xmath11 @xcite .",

    "the indirect constraint from @xmath20 data by cleo is @xmath21 at @xmath22 level @xcite . from @xmath23 mixings and rare @xmath24 decay observables",
    ", it is apparent that indirect constraints are more restrictive than direct constraints for some of the anomalous couplings @xcite .",
    "extensive studies on the anomalous @xmath3 couplings described by a model independent effective lagrangian approach have been performed in the literature through single and pair production of top quarks at hadron colliders @xcite at lepton colliders @xcite and at @xmath25 colliders @xcite .",
    "a high energy electron - proton collider @xcite can be realised by accelerating electrons in a linear accelerator ( linac ) to 60 - 140 gev and colliding them with the 7 tev protons circulating at the lhc .",
    "when the electron beam is accelerated by a linac , it can be converted into a beam of high energy real photons , by backscattering off laser photons .",
    "the spectrum of high energy photons would be about 80% of the energy of the initial electrons .",
    "it has the advantage of obtaining a 80 - 90% polarized electron beam and an intensive high energy photons .",
