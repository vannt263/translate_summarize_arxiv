    "ever since the seminal work by matsui and satz@xcite that the @xmath5 suppression in heavy ion collisions could serve as a signature for the formation of the quark - gluon plasma , a great deal of works have been devoted to the subject@xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the question of whether the charmonium states disappears at @xmath4 or at higher temperature is still controversial up to this date@xcite . while it is generally accepted that @xmath5 is composed dominantly of @xmath6 quark pair interacting within a non relativistic confining potential at zero temperature , it is not clear what effective potential should be used to analyze the property at finite temperature@xcite .",
    "a robust non - perturbative method to calculate the properties of charmonium at zero temperature is based on the qcd sum rule approach@xcite .",
    "the method has been found to work well in reproducing the masses of the ground state charmonium states , the electromagnetic decay width of the @xmath5 , and even the mass difference between @xmath0 and @xmath5 even before experiment . in a constituent quark model ,",
    "the mass difference between the @xmath0 and @xmath5 is due to the color - spin interaction , which phenomenologically is inversely proportional to the masses of the quark and antiquark .",
    "however , it is well known that a naive generalization of the formula fitted to the light quark system and the light heavy quark system underestimates the mass splittings between heavy - heavy quark systems by a factor of 4  @xcite .",
    "the fact that qcd sum rule fits the mass difference indicates that the method captures well the detailed non - perturbative effects involved in the masses of the charmonium states .",
    "therefore , if one is able to systematically investigate the temperature modification of the operator product expansion ( ope ) starting from the vacuum , one can hope to learn about the modification as well as the disappearance of the charmonium states above the critical temperature .    in a previous set of works@xcite",
    ", it was shown that one can indeed study the gradual change of the ope at finite temperature as well as the abrupt change near @xmath4 .",
    "this was due to the fact that the temperature dependence of dimension 4 operators , the gluon condensate , and the twist-2 gluon operator that newly appears at finite temperature , could be well extracted from the lattice calculation of the energy density and pressure at finite temperature .",
    "on the other hand , when the temperature dependencies of the ope were used in the charmonium sum rules , it was found to break down at @xmath7 for the @xmath5 and at @xmath8 for the @xmath9-wave states , respectively  @xcite .",
    "it is not clear if the breakdown of the sum rules is due to the melting of the charmonium states or the breakdown of the ope . to shed light into the problem",
    ", we have recently studied the effect of including the dimension 6 operators to the moment sum rules for @xmath5 at finite temperature .",
    "it was found that their contribution indeed improved the stability to slightly higher temperature@xcite . in this work ,",
    "we calculate the wilson coefficients of dimension 6 gluon operators with spin indices in the two point correlation function of the heavy scalar , pseudoscalar , and axialvector currents .",
    "our result completes the list of all wilson coefficients of gluon operators up to dimension 6 for heavy quark currents without derivatives .",
    "we then use the result to investigate the stability of both the moment and borel qcd sum rule result for the @xmath0 , @xmath5 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 mesons near @xmath4 .",
    "while the inclusion of the dimension 6 operators increases the stability , the sum rules for all currents break down slightly above @xmath4 with that for the @xmath5 persisting to relatively highest temperature .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we give a summary of the independent dimension 6 gluon operators .",
    "section iii shows the calculation for the wilson coefficients of gluon operator with spin indices up to dimension 6 for each currents . in section iv",
    ", we discuss the temperature dependence and the stability for the moment and borel sum rules for charmonium states near @xmath4 .",
    "section iv is devoted to the summary and a possible interpretation of our result .",
    "we list moments and borel transformed wilson coefficients in appendix a and b respectively .",
    "appendix c summarizes the forms for the continuum contribution .",
    "here , we summarize the different representations of the dimension 4 and dimension 6 operators with spin 0 and spin 2  @xcite .      there are two independent gluon operators at dimension 4 .",
    "they can be represented as scalar and spin 2 operators as follows@xcite .",
    "@xmath10 where @xmath11 means symmetric and traceless indices and @xmath12 is the medium four vector taken specifically to take the form in this work .",
    "these two independent operators can be recast into the color electric and magnetic condensates as follows .",
    "@xmath13 using the energy momentum tensor , one obtains the temperature dependencies of these operators from the lattice measurement of the energy density @xmath14 and pressure @xmath15 in pure gauge theory  @xcite .",
    "@xmath16 the temperature dependence in full qcd is expected to be not so different from that obtained in pure gauge theory  @xcite .",
    "there are two independent scalar operators , one of which vanishes in pure gauge theory when the equation of motion is used  @xcite .",
    "the spin 2 gluon operators were categorized@xcite and their anomalous dimensions were calculated recently@xcite . in purge gauge theory , only one gluon operators survive .",
    "using covariant derivatives acting on the gluon condensates , the spin 0 and spin 2 gluon operators are @xmath17 introducing a simplified notation @xmath18 , one can express the spin 0 and 2 operators as follows : @xmath19 in the pure gauge theory where @xmath20 .",
    "we can again express these operators in terms color electric and color magnetic fields .",
    "@xmath21 where we have abbreviated the triple scalar product in color space @xmath22 as abc for simplicity .",
    "while the temperature dependence of the dimension 6 gluon operators can be calculated from the lattice using folded wilson loops in the future , we will assume their temperature dependence from the following approximation .",
    "@xmath23 where the normalization factor @xmath24 is used to reproduce the vacuum value .",
    "we start from the following two point correlation function for the scalar(s ) , pseudoscalar(p ) , vector(v ) , and axialvector(a ) currents ( @xmath25 ) and classify it according to spin and dimension of operators which occur in the ope .",
