    "thermoelectric materials , capable of creating electricity from waste heat are ideal in the search for sustainable energy resources .",
    "the bulk of present day efficient thermoelectric materials have one common feature : all are heavily doped narrow band gap semiconductors with a carrier concentration of 10@xmath7 to 10@xmath8 @xmath9 .",
    "in particular , narrow band gap materials with complex crystal structure have been shown to possess excellent thermoelectric properties.@xcite in general , the efficiency of a thermoelectric material is measured by a dimensionless parameter called the figure of merit , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the thermopower ( seebeck coefficient ) of the material , @xmath12 is temperature , @xmath13 is the electrical conductivity , @xmath14 is the electronic part of the thermal conductivity and @xmath15 is the lattice ( phonon ) contribution to the thermal conductivity .",
    "a @xmath3 value larger than 1 is imperative for successful applications .",
    "since all the material - related parameters that determine @xmath3 are interlinked , tuning each parameter quasi - independently without adversely affecting the other is a tricky endeavor .",
    "many of the binary compounds formed by transition - metal atoms with group iii , iv and v elements have been shown to possess electronic band gaps .",
    "for example , fesi , fesb@xmath16 and fega@xmath0 are all semiconducting with energy gaps of about 0.06 ev , 0.04 ev and 0.45 ev respectively.@xcite the hybridization of the narrow @xmath17 bands of the transition metals with the rather broad @xmath6 bands of the @xmath6-elements has been suggested to assist the formation of such band gaps.@xcite in particular , such hybridization also produces sharp features close to the fermi level , which in turn has been shown to be quite beneficial for enhanced thermoelectric properties.@xcite consequently , large thermopower values of + 500 @xmath18v / k at 50 k in fesi,@xcite -45 mv / k at 10 k in fesb@xmath16,@xcite and -350 @xmath18v / k at 300 k in fega@xmath0@xcite have been evidenced .",
    "the compound ruin@xmath0 is isotypic to fega@xmath0 and was first reported@xcite in 1959 and later confirmed by holleck and co - workers@xcite in 1964 .",
    "early resistivity measurements reported poor metallic conductivity in this system,@xcite but later , density functional theory based calculations predicted semiconducting behavior.@xcite subsequent measurements have confirmed the semiconducting nature of ruin@xmath0.@xcite studies on the thermoelectric properties of ruin@xmath0 do not exist .",
    "recently , we reported the results of the transport measurements of both ruin@xmath0 and its substitution variants ruin@xmath1 ( @xmath2 = sn , zn).@xcite the substitution variants exhibit relatively large seebeck coefficients in a wide temperature range along with reduced thermal conductivity compared to the parent semiconductor ruin@xmath0 , thereby incorporating them in the family of potential thermoelectric materials .",
    "transport measurements on the binary ruin@xmath0 show semiconducting behavior with a band gap of @xmath19 0.45 ev for polycrystalline samples.@xcite the binary compound shows multi - band features exhibiting a large negative thermopower s = -363 @xmath18v / k at 308 k and a positive thermopower s = + 262 @xmath18v / k at 461 k.@xcite this crossover behavior ( electron transport at 308 k to hole transport at 461 k ) is suppressed by chemical substitution .",
    "the sn - substituted samples show @xmath20-type behavior , while the zn - substituted samples show @xmath6-type behavior , with a transition from semiconducting to metallic behavior with increasing @xmath21 .",
    "chemical substitution reduces the thermal conductivity to 50% of the value of the binary compound , resulting in a @xmath3 of 0.45 at 630 k for ruin@xmath22zn@xmath23 ; an improvement by a factor of 7 over pure binary phase .",
    "the wide chemical versatility of this material , combined with the observance of good thermoelectric properties , suggests that further investigations are necessary to optimize and tune this material and identify similar versatile members ( abundant and low - cost alternatives ) as viable candidates for future high - temperature thermoelectric applications .    here ,",
    "firstly we present our results on the electronic and transport properties of ruin@xmath0 and the substitution variants using density functional theory ( dft ) based calculations to provide a microscopic insight into the physics behind the measured phenomenon .",
    "the three theoretical reports on the parent compound that exist in literature have mainly focussed on evaluating the band structure to obtain an estimate for the band gap .",
    "@xcite in the present work , we focus on investigating the changes to the electronic structure as a function of substitution , as well as to probe the dependence of thermoelectric transport properties on the carrier concentration based on first - principles calculations . by doping a semiconductor ,",
    "one creates a slightly different material and the changes induced by doping manifest themselves as a tranformation of the band structure and , correspondingly , the electronic density of sates .",
    "various physical mechanisms , including electron - electron interaction , impurity - band widening , band tailing , and screening effects between the dopant and the host structure play a role in the altering of the band structure.@xcite additionally , the dopant can either be randomly distributed or enter the host structure in an ordered fashion .",
    "these varied scenarios can have a profound effect on the electronic structure of the substituted variants , and the resulting band structure could either be a simple rigid - band shift of the semiconducting host compound to account for the additional holes / electrons or a complex scenario with unequal band shifts of the intrinsic band edges .",
    "tuning thermoelectric properties of the parent semiconductor by doping , requires a well controlled change in the density of states of the doped variants , thereby accessing the sharp peak - like features close to the fermi level of the host material .",
    "consequently , it necessitates a careful study of the electronic structure of both the doped and un - doped compounds first and the subsequent calculation of the transport properties . in our work",
    ", we follow this two - step approach for ruin@xmath1 ( @xmath2 = sn , zn ) .    in our previous work , we observed small amounts of a zno impurity phase and non - reacted elemental ru in the ruin@xmath4zn@xmath5 samples.@xcite the presence of these impurity phases may result in the somewhat non - uniform behavior of the resistivity and thermopower values ( as a function of @xmath21 ) for ruin@xmath4zn@xmath5 in the temperature range 300k @xmath24 @xmath12 @xmath25 600k . on the contrary , thermopower of the sn - substituted samples reduced uniformly with increasing @xmath21 .",
    "based on our calculations of the transport properties of these materials ( section v ) , we infer that the thermopower of both @xmath20- and @xmath6-doped systems should show a uniform behaviour .",
    "consequently , we have successfully prepared a new batch of zno free ruin@xmath4zn@xmath5 ( @xmath21 = 0.025 , 0.050 and 0.100 ) applying starting materials of higher purity and measured their transport properties .",
    "subsequent to the initial refinement of the crystal structure of ruin@xmath0 within the space group @xmath26 ( coga@xmath0 type ) , it has been shown that the this compound crystallizes in the higher symmetry of the tetragonal space group @xmath27 ( no .",
    "136 ) , and belongs to the fega@xmath0 type of structure.@xcite the lattice parameters used in our calculations are @xmath28 = 6.999 and @xmath29 = 7.246.@xcite the unit cell of ruin@xmath0 contains four formula units , with two crystallographically inequivalent in sites , in1 and in2 ( ru : [ 0.3451 , 0.3451 , 0 ] ; in1 : [ 0 , 0.5 , 0 ] ; in2 : [ 0.1555 , 0.1555 , 0.2622]).@xcite the structure of ruin@xmath0 can be visualized using two basic building blocks in a complementary fashion :",
    "( i ) each in1 atom sits in the center of a distorted cube formed by eight in2 atoms ( fig.[str ] , top panel ) ; ( ii ) around each ru atom six neighboring in2 atoms form a distorted trigonal prism , with two trigonal prisms sharing a common face . additionally , the trigonal prisms are interlinked along the crystallographic @xmath30 direction by sharing in2 corners ( fig.[str ] , bottom panel ) .",
    "both building blocks share side faces and form a complex three - dimensional packing of polyhedra , rather than a layered one .",
    "non - spin - polarized dft total energy and kohn - sham band - structure calculations were performed applying the full - potential local - orbital code ( version fplo9.01.35 ) , within the local density approximation ( lda).@xcite the perdew and wang flavor@xcite of the exchange correlation potential was chosen for the scalar relativistic calculations.@xcite the calculations were carefully converged with respect to the number of @xmath31 points , and finally a 24@xmath3224@xmath3224 regular @xmath31-point mesh ( 1183 points in the irreducible brillouin zone ( bz ) ) was used in the full bz . the lattice parameters for undoped ruin@xmath0 and as well as the doped variants@xcite are taken from ref .. it is well known that lda tends to overbind , resulting in lattice constants that are too small .",
    "therefore , the calculations were carried out with experimental lattice constants , while the internal coordinates are relaxed for all the structures considered in this work .",
    "the substitutional derivatives ruin@xmath4sn@xmath5 and ruin@xmath4zn@xmath5 were modeled using three kinds of approaches : the simpler virtual crystal approximation ( vca ) , the fully disordered coherent potential approximation ( cpa , calculated using fplo5.00)@xcite , and the ordered supercell ( sc ) approach .",
    "within vca , a virtual atom with the desired number of electrons and protons is substituted at the indium wyckoff positions .",
    "we employed the vca in the following way : the input of our full potential method are the nuclear positions and charges and the basis functions ( local orbitals ) .",
    "a virtual atom is constructed such that the number of effective valence electrons equals the one in the disordered alloy approximated by vca .",
    "this is achieved by choosing an appropriate non - integer nuclear charge and a corresponding equal number of electrons for the disordered sites .",
    "the full potential scheme then solves the dft equations for this unit cell with non - integer nuclear / electron charges , automatically adapting the basis functions and the potential to this nuclear configuration as it does for any other arrangement of `` natural '' atoms .",
    "this choice of vca reproduces the correct electron filling and often gives very satisfactory results compared to supercell and/or cpa calculations.@xcite in cpa , the disorder of the dopant is taken into account explicitly and hence more reliable , but also more time consuming . within cpa",
    ", the dopant atom retains its identity , but produces an effective medium that accounts for random disorder , resulting in the incoherence of the bands or more precisely , the spectral function @xmath2(@xmath31,@xmath33 ) .",
    "the incoherence arises because of the quantum mechanical averaging of the wavefunctions over the atomic potentials . in the sc approach ,",
    "one of the indium position is occupied by the substituent zn or sn .",
    "such a construction results in ordering of the substituent , but allows one to quantify specific effects that arise because of the periodicity that is imposed .",
    "two supercells were constructed .",
    "the first was constructed by substitution of one in by zn(sn ) within the tetragonal @xmath27 structure unit cell of ruin@xmath0 .",
    "since one unit cell contains four formula units , this corresponds to 8.33% zn(sn ) substitution and has no zn - zn(sn - sn ) nearest - neighbor pairs .",
    "the second cell is a doubled cell along the @xmath29 axis with 8 formula units per unit cell .",
    "again , one in was replaced by zn(sn ) , corresponding to 4.2% zn(sn ) substitution . like the smaller supercell , this cell also has no nearest - neighbor zn - zn(sn - sn ) bonds .",
    "the transport properties were calculated using the semiclassical boltzmann transport theory@xcite within the constant scattering approximation as implemented in boltztrap.@xcite this approximation is based on the assumption that the scattering time @xmath34 determining the electrical conductivity does not vary strongly with energy on the scale of @xmath35 .",
    "additionally , no further assumptions are made on the dependence of @xmath34 due to strong doping and temperature .",
    "this method has been successfully applied to many narrow band gap materials including clathrates and as well as to oxides.@xcite",
    "collected in fig.[bands ] are the lda non - spin - polarized band structure and density of states ( dos ) of the tetragonal ruin@xmath0 . in the energy range displayed ( -3.5 ev to 2 ev )",
    "there is a strong hybridization between the in 5@xmath6 states and the ru 4@xmath17 states .",
    "we obtain a band gap value of 0.3ev , consistent with previously published results.@xcite it is well known that the kohn - sham bands obtained from contemporary exchange correlation approximations underestimate the size of the semiconducting band gaps , hence the calculated band gap of 0.3ev is naturally slightly smaller than the experimentally observed value of 0.45ev.@xcite from the band structure , we witness that ruin@xmath0 has an indirect band gap with the top of the valence band occurring close to the a point along the r@xmath36a symmetry line and the bottom of the conduction band is close to the z point along the @xmath37 @xmath36z line .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that the curvature of these two bands are similarly parabolic , resulting in similar values for the effective masses for the holes and electrons at low substitution concentrations .",
    "our results concerning the bottom of the conduction band are consistent with the reports of imai and co - workers@xcite and with that of mani and co - workers.@xcite on the contrary , calculations by bogdanov _",
    "et al._@xcite using the tb - lmto - asa ( tight binding - linearized muffin tin orbital - atomic sphere approximation ) package find the rather flat band along m@xmath38 as the minimum of the conduction band thereby yielding a larger effective mass of the holes as compared to electrons .",
    "additionally , the bands are similarly dispersive along the various high symmetry directions , consistent with the three dimensional nature of the building blocks in the crystal structure .",
    "our calculations are well in agreement with the recent experimental results on ruin@xmath0.@xcite      the consequences of substituting sn ( group iv ) for in predicted by the three calculational approaches are displayed in fig.[sndoping ] .",
    "the top panel compares the total dos for the various approaches for the 4.2% substitution scenario ruin@xmath39sn@xmath40 .",
    "compared to in , sn has one additional electron and acts as an electron donor in the substitution variant . for easy comparison , the dos of the parent compound is also included in the figure .",
    "ruin@xmath39sn@xmath40 is metallic compared to the parent compound which is semiconducting ( see fig.[bands ] ) .",
    "the shape of the dos close to the fermi edge is quite similar between vca , cpa and the sc approach for ruin@xmath39sn@xmath40 .",
    "the slight dissimilarity in the dos away from the fermi edge arise from the underlying differences in the methodologies .",
    "explicit inclusion ( as compared to vca ) of the sn atom with the more extended 5@xmath6 orbitals in the ordered sc approach results in a larger band width of the ru 4@xmath17 - in 5@xmath6 - sn 5@xmath6 hybridized states .",
    "this is clearly discernible in the dos below -0.3 ev . similarly , disorder induced incoherence of the valence band is also noticed for the cpa derived dos below -0.3 ev . as mentioned previously ,",
    "there are two crystallographically inequivalent indium positions in this structure ( in1 at @xmath41 and in2 at @xmath42 ) . hence , for each sc , two different calculations were performed by placing the substituent sn once at the @xmath41 position and once at the @xmath42 position .",
    "the sn atom preferentially occupies the 8@xmath43 ( in2 ) position , which is energetically favorable by 20 mev per formula unit compared to the 4@xmath29 ( in1 ) position .",
    "the bottom panel of fig.[sndoping ] shows the non - magnetic band structure of ruin@xmath39sn@xmath40 obtained using the sc approach . for a 4.2% substitution",
    ", the original unit cell of the binary compound has been doubled along the @xmath30 axis , resulting in a smaller brillouin zone ( bz ) .",
    "this has two consequences , firstly there are twice the number of bands and secondly all the bands are folded back into the small bz of the sc .",
    "the resulting band picture gets quite complicated and hard to discern meaningful information from it . to facilitate easy comparison with the band structure of the binary compound",
    ", we have unfolded the bands according to the translational symmetry of the original unit cell using the approach described in refs .. the ru and in character unfolded bands of the sc in fig.[sndoping ] are comparable to the bands in fig.[bands ] , though most of the degeneracies are lifted due to the presence of the sn substituent .",
    "the size of the symbols in the band structure plot refers to the @xmath31-resolved weight of all the orbitals of the chosen site .",
    "the larger the size of the symbol , the larger is the contribution of the site to the band structure .",
    "based on this , we can conclude that the bands crossing the fermi level have both in and sn character , comprehensible due to the fact that sn acts as an electron donor , making the system metallic and is only one atomic number away from in in the periodic table , and hence similar to in .    comparing the dos of the binary ruin@xmath0 with that of ruin@xmath39sn@xmath40",
    ", we observe a rather rigid - band - like shift in the electronic structure .",
    "similar behavior is observed for other substitution concentrations ( not shown here ) .",
    "this result is extremely interesting from a technological point of view .",
    "mahan and sofo@xcite showed that a narrow distribution of the energy of the electrons participating in the transport process is needed to maximize thermoelectric efficiency .",
    "the binary ruin@xmath0 possesses sharp peak - like features close to the conduction band minimum and as well as near the valence band maximum .",
    "electron doping , as shown here using sn as a substituent , results in a rigid - band shift of the dos without adversely affecting the sharp peak - like features , thereby opening the possibility of fine - tuning the substitution to achieve maximum thermoelectric efficiency .",
    "this will be discussed in detail in section v.      following the same steps as described above for the sn substitution , we have calculated the electronic structure of the zn substituted system as well . collected in fig.[zndoping ] are the dos and unfolded band structure for the 4.2% substitution scenario ruin@xmath39zn@xmath40 .",
    "substitution of zn introduces holes into the system making ruin@xmath39zn@xmath40 metallic compared to the binary ruin@xmath0 .",
    "similar to the observations in the electron doped system , the dos close to the fermi edge in the hole doped variant is comparable between vca , cpa and the sc approach .",
    "moreover , the 3@xmath17 orbitals of zn are less extended and fully filled , resulting in a strong in character of the bands that cross the fermi level . nevertheless , the changes in the dos close to the fermi level are still rigid - band like , beneficial in tuning transport properties .",
    "contrary to the sn doping scenario , zn atoms desirably occupy the 4@xmath29 ( in1 ) position which is energetically favorable by 27 mev per formula unit compared to the 8@xmath43 ( in2 ) position .",
    "this difference in preferred site occupations between the two substituents can be construed as follows : in2 atoms form a distorted trigonal prism with a ru atom at its center ( refer fig.[str ] ) .",
    "extended @xmath6 orbitals of the anions are necessary to facilitate the hybridization with the narrow @xmath17 bands of the transition metal cations at the center of the distorted trigonal prism .",
    "hence , sn atoms which possess extended and partially filled @xmath6 orbitals preferentially occupy the in2 position .",
    "contrariwise , the transition metal zn atom lacks extended @xmath6-like orbitals and hence preferentially occupies the in1 position , which is at the center of a distorted cube made of 8 neighboring in2 atoms .",
    "our theoretical observation of preferential site occupation for the zn atom is consistent with the experimental observation in another isotypic system coin@xmath4zn@xmath5.@xcite using x - ray diffraction and neutron powder diffraction experiments , the authors observed that the substitution of in by zn takes place in an ordered fashion , producing colored variants of the parent compound coin@xmath0 with the zn atom entering exclusively the position corresponding to the cube centers .    at this juncture",
    ", it should be noted that the proclivity of the substituent to certain indium sites is discerned only from the differences in the total energies of the various supercell configurations .",
    "no strongly distinguishable relevant features are noticeable in the dos plots when sn(zn ) occupy either in1 or in2 position and a similar rigid - band like shift of the dos compared to the binary ruin@xmath0 is noticed for all considered configurations .",
    "this observation is relevant for the experiments , where the fine tuning of the doped samples can be performed without the fear of adversely affecting the electronic structure of the final compound .",
    "additionally , the metallic radii of in and sn are similar ( @xmath191.60 ) and hence size effects do not play a significant role for the electron doped systems . on the other hand ,",
    "the metallic radius of zn is about 13% smaller ( @xmath191.40 ) than that of in and hence zn is incorporated easily as a substitute for in in ruin@xmath0 .",
    "owing to the smaller metallic radius of the dopant zn , there is a likelihood for local structural relaxation around the dopant which could have a detrimental effect on the thermoelectric transport by altering the electronic properties of the host .",
    "we have investigated this in detail , by allowing for the local relaxation around the zn atom in ruin@xmath4zn@xmath5 with @xmath21 = 0.125 .",
    "in the un - relaxed structure , the zn atom ( occupying the in1 position ) is surrounded by a distorted cube of in2 atoms ( see fig.[str ] ) with four in2 neighbors at 3.16 and another four in2 neighbors at 3.26 .",
    "the ru - zn bond length is 2.65 .",
    "the structural relaxation reduces the zn - in2 bond length by just 2% , while the ru - zn bond length on the other hand is slightly increased to 2.70 .",
    "nevertheless , these changes did not alter the electronic structure significantly , likely since the trigonal prisms centered around ru and the cubes centered around in1 site are heavily distorted , already in the undoped system .",
    "having an improved understanding of the electronic properties of ruin@xmath1 ( @xmath2 = sn , zn ) systems , we now calculate the transport coefficients using the semi - classical boltzmann theory and the rigid - band approach . such a procedure has been shown to successfully predict optimal doping levels in other thermoelectric materials , for example clathrates@xcite and sb@xmath16te@xmath0.@xcite one main concern when calculating transport coefficients , is the underestimation of band gaps using the standard dft functionals .",
    "such an underestimation of band gaps manifests in the reduction of thermopower at higher temperatures due to bipolar conduction . to overcome this problem ,",
    "we concentrate on analyzing the trend in the calculated thermopower for various concentrations of electron and hole doping rather than quantifying them .",
    "this approach results in a consistent scenario between experiment and theory as shown below .",
    "firstly , as seen in fig.[bands ] , it is important to note that the valence and conduction band of the stoichiometric compound are parabolic . as shown above , both sn and zn substitution act in a rigid - band like fashion .",
    "therefore , for small amounts of substituents , the bands will continue to remain parabolic .",
    "hence , experimentally the transport can be modeled using simple parabolic band expressions to obtain the concentration of charge carriers in the system .",
    "we also notice that close to the conduction band minimum , there are multiple heavy bands ( _ i.e. _ bands with less dispersion and hence larger effective mass ) , which is advantageous for thermoelectric transport . in contrast , the valence band maximum has a larger energy difference to the next available heavy band . consequently , from just the view point of electronic structure ,",
    "an @xmath20-type material would retain better thermoelectric transport coefficients than a @xmath6-type for low doping concentrations and low temperatures .",
    "the values of the calculated thermopower are not affected by the constant scattering time approximation used to calculate the various transport properties , since the expression for @xmath11 is independent of @xmath34 .",
    "this means that @xmath11 is directly dependent on the electronic structure of the material .",
    "collected in fig.[seebeck ] is the temperature dependence of thermopower for various substitution concentrations of zn and sn in ruin@xmath0 .",
    "sn substitution introduces additional electrons into the system resulting in negative values of thermopower .",
    "correspondingly , we obtain positive values of thermopower for zn substitution which introduces holes in the system . due to the lack of hall data on all the measured samples , the assignment of the substitution concentration for the plots here",
    "are done by comparing the experimental thermopower measurements with the calculated values . for all substitution concentrations considered here ,",
    "the magnitude of @xmath11 increases steeply with temperature until 300 k. above 300 k , in ruin@xmath4sn@xmath5 @xmath44 slightly reduces or remains constant . on the other hand , for ruin@xmath4zn@xmath5 @xmath44 above 300 k",
    "continues to increase with a smaller slope .",
    "below room temperature and for @xmath21 @xmath24 0.050 , @xmath44 for the electron doped system is 1.5 times that of the hole doped system , consistent with the electronic band structure .",
    "in contrast , with increased doping ( @xmath45 0.050 ) and temperatures ( t @xmath46 300 k ) , hole doped ruin@xmath4zn@xmath5 shows increased thermopower compared to the electron doped ruin@xmath4sn@xmath5 .",
    "the maximum values of @xmath11(larger than 200 @xmath18v / k ) are obtained for the smallest doping concentrations in both @xmath6- and @xmath20-type .",
    "our results , including the absolute values of @xmath11 , as well as the trend upon increased doping for the @xmath20-type , are consistent with the recent experimental measurements.@xcite a direct comparison of calculations for the @xmath6-type with the recently published experiments is inhibited by the presence of impurity phase zno in the measured samples and hence no clear trend is discernible from the experiments.@xcite presently , stimulated by our calculational results , we have successfully synthesized a new batch of zno free ruin@xmath4zn@xmath5 samples and measured their thermoelectric properties ( details described in section vi ) .",
    "the trend in measured @xmath11 is now consistent with our calculated results for the @xmath6-doped systems too ( refer to fig.[expt](a ) ) .",
    "furthermore , transport measurements on the parent compound ruin@xmath0 find a change in the sign of @xmath11 from @xmath20-type to @xmath6-type around 350 k. similar behavior was observed for the related compound ruga@xmath0.@xcite the authors assigned the sign change in @xmath11 to the shift of the valence band to an extrinsic region along with the presence of light holes in the system and proposed a two - band model , one each for electron and hole , respectively for evaluating @xmath11 . in this scenario , holes with higher mobilities can influence @xmath11 and change the sign from negative to positive values.@xcite however , modeling transport properties including the presence of extrinsic charge carriers within a bulk system is more involved and beyond the scope of the present investigation .    as discussed earlier , notwithstanding the tetragonal symmetry of the crystal structure of ruin@xmath0 ,",
    "the polyhedra of the basic building blocks form a three dimensional packing .",
    "previously , measurements on single crystals of ruin@xmath0 have found a somewhat weak anisotropic resistivity along [ 110 ] and [ 001 ] orientations.@xcite collected in fig.[seebeck_axis ] are the values of @xmath11 and @xmath47 along the crystallographic @xmath28 and @xmath29 directions .",
    "consistent with the three dimensional packing of polyhedra , the anisotropy is moderate in the calculated transport coefficients , with the @xmath6-doped system displaying a larger anisotropy than that of the @xmath20-doped variant .",
    "this result can be qualitatively understood by analyzing the band structures shown in figs.[sndoping ] and [ zndoping ] . for the @xmath20-doped system ,",
    "the bands crossing the fermi level disperse in a similar fashion along the various symmetry directions . on the contrary , for the @xmath6-doped system",
    ", the bands crossing the fermi level are more dispersive in the @xmath48 plane ( x@xmath36m@xmath38 ) compared to the @xmath29 diretion ( @xmath49z ) .",
    "measured thermoelectric properties of ruin@xmath4zn@xmath5 as a function of temperature .",

    "note that @xmath13 has a linear dependence to @xmath34 . assuming a constant @xmath34 for the various substitution variants , the increasing conductivity for either hole or electron doping reflects the fact that more charge carriers are present for the transport process . due to the presence of a rather flat band with a larger effective mass close to the conduction band minimum",
    ", sn substituted systems exhibit smaller electrical conductivities compared to the zn substituted systems at low temperatures and low substitution concentrations .",
    "the trend observed for the thermopower previously is thus different than that of the conductivity , which will result in an interesting trend for the power factor ( @xmath52 ) , the numerator in the expression for the thermoelectric figure of merit @xmath3 . to this end , we have plotted @xmath52 relative to the relaxation time @xmath34 in fig.[powerfactor ] . for temperatures up to 300 k ,",
    "the power factors of the sn substituted systems are enhanced compared to those of the zn substituted systems .",
    "beyond 300 k , the trend is reversed and the hole doped systems exhibit an enhanced power factor . a quantitative estimate for the dimensionless figure of merit @xmath3 from dft ,",
    "entails an accurate estimation of @xmath15 , the lattice thermal conductivity .",
    "this involves solving the phonon boltzmann transport equations exactly and requires an accurate description of the harmonic and anharmonic interatomic forces , which is presently a formidable task and is left for a more extended study in the future .",
