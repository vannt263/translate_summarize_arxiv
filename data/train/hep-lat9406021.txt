    "we are also interested in the fields themselves , for example whether they are governed by dual superconductivity , whether they appear coulomb like at small separations as expected from asymptotic freedom , and what excited strings look like .",

    "we then attempt to extrapolate our results to large time extent of the loops .",
    "the alternative is to use polyakov lines to represent the sources .",
    "but then the area law forces one to work at finite temperature and then extrapolate to zero temperature .",

    "interpolation in four dimensions is required in order to add these functions to come up with the energy density .",
    "the most obvious method such as cubic splines in four dimensions is not very satisfactory and tends to give rather obvious interpolation artifacts in surface plots .",
    "we decided on a method used by commercial surface plot software termed kriging. it adapted nicely to four dimensions without biasing any particular direction in four - space .",

    "it is very difficult to get accurate moments of these profiles since they are dominated by values of the flux at large transverse distance where data is very scant .",
    "our compromise was to find a good fitting function with a very economical parametrization .",
    "we settled on a simple function that is exponential for large distance and gaussian for small distances .",
    "it did remarkably well in that the fit was very insensitive to the sample of points used to fit over a very wide range of transverse distances .",

    "briefly , our lattice size is @xmath20 .",
    "we ran three values of @xmath21 2.3 , 2.4 and 2.5 .",
    "the corresponding lattics spacings @xmath22 were taken to be a(2.3 ) = 0.171 fm , a(2.4 ) = 0.128 fm , and a(2.5 ) = 0.089 fm .",
    "we measured wilson loops for all sizes up to @xmath23 which are reported in ref .",
    "@xcite as well as the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix calculated from these loops .",
    "an important ingredient in our simulation is the analytic multihit technique in which one evaluates link integrals of the operators being measured .",

    "the criterion to be able to use eqn .",
    "( [ 2.1 ] ) to evaluate a particular ( bold ) link is that the corresponding staples do not involve any of the other bold links .",
    "a straight line of links satisfies this criterion , but links forming a corner do not .",
    "therefore the plaquette and the corners of the wilson loop have to be treated separately .",
    "further since we are trying to measure the self energy of the quarks we need to bring the plaquette close to and in fact touching the wilson loop which will result in further special cases .",
    "it is expedient to measure the wilson loop and plaquette for each position and orientation independently and then evaluate the cross correlation .",
    "this is fine as long as a bold link on the wilson loop does not overlap with a staple link on the multihit plaquette or vice versa . since we make use of fast fourier transforms to do the cross correlations all relative positions of the two are automatically obtained .",
    "we must then go back and recalculate the correct exceptions separately .",
    "we have the choice of either doing more integrals analycially or drop back to fewer analytic integrations for these exceptions .",
    "we chose the latter , maintaining all possible analytic integrations that could be constructed with the above three analytic results .",
    "our compromise in all these special cases was the following : we calculated ( a ) the plaquette and multihit plaquette , ( b ) the wilson loop with all multihit links and the wilson loop with a gap as shown in fig .",
    "then the correlations were done using three cases :",
    "( i ) for large separations of the wilson loop and plaquette , all links were multihit .",
    "( ii ) as the plaquette is brought close to the wilson loop , the multihit plaquette was dropped .",
    "( iii ) when the plaquette was brought in contact with the wilson loop , certain multihit links were also dropped as indicated by the gap in fig .",
    "this compromise means that having chosen the gap in one particular direction we can not get self energy data at other places on the loop for example to explore the self energy for loop with t and r reversed .",

    "the six components of the flux @xmath48 are defined at the center of the corresponding plaquette and hence are all at different space - time points . finding a good interpolation method in four dimensions is not as simple as it might seem . in order to combine them we employed a four dimensional interpolation method that minimizes the variance of the estimated value of the function . in other words",
    "as one varies the value of each input point over say one standard deviation , one requires that the linear interpolated function be as insensitive as possible .",
    "there is much literature on this under the name of kriging  @xcite in mining engineering and a two dimensional version is employed in surface plot software .",
    "consider a function , @xmath49 , that is given as a statistical variable at a set of points , @xmath50 .",

    "define an estimate of the function , @xmath53 , as the linear combination @xmath54 where the sum is over a subset of the points , and the coefficients @xmath55 s are determined by the set of points @xmath56 and the point @xmath8 .",
    "now use this estimate to evaluate the function at one of the given points @xmath57 and consider the variance of the difference of the function @xmath58 and its estimate @xmath59 @xmath60 the sum excludes the point @xmath57 .",
    "the covariance matrix is defined @xmath61 the kriging method determines the coefficients @xmath55 by minimizing @xmath62 subject to a constraint , i.e. we minimize @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a lagrange multiplier .",
    "the constraint arises from the condition that when applied to all points in the set , @xmath59 underestimates @xmath58 as often as it overestimates it : @xmath65 using @xmath66 this gives the constraint @xmath67 .",
    "hence the coefficients are given by the equations @xmath68 we want to apply this to interpolate @xmath49 at a general point .",
    "the @xmath55 s are determined from the covariance matrix at the general point .",
    "since the @xmath55 s are independent of the overall normalization of the covariance matrix and the relevant property is how the covariance matrix varies with distance between the two arguments , so in practical applications one assumes that the covariance matrix falls as a function of distance , going to zero at large separations .",
    "our choice is : @xmath69 one can easily check that if one chose the set @xmath70 to include the point @xmath57 , then the corresponding @xmath71 , and all other @xmath55 s equal zero . for a point near one of the @xmath50 ,",
    "the corresponding @xmath72 dominates .",
    "since we have an ad hoc ansatz for the covariance matrix the actual errors in our data do not enter in the interpolation .",
    "in fact this is just a method of linear interpolation which weighs the nearby points more than the far points which is divorced from its statistical origins .",
    "the freedom in this method is in the choice of neighboring points and the value of the correlation length @xmath73 .",
    "our criterion was to get a smooth interpolation which did not produce variations of the order of a lattice spacing .",
    "we found @xmath74 the lattice spacing and a radius that included one or two dozen points in the four dimensional neighborhood of the interpolated point .",
    "the errors were calculated by linearly interpolating the errors from the neighboring points .",
    "this overestimates the errors since it assumes that the values used to interpolate are completely correlated . assuming they are completely uncorrelated then interpolating the variance gives an error typically less than half of the linearly interpolated errors . since we do not know the covariance matrix we took the worst case .    using this method we filled in every point at the half lattice spacing for each component which then allowed us to combine any components .",

    "these two components cancel in calculating the energy and add in the action .",
    "they are the widest of the four profiles and hence the action has a wider profile than the energy .",
    "[ f30 ] shows the action and energy for the same parameters as above .",
    "the peaks around the quarks rise above the background equally in the energy and action since they come predominantly from the electric components .",
    "the michael sum rules confirm this behavior as described in the earlier paper  @xcite .",
    "the flux tube profiles for action and energy are quite different .",
    "note the large cancellation in the energy compared to the action and the resulting difficulty in measuring the former .",
    "rotational symmetry is reasonably well restored in the action profiles but there are large lattice artifacts in the energy profiles .",
    "the basic parameters we are interested in is to find the peak value and widths of the flux density of the energy and action .",
    "obtaining good data on the second moment of the profile in order to determine its width is problematic .",
    "the profiles fall sharply and the fourth moment needed to estimate error would be sampling only large distances from the axis where the signal to noise is small .",
    "instead we fitted the energy and action density in the plane at the midpoint between @xmath82 and @xmath83 using the function @xmath84 or rewriting in terms of the width at half maximum , @xmath85 @xmath86 the peak value , @xmath87 , and the width @xmath85 , were very well determined using a @xmath88 fit for each of 70 cases of different loop sizes and values of @xmath89 .",

    "this parameter was less well determined .",
    "we attempted to include an additive constant to the function since our sum rule paper gave evidence for it .",
    "however this gave too much freedom to the fit and gave unstable answers .",
    "we also tried a gaussian plus background constant and this did not fit nearly as well as the function chosen . in conclusion ,",
    "the data is not good enough to determine four parameters , and the best function we found has some ambiguity in the choice but the peak value , @xmath87 , and width at half maximum @xmath85 are very well determined . the exponential fall off of this function is perhaps modeling a true exponential falloff plus possibly a background which we believe is there due to the fact that we are measuring the flux relative to a reference point that is not at infinity .",
    "our complete fitting results are shown in tables  [ t10]-[t60 ] for action and energy distributions .",
    "the four numbers for each loop size are the peak value , @xmath87 in @xmath91 , the width at half maximum , @xmath85 in @xmath92 , the exponential decay length , @xmath93 in @xmath92 , and the integration of the area under the curve to give the string tension in @xmath94 . as a reminder ,",
    "since we are looking at the middle time slice and looking at the mid - point of the flux tube , these parameters are measured in the @xmath95 plane for @xmath96 at the middle of the wilson loop .",
    "our characterization of a good fit requires explanation .",
    "we do not report the @xmath88 because the fit is used to average out the lattice artifacts in the rotational symmetry . for small loops the errors in the data are quite small but",
    "rotational symmetry is not equally good . as a consequence @xmath88",
    "can be very large for fits since the fitting function is rotationally invariant .",
    "when the errors in the data approach the size of the lattice artifacts @xmath88/degree of freedom drops to the order 1 .",
    "we believe the fit is good because of the stability of the numbers over changing the set of points used in the fit .",
    "we determined the parameters using 9 sets of points , choosing the interior of circles of radius @xmath97 to @xmath98 .",
    "( recall our interpolation produces values at every point at half a lattice spacing . ) for all our fits the variation in the parameters over this set of points was of the order or less that the statistical minuit errors quoted for the parameters in the tables .",
    "we did not fold in this systematic error .",
    "however we believe we have overestimated errors in the interpolation and we believe the effects of these two contributions are comparable .",

    "because of the symmetry of flux distribution about the midway point between the @xmath18 pair , we only show the distribution from one end to the midpoint between the @xmath18 pair .",
    "one can see that the peak values are in the neighborhood of the source , which is caused by the large self - energy concentrated around the source . however , the flux action values between the @xmath18 pair are comparable to the peak values .",
    "this implies that the integrations of flux action on the transverse slice near the @xmath18 pair are not dominated by the self - energy contributions , although the density values due to self - energy are large , their distribution regions are very narrow .",
    "this agrees with the action density distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ f30 ] ( a ) , where the peaks of action density are restricted in a narrow region at each source . from fig .",
    "[ f150 ] one can also see that away from the outside of the @xmath18 sources the flux action decreases rapidly with the distance from the source , and almost vanishes at the moderate distance , @xmath145 ( i.e. , @xmath146 ) .",
    "however , the flux action between the @xmath18 pair is large , and almost keeps to be a constant as @xmath147 increases .",
    "this agrees with the expectation for the flux tube formation .",
