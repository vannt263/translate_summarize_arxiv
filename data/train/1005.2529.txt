    "p2-na@xmath7coo@xmath2 ( also called @xmath8-phase ) is composed of alternating layers of na and coo@xmath2 with a hexagonal in - plane network that can be described by space group p6@xmath9/mmc.@xcite na vacancy ordering has been an important subject both experimentally and theoretically following the discovery of rich phase diagram of na@xmath7coo@xmath2,@xcite from the a - type antiferromagnetic ( af ) ordering for x@xmath100.75 , to af and metal - to - insulator transitions near x=0.5 , and the superconductivity found in the hydrated sample of x @xmath11 1/3.@xcite in particular , the discovery of na superlattice described by the multi - vacancy cluster model proposed by roger _",
    "_ has generated additional interest in the exploration of the origin of na vacancy ordering and its impact on the title compound.@xcite    we have demonstrated that the particularly stable phases found near 0.71 , 0.50 , 0.33 , and 0.25 also show sharp drop of the na atom diffusion coefficients at room temperature.@xcite however , it is quite surprising that the commonly predicted stable phases near x = 3/4 and 2/3 do not exist , as revealed by our single crystal electrochemical de - intercalation studies at room temperature .",
    "the na superlattice as a result of na ion ordering has been solved satisfactorily for x @xmath11 0.833 , 0.820 , 0.77 and 0.71 so far , based on na multi - vacancy model of di- , tri- , and quadri - vacancy cluster ordering.@xcite for example , x = 0.71 is composed of alternating na layers with tri- and quadri - vacancy clusters ordered in a large simple hexagonal superlattice of size @xmath5a.@xcite the implication of such na vacancy ordering has helped us understand the origin of small cross sections of the fermi surface hole pockets observed by shubnikov - de haas oscillation and the intriguing coexistence of metallic conductivity with curie - weiss behavior .",
    "this led us to propose that the na vacancy ordering creates one special partial localization environment for the doped holes , i.e. , part of the charge is localized near the vacancy center and the rest are itinerant throughout the vacancy - free region .",
    "while na vacancy is unavoidable for na@xmath7coo@xmath2 samples prepared under ambient pressure , even under pure oxygen environment , the most probable na content for samples prepared using solid state reaction is usually in the range of 0.75 - 0.85.@xcite different vacancy ordering patterns for x = 2/3 have been proposed based on density functional theory calculations.@xcite however , single crystal diffraction studies on na@xmath7coo@xmath2 have not revealed any signature of na ion ordering for x = 2/3,@xcite on the other hand , platova _ et al .",
    "_ have proposed based on nmr and x - ray diffraction results , that a simple hexagonal superlattice of @xmath5a exists in na@xmath0coo@xmath2 where powder sample were carefully prepared under oxygen environment at 700@xmath12 c and quenched.@xcite the proposed microscopic structure is very different from the tri- and quadra - vacancy layer model we proposed for na@xmath4coo@xmath2 .",
    "it is very surprising that the physical properties of their samples are very similar to ours despite the difference in na concentration and their proposed superlattice size is identical to that found in na@xmath4coo@xmath2 based synchrotron x - ray laue and electron diffraction studies on single crystal sample with electrochemically fine - tuned x.@xcite we have pointed out previously that the controversy could have resulted from differences in oxygen content,@xcite i.e. , the identical @xmath5a simple hexagonal superlattice is a result of identical average co valence between na@xmath4coo@xmath2 and na@xmath0coo@xmath3 .",
    "herein , we provide conclusive evidence to resolve the controversy regarding the @xmath5a superlattice ordering observed in x = 2/3 .",
    "it turns out that oxygen content plays an important factor that can not be ignored when discussing all related physical properties in the na@xmath7coo@xmath1 system .",
    "the nature of immobile and randomly distributed oxygen vacancy at room temperature renders the na ion ordering more complicated , especially when the ordering along the c- axis ( staging ) is considered as well.@xcite",
    "single crystal samples have been prepared from floating zone method growth , following an additional electrochemical de - intercalation technique as reported previously.@xcite oxygen environment with pressure higher than 8 atm has been kept in the optical floating - zone growth chamber to reduce na loss due to evaporation and the generation of co@xmath9o@xmath13 impurity phase in particular , to prevent the occurrence of oxygen deficiency .",
    "high quality single crystal na@xmath7coo@xmath2 of x @xmath11 0.84 could be obtained reproducibly starting from polycrystalline feed rod prepared from na@xmath2co@xmath9 and co@xmath9o@xmath13 of na : co=0.85:1 ratio .",
    "samples with na content of 0.71 and 2/3 were prepared from electrochemical de - intercalation as reported previously,@xcite where the as - grown crystal sample of na@xmath14coo@xmath2 was used as working electrode , pt as counter electrode , and ag / agcl with sieved liquid junction as reference electrode .",

    "we have prepared sample with x = 0.67@xmath150.01 and verified by both the x - ray lattice parameter analysis of linear c(x ) extrapolation reported previously and epma to confirm this crucial concentration for this study .",
    "additional oxygen control has been performed using tga scan under various gas flows , including oxygen and air , up to 950k .",
    "the as - prepared single crystal samples of nearly oxygen deficiency - free samples for x = 0.71 and x = 2/3 have been ground into powder and go through additional annealing under tga as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig - tga ] .",
    "we find that a significant weight loss occurs for x = 2/3 only near 700k and this weight loss is recoverable under oxygen . on the other hand , x = 0.71 sample is stable at the same temperature range , whether the flowing gas is oxygen or air . the reversible weight loss for x = 2/3 sample near 700k is about 0.30 wt@xmath16 , which corresponds to an oxygen loss of 0.02 .",
    "interestingly , the co valence of na@xmath4coo@xmath2 and na@xmath0coo@xmath3 are identical , and this thermal analysis suggests that the most stable average co valence is near + 3.29 . to prepare oxygen deficient na@xmath0coo@xmath3 single crystal sample for further study , we annealed the as - prepared na@xmath0coo@xmath2 single crystal sample at 700 @xmath12c for 12 hours and quenched , similar to the method used by platova _",

[ fig : fig - laue ] .",
    "the laue pattern of na@xmath4coo@xmath2 shows perfect superlattice of @xmath5a as reported previously.@xcite the superstructure of na@xmath4coo@xmath2 has been modeled to be composed of alternating layers of sodium tri- ( t ) and quadri - vacancy ( q ) clusters ordered in simple hexagonal shape.@xcite additional structure refinement suggests that these alternating layers of tqtqtq stacking has a 3c periodicity described by a right - hand screw symmetry advanced na - trimers along the c - axis.@xcite while na@xmath0coo@xmath2 shows no superlattice formation , as indicated in fig .",

    "[ fig : fig - laue ] shows some systematic missing of superlattice diffraction planes for na@xmath0coo@xmath3 as comparing with that of na@xmath4coo@xmath2 , which suggests that even though these two samples possess identical superlattice size of @xmath5a , subtle difference must exists as suggested by the nmr studies.@xcite these results seem to suggest that similar na ion ordering can be achieved as long as the average co valence is close to + 3.29 .",
    "experimentally na@xmath4coo@xmath2 has been shown to be the most stable phase as indicated by its significant sharp drop of the diffusion coefficient and the convincingly refined crystal structure of na tri- and quadri - vacancy cluster stacking of @xmath5a@xmath6@xmath5a@xmath63c superlattice ordering,@xcite the observed identical superlattice size suggests that na@xmath0coo@xmath3 can very well be a defect type variation of the ideal na@xmath4coo@xmath2 . to provide a more quantitative description to the current finding ,",
    "let us take as an empirical fact that na@xmath4coo@xmath2 with the tri- and quadri - vacancy ordering is most stable .",
    "the na@xmath0coo@xmath3 with oxygen vacancy means that for every 48 co atoms , one oxygen is missing , i.e. , 1 out of 4 @xmath5a@xmath6@xmath5a supercell contains an oxygen vacancy .",
    "in order not to pay too much coulomb energy for the o@xmath17 vacancy two additional na vacancies will appear .",
    "then on average the two tri - vacancy layers become quadra - vacancies resulting in 8 na per 12 cobalt atoms , i.e. , we are led to a defect type na@xmath4coo@xmath2 structure of na@xmath0coo@xmath3 stoichiometry .",
    "another way of saying is that the oxygen vacancy is frozen in place randomly but the na is mobile at room temperature .",
    "the additional missing na ( relative to 0.71 ) will be bound close to the missing oxygen in order to maintain the @xmath5a superlattice .",
    "the reason for this stability presumably has large contribution from madelung energy , so it is at least partly electron driven .",
    "in fact nicolaou _",
    "have also proposed that the stacking layer potential could create a special charge ordering within the coo@xmath2 layer based on their arpes experimental results.@xcite    the superlattice found in na@xmath0coo@xmath3 must be robust because it is prepared from a high temperature quenching procedure of easy disorder introduction , while na@xmath0coo@xmath2 is prepared from a slow cooling process under oxygen atmosphere .",
    "we must note that oxygen vacancy is not mobile at room temperature while na ion self diffusion is active above @xmath11150 - 200k .",
    "the randomly distributed oxygen vacancy at the level of @xmath110.02 per formula unit for na@xmath0coo@xmath3 must be tolerated in order to allow na layer to form a superstructure similar to that of na@xmath4coo@xmath2 , it is difficult to understand within the proposal of platova _",
    "et al_. for na@xmath0coo@xmath2 why oxygen vacancies are needed to stabilize the superlattice structure . in any case , based on our findings it is clear that the role of oxygen deficiencies need to be accounted for in the modeling of the @xmath18 material .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     magnetic susceptibility measurement results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig - chi ] .",
    "the displayed data are powder average of the single crystal measurement , i.e. , 2/3@xmath21 + 1/3@xmath22 without considering the minor correction of in - plane anisotropy .",
    "there is no magnetic anomaly found down to 2k for all three samples .",
    "the curie - weiss behavior for a system with metallic property has long been a puzzle,@xcite and it transforms from curie - weiss to pauli - like behavior only when x is reduced to the level of nearly half - filled na layer.@xcite based on our proposed na vacancy cluster model published previously,@xcite na tri- and quadri - vacancy cluster superlattice ordering could be responsible for the curie - weiss metal behavior , i.e. , part of the doped holes are localized near the na vacancy cluster center while the rest are itinerant .",
    "both localized and itinerant electrons should contribute to the magnetic susceptibility .",
    "we propose that the total magnetic susceptibility should include contributions from temperature independent core diamagnetic @xmath23 , van vleck paramagnetic @xmath24 , pauli paramagnetic @xmath25 , and the spin susceptibility from localized spins which are tentatively described by a curie - weiss like behavior of c/(t-@xmath20 ) .",
    "the curie - weiss behavior for all three samples has been fitted following an equation of @xmath19+c/(t-@xmath20 ) in the range of 100 - 300k quite satisfactorily as seen in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig - chi ] , where c corresponds to the number of localized spins , weiss temperature @xmath20 indicates the mean field average of the magnetic coupling strength among isolated spins , and @xmath19 = @xmath23+@xmath24+@xmath25 .",
    "the fitted parameters for @xmath26(t ) described by the curie - weiss law are shown in table  [ tab : tablei ] .",
    "the fitted @xmath19 values do not provide reliable physical meaning before each individual contribution can be analyzed .",
    "it is not surprising to find that c and @xmath20 are about the same for na@xmath4coo@xmath2 and na@xmath0coo@xmath3 , which implies that the quantity and the coupling strength of isolated spins are nearly identical .",
    "na@xmath0coo@xmath2 shows less isolated spins even though more holes are introduced compared with na@xmath0coo@xmath3 .",
    "clearly , formation of long - range na multi - vacancy cluster ordering such as that demonstrated by the ideal na@xmath4coo@xmath2 , is prohibited in na@xmath0coo@xmath2 , unless oxygen vacancy is introduced .",
    "the co - existence of local moments and itinerant electrons is a complicated many - body problem which is not fully understood .",
    "the data fitting using curie - weiss law plus pauli is only a crude beginning .",
    "for instance , the @xmath27 coefficient found for na@xmath4coo@xmath2 corresponds to a @xmath28 local moment per doped hole , which is clearly inconsistent with metallic behavior .",
    "we also acknowledge that another point of view has been proposed in the literature , i.e. , the curie - weiss behavior signifies an almost ferromagnetic metal@xcite , as described , for instance , by the self consistent renormalized ( scr ) spin fluctuation theory.@xcite however , in the standard scr theory , the spin susceptibility saturates at low temperatures leading to fermi liquid behavior whereas in the present system @xmath26 continues to rise down to 4  k ( as seen in fig.3 ) .",
    "such a low fermi liquid scale is not expected without fine tuning .",
    "furthermore , the resistivity exhibits a linear @xmath29 dependence below 100  k and cross - over to @xmath30 below 4  k , while the specific heat exhibits @xmath31 dependence.@xcite at the moment , neither the itinerant spin fluctuation model nor the partial local moment picture is capable of explaining these anomalies .",
    "we leave this complicated and interesting issue open for future discussions .",
    "the main point of the present analysis is simply that the magnetic properties of na@xmath4coo@xmath2 and na@xmath0coo@xmath3 are very similar , while that of na@xmath0coo@xmath2 has distinctly different @xmath27 and @xmath20 .",
    "we have also performed 4-probe resistivity measurements on the na@xmath4coo@xmath2 , na@xmath0coo@xmath2 , and na@xmath0coo@xmath3 crystals as shown in fig  [ fig : fig - resistivity ] .",
    "for na@xmath4coo@xmath2 , the resistivity shows metallic behavior and drops with decreasing temperature . there is a crossover at about 100  k ,",
    "below which the resistivity becomes practically linear in t. similar behavior has also been observed in na@xmath0coo@xmath2 and na@xmath0coo@xmath3 .",
    "however , such deviation from the t - linear dependence at low temperature is evident and more significant in na@xmath0coo@xmath2 .",
    "in addition , we note that the resistivity value is more than twice as large in na@xmath0coo@xmath2 at low temperature , which suggests a shorter carrier lifetime due to a more disordered phase in na@xmath0coo@xmath2 .",
    "these observations are in accord with the absence of na superstructure ordering as mentioned earlier and also imply an intimate correlation between the na ordering and the co la yer electronic structure .    longitudinal magnetoresistance ( lmr ) and transverse magnetoresistance ( tmr ) were measured for the three samples , where lmr and tmr were obtained under a magnetic field up to 14 tesla applied parallel and perpendicular to the coo@xmath2 plane , respectively .",
    "the orbital magnetoresistance ( omr ) was determined by subtracting tmr with lmr in order to exclude the spin related contribution to the tmr .",
    "a comparison of lmr and omr for the three samples is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig - mr ] .",
    "the omr is positive for all three samples with quadratic magnetic field dependence as expected from orbital contribution , which is simply proportional to the square of carrier mobility .",
    "na@xmath0coo@xmath2 shows smaller omr than that of na@xmath4coo@xmath2 and na@xmath0coo@xmath3 , which infers a shorter carrier lifetime in a more disordered na@xmath0coo@xmath2 as expected . on the other hand ,",
    "lmr is typically derived from spin effect , where the negative lmr is most likely associated with the suppression of spin scattering due to the field alignment of localized moment .",
    "we find that the lmr in na@xmath0coo@xmath2 is nearly half of that in na@xmath4coo@xmath2 and na@xmath0coo@xmath3 at low temperature , which suggests less spin scatterers in the system .",
    "again , the main point is the similarity between na@xmath4coo@xmath2 and na@xmath0coo@xmath3 and their contrast with na@xmath0coo@xmath2 .",
    "we also remark that the extraction of carrier density from hall coefficient data is not possible because of its strong temperature dependence due to strongly correlated nature .",
    "in summary , using single crystal samples of well controlled oxygen and sodium content , we have provided strong evidence to resolve the controversy of superlattice ordering found in na@xmath7coo@xmath2 of x=0.71 and 2/3 .",
    "synchrotron x - ray laue diffraction results indicate that there is no sodium ordering in na@xmath0coo@xmath2 at room temperature , while na@xmath0coo@xmath3 , which has identical co valence to that of na@xmath4coo@xmath2 , shows identical @xmath5a simple hexagonal superstructure to that of na@xmath4coo@xmath2 , also with nearly identical magnetic and transport properties .",
    "these results imply that na@xmath4coo@xmath2 with @xmath5a@xmath6@xmath5a@xmath63c superlattice is the most stable structure at this particular concentration , while na@xmath0coo@xmath3 of identical average co valence possesses a nearly identical na superstructure and magnetic properties with the help of oxygen defect generation .",
    "this proposed model is supported in part by the higher resistivity found in na@xmath0coo@xmath2 without na superstructure .",
    "studies on na ion ordering based on screened inter - sodium interaction without considering the involved oxygen deficiency could result in misleading prediction or interpretation .",
