    "stephen hawking s discovery that black holes radiate thermally has extremely striking consequences : it allows evolution of pure quantum states into mixed quantum states .",
    "the conclusion that has to be drawn from this  information loss paradox \" is that our present laws of quantum mechanics are insufficient for describing a process such as the formation and subsequent evaporation of a black hole , and that the possibility of non - unitary time evolution has to be introduced for an adequate description . hawking s discovery and its consequences are explained in more detail in section two .",
    "+   + however , since the framework of quantum mechanics seems to rest on unitarity , most physicists will tend to look for possible ways to get around such a drastic modification .",
    "these attempts are based on the fact that hawking s calculation was done in an approximation where quantum fluctuations of the spacetime geometry are neglected , and so one might expect quantum effects to become important in an accurate description . it will be shown in section three that it seems impossible to find a consistent description in which pure states will always remain pure .",
    "+   + in section four i shall analyse the question what non - unitary laws of physics could possibly look like in more detail .",
    "inevitable violations of energy or momentum conservation , locality and causality , or lorentz covariance were found in some models that allow non - unitarity in quantum mechanics .",
    "it also seems that noether s theorem is inapplicable when time evolution of quantum states is non - unitary .",
    "other authors came to different conclusions and were apparently able to construct models without these pathologies .",
    "i will discuss whether any satisfactory resolution of the debate has been reached .",
    "+   + stephen hawking , who started the whole discussion , had his own viewpoint on how one should think about dynamic processes in curved spacetimes , due to the difficulties with defining local observables and time evolution in quantum gravity .",
    "he rejected a local description of quantum gravity , and the global description of quantum gravity led him to conclude that information loss was not a problem and that evolution in quantum mechanics was fully unitary .",
    "+ there are other general arguments why nonlocal effects should become apparent in processes involving quantum gravity , possibly restoring unitarity , and why the arguments apparently ruling out unitary evolution may not be applicable to black - hole evaporation . these more recent ideas will be discussed in section five .",
    "+   + in section six , the results will be summarised , with an outlook to future developments .",
    "the appendix contains a few calculations in detail that have been left out of the main part of this essay , and also a short introduction to the path integral approach to quantum gravity .",
    "+   + i will use planck units , so that @xmath0 . also , there is no boltzmann s constant .      throughout this essay",
    ", carter - penrose diagrams will be used to illustrate the causal relations in a given spacetime .",
    "these diagrams are conventional in relativity , but perhaps less well known in general .",
    "to construct such a diagram , as first done by carter in @xcite , one chooses a ( 1 + 1)-dimensional submanifold of the spacetime .",
    "since we will always basically consider an evaporating schwarzschild black hole with spherical symmetry , we will choose a submanifold @xmath1 .",
    "one then goes to different coordinates which are of finite range , e.g. by the transformation @xmath2 for time . of course",
    ", now the metric will become infinite as these new coordinates approach their upper and lower limits . by applying a conformal transformation to metric",
    ", one can obtain a metric which is regular even as these limits are approached , so that it is possible to attach a  boundary \" to the spacetime . in the previous example , this boundary would consist of @xmath3 .",
    "+   + while a conformal transformation changes scales and distances , it leaves the causal relations in the spacetime invariant , since the light cones of a metric @xmath4 and the rescaled version @xmath5 are identical .",
    "since any two - dimensional metric is conformal to a flat metric , by an appropriate choice of coordinates one can achieve that the rescaled metric is flat .",
    "then a diagram of the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional new spacetime with its boundaries illustrates the causal relations of the original spacetime ; at each point of this diagram one can draw light cones at 45 degrees which give the directions of light rays . the boundary  points \" ( two - spheres in the four - dimensional spacetime ) @xmath6 and @xmath7",
    "are called  future timelike infinity \" and  past timelike infinity \" ; timelike geodesics of the original spacetime can be extended to begin or end in these points in the new compact spacetime .",
    "similarly , spacelike geodesics end in  spacelike infinity \" @xmath8",
    ". light rays always begin and end in  past null infinity \" @xmath9 and  future null infinity \" @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "+   + it is conventional to draw wiggly lines for singularities and solid lines for event horizons and boundaries of spacetime .",
    "i use a dotted line for @xmath11 which corresponds to the origin in spherical polar coordinates , and is not to be confused with a boundary of spacetime . in fig .",
    "1 , a light ray reaching @xmath11 would just be  reflected \" out to positive values of @xmath12 again .",
    "spacelike infinity @xmath8 corresponds to @xmath13 .",
    "the area covered by collapsing matter in fig .",
    "1 does not have any physical significance  since scales change under conformal transformations , one could transform it into a different shape or area .",
    "however , the event horizon is always at 45 degrees . a particle that has passed it can not escape on a timelike curve which always has to be at less than 45 degrees to the vertical . in fig .",
    "4 , the  baby universe \" can be reached by going through the singularity of the black hole .",
    "by doing an analysis of quantum field theory at the event horizon , stephen hawking discovered in 1973 that a black hole emits radiation exactly like a blackbody at the hawking temperature @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the surface gravity of the black hole @xcite . for a schwarzschild black hole ,",
    "the total flux of radiation emitted per time is proportional to @xmath16 , so that the time for a black hole to completely evaporate is proportional to @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the black hole mass .",
    "+   + as a heuristic , but demonstrative , picture of this process , one might think of pair creation just outside the event horizon caused by vacuum fluctuations , so that one particle can escape to infinity while the other one falls into the hole , this one having negative energy so that total energy is conserved @xcite .",
    "although this particle appears to have negative energy relative to infinity , it can exist as a real particle with timelike momentum vector because the killing vector which represents time translations is spacelike inside the horizon .",
    "+   + hawking derived this famous result in a  semi - classical \" approximation ; he used quantum field theory on a curved background with a spacetime satisfying the classical einstein equations . on a length scale as small as planck size",
    ", quantum fluctuations of the metric itself are generally expected to cause the calculation to break down .",
    "+ the notable fact about hawking radiation is that it is exactly thermal and thus completely independent of the detailed structure of anything that collapsed to form the black hole .",
    "this is plausible since according to the uniqueness theorems (  no - hair theorems \" ) of general relativity , the geometry outside a black hole is characterised only by the parameters mass , charge , and angular momentum .",
    "+   + this is the origin of the information loss paradox @xcite : a black hole will continue evaporating until it has disappeared , leaving only thermal radiation .",
    "in particular , a system that is in a pure quantum state might collapse to form a black hole ; after the process of black hole formation and evaporation is completed , this system has evolved into a mixed state , which means that non - unitary evolution has occurred , in conflict with the laws of quantum mechanics .",
    "this is the paradox that will be discussed in this essay .",
    "+   + firstly , what does  information loss \" mean in this context ? given a quantum system in a pure state , there exist _ non - degenerate _",
    "observables so that a measurement on the system will give a unique predictable result @xcite .",
    "( of course , this is not true for general observables . )",
    "this is a property of pure states ; for a mixed state there are no such observables . in this sense ,",
    "complete information exists only for pure states .",
    "looking at the von neumann entropy @xmath19 @xmath20 if and only if @xmath21 represents a pure state , since then the only eigenvalues of @xmath21 are one and zero .",
    "information loss ( or loss of quantum coherence ) is then defined as an increase in the entropy @xmath22 , which is exactly what happens in black hole evaporation . for any unitary operator @xmath23 @xmath24 since @xmath22 only depends on the eigenvalues of @xmath21 which are unaffected by a unitary change of basis .",
    "therefore , a pure state will always remain pure under unitary evolution .",
    "it is well - known that already in ordinary quantum mechanics all measurements and the time evolution of systems can be described entirely by density matrices . hawking proposed that a modification of quantum mechanics should be based on density matrices in order to allow a description of mixed states @xcite .",
    "time evolution between negative and positive infinity is then described by a superscattering operator @xmath25 , so that @xmath26 where @xmath25 is an operator preserving hermiticity , positivity and normalisation , replacing the usual @xmath22 matrix . for @xmath21 representing a pure state one obtains from @xmath27 @xmath28 according to @xcite , this factorisation requires the axiom of asymptotic completeness , the assumption that asymptotic states in the infinite past or future provide a basis for the full hilbert space .",
    "@xcite rejected the axiom for curved spacetimes and considered @xmath25 as the fundamental operator determining the dynamics of a system .",
    "+ @xmath25 may be a non - unitary operator , but reconstruction of the initial from the final state may be possible , as @xmath25 can be invertible @xcite .",
    "invariant , which means the @xmath29 theorem of quantum field theory is violated .",
    "that however relies heavily on poincar invariance .",
    "] +   + banks , peskin and susskind @xcite now assumed that there is , at least after some coarse - grained averaging , a linear differential equation describing dynamics local in time @xmath30 it is this starting point that will have to be reconsidered later . by choosing a complete orthonormal set of hermitian matrices @xmath31 with @xmath32",
    ", they rewrote this as @xmath33-\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{\\alpha,\\beta\\neq 0}h_{\\alpha\\beta}\\left(q^{\\beta}q^{\\alpha}\\rho+\\rho q^{\\beta}q^{\\alpha } -2q^{\\alpha}\\rho q^{\\beta}\\right),\\ ] ] which is known as the _ lindblad equation _ @xcite .",
    "it is a markovian master equation describing dissipative processes where quantum coherence is lost ; obviously @xmath34 . +",
    "an interesting question is which properties have to be satisfied by the couplings and operators to preserve the positivity of @xmath21 ; it will be discussed in section four .",
    "before a well - defined and accepted fundamental theory of physics is essentially modified , one should first try to analyse all possible alternatives to this modification .",
    "this is even more the case if this modification might lead to serious conflicts with other fundamental principles of physics .",
    "+ john preskill @xcite reviewed several approaches to the problem and gave arguments why all of these are no viable alternatives to information loss as reasoned by hawking .",
    "they will be presented in this section .",
    "the most obvious - and pragmatic - approach asserts that quantum effects could encode information in the outgoing radiation : the radiation could appear thermal initially , but be in fact correlated with the radiation emitted at later times .",
    "complete knowledge of all quanta emitted during the process would then suffice to recover the initial information , and no evolution of pure into mixed states would have to occur .",
    "the analogy given by @xcite is that of an encyclopaedia thrown into the sun ; the contained information is lost in practice by all means , but a complete measurement of all radiation emitted would _ in principle _ allow reconstruction of the encyclopaedia .",
    "the goal of this approach , of course , would be to describe the complete evolution by a unitary @xmath22 matrix .",
    "+   + there is a relatively simple argument ( apparently first given by susskind ) why this viewpoint violates causality : one can draw a spacelike surface @xmath35 that crosses the horizon , most of the outgoing radiation , and the collapsing body well inside the horizon .",
    "now assume the outgoing radiation is described by a pure state , so that unitarity is preserved ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , then the initial pure quantum state evolves into a tensor product @xmath36 but if two different states @xmath37 and @xmath38 evolve in this fashion , their superposition must evolve as @xmath39 which is only of the form @xmath40 if either @xmath41 and @xmath42 or @xmath43 and @xmath44 represent the same state .",
    "since the first case is ruled out , that means that all information gets stripped away from the infalling body as it crosses the horizon .",
    "must be a tensor product state . ]",
    "+   + indeed , the only possible way for information about a collapsing body to be encoded into radiation emitted at the event horizon that does not lead to a severe violation of causality is a mechanism that  keeps \" all information at or near the horizon . + any relativist would immediately dismiss this as a violation of the equivalence principle , as an infalling observer does not observe an event horizon and nothing peculiar should happen to him . +   + when presenting this argument , page tried to argue that in quantum gravity the causal structure might be different from the classical picture , so that it may be impossible to say that @xmath35 is definitely spacelike ( it must be nearly null classically ) and a tensor product structure can not be assumed @xcite .",
    "but even if one accepts this argument and can explain why this encoding of information does not appear in hawking s derivation , one still only has the choice between acausal propagation and the existence of some  bleaching \" mechanism .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that the semi - classical calculation breaks down when the black hole has almost radiated away , at least when it has shrunk down to planck size .",
    "one can assume that a black hole never radiates away completely because quantum effects stop the process , so that a stable remnant of ( presumably ) planck size remains .",
    "this remnant would then retain all information about the collapsing matter that formed the black hole , making it forever inaccessible .",
    "the description of the outgoing radiation by a mixed state would result from tracing over this inaccessible system",
    ". +   + at first glance , this seems to be a viable possibility",
    ". however it might be hard to imagine a planck size object containing an arbitrarily large amount of information , and it is here where problems start : the theory now contains an infinite number of different species of planck size objects . in a process like the evaporation of a large black hole , which could be described by an ",
    "effective field theory \" , there would be an amplitude for production of any of these species of planck size objects , presumably of order of the boltzmann factor @xmath45 - tiny for any large black hole , but still non - zero . if there is an infinite number of species , the total amplitude for remnant production would still be infinite , and one would expect an infinite luminosity .",
    "it might be argued that form factors suppress the creation of black hole remnants @xcite , or that an  effective field theory \" description does not have to be adequate in a quantum gravity process , as unruh and wald pointed out in a different context @xcite .",
    "+   + there is a second , possibly more convincing , argument against the existence of such remnants : the hawking - bekenstein entropy @xmath22 of a black hole is proportional to its surface area and thus to its mass squared .",
    "the postulated black hole remnants would therefore have a small entropy , completely uncorrelated with their information content , which could be arbitrarily large . to quote @xcite , ",
    "the beautiful edifice of black hole thermodynamics then seems like an inexplicable accident \" .",
    "the black hole entropy could in no way be interpreted as describing a number of internal states .",
    "+   + giddings proposed that a black hole might stop radiating away at a mass large compared to @xmath46 , depending on its information content , so that there could be arbitrarily large stable remnants for initially arbitrarily large black holes @xcite .",
    "although this would solve the two problems , preskill and page dismissed this proposal because it means that the semi - classical calculation supposedly breaks down at arbitrarily low spacetime curvature at the event horizon @xcite . it does not provide a serious alternative .",
    "+   + as a second , alternative possibility , it is also conceivable that all information might be encoded in the radiation emitted in the final stage of evaporation , when the black hole is of planck size ; black hole remnants would not be stable but decay .",
    "it would be natural to expect decaying rather than absolutely stable remnants , for there is no conservation law preventing their decay @xcite .",
    "+ since there is little energy left for a large amount of information to be transmitted , the remnant will take a long time to decay @xcite : if @xmath18 was the mass of black hole when it started evaporating , in the final stage there will be of order @xmath47 quanta needed to encode all the information .",
    "but the available energy is of order one , so every quantum will have an energy of order @xmath48 and therefore a wavelength of order @xmath16 .",
    "if these quanta are emitted  one at a time \" , the total time will be of order @xmath49 .",
    "according to @xcite , other authors even assumed an exponentially long time ; in any case , given that the time for evaporation is of order @xmath17 , there would be arbitrarily long - lived black hole remnants .",
    "one faces the same problems as if they were absolutely stable .",
    "the two approaches discussed so far are the alternatives to information loss most commonly found in all work on the subject .",
    "a few other ideas are also pursued : +   + firstly , anyone who believes in unitary evolution is challenged to explain how a black hole can record detailed information about any body that formed it .",
    "hawking radiation is thermal in semi - classical theory because a black hole has no  hair \" .",
    "however , bowick et al . showed that there may be additional charges carried by a black hole , referred to as  quantum hair \" @xcite .",
    "these are  axion charges \" that could supposedly be  detected by strings \" in an effect analogous to the aharonov - bohm effect @xcite .",
    "+ it is very hard to imagine that the existence of these charges might resolve the information loss paradox . as @xcite explained , one would need an infinite number of exactly conserved charges , arising from an infinite number of unbroken gauge symmetries , in order to record all information about an infalling body .",
    "this huge number of additional conservation laws should have significance for low - energy physics , where such charges have never been observed . + in @xcite the postulated existence of such charges",
    "was only used to state that a black hole can not completely evaporate since it will retain a large amount of charge for which there will be no decay channel .",
    "this is just a version of the proposal of stable remnants .",
    "+   + a second viewpoint was widely discussed by page and also by preskill @xcite : the lindblad equation is commonly used to describe open quantum systems , like a system that is in contact with a thermal bath .",
    "the apparent loss of quantum coherence then stems from the fact that only part of the complete system is accessible in measurements .",
    "one can therefore view the universe as an open system from which information can leave .",
    "indeed this is the explanation originally offered by hawking @xcite , who stated that  any reasonable theory of quantum gravity will allow closed universes to branch off from our nearly flat region of spacetime . \"",
    "a  superobserver \" who could measure the state of the whole  multiverse \" would observe unitary evolution @xcite .",
    "this viewpoint , however , merely serves as an explanation for why evolution of pure into mixed states might be observed .",
    "+ page even discussed the possibility of a universe that is open in both directions , so that states can come from and go to  baby universes \" .",
    "this general case would yield unpredictable mixed states .",
    "however , according to hawking it is only possible for information to leave , not enter our universe .",
    "+ exciting as ideas about a  multiverse \" may seem to be , they are disheartening because they do not explain what exactly happens inside a black hole @xcite .",
    "at least they provide a picture in which information is never  destroyed \" .",
    "+   + finally , one might also think about more drastic modifications of quantum mechanics , such as nonlinear evolution or the replacement of density matrices by something more fundamental @xcite .",
    "these seem to be far - fetched to most physicists ; furthermore , it is unclear how these proposals could help to resolve the paradox .",
    "various conceivable alternatives to information loss have been scrutinised , and all of them are plagued with serious inconsistencies .",
    "if one does not believe in a force at the event horizon that strips all information away from an infalling body , assumes that the classical picture of causality for a black hole is not completely overthrown by quantum effects , and likes to attach a possible interpretation to black hole entropy , then there seems to be no way to get around information loss .",
    "+   + one may choose to interpret information loss by  baby universes \" where information can go to from our universe , or one might adopt the ( more radical ? ) viewpoint that information is simply destroyed by a black hole singularity - it seems impossible to describe a process such as the formation and evaporation of a black hole without invoking non - unitarity in quantum mechanics .",
    "the relevant question is now whether or not it is possible to construct a sensible and consistent theory of quantum mechanics , starting from hawking s original proposals @xcite , that allows evolution from pure into mixed states and is not in conflict with other principles that are assumed valid . in their attempt to launch an attack on hawking s ideas , banks , peskin and susskind showed that assuming that there exists a differential equation that describes the evolution of @xmath21 which is local in time , the most general evolution equation is given by the lindblad equation @xcite .",
    "the following discussion assumes the lindblad equation in some form as the master equation describing non - unitary physics .",

    "the equation also needs to preserve positivity , i.e. the requirement that all ( real ) eigenvalues of @xmath21 be non - negative . +",
    "as shown in @xcite , this is the case if @xmath51 has only non - negative eigenvalues : diagonalise the hermitian matrix @xmath51 , which can be done by a unitary transformation @xmath52 , so that @xmath53 this means that @xmath54 identifying @xmath55 .",
    "@xmath21 may also be diagonalised , so that its diagonal elements are its eigenvalues @xmath56 .",
    "now assume that one of the eigenvalues of @xmath21 , say @xmath57 , becomes zero ; then in the evolution equation all terms but the last vanish , since @xmath58 for all @xmath59 , so that @xmath60 @xmath61 given that @xmath62 for all @xmath63 . by a similar calculation",

    "it was asserted that local dynamical evolution laws can describe the process .",
    "this section will turn back to these original assumptions ; they could both be incorrect in a complete theory of quantum gravity .",
    "one might have to look at black hole evaporation in a slightly different way .",
    "arkani - hamed et al .",
    "@xcite pointed out that if gravity is dynamical , the notion of local observables is not a well - defined concept .",

    "the physical validity of semi - classical arguments of the analysis was put in question by hawking @xcite , who argued that because the temperature and rate of emission of radiation of an evaporating black hole in this model remain finite the evaporation process must lead to a naked singularity if the approximation is trusted . in any case",
    "it is probably fair to say that a simplified two - dimensional model can not give more than indications that one is on the right track .",

    "+   + imposing such a principle , of course , does not give any indication of a dynamical process that might encode information in the outgoing radiation .",

    "building on black hole complementarity , hayden and preskill @xcite described a simple quantum information - theoretic model of how information could become scrambled in a black hole .",
    "their proposal was not meant to provide new conceptual insights , but showed how simple estimates might be misleading because one has to  classical \" a picture in mind .",
    "firstly , they assumed that , for a black hole composed of @xmath144 qubits , an instantaneous , randomly chosen unitary transformation  randomizes \" this information before the qubits get released in hawking radiation .",

    "thus , for an arbitrarily large black hole one can get arbitrarily close to ultimately retrieving all of the information thrown into the black hole ( keeping @xmath147 constant ) .",
    "as soon as the black hole has evaporated more than half of its original information content , information can be retrieved from the radiation .",
    "+   + this , of course , is a very simplified model , and even if one assumes black hole complementarity , leads to a contradiction : assume a black hole has already evaporated away more than half of its original information , and most of the outgoing radiation has been received by an observer outside of the black hole .",
    "a second observer could then fall into the black hole , sending off a message about his information before becoming almost instantly  randomized \" .",
    "the first observer , having retrieved this information through the following hawking radiation , could then follow into the black hole , receive the message and thus achieve some kind of quantum  cloning \" , which is not possible ( see fig .",
    ". this would violate the postulate that standard quantum mechanics can describe the process .",
    "+ to test if this problem is still present in a more realistic model , an estimate for the  thermalization time \" of a black hole was given in @xcite .",
    "one would normally assume that a perturbation of a black hole dies off within a time scale @xmath18 , since this is true classically , but only locally .",
    "using the dissipative properties that the proposed stretched horizon has , one obtains an estimate of @xmath148 ( measured in the schwarzschild time coordinate ) for the black hole to settle down to a quasi - stationary state , which was shown can be achieved by a model of efficient quantum circuits .",
    "+ one can then show @xcite that the proper time that the infalling observer has to send a message to the other observer is of order @xmath149 , where @xmath150 is the difference in schwarzschild time between the two observers crossing the horizon .",
    "since this must be at least equal to the thermalization time for the external observer to retrieve information while he is still outside of the horizon , the proper time left to send the message is at most of the order of the planck time , and in particular can not be increased by choosing @xmath18 to be large . since this means super - planckian frequencies",
    "are required , one would normally regard this as impossible , and cloning is (  just barely \" ) prevented .",
    "+   + from a quantum information theoretic perspective , such a randomization of the infalling information also means that no acausal signalling occurs in this process , and no mysterious  bleaching \" mechanism seems to be required . while the proposed model of hayden and preskill may look overly simplified to give insights into quantum gravity , it shows that information - theoretic reasoning can sometimes lead to very different conclusions than naively expected .",
    "it appears that the objections of section three could , at least in principle , be avoided .",
    "it was advocated in @xcite there there could be  an interesting middle ground \" between unitarity and information loss - the interpretation of this is somewhat unclear .",

    "it seems that to trust these ideas one has to accept string theory as a consistent theory of quantum gravity . +   + however , the ads / cft correspondence is a realisation of a more general principle .",
    "the result for the hawking - bekenstein entropy , namely that the entropy of a black hole is proportional to its surface area and not its volume , had led to the conjecture of the  holographic principle \" which states that a region with boundary of area @xmath151 is fully described by no more than @xmath152 degrees of freedom @xcite , since black holes have maximal entropy .",
