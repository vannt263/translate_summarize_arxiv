    "pigment - protein complexes ( ppcs ) play an important role in photosynthetically active biological systems and have been the subject of numerous experimental and theoretical studies @xcite . in a ppc",
    "the photoactive pigment molecules are held in well defined spatial configuration and orientation by a scaffold of proteins .",
    "the availability of high resolution crystal structure for a continuously growing number of ppcs provides a unique opportunity in better understanding their properties and function at atomic level .",
    "the spectral and optical properties of ppcs are determined by ( i ) the chemical nature of the pigment , ( ii ) the electronic interactions between the pigment molecules , and ( iii ) the interactions between pigment molecules and their environment ( e.g. , protein , lipid , solvent ) . since in biological systems",
    "ppcs exist and function at physiological temperature their electronic and optical properties are strongly affected by thermal fluctuations which represent the main source of dynamic disorder in these systems .",
    "unfortunately , even in the simplest theoretical models of ppcs the simultaneous treatment of the electronic coupling between the pigments and the effect of thermal disorder can be done only approximately @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to formulate and implement an efficient method for calculating spectral and optical properties , e.g. , linear absorption ( od ) and circular dichroism ( cd ) spectra of ppcs at finite temperature by using only atomic structure information . to demonstrate its usefulness , we apply the proposed method to calculate the od and cd spectra at room temperature of the aggregate of bacteriochlorophyll - a ( bchl - a ) molecules in the lh2 antenna complex from the purple bacterium _ rs .  molischianum_. following their crystal structure determination , lh2 complexes from _ rs .  molischianum _ @xcite and _ rsp .  acidophila _ @xcite have been extensively studied both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite . in _ rs .",
    "molischianum _ the lh2 is an octamer of @xmath0-heterodimers arranged in a ring - like structure @xcite .",
    "each protomer consists of an @xmath1- and a @xmath2-apoprotein which binds non - covalently one bchl - a molecule that absorbs at @xmath3  nm ( referred to as b800 ) , two bchl - a molecules that absorb at @xmath4  nm ( referred to as b850 ) and at least one carotenoid that absorbs around @xmath5  nm .",
    "the total of 16 b850 and 8 b800 bchls form two circular aggregates , both oriented parallel to the surface of the membrane .",
    "the excitonic coupling between the b800s is negligible because of their large spatial separation ( @xmath6   ) .",
    "therefore , the optically active q@xmath7 excited electronic states of the b800s are almost degenerate . on the other hand , the tightly packed b850s ( with and average mg@xmath8 mg distance of @xmath9   within the @xmath10heterodimer and @xmath11   between the neighboring protomers )",
    "are strongly coupled and the corresponding @xmath12 excited states form an excitonic band in which the states that carry most of the oscillator strength are clustered about @xmath13  nm ( @xmath14  ev ) .",
    "another important difference between the two bchl rings is that while the b800s are surrounded by mostly hydrophilic protein residues the binding pocket of the b850s is predominantly hydrophobic .",
    "@xcite thus , although both b800s and b850s are chemically identical bchl - a molecules their specific spatial arrangement and the nature of their immediate protein surrounding alter differently their spectral and optical properties .",
    "for example , it is quite surprising that the two peaks , due to the b800 and b850 bchls , in the experimental od spectrum of lh2 from _ rs .",

    ", novel methods for calculating optical spectra of ppcs by using computer simulations based entirely on the atomic structure of the system would not only provide a better understanding and interpretation of the existing experimental results but would also help in predicting and designing new experiments .",
    "the standard procedure to simulate the experimental spectra of lh2 systems ( and ppcs in general ) consists of two steps@xcite .",
    "first , the excitation energy spectrum is determined based on the static crystal structure of the system and , second , the corresponding stick spectrum is `` dressed up '' with simulated gaussian ( in case of static disorder ) and/or lorentzian ( in case of dynamic disorder ) line widths characterized by empirically ( and often self consistently ) determined parameters .",
    "alternatively , the spectral broadening of the stick spectrum can also be described through the coupling of the electronic excitations ( modeled as two- or multilevel - systems ) to a stochastic heat bath characterized by a model spectral density with empirical parameters . while either approach may yield excellent agreement between the simulated and experimental spectra",
    ", the empirical nature of the model parameters restricts their predictive power .",
    "our proposed method for calculating optical spectra is based on a combination of all atom molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations , quantum chemistry ( qc ) calculations , and quantum many - body theory .",
    "the conformational dynamics of the lh2 ring embedded into its natural environment ( a fully solvated lipid bilayer ) are followed by means of classical md simulations .",
    "next , for each bchl , modeled as a quantum two level system , the q@xmath7 excitation energy gap and transition dipole moment time series are determined along a properly chosen segment of the md trajectory by means of qc calculations .",
    "finally , the od and cd spectra are determined as weighted sums of the fourier transform of the quantum dipole - dipole correlation function ( i.e. , the absorption _ lineshape function _ ) which , within the cumulant approximation , can be calculated from the sole knowledge of the energy gap time series . formally , this method can also be regarded as a two step procedure .",
    "first , a stick spectrum is generated from the average values of the energy gap time series and , second , spectral broadening is applied through the corresponding lineshape function weighted by the mean transition dipole ( rotational ) strength in the case of od ( cd ) spectrum . since both the peak position and the broadening of the optical spectrum are obtained from the same energy gap time series determined from combined md / qc calculations , the proposed method requires no empirical fitting parameters making it ideal for predicting optical spectra for ppcs with known structure .",
    "similar md / qc methods were used previously by @xcite for calculating the od spectrum of bchl - a in methanol , and by @xcite to determine the od and cd spectra of b850s in lh2 from _ rs .",
    "molischianum_. the relationship between these studies and the present one will be established below .",

    "in order to calculate the linear optical absorption of a ppc we assume that the electronic properties of individual pigment molecules can be described in terms of a two - level system , formed by the ground state and the lowest excited singlet state ( e.g. , the q@xmath7 state in the case of bchl - a ) involved in the optical absorption process . neglecting for the moment the direct interaction between the pigments ( e.g. , by assuming a sufficiently large spatial separation between them as in the case of the b800s in lh2 ) , we denote these two states for the @xmath16 pigment ( @xmath17 ) as @xmath18 and @xmath19 and @xmath20 and @xmath21 specify the state of the @xmath16 pigment on the ground- and excited - state potential energy surface , respectively . because the exact quantum mechanical treatment of the eigenstates @xmath22 , @xmath23 and of the corresponding energy eigenvalues @xmath24 , @xmath25 is not feasible , usually the quantum numbers @xmath26 and @xmath21 are associated with the vibronic states of the ppc that can be treated within the harmonic approximation . here",
    "we follow a different approach in which the dynamics of the nuclear degrees of freedom of the ppc are described by all - atom md simulations , and the energy gap time series @xmath27 is calculated at each md time step by qc calculations as described below .",
    "the main assumption of this approach is that the obtained energy gap time series @xmath28 can be used to calculate approximately equilibrium quantities ( such as energy gap density of states and time autocorrelation functions ) of the original system without the knowledge of the exact energy gap spectrum @xmath29 .    in the absence of the excitonic coupling between the pigment molecules ,",
    "the hamiltonian of the system can be written as @xmath30 , where    [ eq : h0-hn ] @xmath31 and @xmath32    the dipole moment operator through which the incident light field couples to the @xmath16 pigment is given by    [ eq : tdm ] @xmath33 where the transition dipole moment ( tdm ) matrix element @xmath34 in the condon approximation @xcite can be written @xmath35    here @xmath36 is the real tdm vector whose time series can be determined from the same combined md / qc calculations as @xmath28 .",

    ".    when the size of the ppc is much smaller than the wavelength of the light field , in leading approximation the latter can be regarded as homogeneous throughout the system and , according to standard linear response theory , the corresponding od spectrum is proportional to the dipole - dipole correlation function @xmath39,\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the @xmath41 component of the time dependent electric dipole operator , and @xmath42 with @xmath43 the usual temperature factor and @xmath44 the corresponding partition function . to simplify notation , throughout this paper we use units in which @xmath45 , and apply the convention of implicit summation over repeated vector indices . by employing eqs .  - , after some algebra , the quantum dipole correlation function in eq .",
    "can be expressed as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the kronecker delta . by inserting eq .   into eq .",
    "one obtains the sought od spectrum of an aggregate of noninteracting pigments in their native environment    [ eq : iw0 ] @xmath48 where the _ lineshape function _ is defined as @xmath49    the main difficulty in calculating the quantum time correlation function in eq .",
    "is due to the fact that the hamiltonians @xmath50 and @xmath51 do not commute .",
    "if they would , then the lineshape function could be expressed in terms of the energy gap density of states ( dos ) . indeed , in this case @xmath52 , with @xmath53 , and by calculating the time integral in eq .",
    "would follow    [ eq : a - n ] @xmath54    where the density of states @xmath55 is approximated by the binned histogram of the energy gap fluctuations @xmath28 obtained from combined md / qc calculations .",
    "in general , eqs .   overestimate the broadening of the lineshape function .",
    "indeed , the fourier transform of the exact spectral representation of the correlation function    [ eq : aw - s ] @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the statistical matrix of the electronic ground state , yields @xmath58    which can be regarded as a franck - condon weighted and thermally averaged density of state@xcite . by setting the franck - condon factors @xmath59 equal to unity in one obtains eqs .  .",
    "since it is not possible to determine all these factors , it is often convenient to use eqs .",
    "as a rough estimate of @xmath60 for calculating the od spectrum .",
    "a systematic way of calculating the correlation function in is the cumulant expansion method .",

    "one can determine both the spectral density and the imaginary part of the quantum correlation function , i.e. , @xmath73 and @xmath74 thus , the lineshape function within the second cumulant approximation is    [ eq : a - phi - varphi ] @xmath75 , \\ ] ] where the broadening and frequency shift functions are given by [ eq : phi - varphi ] @xmath76 and @xmath77    a straightforward extension of the above method for calculating the lineshape function and the od spectrum of @xmath78 excitonically coupled pigment molecules would require the determination of the energies @xmath79 and tdms @xmath80 corresponding to the excitonic states @xmath81 , @xmath82 .",
    "unfortunately , the required qc calculations ( by considering all @xmath78 pigments as a single quantum system ) are still prohibitively expensive computationally .",

    "one obtains the desired od spectrum of the excitonic system @xmath97 where @xmath98 we note that by replacing the site index @xmath89 with the excitonic index @xmath99 most of the above results for noninteracting pigments remain formally valid for the corresponding excitonic system as well . for example ,",
    "similar expressions to and can be easily derived for estimating @xmath100 .    to conclude this section we derive an expression for the cd spectrum of the ppc . by definition , the cd spectrum @xmath101 is the difference between @xmath102 and @xmath103 , the od spectra for left and right circularly polarized light , respectively .",
    "unlike in the case of the od spectrum , the calculation of @xmath101 even within the leading order approximation requires taking into account the spatial variation of the light field across the ppc as well as the excitonic coupling between the pigment molecules regardless how small this may be .",

    "after energy minimization , the system was subjected to a @xmath122  ns long equilibration in the npt ensemble@xcite at normal temperature ( @xmath123  k ) and pressure ( @xmath124  atm ) , using periodic boundary conditions and treating the full long - range electrostatic interactions by the pme method@xcite .",

    "the level of approximation used is determined by : ( i ) the actual definition of the optically active _ quantum system _ , i.e. , the part of the system that is responsible for light absorption and needs to be treated quantum mechanically ; ( ii ) the actual choice of the qc method used in the calculations ; and ( iii ) the particular way in which the effect of the ( classical ) environment on the quantum system is taken into account in the qc calculations .",
    "because the optical properties of bchls are determined by the cyclic conjugated @xmath131-electron system of the macrocycle the quantum system was restricted to a truncated structure of the bchl - a containing 49 atoms in the porphyrin plane .",
    "the truncation consisted in removing the phytyl tail and in replacing the terminal ch@xmath132 and ch@xmath133ch@xmath132 groups on the macrocycle with h atoms in order to satisfy valence requirements .",
    "similar truncation schemes have been employed previously@xcite . in these studies the phytyl tail of the bchls was removed but the number of atoms retained in the optically active macrocycle was different .",
    "for example , @xcite in calculating the excited states of the b800 octamer and the b850 hexadecamer of lh2 from _ rs .",
    "molischianum _ used 44 macrocycle atoms , while @xcite in calculating the absorption spectrum of bchl - a in ethanol used 84 atoms . according to the crystal structure @xcite , the b800 and b850 bchls in lh2 from _ rs .",
    "molischianum _ differ only in the length of their phytyl chain , having a total of 107 and 140 atoms , respectively .",
    "the removal of the phytyl tail reduces dramatically both the size of the quantum system and the corresponding qc computational time . furthermore , for the truncated bchls",
    "the non trivial task of automatic identification of the q@xmath7 excited state in the case of a large number of such computations becomes easier and more precise .",
    "although in general the different truncation schemes yield excitation energy time series with somewhat different ( shifted ) mean values , the corresponding energy fluctuations , which play the chief role in calculating the optical absorption properties of ppc at room temperature in their native environment , are less sensitive to the actual size of the truncated pigment .",
    "corresponding to the @xmath134 b850 excitonic states .",
    "both @xmath135 and the corresponding error bars are expressed relative to the mean dipole moment of individual b850s.,width=288 ]    the @xmath12 excitations of the truncated bchls were calculated by using zerner s semiempirical intermediate neglect of differential overlap method parametrized for spectroscopy ( zindo / s ) within the single - point configuration interaction singles ( cis ) approximation @xcite . because it is much faster and more accurate than most of the computationally affordable _ ab initio _ qc methods ( e.g. , the hartree - fock ( hf ) cis method with the minimal sto-3g@xmath136 basis set ) , zindo / s cis has been extensively used in the literature to compute low lying optically allowed excited states of pigment molecules @xcite . in cases like ours , where thousands of qc calculations are required , the proper balancing between speed and accuracy is absolutely essential .",
    "to further increase the computational speed , the active orbital space for the cis calculations was restricted to the ten highest occupied ( homo ) and the ten lowest unoccupied ( lumo ) molecular orbitals . according to previous studies @xcite , as well as our own testings , the choice of a larger active space has negligible effect on the computed q@xmath7 states .",
    "our zindo / s calculations were carried out with the qc program packages hyperchem@xcite and gaussian  98@xcite . in each calculation only the lowest four excited states were determined . only in a small fraction ( @xmath137 ) of cases",
    "was the indentification of the q@xmath7 excited state ( characterized by the largest oscillator strength and corresponding to transitions homo@xmath138lumo and homo-1@xmath138lumo+1 ) problematic requiring careful inspection .",
    "we have found that even in such cases the q@xmath7 state had the largest projection of the tdm along the @xmath139-axis , determined by the @xmath140 and @xmath141 nitrogen atoms .",
    "the effect of the environment on the quantum system was taken into account through the electric field created by the partial point charges of the environment atoms , including those bchl atoms that were removed during the truncation process .",
    "thus , the dynamics of the nuclear degrees of freedom ( described by md simulation ) have a two - fold effect on the fluctuations of the q@xmath7 state , namely they lead to : ( 1 ) conformational fluctuation of the ( truncated ) bchls , and ( 2 ) a fluctuating electric field created by the thermal motion of the corresponding atomic partial charges . in order to assess the relative importance of these two effects the time series @xmath28 were calculated both in the the presence and in the absence of the point charges .",

    "the obtained time series are used to evaluate within the second cumulant approximation the optical lineshape functions as the fourier transform of the quantum dipole - dipole correlation function .",

    "the broadening of the b850 peak is due to the sizable excitonic coupling between these bchls .",
