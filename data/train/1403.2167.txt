    "the hadron internal structure is presently encoded , thanks to the qcd factorisation theorem , in process - independent parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) . the latter allow to predict cross sections for high - mass systems and high transverse - momentum jets in hadronic collisions in terms of binary partonic interactions .",
    "there are , however , increasing experimental evidences ( for recent analyses see ref .",
    "@xcite ) that hard double parton scattering ( dps ) may occur within the same hadronic collision .",
    "the experimental and theoretical efforts to identify and quantify dps contributions aim to understand and control this additional qcd background in new physics searches , especially in the multi - jet channel . at a more fundamental level ,",
    "dps could unveil parton correlations in the hadron structure not accessible in single parton scattering ( sps ) and encoded in novel distributions , _",

    "so far , measuraments have only provided informations on @xmath0 .",
    "this dimensionful parameter controls the magnitudo of dps contribution under the simplifying assumptions of two uncorrelated hard scatterings and full factorisation of dpds in terms of ordinary pdfs and model - dependent distribution in transverse position space .",
    "many theoretical analyses have predicted qcd evolution effects on dpds relaxing some or all the above assumptions  @xcite .",
    "a part recent progress in this direction reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , the experimental observation of the expected mild scaling violations induced by dpds evolution is not yet possible given the accuracy of the present data . nonetheless , a good theoretical control of the latter is mandatory if the whole dps formalism has to be properly validated against data .",
    "a first attempt to calculate the scale dependence of longitudinal dpds ( hereafter called ldpds ) has been presented long ago in ref .",
    "@xcite under the assumption of factorisation in transverse space . with respect to standard single - parton distributions  @xcite",
    ", ldpds evolution equations do contain an additional term which is responsable for perturbative longitudinal correlation between the interacting partons .",
    "this result has stimulated in the recent past an increasing activity in the field and has generated some constructive criticism in the literature .",
    "a first critical point is that the relative transverse momentum of the interacting parton pair is not conserved between amplitude and its conjugated  @xcite .",
    "this implies that one should consider new distributions , addressed as two - particle generalised parton distributions , @xmath1 , which have an additional dependence on a transverse momentum vector @xmath2 which parametrises this imbalance  @xcite .",
    "they reduce to ldpds addressed in this paper when this vector is set to zero or , in position space , if they are integrated over the relative distance @xmath3 of the parton pair .",
    "this additional dependence affects the evolution of the correlated and uncorrelated terms in rather different way  @xcite and give rise to inconsistencies with respect to the formalism of refs .",

    "i.e. _ longitudinal dpds , and moreover the integral over the imbalance @xmath2 of the product of @xmath1 is directly proportional to the value of @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "a second critical point is that the inclusion of single splitting contributions , according to the formalism of ref .",

    "@xcite is crucial if one demands that longitudinal dpds satisfie qcd consistency check for the momentum sum rule .",

    "this fact has induced us to reconsider in more detail the kinematics of the branching at the basis of the inhomogeneous term .",
    "we first note that a physically plausible scale characterising the parton branching in the inhomogeneous term could be identified with the relative transverse momentum squared , @xmath99 , between the daughter partons , rather than the generic @xmath20 scale .",
    "this scale choice ambiguity can be resolved only within a higher order calculation .",
    "we can easily calculate this quantity considering a generic branching @xmath100 , where we have explictely indicated longitudinal momentum fractions , transverse momenta and space - like virtualities of the relevant partons . by performing a sudakov decomposition of the four - momenta and setting @xmath101 with @xmath102 , it is then easy to show ( see appendix  [ deco ] ) that @xmath103 where , in our notation , the fractional momentum @xmath104 is simply given by @xmath105 .",
