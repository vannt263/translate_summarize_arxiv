    "<S> selectively excited photoluminescence ( spl ) of an array of self - organized in@xmath0ga@xmath0as quantum dots has been measured in a magnetic field up to 11 t . </S>",
    "<S> anomalous magnetic field sensitivity of the spl spectra has been observed under conditions for which the regular photoluminescence spectra is insensitive to the magnetic field due to large inhomogeneous broadening . </S>",
    "<S> the anomalous sensitivity is interpreted in terms of the repulsion of excited levels of the dots in a random potential . a theory presented to describe this phenomena is in excellent agreement with the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> the data estimated the correlation in the positions of excited levels of the dots to be 94% . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic field dependence allows the determination of the reduced cyclotron effective mass in a dot . for our sample </S>",
    "<S> we have obtained @xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> an array of self - organized quantum dots ( qds ) is a unique system consisting of very small atomic - like objects each with a few energy levels@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the studies of this system have shown the possibility to attain three - dimensional confinement of carriers within qds . </S>",
    "<S> such quantum dots are formed in highly strained semiconductor heterostructures by what is known as stranski - krastanow growth , where growth starts two - dimensionally , but after a certain critical thickness is reached , islands are formed spontaneously , and a thin wetting layer is left under the islands . in this process , the growth is interrupted immediately after the formation of the islands and before strain relaxation and misfit dislocations occur . </S>",
    "<S> such in - situ formation of 0d quantum dots results in high quality defect - free materials . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the coherent islanding and strain effects can produce qds with a size uniformity within @xmath210% which is very promising for 0d quantum devices where the sharper density of states is exploited .    </S>",
    "<S> photoluminescence ( pl ) spectrum of such an array has a broad line which is supposed to be mainly due to inhomogeneous broadening@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> photoluminescence excitation ( ple ) and selectively - excited photoluminescence ( spl ) reveal a fine structure . </S>",
    "<S> this fine structure has been interpreted by one of us@xcite as a result of splitting of the excited levels in quantum dots due to violation of cylindrical symmetry of the dots by a random potential . though the splitting is much less than the pl linewidth , it can be observed because of the effect of repulsion of energy levels inside a dot . </S>",
    "<S> here we give an experimental proof of this point and a detailed study of the level repulsion in quantum dots by applying magnetic field which affects the splitting of excited levels .    </S>",
    "<S> we found an anomalous sensitivity of the spl to a magnetic field under conditions for which the regular photoluminescence spectra is insensitive to the magnetic field due to large inhomogeneous broadening . we show that this sensitivity is a direct result of the level repulsion . </S>",
    "<S> a preliminary discussion of this effect has been given earlier@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the dot layer studied here is pseudomorphically grown by mbe on ( 100 ) gaas substrate , and the qds are formed by the coherent relaxation into islands of a few monolayers ( ml ) of in@xmath0ga@xmath0as between gaas buffer and cap layers . </S>",
    "<S> the actual amount of indium incorporated in the dots can differ due to the complex dynamics of the adatoms during island formation . </S>",
    "<S> the growth and qd structural details have been reported earlier@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) shows ple and regular pl spectra . </S>",
    "<S> regular pl reveals a broad line with the fwhm=57mev . </S>",
    "<S> ple spectra consists of significantly narrower lines . </S>",
    "<S> pl spectrum is red - shifted with respect to ple by about 80 mev . </S>",
    "<S> this shift occurs since the ple experiment detects the light emitted only by the levels below the level excited by the pumping light .    </S>",
    "<S> the spl spectra for different excitation energies are presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) </S>",
    "<S> . the complicated character of the spl spectra were analyzed earlier@xcite . for our purposes </S>",
    "<S> it is important that at some energy of excitation ( @xmath3ev ) the spl spectrum shows two symmetric peaks . at larger and smaller @xmath4 </S>",
    "<S> these peaks become asymmetric .    for an intuitive picture </S>",
    "<S> it is helpful to assume that each dot has two optically active excited levels @xmath5 relatively close to each other ( see fig .  2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dots are isolated from each other , so the light is emitted from the same dot it is absorbed to . </S>",
    "<S> the dots are excited into @xmath6 or @xmath7 and , after thermalization , emit light from @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the red shift mentioned above originates from the difference @xmath9 . in some dots </S>",
    "<S> the excitation energy @xmath10 may be close either to @xmath7 or to @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> these two types of dots can be considered as two different subsets . </S>",
    "<S> these subsets should give two peaks in the spl curve if we assume the correlation between the positions of @xmath5 and @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> if this correlation is of such kind that the dots with larger @xmath5 have , in general , larger @xmath8 , the excitation of @xmath6 will cause the lower peak in spl . </S>",
    "<S> this is a natural proposal and it corresponds to our experimental data ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> at some energy of excitation there are the same amounts of dots in each subset . however , </S>",
    "<S> if the energy of excitation is shifted upward , the number of the dots which have the lowest excited level at this energy is smaller , so the intensity of the higher - energy peak decreases . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly , the low - energy peak disappears as the excitation energy decreases .    in our interpretation two </S>",
    "<S> close optically active excited levels originate from the doubly degenerate lowest excited level of a cylindrically symmetric dot . </S>",
    "<S> these levels are split by a random potential which may include a deviation of a dot shape from cylindrical symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> it is crucial that both the distance between the peaks and their width , as well as the linewidth of the nonselective pl have the same origin . </S>",
    "<S> they are determined by the random potential which splits degenerate levels and shifts randomly all energy levels in qds .    at the excitation energy @xmath3ev , which gives two symmetric peaks in the spl , </S>",
    "<S> we have studied the magnetic field dependence of the spl spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the results presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 show anomalous sensitivity to the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the relative intensity of the dip between two peaks decreases by 11% in the magnetic field of 2 t . </S>",
    "<S> note that the wide line of the regular ( non - selective ) pl is insensitive to a magnetic field up to @xmath1110t@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we show below that the two - level structure of spl at zero field and its anomalous sensitivity to the magnetic field are both the results of the level repulsion .    for an axially symmetric dot two degenerate wave functions with an angular momentum @xmath12 have the form @xmath13 , where @xmath14 can be chosen real . </S>",
    "<S> for the first excited state @xmath15 . </S>",

    "<S> it can be caused by alloy fluctuations . in principle </S>",
    "<S> , the same description is also valid in the case when the cylindrical symmetry is violated by strain field or shape of the dots@xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> the ple and spl lineshapes can be obtained from this function by fixing corresponding variables . </S>",

    "<S> the lowest state @xmath8 with the wave function @xmath42 is also shifted by random potential by    @xmath43    the shift @xmath39 is also a gaussian random variable which is statistically independent of @xmath22 and @xmath23 , however , in general , it is correlated with @xmath18 .    </S>",

    "<S> the effect of level repulsion manifests itself in spl and in ple in full scale if the overall shift of @xmath5 is proportional to the shift of @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> this means @xmath57 . in this case </S>",
    "<S> we get    @xmath58    where @xmath59 is the distribution function of splittings given by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ f ] ) .    the ple lineshape can be obtained from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ rho1 ] ) by fixing the detection energy @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that it is just given by the function @xmath59 . to get spl lineshape one should fix @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> the lineshape of the spl also reproduces the features of the function @xmath59 . because of the level repulsion both spl and ple </S>",
    "<S> are zero when @xmath60 . in the magnetic field </S>",
    "<S> they are zero in the range @xmath61 .    if the fluctuations of the lowest and the next excited states were uncorrelated , the structure will be substantially smeared . </S>",

    "<S> the experimental value we obtain below is @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> this coefficient describes the correlation in positions of the lowest excited level @xmath8 and the next split excited level @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath49 close to 1 suggests that a substantial part of the fluctuations originates from the change of the size of the dots which shifts energy levels proportionally . </S>",
    "<S> that is why such a tiny effect as the repulsion of split levels makes spl spectra very sensitive to a relatively weak magnetic field .    </S>",

    "<S> two dimensionless parameters , @xmath49 and @xmath64 , are obtained from the relative depth of the dip in spl and the shift of ple maxima with detection energy as provided by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ p ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this gives @xmath63 and @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> the absolute value of @xmath24 can be found from the relative peak position at zero field , which gives @xmath66mev and @xmath67mev . to check the consistency , </S>",
    "<S> we can obtain @xmath45 from the width of the non - selective pl in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) . assuming the gaussian shape of pl , the fwhm=57mev gives @xmath68mev .    with these parameters given , </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic - field dependence of both the relative depth of the dip and the relative peak position depend only on the effective mass . </S>",
    "<S> the value @xmath69 gives perfect fit for both quantities as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4 .    the value of the effective mass we obtained can be understood by taking into account that the cyclotron frequency that enters eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ matr ] ) contains the reduced effective mass for the electron and hole , @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> if we assume @xmath71 , our result would imply @xmath72 . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> if we take for the effective mass of the electron the value for bulk ga@xmath0in@xmath0as , @xmath73@xcite , the value of @xmath69 would give for the mass of the hole @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> the small value of the hole mass is natural taking into account the two - dimensional nature of the qds . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the effects of strain and confinement are believed to increase the effective mass of the carriers with respect to the bulk material@xcite .    in conclusion , we have observed anomalous sensitivity of spl to the magnetic field low enough to affect the regular pl spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we interpret such sensitivity in terms of the repulsion of energy levels in qds caused by a random potential . </S>",
    "<S> we present a theory which describes the phenomenon and shows excellent agreement with the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> the data allows to determine the correlation in the positions of excited levels the reduced cyclotron effective mass for the carriers in the dots . </S>"
