    "the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) remains an unsettled central problem in particle physics .",
    "no clear experimental signal has emerged yet which point towards a specific physical description of ewsb .",
    "the higgs boson has not been found , nor any supersymmetric particle , which , as believed by many , could play a crucial role in triggering ewsb . similarly",
    "any possible mechanism of dynamical ewsb , if realized , is at least well hidden in the relevant data so far .",
    "this is where we stand at the moment .",
    "it is very likely , on the other hand , that the progression of the upgraded tevatron runs and , especially , the coming in operation of lhc will change the situation in this decade , making available crucial data on the physics of ewsb .",
    "all this motivates further thoughts on this problem .    where to look for an orientation , however ? theoretically , the quadratic divergence of the higgs mass in the standard model ( sm ) remains a crucial aspect of ewsb .",
    "this is neither new , however , nor sufficiently discriminating among alternative theoretical ideas .",
    "more significant , maybe , is the impressive series of electroweak precision tests ( ewpt ) performed in the nineties mostly at lep but also at the tevatron and at slc .",
    "as well known , these data brilliantly confirm the sm at the level of the pure electroweak radiative corrections .",
    "although indirectly , this suggests that any drastic departure from the sm can not occur , if it does at all , below a few .",
    "furthermore , always indirectly , an evidence emerges from the same data in favor of a light higgs in the hundred range . here",
    "we stick to this interpretations of the ewpt , not unavoidable but plausible : there is indeed a light higgs , close to the direct lower bound of about 110 , while physics remains perturbative up to 2 - 3 energies at least .",
    "this view would have a problem , however , if we also supposed , at the same time , that no new weakly interacting particle were present below the cut off scale @xmath0 , at or above 2 - 3 . the dominant radiative correction to the higgs mass , from the top loop , cut - off at @xmath0 would in fact be ( @xmath1 is the fermi constant and @xmath2 the top mass ) : @xmath3 at least about @xmath4 times bigger than the supposed physical higgs squared mass . the usual hierarchy problem , coupled with",
    "the knowledge of the top mass , has acquired a `` low energy '' aspect .",
    "we underline that this was not the case , a decade ago , when the ewpt were not available and the top mass was not known .",
    "given the special role of lep in the ewpt , one can call this the `` lep paradox '' @xcite .",
    "all this sounds pretty familiar as an argument in favor of the existence of superpartners , and maybe it is . with the introduction of the loops of the stop , of mass @xmath5 , ( [ eq : corr - mh - top ] )",
    "turns into : @xmath6 still divergent , but only logarithmically .",
    "the stop and the other superpartners might exist then , but where ?",
    "it is in the very spirit of this entire argument that the correction ( [ eq : corr - mh - top / stop ] ) and the other contributions to @xmath7 should not exceed significantly the @xmath8 range without an accidental tuning among the different parameters involved . in turn , by inspection of definite supersymmetric extensions of the sm , this has led to the expectation that some superpartner , as the higgs itself , had to be discovered , in particular , at lep , which did not happen .",
    "since this was an expectation and not a theorem , the failure to find supersymmetry at lep is not of immediate interpretation either . with some amount of tuning in the space of parameters , standard superpartners , with masses close to the current lower bounds , can certainly exist , ready to be found at the upgraded tevatron and/or at lhc .",
    "the success of gauge coupling unification supports this view . on the bad side , however , by allowing an increasing amount of tuning , all superpartners could escape detection even at lhc .",
    "all this justifies , in our opinion , the exploration of alternative possibilities : we seek a model with a naturally light higgs , in the 100 region , perturbative up to a few at least and with a structure in between possibly determined in terms of a minimum number of parameters .",
