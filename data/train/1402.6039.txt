    "strongly correlated phenomena in controllable quantum many - body systems have attracted great attention in optical lattices @xcite and josephson - junction arrays @xcite .",

    "these features , together with progress in realizing the strong light - matter coupling regime in both atomic and solid - state systems @xcite , are attracting more and more attention to the quantum phase transitions in coupled - cavity arrays captured by the jch model .",
    "these quantum phase transitions are due to the transfer of excitations from polaritonic states to photonic states , where polaritons are superpositions of photons and excitations of the atoms or atom - like structures , rather than purely bosonic or purely fermionic excitations .",
    "most previous studies related to quantum phase transitions in coupled - cavity arrays have focused on the large site number and large atom number limits @xcite , which are analogous to the purely bosonic bh model and can be analytically solved within the mean - field approximation .",

    "it is known that the number of photons plays an important role in the coefficient of on - site repulsion for small finite systems @xcite , but the influence of extra photons on the quantum phase transition in the lowest energy state of the coupled atom - cavity system is still unclear .    in this work ,",
    "we investigate quantum phase transition - like behavior in the lowest energy state ( within the @xmath2-excitation hilbert subspace ) of a two - site coupled atom - cavity system , where each cavity contains one atom but the total excitation number @xmath2 is not limited to two .",

    "<S> we analyze the quantum phase transition - like behavior in the lowest energy state of a two - site coupled atom - cavity system , where each cavity contains one atom but the total excitation number is not limited to two . utilizing the variance of the total excitation number to distinguish the insulator and superfluid states , and the variance of the atomic excitation number to identify the polaritonic characteristics of these states , we find that the total excitation number plays a significant role in the lowest - energy - state phase transitions . in both the small hopping regime and the small atom - field interaction regime , we identify an interesting coexisting phase involving characteristics of both photonic superfluid and atomic insulator . for small </S>",
    "<S> hopping , we find that the signature of the photonic superfluid state becomes more pronounced with the increase in total excitation number , and that the boundaries of the various phases shift with respect to the case of @xmath0 . in the limit of small atom - field interaction , the polaritonic superfluid region becomes broader as the total excitation number increases . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the variance of the total excitation number in a single site has a linear dependence on the total excitation number in the large - detuning limit . </S>"
