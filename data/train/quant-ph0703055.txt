    "the theory of open quantum systems addresses the problems of damping and dephasing in quantum systems by its assertion that all real systems of interest are in fact ` open ' systems , each surrounded by its environment .",
    "quantum optics provided one of the first testing grounds for the application of the formalism of open quantum systems @xcite .",
    "application of open system ideas to other areas of physics was intensified by the works of caldeira and leggett @xcite , and zurek @xcite among others .",
    "most such studies are based on a model describing quantum brownian motion of a simple harmonic oscillator in a harmonic oscillator environment .",
    "in such a model studied by caldeira and leggett @xcite , the coordinate of the particle was coupled linearly to the harmonic oscillator reservoir , and it was also assumed that the system and the environment were initially separable .",
    "the treatment of the quantum brownian motion has since been generalized to the physically reasonable initial condition of a mixed state of the system and its environment by hakim and ambegaokar @xcite , smith and caldeira @xcite , grabert , schramm and ingold @xcite , and by us for the case of a system in a stern - gerlach potential @xcite , and also for the quantum brownian motion with nonlinear system - environment couplings @xcite .",
    "the recent upsurge of interest in the problem of open quantum systems is because of the spectacular progress in manipulation of quantum states of matter ( atoms , or bosonic or fermionic gases or molecules ) , encoding , transmission and processing of quantum information , for all of which understanding and control of the environmental impact are essential . for such open quantum systems",
    ", there exists an important class of energy - preserving measurements in which dephasing occurs without damping of the system .",
    "this may be achieved with a particular type of coupling between the system and its environment , viz .",
    ", when the hamiltonian @xmath0 of the system commutes with the hamiltonian @xmath1 describing the system - reservoir interaction , i.e. , @xmath1 is a constant of motion generated by @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this condition describes a particular type of quantum nondemolition ( qnd ) measurement scheme .    in general , a class of observables that may be measured repeatedly with arbitrary precision , with the influence of the measurement apparatus on the system being confined strictly to the conjugate observables ,",
    "is called qnd or back - action evasive observables @xcite .",
    "such a measurement scheme was originally introduced in the context of the detection of gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "the experimental progress on qnd measurements has been summarized in the review @xcite and the dynamics of decoherence in continuous atom - optical qnd measurements studied in @xcite .",
    "in addition to its relevance in ultrasensitive measurements , a qnd scheme provides a way to prepare quantum mechanical states which may otherwise be difficult to create , such as fock states with a specific number of particles .",
    "it has been shown that the accuracy of atomic interferometry can be improved by using qnd measurements of the atomic populations at the inputs to the interferometer @xcite .",
    "qnd systems have also been proposed for engineering quantum dynamical evolution of a system with the help of a quantum meter @xcite .",
    "we have recently studied such qnd open system hamiltonians for two different models of the environment describable as baths of either oscillators or spins , and found an interesting connection between the energy - preserving qnd hamiltonians and the phase space area - preserving canonical transformations @xcite .    as stated above , in the context of energy - preserving qnd systems , the only effect of the environment on the system is dephasing and it is a natural question to ask about the pattern of diffusion of ` phases ' in such a situation .",
    "such a question is particularly relevant in the context of a number of practical phase measurement schemes @xcite .    what is the precise meaning of the quantum mechanical phase ?",
    "the quantum description of phases @xcite has a long history @xcite .",
    "pegg and barnett @xcite , following dirac @xcite , carried out a polar decomposition of the annihilation operator and defined a hermitian phase operator in a finite - dimensional hilbert space . in their scheme ,",
    "the expectation value of a function of the phase operator is first carried out in a finite - dimensional hilbert space , and then the dimension is taken to the limit of infinity . however , it is not possible to interpret this expectation value as that of a function of a hermitian phase operator in an infinite - dimensional hilbert space @xcite . to circumvent this problem , the concept of phase distribution for the quantum phase",
    "has been introduced @xcite . in this scheme ,",
    "one associates a phase distribution to a given state such that the average of a function of the phase operator in the state , computed with the phase distribution , reproduces the results of pegg and barnett .    in this paper",
    "we address the problem of quantum phase diffusion and study the dynamics of the quantum phase distribution associated with the reduced density matrix of the system for a number of situations of practical importance , as the system evolves under the influence of its environment with an energy - preserving qnd coupling .",
    "one may take the system to be either an oscillator ( harmonic or anharmonic ) or a two - level atom ( or equivalently , a spin-1/2 system ) .",
    "the phase distributions associated with the quantum state for the two cases are defined .",
    "the environment is modeled as a bath of harmonic oscillators , and the impact of the environmental parameters is quantified for different initial states of the system .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we briefly discuss a generic energy - preserving qnd system in the context of open systems @xcite .",
    "the bath is taken to be initially in a squeezed thermal state , from which the common thermal bath results may be easily extracted by setting the squeezing parameters to zero . in section iii , we define the phase distribution for an oscillator system , following agarwal _",
    "_ @xcite . in section iiia in particular",
    ", we consider a harmonic oscillator system in qnd interaction with its environment @xcite .",
    "we study two different initial conditions , of the system starting ( 1 ) in a coherent state and ( 2 ) in a squeezed coherent state . in section iiib , we study the case where the system is an anharmonic oscillator , which could arise , for example , from the interaction of a single mode of the quantized electromagnetic field with a kerr medium @xcite .",
    "this hamiltonian can be expressed in terms of the generators of the group su(1,1 ) . using the positive discrete series representation of this group ,",
    "we construct its phase distribution and study it for two different situations : ( 1 ) when the system is initially in a kerr state , and ( 2 ) when it is initially in a squeezed kerr state @xcite . in section",

    "we have explicitly evaluated the phase distribution and worked out the effects of different environmental parameters on the dynamics of the system starting with various initial states .    in particular , for a harmonic oscillator system in qnd interaction with its environment ( section iiia ) , we have considered two different initial conditions of the system , starting ( 1 ) in a coherent state , and ( 2 ) in a squeezed coherent state . the phase distribution corresponding to the unitary evolution in the second case is more tilted than that in the first case , which is a signature of the squeezing inherent in the initial state of the system .",
    "we have next taken an anharmonic oscillator ( section iiib ) , which could arise , for example , from the interaction of a single mode of the quantized electromagnetic field with a kerr medium , and constructed its phase distribution , again for different initial conditions : ( 1 ) the system starting in a kerr state , and ( 2 ) the system starting in a squeezed kerr state . with an increase in the evolution time @xmath54 , indicating an increase in exposure to the environment , the quantum phase distribution in the first case shifts as well as diffuses .",

    ", it is seen that the effect of the environment stays for a longer time at zero temperature than that at high temperature , and eventually the distribution tends to the uniform value of the first case , irrespective of the initial state of the system .    in all the cases considered , a broadening of the phase distribution curve , indicating an increase in phase diffusion , results with an increase in the bath temperature @xmath32 or bath squeezing parameter @xmath35 or evolution time @xmath54 .",
