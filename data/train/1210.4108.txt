    "gravity in general relativity is described by the curvature of spacetime .",
    "so a question that naturally arises is how observers may determine this curvature in their local neighborhood  @xcite by its effects on physical objects , like point particles and spinning gyroscopes .",
    "the most commonly discussed such effect is the relative acceleration between freely falling point particles near an observer s position .",
    "mathematically , this is described by the jacobi equation and hence sourced by the so - called electric components of the riemann tensor  @xcite .    in this article",
    "we will describe the effects of curvature on relatively moving gyroscope systems in detail . concretely",
    ", we will consider two sets of gyroscopes that define an orthogonal system of spatial axes ; these are synchronized at some initial point of spacetime ; then they are transported along different paths to a nearby final point where their axes are compared .",
    "it will turn out that the so - called magnetic components of the riemann tensor cause a loss of synchronization of the gyroscope systems which adds to non - gravitational effects coming from their relative velocity and relative acceleration .",
    "mathematically speaking , this generalizes the statement of the path - dependence of parallel transport on curved spacetimes into a statement about the path - dependence of fermi  walker transport . physically speaking",
    ", we will show that the loss of synchronization of initially aligned gyroscope axes can be interpreted as the relative rotation of observers spatial frames induced by gravity and their relative motion .",
    "experiments and calculations that study the effects of spacetime curvature on gyroscopes have been considered before , e.g. in @xcite .",
    "in contrast to earlier theoretical approaches , however , we construct a fully realizable synchronization and comparison procedure for the gyroscopes through timelike free - fall propagation .",
    "moreover , our calculation is fully covariant and applies to arbitrary spacetimes ; neither does it require a time - space split nor the metric perturbation theory of the ppn formalism .    as an application of our new results",
    "we will discuss a local experiment which enables observers to decide whether the spacetime they are living in is of kerr or schwarzschild type , i.e. , whether it possesses angular momentum or not .",
    "this is achieved locally without referring to observers or other quantities defined at infinity or using spacetime perturbation theory .",
    "we simply need to study the curvature induced relative rotation of gyroscope systems for locally non - rotating observers .",
    "we will begin in section  [ sec : vectrans ] by reviewing some mathematical concepts needed to analyze the curvature effects on gyroscope motion .",
    "in addition , we will develop the fermi  walker transport of gyroscopes along non - differentiable worldlines which is required to generalize the path - dependence theorem . in section  [ sec : theorems ]",
    "we will describe how observers may use gyroscope systems to synchronize their spatial frames .",
    "our main result theorem  1 ( which we will prove in full mathematical detail in the appendix ) then connects the desynchronization of gyroscope systems to the magnetic components of the riemann tensor",
    ". we will then derive theorem  2 that interprets our results in terms of relative local rotations of observers spatial frames of reference . in section [ sec : kerr ] we will apply our findings to demonstrate that a simple local gyroscope experiment can distinguish between kerr and schwarzschild spacetime . we will conclude with a discussion in section [ sec : disc ] .",
    "before we study how curvature effects gyroscopes , we review and develop some mathematical preliminaries .",
    "first , in section  [ sec : tp ] , we recall the notion of covariant taylor series on metric manifolds @xmath0 and the standard theorem about the connection between parallel transport along different paths and the riemann curvature tensor .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : basicgm ] , we clarify the basic properties of a gyroscope and review its motion through spacetime .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : gyrondw ] , we derive new results on the motion of gyroscopes along non - differentiable worldlines . the latter are needed for a precise description of the motion of the gyroscope systems considered in section [ sec : theorems ] .",
    "the covariant taylor expansion on metric manifolds @xmath0 is a way to expand tensors around a point @xmath1 in @xmath2 such that the coefficients of the taylor series are covariant objects ; details can be found in  @xcite . here , we only discuss the first order expansion of vector fields since this is all we will require below .",
    "consider a curve @xmath3 through @xmath4 and a vector field @xmath5 along this curve .",
    "let @xmath6 with @xmath7 be a basis of @xmath8 which is parallelly transported along @xmath9 , i.e. , @xmath10 .",
    "observe that this implies @xmath11 now we express @xmath5 in the parallelly transported basis and then taylor expand the components to equate @xmath12 p_\\mu(\\gamma(t))+\\mathcal{o}(t^2)\\,.\\ ] ] combining these formulae shows that this expansion is in fact a covariant taylor expansion with @xmath13 this type of expansion will be used repeatedly in the appendix where we will prove theorem  1 of section  [ sec : theorems ] .",
    "another small but important fact following from  ( [ eq : sma ] ) is that the components of a parallelly transported vector field with respect to a parallelly transported basis are constant along the path .",
    "a well - known mathematical theorem states that the riemann curvature of metric manifolds @xmath0 measures the difference of the parallel transports of an initial vector along two different paths to the same final point .",
    "more precisely , consider two commuting vector fields @xmath14 and @xmath15 on @xmath2 with @xmath16=0 $ ] .",
    "now moving from @xmath1 first along an integral curve of @xmath14 for parameter distance @xmath17 , then along an integral curve of @xmath15 for parameter distance @xmath18 ( path 1 ) reaches the same final point as moving from  @xmath1 first distance @xmath18 along @xmath15 , then distance @xmath17 along @xmath14 ( path 2 ) .",
    "the final points for different @xmath19 form a surface @xmath20 with @xmath21 and partial derivatives @xmath22 and @xmath23 , see figure [ fig : curv ] .",
    "let @xmath24 be an initial vector at the point @xmath25 .",
    "we write @xmath26 and @xmath27 for the vector fields generated from this vector by parallel transport along the respective paths 1 and 2 . with this notation",
    "the theorem states  @xcite : @xmath28    parallel transport of a vector along two different paths.,width=259 ]    the central result of this paper , theorem  1 , will be a generalization of this theorem .",
    "it shows that the path - dependence of the fermi ",
    "walker transported spin axes of gyroscope systems is related to the riemann curvature tensor and their relative motion .",
    "we will show that this has a nice physical interpretation : gravity induces a relative rotation on all spatially separated frames of reference and thus on all physical objects .",
    "the physics of a gyroscope is characterized by an intrinsic angular momentum vector field  @xmath29 defined along the timelike worldline @xmath30 with unit normalized four - velocity , @xmath31 .",
    "the field  @xmath29 satisfies two requirements :    1 .",
    "@xmath29 is spatial in the gyroscope s reference frame , i.e. , @xmath32 ; 2 .",
    "no torque is applied to the gyroscope ; following @xcite this means @xmath33 .    by differentiating the first condition along the worldline and projecting the second condition on the direction @xmath34 , one finds the transport equation for @xmath29 : @xmath35 we emphasize that the unit normalization of @xmath34 is crucial for this equation to hold",
    "; it is not invariant under rescalings of @xmath34 .",
    "the above transport law for the intrinsic angular momentum of a gyroscope is known as fermi  walker transport .",
    "the gyroscope transport equation implies that the normalization @xmath36 stays constant along the worldline @xmath9 .",
    "this fact can be used to show that the axis of rotation defined by the normalized vector field @xmath37 satisfies the same equation as @xmath29 .",
    "now consider a system of three gyroscopes with initially orthonormal rotation axes @xmath38 for @xmath39 .",
    "then the initial orthonormality @xmath40 of this system is preserved along the worldline , since @xmath41 hence an orthonormal system of gyroscopes always will stay orthonormal , no matter how it moves .",
    "in particular the system could be arbitrarily accelerated and rotated .    the last ingredient missing before we can describe the synchronization of spatial frames is the transport of gyroscopes along non - differentiable worldlines .",
    "the difficulty here is to guarantee that the gyroscope axes stay spatial with respect to their actual worldline tangent .",
    "an observer with a gyroscope could decide at some point @xmath42 in time to move it around in his laboratory . in an idealized situation , the worldline @xmath9 of this gyroscope that followed the worldline of the observer for @xmath43 would then non - differentiably branch off at @xmath44 .",
    "hence @xmath45 here the gyroscope transport equation ( [ eq : gyro ] ) can only be applied on the domains @xmath43 and @xmath46 . there",
    "it ensures that the intrinsic angular momentum @xmath29 always stays spatial , i.e. , orthogonal to  @xmath34 , which is realized by infinitesimal pure lorentz boosts in the planes spanned by  @xmath34 and the acceleration @xmath47 .    however , at @xmath42",
    "the notion of space abruptly changes .",
    "there the final intrinsic angular momentum @xmath48 reached along @xmath43 which is orthogonal to @xmath49 has to be mapped by hand into a corresponding value @xmath50 orthogonal to @xmath51 that may serve as initial condition for further transport for @xmath46 .",
    "the relevant map is the unique finite pure lorentz boost @xmath52 that maps @xmath53 without involving any spatial rotation .    in order to find this map we consider the generators for boosts in the plane spanned by @xmath54 , where we write @xmath55 with respect to an orthonormal basis @xmath56 with @xmath57 .",

    "the application of this lorentz transformation to an intrinsic angular momentum vector @xmath66 orthogonal to @xmath49 yields after some rewriting @xmath67 this formula shows that the difference @xmath68 indeed lies in the plane @xmath54 .",
    "moreover , it is not difficult to check that @xmath69 is now spatial with respect to the new time direction , @xmath70 , and has the same length as before the lorentz boost , @xmath71 .",
    "this is the central section of this article , where we will analyze in detail the spacetime effects on gyroscope systems by considering the path - dependence of gyroscope , or fermi  walker , transport .",
    "we will show that two systems of initially synchronized gyroscopes that form aligned orthonormal spatial frames of reference gradually lose their synchronization .",
    "the effects come from non - vanishing magnetic components of the riemann tensor and the relative velocity and acceleration of the gyroscope systems .",
    "our results are presented in the form of two theorems .",
    "theorem  1 in section  [ sec : ex ] establishes the details of gyroscope desynchronization , and theorem  2 in section  [ sec : localrot ] provides a physical interpretation in terms of measurable relative rotations of the gyroscope axes and spatial observer frames .",
    "consider a freely falling observer who prepares two aligned copies of a system of three gyroscopes with axes that represent her spatial orthonormal frame .",
    "let a second observer move along an arbitrary timelike worldline in some small distance to the first . in order to equip the second observer with a synchronized gyroscope system ,",
    "the first initiates the free fall of one of the two aligned gyroscope systems to the second .",
    "then both observers propagate with their gyroscope systems through spacetime . after some time they wish to compare their gyroscope systems .",
    "to do so , the first observer initiates another free fall of her remaining gyroscope system to the second observer , who now compares the axes of both gyroscope systems . in general",
    ", it will turn out that the gyroscopes have lost their synchronization .",
    "we will see that to first non - trivial order this desynchronization is sourced not only by the riemann curvature tensor of spacetime but also by contributions depending on the relative velocity and relative acceleration between the two observers .",
    "mathematically , we describe the spacetime effects on gyroscope systems by a two - surface @xmath72 with parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 . for fixed @xmath17 or @xmath18 this surface",

    "now the transport equation ( [ eq : gyro ] ) can be applied . when the second observer receives the gyroscope at @xmath90 another lorentz boost has to be applied to ensure that the gyroscope axes become orthogonal to the second observers worldline @xmath99 .",
