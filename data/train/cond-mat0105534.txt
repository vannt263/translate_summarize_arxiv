    "the experimental detection @xcite of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) at ultralow temperature in dilute trapped alkali metal and hydrogen atoms has initiated intense theoretical activities in this subject @xcite .",
    "many properties of the condensate are usually described by the nonlinear meanfield gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation @xcite which can be considered to be a generalization of the schrdinger equation in the presence of interatomic interaction leading to a nonlinear term .",
    "two interesting features of bec are ( a ) the collapse in the case of an attractive atomic interaction @xcite and ( b ) the possibility of the formation of a hybrid atomic and molecular condensate @xcite coupled by coherent raman transition @xcite or feshbach resonance @xcite .",
    "although there has been experimental observation of a coupled bec involving two atomic states @xcite , so far there has been no experimental realization of a molecular bec .",
    "because of the intrinsic interest in a hybrid atomic and molecular bec , in this work the dynamics of such a bec is studied using the time - dependent gp equation with special attention to its stability and collapse . for the case of a trapped two - species bec a large repulsive interaction between the two species can induce instability in the system @xcite .    for attractive interatomic interaction @xcite ,",
    "the condensate is stable for a maximum critical number of atoms .",
    "when the number of atoms increases beyond the critical number , due to interatomic attraction the radius of bec tends to zero and the central density tends to infinity .",
    "consequently , the condensate collapses emitting atoms until the number of atoms is reduced below the critical number and a stable configuration is reached . with a supply of atoms from an external source",
    "the condensate can grow again and thus a series of collapses can take place , which was observed experimentally in the bec of @xmath0li with attractive interaction @xcite .",
    "theoretical analyses based on the gp equation also confirm the collapse @xcite .",
    "the possibility of the formation of a hybrid trapped atomic bec coupled to a bec of diatomic molecules via either raman photoassociation @xcite or a feshbach resonance @xcite has been suggested and studied recently @xcite .",
    "these authors used a nonlinear interaction term @xcite in the hamiltonian that allows for a coherent number - conserving nondissipative transition of two atoms to a molecule and vice versa .",
    "possible candidates for molecular bec are @xmath1rb@xmath2 , @xmath3rb@xmath2 , @xmath4na@xmath2 etc @xcite .",
    "the coherently coupled bec could allow localized solitons even in the absence of a trap @xcite .",
    "however , in this work we shall only consider the interesting dynamics of this hybrid bec in the presence of a trap .",
    "because of the general interest there have been several theoretical studies involving two coupled atomic condensates @xcite    here we critically study the atomic plus molecular hybrid bec in the presence of attractive bosonic interaction(s ) .",
    "the usual gp equation allowing for transition of two atoms to a molecule and vice versa conserves the overall number of atoms . in the study of the dynamics of this bec , oscillation of the individual numbers of atoms and molecules",
    "are found with the conservation of overall total number ( number of atoms plus twice the number of diatomic molecules ) .",
    "the dynamics of collapse for attractive interaction is studied by introducing absorptive contact interactions which allow for a growth in the particle numbers from an external source in addition to imaginary quartic three - body interactions responsible for recombination loss @xcite . in the presence of the imaginary contact and three - body interactions",
    "the gp equation does not conserve the overall number of atoms .",
    "if the strengths ( and signs ) of these two imaginary interactions are properly chosen , the solution of the gp equation could produce a growth of the condensate with time for numbers of atoms and molecules less than the respective critical numbers .",
    "once they increase past these critical numbers the three - body interaction takes control and these numbers suddenly drop below the critical level by recombination loss signaling a collapse @xcite .",
    "then the absorptive term takes over and the individual numbers start to increase .",
    "this continues indefinitely showing an infinite sequence of collapses .",
    "there are three types of nonlinear interactions in the gp equation for the hybrid bec of atoms and molecules : e.g. , between two atoms , between two molecules , and between an atom and a molecule .",
    "if one of these is attractive , one component of the condensate may experience collapse .",
    "if two are attractive one can have collapse in both components .",
    "specifically , one can also have collapse of both components if only the interaction between an atom and a molecule is sufficiently attractive .    in sec .",
    "ii we present a set of coupled gp equations which is appropriate for the study of the hybrid atomic - molecular bec including a new nonlinear interaction term which allows for the possibility of transformation of two atoms in the condensate to a molecule and vice versa .",
    "in addition we include an absorptive contact term and a three - body recombination term appropriate for studying collapse of the bec . in sec .",
    "iii we solve the coupled gp equation numerically and study the hybrid atomic - molecular bec under different possibilities of atomic and molecular interactions . finally , in sec .",
    "iv we give some concluding remarks .",
    "here , in addition to the kinetic energies , trap potentials , and usual nonlinear interaction terms the following interaction responsible for a nondissipative transfer of two atoms into a molecule and vice versa is also considered in the hamiltonian @xcite @xmath5,\\ ] ] where @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) is the complex atomic ( diatomic molecular ) field and @xmath8 the coupling . for a nonzero @xmath8 neither the number of atoms nor that of the molecules is conserved .",
    "however the total mass of all the atoms and molecules is conserved . in a bec the chemical conversion of two atoms to a diatomic molecule",
    "is dominated by coherent stimulated emission , in which transitions are enhanced by the number of molecules already occupying the ground state .",
    "the conversion of atoms to molecules could be resonant via a feshbach resonance . or",

    "the resulting solution is the ground state of the condensate corresponding to the specific nonlinearity .",
    "the time - dependent approach is the most suitable for solving time - evolution problems . in the present study we only consider evolution problems starting from a stable condensate at @xmath90 . in these cases",
    "the stationary problem is solved first and the wave function so obtained serves as the starting wave function for the time - evolution problem .    to study the effect of an external source of bosons on preformed condensate(s )",
    "we need to set @xmath91 and @xmath92 and perform the time iteration of the gp equations ( [ e ] ) and ( [ f ] ) starting at @xmath90 from the solution obtained with @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "a nonzero @xmath38 will make the condensate grow in size absorbing bosons from outside . in the case of attractive interaction(s ) , as the condensate grows past the critical size a nonzero @xmath95 will allow for three - body recombination so that the condensate can shrink and experience the so called collapse by emitting particles .",
    "hence a nonzero @xmath38 and @xmath96 could simulate the dynamical growth of the condensate in general as well as its collapse for attractive interaction .",
    "instead of concentrating on a specific atomic - molecular bec , here we study some universal features of such a bec related to stability and collapse . for a specific application",
    "we require the knowledge of the different scattering lengths : those for two atoms , two molecules and between an atom and a molecule . at present",
    "these scattering lengths are not all known for a specific system .",
    "first we consider the nondissipative solutions of ( [ e ] ) and ( [ f ] ) obtained with @xmath97 and @xmath49 for all repulsive interactions and demonstrate the oscillation of numbers of atoms and molecules . in this case",
    "the condensate increases in size indefinitely with time if a nonzero @xmath38 and @xmath39 are used .",
    "this is why it can be termed stable .",
    "however , there is spontaneous transformation of atoms to molecules and vice versa even for @xmath49 and the number of atoms and molecules oscillate with time .",
    "the numerical results are convergent for small values of nonlinear parameters @xmath36 and @xmath88 . here to demonstrate the viability of the present numerical scheme we present results for reasonably large values of @xmath36 . specifically , we consider @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 and @xmath103 . for a typical experimental situation @xcite",
    "this corresponds to @xmath104 .",
    "the solution of the complete coupled gp equations ( [ e ] ) and ( [ f ] ) is obtained by iteration starting with the solution of the uncoupled schrdinger equation for the harmonic oscillator problem obtained by setting @xmath105 in these equations .",
    "the nonlinear parameters @xmath36 are increased in small steps during iteration until their final values are reached after 1000 iterations .",
    "we then obtain the desired solution of the coupled gp equation . in figure 1 ( a )",
    "we plot the atomic and molecular wave functions @xmath106 and @xmath107 obtained from this procedure .",
    "we continue the time iteration after the solutions of the coupled gp equation shown in figure 1 ( a ) are obtained at a specific time , which we now call @xmath90 , without changing the nonlinear parameters anymore . in figure 1 ( b )",
    "we plot the quantities @xmath108 and @xmath109 vs. time @xmath110 for @xmath111 . for @xmath97 , as shown in figure 1 ( b ) , the numbers @xmath108 and @xmath46 undergo rapid oscillations . in figure 1 ( c )",
    "we plot the corresponding rms radii of the atomic and molecular condensates for @xmath111 .",
    "we find that the rms radii also execute oscillation along with @xmath45 and @xmath46 due to continued dynamical conversion of atoms to molecules and vice versa .",
    "the oscillation of the rms radii is related to the radial oscillation of the condensate .",
    "now we consider the case of attractive atomic and molecular interaction(s ) which may lead to collapse .",
    "we note that @xmath88 is a nonlinear parameter in the coupled gp equation and a large value of the nonlinear parameter @xmath88 will imply a large numerical error in the solution .",
    "a very small @xmath88 on the other hand will not give adequate feedback between atoms and molecules .",
    "we study collapse in the hybrid bec under several conditions with @xmath112 , as this value of @xmath88 gives adequate feedback between atoms and molecules and accurate numerical result .",
    "first we study the simplest case of collapse by taking all interactions to be attractive corresponding to a negative @xmath36 for all @xmath19 and @xmath24 .",
    "now both components of bec could experience collapse . in this case",
    "the wave function components calculated numerically as in figure 1 ( a ) at @xmath90 are plotted in figure 2 ( a ) for @xmath113 @xmath98 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , with @xmath89 . in the case of attractive interaction , for bec with",
    "@xmath0li the typical number of atoms in the condensate is 10@xmath116 and @xmath117 to 10@xmath118 @xcite . in this example , @xmath119 , and @xmath120 .",
    "hence the present numbers are well within the experimental scenario of bec for atoms with attractive interaction . from figure 2 ( a ) we find that the wave - function components are more centrally peaked compared to those in figure 1 ( a ) .",
    "this corresponds to small rms radii and large central density denoting an approximation to collapse .",
    "although the collapse of the coupled condensates could be inferred from the wave functions of figure 2 ( a ) , we also study the dynamics of the collapse from a time evolution of gp equations ( [ e ] ) and ( [ f ] ) for @xmath111 in the presence of an absorption and three - body recombination , e.g. , for @xmath91 and @xmath121 @xcite .",
    "we consider the solution of ( [ e ] ) and ( [ f ] ) as shown in figure 2 ( a ) at @xmath90 and allow this solution to evolve in time with @xmath91 and @xmath122 by iteration .",
    "the general nature of time evolution is independent of the actual values of @xmath38 and @xmath39 employed , provided that a very small value for @xmath123 and a relatively larger one for @xmath124 ) are chosen @xcite . in actual calculation we took @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "the quantities @xmath45 and @xmath46 show the succession of collapses in a transparent fashion and we plot them in figure 2 ( b ) vs. time @xmath110 .",
    "these quantities increase with time due to the absorptive interaction ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "once they are larger than the respective critical numbers for collapse , the three - body recombination takes over and these quantities fall below the critical level and the system collapses .",
    "then the absorptive term is operative and these quantities increase again resulting in a sequence of collapses . in figure 2 ( c )",
    "we plot the rms radii @xmath127 of the atomic and molecular condensates of the model of figure 2 ( b ) undergoing collapse for @xmath111 .",
    "the rms radii of the components execute oscillation similar to those in the uncoupled case @xcite .",
    "the collapse was studied under various situations .",
    "after numerical investigation we find if only the diagonal parameter @xmath128 or @xmath129 is attractive and all other @xmath36 s are repulsive then it is possible to have a collapse of component 1 or 2 .",
    "if in addition to one diagonal parameter @xmath130 , the nondiagonal parameters @xmath131 and @xmath132 are attractive , it is possible to have a collapse in both components . if both diagonal parameters @xmath128 and @xmath129 are attractive , one can have collapse of both the components .    instead of reporting all our studies , in the following we consider the special case of collapse in the case where the diagonal elements @xmath128 and @xmath129 are positive and the nondiagonal terms @xmath131 and @xmath132 are negative .",
    "this corresponds to repulsion between two atoms and between two molecules and an attraction between a molecule and an atom .",
    "this case is of relevance , as experimentally , the rubidium system has been measured to have strongly attractive atom - molecule interaction and repulsive atom - atom and molecule - molecule interactions @xcite . also , it is now possible to vary continuously the nature ( attractive or repulsive ) and strength of interaction between bosons @xcite which can create a specific situation of atom - molecule , atom - atom and molecule - molecule interactions .",
    "we find that when @xmath131 and @xmath132 are sufficiently attractive , they can surplus the repulsive terms @xmath128 and @xmath129 in ( [ e ] ) and ( [ f ] ) and the overall effective contribution of the quadratic nonlinear terms in these equations becomes attractive and one can have a collapse of both the components . to illustrate this interesting effect we study numerically the collapse for a negative @xmath131 and @xmath133 and positive @xmath128 and @xmath129 . in figure 3 ( a ) we plot the wave - function components obtained by solving ( [ e ] ) and ( [ f ] ) with @xmath134 @xmath135 @xmath136 @xmath98 , @xmath114 , @xmath137 and @xmath49 .",
    "both wave - function components are peaked near @xmath61 and have small rms radii .",
    "the system collapses with a small increase in @xmath138 and/or @xmath139 .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath45 and @xmath46 , and the corresponding rms radii are found by solving ( [ e ] ) and ( [ f ] ) iteratively with nonzero @xmath39 and @xmath38 starting with the wave function presented in figure 3 ( a ) at @xmath90 . for @xmath111",
