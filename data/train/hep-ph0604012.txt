    "neutrino oscillation experiments , including the results of kamland @xcite have confirmed the lma - msw oscillation solution of the solar neutrino problem .",
    "together with the earlier discoveries in atmospheric neutrinos @xcite , one can be fairly confident that all neutrino flavours mix and that at least two non - zero neutrino masses exist .    in the standard model neutrinos",
    "are massless . among all the existing models to generate small neutrino majorana masses",
    "the seesaw mechanism @xcite is perhaps the most popular .",
    "however , this is not the only theoretical approach to neutrino masses .",

    "here we consider a particular radiative mechanism , the zee model @xcite . in this model",
    "the scalar sector of the standard model is enlarged to include a charged su(2 ) gauge singlet scalar and a second higgs doublet .",
    "this particle content allows to write an explicit lepton number ( @xmath7 ) violating term in the scalar potential and leads to neutrino masses at one loop order . in the minimal zee model ( mzm ) , only one higgs doublet couples to leptons @xcite . as a result ,",
    "dangerous flavour changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes are forbidden .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that combining sno , kamland and k2k experimental data this version is ruled out .",
    "however , this does not mean that the zee model is ruled out . the original version , from now on called the general zee model ( gzm ) @xcite , in which both of the two higgs doublets couple to the matter fields has been shown @xcite to be consistent with atmospheric and solar neutrino data as well @xcite .",
    "once one allows both of the higgs doublets to couple to leptons the number of model parameters increases . here",
    "instead of working with all the couplings of the model we will consider a scheme , previously discussed in references @xcite , where the neutrino mass matrix has a two - zero - texture .",
    "this particular gzm will be called next to mzm ( nmzm ) .    in the higgs sector , after spontaneous breaking of the electroweak symmetry , the charged gauge singlet mixes with the charged components of the two higgs doublets .",
    "the resulting charged higgs eigenstates ( @xmath8 with @xmath9 ) decay to states with charged leptons and neutrinos .",
    "these decays can be used , in principle , to reconstruct the majorana neutrino mass matrix .",
    "we will show that due to the constraints imposed by neutrino physics , the @xmath10 is enhanced in comparision to the two - higgs doublet models ( 2hdm ) of type - i and type - ii .",

    "we have shown that in the small mixing limit ( @xmath130 ) certain ratios of branching ratios can be used to obtain information about the parameters of the model .",
    "besides the charged higgs leptonic decays we have also considered the decay @xmath224 .",
    "we have found that this decay , if kinematically allowed , can be used to determine the value of the @xmath17 parameter .",
    "moreover , measurements of @xmath225 allow to decide whether the small mixing limit is realized or not .",
    "assuming that there are no large hierarchies among the couplings @xmath226 ( @xmath227 ) and @xmath96 , and using neutrino physics constraints we have shown that in this scheme only three parameters are independent .",
    "we have found that there are four regions , in this three - dimensional parameter space , determined by only @xmath120 .",
    "we have shown that two of these four regions are governed by large values of @xmath120 ( @xmath228 ) while the other two regions are governed by small values of @xmath120 ( @xmath229 ) .",
    "we have analysed charged higgs leptonic decays in the large as well as in the small @xmath120 regimes and we have found : ( i ) in the large @xmath120 case , there is a region in which the decays @xmath230 and @xmath231 are governed by the correponding yukawas as in the 2hdm of type - i and type - ii and another region where the decay @xmath230 is enhanced and moreover can be larger than the decay to @xmath231 .",
    "( ii ) in the small @xmath120 case the decay @xmath230 is always enhanced and is larger than the decay @xmath231 . therefore we suggest that in order to test the model the decays of the charged higgs to @xmath232 should be searched along with the decays to @xmath233 .",
    "in fact , measurements of the ratio of branching ratios @xmath234 could give information about what region of this parameter space is realized .    at future colliders",
    "the decay channel @xmath235 is very important for the discovery of charged higgs bosons @xcite . for the lhc and susy like 2hdm",
    ", it has been claimed that the existence of a relatively heavy charged higgs bosons , of mass up to 1 tev , can be probed using the signal @xmath236 @xcite . at future linear colliders a single",
    "produced charged higgs should be associated with the tau and the neutrino coming from the virtual charged higgs decay @xcite . according to our results , and illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig : br - o33 ] , the charged higgs could emerge from a signal with @xmath232 instead of @xmath233 .",
    "moreover , for a light charged scalar ( @xmath237 ) the ratio of branching ratios , @xmath234 should be measurable .",
