    "in the moment formalism of ( relativistic ) radiation hydrodynamics , in order to close the moment equations truncated at a finite order , we need a _ closure relation _ , such as the eddington approximation or more complex expressions . in non - relativistic static atmospheres ( chandrasekhar 1960 ; mihalas 1970 ; rybicki & lightman 1979 ; mihalas & mihalas 1984 ; shu 1991 ; peraiah 2002 ; castor 2004 ) , for example ,",
    "many researchers have used the eddington approximation and variable eddington factors as closure relations ( milne 1921 ; eddington 1926 ; kosirev 1934 ; chandrasekhar 1934 ; hummer & rybicki 1971 ; wilson et al . 1972 ; tamazawa et al . 1975 ; unno & kondo 1976 ; masaki & unno 1978 ) . as is well known , the standard eddington approximation with the eddington factor of @xmath6 is valid when the radiation field is almost _",
    "isotropic_. in the spherically symmetric case , where the radiation field becomes anisotropic towards the outer optically thin region , they often used the variable eddington factor , which depends on the optical depth ( e.g. , tamazawa et al .",
    "1975 ) .    in relativistically moving flows ( mihalas et al .",

    "even for a comoving observer , however , the comoving radiation field may become _ anisotropic _ due to various reasons as shown below . instead of the standard eddington approximation in the comoving frame , for such a relativistic case several types of a _",
    "variable eddington factor _ , which depends on the velocity and its gradient as well as the optical depth , were proposed ( fukue 2006 ; fukue & akizuki 2006 , 2007 ; akizuki & fukue 2008 ; fukue 2008a , b ; koizumi & umemura 2008 ) . however , the moment formalism of relativistic radiation hydrodynamics is yet _ incomplete _ , in a sense that we do not have the sufficiently adequate closure relation .",
    "there are mainly three reasons , which cause the anisotropy of the comoving radiation field in the relativistically moving flow .",
    "( 1 ) the optical depth effect . in the outer region where the flow becomes optically thin , similar to the non - relativistic case",
    ", the comoving radiation field would be anisotropic .",
    "( 2 ) the velocity gradient effect . when the radiative flow is accelerated up to the relativistic regime and there is a strong velocity gradient in the direction of the flow , the velocity fields as well as the density distribution are no longer uniform even in the comoving frame .",
    "then , the comoving radiation field also becomes non - uniform .",
    "furthermore , due to the relative speed between the observer and the radiation field , the observed radiation field suffers from the doppler effect . as a result ,",
    "the comoving radiation field becomes anisotropic .",
    "( 3 ) the effect of the relativistic speed itself .",
    "although we do not know the radiative intensity in the inertial frame , in the highly relativistic regime it is generally affected by the strong aberration effect when it is converted to the comoving frame . as a result , except for some special cases , the comoving radiative intensity generally has strong anisotropy .    hence , the relativistic variable eddington factor ( rvef ) generally depends on the optical depth , the flow velocity , and the velocity gradient . in fukue ( 2006 ) and",
    "akizuki and fukue ( 2008 ) , they proposed such variable eddington factors from physical view points in the plane - parallel and spherical cases , respectively . in fukue",
    "( 2008a , b ) , on the other hand , he derived semi - analytically variable eddington factors for the plane - parallel flows in the vertical direction , and found that the eddington factor decreases as the velocity - gradient increases . in these studies",
    "( fukue 2008a , b ) , however , the treatments were rather restrictive ; e.g. , the comoving radiation field is assumed to be uniform .",
    "thus , in the present paper we extend the previous work under the similar procedure to examine the above three reasons more extensively .    in the next section",
    "we describe the shape of the surface ( one - tau photo - oval ) , where the optical depth measured by the comoving observer is unity , and derive the expression of the one - tau photo - oval . in section 3",
    "we numerically calculate the comoving radiation field within the photo - oval , and the relativistic variable eddington factor for several cases .",
    "the final section is devoted to concluding remarks .",
    "let us suppose a relativistic radiative flow , which is accelerated in the vertical ( @xmath7 ) direction , and a comoving observer , who moves upward with the flow ( figure 1 ) .",
    "( 70mm,70mm)figure01.eps    sufficiently deep inside the flow , where the optical depth is very large , the mean free path of photons is very short .",
    "in such a case , within the range of the mean free path , for the comoving observer the flow is seen to be almost uniform ; the velocity gradient and resultant density gradient are negligible .",
    "hence , the mean free path is the same in all directions , and the shape of the surface where the optical depth measured from the comoving observer is unity , is almost a sphere ; we call it a _ one - tau photo - sphere _ ( a dashed circle in figure 1 ) . as a result ,",
    "the comoving radiation field is nearly isotropic , and a usual eddington approximation in the comoving frame is valid .    on the other hand ,",
    "if the velocity gradient becomes very large , the behavior of the radiation field may be affected by changes in the hydrodynamics of the flow even on a lengthscale comparable to that of the photon mean free path .",
    "hence , the mean free path becomes longer in the downstream direction than in the upstream and other directions , and the shape of the one - tau range elongates in the downstream direction ; we call it a _ one - tau photo - oval _",
    "( a dashed oval in figure 1 ) . as a result ,",
    "the comoving radiation field becomes _ anisotropic _ due to various reasons as described in the introduction , and we should modify the usual eddington approximation .",
    "in addition , when the optical depth is sufficiently small and/or the velocity gradient is suffiently large , the mean free path of photons in the downstream direction become less than unity .",
    "hence , the shape of the one - tau range is open in the downstream direction ; we call it a _ one - tau photo - vessel _ ( a dashed hemi - circle in figure 1 ) .    in order to obtain an appropriate form of the relativistic variable eddington factor in these regimes , we thus carefully treat and examine the radiation field in the comoving frame .    in previous papers ( fukue 2008a , b )",
    ", we have examined the one - tau photo - oval , derived the variable eddington factor semi - analytically , and proved that the eddington factor decreases with the velocity gradient . in these studies , however , the treatment were rather restricted , and in the present study , we thus examine the behavior of the relativistic variable eddington factor for more general cases , and seek the appropriate form of the eddington factor @xmath8 , where @xmath1 is the optical depth and @xmath2 ( @xmath9 ) is the four velocity , @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) being the normalized velocity and the lorentz factor , respectively .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)figure02.eps    we first derive the shape of the one - tau photo - oval using the optical depth @xmath1 , while in the previous papers we have used the vertical coordinate @xmath7 .",
    "we define the one - tau photo - oval as the surface where the optical depth measured by the comoving observer is unity .",
    "the situation is schematically illustrated in figure 2 .",
    "we assume that the comoving observer in the vertical flow is located at @xmath13 or @xmath14 , where the flow four speed is @xmath15 . in the @xmath16-direction , that forms an angle @xmath17 with the downstream direction , the mean free path of photons is @xmath18 .",
    "the relation among these quantities is @xmath19    the continuity equation for the stationary , one - dimensional relativistic flow is @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the proper gas density , @xmath2 the four velocity , and @xmath22 the mass - flow rate per unit area . in addition , the optical depth @xmath1 is defined by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the opacity , which is assumed to be constant in the present analysis , and we used equation ( [ zz0 ] ) .    in this paper",
    "we use a linear approximation for the flow field ; that is to say , around the position of the comoving observer the flow four speed is expanded as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is assumed to be constant .    using equation ( [ tau ] ) , the optical depth @xmath27 along the @xmath16-direction is expressed as @xmath28 thus , the shape of the one - tau photo - oval , where @xmath29 , is finally determined by the condition : @xmath30 obviously , for @xmath31 the one - tau region is close to be a photo - oval , whereas it is open towards a downstream direction to be a photo - vessel for @xmath32 .",
    "we can now compute the radiation field received by the comoving observer , and derive an expression for the eddington factor in the comoving frame ( figure 3 ) .    in a static and optically thick atmosphere , the radiation field is isotropic and uniform . in the present moving atmosphere , on the other hand , there are three reasons for which the radiation field is not uniform and isotropic , as described in the introduction ; the optical depth effect , the velocity gradient effect , and the effect of the relativistic speed itself .",
    "first , the radiative intensity @xmath33 in the comoving frame emitted from the one - tau photo - oval walls is generally a function of @xmath1 and @xmath34 . in general the radiative intensity increases with the optical depth , and therefore ,",
    "the intensity from the upstream direction is slightly larger than that from the downstream direction in the present one - dimensional vertical flow .",
    "this effect of non - uniformity of intensity generally acts as a force to accelerate a comoving observer .",
    "this optical depth effect is prominent for small optical depth , similar to the static atmosphere .",
    "second , although in the usual static atmosphere the @xmath34-dependence is safely ignored for large optical depth , this is not the present relativistic case .",
    "namely , in the relativistic flow there appear the aberration and doppler effects between the inertial and comoving frames .",
    "hence , except for very special cases , the comoving radiative intensity would have strong anisotropy .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)figure03.eps    thirdly , if there is a velocity gradient in the flow , the intensity observed by the comoving observer is redshifted ( doppler shifted ) due to the velocity difference between the comoving observer and the one - tau photo - oval walls . in an accelerating flow , where the flow speed increases toward the downstream direction ,",
    "the relative velocity is generally positive ( figure 3 ) except for some special direction ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "hence , the doppler shift of intensity also causes anisotropy of the radiation field at the position of the comoving observer .    neglecting the local emissivity ,",
    "the frequency - integrated intensity @xmath36 observed in the comoving frame at the position @xmath37 of the comoving observer is related to the frequency - integrated intensity @xmath38 emitted at the one - tau photo - oval and to the redshift @xmath7 by @xmath39 the relative speed @xmath40 between the comoving observer and the one - tau photo - oval walls is given by the relativistic summation law as @xmath41 where @xmath42 it should be noted that as long as the velocity gradient is positive ( accelerating flow ) the relative speed ( [ dbeta ] ) is always positive ( or zero ) , and the one - tau photo - oval is seen to expand ( figure 3 ) . using the relative speed above",

    "we first consider the velocity gradient effect , similar to the previous studies ( fukue 2008a , b ) , and also the photo - vessel case , which was not considered in the previous studies . to clarify the velocity gradient effect , we here assume that the comoving radiation field is uniform : @xmath51    the numerical results of this uniform case are shown in figure 4 for small @xmath44 and figure 5 for large @xmath44 . in figures 4a and 5a the relativistic variable eddington factors @xmath52 multiplied by 3 are plotted in the parameter space , whereas they are plotted for several fixed @xmath44 with fitting curves in figures 4b and 5b .",

    "6a the values of @xmath54 are plotted as a function of @xmath55 for several values of @xmath37 by dashed curves ( @xmath67 from bottom to top ) and by solid curves ( @xmath68 from bottom to top ) for @xmath69 .",
    "the tendencies are similar , but there exist weak deviations .    in figure",
    "6b the value of @xmath54 is plotted as a function of @xmath37 for @xmath69 and @xmath70 . even if there is no velocity gradient , the value of rvef changes with the optical depth .",
    "this is understood as follows .",
    "when the optical depth @xmath37 is larger than unity ( photo - oval ) , @xmath71 in the uniform radiation field without the velocity gradient .",
    "when the optical depth becomes smaller than unity ( photo - vessel ) , the eddington factor also becomes smaller than @xmath6 , since the radiation field is no longer isotropic ; the radiation from the downstream direction vanishes . when the optical depth approaches zero , however , the eddington factor recovers to @xmath6 , since the eddington factor above the infinite plane is @xmath6 . the dependence on the optical depth in figure 6b is well fitted by @xmath72 which is shown by a thick dashed curve in figure 6b , without any significant error .",
    "next , we examine the optical depth effect , where the background radiation field is not uniform .",
    "we assume that the comoving radiation field is the milne - eddington type : @xmath73 here , @xmath1 is the optical depth , which is related to the observer s quantities by equation ( [ oval ] ) , and @xmath34 is the direction cosine in the comoving frame , which is related to the observer s quantities by @xmath74 if we consider the aberration effect between the observer and the radiation site on the photo - oval in the comoving frame .    using this intensity distribution in the comoving frame , we easily compute the radiation field and the eddington factor . the numerical results are shown in figure 7 . in figures 7a and 7b the relativistic variable eddington factors @xmath52 multiplied by 3 are plotted in the parameter space for the uniform case ( figure 7a ) and for the milne - eddington case ( figure 7b ) .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)figure07a.eps ( 80mm,80mm)figure07b.eps    as is seen in figure 7 , the distribution of rvef of the milne - eddington case is not so much different from that of the uniform case . for larger @xmath44",
    "the difference becomes much small .",
    "hence , the weak non - uniformity or weak anisotropy does not significantly affect the values of rvef .",
    "thirdly , we investigate the effect of the relativistic speed itself .",
    "although there may be various kinds of anisotropy , we consider the simple limiting case ; we assume that the radiation field in the inertial frame is uniform .",
    "then , the comoving radiation field is expressed as @xmath75 ^ 4 }                     \\bar{i},\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the flow speed in units of the speed of light , @xmath11 the lorentz factor , and @xmath34 the direction cosine in the comoving frame given by equation ( [ aberration ] ) .",
    "thus , due to the aberration effect the comoving radiation field becomes strongly anistropic .",
    "namely , when the radiative intensity in the comoving frame is uniform , the intensity in the inertial frame becomes anisotropic in the sense that the observer in the inertial frame receives the strong radiation from the upstream direction .",
    "when the radiative intensity in the inertial frame is uniform , on the other hand , the intensity in the comoving frame becomes anisotropic in the sense that the comoving observer receives the strong radiation from the downstream direction .",
    "the numerical results of this anisotropic case are shown in figure 8 . in figure",
    "8a the relativistic variable eddington factor @xmath52 multiplied by 3 is plotted in the parameter space , whereas it is plotted as a function of @xmath44 with fitting curves in figure 8b .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)figure08a.eps ( 80mm,80mm)figure08b.eps    the behavior of rvef shown in figure 8a is quite impressive , since it seems that @xmath0 does not depend on the velocity gradient , but depends only on the velocity .",
    "indeed , in figure 8b the values of @xmath54 are plotted as a function of @xmath44 for several fixed @xmath55 ( @xmath76 ) by solid curves , and all curves overlap each other .",
    "one fitting curve is also plotted by a thick dashed one , and the numerical results are well fitted by @xmath77 as comparisons , rvef proposed in fukue ( 2006 ) are also plotted by the thin dashed one ( @xmath78 ) and the thin dotted one ( @xmath79 ) .    as is seen in figure 8b , equation ( [ best ] )",
    "reproduces the numerical results very well .",
    "this is interpreted as follows .",
    "when the radiation intensity in the inertial frame is uniform , the radiation energy density @xmath80 , the radiative flux @xmath81 , and the radiation pressure @xmath82 in the inertial ( laboratory ) frame become , respectively , @xmath83 for @xmath31 . hence , from the lorentz transformation the radiation energy density @xmath46 , the radiative flux @xmath47 , and the radiation pressure @xmath48 in the comoving frame become , respectively , @xmath84 \\nonumber \\\\     & = & -4\\pi \\bar{i } \\frac{4}{3}\\gamma^2 \\beta , \\\\",

    "in this paper , we have derived the relativistic variable eddington factor for a plane - parallel flow that is accelerating in the vertical direction ; we have introduced the one - tau photo - oval observed by the comoving observer , and then calculated the comoving radiation field and the eddington factor for several situations , and found that the eddington factor in the relativistic regime generally depend on the optical depth , the flow velocity , and the velocity gradient .    of these , the dependence of rvef on the optical depth is weak similar to the non - relativistic plane - parallel atmosphere . as for the dependence on the velocity gradient ,",
    "on the other hand , rvef generally decreases as the velocity gradient increases .",
    "when the velocity gradient is small , rvef linearly decreases with the velocity gradient , as proved in fukue ( 2008a ) .",
    "when the velocity gradient becomes large , rvef decreases in the power law manner of the logarithmic velocity gradient ( cf .",
    "fukue 2008b ) . finally , as for the dependence on the relativistic speed , rvef can increases to be on the order of unity , if the comoving intensity is sufficiently anisotropic .",

    "the treatment of the relativistic eddington factor presented in this paper may turn out to be applicable in various aspects of relativistic astrophysics with radiation transfer ; i.e. , black - hole accretion flows with supercritical accretion rates , relativistic jets and winds driven by luminous central objects , relativistic explosions including gamma - ray bursts , neutrino transfers in supernova explosions , and various events occured in the proto universe ( cf .",
