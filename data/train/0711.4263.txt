    "in this section we briefly present some of the basic features of the non - equilibrium quantum field theory based on the in - in , also dubbed schwinger - keldysh , formulation @xcite .",
    "the interested reader is referred to the excellent review by chou _",
    "@xcite for a more exhaustive discussion .",
    "since we need the temporal evolution of quantum correlators with definite initial conditions and not simply the transition amplitude of particle reactions , the ordinary equilibrium quantum field theory at finite temperature is not the appropriate tool .",
    "the most appropriate extension of the field theory to deal with nonequilibrium phenomena amounts to generalizing the time contour of integration to a closed - time path . more precisely , the time integration contour is deformed to run from @xmath88 to @xmath89 and back to @xmath88 .",
    "the ctp formalism ( often dubbed as in - in formalism ) is a powerful green s function formulation for describing non - equilibrium phenomena in field theory .",
    "it allows to describe phase - transition phenomena and to obtain a self - consistent set of quantum boltzmann equations . the formalism yields various quantum averages of operators evaluated in the in - state without specifying the out - state . on the contrary ,",
    "the ordinary quantum field theory ( often dubbed as in - out formalism ) yields quantum averages of the operators evaluated with an in - state at one end and an out - state at the other .",
    "for example , because of the time contour deformation , the partition function in the in - in formalism for a real scalar field is defined to be @xmath90 & = & { \\rm tr}\\ : \\left [ t\\left ( { \\rm exp}\\left[i\\:\\int_c\\:j\\phi\\right]\\right)\\rho\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & = & { \\rm tr}\\:\\left [ t_{+}\\left ( { \\rm exp}\\left [ i\\:\\int\\ : j_{+}\\phi_{+}\\right]\\right ) \\right . \\nonumber\\\\ & \\times&\\left .",
    "t_{-}\\left ( { \\rm exp}\\left [        -i\\:\\int\\:j_{-}\\phi_{-}\\right]\\right ) \\rho\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath91 in the integral denotes that the time integration contour runs from minus infinity to plus infinity and then back to minus infinity again , see fig .",
    "the symbol @xmath92 represents the initial density matrix and the fields are in the heisenberg picture and defined on this closed time contour . sometimes it is more usful to work with other field variables , @xmath93 and @xmath94 . in such a case one",
    "has to properly redefine the sources as @xmath95 and @xmath96 . to identify the physical degrees of freedom",
    ", the normalization of the generating functional @xmath97\\right|_{j_\\delta=0}=1 $ ] has to be imposed .",
    "we must now identify field variables with arguments on the positive or negative directional branches of the time path .",
    "this doubling of field variables leads to six different real - time propagators on the contour @xcite .",
    "these six propagators are not independent , but using all of them simplifies the notation . for a generic bosonic neutral scalar field @xmath5",
    "they are defined as @xmath98 where the last two green functions are the retarded and advanced green functions respectively and @xmath99 is the step function . when computing a loop diagram , one has to assign to the interaction points a plus or a minus sign in all possible manners and sum all the possible diagrams , taking into account that vertices which a minus sign has been assigned to must be multiplied by @xmath100 .          for equilibrium phenomena , the brackets @xmath106 imply a thermodynamic average over all the possible states of the system . while for homogeneous systems in equilibrium , the green functions depend only upon the difference of their arguments @xmath107 and there is no dependence upon @xmath108 , for systems out of equilibrium",
    ", the definition ( [ def1 ] ) has a different meaning .",
    "the concept of thermodynamic averaging is now ill - defined .",
    "instead , the bracket means the need to average over all the available states of the system for the non - equilibrium distributions .",
    "furthermore , the arguments of the green functions @xmath109 are _ not _ usually given as the difference @xmath110 .",
    "for example , non - equilibrium could be caused by transients which make the green functions depend upon @xmath111 rather than @xmath112 .",
    "@xmath113-{\\cal l}[\\phi_-]=\\sqrt{-g}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}g^{\\sigma\\rho}(\\partial_\\sigma\\phi_+\\partial_\\rho\\phi_+ -\\partial_\\sigma\\phi_-\\partial_\\rho\\phi_- ) -\\frac{\\mu}{3!}(\\phi_{+}^3-\\phi_{-}^3 ) \\right).\\ ] ]    we are using the conformal metric @xmath114 , where @xmath115 ( @xmath116 is the conformal time ) is the scale factor during the de sitter stage characterized by a hubble rate @xmath8 .",
    "the interaction term is cubic in the scalar field , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , and @xmath117 has therefore the dimensions of a mass .",
    "since we will be interested in the following in the infra - red divergences , we provide here the expressions for the fourier transformed of the tree level expressions @xmath118 and @xmath119 of the two - point correlation functions @xmath120 and @xmath121 respectively in momentum space for wavelengths larger than the horizon      as an illustrative example of the infra - red divergences , we compute the two - point correlation function @xmath123 . the relevant diagram is given in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] which represents the sum of a set of diagrams whose relative sign is dictated by the appropriate sign of the cubic vertex .        where @xmath11 is the comoving infra - red cut - off which we may set to be equal to @xmath13 , @xmath14 being the value of the scale factor at the beginning of inflation ( the upper limit of integration over the momenta @xmath125 is dictated by the fact that the expression is valid for momenta @xmath126 ) .",
    "notice that the power spectrum @xmath7 of the perturbations of the scalar field @xmath5 is directly related to the correlation function @xmath123 computed at equal times                however , diagrams like the forth one in fig .",
    "( [ fig3 ] ) are not automatically included in this resummation .",
    "this is unfortunate , because they are not subleading .",
    "this is reminiscent of what happens in a @xmath131 theory where , performing a hartree approximation , one is able to resum the all class of `` daisy '' diagrams ; however , unless an @xmath132 symmetry is invoked for large @xmath22 , one has no guarantee that the omitted diagrams are unimportant .    in general , one can hope to resum the large leading logarithms using the standard method of the wilsonian renormalization group ( rg ) techniques developed in quantum field theory and in statistical physics @xcite .",
    "these techniques have been recently applied to resum cosmological perturbations of a collisionless fluid @xcite .",
    "the starting point of this formulation of the renormalization group is a modification of the generic two - point correlation function as follows      where @xmath134 is a high - pass filtering function , which equals unity if @xmath135 and zero if @xmath136 .",
    "the modified generating functional @xmath137 $ ] can be obtained from the expression ( [ path ] ) and describes a fictitious universe in which all fluctuations with momenta smaller than @xmath138 are damped out . in the limit @xmath139",
    "all fluctuations are included and we recover the physical situation . decreasing the cut off , the linear and the nonlinear effects of smaller and smaller fluctuations are gradually taken into account .",
    "this process is described by the rg equation obtained by taking the @xmath138 derivative of @xmath140    @xmath141\\right|_{j_c=0}=- \\frac{i}{2}\\,{\\rm tr}\\,\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta j_\\delta } \\cdot\\lambda\\frac{\\partial } { \\partial\\lambda}(g^\\lambda)^{-1 } \\cdot\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta j_\\delta } \\left .",
    "z_\\lambda[j_c , j_\\delta]\\right|_{j_c=0},\\ ] ]    where the trace stands for integration over momenta and conformal time . differentiating with respect to the source @xmath142 the generating functional @xmath143 , one can easily find the rg equations for the connected green functions .",
    "the exact rg equation at any order in perturbation theory for the two - point correlation function is symbolically given in fig .",
    "[ rge ] where the dots indicated the fully renormalized vertex , the propagators are meant to be fully renormalized and the propagators with the square represents the rg kernel proportional to @xmath144 .",
    "rg methods are particularly suited to physical situations in which there is a separation between the scale where one is supposed to control the fundamental theory ( in our case on subhorizon scales at the beginning of inflation ) and the scale at which the measurements are actually made ( on superhorizon scales at the end of inflation ) .",
    "one can fix the initial conditions for a generic two - point correlation function @xmath145 at the uv scale @xmath146 . in this way",
    ", the correlator receives contributions only from those modes which are still inside the horizon , being @xmath147 the scale factor at which the mode @xmath125 exits the horizon , @xmath148 . in this range of modes",
    "the correlator is supposed to be known and equal to the one given in minkowski spacetime once the renormalization procedure is accounted for and all the parameetrs of the theory have been properly renormalized .",
    "notice that , when computing the correlator for a given external momentum @xmath2 , the uv cut off on the internal momenta will be chosen to be @xmath149 , since one is interested in the effect of the internal superhorizon modes which are well out of the horizon when the mode @xmath2 exits the horizon .",
    "the cut - off scale @xmath138 is then decreased in such a way that more and more momenta corresponding to wavelengths outside the horizon are included .",
    "the cut off scale @xmath138 is decreased till it reaches the smallest momentum which is excited during the de sitter stage , that is up to @xmath150 , where @xmath14 is the scale factor at the beginning of inflation .",
    "this corresponds to the comoving ir cut - off given by @xmath11 .",
    "starting from the fundamental scale , the rg flow describes the gradual inclusion of fluctuations at scales closer and closer to the one relevant to measurements .",
    "the key point is that the new fluctuations which are included at each intermeadiate step feel an effective theory which has been dressed by the fluctuations already included .    the problem with this approach , however , is that the full set of rg equations for @xmath120 and @xmath121 has to be solved as both two - point functions are equally renormalized in the ir .",
    "solving an approximate version of the rg equations corresponds to resum only a given class of diagrams , thus neglecting others which in most cases are not subleading at all .",
    "for instance , in the example developed in this appendix of a cubic theory , neglecting the vertex renormalization and taking free propagators on the right - hand side of the rg equations amounts to resum that class of diagrams which at two - loop is represented by the first three graphs of fig .",
    "the inclusion of equally important diagrams in the ir amounts to solving the full set of rg equations with less and less approximations , making the approach very complicated .",

    "<S> inflationary observables , like the power spectrum , computed at one- and higher - order loop level seem to be plagued by large infra - red corrections . in this short note , we point out that these large infra - red corrections appear only in quantities which are not directly observable . </S>",
    "<S> this is in agreement with general expectations concerning infra - red effects .    </S>",
    "<S> cosmological inflation @xcite has become the dominant paradigm within which one can attempt to understand the initial conditions for cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies and structure formation . in the inflationary picture , </S>",
    "<S> the primordial cosmological perturbations are created from quantum fluctuations which are `` redshifted '' out of the horizon during an early period of accelerated expansion . </S>",
    "<S> once outside the horizon , they remain `` frozen '' until the horizon grows during a later matter- or radiation - dominated era . after falling back inside the horizon </S>",
    "<S> they are communicated to the primordial plasma and hence are directly observable as temperature anisotropies in the cmb . </S>",
    "<S> these anisotropies were first detected by the cosmic background explorer ( cobe ) satellite @xcite , and more recently they have been mapped with spectacular accuracy by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap )  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> these cmb observations show that the cosmological perturbations are very small , of order @xmath0 compared to the homogeneous background . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , one might think that first - order perturbation theory will be adequate for all comparison with observations </S>",
    "<S> . however , that may not be the case ; the planck satellite @xcite and its successors may be sensitive to non - gaussianity ( ng ) in the cosmological perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> such non - gaussianities are sourced by self - interactions in the early universe , and become visible at the level of second- or higher - order perturbation theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this possibility is of considerable interest in its own right and is presently being vigorously explored . </S>",
    "<S> however , there are other equally compelling reasons to go beyond linear theory . </S>",
    "<S> self - interactions of any scalar field during the inflationary stage , and more interestingly of the comoving curvature perturbation @xmath1 , do not _ only _ imply non - gaussian statistics : they also give rise to corrections in all correlators , including the observationally interesting cases of the two- and the three - point correlation functions . </S>",
    "<S> such corrections are associated with so - called `` loops , '' in which virtual particles with arbitrary momentum are emitted and re - absorbed by the fields which participate in the correlation function .    </S>",
    "<S> loop corrections may lead to significant effects @xcite which scale like ( powers of ) the number of e - folds between horizon exit of the mode @xmath2 under consideration and the end of inflation . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it has been known for a long time that there exists a breakdown in the perturbative expansion due to infra - red ( ir ) divergences @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these classical one - loop corrections depend on the total number of e - folds of inflation since they scale like powers of @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the scale factor of the universe @xcite .    to illustrate the appearance of ir divergences </S>",
    "<S> , we can adopt a simple toy model made of a scalar field @xmath5 with cubic interaction @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> this field is not necessarily the scalar field driving inflation . by using the in  in formalism suitable for non - equilibrium field theory </S>",
    "<S> , we can compute the one - loop correction to the power spectrum @xmath7 of the scalar field perturbations in a pure de sitter epoch characterized by a constant hubble rate @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the computation is performed in appendix a , to which the reader is referred for all technical details . </S>",
    "<S> one finds @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the conformal time and @xmath11 is the infra - red comoving momentum cut - off . </S>",
    "<S> one is now faced with the task of determining what value should be assigned to @xmath11 .    </S>",
    "<S> one option is to set @xmath12 to be some comoving length scale which left the horizon many e - folds before the observable universe . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> the smallest possible value of @xmath11 is @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the value of the scale factor at the beginning of inflation . </S>",
    "<S> since the wavelength @xmath15 goes out of the horizon when the scale factor equals @xmath16 , we see that @xmath17 , which is proportional to the total number of e - folds from the beginning of inflation to the time when the mode @xmath2 exits the horizon . </S>",
    "<S> this is the large cumulative ir correction previously alluded to : it gets larger the longer inflation lasts . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the @xmath18 accounts for the the number of e - folds between horizon exit of the mode @xmath2 and , eventually , the end of inflation . </S>",
    "<S> more generally , at the generic @xmath19-th order of perturbation theory , the power spectrum is expected to get corrections growing like @xmath20 .    </S>",
    "<S> faced with these potentially large logarithmic corrections , one may take the road of trying to resum them , for example by using the standard method of the wilsonian renormalization group ( rg ) . </S>",
    "<S> this technique , however , may not be that efficient in practice . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the full set of exact rg equations need to be solved . </S>",
    "<S> approximations inevitably lead to disregarding a set of diagrams which are not at all subleading in the ir . </S>",
    "<S> we refer the reader to the appendix for further discussions about this point .    </S>",
    "<S> more relevantly , before attacking the problem of the large ir corrections , we should first ask ourselves whether they are really present in any physical observable which can be measured . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , one should be suspicious that large effects from infra - red modes are somehow unphysical , because on general grounds we expect the structure within our observable patch of the universe to depend only on its local properties .    </S>",
    "<S> what we would like to point out in this short note is that the large ir corrections appear only in quantities which are _ not directly observable_. although their appearance can not be avoided , they do not themselves have any particular interest unless one wishes to ask more general questions , for instance , what is the probability to find an inflaton field homogeneous enough to lead to the correct temperature anisotropy in the cmb within patches like ours ? </S>",
    "<S> their presence is an indication that we have computed the answer to a question which we can never observe . </S>",
    "<S> when large ir corrections appear , we should instead learn how to change the questions we ask in order to obtain predictions which are genuinely local and apply within our observable patch . </S>",
    "<S> some of these considerations already appeared in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and in the present work we further elaborate them .    let us consider the primordial curvature perturbation computed using the @xmath21 formalism @xcite , where @xmath22 is the number of e - folds from an initial flat hypersurface to a final uniform - density hypersurface . </S>",
    "<S> it is convenient to pick the initial time to be shortly after hubble - exit of the scale over which one is smoothing the relevant physical quantities . </S>",
    "<S> the final slice has to be located before the smoothing scale re - enters the horizon in such a way that the separate universe approach may be employed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the homogenous friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) equations can be used to calculate @xmath22 on large ( super - hubble ) scales .    </S>",
    "<S> assuming for simplicity the presence of a single scalar field @xmath5 , the inflaton , the primordial curvature perturbation @xmath1 is determined by the value of the scalar field on the initial slice @xmath23 where @xmath24 the connected two- and three - point functions of the scalar field are defined by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is related to the power spectrum @xmath27 by @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of a nonvanishing bispectrum @xmath29 accounts ( at this order ) for the possibility that the scalar fluctuations are not gaussian at horizon exit and , for simplicity , we neglect the trispectrum and higher - order connected functions .    </S>",
    "<S> we will restrict ourselves from now on to the power spectrum of the primordial curvature perturbation , @xmath1 , which is a physical observable within our local patch . in order to obtain predictions concerning its properties , </S>",
    "<S> all computations should be done within a comoving box whose present size @xmath30 is not much larger than the present horizon @xmath31 , in order that the answer depend only on local properties of the universe at our position . in the language of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , this may be called a minimal box . </S>",
    "<S> we shall also be obliged to consider a superlarge box , whose comoving size @xmath12 left the horizon right at the beginning of the inflationary stage . </S>",
    "<S> what we would like to stress in the following is that the appearance of large logarithmic ir divergences is a consequence of adopting the superlarge box instead of the minimal one @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we have said that in order to make predictions for @xmath1 , we must compute within a box not much larger than @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> however , although we are free _ in principle _ to carry out the computation within a box of any convenient size , in practice we may be restricted by our inability to compute the relevant correlators . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in chaotic inflation beginning at energy densities close to the planck scale , the original inflationary patch will be exponentially larger than the horizon scale when modes corresponding to the cmb left the hubble radius . </S>",
    "<S> in general , our only choice at present is to compute correlation functions within the entire inflationary region , which constitutes a superlarge box . </S>",
    "<S> however this computation need not have anything to do with the anisotropy in the cmb temperature : the correlation functions within the superlarge box are essentially averages of the correlation functions computed within a horizon - sized box , where the average is taken over all ways one can fit the small box within the superlarge one . </S>",
    "<S> this correlation function will only successfully predict the cmb anistropy if conditions in our universe yield correlators which are very close to those computed by averaging over the superlarge box .    </S>",
    "<S> a special simplification occurs if the universe contains only a single field . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , one knows the conditions leading to the end of inflation and ( providing the background field is sufficiently homogeneous ) one therefore always has the choice to compute in a horizon - sized box . </S>",
    "<S> however , where isocurvature fields are present it will generally be true that these fields assume different values in different regions of the superlarge box . </S>",
    "<S> ( this issue is discussed in more detail below . ) in that case , one does not know _ a priori _ the conditions leading to the end of inflation in each small box , and the only alternative in analytic calculations is to compute in the superlarge box instead .    what is the relationship between the correlation functions in differently sized boxes ? </S>",
    "<S> as one varies the small box within the superlarge one , there will be a slow variation in background quantities such as the hubble parameter @xmath8 , the slow - roll parameters @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and so on , together with all other zero - momentum quantities in the theory . the expectation value in the superlarge box is found by taking averages over these background quantities . if the background quantities exhibit large variations within the superlarge box then these averages will develop significant contributions in the infra - red , associated with wavenumbers between @xmath11 and the inverse size of the small box . on the other hand , we could equally well have obtained the expectation value in the superlarge box by computing the ensemble average from first principles , and using the ergodic theorem to connect this with the spatial average . </S>",
    "<S> these two methods of computation must agree . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we see that large ir divergences are merely associated with large fluctuations in the background fields on scales very much larger than the presently observable region </S>",
    "<S> . these fluctuations may be highly non - gaussian , but because they are restricted to scales enormously larger than any which are accessible to experiment , they are of no observational interest . the presence of such structure on ultra - large scales was anticipated long ago by salopek & bond @xcite .    to strengthen the conclusion that the average @xmath35 coincides with the power spectrum @xmath36 computed within the superlarge box , we follow ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and consider a box of generic size @xmath37 placed within the superlarge box . </S>",
    "<S> we want to show that a quantity such as @xmath38 , and consequently the average of the power spectrum @xmath39 , does not depend upon the scale @xmath40 and is therefore a reasonable candidate for the expectation value within a box of size @xmath12 .    </S>",
    "<S> the curvature perturbation within the box of size @xmath40 is given by the @xmath21 formula , which yields @xmath41 where now @xmath42 we wish to relate this to the same computation performed within the superlarge box , which entails replacing all quantities evaluated within @xmath40 by their equivalents evaluated within @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> this can be accomplished by using the separate universe picture to account for variation in the background field , which gives @xmath43 for the sake of simplicity , let us focus on the contributions to the two - point correlator coming from the bispectrum ( if the scalar field pertubations are gaussian at horizon exit , the proof is contained in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . from ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we may directly read off the contributions to @xmath44 from the bispectrum . </S>",
    "<S> they start at one - loop and up to two - loops they read @xmath45 where only momenta larger than @xmath46 are to be considered because the box introduces periodic boundary conditions , and @xmath47 is the bispectrum of the inflaton within the @xmath40-sized box under consideration . </S>",
    "<S> these contributions are accompanied by terms coming from the power spectrum , as described in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , which we are ignoring here . in any @xmath40-box , </S>",
    "<S> the tree - level contribution to @xmath44 is @xmath48 . within the @xmath12-sized box we can use the separate universe picture to write @xmath49 where a term linear in @xmath50 has been omitted and @xmath51 , @xmath52 are the usual slow - roll parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the term proportional to @xmath53 cancels that part of the running with @xmath40 which is sourced by the omitted power spectrum terms in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ running ] ) , as described in ref .  @xcite . of the remaining terms </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath54 is of the same functional form ( in derivatives of @xmath22 ) as the leading term @xmath55 , but is suppressed by extra slow - roll parameters . </S>",
    "<S> this term will cancel contributions from subleading terms in @xmath56 which are not visible when we compute only to leading order . </S>",
    "<S> therefore this term can be ignored . </S>",
    "<S> the interesting term is the one proportional to @xmath57 , which is of the same functional form in derivatives of @xmath22 as the one - loop term in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ running ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> one must average eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ leading - term ] ) over all possible positions of the @xmath40-sized box within the large box . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ running ] ) runs with @xmath40 . within the @xmath12-sized box , one can write ( in analogy with eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ leading - term ] ) ) @xmath61 where a linear term has again been discarded , and @xmath62 is an abbreviation for the combination @xmath63 in this equation , @xmath64 and @xmath65 are , respectively , the first and second derivatives of the inflaton bispectrum within the @xmath12-sized box with respect to the background field , and all the bispectra are evaluated with arguments @xmath2 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> the leading term in eq .  ( [ one - loop ] ) is proportional to @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> the running of this term comes entirely from differentiating the integral with respect to its limit . using the method of boubekeur & lyth @xcite to estimate the integral , and the squeezed bispectrum computed by allen _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ( see also ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , it follows that this running exactly cancels the running from the term proportional to @xmath69 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ leading - term ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the remaining terms in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ one - loop ] ) , which are described by @xmath62 , acquire running from both the lower limit of the integral , and the background expectation value @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> they are proportional to three copies of @xmath71 and therefore are formally comparable to two - loop corrections . in a full calculation , one should include all two - loop terms and show that the running of the @xmath62 terms correctly cancels that of the two - loop contributions . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the two - loop term written in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ running ] ) and show that its running cancels with the term of the same functional form ( in derivatives of @xmath22 ) in @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> the running imparted to this term by @xmath72 is given by @xmath73 this can be thought of as a renomalization of the classical value of the scalar field as seen inside the small box .    </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the @xmath40-dependence of @xmath74 comes by differentiating the integral with respect to its limit @xmath75 where we have assumed that the relevant physical momenta are much larger than @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution  ( [ aa ] ) cancels two thirds of the running in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ onelooprunning ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining part is associated with `` dressing '' of the @xmath21 coefficients , as described in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is cancelled by a bispectrum term coming from the @xmath76 term in the @xmath21 expansion , leaving zero running overall . </S>",
    "<S> a similar computation may be performed including the trispectrum .    </S>",
    "<S> the computation above confirms that @xmath77 does not depend on the size of the box @xmath40 , as expected on general grounds , and that it coincides with the power spectrum @xmath36 computed in the superlarge box : large ir divergences inevitably appear because what we are computing is in fact @xmath35 , that is the power spectrum on the superlarge box .    one can choose a small box to minimize the two - loop contribution , but this makes the one - loop contribution sensitive to the largest scale @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , in slow - roll models of inflation @xmath78 . it can be shown that @xmath79 which becomes significant for @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , one can try to reduce the one - loop contribution going to the superlarge box , paying the price of a large two - loop contribution . </S>",
    "<S> the point though is that the large ir divergences show up in the average power spectrum and , as we have advocated before , this is not a quantity of physical interest . </S>",
    "<S> it only provides the level of uncertainty inherent in the theoretical predictions .    </S>",
    "<S> if one insists in adopting a superlarge box , it should be kept in mind therefore that the location of our box may be untypical and one should quantify how likely it is that the correlators averaged over the superlarge box coincide with the correlators in our observable universe . to deal with this problem , one can try to use the approach of stochatic inflation . </S>",
    "<S> this embodies the idea that the ir part of the scalar field may be considered as a classical space - dependent stochastic field satisfying a local langevin - like equation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the stochastic noise terms arise from the quantum fluctuations which become classical at horizon crossing and then contribute to the background . </S>",
    "<S> one can derive a fokker - planck equation describing how the probability of scalar field values at a given spatial point evolves with time . </S>",
    "<S> one should split the computations into two steps . </S>",
    "<S> first , the distribution of the values of the scalar field inside the superlarge box should be estimated . </S>",
    "<S> this will allow one to compute the probability @xmath81 that the starting initial condition for the background field is given by @xmath82 in our local observable patch at time @xmath83 , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ when there remain 60 or so e - folds till the end of inflation in that patch . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of the scalar field in the superlage box , due to the ir divergences , will be far from being gaussian . </S>",
    "<S> however , we do expect that in our local patch initial conditions are relatively uniform . from the point of view of our local universe </S>",
    "<S> the ir properties of the superlarge box only enter to provide the probability @xmath81 that the value @xmath84 is achieved in our patch . at later times the field value at a given point </S>",
    "<S> has a distribution given by @xmath85 furthermore , if the scalar field is homogeneously distributed in our local patch @xcite , then @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> the probability @xmath87 is generically highly non - gaussian , because the initial conditions are not gaussian distributed as large ir corrections are present in the superlarge box @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , if we impose the observable constraint in order to select those initial parameters which lead to cmb anisotropies consistent with observations , a severe selection is imposed on initial conditions and we expect a probability close to gaussian . in the stochastic approach , therefore , one trades the uncertainty in the prediction coming from the large ir contributions in the superlarge box for the uncertainty inherent in having a probability distribution for the background quantities . it would be interesting to determine such a probability distribution to evaluate the uncertainty in the theoretical predictions for our local universe .    </S>",
