    "supergravity solutions with fluxes are a rich subject that ranges from the physics of string compactifications and vacua to the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "the geometry of such solutions has recently received much attention .",
    "our improved understanding of this subject reveals that many interesting features are still to be uncovered and that , most likely , new relevant solutions are still to be found . in this paper , using the supersymmetry conditions recently derived in @xcite , we study a class of solutions relevant for the ads / cft correspondence . up to now",
    "only two regular supergravity backgrounds are known that correspond to dual confining @xmath6 sym theories , the klebanov - strassler ( ks @xcite ) and the maldacena - nuez ( mn @xcite ) solutions .",
    "it was suggested in @xcite that the ks solution should belong to a one parameter family of supersymmetric backgrounds describing the baryonic branch of the dual gauge theory .",
    "this expectation was strengthen in @xcite ( gubser - herzog - klebanov , ghk ) by a linearized analysis that exhibits a massless goldstone boson and a first order deformed solution of the equations of motion . in this paper",
    "we will show that there exists indeed a one parameter family of regular supersymmetric deformations of the ks solution .",
    "the supergravity solution also depends on a second parameter , since we are free to add an arbitrary constant to the dilaton .",
    "the two parameters can be interpreted in the dual gauge theory as a baryonic vev and a gauge coupling constant . by varying both parameters",
    ", we find a flow whose endpoint is the mn solution .",
    "the result thus makes justice of the many attempts of finding a supergravity solution interpolating between ks and mn @xcite .",
    "supersymmetry in compactifications without fluxes requires the internal manifold to be a calabi - yau .",
    "the presence of fluxes back - reacts on the geometry transforming the manifold into a generalized calabi - yau @xcite . in particular , since supersymmetry requires the existence of at least a nonvanishing spinor , the internal manifold must have an @xmath7 structure .",
    "a set of general conditions that preserve supersymmetry is known for type ii theories . in type iib theories",
    ", the internal manifold must be complex @xcite .",
    "in addition to this , supersymmetry implies a set of linear conditions on the @xmath7 torsions and the fluxes @xcite .",
    "we will apply these supersymmetric constraints to an ansatz for the metric and fluxes proposed by papadopoulos and tseytlin ( pt @xcite ) , which contains both the ks and mn solutions .",
    "we will find that , quite amazingly , the apparently overdetermined set of equations admits a class of solutions .",
    "all unknown functions in the ansatz are explicitly determined in terms of two quantities for which we provide a system of coupled first - order differential equations .",
    "the mn and ks backgrounds and the linearized deformation of ks found in @xcite are particular solutions of these equations . more generally , by a numerical and power series analysis",
    ", we can show that there is a one parameter family of regular solutions that deforms ks , while preserving an @xmath8 symmetry .",
    "we can extend the solution symmetrically with respect to ks , but the two branches are related by a @xmath9 symmetry .    from the field theory perspective , the ks solution is known to represent an @xmath10 @xmath6 gauge theory undergoing a cascading series of seiberg dualities that decreases the number of colors and terminates with a single @xmath11 gauge group . in the last step of the cascade ,",
    "the gauge theory is @xmath12 and has a moduli space of vacua that include a baryonic branch .",
    "the moduli space is labeled by a complex parameter and has a @xmath9 symmetry .",
    "it was proposed in @xcite that the ks solution should describe the symmetric point on this branch .",
    "our family of solutions , which preserves @xmath8 and has a @xmath9 symmetry , is the natural candidate for describing the full baryonic branch of the gauge theory .",
    "an analysis of the uv asymptotic reveals that the set of operators that are acquiring a vev is compatible with this interpretation .",
    "moreover , the analysis of the ir behavior of the metric shows that the physics of confinement is the same as described in @xcite .",
    "in particular , the ratio of string tensions @xcite smoothly interpolates between the known cases of ks and mn @xcite .",
    "the existence of a family of regular solutions describing the moduli space of a gauge theory is particularly significant .",
    "all other attempts of deforming a known solution along a moduli space always gave rise to singular backgrounds .",
    "for instance , solutions dual to the coulomb branch of vacua in @xmath13 or @xmath14 theories contain singularities corresponding to distributions of branes for whose resolution stringy effects are usually invoked @xcite .",
    "the solution presented here is the first example of gauge theory which can be described in a controllable way along its moduli space . only for large values of the baryonic vev",
    "the supergravity solution becomes strongly coupled .",
    "moving along the baryonic branch implies fixing the boundary conditions for the dilaton . by varying also the string coupling",
    ", our solution smoothly interpolates between ks and mn .",
    "all the backgrounds along this flow have the uv asymptotic behavior of the ks solution , except for the extremal value of the interpolating parameter , where it suddenly changes , the dilaton blows up and we recover the mn solution . through this paper",
    ", we will refer to this solution as the `` interpolating flow '' . from the field theory point of view",
    ", we can reach the mn point by varying both the baryonic vev and a coupling constant .",
    "we have also explicitly checked that the equations of motions are automatically satisfied by the first order system of susy equations we derived .",
    "we are therefore sure that the one parameter family of solutions we have found are true solutions of type iib supergravity .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we review the supersymmetry conditions for type iib solutions with @xmath7 structure . in section 3",
    "we present the pt ansatz and we discuss the choice of complex structure on the manifold .",
    "we give the general solution of the supersymmetry conditions and we show how the known cases ( mn , ks and ghk ) fit in it .",
    "the details of the derivation are reported in the appendices . in section 4",
    "we discuss the family of regular solutions that interpolates between ks and mn .",
    "finally , in section 5 , we compare our results with the field theory expectations .",
    "we are interested in type iib backgrounds with non - zero rr fluxes and where the space - time is a warped product of the form @xmath15 ds^2= e^2a _",

    "the manifold @xmath17 to have a globally defined invariant spinor .",
    "this is possible only for manifolds that have reduced structure .",
    "the structure group of a manifold is the group of transformations required to patch the orthonormal frame bundle .",
    "a six dimensional riemannian manifold has automatically so(6 ) structure . in order to preserve supersymmetry ,",
    "the structure group of @xmath17 should be a subgroup of so(6 ) .",
    "in general , the smaller the group , the bigger the number of supercharges of the effective four dimensional theory . to preserve minimal supersymmetry ( @xmath6 in four dimensions )",
    "the structure group should be at most su(3 ) .",
    "the set of supersymmetry conditions for iib backgrounds with su(3)-structure was derived in @xcite .",

    "structure to become su(3 ) holonomy is measured by the intrinsic torsion . in terms of su(3 ) representations , the intrinsic torsion has @xmath24 components which are defined as follows : @xmath25 @xmath26 is a complex zero  form in @xmath27 , @xmath28 is a complex primitive two  form , so it lies in @xmath29 , @xmath30 is a real primitive @xmath31 form in the @xmath32 , @xmath33 is a real one - form in @xmath34 , @xmath33 and @xmath35 in the complex basis as @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 . ] and finally @xmath39 is a complex @xmath40-form ( notice that in ( [ eq : djdo ] ) the @xmath41 part drops out ) , so its degrees of freedom are again @xmath34 .",

    "similarly all the fluxes in the theory can be decomposed in su(3 ) representations @xmath45    using group theory it is then possible to reduce the supersymmetry conditions on the variations of the fermions to a set of algebraic equations for the different su(3 ) components of the torsion and the fluxes     1 & w_1 & h^(1 ) & f_3^(1 ) + 3 & w_4 , w_5 & h^(3 ) & f_1^(3 ) , f_3^(3 ) , f_5^(3 ) + 6 & w_3 & h^(6 ) & f_3^(6 ) + 8 8 & w_2 & - & - +    table 1 : decomposition of torsion and fluxes in su(3 ) representations .",

    "therefore we get the first basic fact about iib backgrounds with su(3 ) structure - they necessarily involve complex manifolds @xcite : w_1= w_2=0 . [ condcomp ]    in order to write down the conditions for the @xmath50 and @xmath51 components we need to consider the decomposition of the ten - dimensional supersymmetry parameter in terms of the four - dimensional one and the su(3)-invariant spinor .",

    "moreover , by varying also the string coupling constant ( that is by moving also in the space of theories ) we can smoothly connect the ks and mn solutions . it would be interesting to understand what is the physical meaning of this intepolating flow .    to find these solutions we made use of two tools : the interpolating ansatz for the metric and the fluxes due to papadopoulos and tseytlin @xcite and the supersymmetry conditions obtained in @xcite .",
    "let us make a few comments about the ansatz , the method , and the solutions .    as always , the first order supersymmetry equations are easier to solve than the equations of motion , and that is what we are doing here . from the other side , as it is well known , supersymmetry by itself does not guarantee a solution , and bianchi identities plus the equations of motion for the fluxes have to be imposed .",
    "typically it is difficult to find solutions of the supersymmetry conditions that satisfy also the bianchi identities . in pt ansatz the fluxes are constructed in such a way that bianchi identities are automatically satisfied and we have explicitly checked that , for our solution , the supersymmetry conditions imply the equations of motions .",
    "the use of su(3 ) structures allows not simply to deal in a systematic way with the first order equations , but breaks everything into few basic representations and works representation by representation .",
    "the pt ansatz together with the su(3 ) structure ( or spinorial ) ansatz still have 13 undetermined functions ; our solution uses all of these . while the system of equations appears to be heavily overdetermined , there are many simplifications and eventually we were able to find simple analytical expressions for all the functions in terms of the solutions of two coupled differential equations .",
    "we solved these differential equations in power series for small and large radius , having thus the ir and uv asymptotics of the full solution .",
    "although supersymmetry did not forbid it , it was unclear that regular solutions with su(3 ) structure besides ks and mn existed ( as far as polchinski - strassler , we expect the exact solution to have su(2 ) structure ) . realizing that ghk has su(3 ) structure is a first step .",
    "here we see that the full one - parameter family of solutions respects the su(3 ) structure of the extrema .",
    "this was a pleasant surprise , which points toward a rich structure in the space of regular @xmath6 supersymmetric solutions with fluxes .",
    "as the su(3 ) structure stays intact , throughout the family there is a well - defined three form @xmath20 without zeros such that @xmath300 .",
    "moreover we can see quite explicitly that in accordance with the general conditions for preserving @xmath6 supersymmetry we can shift @xmath35 away by scaling @xmath20 and get a closed three - form ( pure spinor ) , and thus a family of generalized calabi  yau manifolds .",
    "we give the set of algebraic and differential equations governing the system .",
    "although the full analytical solution is still missing , the power expansion for small radius proves the existence of a one parameter family of regular solutions .",
    "all arbitrary constants in the solution are fixed in terms of one integration constant ( plus another constant for the dilaton ) which is the parameter along the flow .",
    "the flow parameter is allowed to take values in an interval that can be split into two regions related by a @xmath9 symmetry . in the interpolating",
    "flow the ks solution corresponds to the fixed point of this symmetry , while the mn solution is attained at the extremal point of the interval .",
    "the analysis of the asymptotic uv behavior shows that the whole family behaves like ks at large radius , except at the extremal mn point , where the uv behavior changes suddenly ( for example , the dilaton blows up in the uv ) .    from the gauge theory point of view",
    ", our family of solutions describes the baryonic branch of the confining vacua @xcite .",
    "indeed , the large radius behavior of the supergravity fields suggests that our solutions have an extra non - zero vev with respect to ks for the @xmath9 odd operator @xmath301 .",
    "this behavior confirms some expectations about the ir physics of ks @xcite : for example they are not in the same ir universality class as the pure glue @xmath6 gauge theory , they are rather in a phase where there is confinement without mass gap .    as usual , with the supergravity solution at hand we can make qualitative and quantitative predictions on the strongly coupled regime of the dual gauge theory .",
    "finding the supergravity dual of the pure glue @xmath6 gauge theory remains a challenge , though , which means that the study of supergravity backgrounds with fluxes is far from being exhausted .",
