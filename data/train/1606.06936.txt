    "piezoelectric materials draw from their internal structure their fundamental ability to generate a net charge displacement when they are deformed and to respond mechanically to an electric forcing . this two - way electro - mechanical coupling may be exploited to convert the mechanical energy of a vibrating structure into electrical form , and has become increasingly popular to design energy harvesters based on ambient vibrations  @xcite .",
    "such systems critically depend on existing or forced vibrations of the structure .",
    "the concept can nevertheless be extended to harvest energy from a steady flow by exploiting fluid - solid instabilities to generate self - sustained motions of a solid body  @xcite .",
    "the spontaneous flapping of thin deformable plates in axial flow beyond a critical flow velocity is another example , commonly referred to as the flag instability ( see the recent review in ref .",
    "this instability has been the focus of intense recent investigations to understand the impact of energy extraction on the flapping dynamics  @xcite and assess the energy harvesting performance when the flag s deformation is converted into electric energy using piezoelectric and other electroactive materials covering the flag s surface  @xcite .",
    "much of the work on piezoelectric flags has so far focused on single flags connected with simple circuits , such as pure resistors , to understand the effect of the fluid - solid - electric coupling on the system s stability and the energy transfers between the fluid , solid and electrical components  @xcite . ref .",
    "@xcite further showed that the flapping amplitude and frequency of a piezoelectric flag can be significantly modified by the extraction of energy and coupling to the dynamical properties of the output circuit even for a purely resistive output . using a resonant circuit , ref .",
    "@xcite reported a frequency lock - in phenomenon that considerably increases the flag s flapping amplitude and efficiency : during lock - in , the flapping frequency of the flag is dictated by the circuit to match its resonance frequency therefore enabling large voltage and energy transfers to the output load .",
    "because of its material properties , a single piezoelectric harvester is still characterized by its small power output @xcite .",
    "one potential solution to this problem is to combine multiple devices in order to produce the required power . for flapping flags",
    ", however , the placement in close proximity of multiple flapping structures significantly modifies their flapping dynamics , and hydrodynamic synchronization as well as modification of the flapping amplitude and frequency have been reported in multiple recent studies  @xcite .",
    "depending on their relative positioning , two side - by - side flags may flap in - phase ( with identical vertical displacements ) , or out - of - phase ( with opposite vertical displacement )  @xcite .",
    "more complex synchronization was also identified in numerical simulations for both side - by - side and tandem flags  @xcite .",
    "the synchronization of the flags can modify their individual dynamical properties and their individual performance as energy harvesters .",
    "furthermore , if the flags are to be connected electrically to a single device , for example to increase the available power , the relative phase and amplitude of the generated signals ( directly related to their mechanical dynamics ) will be critical : the electric interaction might be constructive ( resp .",
    "destructive ) if both signals are in - phase ( resp .",
    "out - of - phase ) .",
    "hydrodynamic coupling therefore influences the efficiency of flags that are electrically - isolated  @xcite .",
    "finally , the inverse piezoelectric effect introduces a feedback forcing on the flags dynamics by the electrical circuit : when multiple flags are connected to the same output loop , this introduces an additional electrodynamic coupling that competes with hydrodynamic effects in setting the relative phase and dynamical properties of the flapping motion .",
    "the motivation for the present work is therefore to investigate the role and relative weight of these different coupling mechanisms and the resulting harvesting efficiency of coupled piezoelectric flags . to this end , we focus on the system consisting of two flags placed side - by - side in an axial flow and connected to a single output circuit , a simple fluid - solid - electric system which provides physical insight on the hydro- and electro - dynamic couplings and performance of a two - flag assembly . in section  [ sec : model ] , the models used to describe the fluid - solid - electric dynamics are presented .",

    "when dominant , we have demonstrated that the latter has two main consequences : because of the inverse piezoelectric effect it can force a particular synchronization of the flags ( either in - phase or out - of - phase depending on the connection used ) , and the resulting synchronization leads to an additive forcing of the two flags on the output circuit leading to a larger efficiency .",
    "two factors have been identified to influence the relative importance of hydrodynamic and electrodynamic coupling : ( i ) the distance between the flags @xmath80 and ( ii ) the nature of the output circuit .",
    "the former does not impact electrodynamics but directly impacts the intensity of the hydrodynamic coupling : at larger distances , the flow perturbations introduced by one flag near the other become negligible .",
    "hence , at larger distances hydrodynamic effects become subdominant and the flags synchronization is driven by electrodynamic interactions .",
    "the output circuit also plays an important role : higher voltage in the output loop increases the piezoelectric feedback forcing on the structure and effectively increases electrodynamic coupling .",
    "resonant circuits are therefore able to trigger electrodynamic synchronization of the flags at much shorter distances than resistive circuits .",
    "we exclusively focused here on the interaction of two side - by - side flags for which hydrodynamics introduce a symmetric coupling between the flags .",
    "other configurations deserve further scrutiny , in particular tandem flags : one flag is placed in the wake of the other , breaking the hydrodynamic coupling s scrutiny as the downstream flag experiences a much stronger forcing for its relative phase of flapping .",
    "this downstream flag also experiences a larger flapping amplitude @xcite , which is beneficial from an energy harvesting point of view . in that configuration ,",
    "electrodynamic coupling is likely to be subdominant ; it is therefore expected that much of the energy harvesting performance can be inferred from the pure hydrodynamic coupling problem .",
    "our results show that a strong electrodynamic coupling is beneficial to the energy harvesting performance as it sets a particular synchronization in which the forcing of the flags on the circuit interact constructively .",
    "a possible route for improvement of the system s efficiency therefore lies within the circuit itself , for example using active circuits engineering such as synchronized switch harvesting on inductor ( sshi ) to effectively synchronize the mechanical and electrical systems and enhance energy transfers  @xcite .",
    "the synchronization of more than two flags finally offer further opportunities and challenges . as demonstrated here",
    ", the relative position of the flags plays a critical role in setting their relative phase through hydrodynamic interactions . for larger flag assemblies",
    ", more complex phase distributions can be achieved  @xcite .",
    "in - depth understanding of such synchronization is however needed in order to assess the interest of such assemblies for energy harvesting purposes .",
