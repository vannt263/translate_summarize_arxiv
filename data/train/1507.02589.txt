    "einstein s general relativity  @xcite , the currently accepted theory of gravitation , does not distinguish between particles and antiparticles .",
    "strictly speaking , general relativity deals only with masses and light , leaving gravitational interaction of particles , antiparticles , or photons to be established in quantum gravity theory  @xcite .",
    "hence , observations of antiparticle gravitation could serve as an experimental input for quantum gravity  @xcite . additional motivations for such investigation are the still unexplained matter - dominant universe  @xcite and the connection of antimatter s possible anti - gravity  @xcite to the accelerated expansion of the universe  @xcite",
    ". one can also think about a possible particle - antiparticle gravitational asymmetry from an analogy to electroweak interactions , where a photon s massive partners , w and z bosons , are considered responsible for space and charge parity violations  @xcite .",
    "thus , possible massive or lower spin gravitons could introduce similar violations  @xcite that may remain hidden at low energies and will become detectable at high energies .",
    "indirect observations of matter - antimatter gravitational asymmetry involve nuclei with different content of quark - antiquarks in the equivalence principle e@xmath0tv@xmath0s type experiments  @xcite . using @xmath1 conservation the observed stringent limits for the equivalence principle violating matter could be expanded to a limit below @xmath2 for the matter - antimatter low energy gravitational asymmetry  @xcite . technical difficulties for charged antiparticle s",
    "gravitational coupling direct measurements turned physicists attention to neutral antimatter tests  @xcite which may deliver conclusive results soon . the ongoing experiments ,",
    "however , are still at low energy , and massive gravitons interactions may remain unseen .    in this letter",
    "i will demonstrate an extreme sensitivity of a high energy process - laser compton scattering - to an antiparticle s hypothetical anti - gravity and gravitational charge parity violation .",
    "next , applying the developed formalism to the existing data of the hera compton polarimeter , i will compare the @xmath3-spectra generated by electrons and positrons to measure the charge asymmetry for their gravitational interaction .",
    "systematic effects and prospects for other tests will be discussed at the end .",
    "in an earlier publication , high energy compton scattering sensitivity has been shown to a planck scale refractive and birefringent vacuum model  @xcite .",
    "subsequently , i applied the same formalism to the earth s gravity assuming the real gravitational field induced dispersion only for the compton photons  @xcite .",
    "the dispersion , however , also affects the leptons involved in the scattering  @xcite in agreement with the equivalence principle .",
    "this makes the ref .",
    "@xcite conclusions about the general relativity violation invalid  @xcite .    here",
    "i follow the formalism developed by evans et al .",
    "@xcite to find a massive particle s energy - momentum or dispersion relation in a static and isotropic gravitational field described by the schwarzschild metric .",
    "combining the eq.(3 ) and eq.(30 ) from the reference @xcite , for the earth s weak field , one can derive a dispersion relation @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the gravitational constant and @xmath6 are energy , momentum , velocity of the particle ( @xmath7 is assumed throughout the letter ) .",
    "this relation is also valid for massless particles .",
    "indeed , at @xmath8 it describes the photon refraction in a gravitational field in a form derived by many authors ; see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein , or for a more recent reference , see ref .",
    "@xcite .    to allow departure from the equivalence principle",
    "let us retain the interaction strength @xmath5 for matter particles and use a different strength @xmath9 for antimatter leptons to write eq.([disp ] ) for positrons in the following form @xmath10 with .",
    "for an anti - gravitating positron .",
    "using energy - momentum conservation with eq.([disp ] ) and eq.([disp1 ] ) , when in the earth s gravitational field a photon scatters off a positron with energy @xmath11 , the compton scattering kinematics is given by @xmath12 where , with @xmath3 and @xmath13 being the lorentz factor and mass of the initial positron , respectively .",
    "the initial photon s energy and angle are denoted by @xmath14 and @xmath15 , while the dispersion of eq.([disp ] ) is in effect for the scattered photon with energy @xmath16 and angle @xmath17 ; the angles are defined relative to the initial positron .",
    "this kinematic expression is derived for weak gravity and high energies , i.e. , the @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 terms are neglected . to determine the outgoing photon s maximal energy , eq.([comp0 ] )",
    "is solved for @xmath16 at @xmath21 with the following result : @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "thus , in high energy compton scattering the factor @xmath25 is amplified by @xmath26 , allowing one to measure it by detecting the extreme energy of the scattered photons @xmath27 , or positrons ( compton edge ) .    in order to estimate the method",
    "s sensitivity , i calculate the compton edge for an incident photon energy 2.32  ev ( the widely popular green laser ) at different energies of the accelerator leptons . the resulting dependencies for a matter ( electron ) gravity and antimatter ( positron ) anti - gravity are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .     the maximal energy of compton scattered photons ( compton edge ) and its dependence on the initial lepton energy for a head - on collision with 532 nm laser light . solid and dotted lines correspond to matter gravity ( electron , @xmath5 ) and antimatter anti - gravity ( positron , -g ) respectively .",
    "names of @xmath28 accelerators are printed at the upper part . ]",
    "the plot shows considerable sensitivity , which grows toward high energies in a range available to accelerating laboratories . for handling measurement s systematic errors , from an experimental point of view , it is more precise to measure a relative asymmetry rather than absolute compton edge energy",
    ". therefore , we form an asymmetry of compton edges measured on positrons ( @xmath29 ) and electrons ( @xmath30 ) @xmath31 and use eq.([comp0 ] ) to find the charge parity gravitational violation magnitude @xmath32",
    "the high - energy accelerators where laser compton facilities have been operated for years , are listed on the upper energy scale of fig .",
    "as can be seen from the plot , 6  gev storage rings have low sensitivity while the higher energy colliders ( hera , slc , lep ) have a great potential for detecting gravity related energy shifts .",
    "this is true for the hera and slc compton polarimeters but not for the lep polarimeter , which has generated and registered many photons per machine pulse  @xcite . in this multi - photon regime ,",
    "any shift of the compton edge is convoluted with the laser - electron luminosity and can - not be disentangled and measured separately . unlike the lep , the slc polarimeter operated in multi - electron mode and analyzed the energies of interacted leptons using a magnetic spectrometer  @xcite . however , at slc only the electron beam was polarized , and positron data are missing .",
    "hence , we turn to hera , which have recorded compton measurements for both the electrons and the positrons . at the hera transverse polarimeter compton photons are registered by a calorimeter in single particle counting mode . a recorded compton spectrum produced by @xmath33 nm laser scattering on @xmath34 electrons , from ref.@xcite ,",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] superimposed on a background bremsstrahlung distribution .",
    "hera polarimeter compton @xmath3-spectrum produced by laser scattering on @xmath34 electrons , on top of background bremsstrahlung with fit results .",
    "the inset displays the background subtracted compton spectrum .",
    "vertical lines show measured values of the compton ( @xmath27 ) and bremsstrahlung ( @xmath35 ) maximal energies . ]",
    "in contrast to compton scattering , in the bremsstrahlung process the momentum transfer is not fixed , and any small dispersive effect is smeared out and becomes negligible  @xcite .",
    "hence , following the analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite , i calibrate the energy scale according to the maximal bremsstrahlung energy which is found by fitting a convolution of parent energy distribution @xmath36 with the detector response gaussian function , @xmath37 to the bremsstrahlung spectrum . @xmath38 and @xmath39 in the fitting function denote the calorimeter resolution and detected photon s energy respectively while the normalizing factor @xmath40 and maximal energy @xmath41 are free fitting parameters . the same fitting function with the bremsstrahlung parent distribution replaced by the compton scattering differential cross - section @xmath42",
    "is applied to the background subtracted spectrum to find the compton edge at  gev .",
    "the fit results together with fit quality estimates are shown in fig .",
    "more details about the analysis and experimental setup can be found in the ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the same analysis procedure is applied to a hera polarimeter compton spectrum that was generated with @xmath43 positrons and has been reproduced in fig .",
    "8 of ref .",
    "the resulting plots with fit quality outcomes are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .     a similar plot to fig .  [ fig2 ] for positrons with energy @xmath43 .",
    "the compton edge energy for anti - gravitating positrons is indicated by a vertical line @xmath44 . ]    comparing the obtained compton edge  gev with the photons maximal energy for the anti - gravitating positrons @xmath45  gev , derived from eq.([comp ] ) , one can conclude without any advanced systematic error analysis that anti - gravity for the positrons is ruled out .    since the spectra for electrons and positrons",
    "are detected with the same experimental setup , i.e. with the same laser , geometry and detector , both measurements will experience the same systematic influences that will cancel out or reduce greatly in the asymmetry of eq.([asym ] ) .",
    "hence , we omit systematic corrections or errors described in the refs .",
    "@xcite and use only the quoted statistical errors for the @xmath30 , @xmath29 to obtain a positron - electron compton edge asymmetry .    in order to account for the different energies of accelerated electrons and positrons @xmath46 and @xmath47 gev ,",
    "the measured maximal energies in the asymmetry calculation have been normalized to @xmath48 and @xmath49  gev for the electrons and positrons , respectively .",
    "these are the expected compton edge values from eq.([comp ] ) in the absence of gravitational anomaly , at @xmath50 . normalization uncertainty associated with the laser and lepton beam energy spread",
    "is included in the asymmetry error .",
    "inserting the asymmetry into eq.([dgog ] ) , we obtain a measured charge parity gravitational violation value @xmath51 which differs from zero within a @xmath52 confidence .",
    "the obtained negative sign corresponds to a weaker gravitational coupling for the positrons relative to the electrons .",
    "applying a gravitational field - induced dispersion and assuming an equivalence principle violation in a general form @xmath53 for positrons , an outstanding sensitivity has been demonstrated for the high energy compton scattering to such gravitational anomaly . within the developed formalism ,",
    "the hera compton polarimeter s recorded spectra with electrons and positrons strongly disfavor the positron s anti - gravity and show a significant deviation of the @xmath53 from zero .",
    "the last claim is based on a detected @xmath54 energy asymmetry , which is a large number compared to the laser and lepton beam energy relative uncertainty of @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "the remaining source of a possible systematic energy error is the detector that is eliminated from final result by using the asymmetry instead of absolute energy measurements .",
    "however , additional uncorrelated systematic errors may impair the outcome and , claiming a definite observation of charge parity violation at high energy gravitational interactions would require the following :          in the absence of these , the measured electron - positron asymmetry could only be called a hint for the gravitational symmetry breaking and an invitation for further studies .",
    "new experiments , however , will require future @xmath57 machines with sufficiently high @xmath3 or a precise setup on the currently running 6  gev accelerator petra - iii with the highest positron energy available .",
    "anyway , it is worth the efforts since high energy violation of the equivalence principle and gravitational charge parity could reveal an interaction to massive or lower spin gravitons with a possible relation to dark matter or energy .",
