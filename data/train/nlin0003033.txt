    "magnetic billiards on the plane have been considered in many works @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and on the hyperbolic plane in @xcite .",
    "the study of such billiards is strongly motivated by mesoscopic physics , where such billiard models are used as simplified version of the mesoscopic devices in the presence of magnetic fields . in the present paper",
    "we treat the magnetic billiards simultaneously on all surfaces of constant curvature ( sphere , plane and hyperbolic plane ) . for all values of @xmath1 and @xmath2",
    "we establish a common criterion for hyperbolicity of the billiard dynamics , whose geometric realization depends only on the type of linearized dynamics ( geometric optics ) on @xmath0 .",

    "on the plane the neighboring trajectories separate only linearly with time , so that the motion of the point mass between collisions with the boundary is neutral .",
    "exponential separation of billiard trajectories can only occur if the successive reflections from the boundaries introduce sufficient instability . on the hyperbolic plane the negative curvature induces exponential divergence of geodesics .",
    "thus , the boundary of hyperbolic billiard can be neutral ( i. e. , with zero curvature ) , and the chaotic dynamics will be provided by the metric . on the sphere , in contrast , any two geodesics intersect twice at focal points .",
    "thus , the boundary reflections have to compensate for the focusing effect of the sphere , in order to produce chaotic dynamics .",
    "we will call the mentioned above types of linearized dynamics arising on the plane , hyperbolic plane and sphere as _ parabolic _ , _ hyperbolic _ and _ elliptic _ respectively .    in the presence of a constant magnetic field , an additional focusing effect appears . to simplify matters ,",
    "let us discuss first the planar case when @xmath5 .",
    "consider an infinitesimal beam of trajectories which emerges from the same point at the time @xmath7 ( fig .",
