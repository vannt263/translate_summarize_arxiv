    "for a long time the restricted three body problem ( r3bp ) which studies the dynamics of a massless particle moving under the gravitational force produced by two massive bodies in circular orbits around their center of mass , has been studied to know preliminary orbits in some space missions , it is worth mentioning works like @xcite , @xcite , @xcite where the authors used this model to design trajectories of a spacecraft for some spatial missions . in recent years",
    ", the exploration of the trojan asteroids was recognized by the 2013 decadal survey , which includes trojan tour and rendezvous , among the new frontiers missions in the decade 2013 - 2022 .",
    "we refer by trojan asteroid as an small body in a equilateral triangle configuration with other two bodies if they are viewed in a rotating frame of reference .",
    "the most famous examples of trojan asteroids in our solar system are the trojan asteroids of the sun - jupiter system , these groups of asteroids can be divided into two large groups , commonly named the ` trojans ' and the ` greeks ' .",
    "the first group is centered at a point on jupiter s orbit around the sun at @xmath3 behind the planet , and the second group is centered at a point on the same orbit at @xmath3 ahead the planet ; therefore each of the two points forms an equilateral triangle configuration with the sun and jupiter .",
    "it is worth mentioning that there exist other trojan asteroids in our solar system , for instance in the mars - sun and neptune - sun systems , saturn and some of its moons form equilateral triangle configurations , saturn ",
    "telesto , saturn  tethys",
    " calypso or saturn  dione ",
    "helen are good examples of such configuration , therefore such triangle configurations are common in our solar system .",
    "now , if we consider a small particle interacting with the three particles in this configuration , a four body approach becomes necessary .",
    "in several works like @xcite @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite the authors have studied the dynamics of the infinitesimal particle , the so called restricted four body problem ( r4bp ) . however , in this paper we consider the hill s approximation approach in the restricted four - body problem , such approximation was introduced by j. burgos - garcia and m. gidea in @xcite .",
    "this new approach describes the dynamics of a massless particle in a neighborhood of a small mass at one of the vertices of a lagrange central configuration .",
    "the system produced , hereafter refereed as hill four body problem ( h4bp ) , provides an approximation of the motion of the massless particle in an @xmath4-neighborhood of @xmath5 , the remaining masses @xmath6 and @xmath7 are sent at infinite distance through the rescaling , furthermore , if we let @xmath8 in our model , the resulting system coincides with the classical lunar hill problem , so the h4bp is a generalization in this sense . in @xcite",
    "the authors pointed out the main differences between the classical and the generalized problem , in particular the existence of two additional equilibrium points , the so called @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "these points have the property that there exists a value of the mass parameter @xmath11 for which such equilibrium points are linearly stable if @xmath12 and they are unstable for @xmath13 , when @xmath14 we have two pure imaginary eigenvalues of multiplicity two .",
    "this property will have remarkable consequences in the exploration of the periodic orbits which is the main objective of this work .    between the possible applications of the planar periodic orbits of this system",
    ", we can consider the families of these periodic orbits as starting point for the design of spacecraft trajectories near a trojan asteroid of the solar system , or as preliminary orbits for modelling the dynamics of the particles in the so called e - ring of saturn where the systems saturn ",
    "telesto , saturn  tethys ",
    "calypso are contained @xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain a first insight of the dynamics of the massless particle in such systems , an exploration of the families of periodic orbits of the system is required .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we introduce the hill four body problem , we state the equations of motion , their properties and the hamiltonian of the system . in section 3 we recall the results regarding the equilibrium points of the system , however , we offer a deep study of the linear dynamics around the new equilibrium points produced by the presence of the second massive body , as we will see , such equilibrium points are linearly stable and they provide new families of periodic orbits that are not present in the classical hill s problem . in section 4",
    "we discuss the so called levi - civita regularization of the system , such regularization has been already discussed in @xcite , however , we offer more details regarding the regularized equations , this study of the regularized equations will prove to be useful in the numerical computations . in section 5",
    "we show the numerical explorations of the families of periodic orbits in the h4bp , we show the geometry of the orbits , their qualitative behaviour respect to the variations of the jacobi constant and the evolution of their stability .",
    "in @xcite the authors introduced the h4bp by studying the limit when @xmath15 in the hamiltonian of the r4bp .",
    "the procedure was similar to that in @xcite , first , a symplectic scaling depending on @xmath0 was performed in the hamiltonian , second , an expansion in the gravitational potential of the hamiltonian as a power series in @xmath16 in a neighborhood of the small mass @xmath17 , then studying the behavior of the hamiltonian in the limit as @xmath18 .",
    "the result of the cited procedure produces the following theorem whose proof can be found in the page 6 of @xcite .",
    "[ main theorem ] after the symplectic scaling @xmath19 the limit @xmath15 of the hamiltonian ( [ originalhamiltonian ] ) restricted to a neighborhood of @xmath17 exists and yields a new hamiltonian @xmath20where @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "we note that the resulting hamiltonian is a three - degree of freedom system depending on a parameter @xmath2 which becomes equal to the mass of the secondary  @xmath23 . as it was pointed out in the introduction , this systems represents a kepler problem , for the infinitesimal mass and the so called asteroid , plus quadratic terms produced by the gravitational influence of the two large bodies . in this sense ,",
    "the current system represents a gravitational generalization of the classical hill s problem , i.e. , when we consider @xmath24 in hamiltonian ( [ hillhamiltonian ] ) , we recover the system of the hill s problem .",
    "this is not obvious at first sight , however if we apply a rotation in the @xmath25-plane we obtain a new hamiltonian with nicer properties , in particular , in these coordinates we recover the original hill s problem .",
    "[ main corollary ] the equations of motion given by ( [ hillhamiltonian ] ) are equivalent , via a rotation , with the system @xmath26 with @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the eigenvalues corresponding to the rotation transformation in the @xmath25-plane with @xmath30 .",
    "the system possesses a jacobi type first integral given by the expression @xmath31    where @xmath32 is a constant .",
    "the expressions for @xmath33 and @xmath34 have the following properties @xmath35 these properties state that the equations ( [ finalequations ] ) are invariant under the transformations @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 as a consequence we have the well known symmetry respect the @xmath42-axis .",
    "a similar argument shows that the equations ( [ finalequations ] ) are also symmetric respect the @xmath43-axis .",
    "therefore , we have the well known symmetries of the classical hill s problem that can be recovered by considering @xmath24 , in such a case , the equations ( [ finalequations ] ) take the form @xmath44 with @xmath45 exactly as in the classical hill problem , see @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian in these new coordinates is given by the expression @xmath46 where @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .    throughout this work",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the study of the periodic orbits for the planar case , @xmath50 .",
    "in forthcoming work , we hope to provide more details on the three dimensional dynamics of this system by considering the information of the planar periodic orbits that is the main objective of this paper .",
    "the previous work performed in @xcite shows that the h4bp possesses four planar equilibrium points given by the expressions @xmath51{\\lambda_{2}}},0\\right ) , l_{2}=\\left(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{\\lambda_{2}}},0\\right ) , l_{3}=\\left(0,\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{\\lambda_{1}}}\\right ) , l_{4}=\\left(0,-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{\\lambda_{1}}}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      the coefficient @xmath54 is negative for @xmath55 $ ] so the equilibrium points @xmath52 and @xmath53 are unstable for this range of values of the mass parameter , in fact , the eigenvalues are given by @xmath56 and @xmath57 with @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "there exists a value @xmath11 such that @xmath60 , as a consequence , the equilibrium points @xmath9 and @xmath10 have the following properties : for @xmath61 their eigenvalues are @xmath62 and @xmath63 , for @xmath14 we have a pair of the eigenvalues @xmath57 of multiplicity 2 , finally when @xmath64 $ ] the eigenvalues are @xmath65 with @xmath66 and @xmath59 .",
    "the value where the change of stability occurs is @xmath67 which is approximately @xmath68 . in @xcite",
    "is reported the value @xmath69 which is slightly lesser than the corrected value reported in this work , however , it is worth mentioning that the conclusions of the above cited work remain true , in particular , for the solar system @xmath70 $ ] as a consequence the equilibrium points @xmath9 and @xmath10 are always linearly stable , therefore , for the four equilibrium points , the liapunov center theorem assures that under non resonant conditions , families of periodic orbits emanate from these equilibrium points . for the equilibrium",
    "points @xmath9 and @xmath10we have two families of such orbits , the so called short and long period families . in order to consider these families of periodic orbits for a further analytic continuation ,",
    "a more detailed discussion on the linear dynamics around these points is required .",
    "we recall that because of the symmetry respect the @xmath71axis , it will enough to study one of these points , say , @xmath9 . +                                                  in the solution ( [ linearsolution ] ) we have two kinds of motion , the so called short and long period solutions .",
    "the short period solution is determined by the choice of constants @xmath102 for @xmath103 and the long period solution is determined by @xmath102 for @xmath104 the initial conditions for the short period solution become @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "if we define @xmath109 and @xmath110 we can write the initial conditions for the short period as @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 . therefore the short period solution looks like      this solution will be completely determined by the constants @xmath114 and @xmath115 , in particular we note that the equation @xmath112 states that the short period motion is retrograde because @xmath116 and @xmath117 are positive",
    ". the above equation can be rewritten in order to figure out its geometry , the new expression looks like        the constants @xmath74 and @xmath54 satisfy @xmath122 , a straightforward computation shows that @xmath123 , so @xmath124 and the major axis of the elliptic motion is on the @xmath125axis .",
    "the eccentricity of the ellipse is given by      so the eccentricity of the ellipses depend only on the mass parameter @xmath2",
    ". a similar study can be performed for the long period motion to obtain that this kind of motion is elliptic with major axis on the @xmath125axis . for the particular value of the sun - jupiter system @xmath127 the value of the periods is @xmath128 and @xmath129 for the short and long period respectively .    in order to perform a numerical continuation from the infinitesimal orbits for each value of @xmath2 we need to consider the values for which there exists resonances between the short and long period motions , i.e. , values of @xmath2 such that        where @xmath137 .",
    "the discriminant @xmath138 , which is involved in the expressions of the frequencies , can be written as @xmath139 with @xmath140 , therefore the equation ( [ omegamu ] ) can be written as @xmath141 .",
    "finally , the equations to be solved for @xmath2 as function of @xmath142 is @xmath143 with @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath148 for @xmath149 therefore @xmath150 , @xmath151 and @xmath152 . by solving two quadratic equations , one of them given by ( [ quad1 ] ) and the second one given by @xmath153 we obtain      in the figures ( [ frequencies ] ) we can observe the behaviour of the frequencies as a functions of the mass parameter , in the table ( [ table : nonlin ] )",
    "we provide some values of the parameter where we have resonances between the frequencies .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in the table we show the values of @xmath2 with 6 decimals , however the formula ( [ resonancesequation ] ) can provide exact results , for instance the true values for @xmath155 are respectively          the structure of the long period family is much more interesting , as we increase the value of @xmath32 the size of the orbits increase as it is shown in the figure [ longphase1 ] , in @xmath157 we have a critical orbits of first type , more precisely a turning point .",
    "after this point the value of @xmath32 increases and the size of the orbits starts to decrease as it is shown in the figure [ longphase1 ] .",
    "it is easy to see that this branch tends to a new bifurcation point at @xmath158 where we obtain a orbit such that the 6 loops coincide . in the figures [ hstabilityshort],[hstabilitylong ] and [ hstabilitylongafterfold ] we can observe the behavior of the horizontal stability of the families of periodic orbits , all of the members of the short period family are horizontally stable until the value @xmath159 where @xmath160 , after that value all of the orbits become horizontally unstable .",
    "the stability of the second branch of the long period shows a remarkable behaviour , in the figure [ hstabilitylongafterfold ] .",
    "we observe that the horizontal stability curve passes through the stable to the unstable zone several times , the values of @xmath32 for which this occurs are @xmath161 , @xmath162 , @xmath163 , the last value corresponds to the turning point of the branch .",
    "after this last point , all of the orbits become horizontally unstable until the value @xmath164 , then we observe crossings between the stable and unstable areas , the values where this occurs are @xmath165 and @xmath166 , this last value corresponds to the bifurcation with the short family .",
    "the vertical stability of both families is shown in the figures [ verticalshort ] and [ verticalong ] , we can observe that all the short family is vertically stable although the coefficient @xmath167 is very near to the critical value @xmath168 , however , we can find a vertical critical value @xmath169 in the long period family , the value of the jacobi constant for such orbit is @xmath170 that is near to the value of @xmath32 for which a turning point occurs , besides this point , all of the family is vertically stable .",
