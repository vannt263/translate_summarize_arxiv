    "ngc 3603 is our local giant h  ii region , and our window into the giant h  ii regions seen in other galaxies .",
    "its high luminosity was first recognized by goss & radhakrishnan ( 1969 ) .",
    "ngc 3603 is located approximately 7 - 8 kpc from the the sun in the carina spiral arm .",
    "eisenhauer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) estimate that the ngc 3603 cluster has a visual luminosity of @xmath4 , about a factor of five lower than that of the r136 cluster in the heart of the giant h  ii region 30 doradus in the lmc .",
    "the half - light radii are comparable , 4 - 5  pc ( eisenhauer et al .",
    "1998 , and references therein ) .",
    "its relative proximity allows us a unique opportunity to study the dense stellar cores that are nt possible in more distant , unresolved regions .",
    "its stellar content also serves as a interesting comparison to what is known in r136 ( e.g. , hunter et al .",
    "1996 ; massey & hunter 1998 ) .    to characterize the massive star population of this high luminosity h  ii region requires both photometry and spectroscopy .",
    "the first photometric study of ngc 3603 was by sher ( 1965 ) , who presented _ ubv _ photometry ( both photoelectric and photographic ) for many of the stars in the periphery of the cluster .",
    "sher s ( 1965 ) survey was followed by van den bergh ( 1978 ) s photoelectric study , and by melnick et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , who used _ ubv _ ccd images to derive photometry for many of the sher ( 1965 ) stars as well as for some stars located closer to to the clusters core .",
    "melnick et al .  ( 1989 ) derived a distance of 7.2  kpc , and an age of 2 - 3  myr but with evidence of considerable age spread .",
    "moffat et al .",
    "( 1994 ) were able to use _ hst _ to obtain f439w ( essentially _ b_-band ) photometry of stars even closer to the core , although the images were obtained with the original wf / pc camera and suffered from the effects of the well - known spherical aberration .",
    "near - ir photometry obtained with adaptive optics is discussed by eisenhauer et al .",
    "deep jhkl photometry extending down to the pre - main - sequence population has been obtained by stolte et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , and deep optical photometry has been discussed by sagar et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and sung & bessell ( 2004 ) .",
    "harayama et al .",
    "( 2007 ) further explore the low - mass imf .",
    "pandey et al .",
    "( 2000 ) used multi - color photometry to explore the reddening within the cluster , finding that it was anomalously high .",
    "because of crowding , photometry has been hard enough , but spectroscopy has been all but impossible , especially in the central core .",
    "hd 97950 , the core of ngc 3603 , has been known to be composite for many years , similar to the situation for r136a in 30 doradus ( see moffat 1983 ) .",
    "it has a collective spectral type of around wn6 + 05 ( walborn 1973 ) .",
    "moffat ( 1983 ) classified 13 objects in the cluster with photographic spectra , finding 11 o - type stars , one early b supergiant , plus the unresolved wr core .",
    "some of these spectra were of blends that were not resolved . with the faint object spectrograph ( fos ) on _ hst _ , drissen et al .",
    "( 1995 ) were able to classify 14 objects , 11 of which were early o - type stars , including five of the earliest class at that time , o3 .",
    "the spectra of four stars have been modeled : crowther & dessart ( 1998 ) have analyzed spectra of the three wolf - rayet stars in the core , and smartt et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have studied the b supergiant sher 25 .    here",
    "matters have stood until the present .",
    "two of the authors ( pm and nim ) proposed unsuccessfully several times to obtain spectra of stars in the crowded core of ngc 3603 with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) on _ hst _ , and after stis s demise it appeared to many of us that the secrets of ngc  3603 would be well - kept for many years to come . however , modern ground - based telescopes now are capable of sub - arcsecond image quality , allowing work from the ground that at one time was only possible from space . here",
    "we utilize the good image quality and large aperture of the baade 6.5-m telescope for spectroscopy of individual stars inwards to the dense central core of ngc 3603 , classifying 26 stars , bringing the total number of stars with classification to 38 .",
    "in addition , we supplement these spectroscopic data with photometry from recently obtained _ hst _ images .",
    "these data permit a better characterization of the massive star population of this nearby giant h  ii region than has hitherto been possible . in ",
    "[ sec - obs ] we will describe the observations and reductions . in   [ sec - types ] we describe our spectral classifications . in ",
    "[ sec - results ] we will use the resulting spectral types and photometry to derive new values for the reddening and distances to the cluster , and construct an h - r diagram . in   [ sec - summary ] we will summarize and discuss our results .",
    "previous studies have found that the reddening across ngc  3603 is large ( @xmath5 ) but quite uniform ( moffat 1983 ) , so that the visually brightest stars are likely to have the highest visual absolute magnitudes .",
    "since the cluster is dominated by early o - type stars , optical photometry can not tell us much about the physical properties of the stars , as the colors are degenerate with effective temperature ( see massey 1998a , 1998b ) , but does allow one to weed out any obvious non - members as was done by melnick et al .",
    "thus we decided to obtain photometry and spectroscopy for as many of the visually brightest members as was practical . to achieve this goal , we identified our sample using _ hst _ images that had been obtained with the high resolution camera ( hrc ) of the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) in connection with a different study of ngc 3603 .",
    "we also use these images for our photometry (   [ sec - phot ] ) .    in table",
    "[ tab : sample ] we list the sample of stars for which we have obtained either spectroscopy or photometry .",
    "we were able to obtain photometry for all of the stars with spectroscopy ( both our own spectroscopy and previous ) , and so table  [ tab : sample ] contains all of the ngc  3603 stars with optical spectroscopy to the present .",
    "of these , 26 were obtained by ourselves in the present study .",
    "we have included a few stars with new photometry for which we lack spectroscopy as yet . the coordinates in table  [ tab : sample ]",
    "have been determined from the acs images and our own ground - based images , where care has been taken to place these on the ucac2 system ( zacharias et al .",
    "we have retained previous nomenclature for stars with previously published spectroscopy or for stars clearly identified in sher ( 1965 ) , but difficulties in identification from the finding charts published by melnick et al .",
    "( 1989 ) and moffat et al .",
    "( 1994 ) have resulted in our presenting new designation for other stars .",
    "all stars in our sample are identified in figs .",
    "[ fig : fc1 ] and [ fig : fc2 ] .",
    "optical spectroscopy was obtained by nim during two nights with the baade 6.5-m magellan telescope on las campanas : 2006 april 12 and 15 .",
    "the data were taken with the inamori magellan areal camera and spectrograph ( imacs ) in its long camera mode ( f/4 ) using the 600 line mm@xmath6 grating .",
    "the wavelength coverage was approximately 3600  to 6700 , with a dispersion of 0.37  pixel@xmath6 , and a spectral resolution of 2.0 .",
    "the detector for imacs consists of a mosaic of 8 ccds . in our case",
    "the spectra fell only along one row of 4 ccds , and the camera was oriented such that the dispersion crossed all four ccds , leaving three narrow ( 20 ) gaps in our coverage : 4330 - 4350  ( which included h@xmath7 ) , 5120 - 5140 , and 5920 - 5940 .",
    "a long 07 slit was used .",
    "the spectrograph was usually rotated so that we would obtain two or more stars of interest on the slit at the same time .",
    "a direct image was usually obtained immediately before the spectroscopic exposure , allowing us to be quite certain of the identification of stars for which we obtained data , including ones that were coincidentally observed by their falling by chance on the slit .",
    "flat field exposures were obtained at the beginning and/or end of each night , and henear comparison arc exposures were taken for each new position .",
    "the spectroscopic exposures typically consisted of three individual exposures in order to facilitate the removal of cosmic rays .",
    "exposure times ranged from 3@xmath3250 s to 3@xmath3600 s.    the seeing was good but not spectacular . using the direct images we obtained adjancent to the spectroscopic exposures , we measured an average full width at half maximum of 09 on the first night , and 08 on the second .",
    "the best images were 067 , and the worst were 11 .",
    "each chip and exposure were reduced separately , and the data were combined at the end to produce a single spectrum for each object along the slit .",
    "the processing steps were the usual ones and were done using iraf .",
    "first , the overscan was used to remove the bias on each chip , and then the the two - dimensional bias structure was subtracted using the average of 10 zero - second exposures .",
    "the flat field exposures were divided into the data , after normalization .",
    "the spectra were extracted using an optimal extraction algorithm , after defining the location of stars of interest and selecting the sky background regions interactively .",
    "the same trace ( spatial position as a function of wavelength ) and extraction apertures were then applied to the comparison arcs , and a wavelength solution was found for each aperture .",
    "the stellar spectra were then normalized to the continua , combined , and the four wavelength regions merged into a single spectrum for each star .    the typical signal to noise ratio ( snr ) is 200 - 500 per 2  spectral resolution element .",
    "such good quality spectra are essential for detecting very weak he  i in the earliest o - type stars .",
    "most of our stars were present in the _ hst _ acs / hrc field of view ( fig  [ fig : fc2 ] ) and this is our primary source for the photometry .",
    "the images we analyzed had been taken through the f435w and f550 m filters , similar to johnson @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( but see below ) .",
    "each image consisted of four dithered exposures ( offset one from another by a fraction of an arcescond ) , combined into a single  drizzled \" image for better sampling of the point - spread function .",
    "the scale of the final image is 0025 pixel@xmath6 .",
    "the total integration time for each image was 8 s. the images were taken on 2005 december 29 .",
    "for the actual photometry we used the phot application of the daophot package of iraf , adopting an aperture radius of 3.0 pixels ( 008 ) .",
    "we then determined the aperture correction from 3.0 pixels to the acs  standard \" aperture of 05 using a few isolated stars on each frame .",
    "we adopted the published aperture correction from 05 to infinity from sirianni et al .",
    "the counts were corrected for the charge transfer efficiency losses , dependent upon the sky background and position on the chip , following the formulation in pavlovsky et al .",
    "we note that the cte correction is quite significant , amounting to @xmath10 to @xmath11  mag , depending upon the brightness and location of a star .",
    "although sirianni et al .  ( 2005 ) recommend working in the acs  native \" photometric system , we have instead chosen to transform to the standard ( johnson ) system .",
    "we wish to determine the color excesses and distance modulus to the cluster , and to do this we rely upon our knowlege of the intrinsic colors and absolute magnitudes of o stars as a function of spectral type ( see , for example , conti 1988 and massey 1998a ) .",
    "these quantities are known _ empirically _ as the result of observational studies in the standard system rather than through models that can simply be recomputed for some alternative bandpass . in other words we know that an o7  v star has @xmath12 of @xmath13 and @xmath14 through observations of young clusters , not as the result of computations .",
    "thus , in order to compute color excesses and derive spectroscopic parallaxes we need to transform _ something _ : either we transform the intrinsic colors and absolute magnitudes to the acs system , or we transform the acs photometry to the standard system . we have chosen the latter , since ( a ) this allows us to include stars outside the acs / hrc field for which standard photometry exists , and ( b ) it allows us to compare our results to others .",
    "that said , we need to emphasize that the transformations introduce uncertainities well beyond the usual photometric errors .",
    "sirianni et al .",
    "( 2005 ) list transformations to _ b _ for f435w acs / hrc photometry , but the transformations are based upon unreddened stars , rather than reddened o stars as is the case here .",
    "furthermore , they offer no transformation for the f550 m filter .",
    "so , we have determined corrections ourselves as follows .",
    "first , we placed the f435w and f550 m photometry on the so - called  vegamag \" system using the revisions to the sirianni et al .",
    "( 2005 ) zeropoints listed on the acs web site .",
    "we then corrected the photometry for the fact that vega actually does nt have zero magnitude , but rather @xmath15 ( bessell et al .  1998 ; see also maz apellniz 2006 ) .",
    "using the kurucz ( 1992 ) atlas 9 models appropriate for o - type stars ( @xmath16 and @xmath1740,000 , 45,000 , and 50,000 k ) we then computed @xmath18 and @xmath19 for various amounts of reddenings , where we have adopted the cardelli et al .",
    "( 1989 ) galactic reddening law .    for an o star with reddening in the range",
    "we expect for ngc 3603 [ i.e. , @xmath20 , we find @xmath21 to @xmath22 .",
    "we adopt @xmath21 .",
    "similarly we find @xmath23 to @xmath24 , and we adopt @xmath25 .",
    "thus @xmath26 , @xmath27 and hence @xmath28 . ] .",
    "jess maz apellniz ( private communication ) derives essentially identical corrections for similarly reddened o stars .",
    "we note that the transformations are sensitive at the 0.02 - 0.03  mag level to the details of the adopted bandpasses . for the acs",
    "bandpasses we synthesized an effective bandpasses using synphot , which includes the wavelength - dependent sensitivities of the entire system ( telescope + filter + instrument ) .",
    "historically , knowledge of the standard johnson bandpasses has required some  reverse engineering \" , tested by using the deduced bandpasses with model atmospheres to reproduce the observed colors of stars ( see buser & kurucz 1978 and bessell et al .",
    "1998 ) . for @xmath8 and",
    "@xmath9 synphot adopts the bandpasses determined by maz apellniz ( 2006 ) , which are similar to , but not quite identical , to the bessell ( 1990 ) versions .",
    "using the bessell ( 1990 ) prescriptions would result in a 0.02  mag shift in both the @xmath29 and @xmath30 transformations used here . similarly ,",
    "if we instead adopted the bandpasses determined by buser & kurucz ( 1978 ) , our conversions would differ by 0.03  mag for @xmath29 and by 0.01 in @xmath30 .",
    "we list the resulting magnitudes and colors in table  [ tab : sample ] as _ v _ and _ b - v_. it is worth comparing our photometry to that of others , as a check on our transformations . for 9 stars in common to melnick et al .",
    "( 1989 ) in our @xmath9-band photometry , we exclude two outliers , and then find a mean difference of + 0.04  mag , in the sense of us minus melnick et al .  ( 1989 ) .",
    "we identify only three stars in common for which we have @xmath31 values ; for these , we find an average difference of @xmath32  mag in the same sense .",

    "( 1995 ) list  @xmath8 \" values they derived from just averaging the flux in their spectra from 4000  to 4750 .",
    "the difference for their 13 stars ( us minus them ) is + 0.05  mag .",
    "we conclude that our photometry is the best that we can do unless and until well - calibrated exposures can be made under good seeing conditions in filter systems which are a closer approximation to the standard system .",
    "some stars fell outside the area covered by the hrc image .",
    "although the same _ hst _ acs program included images taken with the wide field camera of acs , all the stars of interest were quite saturated on these archival images .",
    "so , instead we used a 20 s v - band exposure taken for us by the smarts consortium as part of a separate investigation looking for eclipsing binaries in ngc 3603 .",
    "we used three stars in common to set the photometric zero - point consistently with the acs / hrc system .",
    "the image was taken on 2006 april 3 , and the seeing was 14 , and is used for the finding chart in fig .",
    "[ fig : fc1 ] . as we lacked a _ b_-band exposure , we adopt the @xmath31 values of melnick et al .",
    "( 1989 ) for those stars , when available .",
    "the agreement between the smarts data and melnick et al .",
    "( 1989 ) is good , with an average difference of + 0.03  mag , again in the sense of our values minus theirs .",
    "the photometry of the star sher 58 clearly differs significantly ( @xmath33 mag ) .",
    "their color of this star leads them to conclude it is not a member , but their value is inconsistent with the o8  v spectral type we find , leading us to suspect that we have identified different stars as sher 58 .",
    "the star has a close companion , as is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fc1 ] .",
    "the spectra were classified two ways .",
    "first , a qualitative assessment was made by comparing the observed spectra to those illustrated by walborn & fitzpatrick  ( 1990 ) .",
    "second , a more precise determination was then made quantitatively by measuring the equivalent widths ( ews ) of he  i @xmath34 and he  ii @xmath35 and computing @xmath36(ew",
    "he  i / ew he  ii )",
    ". the latter has been calibrated against spectral class by conti ( see conti & alschuler 1971 , conti 1973 , conti & frost 1977 ; see summary in conti 1988 ) , and indeed forms the astrophysical basis for the spectral classification of o - type stars .",
    "our experience has shown that the visual method works best on spectra with a low or modest snr , while the latter is more accurate for data with a high snr and adequate spectral resolution . in either scheme",
    "the primary diagnostic for the spectral subtypes for o stars is the relative strength of he  i and he  ii , while the primary luminosity indicators are the strength ( emission or absorption ) of the he  ii @xmath37 line and the presence and strength of the n  iii @xmath38 emission lines . for the earliest o types ( o2-o3.5 ) we also considered the criteria suggested by walborn et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , namely the relative strengths of n  iii and n  iv emission , although it has yet to be shown whether or not this defines an extension of the temperature sequence ( see discussion in massey et al .",
    "we include the new spectral types in table  [ tab : sample ] , and illustrate our spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec1]-[fig : spec4 ] .    in a few cases it was clear that our spectral extraction apertures contained some light from neighboring objects .",
    "if the contamination was judged severe , we did not include the star in our study .",
    "however , there were a few cases where there was some minor blending , and we note such cases .",
    "for these , the spectral types may not be as good as for the other stars in our sample .",
    "we were able to classify 26 stars in the cluster , 16 of which were previously unclassified . among these",
    "are a number of newly classified o3 and o4 types .",
    "we compare our new spectral types to those in the literature in table  [ tab : spec ] .",
    "in general we find very good agreement , usually within a single type and luminosity class .",
    "our experience has shown that nebular contamination can substantially alter the classification , particularly for the early o stars where he  i @xmath39 is not visible , and one must rely solely on he  i @xmath34 , which may be filled in by nebular emission . in choosing which stars to observe",
    "we generally decided not to observe the stars that had been previously observed with _",
    "hst s _ fos by drissen et al .",
    "( 1995 ) . although the drissen et al .",
    "( 1995 ) sample were observed without the benefits of sky subtraction , the fos observations were obtained with such a small aperture ( 025 ) that nebular contamination should not be an issue .",
    "however , we did decide to include a number of stars that had been previously observed by moffat ( 1983 ) , as these were observed photographically .",
    "given this , we find the agreement remarkably good , a testament to the careful work of the previous studies .",

    "his sample showed a dispersion of only 0.09  mag .",
    "we find an even smaller dispersion , 0.06  mag .",
    "we are thus reassured that the reddening is well determined to the o stars in ngc  3603 , and agree with the conclusion of moffat ( 1983 ) that there is very little variation in reddening across this cluster .",
    "we adopt an average value of @xmath0 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the b1 supergiant , sher 25 , has a color excess that is considerably larger than average .",

    "2002 ) , and is known to show circumstellar material ( brandner et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "next , let us derive a distance modulus to the cluster by adopting an absolute magnitude for each star based upon the spectral type and luminosity class .",
    "we adopt the values of conti et al .",
    "( 1983 ) for the o stars , interpolating as needed ; for the b supergiant ( sher 25 ) we adopt @xmath83 from humphreys & mcelroy ( 1984 ) .",
    "if we make _ no _ correction for the reddening to the cluster , we derive an _",
    "apparent _ distance modulus of @xmath84 ( s.d.m . ) .",
    "the standard deviation of this sample is 0.5  mag , which is what we expect , given that that is also the typical scatter in @xmath85 for a given spectral type and luminosity class ( conti 1988 ) .",
    "the median is 19.00 .",
    "if we exclude the giants and supergiants ( as their absolute magnitudes might cover a larger range ) , we determine similar values : the average is @xmath86 ( s.d.m . ) , with a standard deviation of the sample of 0.6  mag .",
    "the median is 19.07 .",
    "we therefore adopt an _ apparent _ distance modulus to the cluster of @xmath87 .",
    "if the extinction were normal ( @xmath88 ) this would then correspond to a true distance modulus of 14.8 , or 9.1  kpc .",
    "however , pandey et al .  ( 2000 ) have investigated the reddening towards this cluster , and conclude that the reddening is anomalously high within , with a ratio of total to selective extinction @xmath89 , a value that is more typical of dense environments ( see , for example , whittet 2003 ) .",
    "they correct for reddening assuming an @xmath90 for foreground ( with @xmath88 ) , and @xmath89 for the color excess above this value ; i.e. , @xmath91 $ ] .",
    "if we were to make this correction , then the true distance modulus we would obtain would be 14.4 , or 7.6  kpc .",
    "the physical distance to ngc 3603 is poorly determined .",
    "there are three methods that have been employed : main - sequence fitting , spectroscopic parallaxes , and kinematic distance determinations based upon rotation models of the milky way .",
    "we summarize the results in tables  [ tab : distances ] and [ tab : kinematic ] .",
    "main - sequence fitting ( melnick et al .  1989 , pandey et al .",
    "2000 ) , sung & bessell 2004 ) is probably the least certain of these for such a young cluster , given that the theoretical zero - age main - sequence is nearly vertical in the color - magnitude diagram .",
    "this is particularly true in the @xmath92 plane used by sung & bessell ( 2004 ) ; see their fig .",
    "this problem was recognized by van den bergh ( 1978 ) , who obtained _ ubv _ photometry of cluster members , but noted that such data was not sufficient to determine a reliable distance .",
    "( he did , however , determine a kinematic distance , as discussed below . )",
    "see also the discussion in sagar et al .",
    "the spectroscopic parallaxes ( moffat 1983 , crowther & dessart 1998 , sagar et al .",
    "2001 ) should be more reliable .",
    "our sample of stars is considerably larger than those previously employed .",
    "of course , a key issue in deriving the physical distance is how reddening is treated . in table  [ tab : distances ] we include the _ apparent _ distance moduli as well as the derived physical distances .",
    "we can see that most modern studies derive a similar value for the apparent distance modulus ( i.e. , 18.6 - 19.1 ) , despite the extremely large range in physical distances derived ( 6.3  kpc to 10.1  kpc ) .",
    "we can compare our distance to the kinematic distances ( table  [ tab : kinematic ] ) .",
    "goss & radhakrishnan ( 1969 ) find a distance of 8.4  kpc , but that was based upon the old assumption that the distance from the galactic center to the sun is 10  kpc .",
    "correcting to the more modern value @xmath93  kpc would result in a 7.1  kpc distance .",
    "van den bergh ( 1978 ) also derives a similar kinematic distance , 6.8  kpc , when corrected to @xmath93  kpc .",
    "de pree et al .",
    "( 1999 ) quote a value of @xmath94  kpc , but one of the co - authors , miller goss ( private communication ) , writes that this value should be revised to 7.0  kpc .",
    "russeil ( 2003 ) finds a slightly larger kinematic distance , 7.9  kpc . while these span a range",
    ", we can conclude that our apparent distance modulus can be reconciled with the kinematic distance moduli in the literature only if the extinction is anomalous within the cluster , as pandey et al .",
    "( 2000 ) argue for sher 25 based on the argument that applying it leads to too high a luminosity for this star , and instead adopt @xmath95 on somewhat arbitrary grounds . however , they had ( mis)applied @xmath89 to the entire line of sight reddening ( @xmath96 ) , rather than applying @xmath88 to the foreground reddening ( @xmath90 ) and @xmath89 to the remainder ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "thus , using the pandey et al .",
    "( 2000 ) reddening leads to @xmath98  mag , not 6.88  mag , and actually smaller than the value smartt et al .",
    "( 2002 ) adopt ( @xmath991.60=5.92  mag ) . ] .",
    "for constructing the h - r diagram we have chosen to adopt our _ apparent _ distance modulus , and then correct individual stars for differences in the average reddening by @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the difference between the average color excess 1.39 and that for an individual star . since the variation in the reddening is small , using 3.1 instead would lead to at most a difference of 0.25  mag in the final value .",
    "we include the absolute visual magnitudes obtained by this method in table  [ tab : results ] . in most cases",
    "the agreement between the @xmath85 ( based on the spectral type and luminosity class ) and that computed from the average apparent distance modulus ( corrected for reddening above or below the cluster average ) is good , within the 0.5  mag scatter we expect ( conti 1988 ) .",
    "finally , let us use the recent effective temperature scale of massey et al .",
    "( 2005 ) to place these stars on the h - r diagram .",
    "the new scale includes the effects of line- and wind - blanketing , which significantly lowers the effective temperatures for galactic stars .",

    "it is worth remembering that in the r136 cluster there were several h - rich wn6 stars which had absorption lines ; massey & hunter ( 1998 ) concluded that these were not evolved objects , but rather  of stars on steroids \" , i.e. , stars whose masses were so high , and which were so luminous , that their winds were so strong that their spectra simply _ resembled _ wr stars in having strong emission lines .",
    "the modeling of crowther & dessart ( 1998 ) bear this out : the wrs are coeval with the rest of the cluster , and are simply slightly more luminous and massive .",
    "( note that for simplicity we have truncated the evolutionary tracks prior to the wolf - rayet stage . ) the most massive non - wr stars in r136 are more massive than we see here , but as discussed below , that could be a metallicity effect . in any event , the unevolved stellar population of ngc  3603 is certainly quite massive .    secondly , the ages of the highest mass stars are roughly 1 - 2  myr , with very little dispersion .",
    "sung & bessell ( 2004 ) obtained a similar result .",

    "this is similar to the age found for stars in the outer regions of the cluster by sung & bessell ( 2004 ) .",
    "it is premature to attempt to derive an initial mass function for the high mass stars of ngc 3603 , as photometry alone can not provide a sufficiently accurate discriminant of bolometric luminosity ( and hence mass ) at such high effective temperatures .",

    "in addition , we provide identification and acs / hrc photometry of another 12 stars in the central core for which spectroscopy would be desirable .",
    "our spectroscopic sample includes many stars of type o3 .",
    "we find an average reddening @xmath0 , with very little scatter ( sample standard deviation of 0.05  mag ) , indicative of very little variation in reddening in the core .",
    "our spectroscopic parallax for the cluster can be reconciled with the kinematic distance of the cluster if we adopt the reddening proposed by pandey et al .  ( 2000 ) ; we then derive a distance of 7.6  kpc .",
    "we emphasize that although there has been a very large range of physical distances derived for this cluster in the past 10 years ( 6.3 - 10.1  kpc ) , there is excellent agreement in the _ apparent _ distance modulus of the cluster ( 18.6 - 19.1  mag ) .",
    "the disagreement in the distances are really based upon exactly how to correct for reddening .",
    "we side step the issue by using the apparent distance modulus ( plus a modest correction for differential reddening ) to construct the h - r diagram .",
    "it reveals a mostly coeval population of massive stars extending beyond 120@xmath1 , with ages of 1 - 2  myr .",
    "the most massive and luminous stars are the h - rich wn stars , as expected by analogy with r136 ( massey & hunter 1998 ) . some stars of 20 - 40@xmath1 may show a larger age spread , up to 4  myr , with the oc9.7 and b - type supergiants having an age of 4  myr .",
    "additional spectroscopy of stars is underway by a. f. j. moffat ( private communication ) , which will further help refine our view of this interesting cluster . while further _",
    "stis spectroscopy of the most crowded members would be highly desirable , it is worth noting how much can now be accomplished from the ground using the best modern telescopes .",
    "more such work is needed for deriving an initial mass function for the massive stars in this cluster , as less than a third of the stars with masses above 20@xmath1 have spectroscopy .",
    "we hope to help improve this situation in the coming observing season ourselves .",
    "we are grateful to david osip for allowing us to observe during some magellan engineering time shortly in advance of our scheduled night .",
    "jess maz apellniz was kind enough to allow us access to one of the acs / hrc frames prior to it becoming public in order to prepare for the observing run ; we also gratefully acknowledge his calling our attention to an error we made in the photometric transformations in an earlier version of the manuscript .",
    "jennifer mack provided guidance in our use of synphot .",
    "we also benefited from correspondence with geoff clayton , miller goss , tony moffat , brian skiff , and nolan walborn , as well as from comments on an early draft by deidre hunter .",

    "<S> we investigate the massive star content of ngc  3603 , the closest known giant h  ii region . </S>",

    "<S> 16 had no previous spectroscopy . </S>",

    "<S> the total number of stars that have been spectroscopically classified in ngc 3603 now stands at 38 . </S>",
    "<S> the sample is dominated by very early o type stars ( o3 ) ; there are also several ( previously identified ) h - rich wn+abs stars . </S>",
    "<S> we derive @xmath0 , and find that there is very little variation in reddening across the cluster core , in agreement with previous studies . </S>",
    "<S> our spectroscopic parallax is consistent with the kinematic distance only if the ratio of total to selective extinction is anomalously high within the cluster , as argued by pandey et al . adopting their reddening </S>",
    "<S> , we derive a distance of 7.6  kpc . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the various distance estimates to the cluster , and note that although there has been a wide range of values in the recent literature ( 6.3 - 10.1  kpc ) there is actually good agreement with the apparent distance modulus of the cluster  the disagreement has been the result of the uncertain reddening correction . </S>",
    "<S> we construct our h - r diagram using the apparent distance modulus with a correction for the slight difference in differential reddening from star to star . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting h - r diagram reveals that the most massive stars are highly coeval , with an age of 1 - 2  myr , and of very high masses ( 120 @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the three stars with wolf - rayet features are the most luminous and massive , and are coeval with the non - wrs , in accord with what was found in the r136 cluster </S>",
    "<S> . there may be a larger age spread ( 1 - 4  myr ) for the lower mass objects ( 20 - 40@xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> two supergiants ( an oc9.7 i and the b1 i star sher 25 ) both have an age of about 4  myr . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the stellar content of this cluster to that of r136 , finding that the number of very high luminosity ( @xmath2 ) stars is only about 1.1 - 2.4@xmath3 smaller in ngc 3603 . </S>",
    "<S> the most luminous members in both clusters are h - rich wn+abs stars , basically  of stars on steroids \" , relatively unevolved stars whose high luminosities results in high mass loss rates , and hence spectra that mimic that of evolved wns . to derive an initial mass function for the massive stars in ngc 3603 </S>",
    "<S> requires considerably more spectroscopy ; we estimate from a color - magnitude diagram that less than a third of the stars with masses above 20@xmath1 have spectral types known . </S>"
