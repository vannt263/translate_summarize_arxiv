    "hr  7355 ( hd  182180 ) is a bright b2vn helium - strong star originally classified as a be star due to h@xmath1 emission present in its spectrum ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "previous studies of this star show a @xmath2 300 km s@xmath3 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* abt et al . 2002 ) ) with a p@xmath4 0.52 d ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "hr  7355 is the most rapidly rotating helium - strong star , rotating near its critical velocity , providing an excellent testbed for magnetospheres under the effects of rapid rotation .",
    "least - squares deconvolution ( lsd ) describes the stellar spectrum as the convolution of a mean stokes i or v profile , representative of the average shape of the line profile , and a line mask , describing the position , strength and magnetic sensitivity of all lines in the spectrum . from the lsd",

    "i@xmath8 is the continuum value of the intensity profile .",
    "the integral is evaluated over the full velocity range of the mean profile .",
    "we detect a strong magnetic field on hr  7355 , the most rapidly rotating helium - strong star discovered thus far .",
    "a simultaneous independent confirmation of the field detection has been obtained with fors at the vlt by rivinius et al .",
    "the longitudinal magnetic field varies sinusoidally with the rotation period , with extrema -2 to 2.5 kg . assuming a dipole magnetic field , the polar value of the magnetic field is @xmath9 13 - 17 kg .",
    "the photometric ( brightness ) light curve constructed from hipparcos archival data and new ctio measurements shows two minima separated by 0.5 in rotational phase and occurring 0.25 cycles before / after the magnetic extrema . using the scargle periodogram , eclipse - like photometric variations give a highly precise p@xmath10 = 0.5214404(6 ) days .",
    "we confirm spectral variability of helium and metal lines , as well as variability of h@xmath1 emission .",
    "h@xmath1 emission indicates circumstellar material extending out to 5 r@xmath11 from the star , rotating rigidly with the stellar surface .",
    "we conclude that hr 7355 is a magnetic oblique rotator with a magnetosphere , mirroring the physical picture for @xmath0 ori e ( ( * ? ? ?",
