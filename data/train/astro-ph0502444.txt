    "clusters of galaxies are the largest - scale objects in the universe in which dynamical relaxation has fairly advanced .",
    "they consist of 1001000 galaxies , x - ray emitting hot plasma , and dark matter , which binds the systems .",
    "since the dynamical time scale of clusters is comparable to the hubble time , these systems are still presently dynamically evolving , and thus are supposed to somehow keep memory of the cosmological initial conditions .",
    "for this reason , clusters of galaxies are often used as cosmological probes at various wavelengths ( e.g. , kitayama et al .",
    "1998 ) . now that the cosmological parameters have been determined with a reasonable accuracy by microwave background radiation and distant supernovae ( spergel et al .  2003 ) , our primary motivation is now directed to understanding the major constituents of the universe , such as galaxies , baryonic gas , and dark matter , which are playing major roles in clusters of galaxies .    according to the cold dark - matter scenario , small - scale objects collapsed first as a result of gravitational instability , and then they pulled together and merged one another to form bigger and bigger systems ( dark - matter halos ) with time . in each dark - matter",
    "halo the gas condensed and formed stars  the birth of shining galaxies .",
    "during the course of assembly to the larger systems ( groups / clusters ) , galaxies experienced environmental effects by interactions with other galaxies , cluster potential , and/or intra - cluster gas . hence , their star - formation activities as well as morphologies are largely affected and truncated ( e.g. , larson et al .",
    "1980 ; lavery , henry 1986 ; moore et al .",
    "1996 ; abadi et al .",
    "1999 ; hashimoto , oemler 2000 ) . in this way",
    ", galaxy evolution must be closely related to the structure evolution of the universe and the change of galaxy environment .",
    "these environmental effects ( a posteriori ) are very important because the well - known morphology  density relation ( dressler 1980 ; dressler et al .",
    "1997 ) and the origin of the hubble sequence of galaxies are possibly related to these processes .",
    "these are additional effects on top of the intrinsic effects ( a priori ) set by the cosmological initial conditions , i.e. , cluster cores started off from higher density peaks in the early universe , where galaxies formed quickly in a biased manner .",
    "( e.g. , kaiser 1984 ; bardeen et al .",
    "1986 ; cen , ostriker 1993 ) .    in spite of recent vigorous progress in this field ,",
    "the central physical processes behind the environmental effects still remain elusive .",
    "the key possible processes that have been proposed include : ( 1 ) ram - pressure stripping , a sudden removal of gas by the interactions with the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) ( e.g. , abadi et al .",
    "1999 ) ; ( 2 ) tidal encounters , often accompanied by an intense star burst ( e.g. , lavery , henry 1986 ; hashimoto , oemler 2000 ) ; and ( 3 ) strangulation , a gradual consumption of the remaining disk gas without any further gas supply from the halo ( larson et al .  1980 ) .",
    "being limited by the light - collection power of telescopes and/or narrow field coverage of detectors , observers have concentrated on either cluster cores or general fields , and have had little knowledge concering the transition regions that bridge these two extreme environments .",
    "we do not know the matter distribution ( galaxy / dark - matter ) there , either .",
    "the advent of the subaru telescope ( iye et al .",
    "2004 ) with a unique combination of great light - collection power and large field of view , has opened a new window in the study of distant clusters .",
    "this has enabled us to look into a more distant universe ( @xmath9 ) which has abundant information on galaxy / cluster evolution , and to reach fainter objects ( @xmath7@xmath10 + 1.5 ) where evolution is stronger . at the same time , with its wide - field camera suprime - cam ( miyazaki et al .",
    "2002 ) covering @xmath11 ( 14  mpc in physical scale or 29  mpc in comoving scale at @xmath12 ) , we can view from cluster cores through the transition region out to the general field , all at once . taking this unique advantage of subaru",
    ", we started the pisces project ( panoramic imaging and spectroscopy of cluster evolution with subaru ) by combining several active research groups in japan working on clusters of galaxies in various aspects ( optical - nir / x - ray / lensing / simulation ) .",
    "this large collaborative project aims to carry out systematic deep and wide observations of distant clusters at various evolutionary stages , and compare their fundamental physical quantities ( mass , luminosity , colors , spectral indices , morphology , and kinematics ) in detail as a function of the environment ( structure , local density ) and time ( redshift ) .",
    "this process will eventually prove when , where and how the galaxies form and evolve .",
    "the basic idea is to utilize clusters of galaxies as landmarks in the distant universe , and to map out the large - scale structures around them , and reconstruct the history of galaxy evolution along with the hierarchical structure formation of the universe .",
    "the critical issues we aim to address with pisces are the following two :    * * cluster - scale assembly and the spatial bias : * we will map out the large - scale structure beyond the cluster cores ( e.g. , west et al . 1998 ; lubin et al .",
    "2000 ) and trace the history of cluster - scale assembly along the filaments . by using the weak - lensing technique , we will also map the dark - matter distribution .",
    "galaxies do not necessarily trace the distribution of dark matter faithfully ( e.g. , kaiser 1984 ; bardeen et al .",
    "1986 ; cen , ostriker 1993 ) . by quantifying this galaxy formation bias as a function of the redshift , scale and density",
    ", we will place strong constraints on the galaxy formation model .",
    "* * star formation history and the environmental effect : * by comparing the galaxy properties as a function of environment and time with the aid of a population synthesis technique , we will derive the ` environment - dependent ' star - formation rate , mass , and morphology of galaxies . by watching when , where , and how the environmental effects exert on galaxies , we will identify the major physical processes involved in morphological transformation , and reveal the origin of the hubble sequence of galaxies .",
    "the total planned targets of our pisces project are 15 x - ray detected clusters at 0.4@xmath13@xmath14@xmath131.3 , covering various evolutionary stages ( @xmath14 ) and richness ( @xmath15 ) , in coordination with xmm / chandra and hst / acs observations ( see table  [ tab : targets ] ) .",
    "the criteria of our target selection are the following :    * x - ray detection : we select clusters that are detected in x - rays .",
    "x - ray selection is less prone to the projection effect along the line of sight than optical selection . although we may be biased towards the densest regions at all epochs , this is not very problematic in a time - sequence comparison , since the wide - field imaging will cover all environments from the densest cluster cores to the nearby groups and to the low - density filaments connecting the clumps . * redshift range : we limit the cluster sample to the redshift range of @xmath4 , so that the suprime - cam filters alone in the optical ( @xmath16 ) can neatly cover the 4000   break feature in the rest - frame , and hence the photometric redshift technique works well ( subsection 2.2 ) . * redundancy : we select multiple ( 35 ) clusters in each of the four redshift ranges ( @xmath17 , 0.55 , 0.85 , and 1.2 )",
    ". clusters of galaxies are statistical objects by nature , and are likely to have large varieties ; it is thus important to average the properties over many clusters of different richness at a given epoch to obtain general views . *",
    "coordination with other projects : we include many common targets with other major cluster projects , especially with xmm / chandra and hst / acs observations ( e.g. , blakeslee 2001 , private communication ) .",
    "such coordination is important , since diffuse x - ray emission traces the distribution of gravitationally bound systems and provides the properties of hot intra - cluster media , such as temperature and chemical composition .",
    "hst / acs gives us deep images of high spatial resolution , and hence provides essential morphological information of galaxies .",
    "our sample also includes a cluster at the nep region where the visibility of astro - f ( japanese space nir  fir mission , providing 10@xmath0@xmath110@xmath0 field - of - view ; shibai 2003 ; murakami 2005 ) is good ; we plan for a follow - up observation to search for dusty star - burst phenomena and to improve our photometric redshifts .",
    "also note that all of our clusters above @xmath18 are targets for space - ir imaging by the spitzer telescope .",
    "we also include seven clusters that have existing detailed sunyaev ",
    "zeldovich effect ( s  z ) maps for comparing of the sub - structures in the cluster cores .",
    "* visibility : the maximum elevation must be @xmath19 ( airmass @xmath13 1.6 ) from the subaru telescope at mauna kea in hawaii for efficient observations .    note that our total sample includes some gto ( guaranteed time observations ) targets of the suprime - cam team ( cl  1604 and rx  j0849 ) and those targeted by different teams , including some of our members ( cl  0024 , cl  0939 , ms  0451 , and ms1054 ) .",
    "these are appended to the pisces targets , since the imaging data of these distant clusters are taken under similar scientific motivations , and the data are useful if viewed under the same context and in a systematic way .",

    "seeing sizes are measured from the combined frames .    [ tab : observation ]    imaging data of cl  0016 and rx  j0153 were obtained with suprime - cam ( 0.@xmath21202 per pixel , and 34  @xmath1 27field of view ) mounted on the subaru telescope at mauna kea during the nights of 2003 september 2526 .",
    "images were obtained through several broad - band filters ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively ) .",
    "the net exposure times and the 5-@xmath24 limiting magnitudes are summarized in table  [ tab : observation ] .",
    "the seeing was extremely stable during these nights and across the bands , and its sizes were always between 0.@xmath215 and 0.@xmath2165 ( fwhm ) .",
    "therefore , our combined frames achieved the uniform seeing size of 0.@xmath2165 in all passbands for both clusters .",
    "the sky conditions were photometric , and the photometric zero - points were calibrated based on the landolt ( 1992 ) standard stars in @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27-bands , and @xmath28 and @xmath29-band images were calibrated directly onto the sdss system ( fukugita et al .",
    "1995 ) based on the spectro - photmetric standard stars . after correcting for the galactic extinction ( schlegel et al .",
    "1998 ) , we checked the accuracy of our photometric zero - points .",
    "we compared the colors of galactic stars in our field with those of gunn and stryker ( 1983 ) stars ( stellar seds convolved with suprime - cam responses ) .",
    "it turned out that our colors are slightly shifted with respect to the gs stars ( @xmath30 magnitude at most ) .",
    "although we do not know the exact reason for this discrepancy , it may be partly because the filter response functions , including ccd sensitivity curves , are slightly different between sdss and our observations with suprime - cam .",
    "we shifted the zero - points of the photometric catalogues so as to match with the gs star colors in the same manner as in ajiki et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "the data were reduced with the iraf and nekosoft ( yagi et al .",
    "2002 ) software packages , following standard procedures of bias subtraction and flat - fielding .",
    "the latter was achieved using supersky ( self ) flats constructed from the median of the dithered science frames ( objects are masked ) .",
    "we then combined the mosaiced chips , carefully matching the relative flux among them .",
    "note that , since the seeing was very stable during the nights , we performed no point - spread function ( psf ) equalization in order to avoid image degradation .",
    "color pictures of the central regions ( 3@xmath1 3 ) of the two clusters are shown in figures  [ fig : cl0016_image ] and [ fig : rxj0153_image ] .",
    "galaxies are detected in the @xmath31 and @xmath32-band images for cl  0016 and rx  j0153 , respectively , using the sextractor software ( bertin and arnouts 1996 ) .",
    "we detected all objects with at least 8 connected pixels ( 0.33 arcsec@xmath2 , equivalent to the area of the psf ) more than 2 @xmath24 above the median sky .",
    "the images in all filters were aligned by centroiding stars throughout the field and fitting a stretch and shift .",
    "we used a fixed 2  diameter aperture ( corresponding to 1315  kpc at the cluster redshifts ) when measuring the galaxy colors .",
    "the magnitude mag_auto was used as a measure of the total magnitude .      in order to map the structures of clusters out to low - density regions around the cluster cores ,",
    "the key requirement is the removal of unassociated galaxies in the foreground and background that dominate at the outskirts of clusters .",
    "this is important to maximize the contrast of the member galaxies on the projected sky .",
    "spectroscopy is , of course , the ideal method to remove field contamination from our sample .",
    "it is not practical , however , to obtain spectroscopy for @xmath33 10000 very faint galaxies required for our analysis .",
    "we therefore exploit the photometric redshift ( phot-@xmath14 ) technique , as an observationally efficient and reliable method to largely remove contamination ( @xmath34 90% over the whole suprime - cam field ) .",
    "we applied the photometric redshift code developed by kodama , bell , and bower ( 1999 ) to the galaxies in our full photometric catalog in @xmath35 ( cl  0939 ) , @xmath16 ( cl  0016 ) , and @xmath36 ( rx  j0153 ) , respectively .",
    "we note that these combinations of passbands neatly cover the 4000   break features at the rest - frame of each cluster , which is essential to obtain accurate photometric redshifts , especially for red cluster members ( kodama et al .",
    "1999 ) ; typical uncertainties of only @xmath37 0.050.1 are expected .",
    "the photometric redshift technique is now widely used to trace large - scale structures in the distant universe ( e.g. , connolly et al .",
    "1996 ; kodama et al .",
    "2001 ; gray et al . 2003 ; nakata et al . 2005 ) .",
    "in order to apply the photometric redshift technique , the colors of the model galaxies ( templates ) and those of the observed galaxies must match perfectly well . in reality , a zero - point mismatch between the observed data and the model spectra often exists .",
    "first of all , an absolute flux calibration in the observed data is difficult with only a small number of photometric standards observed during the nights ( 12 per band ) .",
    "secondly , the synthesized model spectra inevitably have uncertainties on the order of 0.050.2 magnitudes ( charlot et al .",
    "1996 ) . taking these uncertainties into account , we shift our model magnitudes by 0.000.15 magnitudes so that the models can reasonably reproduce the observed colors of the red color  magnitude sequences in the cluster cores , because the red - sequence colors of clusters are known to be good guides of passive evolution ( e.g. , kodama et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the definition of our photometric members ( phot-@xmath14 members ) for cl  0939 is @xmath38 or @xmath39 , as used in kodama et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . however , for the other two clusters ( cl  0016 and rx  j0153 ) , we narrowed the redshift ranges to @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively , or @xmath42 , to further suppress any remaining contamination and to achieve higher contrasts on true structures in the lower density regions located at the cluster redshifts .",
    "the depths of the phot-@xmath14 sliced regions are 553 , 254 , and 215 mpc in the comoving scale for cl  0939 , cl  0016 , and rx  j0153 , respectively .",
    "it should be noted that these stringent criteria for photometric members tend to lose some true cluster members due to the error in photometric redshifts , which can be larger than @xmath43 especially for blue members .",
    "when we analyze the galaxy properties in a future paper ( tanaka et al .",
    "2005 ) , we will adopt much broader ranges for photometric members to achieve higher completeness at the cost of higher contamination ( the remaining contamination will , however , be subtracted statistically as in kodama et al .",
    "2001 ) . in the current work",
    ", we did not subtract the remaining contamination , since we concentrated on the structures of the galaxy distribution , and did not primarily consider the photometric properties of the member galaxies .",
    "a comparison of our photometric redshifts and the spectroscopic redshifts available from the literature are briefly discussed in kodama et al .",
    "( 2001 ) for cl  0939 , and will be reported in tanaka et al .",
    "( 2005 ) for cl  0016 and rx  j0153 . in short",
    ", we found that about 7080% of the spectroscopic members could be assigned reasonable photometric redshifts , and were hence identified as our photometric members .",
    "we also note that a spectroscopic follow - up of the cl  0016 and rx  j0153 clusters with focas on subaru was performed in 2004 october and the data are being processed , which will confirm membership for the bright objects .",
    "we first show color  magnitude diagrams in figure  [ fig : cmr ] to demonstrate the data that we have obtained in all available passbands .",
    "we then use these diagrams to separate the red and blue cluster members .",
    "the 2-d distributions of these photometric members are shown on two scales , close - up of the central regions of the clusters ( figure  [ fig : map_center ] ) to trace the sub - structures in or near the cluster cores and the whole suprime - cam field ( @xmath3430  across ; figure  [ fig : map_lss ] ) to map out the large - scale structures surrounding the cores .",
    "the optical sub - structures of the clusters are compared to the x - ray maps and show similarities ( figure  [ fig : map_center ] ) .",
    "we will then try to quantify the structures of the clusters using the shapes of the 2-d iso - density contours ( figure  [ fig : contour_shape ] ) and a fourier expansion of the galaxy distribution in the tangential direction around the cluster cores ( figure  [ fig : fourier ] ) to discuss the roundness and filamentarity of the structures .",
    "finally , these observed structures will be compared to the model predictions from our numerical simulation ( @xmath44gc ; nagashima et al .",
    "2005 ) which combines the @xmath8-body calculation concerning the development of the dark matter halos and what is commonly known as semi - analytic modelling of galaxy formation and evolution ( star formation and mergers ) within the halos ( figures  [ fig : map_lss ] and [ fig : contour_shape ] ) .",
    "color  magnitude diagrams of the galaxies within 1  mpc radii from the centers of the three clusters are shown in figure  [ fig : cmr ] .",
    "the photometric members selected based on the photometric redshifts are indicated by circles , while the photometric non - members are indicated by crosses . as expected , the photometric members show a tight color ",
    "magnitude relations in all colors that are composed of old passively evolving galaxies ( e.g. , bower et al .  1992 ; ellis et al .",

    "the ` red ' galaxies and ` blue ' galaxies are separated by the dashed line on the color  magnitude diagram which shows the color bracketing the rest - frame 4000 break .",
    "the distance of the separative line from the red color  magnitude sequence corresponds to @xmath51(@xmath25@xmath52@xmath26)=@xmath520.2 in the rest - frame following the original butcher and oemler s ( 1984 ) type definition .",
    "this is transformed to each observed frame using kodama et al.s ( 1998 ) population synthesis model by taking into account the color evolution ( kodama , bower 2001 ) .",
    "the thus - defined red and blue galaxies are shown by different symbols in figures  [ fig : map_center ] and [ fig : map_lss ] .",

    "* * rx  j0153 : * this cluster has a core of very complicated shape , and multiple filaments have been identified coming out from the core , which may be connected to the small clumps scattered around the core . the se clump at ( @xmath51r.a . , @xmath51dec",
    "= ( 4@xmath0,@xmath529@xmath0 ) was detected in an xmm image , but it is likely to be a foreground structure at slightly lower redshift , since the location of the red color sequence is slightly offset to bluer color [ by @xmath61=0.1  mag ] in this system compared to that of the main cluster .",
    "in fact , this clump disappears in the middle panel of figure  [ fig : map_lss ] where only red - sequence galaxies consistent with the cluster redshift are plotted . in any case",
    ", this rather complicated structure in and around the core ( figures  [ fig : map_center ] and [ fig : map_lss ] ) suggests that it is still in a dynamically young stage of cluster - scale assembly at this high redshift .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with the build - up of clusters in the cdm simulations ( e.g. , ghigna et al .  1998 ;",
    "yahagi et al .",
    "2004 ) .      to trace the evolution of cluster structures with time , and to compare it with numerical simulations",
    ", we tried to quantify the structures of the phot-@xmath14 member distribution by defining the following two quantities : ( 1 ) roundness of the iso - density contour as a function of the threshold of the contour ; ( 2 ) filamentarity of galaxy distribution in the tangential direction .",
    "we intuitively expect that at high redshifts , clusters are in the process of vigorous assembly by capturing the surrounding systems along the filaments , and thus having more and more clumpy and filamentary structures in and around the cluster cores and large deviation from a spherical distribution .",
    "0.5 cm ( 80mm,80mm)figure6b.ps    ( 80mm,80mm)figure7.ps    the roundness index of an iso - density contour is defined by @xmath62 in analogy to schmalzing et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , where @xmath63 is the length of the contour , and @xmath64 is the area surrounded by the contour .",
    "this index represents the roundness of the contour and a perfect circle gives unity .",
    "a square and an equilateral triangle give shape indices of 1.27 and 1.65 , respectively .",
    "david s star , where an equilateral triangle is placed up - side down on top of another triangle , gives @xmath65 .",
    "the larger is the index , the larger is the deviation from a circle .",
    "the @xmath66 indices are measured for each iso - density contour of the phot-@xmath14 members drawn on the major clump at or near the cluster center ( figure  [ fig : map_lss ] ) .",
    "we plot them as a function of the threshold of the contour ( @xmath24 ) in the left panel of figure  [ fig : contour_shape ] for the three clusters at different redshifts .",
    "the general trend seen in all clusters is that the inner ( higher ) contours are closer to circles , but the outer ( lower ) contours show larger deviations from circles , indicating more complicated structures that reflect the filaments coming out from the main bodies , as is evident from the 2-d distribution in figures  [ fig : map_center ] and [ fig : map_lss ] .",
    "the observed clusters after the photometric selection still contain non - negligible field contamination at the lower contours , and it can skew the intrinsic shape of cluster galaxy distribution . to estimate this effect ,",
    "we generated a perfectly round cluster and added field contamination randomly over the entire field by a monte - carlo simulation .",
    "we then measured the shape indices , @xmath66 , to see how much the round galaxy distribution was skewd .",
    "however , as shown in figure  [ fig : contour_error ] , such a statistical effect is found to be small . on the other hand ,",
    "if the intrinsic distribution of cluster galaxies are far from round , the uniform ( random ) field contamination would make the contours rounder and the measured @xmath66-indices would be lower limits . in any case , we conclude that the statistical error in measuring the contour shapes is not so large as to affect the trends we see in figure  [ fig : contour_shape ] .",
    "cl  0939 and cl  0016 have similar shape indices , but the highest redshift cluster , rx  j0153 , has significantly higher values than the two lower redshift clusters at all contour levels .",
    "this might indicate a possible evolutionary effect , but we can not make any general remarks with only three clusters and one each at each epoch .",
    "we defer any conclusion until we complete observations of most of the 15 clusters and make a statistical analysis on this plane .",

    "the higher redshift clusters at @xmath93 in the model , however , show much lower shape indices than observed , although they are still systematically slightly larger than those of the lower redshift clusters in the model .",

    "these structures are characterized by filaments coming out from the core and bridging some clumps along the filaments .",
    "these overall large - scale structures are in qualitative agreement with the numerical simulations , which predict an infall of clumps into the cluster cores travelling along the filaments during the course of cluster - scale assembly .",
    "moreover , we have taken a closer look at near or inside the cluster cores , and have identified complicated substructures that seem to be connected to the outer structures , and hence suggesting a recent accretion of matter from the surrounding filaments .",
    "the substructures of the main clusters were compared with the numerical simulation ( @xmath8-body + semi - analytic model ) applying the deviation of shapes of the iso - density contours from perfect circles . a quantitative agreement between the observation and the model",
    "was found at @xmath17 and @xmath98 , although the model predicts less evolution at @xmath99 .",
    "we do not know , however , whether this is a true evolutionary effect , or just an exception . to increase the sample of clusters",
    "is obviously needed to quantify any evolutionary signatures of clusters by distinguishing from the individualities of clusters .",
    "also , we need to extend the simulation box while keeping its resolution to have a statistically fair sample of rich clusters , so that we can directly compare them with our observed clusters .    the optical substructures in the inner regions of clusters and their neighbouring regions were also compared to the x - ray maps reproduced from the archived xmm data , and were found to have a good correlation with the x - ray extended emissions .",
    "this indicates that most of these sub - systems near the cluster cores are physically bound objects , rather than chance projections along the lines of sight .",
