    "see an illustration in figure [ fig : domain ] .",
    "the diffusion coefficient @xmath13 is discontinuous across the interface @xmath7 , and it is assumed to be a piecewise constant function defined by @xmath14 such that @xmath15 . across the interface @xmath7 , the solution and its flux",

    "[ fig : domain ]    conventional finite element ( fe ) methods can solve this elliptic interface problem satisfactorily provided that solution meshes are shaped to fit the material interface @xcite ; otherwise the accuracy of the solution is uncertain @xcite . _",
    "immersed finite element _ ( ife ) methods @xcite , on the other hand , do not require meshes to fit the interface .",
    "hence , if desired , cartesian meshes can be used to solve interface problems which is advantageous in many simulations .",
    "for example , in particle - in - cell methods for plasma particle simulations @xcite , it is preferable to solve the governing electric potential interface problem on cartesian meshes for efficient particle tracking .",
    "also , ife methods , in either a standard fully discrete or a semi discrete ( the method of lines ) formulation , can be used to solve time dependent problems with moving interfaces @xcite on a fixed cartesian mesh throughout the whole simulation .",
    "the fundamental idea of ife methods ( see e.g. @xcite ) , is to locally modify finite element functions on interface elements so that the interface jump conditions and are locally preserved in a certain sense . for elliptic interface problems ,",
    "most of ife methods in the literatures are adapted from the standard lagrange type conforming fe spaces whose degrees of freedom are determined by nodal values in a mesh .",
    "however , ife spaces originated from these conforming fe spaces are usually nonconforming because ife functions are discontinuous across interface edges .",
    "this discontinuity can be harmfully large for certain configuration of interface location and diffusion coefficient .",
    "consequently , the ife solution is often less accurate around the interface than the rest of solution domain .",
    "our recent numerical experiments reported in @xcite also indicate that the convergence rates of these conforming type ife functions used in galerkin formulation can deteriorate as the mesh size becomes very small .",
    "new _ partially penalized immersed finite element _ ( ppife ) methods are introduced in @xcite to cope with the negative impacts caused by the discontinuity in ife functions . in ppife schemes ,",
    "penalization terms are added to ife schemes which enables an enhance stability compared with classic ife methods in the galerkin formulation .",
    "the main idea of ppife arises from interior penalty discontinuous galerkin ( ipdg ) methods @xcite .",
    "however , in ppife methods , the stabilization terms are only added on interface edges compared to all interior edges for ipdg scheme @xcite . with the enhanced stability enforced by the penalty over interface edges ,",
    "these ppife schemes perform significantly better than classic ife methods in the sense that errors around the interface are reduced notably and optimal convergence are observed in both @xmath1 and energy norms without deterioration on fine meshes .",
    "more importantly , _ a priori _ optimal error estimates can be theoretically establish for these schemes provided that the solution space has piecewise @xmath19 regularity ( see @xcite ) .    in this article",
    ", we develop a new class of ife methods that uses an alternative approach to effectively alleviate the harmful impacts of discontinuity in ife functions . in this new framework",
    ", the continuity of ife function across element boundary is weakly enforced ; hence there is no need to add penalty terms in the new scheme .",
    "specifically , our new ife spaces are based on nonconforming finite element spaces @xcite rather than conforming lagrange type finite element spaces .",
    "one of the significant differences between conforming and nonconforming finite elements is how to enforce the continuity of finite element functions across elements .",
    "conforming fe functions impose the continuity through nodal values at mesh points , while the continuity of nonconforming fe functions is imposed through mean values over edges . for ife methods ,",
    "an interface edge is cut by the interface into two pieces .",
    "the restriction of an ife function to an interface edge leads to two piecewise polynomials from the two adjacent interface elements sharing this edge . in the conforming framework",
    ", these two piecewise polynomials coincide at the two endpoints of the interface edge , and this guarantees the continuity of the ife function at the end nodes of the interface edge but not the whole interface edge . on the other hand , in the nonconforming framework , the continuity across an element edge is weakly enforced over the whole edge in the integral sense , no matter whether it is a polynomial or a piecewise polynomial .",
    "thus we can take advantage of this nonconforming mechanism for constructing ife functions that weakly preserve continuity over the whole of each interface edge .",
    "the simplest nonconforming finite element defined on triangular meshes is the well - known crouzeix - raviart element @xcite . for rectangular meshes ,",
    "the simplest nonconforming finite elements are known as the _ rotated-@xmath0 finite elements _",
    "their degrees of freedom are determined either by values at midpoints of edges or by the integral values over edges .",
    "these two types of degrees of freedom coincide for crouzeix - raviart element .",
    "the crouzeix - raviart type ife method has been discussed in @xcite . in this article",
    ", we will develop new ife spaces based on the rotated-@xmath0 functions using both the midpoint - value and the integral - value degrees of freedom .",
    "as expected , the favored ife space is the one with integral - value degrees of freedom because of it preserves continuity of approximating functions across element boundaries .",
    "this feature enables us to derive optimal error estimates for galerkin ife solution in both energy norm and @xmath1 norm .",
    "the rest of this article is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we construct the nonconforming rotated-@xmath0 ife spaces and present their basic properties . in section 3 , we discuss the approximation capabilities of these ife spaces . in section 4 ,",
    "we analyze errors of galerkin solutions to the elliptic interface problem in energy and @xmath1 norms . in section 5 ,",
    "numerical results are presented to confirm our analysis and demonstrate features of the new ife methods .",
    "finally , a few brief conclusions are provided in section 6 .",
    "this section starts from notations and some preliminaries to be used in this paper .",
