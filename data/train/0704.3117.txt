    "the stability of a bound state composed of two electrons and a positron , the positronium negative ion , was first demonstrated in a seminal calculation by wheeler @xcite . shortly after this calculation",
    ", the four body systems , psh and ps@xmath11 were shown to be stable @xcite . since that time , only a few other electronically stable states have been discovered that can be formed from combinations of @xmath12,@xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "these are additional bound states of ps@xmath11 @xcite , a compound that is best described as @xmath10psh @xcite , and a ( @xmath12 , 4@xmath9 , 2@xmath10 ) complex @xcite .",
    "additionally , a number of atoms have been identified as being capable of binding positronium and positrons @xcite    just recently , a new class of positronic compounds that are electronically stable was identified @xcite .",
    "the new psh and naps bound states were unnatural parity states with symmetry conditions that act to prevent decay into the lowest energy dissociation products .",
    "an unnatural parity state is a state with parity equal to @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the orbital angular momentum of the state .",
    "these psh and naps systems have the two valence electrons in a spin - triplet state , a total orbital angular momentum of zero , and an odd parity , i.e. @xmath15 .",
    "in addition , these states had the unusual feature of decaying very slowly by @xmath16 or @xmath17 annihilation .    in this paper , more details about the @xmath15 negative parity states of psh and naps are given .",
    "negative parity states of lips and kps are also identified as being electronically stable .",
    "the lips state has the additional distinction of being a borromean state @xcite since the ( li@xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) system has no stable 3-body state that can act as a parent for the four body @xmath18s@xmath19 state .",
    "we have adopted the definition of richard : _ a bound state is borromean if there is no path to build it via a series of stable states by adding the constituents one by one _ @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that there are analogs of these states in the alkaline - earth sequence .",
    "configuration interaction ( ci ) approaches has been used to demonstrate the stability of the be@xmath20 , mg@xmath20 , ca@xmath20 and sr@xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22s@xmath19 states @xcite . however , the issue of whether an electron can be attached to the @xmath4p@xmath5 state of h@xmath20 into an @xmath22s@xmath19 state of h@xmath23 has been the subject of some controversy .",
    "a complex rotation method was applied to a large basis ci wave function and a shape threshold lying about 1.4 ev above the @xmath4p@xmath5 threshold was predicted @xcite .",
    "however , this was contradicted by a much more sophisticated hyperspherical calculation that exhibited no sign of a resonance @xcite .",
    "the stability of these systems lies in the symmetry relations between the pairs of particles that make up the system .",
    "the discussion of these conditions will be addressed specifically to psh , but these conditions , with some small modifications , will also apply to the other systems addressed in this paper .",
    "the electronic stability of psh can be motivated by consideration of the h@xmath20(@xmath24 @xmath4p@xmath5 ) bound state @xcite .",
    "this state has an energy of @xmath25 hartree @xcite and is electronically stable due to symmetry conditions .",
    "it can not decay into the h(@xmath26 ) + @xmath9 channel since the @xmath27 partial wave of the electron automatically results in a state of negative parity .",
    "the @xmath15 state of psh is formed when the positron is trapped into a @xmath28 state of the h@xmath20 attractive potential well .",
    "the possible decay modes are constrained by the symmetry conditions .",
    "dissociation into ps(@xmath26)+h(@xmath26 ) is forbidden since @xmath29 where @xmath14 is the orbital angular momentum between the ps(@xmath26 ) and h(@xmath26 ) fragments .",
    "similarly , dissociation into ps(@xmath30)+h(@xmath31 ) or ps(@xmath31)+h(@xmath30 ) does not occur since it is not possible to construct an @xmath32 state if one of the angular momentum is zero .",
    "the lowest energy dissociation channel would be into ps(@xmath28)+h(@xmath28 ) ( with the two fragments in a @xmath6-wave ) with an energy threshold of @xmath33 hartree .",
    "another possible decay would be into the h@xmath20(@xmath24 @xmath4p@xmath34 ) + @xmath10 channel but the threshold energy here is @xmath25 hartree @xcite .",
    "it is easy to see that there is potentially a large energy advantage associated with binding the positron to the negative ion .",
    "if the h@xmath20 state is regarded as a point particle with an internal energy of @xmath35 hartree , then a positron in the @xmath28 state will lower the total energy to @xmath36 hartree .",
    "in actuality the h@xmath20(@xmath24 @xmath4p@xmath5 ) state is diffuse @xcite , but the advantage of attaching the positron to the negative ion is clear .",
    "the dominant electron - positron annihilation processes are the @xmath16 and @xmath17 processes .",
    "the 2@xmath37 annihilation rate for bound systems is proportional to the probability of finding an electron and a positron at the same position in a spin - singlet state according to @xmath38 @xcite , where the sum is over the electron coordinates , the @xmath39-function expectation is evaluated in @xmath40 , and @xmath41 is given numerically in s@xmath42 .",
    "the operator @xmath43 is a spin projection operator to select spin - singlet states for the @xmath44 electron - positron pairs in the wave - function @xmath45 which is anti - symmetrized in the electron coordinates .",
    "the rate constant for the ps ground state is about @xmath46 s@xmath42 . equation ( [ gamma1 ] ) involves a contact interaction which means that the relative angular momentum of the annihilating pair ( @xmath47 ) must be zero @xcite . however , electron - positron annihilation is possible even for when the relative angular momentum of the annihilating pair is greater than zero .",
    "for example the ps(@xmath28 ) levels can undergo @xmath16 annihilation at rates proportional to @xmath48 and @xmath49 respectively @xcite .",
    "the rates for the different ps(@xmath28 ) levels have been calculated to be approximately 10@xmath22 s@xmath42 @xcite .",
    "similarly , the @xmath17 process , which happens when the annihilating pair are in a spin - triplet state , can also occur at a rate proportional to @xmath49 when the pair have a relative angular momentum of 1 .",
    "the discussions below about the symmetry conditions for positron annihilation concern the fast @xmath16 and @xmath17 processes for pairs in relative @xmath50-states .",
    "consider the electron - positron annihilation of a psh state of @xmath51s@xmath19 symmetry .",
    "the relative angular momentum of the annihilating pair ( @xmath47 ) must be zero .",
    "this means the total angular momentum of the state will come from the center - of - mass motion of the annihilating pair ( @xmath52 ) , and from the angular momentum of the spectator electron ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "the total parity of the state is determined by the parity of the individual constituents , i.e. @xmath54 .",
    "it is simply not possible to form an odd parity state with a total angular momentum of zero if any one of the angular momenta is zero .",
    "consequently , a two electron / one positron state of @xmath51s@xmath19 symmetry can not decay by the fast @xmath16 process .",
    "these arguments also apply to the @xmath17 annihilation process .",
    "the @xmath17 process occurs for electron - positron pairs in a spin - triplet state with a relative angular momentum of zero .",
    "once again , it is simply impossible to form a state of @xmath51s@xmath19 ( or @xmath55s@xmath19 ) symmetry if the relative angular momentum of the annihilating pair is zero .",
    "so it is reasonable to conclude that the lowest order @xmath17 decay is not possible from a @xmath18s@xmath19 state .",
    "a majority of the calculations in the present paper were performed with a configuration interaction approach @xcite .",
    "the ci basis was constructed by letting the two electrons ( particles 1 and 2 ) and the positron ( particle 0 ) form all the possible total angular momentum @xmath56 configurations , with the two electrons in a spin - triplet state , subject to the selection rules , @xmath57 in these rules @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are respectively the orbital angular momenta of the positron and the two electrons .",
    "we define @xmath61 to be the energy of the calculation with a maximum orbital angular momentum of @xmath62 .",
    "the single particle orbitals were laguerre type orbitals ( ltos ) with a common exponent chosen for all the orbitals of a common @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "the orbital basis sets for the positron and electrons were identical .",
    "a major technical problem afflicting ci calculations of positron - atom interactions is the slow convergence of the energy with @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath64 energy , @xmath65 , is determined by the use of an asymptotic analysis .",
    "the successive increments , @xmath66 , to the energy can be written as an inverse power series @xcite , viz @xmath67 the first term in the series starts with a power of 6 since all the possible couplings of any two of the particles result in unnatural parity states @xcite .",
    "the @xmath68 limit , has been determined by fitting sets of @xmath61 values to asymptotic series with either 1 , 2 , 3 or 4 terms .",
    "the coefficients , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 for the 4-term expansion are determined at a particular @xmath62 from 5 successive energies ( @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 ) . once the coefficients have been determined it is easy to sum the series to @xmath78 and obtain the variational limit .",
    "application of asymptotic series analysis to helium has resulted in ci calculations reproducing the ground state energy to an accuracy of @xmath79 hartree @xcite .",
    "the treatment of the alkalis li , na and k requires the use of a frozen core approximation .",
    "the details of this approximation have been discussed in great detail elsewhere @xcite , so only the briefest description is given here .",
    "the model hamiltonian is initially based on a hartree - fock ( hf ) wave function for the neutral atom ground state .",
    "the core orbitals are then frozen .",
    "the direct part of the core potential is attractive for electrons and repulsive for the positron .",
    "the impact of the direct and exchange part of the hf core interactions on the active particles are computed without approximation .",
    "one- and two - body semi - empirical polarization potentials are then added to the potential .",
    "the adjustable parameters of the core - polarization potential are defined by reference to the spectrum of neutral atom @xcite .      in the stochastic variational approach an explicitly correlated gaussian ( ecg )",
    "is constructed by placing the particles ( electrons and positrons ) into gaussian single particle orbitals @xmath80 and using a @xmath81 gaussian correlation function between the @xmath82th and @xmath83th particles .",

    "the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers @xmath90 are restricted to occupy the lowest possible values consistent with the overall symmetry of the state .",
    "the spherical part of the ecg basis functions effectively allows internal angular momentum to be distributed between the different parts of the systems .",
