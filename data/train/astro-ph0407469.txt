    "infrared luminous galaxies ( l@xmath5 @xmath6 10@xmath7l@xmath8 ) , discovered with the _ iras _ all sky survey , radiate most of their luminosity as dust emission in the infrared @xcite .",
    "thus , powerful energy sources , either starbursts and/or active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , are present hidden behind dust . as the bright end of the local luminosity function is dominated by these infrared luminous galaxies @xcite , they constitute a very important population in the local universe . at high redshift , these infrared luminous galaxies dominate the cosmic infrared background emission , and have been used to trace the dust - obscured star formation rate , dust content , and metallicity in the early universe , based on the assumption that they are powered by starbursts @xcite . estimating the fraction of their infrared luminosities that is powered by individual activity ( i.e. , starbursts and agns ) is fundamental not only to unveil the true nature of these galaxies but also to understand obscured agn - starburst connections in the universe . as distant sources are too faint to investigate in detail with existing observing facilities ,",
    "a complete understanding of these infrared luminous galaxies in the nearby universe is a first step to achieving these goals .",
    "if agns are present and obscured by dust in a _ torus _ geometry , then clouds along the torus axis are photo - ionized by the agn s hard radiation ( these are the so - called narrow line regions : nlrs ; robson 1996 ) .",
    "the nlrs produce optical emission lines with flux ratios that are distinguishable from those of normal star - forming galaxies , so agns obscured by torus - shaped dust are detectable through optical spectroscopy ( classified as seyferts ; veilleux , kim , & sanders 1999a ) .",
    "such obscured agns are also recognizable by detecting strong high - excitation forbidden emission lines , originating in the nlrs , in high - resolution near- to mid - infrared spectra @xcite .",
    "approximately 1020% of nearby ( @xmath9 0.3 ) infrared luminous galaxies with l@xmath5 @xmath10 10@xmath7l@xmath8 are known to possess such agns ( veilleux et al .",
    "1999a , b ) .",
    "however , since the nuclear regions of infrared luminous galaxies are very dusty @xcite , agns resident in the majority of these galaxies may be deeply embedded in dust along all sightlines . in",
    "such _ buried _ agns , x - ray dissociation regions dominated by low - ionization species @xcite develop , rather than nlrs , so that the signatures of buried agns are difficult to find using the conventional methods described above .",
    "a recent detailed investigation of the local infrared 60 @xmath1 m luminosity function has indirectly suggested that buried agns may be energetically important in infrared luminous galaxies @xcite .",
    "it is desirable to establish a method by which to reveal the presence of buried agns more directly and persuasively , and to quantitatively determine their energetic importance in infrared luminous galaxies .",
    "observations at wavelengths where dust extinction is low are clearly a powerful way to investigate buried agns .",
    "some methods have been proposed , including thermal infrared ( 325 @xmath1 m ) imaging @xcite and spectroscopic observations @xcite , millimeter interferometric observations @xcite , and high energy x - ray observations @xcite .",
    "some of these methods have succeeded in providing strong evidence for buried agns in some optically - non - seyfert infrared luminous galaxies .",
    "examples include arp 299 @xcite , ngc 4945 @xcite , iras 08572 + 3915 @xcite , and ugc 5101 @xcite .",
    "however , even in these galaxies , the properties of the energy sources investigated using independent methods are not completely quantitatively consistent , primarily because these sources may be agn / starburst composites , rather than pure buried agns or pure starbursts , and because correction for dust extinction can cause some ambiguity .",
    "it is important to observe selected buried agn candidates in more detail , by combining these potentially powerful methods , and to draw a quantitatively consistent picture of their energy sources .",
    "ngc 4418 , at @xmath11 = 0.007 , is one of the closest and strongest buried agn candidates .",
    "it has an infrared luminosity of l@xmath5 @xmath4 9 @xmath12 10@xmath13l@xmath8 (= 10@xmath14 ergs s@xmath15 ; see table 1 ) , and shows no clear seyfert signatures in its optical spectrum @xcite .",
    "the 523 @xmath1 m mid - infrared spectrum of ngc 4418 has the typical shape of an obscured agn @xcite .",
    "based on an 823 @xmath1 m mid - infrared spectrum , @xcite argued that the energy source of ngc 4418 is very compact and more centrally - concentrated than surrounding dust , as is expected for a buried agn .",
    "the core of ngc 4418 is spatially very compact ( @xmath160@xmath175 ) in the infrared and radio @xcite , again suggesting the presence of a compact energy source like an agn . from far - infrared spectroscopy ,",
    "ngc 4418 is known to be an unusually weak [ cii ] ( 158 @xmath1 m ) emitter relative to its far - infrared luminosity @xcite .",
    "the presence of a powerful buried agn is one explanation for this @xcite , although some alternative scenarios exist @xcite . in this way ,",
    "evidence for a powerful buried agn at the center of ngc 4418 has been accumulated .",
    "however , the evidence still may not be conclusive @xcite .",
    "further constraints on the nuclear energy source of ngc 4418 from the use of other techniques are clearly warranted . in this paper",
    ", we report on near - infrared @xmath0- ( 2.02.5 @xmath1 m ) and @xmath3-band ( 2.84.1 @xmath1 m ) spectroscopic observations as well as millimeter ( 3.4 mm ) observations using both a single dish telescope and an interferometric array . throughout this paper , @xmath18 @xmath19 75 km",
    "s@xmath15 mpc@xmath15 , @xmath20 = 0.3 , and @xmath21 = 0.7 are adopted , so that the distance to ngc 4418 is 28.2 mpc and 1 arcsec corresponds to 130 pc .",
    "near - infrared spectroscopic observations were performed with spex @xcite at the irtf 3-m telescope on mauna kea , hawaii , on 2003 march 18 ( ut ) . the 1.94.2 @xmath1 m cross - dispersed mode with a 08 wide slit",
    "was employed , so that both @xmath0- ( 2.02.5 @xmath1 m ) and @xmath3-band ( 2.84.1 @xmath1 m ) spectra were taken simultaneously with a resolution of r @xmath4 1000 .",
    "the sky conditions were photometric and the seeing size at @xmath0 was measured to be @xmath40@xmath176 ( full - width at half - maximum ; fwhm ) .",
    "the position angle of the slit was set along the north - south direction . a standard telescope nodding technique ( abba pattern )",
    "was employed along the slit to subtract background emission .",
    "we set the throw between the a and b positions to be 7.5 arcsec , because infrared 220 @xmath1 m emission from ngc 4418 is dominated by the compact nucleus @xcite . with this",
    "throw , the signal from the object was always inside the slit ( 15 arcsec long ) .",
    "the telescope tracking was monitored with the infrared slit - viewer of spex .",
    "each exposure was 15 sec , and 2 coadds were employed at each position . with this exposure time , signals at @xmath22 @xmath10 4.1 @xmath1 m ( in the observed frame ) exceed the linearity level of the spex array , and so data at @xmath22 @xmath10 4.1 @xmath1 m were removed .",
    "one abba cycle results in a 2-min ( 15 sec @xmath12 2 coadds @xmath12 4 positions ) exposure time .",
    "this cycle was repeated 40 times and so the total net on - source integration time was 80 min .",
    "an f8-type main sequence star , hr 4708 , was observed as a standard star , with an airmass difference of @xmath230.05 to ngc 4418 , to correct for the transmission of the earth s atmosphere .",
    "the @xmath0- and @xmath3-band magnitudes of hr 4708 were estimated to be @xmath0 = 5.04 and @xmath3 = 4.99 mag , respectively , from its @xmath24-band ( 0.6 @xmath1 m ) magnitude ( 6.40 mag ) , adopting the @xmath25 and @xmath26 colors of an f8 type main sequence star @xcite .",
    "standard data reduction procedures were employed using iraf .",
    "first , bad pixels and pixels hit by cosmic rays were replaced with the interpolated values of the surrounding pixels .",
    "then , frames taken with an a ( or b ) beam were subtracted from frames subsequently taken with a b ( or a ) beam , and the resulting subtracted frames were added and then divided by a spectroscopic flat image .",
    "the spectra of ngc 4418 and hr 4708 were then extracted by integrating signals over 2@xmath174 along the slit .",
    "wavelength calibration was performed using the wavelength - dependent transmission of the earth s atmosphere .",
    "the ngc 4418 spectrum was divided by that of hr 4708 , and was multiplied by the spectrum of a blackbody with t@xmath27 = 6000 k , corresponding to an f8-type main sequence star @xcite .",
    "flux - calibration was made based on the signals detected inside our slit and on the adopted magnitudes of hr 4708 .    in the @xmath3-band spectrum , s / n ratios in the continuum are much worse than those in the @xmath0-band , because of the higher background signals from the earth s atmosphere in the former .",
    "thus , appropriate spectral binning to r @xmath4 150 was applied . for an obscured agn candidate such as ngc 4418 ,",
    "the targeted features in the @xmath3-band are the 3.1 @xmath1 m absorption feature caused by ice - covered dust grains , the 3.3 @xmath1 m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission feature , and the 3.4 @xmath1 m absorption feature due to bare carbonaceous dust grains @xcite .",
    "since all of these features are spectrally broad , the adopted spectral resolution is sufficient to investigate their properties .",
    "since ngc 4418 is a nearby source , the pah emission , one of the important features used in our scientific interpretation , has a peak at 3.313 @xmath1 m (= 3.29 @xmath1 m @xmath12 1.007 ) . at 3.313.32 @xmath1 m",
    "a deep methane absorption feature is present owing to the earth s atmosphere , peaking at 3.315 @xmath1 m , so the transmission of signals from celestial objects is extremely low and the background level is very high , both of which make a spectrum very noisy around this wavelength range .",
    "thus , the determined pah emission flux can be uncertain if based only on a single spectrum .",
    "an independent spectrum taken at a different time with a different instrument is important for a quantitative discussion .",
    "an @xmath3-band spectrum of ngc 4418 was also taken with nirc @xcite at the keck i 10-m telescope on 2000 march 24 ( ut ) , under clear weather conditions .",
    "the lm + gr60 grism was used with a 4.5-pix slit ( 0@xmath1768 wide ) .",
    "the resulting spectral resolution is r @xmath4 70 .",
    "the position angle of the slit was set to 35@xmath28 east of north .",
    "signals were taken at five positions separated by 4@xmath178 along the slit .",
    "each exposure was 0.41 sec , and 100 coadds were employed at each position .",
    "the total net on - source integration time was 41 min ( 0.41 sec @xmath12 100 coadds @xmath12 5 positions @xmath12 12 cycles ) .",
    "hd 106965 ( l = 7.295 ) was observed as a standard star , with an airmass difference of @xmath230.05 to ngc 4418 , to correct for the transmission of the earth s atmosphere .",
    "data reduction procedures were carried out using iraf , in a similar way as those employed for the irtf spex spectrum .",
    "first , bias and dark frames were subtracted from each frame , and then the successive frame was subtracted . after flat - field and bad - pixel corrections had been applied , the frames were shifted , and then summed to extract a spectrum .",
    "wavelength calibration was carried out using the wavelength - dependent transmission of the earth s atmosphere .",
    "the ngc 4418 spectrum was divided by that of hd 106965 , multiplied by the spectrum of a blackbody with t@xmath27 = 8500 k , flux - calibrated , and then a final spectrum was obtained .",
    "we used the 45-m telescope of the nobeyama radio observatory ( nro ) to measure the luminosity of hcn ( 10 ) ( @xmath29 = 3.3848 mm or @xmath30 = 88.632 ghz ) .",
    "the half - power beam width ( hpbw ) of the telescope was @xmath419 arcsec , and the main beam efficiency was @xmath40.51 at this wavelength ( frequency ) .",
    "the hcn observations were made on 2002 november 28 ( ut ) , under clear weather conditions .",
    "the hcn - line data were taken simultaneously with two sis receivers , s80 and s100 , which can observe two orthogonal polarizations simultaneously . however , the performance of s80 was unstable during our observations , and thus we used only s100 data for our analysis .",
    "the receiver backends were 2048 channel wide - band acousto - optical spectrometers ( aoss ) .",
    "the frequency resolution and the total band width were 250 khz and 250 mhz , respectively , which correspond to 0.85 km s@xmath15 and 850 km s@xmath15 at the observed wavelength ( frequency ) .",
    "an intensity calibration was performed using the chopper wheel method . the system noise temperatures ( ssb ) , including the antenna ohmic loss and the earth s atmospheric effect , were 230280 k at the observed wavelength ( frequency ) .",
    "the telescope pointing was checked every 50 minutes by observing the bright quasar 3c 273 .",
    "we used a position - switching mode with an integration time of 20 sec for on- and off - source .",
    "the pointing of the nro 45-m telescope is very sensitive to wind . to obtain a reliable flux estimate",
    ", we used only data taken during calm wind conditions ( wind speed @xmath16 10 m s@xmath15 ) for the analysis .",
    "the total net on - source exposure time for the hcn observations was 5600 sec .",
    "data analysis was made using the software newstar and aips in a standard manner . in each frame , the stability of the baseline was checked by eye , and data with unstable baselines were removed .",
    "the baseline was fit with a first order polynomial function and subtracted from the actual spectrum to show the hcn line spectrum .",
    "interferometric observations of hcn ( 10 ) and hco+ ( 10 ) ( @xmath29 = 3.3637 mm or @xmath30 = 89.188 ghz ) were performed with the rainbow interferometer at nro on 2004 january 27 and 28 ( ut ) under clear and virtually windless ( wind speed @xmath23 5 m s@xmath15 ) observing conditions .",
    "the rainbow interferometer is the seven - element combined array that includes six 10-m antennas ( nobeyama millimeter array ; nma ) and the nro 45-m telescope . during the daytime of the first observation",
    "( january 27 ) , there was snow fall , and frozen ice on the surface of the primary mirror of the 45-m telescope had not melted completely by the time of our night observations .",
    "thus , only six 10-m antennas ( i.e. , the nma ) , with the ab array configuration , were used for the observations . in this ab configuration ,",
    "the longest baseline was 350 m. on the second night , all seven antennas ( i.e. , rainbow ) were used , with a longest baseline of 410 m.    the backend was the ultra - wide - band correlator , uwbc @xcite , which was configured to cover 1024 mhz with 128 channels at 8 mhz resolution .",
    "the central frequency was set to be 88.29 ghz , so that both the hcn and hco+ lines redshifted to 88.016 ghz and 88.569 ghz , respectively , were simultaneously observable .",
    "the band width of 1024 mhz corresponds to @xmath43500 km s@xmath15 at @xmath31 @xmath4 88 ghz .",
    "since the hanning window function was applied to reduce side lobes in spectra , the actual resolution was widened to 16 mhz or 55 km s@xmath15 at @xmath31 @xmath4 88 ghz .",
    "the bright quasar 3c 273 was used to calibrate temporal variations in the visibility amplitude and phase , as well as passband across the 128 channels . as the nro 45-m telescope is very sensitive to wind , the maser source r - com was prepared to use as a pointing check . however , wind was very weak on the second night and the visibility amplitudes between the 10-m antennas and the 45-m antenna were sufficiently large throughout the observations .",
    "no pointing check was made for the 45-m telescope .",
    "standard data reduction was employed using the package uvproc - ii developed at nro @xcite . for the second night",
    "s data , the position dependence of the secondary mirror of the 45-m telescope on elevation was first corrected . for both days data , antenna baselines , bandpass properties , and the time variation of visibility amplitude and phase",
    "were corrected for , using the 3c  273 data .",
    "data taken during some fraction of the observing time showed large phase scatters , owing to bad radio seeing .",
    "as these datasets are useless , they were removed . after clipping a small fraction of unusually high amplitude data ,",
    "the data were fourier - transformed using a natural _ uv _ weighting .",
    "the flux - calibration of ngc 4418 was made by observing the quasar 1741@xmath32038 , whose flux level relative to uranus had been measured . since the declination of ngc 4418 is almost 0@xmath28 , strong side lobes were evident along the north - south direction .",
    "a conventional clean method was applied to deconvolve the synthesized beam pattern .",
    "figure 1 shows a flux - calibrated infrared @xmath0-band slit spectrum of ngc 4418 , taken with irtf spex .",
    "the signals integrated over 0@xmath178 @xmath12 2@xmath174 give @xmath0 = 12.6 mag , which is in reasonable agreement with previously obtained photometric measurements using small apertures ; @xmath0 = 12.8 mag ( 1@xmath177 ) by @xcite , or @xmath0 = 13.3 mag ( 1@xmath171 ) and @xmath0 = 11.8 mag ( 5@xmath33 ) ( _ hst _ nicmos measurements ) by @xcite .",
    "thus , slit loss in our spectrum is expected to be insignificant .    regarding the @xmath0-band spectrum of ngc 4418 , only a low - resolution ( r @xmath4 100 ) spectrum",
    "has previously been reported by @xcite , who argued that the @xmath0-band spectrum is typical of a normal star - forming galaxy , with the exception of a strong h@xmath2 10 s(1 ) emission line at @xmath29 = 2.122 @xmath1 m . our higher resolution ( r @xmath4 1000 ) spectrum newly reveals multiple h@xmath2 emission lines , and enables quantitative measurements .",
    "important emission lines are indicated in figure 1 , and their properties are summarized in table 2 . the rest - frame equivalent width of the h@xmath2 10 s(1 ) emission was measured to be ew@xmath34 = 36 @xmath35 , which is significantly larger than in the majority of infrared luminous galaxies ( @xmath1620 @xmath35 ; goldader et al .",

    "1997a ) .",
    "there is a gap in the continuum level of the spectrum between @xmath38 2.3 @xmath1 m and @xmath10 2.3 @xmath1 m .",
    "we attribute the gap to co absorption features at @xmath29 = 2.312.4 @xmath1 m , which are usually found in star - forming galaxies @xcite . to estimate the absorption strength ,",
    "we basically follow the method proposed by doyon , joseph , & wright ( 1994 ) , who defined a spectroscopic co index as @xmath39 where @xmath23r@xmath40@xmath10 is the average of actual signals at @xmath29 = 2.312.40 @xmath1 m divided by a power - law continuum ( f@xmath41 = @xmath42 ) extrapolated from shorter wavelengths .",
    "a continuum level is determined using data points at @xmath29 = 2.02.29 @xmath1 m , excluding obvious emission lines . when co absorption is present , @xmath23r@xmath40@xmath10 should be less than unity and thus co@xmath43 should have a positive value .",

    "this value substantially exceeds the lower limit of 10@xmath15 m@xmath8 yr@xmath15 kpc@xmath65 beyond which superwind activity , a characteristic property of starbursts , can occur @xcite .",
    "we thus conclude that the detected 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission comes from nuclear starbursts , rather than central regions of quiescent star - forming activity in the host galaxy .",
    "the measured 3.3 @xmath1 m pah to infrared luminosity ratio in ngc 4418 is @xmath42 @xmath12 10@xmath67 , which is a factor of @xmath450 smaller than starburst - dominated galaxies ( @xmath410@xmath68 ; mouri et al .",
    "1990 ; imanishi 2002 ) , suggesting that the detected nuclear starbursts , with modest dust extinction in the near - infrared 34 @xmath1 m , contribute very little to the total infrared luminosity of ngc 4418 .",
    "since the infrared luminosity is likely to come from the compact nuclear core @xcite , rather than extended star formation in the host galaxy , the dominant energy source , an agn and/or very compact starbursts , should be deeply buried at the core .",
    "figure 8 shows a plot of the hcn ( 10 ) to co ( 10 ) ( @xmath69 = 2.6 mm ) and hcn ( 10 ) to hco+ ( 10 ) luminosity ratios of ngc 4418 and other nearby galaxies .",
    "empirically , a pure agn ( with no detectable nuclear star - forming activity ) shows high hcn / hco+ and hcn / co luminosity ratios , as compared to star - forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "since hcn traces much higher - density molecular gas ( n@xmath70 @xmath4 10@xmath71 cm@xmath68 ) than is traced by co ( n@xmath73 @xmath4 10@xmath53 cm@xmath68 ) , the hcn / co ratio can vary depending on the density of molecular gas .",
    "however , both hcn and hco+ probe molecular gas of similar density ( n@xmath70 @xmath4 10@xmath71 cm@xmath68 ) , so that the hcn / hco+ ratio is robust to the density of molecular gas .",
    "the high hcn / hco+ ratio in an agn may be owing to the enhancement of hcn in molecular gas irradiated by strong x - ray emission from the agn @xcite .",
    "although a full explanation for this high hcn / hco+ ratio in an agn is still to be developed , this empirical method can be used to find a buried agn , because of negligible dust extinction in the millimeter wavelength range .",
    "the high hcn / hco+ luminosity ratio at the nucleus of ngc 4418 suggests the presence of a buried agn .",
    "the strong co absorption in the near - infrared @xmath0-band , and strong 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission in the @xmath3-band , suggest that emission from normal star - formation has an important contribution to the observed fluxes in these wavelength ranges",
    ". however , the h@xmath2 emission in the @xmath0-band spectrum is unusually strong as compared to that of normal star - forming galaxies @xcite . in normal star - forming galaxies , the h@xmath2 10 s(1 ) to br@xmath74 emission - line luminosity ratios ( l@xmath34/l@xmath75 ) are smaller than or comparable to unity @xcite .",
    "the l@xmath34/l@xmath75 ratio of @xmath108 ( table 2 ) in ngc 4418 is unusually large .",
    "together with the large h@xmath2 equivalent width ( ew@xmath34 ) of ngc 4418 , this suggests that in addition to emission from normal star - forming activity , some mechanism that can produce strong h@xmath2 emission should exist at the nucleus of ngc 4418 .",
    "figure 9 shows the luminosity ratios of some h@xmath2 emission lines .",
    "the small observed 21 s(1 ) to 10 s(1 ) luminosity ratio with @xmath230.3 is incompatible with the non - thermal ( uv fluorescence ) model as the primary emission mechanism for the detected strong h@xmath2 emission , and favors h@xmath2 emission of thermal origin .",
    "based on the available h@xmath2 data alone , some thermal models , including shocks , x - ray heating , and uv , are not clearly distinguishable .",
    "however , the measured hcn / hco+ ratio can help to distinguish among these scenarios .    in the case of the strong h@xmath2-emitting galaxy ngc 6240",
    ", the h@xmath2 emission was found to be of thermal origin @xcite , and to come from regions between the double nucleus of ngc 6240 @xcite .",
    "shocks driven by a galaxy - merger or superwind have been proposed as the primary mechanism of the h@xmath2 emission @xcite . from these shock regions , a low hcn / hco+ ratio with @xmath40.67 was observed @xcite . the low hcn / hco+ ratio in shock regions may be due to the enhancement of hco+ @xcite .",
    "however , ngc 4418 is a single nucleus source , with no clear signs of recent galaxy - merger / interaction @xcite .",
    "furthermore , at the nucleus of ngc 4418 , a high hcn / hco+ ratio was measured , as found in pure agns .",
    "given that stellar uv heating of molecular gas is also expected to show a low hcn / hco+ ratio @xcite , x - ray heating of h@xmath2 molecules caused by the putative buried agn @xcite seems plausible .",
    "the observed h@xmath2 line luminosity ratios are consistent with this x - ray heating scenario , if the h@xmath2 emission suffers from dust extinction with a@xmath76 @xmath4 several mag ( see fig.9 ) .",
    "ngc 4418 is known to show a very strong 9.7 @xmath1 m silicate dust absorption feature , whose optical depth was measured to be @xmath77 = 5.67 @xcite . adopting the relation of @xmath77/a@xmath78 = 0.050.1 established in the galactic interstellar medium @xcite , we obtain a dust extinction toward the @xmath410 @xmath1 m continuum emitting regions of @xmath79 @xmath10 50 mag , or a@xmath76 @xmath10 5 mag @xcite . in the case of a dust envelope around a buried agn (= a centrally concentrated energy source ) , dust has a strong temperature gradient in that inner ( outer ) dust has a higher ( lower ) temperature .",
    "the 10 @xmath1 m continuum typically comes from 300-k dust , which is located in the outer parts , compared to the innermost dust sublimation radius ( t = 10001500 k ) .",
    "thus , the estimated a@xmath78 traces the dust column toward some outer part of the dust envelope around the buried agn .",
    "h@xmath2 emission excited by x - rays also comes from some outer regions of the dust envelope , similarly to the 300-k dust .",
    "if we adopt a value for the dust extinction toward the h@xmath2-emitting regions of a@xmath76 @xmath10 5 mag , the model prediction of x - ray heating in figure 9 will go down , and move slightly to the right , which is consistent with the current observational constraints on the h@xmath2 emission line luminosity ratios .",
    "the scenario of x - ray heating by the buried agn can also explain the following observational results : ( 1 ) the large h@xmath2 s(1 ) to br@xmath74 luminosity ratio , ( 2 ) the large equivalent width of the h@xmath2 10 s(1 ) emission line ( ew@xmath34 ) , and ( 3 ) the small h@xmath2 s(1 ) to infrared luminosity ratio ( l@xmath34/l@xmath80 ) . on point ( 1 ) , agns generally show significantly larger h@xmath2",
    "10 s(1 ) to br@xmath74 luminosity ratios ( l@xmath34/l@xmath81 @xmath10 1 ) than do star - forming galaxies ( @xmath231 ; mouri & taniguchi 1992 ) . on point",
    "( 2 ) , the h@xmath2 equivalent width ( ew@xmath34 ) of ngc 4418 is in the highest range observed for agns @xcite . in a buried agn , the covering fraction of the central agn by molecular gas is higher than that of a typical agn surrounded by torus - shaped molecular gas .",
    "this higher covering fraction can produce stronger x - ray heated h@xmath2 emission .",
    "additionally , the near - infrared @xmath0-band continuum from an agn originates mostly from 1000- to 1500-k dust close to the innermost , dust sublimation radius @xcite .",
    "the high obscuration toward the central agn in ngc 4418 , as is implied from the presence of one of the strongest 9.7 @xmath1 m silicate dust absorption features observed @xcite , can significantly attenuate the agn - originated @xmath0-band continuum flux .",
    "the flux attenuation of h@xmath2 emission from some outer part of the dust envelope is slightly smaller than the @xmath0-band continuum , producing a higher h@xmath2 equivalent width than in the case of unobscured agns .",
    "finally , on point ( 3 ) , since the h@xmath2 emission from the buried agn in ngc 4418 is likely to be more highly dust obscured than typical agns , the small l@xmath34/l@xmath5 ratio can be explained by dust extinction .    with dust extinction of a@xmath76 @xmath10 5 mag , the dereddened h@xmath2 10 s(1 )",
    "luminosity becomes @xmath101.3 @xmath12 10@xmath64 ergs s@xmath15 , and the dereddened l@xmath34 to l@xmath5 ratio is @xmath104 @xmath12 10@xmath82 .",
    "the intrinsic x - ray luminosity that produces this h@xmath2 10 s(1 ) luminosity is estimated to be l@xmath83(110kev ) @xmath10 1 @xmath12 10@xmath66 ergs s@xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the resulting 110 kev x - ray to infrared luminosity ratio is l@xmath84(110kev)/l@xmath5 @xmath10 0.3 , which is as high as those in agn - powered infrared luminous galaxies @xcite .",
    "thus , in this x - ray heated h@xmath2 emission scenario , the putative buried agn could account for the bulk of the infrared luminosity from ngc 4418 .    in summary ,",
    "all the data newly available from our observations , including the high hcn / hco+ ratio , h@xmath2 emission line luminosity ratios , large h@xmath2 to br@xmath74 luminosity ratio , and large h@xmath2 equivalent width , can be consistently explained by the buried agn scenario",
    ".    the infrared to hcn luminosity ratio of ngc 4418 is located in the highest part of the scattered range of infrared luminous starburst galaxies ( figure 4 ) .",
    "if this ratio is similar to that of starburst galaxies , it is sometimes used to argue that the infrared luminosity of a source is starburst - powered @xcite . however",
    ", it simply indicates that much of the infrared emission arises from dust in dense molecular clouds ( probed by hcn ) whatever the energy source of the luminosities may be @xcite .",
    "the buried agn in ngc 4418 is most likely to be surrounded by high density gas , as is the case for stars at the star - forming cores of starburst galaxies , and so the similar infrared - to - hcn ratio of ngc 4418 to that of starburst galaxies is quite reasonable .",
    "the presence of buried agns in some non - seyfert ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) with l@xmath5 @xmath10 10@xmath85l@xmath8 has been revealed from @xmath3-band spectra , based on significantly lower equivalent widths of the 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission feature ( ew@xmath47 ) than starbursts , with strong absorption features @xcite , whereas ngc 4418 shows no such signature in the @xmath3-band spectrum . this @xmath3-band spectroscopic method to find",
    "a buried agn is possible only if the agn - powered dust emission contributes significantly to the observed flux . in ulirgs",
    ", this is often the case @xcite .",
    "however , in the case of ngc 4418 , the observed @xmath3-band flux is unfortunately dominated by stellar emission , rather than dust emission @xcite , making it difficult to find the buried agn signatures in the @xmath3-band spectrum .",
    "the buried agn scenario in ngc 4418 presumes the presence of an intrinsically strong x - ray emitting energy source .",
    "no significant x - ray emission was detected at e @xmath23 10 kev @xcite .",
    "it has been found that agns in roughly half of seyfert-2 galaxies suffer from compton - thick ( n@xmath70 @xmath10 10@xmath86 @xmath49 ) absorption @xcite . in a compton - thick agn ,",
    "the observed 210 kev emission is dominated by a scattered / reflected component , rather than a direct , transmitted component , making the observed 210 kev flux very weak . the significantly deeper 9.7 @xmath1 m silicate dust absorption feature in ngc 4418",
    "as compared to typical seyfert-2 galaxies @xcite makes it very likely that the putative agn in ngc 4418 is obscured by compton - thick absorbing material .",
    "sensitive x - ray observations at e @xmath10 10 kev are most desirable to unveil the presence of such a compton - thick buried agn , as found in a few non - seyfert infrared luminous galaxies , ngc 4945 @xcite , arp 299 @xcite , and ngc 6240 @xcite .",
    "we investigated the nuclear energy source of the infrared luminous galaxy ngc 4418 through near - infrared @xmath0- and @xmath3-band spectroscopy , and millimeter observations at @xmath54 @xmath4 3.4 mm using both a single dish telescope and an interferometric array .",
    "various previous observations have suggested that this galaxy has a deeply buried agn at the center . in the near - infrared spectra",
    ", we detected clear pah emission and co absorption features , suggesting that the observed near - infrared flux comes mostly from star - forming activity .",
    "the magnitude of this detected star - forming activity was measured from the observed pah emission luminosity and was found to account for only 1/50 of the infrared luminosity of this galaxy .",
    "we therefore suggested that the primary energy source of ngc 4418 is deeply buried in dust .    in the near - infrared @xmath0-band spectrum and millimeter interferometric data , large - equivalent - width h@xmath2 emission and a high hcn",
    "/ hco+ luminosity ratio , respectively , were found , both of which are naturally explained by the presence of a strong x - ray emitting source , such as an agn , at the center of ngc 4418 .",
    "the measured hcn to infrared luminosity ratio in ngc 4418 can also be explained by the agn scenario , if the agn is deeply buried in high - density molecular gas and dust .",

    "<S> we present near - infrared and millimeter investigations of the nucleus of the infrared luminous galaxy ngc 4418 , which previous observations suggest possesses a powerful buried agn . </S>",
    "<S> we found the following main results : ( 1 ) the infrared @xmath0-band spectrum shows co absorption features at 2.32.4 @xmath1 m owing to stars and very strong h@xmath2 emission lines . </S>",
    "<S> the luminosity ratios of h@xmath2 emission lines are suggestive of a thermal origin , and the equivalent width of the h@xmath2 10 s(1 ) line is the second largest observed to date in an external galaxy , after the well - studied strong h@xmath2-emitting galaxy ngc 6240 . ( 2 ) the infrared @xmath3-band spectrum shows a clear polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission feature at 3.3 @xmath1 m , which is usually found in star - forming galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the estimated star - formation luminosity from the observed pah emission can account for only a small fraction of the infrared luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) millimeter interferometric observations of the nucleus reveal a high hcn ( 10 ) to hco+ ( 10 ) luminosity ratio of @xmath41.8 , as has been previously found in pure agns . </S>",
    "<S> ( 4 ) the measurements of hcn ( 10 ) luminosity using a single - dish millimeter telescope show that the hcn ( 10 ) to infrared luminosity ratio is slightly larger than the average , but within the scattered range , for other infrared luminous galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> all of these results can be explained by the scenario in which , in addition to energetically - insignificant , weakly - obscured star - formation at the surface of the nucleus , a powerful x - ray emitting agn deeply buried in dust and high density molecular gas is present . </S>"
