    "the observation of heavy excited states of fermions would indicate that these particles are composite rather than elementary . in high - energy @xmath4 collisions ,",
    "such excited states could be produced directly , with masses up to the centre - of - mass energy of the collider .",
    "the recent excited - fermion searches performed by the h1 and zeus experiments have focussed on @xmath0 and @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "excited states of electrons were sought using the following data sets , where the centre - of - mass energies and the approximate integrated luminosities per experiment are given in brackets : 19941997 @xmath5 ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) , 19981999 @xmath8 ( @xmath9 , @xmath3 ) , 19992000 ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) .",
    "the decay channels considered are @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "excited states of neutrinos were sought in the @xmath8 data sets only , since the @xmath1 production cross section for masses beyond @xmath14 in @xmath8 collisions is two orders of magnitude higher than that in @xmath5 .",
    "the decay channels analysed are @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the simulation of @xmath0 and @xmath1 signal events was based on the phenomenological compositeness model by hagiwara et al .",
    "@xcite . for estimating the backgrounds from standard model processes ,",
    "monte carlo samples of nc and cc dis as well as of photoproduction ( php ) and qed - compton events were employed .",
    "among the @xmath0 channels considered , the photonic decay mode , @xmath11 , provides the most striking experimental signature , featuring two isolated electromagnetic clusters with large transverse energies .",
    "typically , no further activity is observed in the detector , except for possible energy deposits by the proton remnant around the forward beampipe . as for the backgrounds , nc dis and qed - compton events contribute with similar magnitudes .",
    "this final state is characterised by a large amount of missing transverse momentum , @xmath18 , due to the neutrino escaping undetected as well as by two hadronic jets from the @xmath19 decay .",
    "the relevant background processes are predominantly multi - jet cc dis and , less pronounced , php . the h1 search required the identification of two jets , whereas zeus employed cuts on global event variables like transverse hadronic energy and hadronic mass .",
    "both experiments applied an electron veto .      due to the hadronic @xmath20 decay ,",
    "this final state features two jets with high transverse energy .",
    "in addition , there is a forward - going high - energy electron .",
    "the only relevant source of background is constituted by nc dis .",
    "again , the two experiments used different approaches in treating the hadronic final state , namely on the basis of jets ( h1 ) and global event variables ( zeus ) , respectively .",
    "the photonic @xmath1 decay gives rise to a particularly rare experimental signature : one isolated , high - energy electromagnetic cluster in the forward direction plus a large amount of @xmath18 .",
    "background arises predominantly from cc dis .",
    "the topologies of the @xmath21 and @xmath22 final states originating from @xmath1 decays are similar to the ones of the corresponding @xmath0 final states .",
    "thus , similar selection criteria as in the corresponding @xmath0 channels were employed by the two experiments .",
    "the numbers of candidate and background events obtained by the searches are summarised in table  [ tab - events ] .",
    "no excess of data events over the expected background has been observed in either of the decay channels analysed .",
    "thus , upper limits at @xmath23 confidence level have been set on the cross section times the branching ratio , @xmath24 , and on the coupling over the compositeness scale , @xmath25 .",
    "the latter limits require as input branching ratios and cross sections from the specific model used .    in fig .",
    "[ fig - lim1 ]  ( a ) , the zeus upper limits on @xmath24 for excited neutrinos are displayed . in fig .",
    "[ fig - lim1 ]  ( b ) , @xmath25 limits for excited electrons are shown . in all limit plots ,",
    "the areas above the curves are excluded .",
    "the h1 curve in fig .",
    "[ fig - lim1 ]  ( b ) has been derived from combining the three decay channels considered , using the conventional assumption @xmath26 for the coupling constants in the hagiwara model ; the zeus curve is from @xmath11 only . in the @xmath1 case ,",
    "@xmath25 limits are usually derived for both assumptions @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the h1 limits for the latter assumption , allowing for photonic @xmath1 decays , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - lim2 ]  ( a ) .",
    "in addition , h1 has derived less model - dependent @xmath25 limits for @xmath1 . at each mass point , the ratio of the coupling constants was varied in the range @xmath28 , the corresponding @xmath25 limit was calculated , and the worst of these limit values was chosen .",
    "the resulting curve is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig - lim2 ]  ( b ) .    in comparison with existing limits by h1 and zeus , the new @xmath24 and @xmath25 limits for @xmath0 and @xmath1",
