    "cold dark matter ( cdm ) models offer an attractive theory for the formation of cosmological structure .",
    "these models , and particularly the @xmath2cdm variant , show impressive self - consistency with many of the most fundamental astrophysical observations : @xmath3 the expansion age of the universe , the primordial element abundance , the two - point correlation function of cluster and galaxies , the local space density and redshift evolution of massive clusters , and the large - scale streaming motions of galaxies in the local universe ( @xmath4 bahcall et al .",
    "1999 ) . nevertheless , it has become clear that this success on large scales ( @xmath3 @xmath5 0.1 - 1 mpc ) does not extend to the level of galaxies ( see , @xmath4 sellwood & kosowsky 2001 for a review ) .",
    "simply stated , cdm models produce an overabundance of power on small scales when normalized to match the observed large - scale power : @xmath4 the models yield dark matter density profiles that are steeper than those observed ( flores & primack 1994 ) , and overpredict the number of dwarf galaxies ( kauffmann , white & guideroni 1993 ) .",
    "we examine the latter issue  the so - called  missing satellite problem \"  by using the globular clusters ( gcs ) associated with a sample of nearby , early - type galaxies to derive the mass distribution of accreted material in these systems .",
    "most recent attempts to explain the missing satellite problem have focussed on the properties of the dark matter itself .",
    "competing models suggest that the dark matter is warm ( coln , avila - reese & valenzuela 2000 ) , decaying ( cen 2001 ) , self - interacting ( dav et al .",
    "2001 ) , repulsive ( goodman 2000 ) or annihilating ( riotto & tkachev 2000 ) .",
    "alternatively , the standard cdm picture may be modified to include a broken scale invariance which suppresses small - scale power ( kamionkowski & liddle 2000 ) .",
    "yet another modification has been proposed by bullock et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , who note that a photo - ionizing background is expected to inhibit the accretion of gas onto low - mass halos after the epoch of reionization . in this latter scenario ,",
    "small - scale power is not suppressed , but _ hidden _ : as a mixed population of disrupted and surviving dark - matter - dominated subhalos .    in what follows ,",
    "we present a simple technique for measuring the mass distribution of disrupted subhalos in low - redshift galaxies .",
    "our technique relies on the gc systems of these galaxies which , by virtue of their extreme age and apparently universal formation efficiency , represent ideal tracers of the original population of low - mass subhalos or , in the terminology used here , protogalactic fragments .",
    "the observational database consists of gc color and metallicity distributions for 28 early - type galaxies presented by kundu & whitmore ( 2001 ) .",
    "although most cosmological evidence appears to favor the notion that the gc systems of large galaxies were assembled hierarchically ( @xmath4 see gnedin , lahav & rees 2001 and references therein ) , kundu & whitmore ( 2001 ) claim that the gc metallicity distributions of their program galaxies are incompatible with such scenarios . in this paper",
    ", we analyze the data of kundu & whitmore ( 2001 ) using a quantitative numerical technique , described in a pair of earlier papers ( ct , marzke & west 1998 ; ct et  al .",
    "2001 ) , which is designed to recover the protogalactic mass spectrum of a galaxy .",
    "the method assumes that the mergers and accretions by which cause galaxies to grow hierarchically induces little or no gas dissipation .",
    "the mass spectra which we derive for the protogalactic fragments in each of these galaxies are indistinguishable from those predicted by cdm models for the population of low - mass dark matter halos , a finding which has obvious implications for the missing satellite problem .",
    "since gcs as a class are composed of coeval stars , the interpretation of their broadband colors is far more straightforward than is the case for galaxies .",
    "moreover , for composite stellar populations with mean ages of a few gyr or more , broadband colors are primarily sensitive to metallicity , not age ( bruzual & charlot 1993 ; worthey 1994 ) .",
    "luckily , the great majority of the gcs in these systems appear to be older than this , according to optical spectroscopy , color - magnitude diagrams , and luminosity function turnover magnitudes for gcs belonging to nearby dwarf elliptical , dwarf spheroidal , spiral and giant elliptical galaxies ( @xmath4 buonanno et al .",

    "2001 ) . indeed ,",
    "evidence from various sources ( see gnedin et  al .",
    "2001 ) points to minimum gc ages in the range @xmath6 gyr , suggesting that , in the currently fashionable @xmath2cdm models , the bulk of gc formation in early - type galaxies had occurred _ before _ @xmath7 .",
    "thus , for the early - type galaxies considered here , we may be confident that the observed gc colors are reliable metallicity indicators .",
    "several recent studies have reported color / metallicity distributions for the gc systems of early - type galaxies based on archival _ hst _ data ( @xmath4 gebhardt & kissler - patig 1999 ; kundu & whitmore 2001 ; larsen et al .",
    "as noted by van den bergh ( 2001 ) , the gc systems of these galaxies exhibit  a bewildering variety of characteristics \" .",
    "this is particularly true of their metallicity distributions which range from obviously multi - modal systems to those with a single ( metal - rich or metal - poor ) peak .",
    "this remarkable variety has led some investigators to suggest that no single recipe for galaxy formation is capable of explaining the full range in gc properties ( @xmath4 harris 2000 ) .",
    "indeed , there is clear supporting evidence for most of the models that seek to explain the formation of gc systems and their host galaxies : @xmath4 the formation of massive clusters in gas - rich mergers ( @xmath4 whitmore & schweizer 1995 ) and the acquisition of gcs through dissipationless accretions ( @xmath4 ibata , gilmore & irwin 1994 ) .",
    "the most immediate question is which  if any  of these processes has dominated the formation of the gc systems which we observe today .    in",
    "what follows , we model these diverse gc metallicity distributions using a simple prescription for hierarchical galaxy formation , described more fully in  3 . in the interests of homogeneity , we limit ourselves to the gc color and metallicity distributions for 28 early - type galaxies presented in kundu & whitmore ( 2001 ) .",
    "their galaxy sample is @xmath8 60% larger than that of larsen et al .",

    "kundu & whitmore sample , ngc  4486b , has been excluded from the analysis since the modeling of its gc metallicity distribution is complicated by the fact that a significant fraction of its initial mass has probably been tidally stripped by ngc  4486 ( @xmath9 , faber 1973 ; kormendy et  al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "kundu & whitmore ( 2001 ) present vi photometry and ( v - i ) colors for gc candidates associated with each of their program galaxies .",
    "the number of gcs , @xmath10 , ranges between 445 for ngc  4649 and 41 for ngc  5845 , with a mean of @xmath11 = 163 . since our goal is to model the detailed shape of the observed gc metallicity distributions ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to gcs with colors measured to a precision of @xmath12(v - i ) @xmath13 0.2 mag or better  roughly the separation between the metal - rich and metal - poor peaks in the most luminous galaxies . with this selection criterion ,",
    "the number of gcs per galaxy ranges from 404 in ngc  4649 to 41 in ngc  5845 , with a mean value of @xmath11 = 144 .",

    "although there is significant scatter about this best - fit relation ( see figure  13 of kissler - patig et  al .",
    "1998 ) , our conclusions are largely insensitive to the exact choice of color - metallicity relation .",
    "the clusters used to establish this relation have metallicities in the range @xmath15 [ fe / h ] @xmath16 dex ( 0.64 @xmath17 v - i @xmath17 1.47 mag ) , an interval which includes the vast majority of clusters considered here .    to simulate the metallicity distribution of a gc system , we require an estimate of the host galaxy s luminosity , and hence distance . in principal",
    ", it is possible to measure individual galaxy distances from the gc data themselves , using the observed turnover of the gc luminosity function ( gclf ) . unfortunately , kundu & whitmore ( 2001 ) were able to obtain reliable two - parameter gclf fits ( @xmath3 turnover magnitude and dispersion ) for just 10 of their 28 galaxies .",
    "as a consequence , distances for their program galaxies were taken primarily from early versions of the surface brightness fluctuation ( sbf ) survey of tonry and collaborators , with extinction estimates from burstein & heiles ( 1984 ) .",
    "recently , the final version of the sbf catalog  based on an improved calibration  has become available ( tonry et al . 2001 ) , so we adopt the latest sbf distances for the sample galaxies .",
    "likewise , improved extinctions for all 28 galaxies have been calculated from the schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 ) dirbe maps . unfortunately , two of the sample galaxies",

    ", no recent distance determination is available , so we follow kundu & whitmore in adopting the prugniel & simien ( 1996 ) distance for this galaxy , but corrected for our new extinction . because of these revised distances and extinctions , the absolute magnitudes of the program galaxies differ from those reported in kundu & whitmore .",
    "the mean magnitude difference is @xmath18 = 0.18@xmath190.08 mag ( mean error ) , in the sense that our magnitudes are brighter than those of kundu & whitmore .",
    "the largest discrepancies are found for ngc  5813 , ngc  7626 and ic  1459 , whose absolute magnitudes have become brighter by @xmath20 0.9 mag .",

    "the remaining columns are discussed in detail below .",
    "we model the observed gc color and metallicity distributions for our program galaxies using a numerical code that has been described in two previous papers .",
    "the first of these papers ( ct et  al . 1998 ) outlined the strategy for simulating gc color and metallicity distributions of galaxies that grow hierarchically via dissipationless mergers , and applied the method to the observed gc metallicity distribution of the giant elliptical galaxy ngc  4472 , one of the objects in the current sample .",
    "a number of refinements to this original code were described in ct et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) , where the model was extended to the gc systems and halo field stars of spiral galaxies ( @xmath3 the milky way and m31 ) . since a complete discussion of the approach may be found in these papers , we give only a brief outline here .",
    "the method uses an empirical , monte - carlo approach to simulate the metallicity distributions of gcs associated with the end - products of multiple dissipationless mergers and accretions , as expected in hierarchical models in which the _ bulk _ of gc ( and star ) formation takes place in distinct protogalactic fragments and occurs _",
    "prior _ to the epoch of galaxy assembly . using a monte - carlo approach , it is possible to simulate the gc metallicity distribution of an individual galaxy by specifying three model ingredients : ( 1 ) an assumed form for the mass or luminosity function of the protogalactic fragments which agglomerate into the final galaxy ; ( 2 ) a relation between the mass or luminosity of the protogalactic fragment and the mean metallicity of its gc system ; and ( 3 ) the number of gcs per unit protogalactic fragment mass or luminosity .",
    "each of these ingredients is determined empirically from observations of the gc systems of low - redshift galaxies .",
    "this empirical approach has the important practical advantage that it avoids the uncertainties involved in modeling directly the cycle of gas cooling , star formation and feedback in these halos ( issues which , ultimately , must be addressed in any complete theory of gc formation ) . as discussed in ct et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) , the merging probability of protogalactic fragments is assumed to be independent of mass . as figure  1 of bullock",
    "( 2001 ) shows for the specific case of the milky way , this assumption appears remarkably sound for protogalactic fragments with circular velocities of less than @xmath23 km  s@xmath24 , corresponding to a mass of @xmath25 a few times @xmath26 .",
    "the luminosity function of protogalactic fragments is parameterized as a schechter function , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a characteristic luminosity and @xmath29 is an exponent which governs the relative number of faint and bright systems ( schechter 1976 ) .",
    "note that the luminosity in equation  ( 2 ) refers to the _",
    "present day _",
    "luminosity of surviving protogalactic fragments ( @xmath3 isolated galaxies of low- and intermediate- luminosity ; larson 1988 ) . over the luminosity range considered here",
    ", we assume a constant @xmath30-band mass - to - light ratio of @xmath31 at @xmath32 , which is roughly appropriate for the low- and intermediate - luminosity galaxies used below to define the relation between mean gc metallicity and host galaxy luminosity ( mateo 1998 ) .",
    "we take the low - luminosity cutoff in equation  ( 2 ) to be @xmath33 , or @xmath34 .",
    "these limits correspond to the fornax dsph galaxy ( the faintest galaxy known to contain its own gc system ) but the precise choice has little effect on the calculated gc metallicity distributions for slopes shallower than @xmath35 . at the bright end",
    ", we adopt a constant value of @xmath36 for all simulations ( ct et  al .",
    "2000 ) , while @xmath29 is a free parameter to be determined on a galaxy - by - galaxy basis through a comparison of the observed and simulated gc metallicity distributions .",
    "note that , for masses less than @xmath37 , the protogalactic mass function has a nearly power - law form , @xmath38 which is also characteristic of the extended press - schechter mass functions used in semi - analytic models .",
    "our decision to treat the change in the initial luminosity and mass functions as a change in @xmath29 alone is clearly an approximation , as @xmath28 and @xmath39 must have unavoidably increased in the presence of mergers and accretions .",
    "although our simulations have no time resolution , cosmological n - body simulations demonstrate that the change in @xmath39 should have only a modest effect on the final gc metallicity distribution : figure  12 of pearce et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) suggests the that change in the high - end cutoff of the mass function between @xmath40 and @xmath41 is about a factor of four , corresponding to a maximum shift in @xmath42v - i@xmath43 color of 0.08  mag for the highest mass protogalactic fragments .",
    "the relation between gc metallicity and luminosity / mass of the host protogalactic fragment has been discussed extensively in ct et al .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the mean gc metallicity plotted against the luminosity ( or mass ) of nine dwarf elliptical ( de ) and dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies ( circles ) , with data taken directly from that paper .",
    "note that gc metallicities for these galaxies have been converted into ( v - i ) colors according to equation  ( 1 ) .",
    "triangles indicate the metal - rich gc systems of two well - studied spiral galaxies : the milky way and m31 . in both cases ,",
    "the luminosities and masses refer to their _ bulges _ ; that is to say , we assign the metal - rich gcs in these galaxies to their bulge components , and not their disks ( minniti 1995 ; ct 1999 ) .",
    "our estimate for the relation between the mean gc color and the absolute magnitude of the host protogalactic fragment is @xmath44 which is indicated by the dashed line in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "this  zero - age \"",
    "relation gives the dependence of mean gc color on the luminosity , or mass , of the progenitor protogalactic fragment , _ as it would appear today _",
    ", if the subsequent evolution has been mostly passive . in the simulations , the mean color / metallicity of gcs belonging to each protogalactic fragment is determined using equation  ( 4 ) , with an assumed 1@xmath12 scatter of 0.03  mag ( 0.1 dex ) .",
    "the _ internal _ dispersion in color for each protogalactic fragment is also approximated as a gaussian , with dispersion 0.09  mag ( 0.29 dex ) based on the findings of ct et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "finally , we adopt a constant gc specific frequency for all protogalactic fragments  @xmath45 at the present time  and neglect possible variations in @xmath46 at the low- and high - mass ends of the galaxy distribution ( see  6 ) . in the notation of mclaughlin ( 1999 )",
    ", this specific frequency corresponds to a gc formation efficiency of @xmath47 by mass .",
    "this is consistent with the value of @xmath48 advocated by mclaughlin ( 1999 ) based on observations of about one hundred early - type galaxies .",
    "the 20% uncertainty in our adopted values of @xmath46 and @xmath49 reflects the observed scatter about their means , and has been included explicitly in our monte - carlo simulations .      before proceeding , we present a descriptive example of how the gc system of a galaxy that grows hierarchically through dissipationless mergers will evolve in the color - magnitude plane .",
    "consider a protogalactic fragment , a , with absolute magnitude @xmath50  mag and mass @xmath51 which falls on the zero - age color - magnitude relation ( @xmath3 the dashed line in figure  [ fig1 ] ) . according to equation  ( 4 ) ,",
    "the unimodal gc system associated with this protogalactic fragment will have @xmath42v - i@xmath43 = 1.14  mag .",
    "first , suppose that this fragment merges with an identical fragment , producing an end - product , c1 , with @xmath52  mag and a gc system having a single peak at @xmath42v - i@xmath43 = 1.14  mag .",
    "alternatively , fragment a could accrete a population of 100 protogalactic fragments , b , each of which has @xmath53  mag , and @xmath42v - i@xmath43 = 0.865  mag .",
    "but , by virtue of equation ( 5 ) and our assumed constant mass - to - light ratio , fragment a contributes the same number of gcs as the 100 smaller fragments combined .",
    "thus , the gc systems of the final galaxy , c2 , will have two distinct components ( containing equal numbers of metal - rich and metal - poor gcs ) , and a mean color of @xmath42v - i@xmath54 1.00  mag",
    ". a third possible end - product , c3 , is also shown in figure  [ fig1 ] . in this case , the galaxy was formed entirely through the agglomeration of ( 200 ) fragments of type b , so that the final gc system is unimodal , but with a metal - poor peak at @xmath42v - i@xmath43 = 0.865  mag .    the point of this simple exercise to emphasize that , once the  zero - age \" color - metallicity is fixed , it is possible  through a suitable adjustment of the mass spectrum of the protogalactic fragments  to reproduce the gc systems of _ any _ galaxy whose gc system falls within the dotted region shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "this simple recipe for galaxy formation combines dissipationless mergers , which serve to move the galaxy to the right of the initial color - magnitude relation , with a dissipative , monolithic collapse scenario for the constituent protogalactic fragments .",
    "our goal is to use the observed gc metallicity distribution for a specific galaxy and solve an inverse problem to determine the mass spectrum of protogalactic fragments which best matches the observed metallicity distribution .      with equations  ( 2 ) and ( 4 ) specified , it is a trivial matter to calculate analytically the metallicity distribution of a gc system which arises from dissipationless mergers and accretions . in practice ,",
    "such an approach is thwarted by the highly stochastic nature of hierarchical galaxy formation ( @xmath4 lacey & cole 1993 ) , particularly at the high - mass end of the protogalactic mass spectrum .",
    "fortunately , this stochasticity can be used to reconstruct merger histories for individual galaxies since the fossil record of the largest protogalactic fragments is ussually preserved in the final gc metallicity distribution .    to do so , we generate , for each galaxy in our sample , 50 simulated gc systems at each point over a 10@xmath5510 grid in ( @xmath56 , @xmath29 ) where @xmath56 is the ratio between the mass of the largest protogalactic fragment and the final mass of the galaxy , @xmath57 and @xmath29 is the slope of the protogalactic mass function .",

    "on the basis of the same gc data analyzed here , kundu & whitmore ( 2001 ) claim that hierarchical models for galaxy formation are unviable . as figures  [ fig3]-[fig10 ]",
    "demonstrate , this conclusion is not supported by their data .",
    "kundu & whitmore ( 2001 ) made no attempt to simulate the gc color distributions expected in hierarchical formation scenarios , despite the fact that the implementation of such algorithms has been described in detail previously ( @xmath4 ct et al .",
    "2000 ; harris et  al .",
    "instead , they advocate a qualitative scenario in which gc formation occurs in multiple star formation episodes driven by mergers of gas - rich disk galaxies , although such models are curently not amenable to observational tests .",
    "they further note that some of the low - luminosity galaxies in their sample ( @xmath4 ngc  1439 , ngc  3377 and ngc  4660 ) are likely to have bimodal gc metallicity distributions and claim that this observation poses  a serious problem \" for the hierarchical model .",
    "this claim is surprising since ct et al .",
    "( 2001 ) showed that hierarchical models were able to reproduce the bimodal gc metallicity distribution of the galactic spheroid , which is several times fainter than ngc  1439 , ngc  1427 and ngc  3377 .",
    "moreover , all of the low - luminosity galaxies having bimodal gc metallicity distributions fall within the region in figure  [ fig1 ] that is expected to be occupied by galaxies which form hierarchically (  3.2 ) .",
    "as figures  [ fig3]-[fig9 ] attest , the observed diversity in the gc metallicity distributions _ and _ the bimodal nature of some low - luminosity ellipticals could arise naturally within the context of a simple hierarchical model .",
    "kundu & whitmore ( 2001 ) also state that the success of the hierarchical model  is critically dependent on the second - order nature of [ the metallicity - luminosity relation for ] the systems being cannibalized \" . however , this claim too is incorrect since the model distributions presented in figures  [ fig3]-[fig9 ] are derived from a _ linear _ metallicity - luminosity relation ( see  3.1 ) , not the second - order relation adopted by ct et al .",
    "( 1998 ) on these basis of preliminary data .",
    "while it is clearly important to further refine the metallicity luminosity relation for the gc systems of low- and intermediate - luminosity galaxies , the model described here is quite general in nature , and our basic conclusions are unlikely to be changed by minor modifications to the metallicity - luminosity relation .      having shown that hierarchical growth through dissipationless mergers and accretions offers a viable explanation for the diverse metallicity distributions of gc systems in early - type galaxies , we now examine properties of protogalactic fragments from which the galaxies may have been assembled .",
    "figures  [ fig11]-[fig17 ] show protogalactic luminosity and mass functions for each galaxy , based on the simulation which matches the observed gc metallicity distribution .",
    "the shaded histogram in each panel shows the best estimate for the distribution of protogalactic fragments , while the dashed curve indicates the parent schechter function from which the simulation was drawn . for all galaxies ,",
    "the corresponding gc metallicity distributions are indicated by the dashed curves in figures  [ fig3]-[fig9 ] .",
    "a striking feature of the protogalactic luminosity and mass functions shown in figures  [ fig11]-[fig17 ] is their steep slope . from table",
    "[ tab1 ] , the average power - law exponent for the protogalactic luminosity and mass functions is @xmath74 ( mean error ) , with a standard deviation of @xmath12(@xmath29 ) = 0.13 .",
    "this value is consistent with previous findings for ngc  4472 ( @xmath75 ; ct et  al .",
    "1998 ) , the milky way ( @xmath76 ; ct et al .",
    "2000 ) and m31 ( @xmath75 ; ct et al .",
    "2000 ) . in the context of hierarchical formation models ,",
    "it is the apparent universality of this exponent which , when coupled with the fixed low - mass cutoff of the protogalactic luminosity function , conspires to produce the population of metal - poor gcs with [ fe / h ]  @xmath77dex that are present in virtually every large galaxy studied to date ( @xmath4 ashman & bird 1993 ; brodie , larsen & kissler - patig 2000 ) . as the same time",
    ", the observed diversity of gc metallicity distributions arises from the stochastic fluctuations about this  universal \" protogalactic mass spectrum , particularly at the high - mass end . by virtue of their large mass ,",
    "these fragments contribute the bulk of the metal - rich gcs associated with the final galaxy .    from table",
    "[ tab1 ] , we see that there is a fairly wide range in the properties of the most massive protogalactic fragments . on average ,",
    "the most massive fragment contributes a fraction @xmath78 ( mean error ) of the galaxy s final mass , with a standard deviation of @xmath12(@xmath56 ) = 0.14 . for some galaxies , such as ngc 4406 , the contribution of the largest fragment amounts to no more @xmath8 10% of the final mass , while in ngc 4458 , as much as 70% of the final mass may have arisen in the dissipational collapse of the largest protogalactic fragment . for ngc  4472",
    ", we find a best - fit value of @xmath63 ( mean error ) , which compares favorably with the value of @xmath79 estimated by ct et al .",
    "( 1998 ) using ground - based observations of its gc system carried out in a different filter system ( @xmath3 @xmath80 photometry from geisler , lee & kim 1996 ) , and using an alternative color - magnitude relation .",
    "recent studies have concluded that approximately 50% of bright , early - type galaxies show evidence for bimodal color distributions ( gebhardt & kissler - patig 1999 ; larsen et  al .",
    "2001 ; kundu & whitmore 2001 ) , so it is of interest to ask how often the simulations yield a metallicity distribution that is bimodal at a statistically significant level .",
    "unfortunately , the answer to this question depends rather sensitively on the properties of each dataset used to assess the level of bimodality . to understand why this is so , consider figure  [ fig18 ] , which shows the metallicity distribution for a representative program galaxy , ngc 5322 .",
    "for the purposes of illustration , the solid curve shows the ( normalized ) metallicity distribution corresponding to the protogalactic mass function plotted in the upper panel of figure  [ fig12 ] , where the intrinsic dispersion in metallicity for each protogalactic fragment is taken to be 0.01 dex . as discussed in  3.1 and in ct",
    "et al . ( 2000 ) , actual fragments are likely to have had intrinsic dispersions much larger than this , but this extreme example serves to illustrate the complex nature of the underlying metallicity distribution , and demonstrates the dangers of interpreting multi - modal metallicity distributions as _ prima facie _ evidence for multiple bursts of gc formation .",
    "the remaining curves show this same ( renormalized ) distribution after smoothing with gaussians having dispersions of 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.3 and 0.4 dex ( intended to represent the combined effects of an intrinsic metallicity dispersion _ and _ observational errors ) .",
    "this last distribution is , like the observed distribution , ostensibly unimodal in nature ( kundu & whitmore 2001 ) , but this is mainly a consequence of the intrinsic metallicity dispersion ( @xmath8  0.3 dex ) for the protogalactic fragments , and the @xmath8  0.3 dex dispersion associated with metallicity measurements derived from ( v - i ) colors having a precision of roughly 0.1 mag .",
    "thus , establishing the frequency of bimodality depends rather sensitively on the precision of metallicity measurements ( and on other factors including the total luminosity of the final galaxy and its detailed merger tree ) .",
    "as mentioned in  1 , one of the most troubling problems facing cdm models on small scales is the so - called  missing satellite \" problem . simply stated , the number of low - mass dark halos predicted by cdm models exceeds the observed number of dwarf galaxies by factors of tens , or even hundreds ( @xmath4 kauffmann , white & guiderdoni et  al .",
    "1993 ; klypin et  al .",
    "1999 ; moore et al .",
    "is it possible to explain the underabundance of dwarf galaxies in the local universe , and at the same time retain the basic framework of cdm models ?",
    "figure  [ fig19 ] shows the ensemble spectrum of protogalactic fragments in our sample : @xmath3 summed over all 28 galaxies ( filled circles ) . as with the individual galaxies ,",
    "the composite mass function is found to follow a power - law behavior , @xmath0 , with exponent @xmath1 . while this mass function is much steeper than the local galaxy luminosity function ( @xmath81 , pritchet & van den bergh 1999 ; folkes et  al .",
    "1999 ; blanton et  al .",
    "2001 ) , it is nevertheless in remarkable agreement with the mass spectrum of dark matter halos predicted by cdm models of structure formation ; the dotted line in figure  [ fig19 ] shows the analytical approximation , @xmath82 , for the mass spectrum of dark matter halos in the n - body simulations of moore et  al .",
    "_ in short , we find evidence for a disrupted population of dwarf - sized protogalactic fragments in each of our program objects , whose numbers and masses closely resemble those of the predicted population of  missing \" satellite galaxies . _    this finding may have important consequences for the various models which have been advanced as possible solutions to the missing satellite problem .",
    "such a disrupted population is , in fact , predicted by models which account for the missing satellites by suppressed gas accretion in low - mass halos after the epoch of reionization due the presence of a strong photo - ionizing background ( @xmath4 rees 1986 ; thoul & weinberg 1996 ; bullock , kravtsov & weinberg 2000 ) . a disrupted component of this sort is also expected in models which seek to explain the missing satellite problem through self - interacting cdm ( @xmath4 spergel & steinhardt 2000 ; dav et al .",
    "by contrast , a disrupted component is not expected in models which explain the underabundance of dwarf galaxies through an _ ab initio _ reduction in small scale power ( @xmath4 kamionkowski & liddle 2000 ) or by suppressing the formation of low - mass halos via warm dark matter ( @xmath4 coln , avila - reese & valenzuela 2000 ; sommer - larsen & dolgov 2001 ) .",
    "thus , these models appear to be inconsistent with the observed metallicity distributions of gcs in galaxies at @xmath83 since the same low - mass halos whose formation is suppressed in these scenarios are actually _ required _ to explain the gc metallicity distributions of luminous galaxies in hierarchical cosmologies .",
    "we have described a technique for simulating the metallicity distributions of gcs belonging to galaxies that grow hierarchically through dissipationless mergers and accretions . applying the model to the gc systems of 28 early - type galaxies for which high quality _ hst",
    "_ data are available demonstrates such a mechanism is capable of explaining quantitatively the observed diversity in extragalactic gc systems .",
    "thus , claims that the metallicity distributions of gcs in early - type galaxies are inconsistent with a hierarchical origin ( kundu & whitmore 2001 ) are unsubstantiated .",
    "protogalactic mass spectra for the sample of early - type galaxies considered here reveal a striking similarity : they appear to follow a power - law distribution in mass , with @xmath84 .",
    "this mass spectrum is indistinguishable from the mass spectrum of dark matter halos predicted by cdm models , and thus has an important implication for the missing satellite problem ( klypin et  al .",
    "1999 ; moore et  al .",
    "1999 ) . specifically , we find evidence from the gc systems of the galaxies examined here for a disrupted population of dwarf - sized protogalactic fragments whose numbers and masses closely resemble those of the predicted population of missing satellite galaxies",
    ".    if the basic scenario outlined here is correct ( @xmath3 the early formation of gcs in low- and intermediate - mass halos after a rapid period of mass - dependent chemical enrichment , followed by the agglomeration of these halos into the main body of the galaxy ) , then there may be some interesting observational consequences of this picture .",
    "for instance , if most of the low - mass dark matter halos predicted by cdm models have indeed been rendered undetectable as a result of disruption and the suppression of gas accretion after reionization , as suggested by bullock et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) , then some fraction of the original halo population may survive as  dark galaxies \" ( see , @xmath9 , klypin et  al .",
    "1999 and references therein ) .",
    "precise estimates for the redshift of gc formation are not yet available , but current evidence seems to favor formation at @xmath85 ( see gnedin et  al .",
    "2001 ) , close to the expected edge of the epoch of reionization ( djorgovski et  al . 2001",
    "; becker et  al .",
    "2001 ; barkana 2001 ) .",
    "this raises the possibility that some of these putative  dark galaxies \" , which have experienced little or no star formation , might nevertheless have managed to form gcs .",
    "interestingly , there is some evidence that the number of gcs per unit host galaxy luminosity increases toward fainter systems , at least among de , n galaxies ( durrell et  al . 1996 ; miller et  al .",
    "searches of extragalactic gc systems for compact , dynamically - bound groupings of gcs  presumably metal - poor in nature and not associated with an identifiable satellite galaxy  might prove interesting .",

    "<S> contrary to the claims of kundu & whitmore , we find that the observed metallicity distributions are in close agreement with the predictions of such hierarchical formation models . </S>",
    "<S> the mass spectrum of protogalactic fragments for the galaxies in our sample has a power - law behavior , @xmath0 , with an index of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this spectrum is indistinguishable from the mass spectrum of dark matter halos predicted by cold dark matter models for structure formation . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that these protogalactic fragments  the likely sites of globular cluster formation in the early universe  are the disrupted remains of the  missing \" satellite galaxies predicted by cold dark matter models . </S>",
    "<S> our findings suggest that the solution to the missing satellite problem is through the suppression of gas accretion in low - mass halos after reionization , or via self - interacting dark matter , and argue against models with suppressed small - scale power or warm dark matter . </S>"
