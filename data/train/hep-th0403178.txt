    "any solution of the yang - baxter equation that is crossing - symmetric and unitary becomes a candidate for the factorizable s - matrix of a quantum field theory in 2 space - time dimensions@xcite .",
    "though infinite classes of rational and trigonometric solutions related to quantum algebras are known to describe an underlying quantum field theory , there are no a priori principles that ensure that every s - matrix necessarily has such an interpretation . in this regard",
    "the elliptic solutions provide a striking example ; though these solutions have been known for over 25 years , it has remained unknown whether they have a field theory description . in this paper",
    "a field theory will be proposed for zamolodchikov s elliptic s - matrix@xcite , and also for the mussardo and penati s scalar s - matrix@xcite .",
    "an elliptic solution to the yang - baxter equation was first found by baxter in connection with the 8 vertex model of classical lattice statistical mechanics@xcite .",
    "it was later shown that it could be made crossing symmetric and unitary@xcite .",
    "we emphasize that the answer to the question of whether there is a field theory description underlying this s - matrix is not contained in the physics of the 8 vertex model , nor equivalently the fully anisotropic xyz spin chain .",
    "there is no a priori relation between the solution of the yang - baxter equation that encodes the boltzman weights and the s - matrix of the fundamental excitations .",
    "furthermore the xyz spin chain has a non - relativistic dispersion relation , whereas the s - matrix is relativistic .",
    "certain relativistic continuum limits of the xyz spin chain exist that lead to the sine - gordon , or massive thirring model@xcite , but the resulting s - matrix is not elliptic but trigonometric .",
    "the new ingredient we use to relate the elliptic s - matrices to a field theory is the limit - cycle in the renormalization group ( rg ) flow of the field theory@xcite .",
    "indeed , it was suggested by zamolodchikov@xcite that the field theory , if it exists , should be characterized by an rg limit - cycle .",
    "his argument was based on the periodic properties of the s - matrix as a function of energy ( at high energy ) and the early arguments of wilson showing that such periodicities are naturally a consequence of a cyclic rg@xcite .",
    "( see section ii . )",
    "an outline of this article is as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe some physical signatures of an rg limit cycle in a general , model - independent way , extending the discussion in @xcite to include the role of resonance poles .",
    "an infinite sequence of resonance poles leading to masses with special scaling relations is another characteristic signature of an rg limit cycle , termed `` russian doll '' scaling in @xcite .",
    "there is a clear distinction between massive and massless theories .",
    "we argue that a massive theory can only correspond to a limit cycle in the ultra - violet , whereas a massless theory can support a limit cycle in the infra - red _ and _ ultra - violet , in fact on all scales . in section iii",
    "we define the quantum field theory models as fully anisotropic @xmath0 current - current interactions in 2d .",
    "the bosonized form of the action involves both a scalar field and its dual .",
    "the fermionized version continues to exhibit spin - charge separation and has an explicit @xmath1 symmetry .    in section",
    "iv we show that integration of the 1-loop beta functions leads to couplings expressed in terms of elliptic functions , and are hence periodic as a function of scale with the period a function of rg invariant combinations of the couplings . by analyzing the @xmath3 invariant limit we classify 4 possible models . in section v the @xmath1 invariant elliptic solutions of the yang - baxter equation are reviewed .",
    "these elliptic solutions are related to the field theory in sections vi and vii . in the @xmath3 invariant limit",
    "these theories go over to the usual sine - gordon model@xcite or to the cyclic sine - gordon model studied in @xcite . that the elliptic s - matrices can have two different @xmath3 invariant limits relies on the fact that they have two different trigonometric limits at complementary elliptic moduli .",
    "the relation between lagrangian and s - matrix parameters is found by matching the period of the rg with the periodic s - matrix properties .",
    "the models also all have the expected russian doll spectrum of resonances .",
    "there is another regime that is an elliptic deformation of the sinh - gordon model and this is described in section viii , where it is proposed that the s - matrix is the scalar one considered by mussardo - penati@xcite . finally in section",
    "ix we consider the massless theories . in all cases",
    "the @xmath3 invariant limit serves as a non - trivial check .",
    "in this section we describe in a general , model - independent fashion some of the signatures of an rg limit cycle , extending the discussion in @xcite .    before proceeding ,",
    "we mention that naively , limit cycle behavior in a unitary theory appears to be inconsistent with zamolodchikov s c - theorem : @xmath4 is a function of the running coupling constants , so if the couplings are periodic as a function of scale , so is @xmath4 .",
    "this leaves us with a puzzle since our model is a hermitian perturbation of a unitary conformal field theory .",
    "the s - matrix is also unitary in a strict sense .",
    "this issue was discussed at length in @xcite for a limiting case of the models here . though further investigation is needed regarding this issue , we offer the following hint as to what may be going wrong . instead of zamolodchikov s c - function which is related to a two - point function of stress - energy tensors ,",
    "let us consider the c - function @xmath5 that determines the finite size effects ; this is the function that was studied in @xcite . for the quantum field on a cylinder of circumference @xmath6 , the one - point function of the trace of the stress - energy tensor",
    "is a derivative of @xmath5 : t_^_r = - it trivially follows that if @xmath7 is positive , then @xmath5 decreases with increasing @xmath6 . as we now argue , the positivity of @xmath7 can generally be violated in theories with no ultra - violet fixed point and marginal perturbations , which is precisely the situation for our models .",
    "suppose a quantum field theory is described by a conformally invariant action @xmath8 perturbed by operators @xmath9 : [ s00 ] s = s_cft + _ a   g_a ^a where @xmath10 are positive couplings .",
    "let @xmath11 be the beta function for @xmath10 and @xmath12 the scaling dimension of @xmath9 .",
    "then the beta functions ( for increasing length scale ) to lowest order are [ betass ] _ a = ( 2-_a ) g_a + o(g^2 )",
    "the main point is that the trace of the stress - energy tensor recieves quantum corrections , and since it must be zero at a fixed point where the beta functions are zero , one must have : [ tbeta ] t_^= _ a _ a ( g ) ^a the above formula is well known@xcite and is easily verified to lowest order in conformal perturbation theory .",
    "consider first a theory that can be formulated as a perturbation of an ultra - violet fixed point by relevant operators , which implies @xmath13 .",
    "then the beta - functions are positive to lowest order .",
    "furthermore , for relevant perturbations , because of the anomalous dimensions of the couplings , there is often no higher order corrections to the beta functions since higher powers of @xmath10 do not have the right dimension .",
    "so in this situation , @xmath7 is generally positive and the c - theorem holds .",
    "the above arguments clearly point to the way in which the c - theorem can be violated .",
    "if the @xmath9 are marginal , @xmath14 , and the beta functions start at @xmath15 .",
    "there are no general constraints on the sign of the beta function .",
    "for instance , suppose the theory has no ultra - violet fixed point so that the couplings increase toward the ultra - violet rather than go to zero .",
    "the latter implies the beta function must be negative .",
    "this in turn implies the stress - energy tensor need not be positive and the c - theorem is violated . for the models below",
    ", one can check that the beta functions are not always positive .",
    "let us return to the properties of theories with rg limit cycles . generally speaking , cyclic behavior in the rg flow can in principle exist at all scales , or can be approached asymptotically in the ultra - violet ( uv ) or infra - red ( ir ) , the latter being uv or ir limit - cycle behavior .",
    "once the flow is in the cyclic regime , the couplings are periodic [ ii.1 ] g(l + ) = g(l ) where @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the length scale . above",
    ", the period @xmath18 is fixed and model - dependent .",
    "it is well - known that the rg leads to scaling relations for the correlation functions , generally referred to as callan - symanzik equations@xcite .",
    "let @xmath19 be an n - point correlation function : [ cs.1 ] g(x_1 , x_2 , .. , x_n ; g , l ) = ( x_1 ) ( x_n ) the above correlation function is computed using the renormalized action and is thus finite and depends on the rg scale @xmath20 .",
    "we have not explicitly displayed dependence on a mass parameter since for our models the action contains no such parameter : the physical mass @xmath21 of particles is generated dynamically and is a function of @xmath22 .",
    "the callan - symanzik equation expresses the independence of @xmath19 on the arbitrary scale @xmath20 : [ cs.2 ] @xmath23 g(x ; g , l ) = 0 where @xmath24 is the anomalous dimension of @xmath25 .",
    "let @xmath26 denote the naive ( engineering ) dimension of @xmath25 .",
    "then since @xmath19 has dimension @xmath27 , the above equation leads to the scaling equation : [ cs.3 ] @xmath28 g ( e^s x ; g , l ) = 0 the above equation can be explicitly integrated : [ cs.4 ] g ( e^s x ; g , l ) = e^-s n d _   @xmath29   g(x ; g(s ) , l ) where @xmath30 flows according to the beta - function : @xmath31 with @xmath32 .",
    "letting now @xmath33 , one finds [ cs.5 ] g(e^x ; g , l ) = e^- n d _ g ( x ; g , l ) therefore the function @xmath34 is a periodic function of @xmath35 with period @xmath18 .",
    "the s - matrix is related to the fourier transform of the green s functions to momentum space , and thus also obeys scaling relations .",
    "let @xmath36 denote the 2-particle to 2-particle s - matrix .",
    "for an integrable quantum field theory in 2 space - time dimensions , @xmath36 only depends on the kinematic variable @xmath37 where @xmath38 are the energy - momentum vectors of the incoming particles ( for an integrable theory , the incoming and outgoing momenta are the same ) .",
    "since the s - matrix is a dimensionless quantity one obtains : [ ii.2 ] s ( e^-s , g ) = s ( , g(s ) ) if a theory is in a cyclic regime , when @xmath33 the above equation implies a periodicity in energy : [ ii.3 ] s ( e^- , g ) = s ( , g )      let us now consider a uv limit cycle .",
    "we specialize to 2d kinematics , and first assume the spectrum of particles is massive , such that the energy - momentum can be parameterized in terms of a rapidity @xmath39 : [ ii.4 ] e = m ,   p = m above , @xmath21 is the physical mass of the particles , and as explained above , is an ( unknown ) function of @xmath22 .",
    "the center of mass energy is [ ii.5 ] ^2 = 2 m^2 ( 1 + ) ,  = _ 1 - _ 2  ( massive   case ) the uv limit corresponds to high energies where @xmath40 is large and @xmath41 .",
    "the relation eq .",
    "( [ ii.3 ] ) then implies a periodicity in rapidity : [ ii.6 ] s(- 2 ) = s ( ) the above periodicity is the primary signature of a uv limit cycle for a massive theory",
    ".    there can exist another signature in the uv that has analogies with properties of other models with ir limit cycles@xcite .",
    "namely , if @xmath42 is the spectrum of eigenvalues of the hamiltonian for a system of size @xmath17 , then [ iii ] \\",
    "{ e_n , g(s ) , e^s l ) } = \\ { e_n , g , l } , when @xmath43 equals the period of one cycle @xmath18 , the above equation shows that the energy spectrum at fixed @xmath44 should reveal a discrete self - similarity as a function of @xmath45 .",
    "the manner in which the spectrum can reproduce itself after one rg cycle is dependent on the existence of an infinite number of eigenstates with the `` russian doll '' scaling behavior : [ iiii ] e_n+1 e^e_n ,  n=0,1 , ..  for  n   large  ( uv ) in each cycle these eigenstates reshuffle themselves such that the @xmath46th state plays the same role as the @xmath47th state of the previous cycle .",
    "since we are considering a uv limit cycle , the above property holds at _ high _ energies @xmath48 .    for an integrable quantum field theory in infinite volume ,",
    "the above property can be manifested as an infinite tower of resonances with masses that obey special scaling relations .",
    "namely , one expects resonances of mass @xmath49 , @xmath50 , where [ dolls ] m_n+1 e^   m_n ,  for   n   large these resonances correspond to poles in the s - matrix .",
