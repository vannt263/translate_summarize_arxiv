    "recent progress in hall experiment with graphene reveals many new features in longitudinal and transversal resistivity in hall configurations characteristic for fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) both in suspended graphene scrapings @xcite , and in graphene samples on crystalline substrate of boron nitride @xcite .",
    "the different structure of landau levels ( lls ) in graphene in comparison to the conventional semiconductor 2deg is the source of distinct scheme for integer quantum hall effect ( iqhe ) in graphene referred as to relativistic its version @xcite .",
    "the berry phase induced shift for chiral carriers in graphene together with the four - fold spin - valley degeneration of lls result in @xmath0 series for fillings at which iqhe plateaus occur in subsequent centers of lls for the case of monolayer graphene .",
    "when @xmath1 spin - valley symmetry is broken by larger magnetic field , the new features for iqhe appear corresponding to removing of ll subbands degeneration @xcite . in bilayer graphene the extra degeneration of @xmath2 and @xmath3 lls shifts plateau positions to ends of lls also four - fold degenerated in this case except for the eight - fold degenerated lll .",
    "simultaneously , still more and more features at fractional fillings of lls are observed related to fqhe , revealing also a specific its character mostly connected with the different structure of subbands of lls and particle - hole symmetry due to meeting of the conductivity and valence bands in dirac points .",
    "the new filling fractions are observed in six first subbands of lls with @xmath2 and @xmath3 in monolayer graphene @xcite not repeating the hierarchy of fqhe in conventional 2deg and not allowing for explanation upon standard composite fermion model .",
    "especially interesting is an observation of unusual even denominator fillings for fqhe in bilayer graphene including the most pronounced feature at @xmath4 @xcite , taking into account possibility for control of non - abelian anyons excited from the @xmath5 state as previously studied for @xmath6 in traditional semiconductor 2deg @xcite and important for potential application in topological quantum information processing .    in the present letter",
    "we analyze the details of the hierarchy for fractional fillings linked to strongly correlated multiparticle states in graphene using the topological commensurability approach developed earlier for the ordinary 2deg hall systems @xcite . in this way",
    "we explain the structure of fractional fillings of ll subbands and demonstrate its evolution with growing number of the ll and the number of its subband .",
    "this approach gives the hierarchy of fqhe and of other features , including paired states and hall metal , in agreement with the available experimental data for monolayer and bilayer graphene .",
    "in particular the explanation of the even denominator filling ratios for bilayer graphene , with the fqhe state at @xmath4 , has been achieved in a direct manner upon the applied commensurability topological method .",
    "the concept of commensurability of classical cyclotron trajectories with interparticle spacing in 2d systems is born in relation to the braid group approach to multiparticle systems in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "if @xmath7 identical particles are located on the manifold @xmath8 , the collective behavior of such system can be assigned by the statistics phase shift if one considers position exchange of particle pair @xcite .",
    "this quantum feature is associated with the one dimensional unitary representation ( 1dur ) of the full braid group related to the system .",
    "the full braid group is the first homotopy group of the multiparticle configuration space , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the @xmath7-fold normal product of the manifold @xmath8 , @xmath11 is the diagonal point set in this product ( when coordinates of two or more particles coincide , subtracted in order to assure conservation of the number of particles ) , @xmath12 is the permutation group of @xmath7 elements @xcite .",
    "the quotient structure of the configuration space @xmath13 is related with the indistinguishability of quantum identical particles  the property essential for the quantum statistics determination reason .",
    "apart of this quantum prerequisite the full braid group @xmath14 is the classical topological object collecting all classes of nonhomotopic trajectory loops in the configuration space @xmath15 , where points which differ only by enumeration of particles are unified .",
    "any details of the dynamics of @xmath7 particle system caused by the interaction and resulting in special shapes of trajectories are not important here .",
    "only topology of trajectories decides whether one trajectory loop can be continuously transformed into another one or not . in the latter case",
    "such topologically nonequivalent trajectories fall to the distinct classes of the full braid group .",
    "thus , the full braid group does not reflect the dynamics details but rather identifies the topology restrictions imposed on the multiparticle system associated to some global features of the system including the manifold @xmath8 type . as the loops from @xmath14 describe exchanges of particles ( due to identification of positions of all particles which differ by the enumeration only ) the full braid group contains information on quantum statistics of particles , though classical particles do not have any such statistics .",
    "it was proved that the one dimensional unitary representations ( 1durs ) of the full braid group serve as determinants of the quantum statistics of quantum particles related to the original classical ones @xcite .",
    "therefore , if particle classical positions defined by the coordinates of the multiparticle wave function @xmath16 ( @xmath17 is the coordinate of @xmath18-th particle on the manifold @xmath8 , i.e. , the classical position of the @xmath18-th particle on @xmath8 ) are changing along a selected loop from the @xmath14 , then this wave function acquires the phase shift @xmath19 given by the 1dur of this particular braid @xcite . in this way",
    "the statistics of quantum particles can be identified .",
    "for the same classical particles the quantumly different particles can be defined as assigned by distinct 1durs of the related full braid group . for three dimensional ( or of higher dimension ) manifolds",
    "@xmath8 the full braid group is simply the permutation group @xmath12 , with only two different 1durs @xcite , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the generator of @xmath12 , i.e. , the elementary braid describing exchange of @xmath18-th and @xmath22-th particles , whereas other particles are left in their positions .",
    "these two 1durs correspond to bosons and fermions , respectively . for two - dimensional manifolds @xmath8",
    "the braid groups differ considerably from the permutation group .",
    "unlike the permutation group , for @xmath23 , @xmath14 is an infinite group with the 1durs @xcite , @xmath24 corresponding to so - called anyons ( including bosons for @xmath25 and fermions for @xmath26 ) .",
    "anyons are quantum particles , different than bosons or fermions , which can appear in 2d multiparticle systems , e.g. , for particles located on the @xmath27 plane or on the locally 2d manifold , like a sphere ( but not on torus @xcite , for which 1durs of related full braid group do not exist ) .    nevertheless , there are also other peculiarities of 2d manifold topology , which were not accounted for in the manner as described above .",
    "the special feature of planar multiparticle systems manifests itself in the presence of the perpendicular magnetic field strong enough that the classical cyclotron radius is shorter in comparison to the interparticle separation on the plane . because the classical trajectories of free charged particles are defined by cyclotron orbits at the presence of a magnetic field , thus exchanges of neighboring particles in 2d topology are possible only if the size of the cyclotron orbits fits to the separation between particles , as is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figg1 ] .",
    "let us emphasize that the average separation between particles on the plane is rigidly fixed by the coulomb interaction between particles preventing approaching one particle onto another one in the uniformly distributed @xmath7 particles .",
    "the fulfillment of the commensurability between the cyclotron radius and the interparticle spacing is required for the definition of the generators @xmath21 of the full braid group , where @xmath21 describes exchange of @xmath18-th and @xmath22-th particles .",
    "if the cyclotron orbit is incommensurate with the separation between particles on the plane , then the classical trajectories describing @xmath21 elements of the full braid group are impossible and this braid group can not be defined for such strong magnetic field .",
    "it means that the quantum statistics can not be defined in this case and any correlated multiparticle quantum state can not be organized .",
    "this situation happens at fractional filling of the lowest landau level ( lll ) .",
    "for magnetic fields larger that this one which corresponds to the completely filled lll , the classical cyclotron orbits are too short to match neighboring particles and the definition of the generators of the full braid group is precluded .",
    "nevertheless , at some magic fractional filling ratios of the lll the correlated states are experimentally observed and refereed as to fractional quantum hall effect @xcite . in means",
    "that possibility of particle exchanges is recovered somehow . in the framework of the composite fermion ( cf )",
    "approach @xcite the enlargement of cyclotron orbit size is achieved by screening of the external magnetic field by auxiliary field flux quanta attached to particles .",
    "this artificial model allows for identification of the main line of fractional fillings for fqhe by mapping of the fractional state onto integer quantum hall states in resultant magnetic field reduced by the average field of fluxes pinned to cfs .",
    "this model does not explain neither the origin of auxiliary field fluxes nor the mechanism of creation of composite particles .",
    "the manifestation of fqhe can be explain , however , also in the braid group terms @xcite .",
    "though the generators @xmath21 of the full braid group can not be defined when the cyclotron orbits are shorter than interparticle separation , there exist other braids which in 2d fit to interparticle separations .",
    "this exceptional property of planar multiparticle systems possess multilooped cyclotron braids , i.e. , @xmath28 where @xmath29odd integer , and for e.g. , @xmath30 , @xmath31 describes the braid for exchange of @xmath18-th and @xmath22-th particles with an additional loop . exclusively in 2d the multilooped cyclotron orbits have larger size which can fit to interparticle separation at the magic filling fractions of the lll , the same ones at which fqhe is observed .",
    "the reason of the enhancement of the size of planar multilooped orbits is linked with constant surface field of 2d orbits despite its multilooped character ( in opposition to 3d case when each additional loop adds also a surface portion spanned by this loop ) .",
    "when the total external field flux is passing through the 2d multilooped orbit it must be shared between all loops and their sizes grow .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figg2 ] .    in fig .",
    "[ figg2 ] ( left ) the scheme of the cyclotron orbit at magnetic field @xmath32 is shown as accommodated to the quantum of the magnetic field flux , i.e. , @xmath33 .",
    "this serves here as the definition of the cyclotron orbit @xmath34 because this @xmath34 fits to the interparticle separation , @xmath35 , @xmath36the sample area , @xmath7the number of particles , in the case of the completely filled lll .",
    "if only single - loop orbits are available , then at , for instance , 3-times larger field , @xmath37 , the cyclotron orbit accommodated again to the flux quantum is too short in comparison to the interparticle separation @xmath38 ( which fitted to the @xmath32 field orbits but not to @xmath37 orbits ) .",
    "this is illustrated in the central panel of fig .",
    "[ figg2 ] .",
    "nevertheless , if tree - loop orbits are considered , then in flat geometry of 2d space , the external flux @xmath39 must be shared between three loops with the same surface @xmath34 ( i.e. , @xmath40 for each loop ) .",
    "thus , each loop accommodated to the flux quantum @xmath41 has the orbit with the surface @xmath34 and gives the contribution @xmath40 to the flux , resulting in the total flux @xmath39 per particle , as needed  this is schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figg2 ] ( right ) .",
    "the size of @xmath34 in the right panel is equal to @xmath34 in the left panel , which means that the three - loop orbits fit to the interparticle separation equaled to @xmath34 .    as the braid group generators must be defined by the half of the cyclotron orbit ( cf .",
    "[ grafenrys5 ] ) thus the braid with one additional loop corresponds to the cyclotron orbits with three loops ",
    "such a generator has the form @xmath42 and the braid group generated by @xmath43 , @xmath44 is the subgroup of the original full braid group .",
    "this subgroup is called the cyclotron braid subgroup and its 1durs define statistics of 2d charged particles at strong magnetic field corresponding to fractional filling @xmath45 of the lll giving rise to the explanation of the laughlin statistics for fqhe at this fractional filling .",
    "the generalization to more loops attached to the braid generator one by one , results in double increase of loop number in multilooped cyclotron orbits and thereby in fractions @xmath46 , @xmath47 .",
    "this approach successfully reproduces the hierarchy of the experimentally observed filling fraction corresponding to fqhe in the lll and in the higher lls for 2deg in conventional semiconductors @xcite .    if @xmath48 , i.e. , when cyclotron orbits are larger that interparticle separation , ( as in the right panel in fig .",
    "[ figg1 ] ) , some special commensurability circumstances important for braid group definition also occur .",
    "for the filling fractions when @xmath49 ; @xmath50 , the cyclotron orbits fit to every @xmath51-th particle separation ( @xmath52 ) , which also allows for the definition of the generators @xmath21 in the form of ordinary singlelooped braids , similarly as happens for the completely filled higher lls .",
    "the related statistics is the same as for iqhe though at some fractional fillings of higher lls as is demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite in good correspondence with experimental observations up to the three first lls for 2deg in conventional semiconductors @xcite .",
    "this could happen only in such ll subbbands where the condition @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) could be fulfilled .",
    "in the conventional semiconductor hall systems it may happen only for @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the number enumerating lls . simultaneously , for @xmath55 too short cyclotron orbits can be encountered only close to subbands borders , because in the higher lls the cyclotron singlelooped orbits are larger as accommodated to higher kinetic energy .",
    "this pushes fqhe(multiloop ) features in higher lls toward the edges of subbands in lls with @xmath55 , whereas in central regions of these subbbands the new fractional features occur related with the singleooped cyclotron orbits and thus with iqhe - type of correlations but at fractional filling ratios .",
    "these correlated states are referred as to fqhe(singleloop ) .",
    "the quantization of the transverse resistance @xmath56 related to these fractional filling ratios of higher lls @xmath57 is as for fqhe @xmath58 , but the correlations of laughlin type are with the exponent @xmath59 displaying singlelooped braid exchanges like in iqhe .",
    "the number of these new fractional filling ratios grows as @xmath60 with the ll number .",
    "in graphene one deals with the relativistic version of lls @xcite . this is due to specific band structure in this material being a gapless semiconductor with points @xmath61 and @xmath62 on the border of the hexagonal brillouin zone where the valence and conduction bands meet together @xcite .",
    "thus the low energy particle - hole excitations can be described by the effective dirac hamiltonian corresponding to cone - shape of both bands close to the meeting points .",
    "the quantization due presence of the magnetic field has the form of degenerated lls , though with spectrum not equidistant as for ordinary 2deg but enumerated by @xmath63 , @xmath54 is the number of the ll @xcite .",
    "this form of the selfenergies results from the linear in momentum hamiltonian close to @xmath61 and @xmath62 points , whereas the degeneration of each ll subband is the same as for 2deg and equals to @xmath64 .",
    "the number of subbbands per each ll ( each @xmath54 ) is here 4 .",
    "this corresponds to the ordinary zeeman spin - splitting and to the so called valley splitting ( expressed often in terms of a pseudospin ) due to doublet of inequivalent @xmath61 points mixed with two sublattices for @xmath65 atoms in crystal net of graphene @xcite .",
    "taking into account that the zeeman splitting in graphene is small @xcite and the valley splitting depending on the external magnetic field is small as well , the 4-fold approximate spin - valley additional degeneration is employed to determine the filling fractions for relativistic iqhe in graphene , in the following form @xmath66 in pretty good correspondence with the experimental observations @xcite .",
    "the remarkable difference between this filling rate formula and that one for the ordinary 2deg ( with factor 2 instead of 4 , due to only approximate spin degeneration ) is the presence of the overall shift by the factor 2 resulting from @xmath67 in the above formula .",
    "this shift is due to the so - called berry phase manifesting in the lll for graphene and resulting in the sharing of states from the lll between particles and holes from the conduction and valence band , respectively , at the zero energy level . due to this feature",
    "the bottom of the lll is shifted by 2 ( in terms of the filling factor ) upward if counting only negatively charged carriers and oppositely ",
    "downward for positive holes .",
    "the corresponding filling rates for holes from the valence band are negative mirror refection of those for electrons from the conduction band .",
    "note that changing between particles and holes can be easily achieved in graphene by the shift of the fermi level around the dirac point by application of a lateral voltage .",
    "the berry phase contribution is referred sometimes as to the additional @xmath68 phase shift due to the chirality induced by the valley pseudospin when one adiabatically traverses with a selected particle a closed loop ( e.g. , along the semiclassical cyclotron loop ) when the momentum made the @xmath69 convolution .",
    "similar analysis of the lls can be done for the bilayer graphene @xcite . due to off - diagonal interlayer",
    "hopping term the local hamiltonian attains again the quadratic form with respect to the momentum .",
    "thus the ll spectrum in bilayer graphene resembles that one for the ordinary 2deg with four subbands for each level except for the lll which is eight - fold degenerated .",
    "this extra degeneration of the lll arose from the action of the square of an annihilation operator on oscillator states with @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xcite . due to the sharing of the lll between particles and holes , the bottom for uniformly charged carriers is located in the center of the 8-fold quasi - degenerated lll .",
    "this property is associated again with the berry phase shift for chiral particles , though in the case of bilayer graphene it gives additional @xmath69 phase shift .",
    "therefore , steps of the relativistic iqhe are located in bilayer graphene again at integer filling rates of the subsequent lls whereas for monolayer graphene were located at half - fillings of the lls @xcite .      for magnetic field",
    "strong enough that @xmath70 one deals with completely filled valence band hole states of the lll and with the fractional filled subsequent particle states from the conduction band subband @xmath71 ( @xmath72 indicates the valley pseudospin orientation and @xmath73 indicates orientation of the ordinary spin ) . the degeneration of each subband is @xmath74 and we have less than @xmath75 of electrons , @xmath76 for fractional fillings .",
    "the cyclotron orbits in the lll must be accommodated to the bare kinetic energy @xmath77 where @xmath78 .",
    "the cyclotron orbits have the same size for all particles due to the flat band condition quenching the kinetic energy competition and resulting in the same averaged velocity and the same cyclotron orbit size for all particles at a perpendicular magnetic field presence ( though quantumly , a velocity is not well defined since its coordinates do not commute ) .",
    "the cyclotron orbits restrict the topology of all trajectories uniformly in 2d , thus restrict the braid group structure despite of particularities of interaction and other fields including the crystal field .",
    "therefore for graphene the cyclotron orbit structure is governed by ordinary ( the same as for 2deg ) landau levels restrictions even though a specific band structure with dirac points being the result of the crystal field highly modifies lls but not in terms of the bare kinetic energy .",
    "the particularities of graphene quantum dynamics induced by the electric - type interaction are included in the ordinary part of the feynman path integral , whereas the additional summation over topologically nonequivalent trajectory classes concerns the braid group structure the same as for 2deg upon the magnetic field .",
    "the difference between the conventional 2deg systems and graphene will be related in this regard with distinct number of ll subbands in graphene comparing to the conventional semiconductor 2deg and in the barry phase induced shift of fillings in the lll .",
    "thus , the cyclotron orbit size in the subband @xmath71 equals to , @xmath79 , where @xmath36 is the sample surface .",
    "as this orbit size is lower than the interparticle separation @xmath80 ( as @xmath76 ) , the multilooped braid structure is necessary . from the commensurability condition",
    "@xmath81 one finds @xmath82 , ( @xmath83 to protect the braid structure ) . for holes in this subband one can expect the symmetric filling ratios @xmath84 .",
    "similarly as for the ordinary 2deg one can generalize this simple series by assumption that the last loop of the multilooped cyclotron orbit can be commensurate with the interparticle separation as for some other filling ratio expressed by @xmath85 , whereas the former loops take away an integer number of flux quanta . in this way one can obtain the hierarchy of fillings for fqhe in this subband of the lll , @xmath86 , where @xmath87 or equals to other fractional filling factor and minus in the denominators indicates possibility of the eight - figure orientation of the last loop with respect to the antecedent one .",
    "the hall metal states can be characterized by the limit @xmath88 in the above formula ( i.e. , for zeroth flux taken away by the last loop as for ordinary fermions without the magnetic field , which was the case in the hall metal archetype for @xmath89 in the conventional 2deg ) , which gives the hierarchy for the hall metal states , @xmath90 . to account for the berry phase anomaly in graphene",
    "the overall shift of @xmath91 by @xmath92 can be performed , but we use here the net filling fractions .    for the completely filled subband @xmath71 , i.e. , for @xmath93 , one arrives at iqhe . for lower magnetic field ( or larger number of electrons ) , when three first subband of the lll are filled and in the last subband of lll , the cyclotron orbit size @xmath94 is still lower than the interparticle separation @xmath95 ( because @xmath96 ) .",
    "thus multilooped structure is repeated from the previous subband .",
    "this results with the same fqhe hierarchy as for antecedent subband , only shifted ahead by 1 .",
    "for the completely filled lll ( i.e , for completely filled all its subbands ) one deals with iqhe according to its main - line @xmath97 .    similarly one can consider fillings of the second ll with @xmath3 .",
    "this level also has four subbands , but in this level the bare kinetic energy is equaled to @xmath98 and the related cyclotron orbit size @xmath99 . for @xmath100",
    "$ ] we deal with graduate filling of @xmath101 subband .",
    "cyclotron orbits of size @xmath102 are comparing here to interparticle separation scale @xmath103 . only for small number of electrons in this subband one deals with the multilooped structure ( corresponding to the inequality @xmath104 ) ,",
    "when @xmath105 , which gives main series for fqhe(multiloop ) in this subband , @xmath106 .",
    "similarly as before the complete related hierarchy reads , @xmath107 , with the hall metal hierarchy in the limit @xmath108 .",
    "these series are located closer to the subband edges , whereas in the center of this subband the other commensurability conditions are possible .",
    "when @xmath109 and @xmath110 we get @xmath111 , respectively , corresponding to singlelooped cyclotron orbits similar as for iqhe . thus , for @xmath112 one deals with fqhe(singleloop)the new hall feature manifesting itself only in higher lls , where cyclotron orbits may be larger than the interparticle separation . at the special case @xmath113",
    "one can arrive at @xmath6 with the paired particles ( pairing does not change the cyclotron radius but twice diminishes the carrier number to @xmath114 ) .",
    "the following subband are filled with electrons upon the similar scheme . for the subband @xmath115 the cyclotron size is @xmath116 , whereas the interparticle distances are measured with the plaque @xmath117 , where @xmath118 .",
    "the commensurability condition @xmath119 results in the main series for fqhe(multiloop ) , @xmath120 , which can be developed to the full hierarchy similarly as described above .",
    "the condition @xmath121 with @xmath110 results in fractions with singleloop correlations of fqhe(singleloop)-type for @xmath122 and iqhe for @xmath123 , correspondingly , whereas a paired state can be realized at @xmath124",
    ".      the special topology of the bilayer 2deg structure creates opportunity to verify the braid group based concept of the commensurability of cyclotron orbits size with the interparticle spacing in planar system of interacting particles .",
    "the interaction preserves particles do not approach one to another one closer than particle separation resulting from the planar density .",
    "only when the cyclotron orbits fit accurately to this spacing the mutual classical exchange of neighboring particles is possible at presence of the perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "this is caused by the fact that the trajectories of particles are governed by the cyclotron orbital action of the magnetic field and despite of the interaction particularities the geometry of free particle cyclotron orbits allow for topological classification of possible or not possible trajectories creating the fundamental @xmath125 group of the configuration space for the system of n particles on the plane , i.e. , the full braid group for the plane @xcite . in 2d",
    "all cyclotron orbits are planar and in the case of uniformly distributed particles with the same velocities exposed to the perpendicular magnetic field they either admit topologically exchanges of neighboring particles or not depending on the commensurability of the cyclotron orbits with the interparticle separation .",
    "if the planar size of the cyclotron orbits @xmath34 equals to the plane fraction per single particle @xmath126 ( where @xmath36 is the surface field of the sample and @xmath7 is the number of particles ) , the mutual exchanges of particles are possible and the ordinary full braid group @xmath14 can be defined . otherwise , when @xmath127 , the exchanges of particles are impossible along ordinary cyclotron trajectories , as they are too short to merge neighbors on the plane .",
    "when @xmath48 the interchanges of 2d particles are also impossible along cyclotron trajectories , because such an exchange do not allow for conservation of uniform particle distribution with the constant interparticle spacing .",
    "these three distinct commensurability situations were depicted in fig .",
    "[ figg1 ] .",
    "topological conditioning of interparticle exchanges in the uniformly distributed planar systems of charged particles plays the fundamental role in discrimination of trajectories from the full braid group which are not admitted at the presence of the magnetic field as do not merge particles .",
    "miss mash between size of cyclotron orbits and interparticle spacing precludes the definition of the full braid group generators @xmath21 corresponding to the interchange of @xmath18-th and @xmath22-th particles ( upon a selected certain enumeration of particles , arbitrary in general due to particle indistinguishability ) .",
    "when the braid group can not be defined the collective state can not be created as the statistics of particles can not be determined . in order to establish the statistics of quantum particles ,",

[ figg1 ] ) , the ordinary generators @xmath21 can not be defined .",
    "if one removes from the full braid group all impossible singlelooped - related trajectories corresponding to generators of this group , which can not be defined as the cyclotron orbits are too small to match particles , one can observe that the remaining braids with additional loops can match particles on 2d separated larger than the singlelooped cyclotron orbit reaches .",
    "these braids are related to multilooped cyclotron orbits with @xmath133 loops , i.e. , when @xmath134 , with @xmath133 odd integer @xcite .",

    "two sheets of the graphene plane lie in close distance with the hopping constant allowing changing of electron positions between the planes .",

    "are in charge also for the bilayer graphene , with a single distinction with respect to the monolayer case .",
    "the doublelooped cyclotron orbits may have in bilayer graphene the same size as the singlelooped orbit .",
    "this follows from the fact that the second loop can be located in the opposite sheet of graphene than the first one and the external field passing through such doublelooped orbit is twice larger than the flux passing through the singlelooped orbit .",
    "each loop has in this case the separate own surface in contrary to the multilooped cyclotron orbit located on the purely 2d plane which forced each loop to take away only some fraction of the total flux because all these loops share the same surface in 2d .",
    "taking into account that in the bilayer system loops of the multilooped orbit may be located partly in both 2d sheets , the contribution of the one loop must be avoided whereas the remaining loops must share the same flux as passing through a singlelooped orbit , independently how loops are distributed between two sheets .",
    "thus , one can write out the commensurability condition in the bilayer graphene for the case of too short singlelooped cyclotron orbits in the following form ( for concreteness in the subband @xmath71 of the lll  the first particle - type subband of the lll ) , @xmath139 where , @xmath7 is the total number of particles in both graphene sheets , @xmath75 is the degeneration counted for both sheets together , @xmath36 is the surface of the sample ( the surface of the single sheet ) @xmath133 is an odd integer to assure that the half of the cyclotron orbit defines the braid .",
    "the factor @xmath140 in l.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ 21 ] ) is caused by the fact that in enlarging of the effective cyclotron orbits participate only orbits from the ideally 2d sheet of bilayer graphene ( no matter in which are located doubling loops ) with the exception of a single orbit which is located in opposite sheet to the first one .",
    "this sole loop contributes to the total flux with the additional flux quantum due to its own surface and this loop must be omitted .",
    "the next orbits must duplicate the former ones ( in fact two ) without rising the surface and no matter in which sheet are they located , because in both they will duplicate loops already present there .",

    "let us emphasize that for such multilooped orbits the total number of loops still is @xmath133thus the generators of the corresponding cyclotron subgroup are of the form @xmath141 , resulting in the laughlin correlations with the @xmath133 exponent for the jastrow polynomial .",
    "but due to the distinct commensurability of orbits with interparticle separation ( [ 21 ] ) the related filling fraction are @xmath142 in the first particle - type subband of the lll , i.e. , the subband @xmath143 .",
