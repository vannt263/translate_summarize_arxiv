    "low - energy ( below the superconducting energy gap ) electron transport through contacts between a superconductor and a normal metal can be understood in terms of andreev reflection.@xcite in this process , an incident electron from the normal side can enter the superconductor by pairing with another electron with the opposite spin , leaving a reflected hole in the normal metal .",
    "the phase - coherent nature of this process results in superconducting correlations being induced in the normal - metal side , referred to as the proximity effect .",
    "the important feature of andreev reflection is that , with singlet superconductors , it involves both spin bands in the normal metal .",
    "therefore , the above simple picture has to be modified when the normal metal is replaced by a ferromagnet with two different fermi surfaces for the two spins , resulting in new and interesting physical phenomena . in recent years , interplay between superconductivity and ferromagnetism has attracted considerable theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite attention  both out of fundamental scientific interest and in view of the possibility of novel applications and devices .",
    "one important consequence of the spin splitting between the two bands in the ferromagnet is that the phase coherence between the particle - hole pair in the clean ( dirty ) limit is destroyed over a characteristic distance of @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) , where @xmath3 is the fermi velocity , @xmath4 the diffusion constant , and @xmath5 an effective exchange energy which describes the spin splitting . since this distance is typically very short ( of the order of atomic distances )",
    ", the superconducting correlations induced to the ferromagnetic material are expected to be confined to the immediate vicinity of the separating interface .",
    "this raises the question whether , for strong ferromagnets , a mechanism of a different type takes over and dominates the physics of superconductor / ferromagnet ( s / f ) contacts .",
    "one such mechanism , recently under active investigation , is the inducement of spin - triplet correlations : namely , the exchange field only affects correlations of singlet type , _",
    "i.e _ between particles and holes in opposite spin bands . in fact",
    ", equal - spin triplet correlations are expected to be created by proximity to a ferromagnet due to the breaking of spin - rotational symmetry .",
    "the desire to formulate a theory capable of understanding the detailed nature and the conditions for the formation of these correlations and the corresponding anomalous proximity effect has given the initial motivation for this work .",
    "problems related to superconducting proximity effect with spin - dependent interfacial scattering are of spatially inhomogeneous nature and , as such , they can only be studied with specialized theoretical tools .",
    "such a tool is provided by the quasiclassical theory of superconductivity.@xcite this theory is applicable for weakly perturbed superconductors ( characteristic length scale of perturbations much larger than fermi wave length and characteristic frequencies much less than fermi energy ) and can be used in both equilibrium and nonequilibrium situations .",
    "it describes quasiparticles with momenta on the fermi surface moving along straight classical trajectories , the direction of which is given by the corresponding fermi velocity .",
    "a ferromagnetic metal has different fermi surfaces and , correspondingly , different sets of trajectories for the two spin orientations . in this case",
    ", the quasiclassical theory can be used to describe two limiting cases : _",
    "i ) _ weak ferromagnetism , where the energy splitting of the two fermi surfaces and the associated deviation of the fermi velocities is so small that the two spin trajectories with the same momentum direction are fully coherent , and _",
    "ii ) _ strong ferromagnetism , where the splitting is so large that the coherence is lost completely . while the former limiting case has been exhaustively studied in the literature , the latter has only recently received attention.@xcite here we present a theoretical study of the latter possibility . even in the absence of conventional andreev reflection processes ( which would require coherence between particles and holes in opposite spin bands ) , interesting and nontrivial physics emerges due to spin - active interfacial scattering .",
    "additional motivation has been provided by the growing interest in a new class of materials , half - metallic ferromagnets.@xcite in these materials , one spin band is metallic and the other one insulating ( 100% polarized ferromagnet ) .",
    "since a half metal has a fermi surface only for one of the two spin orientations , it is clear that the traditional description for weak ferromagnets is inapplicable , and other methods must be employed .    in sec .",
    "ii , we outline the central equations of the quasiclassical theory of superconductivity . compared with the full microscopic theory ,",
    "the quasiclassical theory offers considerable simplifications when treating spatially inhomogeneous states by reducing the content of ( unnecessary ) information carried by the green s functions .",
    "however , this leads to nontrivial boundary conditions which have to be formulated at interfaces separating different metals that connect the solutions of the two sides .",
    "such conditions have been derived for nonmagnetic interfaces by zaitsev,@xcite and for magnetic interfaces by millis _",
    "et al._@xcite after a short description of this work in sec .",
    "iii , we formulate an alternative but equivalent set of boundary conditions , where the transmission through an interface is parameterized by a hopping amplitude that contains the information of various processes contributing to particle transfer .",
    "this approach enables the formulation of boundary conditions in a simple and appealing form .",
    "the equivalence to existing methods is demonstrated in sec .",
    "iv . as explained in sec .",
    "v , the advantages of the @xmath0-matrix formulation are especially evident in studying interfaces that separate two materials with a different structure of the green s functions and/or a different number of trajectories , such as in the case of a superconductor / strong ferromagnet interface . finally , in sec .",
    "vi , we apply our theory to study the current through a point contact separating a singlet superconductor from a strong ferromagnet .",
    "the quasiclassical theory of superconductivity @xcite is formulated in terms of quasiclassical green s functions ( or propagators ) @xmath6 that depend on the spatial coordinate @xmath7 and time @xmath0 and describe quasiparticles with energy @xmath8 ( measured from the chemical potential ) and the momentum direction on the fermi surface @xmath9 moving along classical trajectories with direction given by the fermi velocity @xmath10.@xcite the quasiclassical green s functions are 2@xmath112 matrices in keldysh space ( denoted by a `` check '' accent ) ,    @xmath12    with three nonzero elements ( retarded @xmath13 , advanced @xmath14 , and keldysh @xmath15 ) . in describing superconductivity , these elements in turn",

    "indeed , the elements in the lower half of the matrix are related to the ones in the upper half through the conjugation symmetry , _ e.g. _",
    "@xmath17    the quasiclassical green s functions satisfy the eilenberger transport equation    @xmath18_{\\otimes } + i { { \\bf v}_f}({\\hat{\\bf p } } ) \\cdot \\nabla_{\\bf r }   \\check g=0 .",
    "\\label{eilen}\\ ] ]    generally speaking , the self energy @xmath19 includes molecular fields , the superconducting order parameter @xmath20 , impurity scattering , and external fields .",
    "the noncommutative product @xmath21 combines matrix multiplication with a convolution over the internal variables , and @xmath22 is a pauli matrix in particle - hole space .",
    "the quasiclassical green s functions also satisfy a normalization condition    @xmath23    in addition to ( [ eilen ] ) and ( [ normalize ] ) , self - consistency equations for different parts of the self - energy have to be provided ; _",
    "e.g. _ for the ( weak - coupling ) order parameter the condition reads    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the strength of the pairing interaction , @xmath26 denotes averaging over the fermi surface , and @xmath27 is the particle - hole off - diagonal part of the quasiclassical keldysh green s function .",
    "the cut - off energy @xmath28 is to be eliminated in favor of the transition temperature in the usual manner .",
    "when the quasiclassical green s function has been determined , physical quantities of interest can be calculated ; _",
    "e.g. _ the expression for the current density adopts the form    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the electron charge and @xmath31 is the density of states on the fermi surface .",
    "however , to form a complete theory for studying heterostructures , the above equations must still be supplemented with the boundary conditions connecting the solutions at the separating interfaces .",
    "we introduce these conditions in the following chapter .",
    "interfaces represent strong perturbations on an atomic length scale and , therefore , fall out of the applicability range of quasiclassical theory .",
    "however , as was shown in the pioneering work of zaitsev , @xcite interfaces can be brought within the quasiclassical theory by means of effective boundary conditions that connect trajectories related through interface scattering processes . later these conditions were generalized for an arbitrary magnetically active interface , _",
    "i.e. _ one that scatters quasiparticles differently depending on their spin orientation.@xcite the latter case is relevant for studying interfaces with spin - polarized materials such as ferromagnets .",
    "the procedure for the derivation of the boundary conditions begins by isolating a region of quasiclassical size @xmath32 around the interface located at the origin of the perpendicular coordinate @xmath33 ( @xmath34 much larger than the atomic - size range of the strong interface potential but much smaller than the superconducting coherence length @xmath35 ) . in the half spaces",
    "@xmath36 , the solutions for quasiclassical green s functions can be found by standard methods described in the previous chapter .",
    "the solutions for the left ( @xmath37 ) and right ( @xmath38 ) sides are then matched via a scattering matrix    @xmath39    the form of which is determined by the detailed microscopic structure of the interface region and on the quasiclassical level has to be treated as a phenomenological parameter of the theory .",
    "the crucial simplifying observation is that , since the strong ( of the order of the fermi energy ) interface potential dominates the hamiltonian in the interface region , the scattering matrix ( [ sm ] ) corresponds to that of the _ normal state _ , _",
    "i.e. _ does not contain particle - hole mixing . also , it has no keldysh space structure .",
    "the boundary conditions were derived for a smooth ( on the scale of @xmath35 ) interface , assuming the conservation of momentum @xmath40 parallel to the interface . in the following ,",
    "all momentum - dependent quantities should be understood as having the same @xmath41 , unless explicitly stated . in terms of quasiclassical green s functions",
    "they adopt the form @xcite    @xmath42    with @xmath43 and @xmath44 , where @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) is a unit vector along the momentum direction with the perpendicular component directed towards ( away from ) the interface .",
    "the boundary condition consists of four coupled nonlinear equations for the incoming and outgoing matrix propagators on both sides of the interface .",
    "solving this equation system and dealing with the possibility of arriving at unphysical solutions is evidently not a simple task .",
    "progress towards a more convenient form of boundary conditions has been made by eschrig ( nonmagnetic interfaces ) @xcite and fogelstrm ( magnetic interfaces).@xcite they employed the powerful riccati parameterization method which allows for a considerably simpler representation of boundary conditions in terms of the riccati amplitudes.@xcite however , the conditions in ref .   were only derived for the equilibrium ( retarded and advanced ) propagators .",
    "furthermore , even in equilibrium situations they can not be used in the published form in the case when the two sides of the interface have a different number of trajectories ( _ i.e. _ when matrices @xmath47 and @xmath48 are not invertable ) .",
    "this situation arises in the context of half - metallic materials , where trajectories exist only for one of the spin orientations .      due to the abovementioned difficulties we proceed in an alternative but equivalent route.@xcite this method requires solving for the auxiliary quasiclassical propagators @xmath49 and @xmath50 for an _ impenetrable _ interface .",
    "they are to be calculated with the self - energies @xmath51 determined with the full propagator , and using the simple perfectly - reflecting boundary condition    @xmath52    where @xmath53 .",
    "they also satisfy the normalization condition , @xmath54 .",
    "the impenetrable interface is characterized by two surface scattering matrices , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "particle conservation requires them to be unitary , @xmath57 .",
    "the transmission processes for an interface with arbitrary transparency can be taken into account with a @xmath0-matrix formulation .",
    "the transfer matrices are determined with effective hopping amplitudes @xmath58 and @xmath59 by the following equations :    @xmath60    with @xmath61 due to particle conservation .",
    "the corresponding @xmath0 matrices for outgoing trajectories are related to the ones for incoming trajectories through the relation    @xmath62    the @xmath0 matrix describes the modifications of the decoupled quasiclassical propagators due to virtual hopping processes to the opposite side . finally , the boundary condition can be expressed in terms of @xmath63 and @xmath64 to read    @xmath65    in the @xmath0-matrix description , the phenomenological parameters containing the microscopic information of the interface are the surface scattering matrices and the hopping amplitudes .",
    "the particle - hole structures of the surface scattering matrix and the hopping amplitude are connected through    @xmath66    to ensure the conservation of current .",
    "in the general case    @xmath67    in this formulation , the boundary problem effectively reduces to calculating the auxiliary green s functions for perfectly reflecting interfaces .",
    "numerically this is an extremely simple task , _",
    "e.g. _ , employing the procedure of riccati parameterization . afterwards the boundary green s functions for the partially transmitting interface can be obtained directly from eqs .",
    "( 13 ) , since solving for the necessary @xmath0 matrices ( 11 ) only involves a 4@xmath114 matrix inversion .",
    "when contrasted with solving the group of equations ( 9 ) , the @xmath0-matrix approach manifests its usefulness .",
    "the underlying perturbative nature of the @xmath0-matrix approach might arise suspicions concerning its applicability when the interface in question has high transparency .",
    "the boundary conditions ( 13 ) are , however , valid for arbitrary transmission and , in fact , completely equivalent to the corresponding scattering - matrix description ( 9 ) .",
    "the connection between the two approaches is established by the following identification of the full scattering matrix in terms of the surface scattering matrices and hopping amplitudes :    @xmath68    where we have defined    @xmath69    the identity ( [ scatt ] ) serves as a precise definition of the auxiliary matrices @xmath70 and @xmath71 in terms of the physical parameters of the full scattering matrix . using ( [ tilde ] ) , the particle ( @xmath72 ) and hole ( @xmath73 ) parts of ( [ scatt ] ) can be seen to be related by    @xmath74    in particular , if the interface scattering matrix is spin - inactive , eqs .",

    "we show that the solution of ( 13 ) in the appropriate limit also solve zaitsev s boundary conditions for arbitrary transmission of the interface , and in both equilibrium and nonequilibrium situations . on the other hand , in the case of diffusive conductors",
    "the boundary conditions of the @xmath0-matrix approach are equivalent to the ones derived by nazarov.@xcite      the boundary conditions of zaitsev read ( we suppress the symbol @xmath21 and unit matrices for clarity ) @xcite    @xmath75&= & -i\\pi d\\check g_s^{- } \\check g_s^{+ } , \\label{z2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath76 ( @xmath4 ) is the reflection ( transmission ) coefficient , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 , with @xmath80 . in the corresponding limiting case the surface scattering matrices @xmath81 are unit matrices ,",

    "as already mentioned , the quasiclassical theory is formulated in terms of quasiparticles travelling along classical trajectories .",
    "smooth interfaces between different materials introduce coupling between incoming and outgoing trajectories with the same momentum parallel to the interface .",
    "a ferromagnet has a different fermi surface ( or , equivalently , set of trajectories ) for each of the two possible spin orientations .",
    "consequently , two different limiting cases that allow a quasiclassical description naturally emerge ( see fig .",
    "[ interface ] ) . in the first case",
    "the exchange energy splitting of the two fermi surfaces is small enough that the quasiparticle wave packets on the two trajectories corresponding to the same parallel momentum but different spins overlap and , therefore , the two trajectories remain fully coherent in the ferromagnetic region ( fig .",
    "[ interface]a ) .",
    "technically this means that the full 2@xmath112 spin structure of the quasiclassical green s functions , defined by eq .",
    "( [ nambu ] ) , is to be retained in the ferromagnetic side of the interface .",
    "this case , relevant for weak ferromagnets , has been widely studied in the literature ; the standard description simply involves a spin - dependent shift in the quasiparticle energy , effected by the replacement    @xmath106    in the eilenberger equation ( [ eilen ] ) . here",
    "@xmath5 is the exchange - field parameter and @xmath107 is a pauli spin matrix .",
    "other fermi - surface parameters , _ i.e. _ fermi velocities and the density of states , are assumed identical for the two spin bands in the ferromagnet .",
    "= 0.5    in this article we restrict ourselves to the opposite limiting case of strongly ferromagnetic materials , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ interface]b .",
    "that is , we assume the exchange splitting and the resulting directional deviation of the two spin trajectories sharing the same parallel momentum to be so large that the coherence between them is lost completely . as a consequence ,",
    "the quasiclassical propagators have no matrix structure in spin space .",
    "in particular , conventional andreev reflection processes are forbidden because electrons and holes in opposite spin bands occupy different trajectories which do not interfere with each other .",
    "trajectories with different spin orientations can only be coupled incoherently , such as _ e.g. _ due to elastic spin - flip scattering by magnetic impurities .",
    "it should be emphasized that no energy shift of the form ( [ shift ] ) should be introduced in this limit ; instead , fermi velocities and the density of states become spin dependent .",
    "the reason for this is that the integration over the energy of relative motion ( `` @xmath35 integration '' ) , employed in the formal process of converting the full two - particle green s function into quasiclassical ones , is now performed separately around the two different fermi surfaces .",
    "this is in contrast to the case of weak ferromagnets , where the same @xmath35-integration range is used for both fermi surfaces simultaneously .",
    "a very interesting special case which falls into the latter category of ferromagnets with strong spin splitting is that of half - metallic materials .",
    "in fact , half metals are metallic in one of the spin bands only  the other one is insulating .",
    "such behaviour has recently been reported in cro@xmath108 @xcite and in certain manganite materials.@xcite and has attracted considerable attention because of possible applications in the emerging field of spintronics .",
    "@xcite since in half metals a fermi surface only exists for one of the spin orientations , the standard description for weak ferromagnets is obviously inapplicable .",
    "however , half metals still allow for a straightforward quasiclassical treatment in the separate - band picture : quasiparticle trajectories simply exist only for one of the spin orientations .",
    "the quasiclassical boundary conditions in the hopping description involve surface scattering matrices @xmath81 that characterize a fully reflecting interface . in the case of a magnetically active interface the most general form of such matrices ( for quasiparticles ) , satisfying the requirement of unitarity , was pointed out by tokuyasu",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite to be    @xmath109    where @xmath110 is a unit vector pointing to the direction of the surface magnetization and @xmath111 is a vector constructed of pauli spin matrices .",
    "the corresponding scattering matrix for quasiholes follows from eq .",
    "( [ tilde ] ) . dropping the irrelevant overall phase factor @xmath112 ,",
    "the surface scattering matrix is determined by a single parameter , the spin - mixing angle @xmath113 .",
    "the physics behind spin mixing can be visualized as follows : even for a fully reflecting interface , incident wave functions penetrate a small distance into the forbidden , spin - polarized region .",
    "this results in different matching conditions for waves with opposite spin directions and , consequently , different phase shifts for the reflected waves .",
    "the relative phase difference introduced by spin mixing results in interesting nontrivial phenomena at superconductor / ferromagnet interfaces , even in the absence of quantum - mechanical coherence between the two spin bands in the ferromagnet .",
    "one such example is the recent prediction of a nonvanishing josephson current in a heterostructure with a mesoscopic half - metallic piece separating two singlet superconductors  driven by spin - triplet pairing correlations.@xcite ( this effect requires , in addition to spin mixing , also the presence of spin - flip centers at the interfaces ) .",
    "however , even though spin mixing is expected to be an intrinsic feature of any spin - active interface , systematic experimental estimations of the typical magnitudes of @xmath113 are not yet available . as a guideline for such future experiments , we study in the following chapter the differential conductance of a spin - mixing point contact between a singlet superconductor and a strong ferromagnet  simultaneously offering a view of the @xmath0-matrix approach at work .",
    "we consider a point contact with arbitrary transmission separating a conventional singlet superconductor and a strong ferromagnetic material .",
    "the small ( compared with the coherence length of the superconductor ) dimensions of the contact and , consequently , the small size of the current flowing through it does not appreciably affect the state of the coupled half - spaces from that corresponding to zero transmission .",
