    "quantum game theory has become a new area of application of quantum theory .",
    "it has attracted much attention . among them , two - player quantum game @xcite , multi - player non - cooperative quantum game @xcite and the cooperative three player quantum game @xcite have been reported recently .",
    "the prisoner s dilemma game has been demonstrated recently in nmr experiment@xcite . in classical game theory",
    ", the cooperation of the players means that they can exchange completely information with one another , and they take the strategy to the most behoof of themselves . in this way , co - operators can be seen as one player .",
    "it is very important in cooperative game that each party in a cooperation must take coordinated strategies . for this purpose , in game theory , nash equilibrium(ne ) is an important concept . in an nash equilibrium",
    ", each player obtains his / her optimal payoff , and if he / she tries to change his / her strategy from the ne strategy , his / her payoff will become less . in cooperative quantum game ,",
    "the situation is similar .    in this paper",
    ", we study a game played by 3 and 4 players .",
    "the rules for the cooperative 3 player game were given in ref.@xcite .",
    "suppose that there are three players denoted as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are cooperators are @xmath3 is solitary .",
    "each player has a strategy set @xmath4 .",
    "the payoff set for the corresponding strategies is @xmath5 .",
    "it is a function of the strategy @xmath6 .",
    "each player can choose one of the two strategies denoted as @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "in each play , if there is a player uses the minority strategy , then this player is a looser and he / she has to give one penny to each of the other two players . in the 4 player cooperative game , the model and the rules are similar . but in this case",
    ", there is a possibility that every two players choose the same strategy , then there is no gain or loss for anyone .    in the quantum version of this game ,",
    "an multi - qubit initial quantum state is prepared by an arbiter and the qubits are sent to all players at random , one qubit for each player .",
    "it is assumed that each player possesses local unitary operators @xmath9 @xmath10 and @xmath11 on their own qubit at their proposal , and then sends the qubit back to the arbiter . upon receiving all the qubits ,",
    "the arbiter will measure them to get the results and distribute the payoff to each player . in this work",
    ", we studied two different ways each player performs his / her strategies . in the classical probability operator(cpo ) way , each player is allowed to perform @xmath10 and @xmath12 with probability @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively . in cpo ,",
    "the players work exactly the way as in a classical game .",
    "the only difference is that they lay their bet on a quantum state . in ref.@xcite",
    ", the strategy is performed in this way . in a quantum superposed operator(qso ) way , each player is allowed to perform an unitary operation that is a linear combination of @xmath10 and @xmath12 : @xmath15 .",
    "this corresponds to a physical implementation that each player is allowed to use linear superposition of the identity operator and the @xmath12 .",
    "acting upon state @xmath16 , it produces @xmath17 .",
    "if one makes measurement on this state , he / she will have @xmath13 probability to obtain 0 , and @xmath14 probability to obtain 1 .",
    "this is closely related to cpo and classical game with @xmath13 probability to choose 0 and @xmath14 probability to choose 1 .",
    "the cooperative quantum game between 3 players using cpo has been studied in ref.@xcite . in our work",
    ", we study the 3 and 4 player quantum minority game using qso and the 4 player game using cpo .",
    "we found that qualitatively , qso and cpo produce the same outcome , but they differ in details in quantity . it is found that in a cooperative quantum game , the initial state plays a crucial role .",
    "for some initial state , cooperation is very important .",
    "for some other initial state , cooperation becomes useless .",
    "this is quite different from what we know in a classical game theory .",
    "now we come to the three cooperative quantum game ( tcqg ) .",
    "the players implement their strategies by applying the identity operator @xmath10 and the @xmath18-spin flip @xmath19 the three player cooperative game with cpo has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we will discuss this game with qso .",
    "we assume that the cooperators take the correlated operations to the their qubits .",
    "now suppose the initial state is @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 . because @xmath1 and @xmath2 are cooperators , in term of the rules , they take the same strategies , so they do the same operations on their respective qubits : @xmath23 . @xmath24takes operation @xmath25 .",
    "after the operations have been performed , the state of the system becomes @xmath26    the payoff of player a is the sum of squares of the coefficients of @xmath27 and @xmath28 : @xmath29 where @xmath30 .",
    "we have plotted the payoff of a with respect to @xmath13 and @xmath31 in fig.1 .",
    "`` @xmath32 '' is a measure of entanglement of the initial state . when `` @xmath32''=0 , the initial state is a product state and there is no entanglement in it .",
    "we see from fig.1a that there is clearly a saddle point in the 3-dimensional figure .",
    "as `` @xmath32 '' increases to @xmath33 , the saddle point becomes shallower(fig.1b ) .",
    "when `` @xmath32''=1 , the system has maximum entanglement , and the saddle becomes flat(fig.1c ) .",
    "this clearly shows that the initial state is very important in the cooperative game .",
    "the 3d - figure displays a shape of saddle , and the saddle - point is just the ne point . to gain the optimal payoff",
    ", we let @xmath34   combining eqs.[e3 copy(1)]([e3a ] , [ e3b ] ) , we can get @xmath35 . substituting into eq.([e2])[e2 copy(2 ) ] , then the payoff @xmath1 can get is @xmath36    the relation between @xmath37 and @xmath32 is shown in fig .",
    "similarly , the payoff of @xmath2 and @xmath3 are : @xmath38    for players @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the larger the numerical value of @xmath32 , the more their payoff .",
    "the payoff of player @xmath1 varies continuously with the change in the value of @xmath32 .",
    "when @xmath39 , in other words , the initial state is @xmath40 or @xmath41 , the payoff is the same as that in a classical game , @xmath42 the payoff is 0.5 .",
    "when the initial state has maximum entanglement , his payoff achieves the maximum , 1 .",
    "thus , cooperation must have more advantage for @xmath1 and @xmath43 , and their cooperation will be all to nothing going on . certainly , @xmath44 , that is , our scheme is still a zero - sum game but that in ref .",
    "@xcite is not .",
    "in fact , when the initial state is @xmath45+@xmath46 , we can use the same method to find out the equilibrium point .",
    "similarly , the players can take the strategies described above .",
    "then , @xmath47 in term of this equation , we can write the payoff of @xmath1 : @xmath48 the relation between @xmath49 and these parameters can be seen from fig .",
    "3 . the saddle - point still exists",
    ". we can find out the maximum payoff by solving the following equations : @xmath50 we get the saddle - point at @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and then @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",
    "the result is the same as that discussed just above . in the classical game ,",
    "the ne strategy is a point , and so is their corresponding payoff .",
    "but in the quantum game , their ne strategies depend on the initial entangle state . furthermore ,",
    "in this situation , the cooperation must be of advantage for players @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and this is the very reason for their continuance of cooperation .",
    "up to now , no one has studied the four cooperative quantum game ( fcqg ) . in this section",
    "we will investigate fcqg in cpo . here",
    "what the players do is similar to that metioned above .",
    "the initial state @xmath56 , where @xmath57 .",
    "each player takes operation @xmath10 with classical probabilities @xmath13_,_@xmath31 _ , _ @xmath58 _ , _",
    "@xmath59 , respectively , but the @xmath18-spin - flip operator @xmath11 with probabilities @xmath14 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 respectively .",
    "after the performance of the strategies , the state of the system changes from @xmath63 to an mixed state represented by a density operator , @xmath64 .",
    "in fact , the state becomes an mixed state when player take strategy in cpo manner .",
    "for convenience , the following notations are introduced : @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , which are the probabilities of the system ending up at state @xmath69 $ ] , @xmath70 $ ] , @xmath71 , @xmath72 $ ] respectively .",
    "@xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath67 , @xmath75 are the probabilities of the system being in state @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath71 , @xmath78 respectively .",
    "the relation between these quantities is @xmath79 where @xmath80 ^t   \\label{e10}\\ ] ] and    @xmath81,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where a bar over a character means 1 minus this quantity , e.g. @xmath82 .",
    "the matrix @xmath83 is calculated as follows @xmath84 .\\ ] ] the matrix is symmetric . the payoff of the players @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath85 in each basis state @xmath86 are denoted as @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , where range of @xmath91 is from @xmath7 through @xmath92 .",
    "for instance for player @xmath1 , the payoff in the basis states are @xmath93 in the end of the game , the payoff function of player @xmath1 is @xmath94 for cooperative game , we let @xmath95 then the corresponding payoff for player a will be simplified from eq.([e13 ] ) with those terms deleted . under this condition ,",
    "the payoff for player @xmath3 is @xmath96    initial state in quantum game is important in deciding the fairness of the game .",
    "next we discuss some special initial states .",
    "first if the initial state has the form where @xmath97 , then we know @xmath98 and @xmath99 , and @xmath100 in general , quantum game in cpo is not zero - sum .",
    "this is a zero - sum game is obtained . for this initial state , players @xmath1 and @xmath2 will choose @xmath101 or @xmath102 to gain the maximum payoff .",
    "they get @xmath103 .",
    "although players @xmath1 and @xmath2 are dominate , their maximum payoff is not better than that of classical counterpart .    in another example with @xmath104 ,",
    "no entanglement exists in the initial state , we have @xmath105 when @xmath106 , both the payoff of @xmath1 and @xmath2 are @xmath107 .",
    "equilibrium point is obtained at @xmath108 or @xmath101 together with @xmath109 . the payoffs for players a , b , c and d are @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath112 respectively .",
    "the sum of the payoff of four players @xmath113 is also zero - sum .",
    "the sensitive dependence of the results on initial state is best explained by the following example where we allow the initial state to have some components of non - cooperation , such as components with nonzero @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "assuming an initial state with @xmath118 the payoffs of player a is then @xmath119 expression for @xmath120 is obtained by exchanging @xmath13 and @xmath31 in eq.([pa ] ) .",
    "the payoff for player c is @xmath121 by exchanging @xmath58 with @xmath59 in eq.([pc ] ) , expression for @xmath122 can be obtained .",
    "if the coefficients is chosen as @xmath123 , then we will arrive at an equilibrium .",
    "all the payoffs become zero . under this circumstance ,",
    "whatever strategies the players take , their payoff are all zero .",
    "it is the same as a complete non - cooperative quantum game , and the advantages of the cooperators in a classical game are completely eliminated .",
    "suppose the initial state is @xmath124 .",
    "players @xmath1 and @xmath2 take their correlated operation @xmath125 , player @xmath3 and @xmath85 take strategy @xmath126 and @xmath127 respectively . after the operations of their strategies ,",
    "the state of the system becomes @xmath128    by summing up of square of the related coefficients , @xmath49 is obtained as follows @xmath129 where @xmath30 .",
    "the equilibrium can be obtained by solving the following equations @xmath130    the solution is @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath131 .",
    "this result does nt depend on the initial state parameters @xmath132 and @xmath133 . substituting this to eq .",
    "( [ e23 ] ) , the payoff is @xmath53 .",
    "the payoff depends on the initial state entanglement parameter @xmath32 .",
    "the dependence is exactly the same as that shown in fig.2 .",
    "compared with the classical result , there is additional parameter @xmath32 and it plays a key role in determining the value of payoff .",
    "furthermore , once @xmath39 , the payoff @xmath134 and the quantum properties of the game disappeared , namely , the game degenerated to a classical one .",
    "meanwhile , the payoffs of @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath85 are : @xmath135 we can verify easily that @xmath113 , it is a zero - sum game . for the maximum entanglement state , the corresponding payoff of @xmath1 takes its maximum @xmath8 .",
    "it is twice as much as that in a classical game .",
    "next we consider another initial state , @xmath136 .",
    "after the completion of strategy operations , the state of the system becomes : @xmath137",
    "we find that the payoff of player @xmath1 is @xmath138 , and @xmath139 , @xmath52 , @xmath131 is the ne point where @xmath140 .",

    "the expressions for the functions of payoff of the players are given .",
    "it is found that in a cooperative quantum game , the initial state is important for all players .",
    "for some special initial states , the cooperation will become important .",
