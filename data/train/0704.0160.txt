    "the main source of oxygen production has since long been identified as due to supernovae from massive stars ( type ii supernovae ) . yet , the exact process by which chemical enrichment proceeds is poorly known ( see a review by scalo & elmegreen 2004 ) .",
    "ten years ago , tenorio - tagle ( 1996 , hereafter t - t96 ) proposed a scenario in which the metal - enhanced ejecta from supernovae follow a long excursion in galactic haloes before falling down on the galaxies in the form of oxygen - rich droplets .         40  myr , supernovae explode , creating a hot superbubble confined within a large expanding supershell that bursts into the galactic halo .",
    "the superbubble contains the matter from the oxygen - rich supernova ejecta mixed with the matter from the stellar winds and with the matter thermally evaporated from the surrounding supershell.,width=288,height=288 ]    in the present work ( the full version of which has been submitted to astronomy & astrophysics , stasiska et al .",
    "2007 ) , we suggest that the discrepancy between the oxygen abundances derived from optical recombination lines ( orls ) and from collisionally excited lines ( cels ) in hii regions ( see e.g. garca - rojas et al . 2006 and references therein ) might well be the signature of those oxygen - rich droplets .",
    "in fact , tsamis et al . ( 2003 ) and pquignot & tsamis ( 2005 ) already suggested that the orl / cel discrepancy in hii regions is the result of inhomegeneities in the chemical composition in these objects .",
    "our aim is to explicit the link between the orl / cel discrepancy and the t - t96 scenario , and to check whether what is known of the oxygen yields allows one to explain the orl / cel discrepancy in a quantitative way .",
    "figures 15 present the t - t96 scenario in cartoon format .",
    "the details of the physical arguments concerning the amount of oxygen available in the droplets , the mixing processes , as well as the simulation of the orl - cel discrepancy with a multizone photoionization model are described in stasiska et al .",
    "( 2007 ) . here",
    ", we simply give the most important conclusions .",
    "photoionization of the oxygen - rich droplets predicted by the t - t96 scenario can reproduce the observed abundance discrepancy factors ( adfs , i.e. the ratios of abundances obtained from orls and from cels ) derived for galactic and extragalactic hii regions . the recombination lines arising from the highly metallic droplets thus show mixing at work .",
    "we find that , if our scenario holds , the recombination lines strongly overestimate the metallicities of the fully mixed hii regions .",
    "the collisionally excited lines may also overestimate them , although in much smaller proportion . in absence of any recipe to correct for these biases ,",
    "we recommend to discard objects showing large adfs to probe the chemical evolution of galaxies .      on the theoretical side",
    ", one needs more robust estimates of the integrated stellar yields as well as a better knowledge of the impact of massive stars on the ism and of the role of turbulence .",
    "all these issues are relevant to our understanding of the metal enrichment of the universe ."
