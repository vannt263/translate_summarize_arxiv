    "the solutions of the saddle - point equations reflect the electron - hole symmetry of the formalism . a very good agreement between our results and those of nrg for @xmath86 ( strongly - interacting case )",

    "this is in part due to the fact that in the ehsc , where analytical results can be obtained ( see appendix [ sec : verification_fsr ] ) , the formalism reproduces the correct exponential dependence of the width of the resonance in the spectral density of states @xmath87 , which roughly coincides with the kondo temperature @xmath88 .",

    "kotliar and ruckenstein proposed a remedy to this problem , replacing some operators entering @xmath23 in eq.([hmixboson ] ) by another ones ( containing some suitable chosen roots ) which coincide with the previous ones when the constraints are imposed exactly on each site , and at the same time reproduce in the saddle - point approximation , the correct results for the noninteracting case.@xcite unfortunately , we find that this method does not work in the whole range of @xmath91 , giving an overestimated kondo temperature in the strongly - interacting limit .",
    "in contrast , as mentioned above , the formalism so far presented gives the correct dependence of @xmath92 on the parameters in this limit ( see appendix [ sec : verification_fsr ] ) .",
    "since we are mainly interested in the limit of strong correlations , the results shown in fig .",
    "[ comp1d ] are encouraging . for small or moderate values of @xmath4 one can use ptu.@xcite in spite of this good agreement",

    "this is an artifact of the saddle - point approximation , reported before in other problems,@xcite for example in the conductance through rings of quantum dots.@xcite beyond some value of the gate voltage @xmath6 , the impurity decouples from the rest of the chain .",
    "the decrease in the conductance out of the ehsc is due to the reduction of the density of states at the fermi level , as the system approaches the intermediate valence regime .",
    "technically , in the saddle - point approximation as @xmath93 increases , the magnitude of boson @xmath36 also increases ( the charge in the dot decreases ) .",
    "this causes the magnitude of the boson @xmath94 to decrease and the resonance in @xmath76-electron density of states must be shifted to higher frequencies in order to decrease the @xmath95 occupation , according to the constraint eq .",
    "( [ constraint2 ] ) .",
    "this causes a reduction in the value of @xmath96 at the fermi level , and a reduction in the conductance ( see eq .",
    "( [ landauer ] ) ) . in a similar fashion ,",
    "when the dot is charged , the value of the boson @xmath37 increases , the value of @xmath95 approaches to @xmath97 , and the resonance in the density of states must be shifted to lower frequencies , producing an analogous decrease in the conductance .    for the simple case of conduction through one dot ,",
    "the expression of the conductance can be written as @xcite @xmath98 at very low temperatures ( @xmath99 ) , the system is a fermi liquid .",
    "therefore , the friedel s sum rule ( fsr ) @xcite must hold . for the case in which the hybridization @xmath9 and the unperturbed density of conduction states @xmath100 do not depend on energy ,",
    "the fsr takes the form @xmath101 giving a conductance equal to    @xmath102    where @xmath103 is the total charge per spin in the dot .",
    "it can be shown ( see appendix [ sec : verification_fsr ] ) that the saddle - point approximation verifies the fsr , since the real problem is mapped into an effective non - interacting one whose ground state is a fermi sea .      the results for conductance through three qd s using the saddle - point approximation described in appendix [ sec : spa ] , are shown in fig .",
    "results for one qd for the same parameters are also shown for comparison .        on a qualitative level , the results for three qd s are similar to those of one qd near the ehsc .",
    "in particular , the conductance equals the ideal one @xmath104 in the ehsc , decreases as the amount of charge fluctuations increases , and finally becomes very small when the ground state of the interacting region becomes non - magnetic .",
    "the reduction of the region in which the conductance is near to the ideal one is reduced in the three - dot case , and one expects further reduction as the odd number of dots @xmath0 increases .",
    "this is due to the fact that as @xmath0 increases , the energy of singlets with @xmath26 particles become nearer to that of the ground - state doublet with @xmath0 particles . as a consequence , the interval of gate voltage @xmath6 between both intermediate valence regimes ( when the energy of one singlet coincides with that of the doublet )",
    "is reduced .",
    "when @xmath6 is moved further from the ehsc , an important difference between @xmath1 and odd @xmath105 is that in the latter case , magnetic states with @xmath106 particles become accessible , a new kondo effect takes place , and another plateau with near ideal conductivity appears . for @xmath107",
    "this pattern with regions of nearly ideal or zero conductivity can be repeated several times . in general , including even @xmath0 , there should be plateaus when the gate voltage favors an odd number of particles . in particular , for @xmath108 the conductance in a similar system has been calculated using nrg and displays two plateaus , corresponding to 1 and 3 particles in the interacting region.@xcite . while we have limited our calculations to odd",
    "@xmath0 and gate voltages such that either @xmath0 or @xmath26 particles are favored , it is straightforward to extend the formalism to other cases , as long as the hybridization @xmath9 of the interacting region with the rest of the system is small enough .",
    "the allowed magnitude of @xmath9 for the validity of the formalism is discussed in the next section .",
    "we have verified numerically that eq .",
    "( [ fsrc ] ) also holds for three dots .",
    "the formalism is identical for other odd @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , near the ehsc the situation for different odd @xmath0 are qualitatively similar in that they show a local fermi liquid behavior , ideal conductance at the ehsc , and the expected electron - hole symmetry .",
    "this is at variance with the results of bsser _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite who find vanishing conductance at the ehsc , but are consistent with those of oguri,@xcite and recent studies for @xmath2,@xcite who also obtain ideal conductance at the ehsc .",

    "[ isosc ] .",
    "two regimes in parameter space were analized , namely @xmath110 and @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the new hopping term connecting dot 1 and -1 .",
    "these regimes correspond to the conductance through the two possible `` isosceles triangles '' . in the case",
    "@xmath113 ( equilateral triangle ) , the subspace with @xmath114 has a doubly degenerate ground - state , with states belonging to the even and odd subspace respectively .",
    "this can be understood by recalling that the symmetry group of the equilateral triangle in two dimensions ( @xmath115 ) has one two - dimensional irreducible representation . as it will be discussed in detail in section [ sec : summary ] ,",
    "the present formalism is not valid at this point of parameter space , since we assumed a non - degenerate ground - state .",
    "since experimentally is very hard to reach such a regime , we believe that this is not a serious constraint of the method .",
    "starting with the linear chain ( @xmath116 ) , we recall that the ground - state of the @xmath114 subspace is an odd @xmath117 doublet . switching on adiabatically the hopping @xmath112 ,",
    "the energy of the excited even doublet begins to fall , and after crossing the degeneracy point @xmath118 , the even doublet takes over and the formalism is valid again .",
    "besides these features , we expect the development of a plateau in the conductance at the ideal value in a certain region of @xmath119 , due to the fact that the problem still can be mapped into an effective @xmath117 anderson impurity coupled to conducting leads .        in fig .",
    "[ cond_isosc1 ] we show the results for the conductance through the isosceles triangle .",
    "for simplicity we have set parameters @xmath120 and @xmath121 , so that the first result ( @xmath116 ) is one of the curves of fig .",
    "as @xmath112 is increased , the curves are approximately rigidly shifted to lower values of @xmath119 .",
    "this feature can be correlated with properties of the isolated trimer . in order to gain physical insight , we define the following functions of the isolated trimer :    @xmath122        which are the differences in energy between ground - states belonging to subspaces with different particle number .",
    "fixing @xmath123 and @xmath4 , we define @xmath124 and @xmath125 as the values of @xmath93 which render @xmath126 and @xmath127 respectively .",
    "these values correspond to an intermediate valence regime of the efective anderson model , and are related to the crossover regions in the dependence of the conductance @xmath5 with gate voltage , where @xmath5 falls down from its ideal value at the plateau to zero .",
    "this is due to charge fluctuations and the consequent dissapearance of the kondo effect . following the evolution of the points @xmath124 and @xmath125 as a function of @xmath112",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ dif_i ] ) , the evolution of the conductance curves in fig .",
    "[ cond_isosc1 ] can be explained easily : the conductance is related to the low - energy physics of the isolated trimer . for example , for @xmath128 , the first value of @xmath119 for which @xmath129 in fig .",
    "[ cond_isosc1 ] is near @xmath130 , the value for which the number of particles in the ground - state of the isolated trimer changes from 4 to 3 ( see fig .",
    "[ dif_i ] ) .",
    "as it is already clear from fig .",
    "[ 3d1d ] , the width of the crossover regions increases with @xmath9 , since the effective hybridization @xmath131 is proportional to it and therefore the widths of intermediate valence regimes increase accordingly .",
    "the results for @xmath132 are shown in fig .",
    "[ cond_isosc2 ] .",
    "the asymmetry in the curves is more evident , and again the plot can be understood by following the evolution of @xmath133 and @xmath134 ( see fig .",
    "[ dif_p ] ) .",
    "when @xmath132 , the low - energy physics of the system resembles that of a singlet formed by the two qd s connected by @xmath112 plus an additional qd on the top . in this situation , there is a considerable decrease in the effective hybridization @xmath131 ( see eq .",
    "[ vnu ] ) .",
    "this is directly reflected in that the kondo temperature is much lower than before , rendering the convergence of the numerical method difficult .",
    "for that reason , in those calculations we have set @xmath135 in order to have a larger kondo temperature .",
    "the validity of the formalism is only slightly affected , despite the fact that @xmath9 is comparable to other energy scales ( @xmath136 ) .",
    "the main reason for this is the high values of @xmath112 , which ensure a large difference between the ground state energy and that of the excited odd doublet for @xmath114 .",
    "another reason is the small effective hybridization .",
    "other details on the validity of the approximation will be given in the next section .",
    "as a final comment , we mention that the results obtained for these geommetries are consistent with those obtained with the fsr ( eq . ( [ fsrc ] ) ) for the effective anderson model .",
    "we have presented an effective site approach to study the conductance through an arrangement of @xmath0 qd s , diagonalizing exactly the part of the hamiltonian describing the interacting region and retaining the most relevant states which describe the low - energy charge excitations . as discussed below",
    ", the approach is valid when the hybridization @xmath9 of the interacting region with the rest of the system is small .",
    "the advantage of this mapping is that the physics of one impurity is rather well understood , and several good approximations can be used .",

    ", we obtain perfect conductance at the ehsc .",
    "since this result might seem controversial at present , we discuss in detail the approximations involved in our treatment , particularly in relation to this result .",
    "the crucial approximation is to retain only the lowest doublet of the magnetic configuration , neglecting the excited ones ( see fig .",
    "[ subspaces ] ) .",
    "this approximation scheme is only valid as far as the excited levels have a negligible contribution to the many - body ground state .",
    "the hybridization @xmath9 induces a second - order matrix element @xmath137 between the ground state of the magnetic configuration in the interacting region and excited states for the same number of particles .",
    "in particular , for the linear trimer , while the ground state for three particles is an odd doublet , the most relevant excited state for three particles is an even doublet .",

    "thus , we conclude that this set of parameters is quite consistent with the approximation .",
    "quantitative details of our results are also affected by two other approximations related with our slave - boson treatment : i ) the neglect of the triplet states in the subspaces of @xmath26 particles in the interacting region , and ii ) the fact that the saddle point chooses the most convenient solution between those with definite parity in these subspaces : either @xmath154 or @xmath155 for all @xmath32 . however , in the kondo regime of most interest , the model reduces to a one - impurity kondo model , and for the linear trimer , both approximations slightly modify the kondo temperature and in opposite directions.@xcite therefore our conclusions are not affected . in particular , the system remains a fermi liquid with ideal conductance in the ehsc .",
    "for other problems and larger @xmath9 , the effects of the triplets can be important near the singlet - triplet degeneracy.@xcite    as argued before,@xcite if the system is a fermi liquid , its properties at low - energy are expected to be the same as those of a non - interacting system , and therefore , one expects non - zero conductance in the ehsc .",
    "then , the possibility of vanishing conductance in this case , seems to be related with the breakdown of the fermi liquid . for a trimer ( @xmath2 ) with @xmath115 symmetry , a non - fermi liquid ground state results as a consequence of the degeneracy between odd and even doublets in the ground state of the interacting region.@xcite in this case , although eq .",
