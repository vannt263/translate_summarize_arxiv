    "at the beginning of the campaign in 2004 , we have carried out a literature study to collect a complete sample of all known stars within 10pc .",
    "we found 274 targets with final or tentative parallaxes larger than 100mas .",
    "232 of these stars were successfully observed from two sites :    128 stars on the northern and southern hemisphere were selected for observations with the ulbcam at the uh88 telescope on mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "two epochs were obtained for all stars in multiple runs between september 2005 and february 2008 .",
    "depending on the seeing conditions , an average limiting magnitude of @xmath019mag was achieved in _",
    "the fov of ulbcam is about 16@xmath116 arcmin .",
    "104 stars with low southern declinations were imaged in two epochs with sofi at the 3.5 m ntt on la silla , chile .",
    "an average depth of h@xmath2mag was achieved in a field of 5@xmath15 arcmin .",
    "observations were carried out in four runs between january 2005 and june 2006 .",
    "both surveys are sensitive to brown dwarfs with masses as low as @xmath025m@xmath3 at an age of 5gyrs ( according to theoretical isochrones by baraffe et al . ) .",
    "this survey extends previous campaigns ( e.g. , @xcite ) and complements coronographic search programs for close companions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "images with the ulbcam were taken in read - resetread mode .",
    "data reduction followed the standard technique of flatfielding and background subtraction .",
    "the large fov of the camera leads to noticeable field distortions which had to be corrected before co - adding the individual frames .",
    "we used the _ terapix _",
    "@xcite packages _ sextractor _ , _ scamp _ and _ swarp _ to correct the distortions ( see fig .  1 ) , to calibrate the astrometry of the images",
    "( see fig .",
    "2 ) , and finally combining them to a full mosaic .",
    "two final images of the same field were obtained for each of the 232 targets with an epoch difference of one year .",
    "object detections were performed with _ sextractor _ and _ idl / starfinder_. the two source catalogues were than compared to identify objects with a proper motion identical to the nearby star in the same field .",
    "in addition , visual inspection of both images ( the classical `` blinking '' method ) was used to ensure results in crowded fields .    the ongoing analysis of the complete southern sample ( 100 fields obtained with sofi at the 3.5 m ntt ) and the first 20 images of the northern sample revealed no new companion candidate .",
    "this seems to indicate a much lower fraction of low - mass wide companions among the stars in the solar neighbourhood than found in younger clusters and star forming regions .    a possible scenario to explain the deficiency of weakly bound companions is the enhanced gravitational interaction of old stars with the galactic disk .",
    "hence , the expected low mass companions of these stars were teared away and are no longer co - moving with their stellar counterpart ."
