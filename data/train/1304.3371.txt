    "the absence of any experimental signal , so far , in the searches for supersymmetry ( susy ) at the lhc  @xcite and the discovery of a new higgs - like particle by atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite with a mass @xmath18 125 - 126 gev , are pushing the susy mass parameters above the 1-tev range . on one hand ,",
    "the present lower mass bounds for squarks of the first and second generations and for gluinos are already above 1 tev , and on the other hand , if the observed higgs boson is identified with the lightest higgs boson @xmath6 of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , a radiatively corrected mass @xmath19 125 - 126 gev also implies rather heavy squark masses of the third generation ( mainly stop masses ) at or larger than 1 tev . in principle , to place the susy masses at the multi - tev range",
    "seems discouraging , both from an experimental point of view due to the inability to detect susy directly , and from a theoretical point of view , in regard to the naturalness of the theory , which contrarily suggests a soft susy - breaking scale , @xmath20 , at or below the tev scale .",
    "however , leaving the naturalness issue aside , the mssm scenarios with very heavy susy masses can have other interesting aspects  @xcite .",
    "in particular , this is the case of specific higgs boson observables , like certain higgs partial decay widths , which present a non - decoupling behavior with @xmath20 , as shown , for instance , in  @xcite , opening a new window to the indirect detection of heavy susy .",
    "as it is well known , the decoupling of susy radiative corrections in the asymptotic large susy mass limit is valid for susy theories with an exact gauge symmetry , in agreement with the general decoupling behavior of heavy states in quantum field theory as stated in the famous appelquist - carazzone theorem  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is also known that this theorem does not apply to theories with spontaneously broken gauge symmetries , nor with chiral fermions , which is the case of the mssm .",
    "furthermore , in order to have decoupling , the dimensionless couplings should not grow with the heavy masses .",
    "otherwise , the mass suppression induced by the heavy - particle propagators can be compensated by the mass enhancement provided by the interaction vertices , with an overall non - decoupling effect , which is exactly what happens in some mssm higgs boson decays to fermions .",
    "for instance , it was studied in  @xcite how non decoupling appears for large susy masses in the @xmath21 decay through one - loop susy - qcd corrections , when the involved susy particle masses grow simultaneously with a generic soft susy - breaking scale @xmath20 ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "a similar non - decoupling behavior was obtained for flavor changing neutral higgs boson decays into quarks of the second and third generations through both susy - qcd corrections  @xcite and susy - ew corrections  @xcite .",
    "other interesting non - decoupling susy - ew effects have also been seen in lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) higgs boson decays within the context of the mssm - seesaw model  @xcite ; and in higgs - mediated lfv processes like : @xmath22 decays  @xcite , some semileptonic @xmath23 decays  @xcite and in @xmath24 conversion in heavy nuclei  @xcite ; all of them within the mssm - seesaw model too .",
    "other non - decoupling effects from heavy susy particles have also been noticed within the context of the susy inverse - seesaw model  @xcite .",
    "some studies of susy non decoupling within the mssm have also been performed in the effective field theory approach where the effective higgs - fermion - fermion vertices are induced from one - loop corrections of heavy susy particles  @xcite and in @xmath25 production  @xcite .    in the present work , motivated by the recent discovery of the sm - like higgs boson",
    ", we will focus on the study of the lfv higgs boson decays and we will work within the context of the mssm at one - loop order with the hypothesis of general slepton flavor mixing .",
    "we will extend the study to the three neutral higgs bosons of the mssm @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath26 , considering the new higgs - like particle to be the lightest higgs boson @xmath6 .",
    "in particular , we will study the lfv higgs decays @xmath13 , @xmath27 and @xmath8 .",
    "this kind of processes provide an unique window into new physics due to the strong suppression of flavor violation in the standard model ( sm ) , where the flavor mixing is induced exclusively by the yukawa couplings of the corresponding fermion sector .",
    "this is specially interesting in the lepton sector in which the flavor mixing will be hugely suppressed because of the smallness of the lepton yukawa couplings .",
    "therefore , the discovery of any process which violates the lepton flavor number would be a clear signal of physics beyond the sm .",
    "lfv is nowadays a very active field which is being studied in different models , through several channels ( for a review , see for instance @xcite ) : radiative decays @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 ; 3-body decays @xmath22 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 ; @xmath24 conversion in nuclei ; semileptonic @xmath23 decays ; among others . the specific case of lfv higgs",
    "decays within supersymmetric models has also deserved special attention in the literature  @xcite . also encouraging results for the reach of lfv higgs",
    "decays at the lhc have been recently obtained in @xcite within the context of a general effective lagrangian approach .",
    "our purpose here is to take advantage of the mentioned non - decoupling behavior with @xmath0 in the lfv higgs decay widths into charged leptons of different generations , @xmath33 , with @xmath34 and @xmath35 , in order to look for sizeable branching ratios which can give rise to detectable signals at the lhc .",
    "here and from now on , @xmath36 with @xmath34 in the final state of the lfv decays refers to either @xmath37 or @xmath38 . in general , the radiatively corrected lfv higgs couplings to leptons are proportional to the heaviest lepton mass involved , being this the reason why we select the @xmath39 channel as the most promising one .",
    "in addition , the @xmath40 channel is extremely restricted by the associated radiative decay , @xmath30  @xcite , leaving us almost no room to move in the allowed parameter space of slepton flavor mixing , and driving us to extremely low rates , not measurable in any lhc detector . the @xmath41 channel , on the other hand , gives us very similar results to the @xmath39 channel , and from an experimental point of view , the lhc sensitivity to the former should be equivalent to the latter  @xcite .",
    "therefore the results obtained along this work for the lfv higgs decays into @xmath39 are straightforwardly translated into the @xmath41 channels . for the present study we will focus then on",
    "the @xmath42 decays within the mssm at one loop with general slepton flavor mixing between the second and the third generations , without assuming any particular source of flavor mixing .",
    "consequently , this general slepton mixing will be parametrized in a model - independent way by four dimensionless parameters , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "it is important to remark that our calculations will be made in the mass eigenstate basis for all mssm particles , including both charged sleptons and sneutrinos with the corresponding exact diagonalization of the full charged slepton and sneutrino mass matrices , and therefore we will not use here the mass insertion approximation ( mia ) .",
    "the most important constraints to these four slepton mixings come from the @xmath28 searches  @xcite .",
    "a recent study on updated constraints to all these general slepton flavor mixings @xmath47 in @xcite indicates that , indeed , the present bounds to br@xmath48 lead to constraints on the 23 mixings which for 500 gev @xmath49 1500 gev and 5 @xmath50 60 are at @xmath51 , and @xmath52 , and for heavier susy masses lead to weaker bounds . we will check that by raising the susy mass scale into the multi - tev range will turn into the needed relaxation of these bounds , since these lfv radiative decays present a decoupling behavior with the susy scale .",
    "this will allow us to explore a high susy mass scale region , where we will find very promising values for the lfv higgs rates .",
    "our paper is structured as follows : in section  [ theory ] we describe the mssm frame which we will use in the rest of the paper , introducing the flavor mixing and the scenarios we will work with .",
    "section  [ lfvrates ] is devoted to the lfv higgs decay rates in the heavy susy particle mass limit , showing the non - decoupling behavior of these rates with @xmath0 .",
    "we dedicate section  [ lfvxsections ] to the relevant numerical results of the lfv higgs event rates at the lhc , considering the effects induced by each type of delta , @xmath53 .",
    "this will be done taking into account the conditions of the present and future phases of the lhc , in order to estimate the number of events one could expect for each lfv higgs channel .",
    "we will finally close the paper with the conclusions , contained in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "in this paper we explore susy scenarios with general flavor mixing in the slepton sector , which have the same particle content as the mssm . within these scenarios ,",
    "the most general hypothesis of flavor mixing assumes a non - diagonal mass matrix in flavor space , for both charged slepton and sneutrino sectors .",
    "the charged slepton mass matrix is a @xmath54 matrix due to the six electroweak interaction eigenstates , @xmath55 with @xmath56 .",
    "the inclusion , within the mssm , of only three sneutrino eigenstates , @xmath57 with @xmath58 , reduces the sneutrino mass matrix to a @xmath59 matrix . in the case in which slepton and sneutrino mass matrices were diagonal",
    ", we would still have a tiny flavor violation induced by the pmns matrix of the neutrino sector and transmitted by the tiny neutrino yukawa couplings , but we neglect it here .    the non - diagonal entries in the @xmath54 slepton matrix can be described in a model - independent way in terms of a set of dimensionless parameters @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ; @xmath62 ) , where @xmath63 stand for the possible chiralities of the lepton partners and @xmath64 indexes run over the three generations . these scenarios with general sfermion flavor mixing lead generally to larger lfv rates than in the so - called minimal flavor violation ( mfv ) scenarios , where the mixing is induced exclusively by the yukawa coupling of the corresponding fermion sector .",
    "this statement is true for both squarks and sleptons but it is obviously of special interest in the slepton case due to the extremely small size of the lepton yukawa couplings .",
    "hence , in the present case of slepton mixing , the @xmath60 s will provide the unique origin of lfv processes with potentially measurable rates .",
    "one usually starts with the non - diagonal @xmath54 slepton squared mass matrix referred to the electroweak interaction basis , which we order here as ( @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 ) , and write this matrix in terms of left- and right - handed blocks @xmath71 ( @xmath61 ) , which are non - diagonal @xmath72 matrices , @xmath73 where @xmath74 with flavor indexes @xmath62 , corresponding to the first , second and third generations , respectively .",
    "@xmath75 is the weak angle , @xmath76 is the @xmath77 gauge boson mass , @xmath78 are the lepton masses , @xmath79 with @xmath80 and @xmath81 , the two vacuum expectation values of the corresponding neutral higgs boson in the higgs @xmath82 doublets , @xmath83 and @xmath84 , and @xmath85 is the usual higgsino mass term .",
    "it should be noted that the non diagonality in flavor comes exclusively from the soft susy - breaking parameters , which could be non vanishing for @xmath34 , namely : the masses @xmath86 for the slepton @xmath82 doublets @xmath87 , the masses @xmath88 for the slepton @xmath82 singlets @xmath89 , and the trilinear couplings , @xmath90 .    in the sneutrino sector",
    "there is , correspondingly , a one - block @xmath72 mass matrix , respect to the @xmath91 electroweak interaction basis , @xmath92 where @xmath93    it should be also noted that , due to @xmath94 gauge invariance , the same soft masses @xmath86 enter in both the slepton and sneutrino @xmath2 mass matrices . besides , in the previous equations we have neglected the neutrino mass terms , which due to their extremely small value are totally irrelevant for the present computation .",
    "the general slepton flavor mixing is then introduced via the non - diagonal terms in the soft - breaking slepton mass matrices and trilinear coupling matrices , which are defined here as @xmath95",
    "@xmath96 @xmath97    in all this work , for simplicity , we are assuming that all @xmath60 parameters are real .",
    "therefore , hermiticity of @xmath98 and @xmath99 implies @xmath100 . besides , in order to avoid extremely large off - diagonal matrix entries we restrict ourselves to @xmath101 .",
    "it is worth to have in mind for the rest of this work that our parametrization of the off - diagonal in flavor space entries in the above mass matrices is purely phenomenological and does not rely on any specific assumption about the origin of the mssm soft - mass parameters . in particular",
    ", it should be noted that our parametrization for the @xmath3 and @xmath4 squared mass entries connecting different generations ( i.e. for @xmath34 ) assumes a similar generic form to the @xmath2 and @xmath5 entries .",
    "for instance , @xmath102 .",
    "this implies that our hypothesis for the trilinear off - diagonal couplings @xmath103 with @xmath34 ( as derived from eq.([v1al ] ) ) is one among other possible definitions considered in the literature . in particular , it is related to the usual assumption @xmath104 , by setting @xmath105 . here , @xmath106 , @xmath107 is the charged gauge boson mass , @xmath108 is the @xmath94 gauge coupling and @xmath20 is a typical susy mass scale .",
    "it should be also noted that the diagonal entries in eq.([v1al ] ) have been normalized as it is usual in the literature , namely , by factorizing out the corresponding lepton yukawa coupling : @xmath109 , with @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "finally , it should be mentioned that our choice in eqs.([mll ] ) , ( [ v1al ] ) and ( [ mrr ] ) is to normalize the non - diagonal in flavor entries with respect to the geometric mean of the corresponding diagonal squared soft masses .",
    "for instance , @xmath113    the next step is to rotate the sleptons and sneutrinos from the electroweak interaction basis to the physical mass eigenstate basis , @xmath114 with @xmath115 and @xmath116 being the respective @xmath117 and @xmath72 unitary rotating matrices which yield the diagonal mass - squared matrices as follows , @xmath118    in the numerical computations of the present study we will restrict ourselves to the case where there are flavor mixings exclusively between the second and third generations of sleptons , thus we set all @xmath60 s to zero except for @xmath119 . on one hand ,",
    "the lfv one - loop corrected higgs couplings are proportional to the heaviest lepton mass involved  @xcite and , therefore , the higgs decay rates into @xmath40 are suppressed by a factor @xmath120 with respect to the @xmath121 decay rates . on the other hand ,",
    "the related lfv radiative decay @xmath30 has a much more restrictive upper bound  @xcite than @xmath29 and @xmath28 decays  @xcite , and the present allowed values of the @xmath122 s would not drive us to any measurable @xmath123 rates .    in order to simplify our analysis , and to reduce further the number of independent parameters",
    ", we will focus on the following numerical study on simplified susy scenarios , where the relevant soft - mass parameters are related to a single susy mass scale , @xmath0 .",
    "in particular we choose the following setting for the relevant mass parameters : @xmath124 where @xmath125 is a constant coefficient that we will fix in the next sections to different values , namely , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , 1 .",
    "we also set an approximate gut relation for the gaugino masses : @xmath128 here and in the following we use a short notation for the common soft masses , namely , @xmath129 for @xmath130 , etc .",
    "for simplicity , we have also assumed vanishing soft - trilinear couplings for the first and second generations in the slepton sector , i.e. , @xmath131 . we have checked that other choices with non - vanishing values for any of these two couplings do not alter the conclusions of this work .",
    "the trilinear coupling for the third generation has been fixed here to the generic susy mass scale , @xmath132 .    regarding the non - diagonal trilinear couplings we have also assumed a rather simple but realistic setting by relating them with the single soft susy - breaking mass scale , @xmath0 . specifically , we assume the following linear relation : @xmath133 where the new dimensionless parameters @xmath134 and @xmath135 are trivially related to the previously introduced ones @xmath136 and @xmath137 of eq.([deltas23defs ] ) by : @xmath138 it is clear from eq.([lrversuslrtilde ] ) that @xmath136 and @xmath137 scale with @xmath0 as @xmath139 . therefore ,",
    "in the forthcoming analysis of the lfv observables , whenever the decoupling behavior of these observables with large @xmath0 be explored we will use instead the more suited parameters @xmath134 and @xmath135 , which can be kept fixed to a constant value while taking large @xmath0 values .    concerning the size of the flavor violating trilinear couplings that are of relevance here , @xmath140 and @xmath141",
    ", there are well - known theoretical upper bounds that arise from vacuum stability .",
    "if any of these trilinear couplings is too large , the mssm scalar potential develops a charge and/or color breaking ( ccb ) minimum deeper than the standard - model - like ( sml ) local minimum or an unbounded from below ( ufb ) direction in the field space @xcite .",
    "then the requirement of the absence of these dangerous ccb minima or ufb directions implies specific upper bounds on the size of the non - diagonal trilinear couplings , and consequently on the size of the flavor changing deltas . for the case of interest here the upper bound from stability can be written simply as @xcite : @xmath142 and similarly for @xmath141 . here",
    ", @xmath143 is the yukawa coupling of the tau lepton , and the squared soft mass @xmath144 can be written as : @xmath145 in our simplified scenarios for the slepton , gaugino and higgs sectors , with just three mssm input parameters , @xmath0 , @xmath146 , and @xmath147 , and by considering eqs.([trilinear23 ] ) and ( [ lrversuslrtilde ] ) , the previous bound implies in turn the following bound on @xmath136 , and correspondingly on @xmath134 ( and similar bounds for @xmath148 ) : @xmath149 for example , if we take @xmath150 tev we get upper bounds for @xmath151 of @xmath152 in the low @xmath146 region close to 5 , and of @xmath153 in the large @xmath146 region close to 50 .",
    "these correspond to an upper bound on @xmath154 of @xmath155 that is nearly independent on @xmath146 and it gets weaker for larger @xmath0 values due to the scaling factor ( @xmath156 ) in eq.([delta23bounds ] ) .",
    "however , the reliability of these bounds have been questioned in the literature because of the fact that the existence of deeper minima than the sml local minimum does not necessarily imply a problem whenever the lifetime of this false sml vacuum is sufficiently long . in this later case ,",
    "other theoretical upper bounds based on metastability then apply . indeed , by demanding that the lifetime of the whole observable universe staying at the sml vacuum be longer than the age of the universe the constraints on the flavor changing deltas",
    "get much more relaxed  @xcite . according to @xcite the upper bounds on @xmath136 from metastability ,",
    "in contrast to the limits from stability , turn out to be independent on the yukawa coupling , they do not decouple for asymptotically large @xmath157 and they are dependent on @xmath146 .",
    "for instance , for @xmath158 and @xmath159 tev the metastability limit on @xmath136 gets weaker than its stability bound by a factor of 40 , whereas for @xmath160 and @xmath159 tev it is weaker by a smaller factor of 4 , leading to approximate upper bounds of @xmath161 and @xmath162 respectively .",
    "this translates into an upper bound of about @xmath163 for @xmath164 and @xmath165 tev .",
    "the numerical estimates of these metastability bounds are done considering each delta separately ( i.e setting the other deltas to zero value ) and for a specific assumption of the relevant euclidean action providing the decay probability via tunneling of the metastable vacuum into the global minimum .",
    "changing the input value for the euclidean action can increase notably the maximum allowed value up to almost doubling it , leading to roughly @xmath166 .",
    "the effects on these bounds from switching on more than one delta at the same time have not been considered yet in the literature but they could relevantly modify these bounds . for the present work , and given the uncertainty in all these estimates of the upper bounds from stability and metastability arguments , we will consider a rather generous interval when performing the numerical estimates of branching ratios and event rates . concretely",
    "we will choose several examples for @xmath134 of very different size that will be taken within the wide interval @xmath167 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath168 for the particular values of @xmath169 5 tev and @xmath170 40 .    on the other hand ,",
    "the values of the soft masses of the squark sector are irrelevant for lfv processes , except in the present case of lfv mssm higgs bosons decays where these parameters enter in the prediction of the radiatively corrected higgs boson masses . since we want to identify the discovered boson with the lightest mssm higgs boson , we will set these parameters to values which give a prediction of @xmath171 compatible with the lhc data . specifically , we fix them to the particular values @xmath172 @xmath173 @xmath174 @xmath175 @xmath176 5 tev , which we have checked provide a value for @xmath171 that lies within the lhc - favored range [ 121 gev , 127 gev ] for all the mssm parameter space considered here .    in summary ,",
    "the input parameters of our simplified susy scenarios are : the mass of the pseudoscalar higgs boson , @xmath147 , the ratio of the two higgs vacuum expectation values , @xmath146 , the generic susy mass scale , @xmath0 , and the four delta parameters , @xmath9 , @xmath12 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( or @xmath134 and @xmath177 alternatively to the two latter ) , which we vary within the following intervals :    * 200 gev @xmath178 1000 gev , * 1 @xmath179 60 , * 0.5 tev @xmath180 10 tev , * @xmath181 @xmath9 , @xmath12 @xmath182 , * @xmath183 @xmath184 , @xmath185 @xmath186 , + ( or , equivalently , @xmath187 for @xmath169 5 tev and @xmath170 40 ) .",

    "we refer the reader to  @xcite . it should be also noted that , since we are assuming real @xmath47 s , the predictions for br@xmath192 and the cp - conjugate br@xmath193 are the same .",
    "thus , we will perform our estimates for just one of them and will denote this rate generically by br@xmath194 . obviously , in the case that these two channels can not be differentiated experimentally one should then add the two contributions to the total final number of events .",

    "the mass spectrum of the mssm higgs sector , with two - loop corrections included , and their corresponding total widths are calculated by means of the code feynhiggs  @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     finally , the results for the @xmath13 and @xmath8 channels in the double @xmath2 and @xmath3 mixing case are summarized in figures  [ neventsh - matanb - deltalldeltalr ] and  [ neventsa - matanb - deltalldeltalr ] , respectively .    the predictions for the contour lines of @xmath13 event rates ( figure  [ neventsh - matanb - deltalldeltalr ] ) show a clear different pattern than in the previous cases of single deltas . in both lhc phases ,",

    "the only notable differences that we find between the results of these two cases are in the slight different patterns of the contour lines , signalling a small different sensitivity to @xmath147 and/or @xmath146 . also one can appreciate in these plots that one gets a bit lower rates for + 5 than for -5 , in agreement with our previous findings reported in figure  [ brs - deltatildelrrl ]    the number of events for the @xmath8 channel in the double @xmath2 and @xmath3 mixing case are displayed in figure  [ neventsa - matanb - deltalldeltalr ] .",

    "on one hand , independently if @xmath9 , @xmath12 , @xmath10 or @xmath11 are the responsible for the intergenerational mixing in the slepton sector , these lfv higgs decay rates remain constant with @xmath0 at large @xmath205 2 tev . on the other hand , the related lfv radiative decay ,",
    "@xmath28 , manifests a fast decoupling behavior with @xmath0 and its rates are very suppressed for large values of the susy scale . in this work ,",
    "we have taken advantage of these two remarkable different behaviors with @xmath0 in order to reach sizeable lfv higgs branching ratios which are yet allowed by the present @xmath28 upper bound .    from our detailed analysis of the lfv",
    "higgs decays , we have learned that the single @xmath206 mixing of @xmath5 type in the slepton sector can not by itself provide sufficiently large rates which could be measurable at the lhc .",
    "the situation ameliorates slightly if we consider the single @xmath2 mixing case , with the largest rates at the large @xmath146 region and amounting up to about 5 lfv events for the @xmath207 channels at the future phase of the lhc .",
    "we find that the mixing parameter @xmath10 ( and @xmath11 ) is the most relevant one and even when acting as single mixing parameter already gives rise to sizeable and allowed by data lfv higgs - mediated event rates for sufficiently large values of @xmath208 tev , where the lfv radiative @xmath28 rates are suppressed below its present experimental upper bound . in this single @xmath3-mixing case , we also find that the most promising channel is by far the @xmath13 decay for which we predict up to 50 events for low @xmath209 in the present phase of the lhc . regarding the @xmath207 channels ,",
    "no events are expected in the present lhc phase if there is single @xmath3 ( and/or @xmath4 ) mixing .",
    "the situation improves noticeably if one considers the future phase of the lhc . in this case , with a total integrated luminosity of 100 fb@xmath210 , we predict hundreds of lfv events from the lightest higgs boson decay into @xmath39 , as much as @xmath211 events for very low values of @xmath146 . for the lfv heavy higgs bosons",
    "decays the expectations are lower , but also increase in comparison with the present lhc phase , and a few events could be obtained depending on the values of @xmath147 , @xmath146 and @xmath0 .",
    "finally , by considering double @xmath2 and @xmath3 mixings we obtain the most interesting situation , since on one hand the rates are slightly increased with respect to the single @xmath3 mixing case and , on the other hand , the slight change in the sensitivity to @xmath146 makes that larger values of this parameter than in the single @xmath3 mixing case give rise also to sizeable event rates .",
    "for instance , one can get in this double mixing case a few events at the present stage of the lhc even for moderate @xmath212 and large @xmath213 500 gev . in the future lhc phase the reach to larger @xmath209 values increases and one gets some event even at very large @xmath214 and @xmath215 800 gev .",
    "the largest rates found are in any case for @xmath13 and are clearly localized at the low @xmath146 region where we predict for the present lhc phase up to about 75 events , and up to about 750 lfv events for the future lhc phase . in the future lhc phase , we get about 10 events at the most for the @xmath207 channels in the low @xmath209 region and 5 events at the most in the high @xmath209 region . as a final comment ,",
    "it is worth recalling that all the rates presented in this work are doubled if one adds the decay events for the two possible final states , @xmath216 and @xmath217 .",
    "the encouraging results presented along this work strongly suggest that a dedicated search for the proposed lfv higgs decays is extremely worthwhile and we believe that it should be further studied by the experiments at the lhc",
    ". if the susy mass scale is too heavy , as the present experiments are pointing out , and the susy particles can not be directly reachable at the present or next future lhc energies , our proposal for lfv higgs decays could provide an unique window to explore new physics and to find some hint of very heavy susy at the lhc .",
