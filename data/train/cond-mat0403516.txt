    "the well - known harmonic approximation reduces @xmath6 to a sum of quadratic terms , i.e. , the linear klein - gordon ( kg ) hamiltonian .",
    "so , the schrdinger equation can be solved analytically .",
    "the elementary excitation is a plane wave called an _",
    "optical phonon _ and whose energy is fixed by the wave momentum @xmath7 , in the lattice brillouin zone .",
    "a consequence of the ideal harmonicity is that higher order excitations are simply the linear superpositions of these optical phonons .    for larger displacements ,",
    "some non - quadratic contributions are involved in the expansion of @xmath6 .",

    "a convincing agreement was found between theory@xcite and experiments@xcite in molecular crystals where the internal molecule bonds yield a strong nonlinearity .",

    "the authors identified these specific excitations as being some quantum breathers ( see refs . for more details about quantum breathers ) because of their counterparts in classical mechanics@xcite . nonetheless , the approach proposed in ref .",
    "requires a huge computing cost so the size of lattices was limited to a one - dimensional ( 1d ) chain of 8 unit cells .",
    "moreover , the numerical simulations were restricted to the parameter region where the non - harmonic part of the lattice energy is modelled by a quartic onsite potential , i.e. , the well - known @xmath8 model . in the present paper",
    ", we propose a numerical treatment of the nonlinear kg lattice which takes advantage of the weak coupling ( @xmath5 in eq.[debyemodif ] ) . that permits to analyze lattices large enough to approach the infinite system features and to study different types of nonlinearity , as well as the two - dimensional ( 2d ) kg lattice .",
    "we confirm that when nonlinearity is significant , a pairing of optical phonon states occurs and the so - called biphonon@xcite branch contributes to the energy - spectrum .",

    "then , in the energy - spectrum , the biphonon gap vanishes at the center , whereas a pseudogap is found to open at the edge of bz .",
    "we predict that the pseudogap is a systematic feature of lattices in which nonlinearity is moderate , whatever is the lattice dimension or the dominant nonlinearity , i.e. , @xmath9 or @xmath8 .",
    "in addition , we enhance how quantum properties of the biphonon depends on the nonlinearity .",

    "in contrast , thanks to the first step of our algorithm which solves the single site nonlinear eigenvalue problem , we can treat all types of nonlinearity ( weak or strong and with @xmath9 or @xmath8 terms ) , provided the inter - site coupling is not too large .",

    "similar results are found for the triphonon states whose branch is labelled by the tag @xmath125 in fig.[fig7 ] .",

    "however , at the edge of bz , the binding energy is comparable to the width of the phonon branch @xmath138 ( inserts in figs.[fig5](b ) and [ fig6](b ) ) .",

    "the variations of the energy branches of the nonlinear excitations are labelled by tags defined previously .",

    "the agreement between the long range behavior of phonon states and @xmath178 holds in the harmonic lattice provided that @xmath85 is not too large",
    ". this can be checked by comparing the formula @xmath181 for a single phonon state in the harmonic chain with the equation eq.[eqw ] , noting that for a quadratic form of @xmath4 , we have @xmath182 and thus @xmath183 .",
    "the agreement between the coefficient @xmath170 and the long range modulations of @xmath171 is not strictly proved for biphonon and triphonon ( see tab.[tab ] and figs.[fig12](b - c ) and [ fig15](b - c ) ) because the corresponding branches are too close from the unbound phonon bands .",
    "nevertheless we estimate that the agreement roughly holds , whereas in figs.[fig13](b ) it does not because the biphonon gap closes for small @xmath7 .",
    "provided the @xmath184 discrete branch is isolated in the energy spectrum , there is no conceptual difference between @xmath139 phonon bound states and single phonon states because they all come from the raising of the translational degeneracy of the onsite eigenstates @xmath58 . actually , we conclude that the coefficient @xmath170 is a good indicator of long range correlations for the @xmath139 phonon bound states ( including phonon states with @xmath174 ) on the condition that the hybridization with other phonon states is negligible . therefore ,",
    "when @xmath185 , the @xmath139 phonon bound states exhibit a finite correlation length provided the @xmath184 discrete branch is isolated in the energy spectrum . in fig.[fig12](b ) , the space correlation function drops to zero for the large @xmath158 and for all @xmath7 in agreement with @xmath186 equals zero ( see tab.[tab ] ) .    as shown in tab.[tab ] , @xmath187 decreases to zero with increasing @xmath139 . above @xmath188 , @xmath170 may be consider as physically negligible . by extension of our results about space correlations of the @xmath139 phonon bound states with @xmath189",
    ", it is expected that the @xmath139 phonon bound states with @xmath190 have a finite correlation length provided their energy branch remains isolated from the linear combination bands of the lower energy states , i.e. , from the unbound phonon states as well as from the combinations of the lower order multi - phonon bound states ( for instance , see @xmath135 in fig.[fig7 ] ) . for the specific case @xmath21 and @xmath191 , the even values of @xmath139 verify @xmath185 , so the corresponding @xmath139 phonon bound states have also a finite correlation length when their branch is isolated in the spectrum . for a closing biphonon gap , a pseudogap was found to persist at the edge of the lattice brillouin zone ( sec.[results ] ) . in fig.[fig13](b ) , it is shown that the biphonon states have a finite length scale in @xmath7-range where the pseudogap opens .",
    "indeed , due to hybridization with the 2 phonon unbound states , the biphonons at @xmath192 have a non - vanishing space correlation function which goes beyond the finite lattice size .",
    "+ the phonon bound states with a finite correlation length exhibit a singular feature that is worth characterizing more precisely . for that purpose ,",
    "denote by @xmath193 the wave function of the @xmath139 phonon bound state with momentum @xmath7 and by @xmath194 the dimensionless energy of the @xmath57 branch .",
    "one introduces the time dependent wannier state @xmath195 , which is constructed from a combination of the @xmath139 phonon bound states : @xmath196 the subscript @xmath197 indicates the lattice site where is centered the wannier transform . in fig.[fig18 ] , the scalar product @xmath198 is plotted for @xmath199 .",
    "fixing @xmath21 and @xmath120 , the parameter @xmath98 is increased from zero .",
    "the scalar product @xmath200 is proved to equal @xmath131 when the gaps that surround the @xmath57 branch are large , or equivalently when @xmath98 is large .",
    "then , one can reasonably argue that the bloch wave @xmath164 is a very good approximate of the @xmath139 phonon bound state and the corresponding eigen - energy is approached by a perturbative theory : @xmath201 when @xmath21 , the correlation function @xmath202 is zero for all @xmath158 ( since @xmath203 , see tab.[tab ] ) , so for the biphonon , we obtain @xmath204 .",
    "then the energy @xmath205 does not depend on @xmath7 , @xmath206 , and the wannier state @xmath207 can thus be rewritten as follows : @xmath208 it is obvious that such a state is a localized and time periodic excitation .",
    "the classical counterparts of such state would be the breather solutions for the classical nonlinear discrete lattice , e.g. a. j. sievers and s. takeno@xcite .",
    "these classical breather solutions have two important features that are first their spatial localization and second their time periodicity with a frequency that is out of both the linear classical phonon branch and its resultant harmonic bands ( for an exact proof see ref . ) .",
    "our proposition about the classical counterparts could be justified by comparing the energies of a localized time periodic wannier state and the semi - classical quantization of the classical breather orbits , in same lattice . in the simple case of zero inter - site coupling @xmath93",
    ", such a comparison has been performed for the onsite double - well potential ( see fig.[fig1](a ) and text in sec.[computing ] ) . the remarkable agreement obtained at @xmath93 ,",
    "allows to expect that our proposition holds for weak values of @xmath85 , at least . extending our sketch to all @xmath139 phonon bound states ,",
    "the conditions for a breather - like wannier state in a kg lattice are twofold : first , the branch of the @xmath139 phonon bound states must be isolated by large surrounding gaps and second , @xmath185 .",
    "let us detail the breaking of these conditions .",
    "when the @xmath57 branch is isolated but @xmath209 , the @xmath210 are still some good approximates for the @xmath139 phonon bound states ( see in fig.[fig18 ] for the phonon and triphonon ) .",
    "then the band width of the @xmath211 branch does not vanish because of the self - tunneling of @xmath212 , i.e. , the intersite coupling hybridizes the bloch wave @xmath210 with itself .",
    "the wannier transform ( eq.[wta ] ) of @xmath212 is a combination of states non - coherent in time , since @xmath213 depends on @xmath7 .",
    "it is no longer a time - periodic solution . after a certain time @xmath214 ,",
    "the bloch waves @xmath212 do no longer interfere .",
    "this @xmath214 varies inversely to the band width of the @xmath57 branch . on the other hand , when @xmath215 but the @xmath57 branch is not isolated , the bloch wave @xmath212 is hybridized with unbound phonon states .",
    "then the wannier state in eq.[wta ] is no longer strongly localized as the breather - like wannier state in eq.[wta2 ] , but it shows some spacial extensions .",
    "in addition , @xmath216 depends on @xmath7 ( as shown in fig.[fig5](b ) , for the biphonon ) .",
    "hence the wannier transform is not coherent in time and @xmath217 is not time - periodic .",
    "in the present paper , the pairing of phonon states in the nonlinear kg lattice has been considered with numerics .",
    "first , the biphonon spectral features have been studied and a pseudogap has been shown to characterize lattices where nonlinearity is comparable to phonon band width , whatever are the lattice dimension and the type of nonlinearity .",
    "second , we have shown how properties of the kg biphonon depend on the nonlinearity . in the specific case of a strong @xmath8 nonlinearity",
    ", the biphonon states feature a finite correlation length .",
    "the corresponding wannier transforms are breather - like excitations that remain coherent for a duration which increases with the strength of the @xmath8 nonlinearity .",
    "in contrast , when a @xmath9 nonlinearity predominates , the biphonon exhibits a long range correlation and biphonon tunneling is no longer negligible , although it remains weaker than for single phonons . according to our results on the triphonon",
    ", one may expect that the tunneling of the high energy multi - phonon bound states vanishes for any type of nonlinearity , provided that their energy branches avoid the unbound phonon bands .",
    "then some high energy breather - like excitations could occur .",
    "these states should correspond to the semiclassical quantization of the classical breather orbits .",
