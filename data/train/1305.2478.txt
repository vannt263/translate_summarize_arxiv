    "the origin and nature of ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) remains unsolved in contemporary astroparticle physics .",
    "possible indications of sources or excesses in the arrival direction distribution of uhecrs have been claimed by ground - based experiments , though not fully confirmed @xcite . in order to be identified from earth , extremely powerful sources capable of accelerating cosmic rays up to ultra - high energies must be within a limited range of distances set by the greisen - zatseptin - kuzmin ( gzk ) effect @xcite .",
    "since the distribution of matter within the gzk range is inhomogeneous and anisotropic , one would expect uhecr arrival directions to exhibit a corresponding anisotropy . to identify the sources of uhecrs , measurements of the energy spectrum and arrival directions with high statistics are essential .",
    "this is rather challenging because of the extremely low flux of a  few  per  km@xmath0 per century at extreme energies such as @xmath1  ev .",
    "the observational exposure is , therefore , a critical factor .",
    "jem - euso ( the extreme universe space observatory on - board the japanese experiment module ) @xcite on the international space station ( iss ) @xcite is an innovative space mission .",
    "looking down the earth from space , it utilizes the atmosphere as a detector of cosmic ray air showers with the aim of significantly increasing the exposure to uhecrs compared to the largest ground - based air shower arrays presently in operation @xcite .",
    "the jem - euso telescope will be accommodated on the exposed facility ( ef ) on the jem module _",
    "@xcite of the iss .",
    "the scientific objectives include charged particle astronomy and astrophysics , as well as , other exploratory objectives @xcite such as the detection of extreme energy gamma rays and neutrinos .",
    "the jem - euso telescope exploits the fluorescence light that is emitted during the development of the extensive air shower ( eas ) , initiated by a primary cosmic ray particle in the atmosphere to estimate the particle s energy and arrival direction .",
    "this is an established technique that has been employed by several ground - based uhecr observatories @xcite , but never in space - based observations .",
    "the estimation of the exposure of a space - based experiment such as jem - euso requires accounting for : a ) the characteristics of the eas development in the atmosphere as observed from space , b ) the properties of the telescope , including its orbit and field of view ( fov ) , c ) the various sources of steady background like night - glow and moonlight , d ) the overall optical transmission properties of the atmosphere , in particular the possible presence of clouds , and e ) the effect of anthropogenic light , atmospheric flashes such as transient luminous events ( tles ) and meteors . items a ) and b ) are the principal factors determining the threshold in energy and maximum aperture of the telescope .",

    "items d ) and e ) affect the instantaneous aperture of the telescope . in the following sections , all of these aspects will be reviewed .",
    "the outline of this article is as follows : in section  [ apparatus ] , we summarize the key aspects of the jem - euso mission . in sections  [ background ] and  [ sec :",
    "clouds ] , we discuss the estimation of the observational duty cycle , local light effects and the role of clouds .",
    "section  [ trigger ] is devoted to the trigger architecture and eas simulation .",
    "computation of the aperture for both clear and cloudy conditions will be described in section  [ sec : aperture ] . the exposure in the nadir observation and its uniformity",
    "will then be derived in section  [ exp - exp ] .",
    "the paper concludes with a discussion of the results and a summary in sections  [ discussion ] and  [ summary ] .",
    "the jem - euso telescope @xcite consists of four principal parts : the photon collecting optics @xcite , the focal surface ( fs ) detector @xcite , the electronics @xcite , and the mechanical structure @xcite .",
    "the main parameters of jem - euso telescope are summarized in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the telescope optics consists of three double - sided curved circular fresnel lenses with 2.65  m maximum diameter .",
    "the minimum diameter of the lenses is 1.9  m owing to cuts on opposite sides .",
    "this shape is referred to as ` side - cut ' and is required to satisfy constraints of the h - iib transfer vehicle ( htv ) _ kounotori _ @xcite which will transport the jem - euso telescope to the iss .",
    "the uv photons are focused onto the fs which consists of 137 photo - detector modules ( pdms ) .",
    "each pdm comprises of a @xmath2 set of elementary cells ( ecs ) .",
    "each ec is formed by a @xmath3 array of multi - anode photomultiplier tubes ( mapmts )  hamamatsu photonics k.k .",
    "r11265 - 03-m64  with @xmath4 (= 64 ) pixels .",
    "each pixel has a spatial resolution of @xmath5 .",
    "the fs detector converts photons into electrical pulses with @xmath62  ns width , which are counted by the electronics during a gate time unit ( gtu ) of 2.5  @xmath7s .",
    "the imaging part of the telescope is an extremely fast , highly pixelized , large - aperture , and wide - fov digital camera .",
    "it is sensitive to near ultraviolet ( uv ) wavelength band between about 300 and 430  nm with single photon counting capability .",

    "the trigger efficiency depends on @xmath14 .",
    "high altitude clouds in particular absorb eas signals emitted beneath the cloud and result in a significant lowering of the trigger efficiency . at middle altitudes , @xmath15 @xmath16  km , clouds only influence eass of small zenith angles , which develop at lower altitudes .    in the presence of high clouds with @xmath17 , the signal from an eas below cloud level",
    "is only attenuated by a factor of @xmath18 and the effect on the trigger efficiency is limited . if @xmath14 is well below the altitudes where eas develop , the clouds do not attenuate the signals . as a result of the different cuts ,",
    "@xmath19 slowly increases with energy .    the results in table  [ table_single ]",

    "for cloudy cases , the average of all triggered events is shown by triangles and it tends to increase with energy .",
    "the results obtained by applying the selection @xmath8 for @xmath20 cases is indicated by filled circles .",
    "this cut requires that for optically thick clouds , the eas maximum is located above the cloud - top .",
    "this ensures that fitting the eas profile will not introduce significant distortion of the reconstructed eas profile . with the above cut",
    ", the fraction of selected events over the ones triggering in clear - sky conditions ( the reference case ) is almost constant at higher energies .",
    "this is because a certain fraction of clouds with @xmath21 exist at higher altitudes . from table",
    "[ tab2 ] , for example , clouds with @xmath22  km account for @xmath620% of cloud coverage .",
    "therefore , a part of eas develops below such clouds . as",
    "this value is nearly constant as a function of energy , we define it as the ` cloud efficiency ' @xmath9 and it accounts for @xmath23 of the trigger eass above @xmath24  ev .",
    "this is due to the fact that the average @xmath25 dependence is dominated by the zenith angle .",
    "the energy plays a smaller role .",
    "the value @xmath26 is an important factor for estimating the effective exposure of the mission .",
    "currently , a detailed study on the reconstruction of the events passing such a trigger selection as well as those occurring in a clear atmosphere is in progress .",
    "it should be emphasized that the main telescope of jem - euso will be operated along with am system @xcite .",

    "the operational inefficiencies related to iss ( rockets docking on iss , lid operation , detector maintenance or aging , etc . ) as well as quality cuts on reconstruction are not taken into account yet , and will be addressed in future . therefore , the present results constitute an upper limit on the effective exposure of the instrument for the assumed conditions .    : a ) entire observation area ( filled circles ) ; b ) cut on distance @xmath30  km and on zenith angle @xmath31 ( open squares ) .",
    ", width=287 ]    in figure  [ fig224 ] , the annual exposure as a function of energy is shown .",
    "the filled circles indicate the geometrical aperture for the entire observation area .",
    "the open squares include a zenith angle cut of @xmath31 and a cut on distance of @xmath30  km .",
    "these two exposures correspond to the highest and lowest aperture curves of figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "the jem - euso annual exposure for the full sample of data is expected to be @xmath6 9 times larger than that of the pierre auger observatory with the corresponding annual exposure of about 7000  km@xmath0  sr yr , at energies around @xmath32  ev . because of the steeply rising aperture at lower energies , the subsets of data with reduced and flat exposure will be used to cross - check with measurements by other ground - based experiments down to @xmath33  ev .",
    "it is important to underline that the cuts shown in figure  [ fig224 ] are extreme in order to obtain at @xmath34  ev an annual exposure comparable to that of auger , which means acquiring a statistically similar data sample . as shown in figure  [ fig2 ] for the apertures , less stringent geometrical cuts will lead to different exposure curves located in between the two lines shown in figure  [ fig224 ] with a flat plateau starting gradually at higher energies . in this way , it will be possible to have a comparison of uhecr fluxes for one entire decade in energy using the data acquired without geometrical cuts .",
    "it is worthwhile remembering here that the aperture and exposure have been derived with specific assumptions on the detector properties , background level , shower development in atmosphere , etc .",
    "all the systematic uncertainties that would increase or decrease the collected light at telescope level , either for the eas or for the background , would be responsible to shift the energy scale of the aperture and exposure curves by the square root of the systematic uncertainty .",
    "on the other hand , the scaling factor would be linear in case it involves only the eas propagation ( i.e. hadronic interaction model , fluorescence yield ) .    in the previous analysis , a constant background level of @xmath35  photons m@xmath36  ns@xmath37  sr@xmath37 was assumed .",
    "however , the background is variable with time . to take into account the effective background variation ,",
    "the exposure over the time when @xmath38 given as a function of @xmath39 is approximated by the following relation : @xmath40        figure  [ bg - threshold ] shows the exposure as a function of @xmath39 for various maximum allowed background levels obtained by convolving the trigger probability at a specific fixed background level with the fraction of time during which such background level occurs according to the estimation by equations  ( [ eqn : obsduty ] ) and ( [ eqn : moonshine ] ) . as described in section  [ trigger ] , the trigger system is capable of dynamically adjusting the thresholds to cope with variable background intensity .",
    "the trigger efficiency curve scales in energy approximately in a proportional way to @xmath41 because it depends on the poissonian fluctuations of the average background level .",
    "the exposure obtained with a fixed @xmath42 of 500 photons m@xmath36  ns@xmath37  sr@xmath37 is essentially equivalent to the one obtained from equation  ( [ eqn : conv ] ) when the integration of @xmath42 is extended up to 1600 photons m@xmath36  ns@xmath37  sr@xmath37 .",
    "it is possible to observe that at higher energies there is still some margin of gain if a higher level of background is accepted ( see i.e. the curve at less than 6300 photons m@xmath36  ns@xmath37  sr@xmath37 ) .",
    "this is particularly useful to explore the extreme energy ranges where the flux is rapidly decreasing with energy . in any case , all the conclusions obtained in this paper are derived assuming only the standard condition of 500 photons m@xmath36  ns@xmath37  sr@xmath37 constant background level .    unlike ground - based observatories , the global iss orbit and better sensitivities for eas with large zenith angles",
    "allows observation of the entire celestial sphere .",
    "the exposure distribution is practically flat in right ascension .",
    "apart from possible local or seasonal deviation from the global average of cloud coverage and of background level , the relationship between the expected overall exposure and declination can be analytically calculated as a function of only @xmath43 , knowing the observable nighttime at a given latitude .",
    "( dashed line ) and @xmath44 ( dotted line ) . the vertical axis indicates the deviation from the uniform distribution.,width=287 ]    .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the expected distribution of observed exposure as a function of declination on the celestial sphere with different zenith angle cuts for all zenith angles ( solid line ) , @xmath45 ( dashed line ) and @xmath44 ( dotted line ) . the vertical axis indicates the deviation from the uniform distribution",
    ".    for the case of @xmath44 , minor excesses and deficits arise in very limited regions near celestial poles and equator , respectively .",
    "this is because the iss has a slightly longer residence time at high latitudes .",
    "jem - euso can achieve in general a nearly constant exposure for the full range of zenith angles for which the arrival direction analysis will be performed .",
    "this is one of the advantageous features of space - based observation , as only small correction factors are needed .",
    "the convolution of observational duty cycle @xmath46 @xmath620% , cloud efficiency @xmath47 @xmath672% and effect of local light @xmath48 @xmath610% gives an overall conversion factor from geometric aperture to exposure of about @xmath613% with slight variations depending on the cuts applied to the different terms .",
    "this is due to the particular features of observation from space : a ) the possibility of operating in the presence of some diffuse moonlight up to 68% of the time , and b ) the possibility of measuring in a substantial fraction of the solid angle acceptance even in presence of low- or middle- altitude clouds .",
    "as an example , the distribution of cloud occurrence around the location of auger has been compared to the iss case by using tovs data though with statistical errors @xmath49 .",
    "results show that , despite a significantly higher fraction of clear atmosphere at auger site ( @xmath50 ) compared to the world average ( day and night ) spanned by the iss ( @xmath51 ) , when the fraction of time in which the cloud - top is located below 3.2  km is added to the clear atmosphere , both auger and iss orbit give similar results ( @xmath52 ) . for space - based observation",
    "this is the factor that should be compared with the clear atmosphere fraction of a ground - based observatory .",
    "our results are in agreement with those obtained by @xcite for the observational duty cycle .",
    "our result is slightly higher than what has been reported in @xcite for the owl observatory mainly due to the fact that owl will fly at higher altitudes ( @xmath6 1000  km ) , reducing the duty factor for full darkness by about 15%20% due to the shorter nighttime .",
    "moreover , in our estimation we have taken into account the possibility of accepting some moonlight as long as the total diffuse light is less than 1500 photons m@xmath36  ns@xmath37  sr@xmath37 .",
    "concerning clouds , our efficiency is a factor of @xmath53 times larger than @xcite essentially due to the fact that the cut on @xmath25 is applied only to optically thick clouds .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that thin clouds might distort the shower profile but not affect the arrival direction of the primary particle and therefore may be used to perform anisotropy analyses .    even though it is not considered in the present analysis , it is interesting to observe that optically thick clouds ( @xmath54 ) , located at low altitudes , may play another positive role , which is blocking the anthropogenic light and , therefore , allowing eas measurement also in regions typically polluted by city light .",
    "our results do not support the conclusions in @xcite , where it was claimed that the sensitivity of space - based fluorescence detectors is of unacceptably small level . in that approach ,",
    "only cloud - free scenes are considered and we know from section  [ sec : clouds ] that they account for only 1/3 of the time . moreover ,",
    "very strict conditions were applied on the extension of the cloud - free area . as an example , no correlation on the altitude of the possibly cloudy pixel and location of the track was applied .",
    "this tends to reject very inclined events with much longer paths in atmosphere even though all the detectable part of the track is located above clouds .",
    "it is clear that these constraints severely reduce the overall efficiency .",
    "the authors commented that less rigorous constraints could increase the cloud - free efficiency by even a factor of 3 .",
    "finally , as previously mentioned , simulations have proved @xcite the feasibility of reconstructing eas with reasonable uncertainty in presence of clouds .",
    "it is important to stress that the am system will have an important role in monitoring the atmospheric conditions in which eas develop , together with information from satellites , ground - based observations and meteorological models .",
    "we are , therefore , confident that it will be possible to characterize the atmospheric conditions in which each eass has been detected , and , account for these conditions in the data analyses . finally , it has to be mentioned that most of the above problems are related to the estimation of the energy and @xmath55 of the eas . the estimation of the exposure is more easily assessed and does not depend strongly on the level of accuracy of the eas reconstructed parameters .",
    "the present results indicate that jem - euso has the potential to reach an annual exposure of nearly one order of magnitude higher than auger at energies around 10@xmath56  ev .",
    "however , a final assessment of the annual exposure requires an evaluation of event selection efficiency to ensure the quality of the reconstructed eass in terms of energy , angular resolution , and @xmath55 .",
    "this will be described in detail in a forthcoming paper .",
    "preliminary results ( see @xcite ) , assuming clear atmosphere indicate that this condition is satisfied by most of the events .",
    "it is possible that the full data sample will be subdivided in sub - samples of data peculiar for each analysis . as an example ,",
    "those events reconstructed in thin cloud conditions are still most probably usable for the anisotropy analyses , granted that a lower limit on the energy of the event is assigned with high confidence . moreover",
    ", the possibility of defining a sample of events detected in ` golden conditions ' such as inclined eass in clear - atmosphere will guarantee a cross - check of the reliability of wider samples of events",
    ".    it will be possible to significantly increase the exposure by tilting the telescope . in the tilt mode ,",
    "the observation area is scaled by @xmath57 as a function of titling angle @xmath58 of the optical axis from the nadir .",
    "this will increase the sample at the highest energies and help to compensate the reduction of the observation area in case of periods of lower orbiting altitude .",
    "as an example , in case of @xmath59  km , tilting the instrument by @xmath60 would give an observation area similar to the case of @xmath61  km in nadir mode .",
    "at the same time , the observation in nadir mode would extend by @xmath630% the lowest energies where the measurement would be feasible .",
    "the analyses in such ` quasi - nadir mode ' in which the optical axis is tilted by @xmath62 , can be easily assimilated to the nadir one . in case of even larger tilting angles ( @xmath63 ) ,",
    "a dedicated study is necessary to evaluate the performance .",
    "this will be addressed in future .",
    "we wish also to point out that jem - euso has considerably improved with respect to the original extreme universe space observatory @xcite that successfully completed phase - a study within esa .",
    "the main improvements can be ascribed to the baseline optics of the jem - euso telescope @xcite ( with @xmath61.5 better focusing capability ) , to the fs detector @xcite ( @xmath61.6 higher detection efficiency ) , to the better geometrical layout of pdms on the fs that maximizes the filling factor @xcite , and to the improved performance of the electronics @xcite , which allow more complex trigger algorithms @xcite .",
    "the most important factors which determine the annual exposure of jem - euso mission have been reviewed .",
    "the analytical calculations indicate that the operational duty cycle of jem - euso , or the fraction of time in which the eas measurement is not hampered by the brightness of the atmosphere , is of the order of @xmath46 @xmath620% .",
    "the local light such as city light , atmospheric flashes and auroras will reduce the effective instantaneous observational area to @xmath64 of the geometrical area .",
    "the role of clouds has been thoroughly investigated and the cloud efficiency , defined as the ratio of the effective average aperture to the geometrical aperture , is found to be @xmath47 @xmath672% .",
    "all the above factors give an overall conversion factor from geometric aperture to exposure of about @xmath613% .",
    "simulations show that jem - euso can reach almost full efficiency at energies around @xmath65  ev for a restricted subset of events , and for the full aperture at energies @xmath66  ev .",
    "the expected annual exposure of jem - euso around 10@xmath56  ev is equivalent to about 9 years exposure of auger .",
    "this value has to be presented as the potential of jem - euso in nadir mode .",
    "a study of the selection efficiency of events due to quality cuts on reconstruction in clear and cloudy conditions will be performed in future to refine these results .",
