    "direct observational information on the most abundant interstellar molecule in the universe , molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath0 ) , is difficult to obtain . in diffuse interstellar gas",
    ", h@xmath0 can be studied directly by way of far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) absorption spectroscopy in its electronic lyman and werner bands in the wavelength regime between @xmath12 and @xmath13  toward uv - bright background sources , such as early type stars , supernovae , quasars ( qsos ) and active galactic nuclei ( agns ) . in the low - redshift universe , this bandpass is accessible only with space - based instrumentation .",
    "previous fuv satellites , such as _ copernicus _ and orfeus , observed only very nearby stars and a few selected distant objects .",
    "an overall assessment of the h@xmath0 content of the diffuse ism outside the milky way disk and the magellanic clouds was not possible before 1999 , when the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ ( fuse ) was launched .",
    "the high sensitivity of fuse allows observations of h@xmath0 absorption in regions outside the milky way disk towards a large number of extragalactic background sources .",
    "such observations reveal the abundance and properties of diffuse molecular gas in a variety of different environments .",
    "particularly promising regions for studies of h@xmath0 are the milky way halo and its neutral gas clouds that move with intermediate ( @xmath14 kms@xmath15 ; ivcs ) and high ( @xmath16 kms@xmath15 ; hvcs ) radial velocities several kiloparsecs above the galactic plane .",
    "recent studies with fuse and the _ space telescope imaging spectrograph _ ( stis ) have shown that the chemical composition of these clouds is not uniform , with metallicities varying between @xmath17 and @xmath18 solar ( wakker et al.1999 ; richter et al.2001a , 2001b ; lu et al.1998 ; gibson et al.2000 , 2001 ; wakker 2001 ) .",
    "the results imply a separation into three different groups of galactic halo clouds : ( 1 ) gas that has been ejected out of the milky way disk by a `` galactic fountain '' ( shapiro & field 1976 ) or similar processes , having @xmath18 solar abundances .",
    "all of the ivcs probably fall into this category .",
    "( 2 ) gas that has been brought into the milky way halo due to tidal interactions with the magellanic clouds , having metallicities similar to that of the magellanic clouds ( @xmath19 solar for the magellanic stream ) . ( 3 ) low - metallcity gas ( @xmath17 solar abundances ) that is infalling into the galactic halo from intergalactic space ( e.g. , hvc complex c ) . because of the varying metal and dust content of ivcs and hvcs , and the reduced uv radiation field above the galactic plane , ivcs and hvcs may serve as important interstellar laboratories to study h@xmath0 formation- and dissociation processes under conditions that are also found in more distant regions of the universe ( e.g. , in intergalactic ly@xmath20 absorbers ) for which detailed h@xmath0 absorption spectroscopy is often impossible .",
    "except for some ivcs that are close to the disk ( the draco cloud - mebold et al.1985 , and iv21 - weiss et al.1999 , heithausen et al.2001 ) , no co emission or absorption has been detected in galactic halo clouds so far .",
    "h@xmath0 was found for the first time in hvc gas ( richter et al.1999 ) and ivc gas ( gringel et al.2000 ) in data of the orfeus satellite , followed by further detections with fuse ( sembach et al.2001a ; richter et al.2001a ) . in a previous paper ( richter et al.2001c ) ,",
    "we studied h@xmath0 absorption in two prominent metal - poor hvcs , the magellanic stream and complex c. while h@xmath0 is clearly detected in the magellanic stream ( see also sembach et al.2001a ) , there is no evidence for the presence of h@xmath0 in the metal- and dust - poor complex c ( richter et al.2001b ) .",
    "this implies that the formation and maintainance of diffuse h@xmath0 in halo clouds is tightly correlated to the availability of interstellar dust grains , on whose surface the h@xmath0 formation proceeds most efficiently ( see , e.g. , shull & beckwith 1982 ) .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the distribution of h@xmath0 in ivcs toward 56 background sources .",
    "the data sample nearly all of the most prominent , large ivcs located predominantly in the northern galactic sky .",
    "these ivcs are : the intermediate - velocity arch ( iv arch ) , the low - latitude intermediate - velocity arch ( lliv arch ) , and the intermediate - velocity spur ( iv spur ) in the northern galactic sky , and complex gp and the pegasus - pisces arch ( pp arch ) in the southern sky .",
    "as summarized by wakker ( 2001 ) , all of these ivcs are known to have roughly solar , or slightly sub - solar metallicities , and are located between @xmath21 and @xmath22 kpc away from the galactic plane ; thus they are in the `` lower '' galactic halo .",
    "distance brackets for ivcs are derived by comparing ivc absorption line detections and non - detections toward stars at known distances and @xmath23-heights ( see wakker 2001 for details ) .    in figure 1",
    "we show the negative velocity hi ivc sky based on 21 cm data from the leiden - dwingeloo survey ( lds ; hartmann & burton 1997 ) at hi column densities @xmath24hi@xmath25 @xmath2 .",
    "the various ivc complexes are identified and explained in detail by wakker ( 2001 ) .",
    "intermediate - velocity hi above this column density covers a significant portion of the sky ( @xmath26 percent for @xmath14 kms@xmath15 ) , but it is very likely that the sky - coverage is much higher for low - column density hi gas below the detection limit of the 21 cm observations .",
    "the high sky coverage of ivc gas in the halo or disk - halo interface underlines the importance of the ivc phenomenon to an understanding of the ism of the milky way , although there do not exist many systematic studies of ivcs in the literature . as pointed out by kulkarni & fich ( 1985 ) , ivcs actually contain much of the kinetic energy of the total galactic ism .",
    "moreover , ivcs appear to have a mass circulation rate much higher than the hvcs , and high enough to produce the ovi seen in the thick galactic disk , if the ivcs represent the return flow of a galactic fountain ( see savage et al.2002 ) .",
    "some of the ivcs have been studied in detail using fuse absorption line data ( lliv arch , richter et al.2001a ; iv arch , richter et al.2001b ) .",
    "the elemental depletion pattern observed in ivcs implies that these clouds contain dust grains , but the surface properties of these grains , important for the h@xmath0 formation , are unknown . with respect to their velocities , abundances , and distances",
    ", it appears likely that ivcs represent the cooled return flow of a galactic fountain ( shapiro & field 1976 ) .",
    "one of our sight lines ( mrk876 ) samples the draco cloud ( @xmath27 kpc ) , one of the two ivcs at lower @xmath23 that is known to contain co. it is not yet clear whether the draco cloud falls into the same class of objects as the other ivcs cited above ( possibly , as a final stage of the galactic fountain process ) , or whether it represents a galactic molecular cloud at unusually high galactic latitudes and @xmath23-height .",
    "our fuse data also sample a variety of other small ivcs in the northern and southern galactic sky .",
    "distances and metallicities for these ivcs are unknown , but we have formally included these clouds in our sample , based on criteria that are described in  4 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in  2 we discuss the fuse observations and the data handling . in ",
    "3 we analyze in detail molecular hydrogen absorption in the iv arch in the fuse spectrum of the quasar pg1351 + 640 . in  4 we present a survey of h@xmath0 in ivcs toward 56 ( mostly extragalactic ) background sources .",
    "a comparison between the h@xmath0 and the hi sky at intermediate velocities is given in  5 .",
    "in  6 and  7 we investigate the origin and physical conditions of the diffuse molecular gas in the lower halo . a discussion of our observations is presented in  8 .",
    "we summarize our study in  9 .",
    "in this paper we are making use of fuse absorption line data of @xmath28 sources , predominantly extragalactic objects ( qsos , seyferts , galaxies , bllacs ) , as well as two distant ( @xmath29 kpc ) galactic halo stars .",
    "this data is available from the fuse survey of interstellar ovi in the thick disk of the milky way and in high - velocity clouds ( wakker et al.2002 ; savage et al.2002 ; sembach et al.2002 ) .",
    "a detailed description of the fuse data and the analysis method is provided by wakker et al.(2002 ) .",
    "we briefly summarize the observations and the data reduction process .",
    "the fuse spectra were collected in the time between november 1999 and december 2001 as part of various principal - investigator ( pi ) projects and guest - investigator ( gi ) projects .",
    "fuse is equipped with four co - aligned prime - focus telescopes , rowland - type spectrographs , and two microchannel plate detectors , in total covering the wavelength range from 905 to 1187  .",
    "four independent channels are available , two having a al+lif coatings ( for @xmath30  ) and two having sic surfaces ( @xmath31  ) . there are three entrance apertures , lwrs ( @xmath32 ) , mdrs ( @xmath33 ) , and hirs ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "details about the instrument and its in - orbit performance can be found in moos et al.(2000 ) and sahnow et al.(2000 ) .",
    "most of the data that is used here were recorded through the large aperture ( lwrs ) and in the photon - address mode , in which the x / y location , the arrival time , and the pulse height of each detection are stored in a photon list .",
    "all spectra have been reduced using the calfuse standard pipeline ( v1.8.7 ) that corrects for detector backgrounds , spacecraft orbital motions , and geometrical distortions ( sahnow et al.2000 ) .",
    "a wavelength calibration was made for each individual spectrum by adjusting various atomic lines ( e.g. , siii @xmath35 , ari @xmath36 ) and molecular hydrogen lines to match the distribution of hi emission along each sight line ( see wakker et al.2002 ) on the lsr velocity scale .",
    "we estimate an accuracy of @xmath37 kms@xmath15 for the velocity calibration .",
    "the spectral resolution of the fuse data is @xmath38 kms@xmath15 , with slight variations ( @xmath39 kms@xmath15 ) within the data set .",
    "the fluxes of our background sources vary between @xmath40 and @xmath41 erg@xmath2s@xmath15@xmath15 ( see wakker et al.2002 ) .",
    "only a fraction of the entire data set ( @xmath42 percent ) can actually be used to study interstellar absorption in the halo at a sufficient continuum flux .",
    "the data for each sight line were rebinned in an appropriate manner in order to improve the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) . for the spectra that are actually used to study ivc h@xmath0 absorption in this study ( 56 spectra ) , bin sizes range between 3 and 10 pixels , corresponding to @xmath43 to @xmath38 kms@xmath15 .",
    "the s / n in the data varies between 3 and 30 ( these values represent the s / n per resolution element ; see also wakker et al.2002 ) .",
    "continua were fitted using low - order polynomials .",
    "most of the continua are relatively flat , reflecting the smooth nature of the uv spectrum of qsos and other extragalactic background sources . in some cases , emission that is associated with the background object",
    "complicates the continuum placement , but the corresponding continuum variations arise on a scale that is much larger than that of the interstellar absorption lines . for these cases ,",
    "the continuum was fitted locally in the vicinity of each line .",
    "equivalent widths were measured by fitting multi - component gaussian line profiles to the data .",
    "this method is particulary helpful to reproduce a multi - component absorption in a spectrum with low s / n and larger bin sizes .",
    "equivalent width errors are based on photon statistics and contiuum placement errors .",
    "in this section we present a detailed description and discussion of h@xmath0 absorption in the intermediate - velocity arch ( iv arch ) in the fuse spectrum of the quasar pg1351 + 640 , which represents the best example of molecular absorption in intermediate - velocity halo gas . for most of the other sight lines",
    "presented later , such a detailed study is not possible due to the lower data quality and the less pronounced nature of the h@xmath0 absorption .",
    "this section , however , may serve as an introduction to the general analysis method that we will also use for the other sight lines discussed in  4 .",
    "figure 2 presents the sight - line structure towards pg1351 + 640 , as seen in effelsberg hi 21 cm emission data ( top panel , from wakker et al.2001 ) and in atomic absorption from pii @xmath44 , siii @xmath35 , and feii @xmath45 ( lower three panels ) from fuse data , plotted on a lsr radial velocity scale .",
    "the main emission and absorption components include : ( 1 ) local milky way gas near @xmath46 kms@xmath15 , ( 2 ) the iv arch seen near @xmath47 kms@xmath15 , and ( 3 ) hvc complex c at @xmath48 kms@xmath15 .",
    "detailed maps of 21 cm emission in the iv arch and complex c can be found in kuntz & danly ( 1996 ) and wakker ( 2001 ) .",
    "as the hi emission profile shows , all three major components have substructure , for instance a weak second ivc component near @xmath49 kms@xmath15 , which is also seen in atomic absorption .",
    "the effelsberg data yield hi column densities of @xmath50 @xmath2 for the main ivc component at @xmath47 kms@xmath15 , and @xmath51 @xmath2 for the weaker component at @xmath49 kms@xmath15 .",
    "the @xmath47 kms@xmath15 component is associated with the iv19 core ( see kuntz & danly 1996 ) , while the @xmath49 kms@xmath15 component is part of core iv9 .",
    "h@xmath0 absorption in the iv arch toward pg1351 + 640 is found in 29 lines in rotational levels @xmath52 to @xmath53 at a radial velocity of @xmath54 kms@xmath15 , representing the main ivc component along this sight line ( see above ) .",
    "absorption is evident in the weaker @xmath49 kms@xmath15 component ; see also table 2 . ]",
    "figure 3 presents a portion of the fuse spectrum of pg1351 + 640 in the wavelength region of the h@xmath0 lyman @xmath55 band , together with a two - component gaussian fit of the data .",
    "figure 4 shows a selection of velocity profiles for the rotational ground states @xmath52 and @xmath56 .",
    "similary , figure 5 presents velocity profiles for the excited rotational levels @xmath57 and @xmath53 . clearly , h@xmath0 absorption near @xmath47 kms@xmath15 is present at moderate strength in all of the lines shown , whereas h@xmath0 absorption from the local galactic disk gas is seen near @xmath46 kms@xmath15 .",
    "we have measured equivalent widths for the h@xmath0 absorption in the iv arch ( table1 ) and have fitted the data to curves of growth for each individual rotational level , @xmath58 , deriving logarithmic column densities , log @xmath59 . for @xmath52 ,",
    "the data fits best on a curve of growth with a very low doppler parameter of @xmath60 kms@xmath15 ( figure 6 ) , implying that the h@xmath0 gas in the rotational ground state resides in a very confined region in the iv arch that has a very low velocity dispersion . for @xmath61 and @xmath53",
    ", we find @xmath62 kms@xmath15 , possibly indicating that the excited molecular hydrogen gas is situated in a less confined region .",
    "the different @xmath63 values may reflect a core - envelope structure of the h@xmath0 , in which the more turbulent gas in the outer parts is rotationally excited , whereas the inner , less turbulent part of the h@xmath0 gas remains mostly in the rotational ground state .",
    "however , the interpretation of the @xmath52 data points in figure 6 is difficult , since the lower @xmath63 value for the rotational ground state is determined mainly by the r(0 ) line with the lowest @xmath6-value ( r(0),0 - 0 @xmath64 ; see table1 ) . if the equivalent width of this line is overestimated by @xmath65 ( e.g. , due to a noise peak or an unidentified intergalactic absorption feature ) , the data points for @xmath52 would also fit the curve of growth for the @xmath66 lines with @xmath67 kms@xmath15 , and the h@xmath0 column density for @xmath52 would be lower .",
    "this seems somewhat unrealistic though , because the @xmath68 ratio ( already quite low with the two different @xmath63 values ) would further decrease , and the h@xmath0 column density distribution for @xmath52 and @xmath56 could not be fitted by an excitation temperature that would be consistent with the relatively low value for log @xmath69 ( see figure 7 ) .",
    "thus , we adopt the two different @xmath63 values for @xmath52 and @xmath66 in the following discussions , but note that more precise data are required to improve the determination of @xmath63 for @xmath52 .    individual column densities , log @xmath59 , based on the two different @xmath63 values for @xmath52 and @xmath66 given above , are listed in table1",
    ". the total h@xmath0 column density , log @xmath24h@xmath70 , is @xmath71 ( @xmath72 error ) , and the fraction of hydrogen in molecular form is log @xmath73 log @xmath74h@xmath75(hi@xmath76h@xmath77=-3.3 $ ] , based on the hi 21 cm data from effelsberg .",
    "we have derived excitation temperatures for the h@xmath0 gas by fitting the h@xmath0 rotational level population to a theoretical boltzmann distribution ( figure 7 ) .",
    "we find an excitation temperature , @xmath78 , of @xmath79 k for @xmath52 and @xmath56 , possibly representing an upper limit for the kinetic temperature of the gas in the interior of the cloud .",
    "the temperature in the inner core of the cloud could be lower , if part of the h@xmath0 gas with @xmath80 resides in a more extended region than the @xmath52 gas , as implied by the slightly higher @xmath63 value for @xmath80 .",
    "for @xmath81 and @xmath82 ( upper limit ) we find @xmath83 k. this high excitation temperature probably reflects several competing processes , such as uv pumping and h@xmath0 formation pumping ( see shull & beckwith 1982 ) .",
    "the column density ratios @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 can be used to disentangle the various excitation mechanisms to a certain degree ( e.g. , browing , tumlinson & shull 2002 ) , but such an interpretation is difficult if information on the higher rotational levels is limited . in view of the uncertainties for @xmath69 and @xmath87 , and the fact that no h@xmath0 is detected for @xmath88 and @xmath89 we therefore refrain from a more detailed analysis of the rotational excitation of the ivc h@xmath0 gas toward pg1351 + 640 .",
    "the total h@xmath0 column density in the iv arch towards pg1351 + 640 , log @xmath90 , is the highest that has been reported for intermediate - velocity clouds so far .",
    "this is not surprising , however , since the line of sight to pg1351 + 640 passes through the iv arch in a region with an hi column density of log @xmath91 , which is substantially higher than in other directions for which h@xmath0 absorption in ivcs was measured before ( e.g. , gringel et al.2000 ; richter et al.2001a , 2001b ) .",
    "from a measurement of several atomic absorption lines of feii , siii , and pii in the pg1351 + 640 spectrum we find atomic column densities of log @xmath92(feii)@xmath93 , log @xmath92(siii)@xmath94 , and log @xmath92(pii)@xmath95 for the iv19 component at @xmath47 kms@xmath15 . together with the hi column density of log @xmath91 from the 21 cm data we derive logarithmic gas - phase abundances , [ @xmath96/h ] = log(@xmath97log(@xmath96/h)@xmath98 , of [ fe / h]@xmath99 , [ si / h]@xmath99 , and [ p / h]@xmath100 ( the values for log(@xmath96/h)@xmath98 are from anders & grevesse 1989 ; grevesse & noels 1993 ) . thus , the fuse and the hi 21 cm data imply that iv19 has a nearly solar abundance ( as sampled by p ) , similar to what is found for the iv arch in the direction of pg1259 + 593 ( richter et al.2001b ) . fe and si",
    "appear to be under - abundant , possibly due to depletion into dust grains , on whose surface the h@xmath0 formation is taking place .",
    "it is important to note that this abundance determination is based on a beam - smeared hi column density .",
    "if substantial sub - structure exists within the effelsberg beam ( @xmath3 arcmin ) , as possibly implied by the existence of h@xmath0 , the abundances cited above might be incorrect .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath63-value for the atomic absorption is rather high ( @xmath101 kms@xmath15 ) , indicating that the h@xmath0 indeed resides only in the inner - most region of iv19 , surrounded by a much larger envelope ( with a higher velocity dispersion ) in which the bulk of the neutral gas is situated .",
    "no h@xmath0 absorption is seen in the complex c component at @xmath48 kms@xmath15 , giving further observational evidence that this metal - poor hvc is not able to form and maintain diffuse molecular hydrogen ( see richter et al.2001c ) .",
    "we estimate an upper limit of log @xmath102 ( @xmath103 ) for the total h@xmath0 column density in complex c toward pg1351 + 640 .",
    "this limit is consistent with previous h@xmath0 measurements in complex c ( murphy et al.2000 ; richter et al.2001c ; collins , shull , & giroux 2002 ) .",
    "only a few cases of h@xmath0 absorption in ivcs have been reported in the literature ( gringel et al.2000 ; richter et al.2001a , 2001b ; bluhm et al.2001 ) , and thus very little is known about the overall extent of molecular gas in intermediate - velocity clouds .",
    "previous detections include the iv arch , the lliv arch , and the ivc in front of the lmc .",
    "column densities and molecular gas fractions derived from these studies are lower than those found in the iv arch towards pg1351 + 640 , with logarithmic column densities between @xmath104 to @xmath105 and molecular hydrogen fractions , log @xmath6 , between @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "all h@xmath0 measurements so far imply a diffuse molecular gas phase in ivcs .    to learn more about the distribution of diffuse molecular hydrogen in ivcs and the physical conditions of the gas in which the h@xmath0 resides , we have searched for h@xmath0 absorption with fuse in intermediate - velocity clouds towards @xmath28 extragalactic backgound sources , such as quasars and active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , as well as two distant halo stars .",
    "this data is available from the survey of ovi absorption in the thick disk of the milky way , as described by savage et al.(2002 ) and wakker et al.(2002 ) .",
    "it is important to note that this data set is inhomogeneous with respect to sky - coverage , signal - to - noise ( s / n ) , and overall data quality .",
    "most of the background sources are located in the northern galactic sky , giving access to the large northern ivc complexes , such as the iv arch and the lliv arch . as described in  2 ,",
    "only a small fraction of the suitable backgound sources observed with fuse can actually be used to study interstellar absorption in ivcs due to the flux limitations of these objects . from the available sight lines ,",
    "56 have fuse data with a s / n sufficient to study interstellar h@xmath0 absorption , and are known to pass intermediate - velocity hi halo gas at @xmath108 , @xmath109 kms@xmath15 , and log @xmath92(hi)@xmath110 .",
    "44 of these are located in the northern galactic sky , 12 in the south .",
    "table 2 lists the 56 background sources and their coordinates together with the ivc velocities and ivc hi column densities .",
    "ivc identifications have been adopted from wakker ( 2001 ) .",
    "hi 21 cm emission line data for these directions is available from the leiden - dwingeloo survey ( hartmann & burton 1997 ) , the effelsberg 100 m telescope ( wakker et al.2001 ) , the green bank 140 ft telescope ( murphy et al.1996 ) , and the villa elisa observatory ( arnal et al.2000 ) .",

    "two sightlines ( pks0558 - 504 and ngc1705 ; formally included in table 2 ) show hi 21 cm ivc emission in three components that have no counterparts in any atomic absorption line in the fuse spectrum ; these emission features are probably caused by hi beam smearing effects and/or radio base - line calibration errors",
    ". we do not consider these cases any further . in summary ,",
    "the fuse data set consists of 61 convincingly detected hi ivc components at log @xmath92(hi)@xmath110 that are also detected in fuv metal - line absorption .",
    "we consider h@xmath0 absorption in these ivc components in the following paragraphs .",
    "a s / n of @xmath3 ( per resolution element ) is typically required to identify ivc h@xmath0 absorption in individual lines at equivalent widths of @xmath113 m .",
    "generally , a clear identification is easier , if the ivc component is well separated from the local galactic gas ( i.e. , at velocities @xmath113 kms@xmath15 ) . for one case ( mrk9 ; see table2 ) , the local galactic h@xmath0 absorption is so strong , that it totally overlaps possible @xmath114 h@xmath0 absorption at intermediate velocities , so little can be said about ivc h@xmath0 absorption in this particular case .",
    "together with the varying strength of local galactic h@xmath0 absorption and the resulting difficulty of separating intermediate - velocity components at varying s / n from the local galactic component , the detection limits for h@xmath0 absorption at intermediate velocities vary typically between @xmath115 and @xmath116 m . note that the s / n and the @xmath103 detection limit may vary considerably within a spectrum due to flux variations and instrumental effects ( e.g. , fixed - pattern noise , blending problems , varying exposure times for different detector segments ) . out of 29 ivc components in fuse spectra that have relatively good s /",

    "h@xmath0 absorption in the iv arch has also been reported for the line of sight toward hd93521 , using orfeus data ( gringel et al.2000 ) ; this sight - line has been included in table 2 .",

    "h@xmath0 equivalent widths for the 10 previously unpublished ivc components",
    "are given in table 3 .",
    "we list six equivalent widths per ivc component , representing the most pronounced ivc h@xmath0 features for each case .",

    "the fact that no correlation is seen implies that the h@xmath0 absorption comes from low - column density h@xmath0 aborbers without self shielding , while the scatter could be due to the varying number of h@xmath0 absorbers per sight line .",

    "it is interesting that all of the detected h@xmath0 ivc components have low molecular hydrogen fractions with log @xmath144 .",
    "this suggests that for the many upper limits with log @xmath145 there is a substantial number of ivc components that have molecular material at h@xmath0 fractions that are undetectable at the current s / n of the fuse data . from the @xmath146 data points with log @xmath147",
    "there are @xmath148 positive detections , @xmath82 possible detections , and @xmath149 non - detections .",

    "logarithmic molecular hydrogen fraction is @xmath151 .",
    "to understand the presence of molecular hydrogen in ivcs and its role for the interstellar gas in the lower milky way halo it is important to consider possible formation sites of the h@xmath0 .",
    "although it may be possible that molecular cloud complexes are pushed out of the disk of the milky way by energetic events ( see leass et al.2002 , in preparation ) , it appears very unlikely ( and there is no observational evidence ) that entire molecular clouds are transported several kiloparsecs above the milky way disk , and that the observed h@xmath0 represents a diffuse remnant from dense molecular clouds that have been elevated from the disk into the halo .",
    "two noticable exceptions may be the draco cloud and iv21 ( see above ) , which have been detected in co emission , but these ivcs are located in the disk - halo interface ( @xmath152 pc ) and they may well be `` normal '' molecular clouds at exceptionally large @xmath23-heights . also , the presence of dust and heavy elements in halo clouds that contain h@xmath0 implies that the observed molecular gas phase is not sampling any primordial molecular gas clumps in the halo that have been proposed in the literature as candidates for baryonic dark matter ( e.g. , de paolis et al.1995 , kalberla , shchekinov & dettmar 1999 ) .",
    "the roughly solar abundances that are found in ivcs instead suggests that this gas represents galactic disk material that is somehow circulating from the disk into the halo and back , possibly by way of a galactic fountain ( shapiro & field 1976 ) . in this model ,",
    "gas ejected out of the disk by way of supernova explosions cools and falls back onto the milky way disk .",
    "similar processes are probably also seen in other galaxies .",
    "for instance , the many extraplanar dust filaments observed in edge - on galaxies such as ngc891 ( howk & savage 1997 ) suggest that fountain - type processes may be a rather common phenomenon in spiral galaxies .",
    "the existence of diffuse h@xmath0 at relatively low molecular hydrogen fractions implies that the h@xmath0 line self shielding ( see , e.g. , draine & bertoldi 1996 ) is probably not very efficient in such gas . without the self shielding , however , the photo - dissociation time scales are quite short ( @xmath153 years ) , and no diffuse molecular material should be detectable , unless the dissociation is counteracted by local h@xmath0 _",
    "formation_. following this logic , the widespread existence of h@xmath0 in ivcs strongly suggests that molecule formation takes place _ in situ _ in the most dense regions of ivcs .",
    "it has been proposed that halo clouds consist of a multiphase structure ( wakker & schwarz 1991 ; wolfire et al.1995 ) with cold , dense cores ( `` cold neutral medium '' , cnm ) embedded in a more tenuous , warm medium ( `` warm neutral medium '' , wnm ) .",
    "most likley , the diffuse molecular hydrogen forms in small , dense filaments during the cooling and fragmentation phase of a galactic fountain , and traces the cnm in the intermediate - velocity clouds .",
    "houck & bregman ( 1990 ) have developed a model for low - temperature fountains with a cooling timescale , @xmath154 , of @xmath155 yr , and a time scale for newly formed clouds to return to the disk , @xmath156 , on the order of @xmath157 yr .",
    "this gives the cnm sufficient time to form h@xmath0 at moderate densities to the fractional level that is observed ( see  7.2 ) .",
    "since dust is available in ivcs , we assume that the h@xmath0 formation takes place on the surfaces of dust grains , the most efficient way to form molecular hydrogen",
    ". one might argue that the grain formation rate in the halo must be significantly lower than in the disk due to the highly energetic processes operating that might destroy or at least modify the properties of the dust grains .",
    "the results of sembach & savage ( 1996 ) in fact indicate that the surfaces of grains in halo clouds are probably different from those in diffuse disk clouds , but the implications for the halo h@xmath0 grain formation rate are unclear .",
    "franco et al.(1991 ) have presented the idea of a `` soft '' galactic fountain .",
    "they propose that dust grains might be transported into the halo due to radiation pressure of starlight near regions of intense star formation .",
    "it is shown that this `` photolevitation '' may push small diffuse clouds above the disk , whereas massive molecular clouds would not be affected by the momentum transfer from the radiation field .",
    "such a process may only mildly modify the dust properties and could well explain the widespread presence of dust and molecular hydrogen in the lower galactic halo .",
    "franco et al .",
    "find that the photolevitation effect can maintain a neutral gas column density of @xmath158 @xmath2 above the disk , similar to what is found for most of the ivcs .",
    "the overall ubiquity of h@xmath0 in ivcs is indicating that these clouds must contain substructure , providing small , relatively dense cloudlets and filaments that allow h@xmath0 to form at a rapid enough rate to compensate for the destruction by uv photo - dissociation . in the following ,",
    "we will investigate densities and typical dimensions of the structures in which the h@xmath0 may reside by discussing the processes and parameters that balance the formation and dissociation of molecular hydrogen in galactic halo clouds .    since dust is present in ivcs ( see richter et al.2001a , 2001b ) , we consider h@xmath0 dust grain formation as the dominating h@xmath0 formation process in ivcs and ignore any gas phase reactions ( see black 1978 ) .      in an h@xmath0 formation - dissociation equilibrium in transparent clouds , the h@xmath0 volume density , @xmath159(h@xmath0 ) ,",
    "is related to the hi volume density , @xmath159(hi ) , via @xmath160 + where at low molecular hydrogen fractions @xmath161(hi )",
    "@xmath162(h@xmath0)@xmath163(hi ) in @xmath11 ( spitzer 1978 , hereafter s78 ) . in this equation , @xmath164 is the probability that the molecule is dissociated after photo absorption , @xmath165 is the photo - absorption rate per second , and @xmath166 is the h@xmath0 formation rate in units @xmath167s@xmath15 .",
    "the h@xmath0 photo - absorption rate @xmath165 in the galactic halo depends on the mean fuv radiation field at a height @xmath23 above the galactic plane .",
    "principally , the fuv radiation field is expected to be lower in the milky way halo in comparison to the disk , and various attempts have been made to find scaling relations for the radiation field in the halo as function of the @xmath23-height ( e.g. , wolfire et al.1995 ) .",
    "these studies show that only a fraction of the ultraviolet photons that are produced in the galactic disk ( mainly by ob stars ) escape into the halo , mainly due to the extinction by dust grains . for the lower galactic halo ,",
    "the @xmath23-dependence of uv field in the halo is small due to the large solid angle of the galactic plane . using equation ( 4 ) from wolfire et al.(1995 )",
    ", the fuv radiation field at a @xmath23-height of 1 kpc is reduced by a factor of @xmath168 in comparison to the midplane intensity .",
    "the h@xmath0 photo - absorption rate in the halo is expected to scale directly with the halo uv field and thus is reduced by a similar factor . in the disk , the mean value for @xmath165 is @xmath169 s@xmath15 ( s78 ) .",
    "we therefore assume that @xmath170 s@xmath15 at the outer edge of an ivc .",
    "h@xmath0 line self - shielding reduces the uv flux in the interior of a cloud once the h@xmath0 column density in a single absorbing component exceeds a critical value . following the approximation given by draine & bertoldi ( 1996 )",
    ", the h@xmath0 photo - absorption rate then is reduced by the factor @xmath171h@xmath172 @xmath173 for h@xmath0 column densites log @xmath24h@xmath174 .",
    "whether or not the h@xmath0 self - shielding is important for ivcs is unclear .",
    "the total h@xmath0 column densities measured in ivcs are log @xmath24h@xmath175 , implying that for single - component absorbers self shielding may reduce the photo - absorption rate in the innermost region down to a level of @xmath176 s@xmath15 .",
    "however , the relatively high @xmath63 values measured for most of these clouds ( table 4 ) imply that there are several absorbing cnm structures within an ivc contributing to the total h@xmath0 column density ( see also discussion in  5 ) , and h@xmath0 self - shielding probably plays therefore only a minor role .",
    "we will discuss situations with and without self - shielding at the end of this section .    because we assume that all of the h@xmath0 in ivcs forms on the surfaces of dust grains , the formation rate parameter @xmath166 given in equation ( 1 ) denotes the rate per neutral h atom to form h@xmath0 molecules by collisions with dust grains .",
    "@xmath166 is a function of the gas and dust temperature , the sticking coefficient of h atoms on the grain surface , the mean projected surface area of the dust grains , and the mean h volume density ( see s78 ) .",
    "the value for @xmath166 in galactic halo clouds is unknown , as there is little knowledge about the properties of dust grains away from the galactic disk . here",
    ", we simply assume that @xmath177 @xmath178s@xmath15 ( s78 ) due to the lack of better information .",
    "it is possible , however , that @xmath179 differs significantly from the value measured in the disk .",
    "one major problem that arises from equation ( 1 ) is that the formation - dissociation equlibrium relates the volume densities @xmath159 of hi and h@xmath0 with each other , while column densities @xmath92(hi ) and @xmath92(h@xmath0 ) are measured .",
    "it is often assumed that @xmath92(hi)/@xmath92(h@xmath0 ) @xmath180 @xmath159(hi)/@xmath159(h@xmath0 ) ( see s78 ) , but this assumption might be incorrect in the case of galactic halo clouds because they likely have a pronounced multi - phase structure and unresolved sub - components .",
    "it is expected that ivcs ( as well as hvcs ) consist of large gaseous envelopes that contain both ionized and atomic species , interacting with the hot galactic corona and residing in pressure equilibrium with the hot coronal gas ( spitzer 1956 ; sembach et al.2002 ) .",
    "most likely , the neutral and partly molecular cloud core that is associated with the cnm is embedded in a low density , higher temperature layer representing the wnm , but it is unknown in which phase the bulk of the gas is residing . in any case , the measured @xmath92(hi ) represents the _ total _ column density of neutral hydrogen along the line of sight , and all gas phases that contain neutral gas at whatever fraction will contribute to its value .",
    "thus , it appears not to be justified to simply compare @xmath92(hi ) and @xmath92(h@xmath0 ) in ivcs , since the h@xmath0 likely resides in regions much more confined than the hi , and only a fraction of the total hi is available for the formation of hydrogen molecules .",
    "the different gas phases ( we here assume just two phases : neutral - molecular and neutral - ionized ) should be treated separately , and a scaling factor for the hi column density in the ivcs is required .",
    "we define @xmath181 as an hi scaling factor @xmath182 , so that    @xmath183     + where `` f '' stands for the dense filament in the cnm in which the h@xmath0 gas resides , and @xmath92(hi ) is the total hi column density of the ivc measured along the line of sight ( _ not _ including other hi velocity components ) .",
    "note that the molecular hydrogen fractions listed in table 2 ( tenth column ) are derived in the standard way from the _ total _ ivc hi column densities given by the 21 cm observations .    using the values for @xmath165 and @xmath166 for the milky way halo ( as defined above ) and",
    "equation ( 2 ) , we find for the hydrogen volume density in the region of the ivc that contains the h@xmath0 :    @xmath184     + equation ( 3 ) allows us to determine the hydrogen volume density in the partly molecular cloud core of an ivc , assuming that the observed fraction of hydrogen in molecular form represents its abundance in formation - dissociation equilibrium .",
    "if we neglect h@xmath0 line self - shielding and take @xmath92(h@xmath0)/@xmath92(hi)@xmath185 , @xmath186 s@xmath15 , and @xmath187 as typical values , we derive a hydrogen volume density of @xmath188 @xmath11 by using equation ( 3 ) .",
    "if self - shielding is considered , the volume density is reduced by the factor @xmath189 and could be as low as @xmath190 @xmath11 . however ,",
    "if the cnm in ivcs is broken up into small column density filaments ( see above ) , volume densities of @xmath191 @xmath11 appear to be more realistic .",
    "for the somewhat stronger absorption in the iv arch towards pg1351 + 640 we have @xmath92(h@xmath0)/@xmath92(hi)@xmath192 ( see  3 ) , so that with @xmath187 and without self - shielding the hydrogen volume density comes out as high as @xmath193 @xmath11 . with self - shielding ,",
    "we obtain @xmath194@xmath195@xmath196 and @xmath197 @xmath11 .",
    "the actual value for @xmath198 probably lies somewhere in between , but without knowing the 3d structure of the h@xmath0 absorber it is difficult to estimate a more realistic value for the self - shielding factor @xmath189 .",
    "however , if we assume that the mean thermal pressure in the cnm in these clouds is similar to that in the disk ( @xmath199 @xmath11 k ; heiles 1997 ) , the rotational excitation temperature @xmath200 k derived in  3 implies @xmath201 @xmath11 .",
    "the linear thickness of such a cnm / h@xmath0 structure , @xmath202(hi)(@xmath203 , is small , @xmath17 pc typically .",
    "such a small filament is then probably surrounded by a low - density wnm envelope that has a much larger extent .",
    "evidence for filamentary sub - structure of ivcs also comes from high - resolution optical spectra ( ryans , sembach & keenan 1996 ; welty et al.1999 ) , in which multiple velocity components are detected in ivc gas separated only by a few kms@xmath15 . because of the close proximity of the components in velocity space it appears likely that they are physically related to each other ( i.e. , they are sub - components of the same ivc ) .    if ivcs are cooling and falling back onto the milky way disk ( as indicated by their radial velocities ) , the most dense gas conglomerates may be located relatively close ( @xmath204 kpc ) to the midplane , i.e. , in the disk - halo interface . at this stage ,",
    "some of the molecular filaments might have turned dense enough to allow the formation of much larger amounts of h@xmath0 , and possibly carbon monoxide ( co ) .",
    "interestingly , there are two ivcs known to exist in the disk - halo interface that are the _ only _ ivcs showing co emission : the draco cloud ( mebold et al.1985 ) and iv21 ( weiss et al.1999 ; heithausen et al.2001 ) .",
    "possibly , these two clouds represent the final stage of a galactic - fountain ivc before re - entering the milky way disk .",
    "we have shown at the end of the previous section the h@xmath0 observations in ivcs suggest the presence of a large number of small , relatively dense filaments in the lower milky way halo , assuming that h@xmath0 grain formation and photo - dissociation are equilibriated . in their best - fitting galactic fountain model ( model 3 ) ,",
    "houck & bregman ( 1990 ) suggest a number of @xmath205 halo clouds at a size of @xmath206 pc above a disk area of 1 kpc@xmath207 . assuming the thickness of typical h@xmath0 filaments is only @xmath17 pc",
    ", the relatively high detection rate of h@xmath0 absorption measured in ivcs in this study implies that the number of h@xmath0 bearing filaments per kpc@xmath207 column is several orders of magnitude higher .",
    "it is likely that the diffuse h@xmath0 gas traces the cnm in these clouds , and that this cnm is surprisingly widespread , given the high detection rate of h@xmath0 .",
    "we do not know , however , whether these structures already represent the highest density regions in ivcs , or whether more dense molecular clumps with higher molecular fractions exist .",
    "h@xmath0 absorption line measurements are naturally biased towards diffuse clouds with low molecular fractions and low densities due to their large volume filling factor .",
    "the chance to detect such a diffuse h@xmath0 absorber by way of absorption spectroscopy towards a limited number of background sources is much higher than to find a small , dense clump that would have a small angular extent .",
    "it has been demonstrated over the last few years that the ism consists of substantial small - scale structure at au scales ( e.g. , faison et al.1998 ; lauroesch , meyer & blades 2000 ) , indicating apparently ubiquitous tiny gaseous structures ( `` tiny - scale atomic structures '' , tsas ) with very high densities ( @xmath208@xmath11 ) .",
    "the tsas are probably filamentary and sheet like structures embedded in the cnm ( heiles 1997 ) , but very little is known about their physical properties .",
    "very recently , tiny - scale structure in the ism has also been found in co emission ( heithausen 2002 ) , showing that molecules may play an important role for the understanding of these structures .",
    "au scale structure is also present in ivcs , as demonstrated by nai observations of complex gp against the globular cluster m15 ( meyer & lauroesch 1999 ) . at such high volume densities ,",
    "those tiny structures in the halo should contain molecular hydrogen at a high fractional abundance , since the dissociating fuv field in the halo is not intense and the h@xmath0 formation time scale ( @xmath209 ) becomes short at high densities . for @xmath210 @xmath11",
    "the linear thickness would be 10 times smaller than for @xmath211 @xmath11 , if the hi column density stays constant .",
    "however , the surface filling factor would be down by a factor of 100 ( assuming spherical geometry ) .",
    "thus , it would require a larger sample of fuse sight lines to be able to detect and measure h@xmath0 absorption in these smallest structures , and to investigate the relation between the tsas and the more diffuse cnm phase in intermediate - velocity clouds .",
    "a possible candidate for molecular absorption related to tsas could be the intermediate- and high - velocity h@xmath0 gas towards lh58 in the large magellanic cloud ( richter , sembach & howk 2002 ; richter et al.1999 ) .",
    "our study reveals that diffuse molecular hydrogen is a widespread , but not very abundant constituent in intermediate - velocity clouds in the low galactic halo .",
    "the results suggest that the h@xmath0 in ivcs resides in a large number of small , relatively dense filaments , associated with the cnm in these clouds .",
    "the ubiquity of h@xmath0 in ivcs underlines that molecular hydrogen is able to form and survive in regions that have low hi column densities , tracing the most dense regions in the diffuse interstellar medium . a key point for the formation and survival of h@xmath0 in ivcs",
    "is that these clouds contain heavy elements and dust grains , on which h@xmath0 formation proceeds very efficiently .",
    "moreover , the fuv radiation field in ivcs is relatively low , reducing the uv photo - dissociation of h@xmath0 .",
    "that the presence of dust and the absence of a strong uv field is so important for the existence of diffuse interstellar h@xmath0 becomes immediately clear when comparing our findings with observations of h@xmath0 in other environments .",
    "for the magellanic clouds , richter ( 2000 ) and tumlinson et al.(2002 ) find that the average molecular hydrogen fraction is significantly lower than in the milky way , mainly because of the very strong uv radiation from the many young ob stars in the clouds , and due to the lower dust abundance . in the magellanic stream , sembach et al.(2001a ) and",
    "richter et al.(2001c ) find h@xmath0 absorption in two of two available sight lines at column densites of log @xmath24h@xmath212 .",
    "the magellanic stream contains heavy elements and dust ( lu et al.1998 ) , thus allowing h@xmath0 grain formation .",
    "in addition , the uv radiation field in the magellanic stream is expected to be low , resulting in a rather moderate h@xmath0 photo - dissociation rate ( see sembach et al.2001a ) . however",
    ", a low uv radiation field alone is not sufficient to allow diffuse h@xmath0 to exist at moderate densities , as demonstrated by the many non - detections of h@xmath0 in metal - poor , intergalactic ly@xmath20 clouds ( e.g. , petitjean , srianand & ledoux 2000 ) , and in high - velocity cloud complex c. towards pg1259 + 593 , richter et al.(2001c ) have studied h@xmath0 absorption in complex c at a relatively high hi column density of log @xmath24hi@xmath213 .",
    "no h@xmath0 was found down to a level of log @xmath24h@xmath214 , although newer westerbork hi 21 cm interferometer data clearly shows , that this sight line passes a very confined hi clump .",
    "complex c is more than 6 kpc away from the galactic plane and thus the uv radiation field in complex c is expected to be at least as low as in ivcs . a detailed heavy element abundance study ( richter et al.2001b ) shows that complex c has a @xmath17 solar metallicity in this direction and the abundance pattern implies that there is no or only very little dust present .",
    "therefore , h@xmath0 grain formation is suppressed , and gas phase formation processes ( black 1978 ) are obviously not efficient enough to allow diffuse h@xmath0 gas to exist in complex c , even at relatively high hi column densities .",
    "the current h@xmath0 absorption line data strongly suggest that the interplay of dust abundance and uv radiation field is of prime importance for the abundance of diffuse molecular hydrogen in the low - redshift universe .",
    "still , many of the h@xmath0 formation / destruction aspects remain unknown , such as the grain - formation rates in environments with low metallicities and precise uv photo - dissociation rates .",
    "as we have shown , ivcs in the milky way halo represent an interesting case for the study of h@xmath0 in diffuse solar - metallicity gas that is exposed to a moderate uv radiation field .",
    "its widespread distribution shows that h@xmath0 might be a rather robust constituent of the diffuse ism , if the overall conditions are appropriate .",
    "high s / n fuse observations are desirable to derive precise h@xmath0 column densities , molecular fractions , excitation temperatures in galactic halo clouds , and to search for the presence of high - density h@xmath0 clumps in ivcs and hvcs .",
    "such measurements might be of great importance for understanding and predicting the abundance of diffuse h@xmath0 in the more distant universe , where h@xmath0 is very difficult to measure systematically with absorption spectroscopy .",
    "we have used fuse absorption line data to study the molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath0 ) content of intermediate - velocity clouds ( ivcs ) in the lower halo of the milky way . +   + ( 1 ) from 61 hi ivc components that are sampled in a fuse data set of 56 sight lines at latitudes @xmath108 ,",

    "only 29 ivc components are sampled with fuse data at a sufficient s / n to measure log @xmath6 in the range @xmath218 ( @xmath148 detections , @xmath82 possible detections , and @xmath149 non - detections ) . for the rest of the data , ivc h@xmath0 might also be present at low molecular fractions , but can not be detected at the current data quality .",
    "our study reveals that intermediate - velocity clouds in the halo of the milky way contain a ubiquitous , diffuse molecular hydrogen component .",

    "we find a total h@xmath0 column density of log @xmath219 , and a molecular hydrogen fraction , log @xmath6 , of @xmath217 .",
    "the low @xmath63-values ( @xmath220 kms@xmath15 ) suggest that the ivc h@xmath0 gas resides in a very confined clump in this direction .",
    "two excitation temperatures are required to describe the rotational excitation of the h@xmath0 gas : for @xmath52 and @xmath56 we derive @xmath221 k , possibly representing an upper limit for the kinetic temperature of the gas . for @xmath222",
    "we find @xmath83 k. +   + ( 4 ) we have discussed the physical conditions in ivcs that are required to describe the distribution and properties of the observed h@xmath0 .",
    "the solar metallicities of ivcs , as well as their radial velocities , imply that most of these clouds represent the return flow of a galactic fountain , and that the h@xmath0 is forming on the surface of dust grains in the halo during the cooling and fragmentation process .",
    "if the h@xmath0 stays in formation - dissociation equilibrium , the molecular material must reside in a large number of small ( @xmath9 pc ) , rather dense ( @xmath223 @xmath11 ) filaments .",
    "most likely , the h@xmath0 gas traces the cold neutral medium in these clouds .",
    "we speculate that more dense regions with higher molecular fractions could exist , associated with tiny scale atomic structures .",
    "these would be difficult to be detected in h@xmath0 absorption due to their small size .",
    "+   + ( 5 ) h@xmath0 measurements in intermediate- and high - velocity clouds , in local galactic gas , in the magellanic clouds , and in intergalactic ly@xmath20 absorbers indicate that the interplay between dust and the uv radiation field is crucial for the abundance and distribution of diffuse h@xmath0 in the low - redshift universe .",
