    "this paper is motivated by the dramatic effects that are observed with the addition of small amounts of polymers to hydrodynamic flows . while interesting effects were discussed in the context of the transition to turbulence , vortex formation and turbulent transport @xcite , the phenomenon that attracted the most attention was , for obvious reasons , the reduction of friction drag by up to 80% when very small concentrations of long - chain polymers were added to turbulent flows @xcite . in spite of the fact that the phenomenon is robust and the effect huge , there exists no accepted theory that can claim quantitative agreement with the experimental facts .",
    "moreover , it appears that there is no mechanistic explanation . in the current theory that is due to de gennes",
    "@xcite one expects the kolmogorov cascade to be terminated at scales larger than kolmogorov scale , leading somehow to an increased buffer layer thickness and reduced drag , but how this happens and what is the fate of the turbulent energy is not being made clear .    in a recent letter",
    "@xcite we proposed that the crucial issue is in the _ production _ of energy of hydrodynamic fluctuations by their interaction with the mean flow .",
    "for the sake of concreteness we examined a poiseuille laminar flow and its loss of linear stability , and showed how small viscosity contrasts lead to an order of magnitude retardation in the onset of instability of  dangerous \" disturbances .",
    "specifically , we considered a flow in a channel of dimensionless width 2 , in which there are two fluids : one fluid of viscosity @xmath0 flows near the walls , and the other fluid of viscosity @xmath1 flows at the center , see fig .",
    "[ f : scheme ] .",
    "the viscosities differ slightly , for example we considered ( in dimensionless units ) @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the main ingredient of the calculation was that all the viscosity difference of 0.1 concentrated in a  mixed \" layer of width 0.10 .",
    "the motivation behind these numbers was the observation that the inferred effective viscosity in polymer drag reduction increases towards the center by about 30% over about a 1/3 of the half - channel @xcite . with our choice",
    "we have comparable viscosity gradients in the mixed layer .",
    "= 7.5 cm    in this model everything was explicitly calculable .",
    "the main point of our analysis ( see sect .",
    "[ primary ] for further details ) was that there exists a position in the channel where the velocity of the mean flow is the same as the velocity of the most dangerous primary instability .",
    "below we refer to the layer around this position as the  critical layer \" .",
    "if we placed the mixed layer in the vicinity of the critical layer , we got a giant effect of stabilization . analyzing this phenomenon",
    ", we demonstrated that nothing special happened to the dissipation .",
    "rather , it was the energy intake from the mean flow to the unstable mode that was dramatically reduced , giving rise to a large effect for a small cause .",
    "in this paper we extend these observations in two directions . in sect .",
    "[ primary ] , after reviewing the results of the simple model , we extend the analysis of the primary instability to a case in which the viscosity profile is that inferred from direct numerical simulations of turbulent channel flow of a dilute polymeric solution @xcite .",
    "we will see that very similar effects are found .",
    "in other words , one does not need to put by hand the region of viscosity variation in the vicinity of the critical layer .",
    "when we have a continuous variation of the viscosity in the region near the wall , the effect is the same , since it is only crucial that there will be _ some _ space dependence of the viscosity in the critical layer , which is usually not too far from the wall .",
    "a possible criticism of our results can be that the primary instability is still too far from typical turbulent fluctuations .",
    "this is in particular true since the most unstable primary modes are 2-dimensional , whereas typical turbulent fluctuations are 3-dimensional .",
    "for these reasons we present in sect .",
    "[ secondary ] the analysis of the effect of small viscosity variations on the secondary instability , for which the most  dangerous \" modes are 3-dimensional .",
    "the tactics are similar to those taken for the primary instability .",
    "first we discuss the effects of a mixed layer put at the ",
    "right \" place in the channel , and second we show that continuous viscosity profiles do exactly the same .",
    "we find again the giant effect of stabilization for relatively small viscosity variations , lending further support to our proposition that similar effects may very well play a crucial role in turbulent drag reduction . in sect .",
    "[ conclude ] we present concluding remarks and suggestions for the road ahead .",
    "it is well known that parallel poiseuille flow loses linear stability at some threshold reynolds number re = re@xmath4 ( close to 5772 ) .",
    "it is also well known that the instability is  convective \" , with the most unstable mode having a phase velocity @xmath5 .",
    "analytically it has the form _",

    "@xmath14 is the growth rate of the primary instability .",
    "what is not usually emphasized is that the main interactions leading to the loss of stability occur in a sharply defined region in the channel , i.e. at the critical layer whose distance from the wall is such that the phase velocity @xmath15 is identical to the velocity of the mean flow somewhere within this layer .",
    "it is thus worthwhile to examine the effect on the stability of poiseuille flow of a viscosity gradient placed in the vicinity of the critical layer",

    "any reasonable viscosity gradient of the right sign will pick up this term , leading to vastly enhanced stability .",
    "indeed , in the light of this discussion we can expect that the large effect of retardation of the instability would even increase if we make the mixed layer thinner .",
    "this is indeed so .",
    "nevertheless , one can not conclude that instability can be retarded at will , since other disturbances , differing from the primary mode , become unstable first , albeit at a much higher reynolds number than the primary mode ; when we stabilize a given mode substantially , we should watch out for other pre - existing / newly destabilized modes which may now be the least stable .",
    "finally , we connect our findings to the phenomenon of drag reduction in turbulent flows .",
    "since the total dissipation can be computed just from the knowledge of the velocity profile at the walls , any amount of drag reduction must be reflected by a corresponding reduction of the gradient at the walls .",
    "concurrently , the energy intake by the fluctuations from the mean flow should reduce as well .",
    "indeed , the latter effect was measured in both experiments @xcite and simulations @xcite .",
    "the question is which is the chicken and which is the egg . in our calculation",
    "we identified that the reduction in production comes first . from figs . 4 and 5 which are at the same value of @xmath50 we see that the dissipation does not change at all when the mixed layer moves , but the production is strongly affected",
    "of course , at steady state the velocity gradient at the wall must adjust as shown in fig .",
    "one could think that the strong stabilization discussed in the previous subsection is only due to the precise positioning of the mixed layer at the critical layer .",
    "if so , the result would have very little generic consequence . in this subsection",
    "we show that any reasonable viscosity profile achieves the same effects . to this aim",
    "we consider the effective viscosity profile reported in @xcite ( in their fig .",
    "5 ) which is obtained from simulations of a turbulent channel flow with polymer additive .",

    "it is sufficient that there exist a viscosity variation in the region of the critical layer ( indicated as the vertical line in fig .",

    "we would like to propose that similar effects should be examined in the case of turbulent drag reduction by polymer additives .",
    "we recognize that in a turbulent flow there are many more modes that interact , but we propose that a similar mechanism operates for each mode at its critical layer , where both elastic and viscous effects determine the mean flow .",
    "the advantage of the present calculation is that we can consider all the putative unstable modes , and conclude that with a viscosity gradient similar to that seen in polymeric turbulent flows the linear threshold @xmath112 goes up five times ( to 31000 ) .",
    "we note in passing that this effect had not been put to an experimental test , and it would be exciting to have a confirmation of our predictions by future experiments . for actual turbulent flows we will need first to identify what are the main modes that interact between themselves and with the mean flow .",
    "a significant numerical effort is required , but appears worthwhile due to the importance of the phenomenon of drag reduction , and its relative lack of understanding .",
    "we have demonstrated that the exact form of the viscosity profile is immaterial ; a continuous profile of viscosity in the critical region behaves exaclty like a thin mixed layer .",
    "we have shown that the secondary three dimensional modes of instability are `` slaved '' to the primary linear mode of instability : the mechanism which stabilizes the primary mode indirectly ensures that the secondary is damped out quickly .",
    "finally we note that a linear disturbance can rear its head either in the form of the fastest growing ( or slowest decaying ) mode as considered here ; or in non - modal form with a transient growth followed by long - term decay @xcite .",
    "the former situation will correspond to relatively high reynolds numbers , or cleaner set - ups .",
    "we expect similar conclusions in the latter situation as well .",
