    "the ability of disk galaxies to survive in a violent universe filled with merger events is one of the central mysteries remaining in our understanding of galaxy evolution .",
    "a partial solution to this puzzle may be that while disks can be destroyed by galaxy - galaxy mergers ( yielding e / s0 morphologies ) , they can also be reborn at a later time .",
    "recent work has identified a population of low - to - intermediate mass , morphologically defined e / s0 galaxies that are surprisingly blue @xcite , indicating young stars .",
    "they occupy low density environments and have substantial cold gas to fuel star formation .",
    "could these galaxies indeed be regenerating late - type morphology ?",
    "the recent _ galex _ discovery of extended ultraviolet ( xuv ) disks ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , representing very young stars around late - type galaxies , has provided tantalizing evidence for large - scale disk building at @xmath4 . here",
    "we search for xuv emission in e / s0 galaxies to examine evidence for disk regrowth after mergers .",
    "our sample includes 30 e / s0s selected to be representative of the red and blue sequences in a stellar mass range primarily below @xmath05 x 10@xmath5  m@xmath6 ( fig .",
    "1 ) , where many e / s0s have substantial gas . nine of these have fully reduced data , enabling detailed analysis .",
    "@xcite define xuv disks of two types . a type",
    "1 xuv disk has more than one structured uv - bright emission complex beyond a central surface brightness contour corresponding to the anticipated star formation threshold ( nuv 27.35 ab magarcsec@xmath7 ) .",
    "a type 2 xuv disk has fuv(ab ) @xmath3 @xmath1(ab ) @xmath8 4 in a `` large '' ( i.e. , area at least 7 times the enclosed area of the @xmath2 contour ) optically low surface brightness ( lsb ) zone within the expected star formation threshold but outside @xmath2 . at present",
    "we can apply thilker s definitions to only the nine galaxies with fully analyzed data , so we apply a third , more subjective identification method to our full 30-galaxy e / s0 sample in  3 .    applying the type 1 xuv - disk definition to our",
    "subsample yields a 6/9 or @xmath067% incidence of xuv disks of this type and one borderline case with fainter extended emission .",
    "an example of a type 1 xuv disk is ngc 4117 ( fig .",
    "2 left panels ) , one of several identified on the red sequence .",
    "its nuv imaging shows clumpy uv morphology outside the anticipated star formation threshold .",
    "we note , however , that the type 1 requirement of structured emission is sometimes difficult to apply consistently to galaxies like those in our sample , which have a smaller extent on the sky than those considered in thilker s defining sample , so their structure is blurred by the relatively low angular resolution of _ galex_.    the implicit assumption of the type 2 xuv - disk definition , that the expected star formation threshold lies outside the @xmath2 contour , is satisfied in our sample primarily for e / s0s with `` spiral - like '' or even bluer colors , for example ngc 3870 ( fig",
    ". 2 right panels ) .",
    "this definition s lack of applicability to many galaxies in our sample is intriguing .",
    "figure 3 shows that as the ratio between the @xmath2 radius and the expected star formation threshold radius increases for our sample objects , indicating centrally concentrated star formation , the star formation rate tends to decrease .",
    "conversely , three of our uv - bluest e / s0s ( ngc 3870 , ngc 3011 , and ic 692 , the borderline type 1 case ) do have their star formation thresholds outside @xmath2 and satisfy the type 2 requirement of fuv - @xmath1 @xmath8 4 in the lsb zone between the @xmath2 and threshold radii ( converting from irac 3.6 @xmath9 m to @xmath1-band intensity following @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "although the lsb zone is not `` large '' as for a standard type 2 xuv , these galaxies have bluer uv colors and higher star formation rates than our type 1 xuvs ( fig .",
    "3 ) , so we label them `` modified type 2 '' xuvs . within the constraints of small number statistics , these results suggest that type 1 morphology may be indicative of inefficient star formation or star formation just beginning , while the bluer disks forming in modified type 2 xuvs may reflect inside - out disk regrowth .",
    "as a precursor to completing the data analysis necessary to apply thilker s type 1 and 2 definitions to our full 30-galaxy sample , we apply a third , more subjective identification method . an xuv disk in this third method",
    "is defined as having extended uv emission relative to the optical in a visual comparison of nuv and sdss @xmath10-band images . by this preliminary identification @xmath033% of our sample",
    "are xuv candidates , similar to the @xmath030% fraction for late - type galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "for the nine - galaxy subsample analyzed in detail , this method yields 5/9 or @xmath056% incidence of xuv disks , which is actually lower than the frequency of xuvs identified using thilker s type 1 and 2 criteria . our preliminary identification of xuv - disk morphologies in e / s0s at a wide range of masses and on both",
    "the red and blue sequences may indicate an association with processes like gas accretion and/or galaxy interactions that affect the galaxy population broadly , perhaps contributing to disk regrowth after mergers .",
    "we thank stuart vogel ( university of maryland ) , jocelly guie ( university of texas at austin ) , hillary mathis ( noao ) , and shardha jogee ( university of texas at austin ) for their role in acquiring the data .",
