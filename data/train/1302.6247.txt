    "the maximum energy reached by a charged particle in a given astrophysical object is limited by the size of the acceleration region .",
    "if the relativistic larmor radius of the particle @xmath2 is of order the system size @xmath3 , the particle escapes and is no longer accelerated . the maximum energy is then given by @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the charge of the particle and @xmath6 is the typical magnetic field strength .",
    "radiative losses within the accelerator decrease this limit ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the maximum energy is then set by the balance between the electric acceleration rate and the radiative power lost by the particle . in the case of synchrotron cooling",
    ", this balance leads to a remarkable result : the maximum synchrotron photon energy emitted by an electron depends only on the ratio of the electric field to magnetic field perpendicular to the particle s motion , i.e. , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the fine structure constant and @xmath9 is the rest mass energy of the electron .",
    "hence , under ideal magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) conditions where @xmath10 , the energy of synchrotron radiation should not exceed the fundamental constant @xmath11mev @xcite .",
    "an electron with energy above the radiation reaction limit would lose most of its energy in a fraction of a larmor gyration .",
    "it is then impossible to have electrons radiating synchrotron radiation above 160  mev with classical models of particle acceleration , all based on ideal mhd ( e.g. , diffuse shock acceleration ) , unless the plasma has a relativistic bulk motion with respect to the observer , or the electrons are the by - product of energetic particle decay .",
    "yet , the gamma - ray space telescopes _ agile _ and _ fermi _ discovered several powerful gamma - ray flares from the crab nebula , presumably during which pev electrons and positrons emit synchrotron radiation well above the @xmath0mev limit .",
    "the most powerful flare , recorded in april 2011 , showed clear evidence for synchrotron emission up to @xmath12mev @xcite .",
    "this discovery suggests that an extreme and non - conventional particle acceleration mechanism is at work somewhere in the nebula , unless the emission is substantially doppler - boosted by a factor @xmath13 .",
    "however , the typical flow velocity in the nebula ( about half the speed of light , e.g. , @xcite ) and its orientation with respect to the observer give a doppler factor of order unity .",
    "the precise location of the flare is unknown because the nebula is not resolved in gamma rays , but it should not originate very close to the pulsar because of lack of pulsations .",
    "the @xmath14hours flux - doubling timescale observed during the flare indicates that a tiny fraction of the nebula is involved .",
    "the flaring region radiates about 30  times more than the quiescent emission above 100  mev , which represents up to 1% of the pulsar spin - down power @xcite . to explain particle acceleration and emission within the overall duration of the flares , ranging from a few days to a few weeks",
    ", the magnetic field should be of order a few mg , i.e. , much more intense than the average @xmath15 g traditionally inferred from spectral modeling .",
    "simultaneous observations in radio , near - infrared , optical , x - rays and in tev gamma - rays , were not able to detect a solid counterpart to the flares ( see @xcite , and references therein ) , suggesting that the emitting particle spectrum is very hard , perhaps monoenergetic .",
    "it is very difficult to reconcile these puzzling features with classical models of particle acceleration and models of pulsar wind nebulae ( @xcite , and see @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "various models have been proposed to solve the crab flares mystery .",
    "several studies invoke a relativistic doppler boosting of the flaring region by a factor of a few .",
    "it was proposed that a mildly relativistic flow could be achieved close to the pulsar wind termination shock @xcite , in relativistic reconnection events within the nebula @xcite , in a magnetized flow at the base of the crab jets @xcite , or in knots of energetic particles @xcite .",
    "the dissipation of the striped pulsar wind structure through the shock could also generate rapidly fluctuating magnetic field on small scales resulting in synchrotron gamma - ray flares @xcite .",
    "if the magnetic turbulence in the nebula occurs on length scale shorter than the synchrotron photon formation length @xmath16 , then the particles could radiate jitter radiation @xcite , with typical energy greater than the classical synchrotron limit @xcite .",
    "alternatively , particle acceleration could occur in regions of strong coherent electric field , in twisted toroidal fields @xcite , or in magnetic reconnection sites within the nebula @xcite .",
    "magnetic reconnection offers natural locations ( within the diffusion region where the magnetic field is small and reverses ) in which the electric field can exceed the magnetic field . in principle , it is possible to accelerate particles above the classical radiation reaction limit at these sites @xcite .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the highest energy particles are trapped and focused towards the reconnection layer midplane , following the relativistic analog of speiser orbits @xcite . once deep inside the layer , the particles are subject to weak radiative losses , but strong coherent electric field",
    ". the layer acts as a linear accelerator , and the maximum energy of the particles is then limited just by the total electric potential drop along the layer , i.e. , @xmath17 , where @xmath3 is the length of the layer . using relativistic test - particle simulations",
    ", we found in @xcite that magnetic reconnection could generate a quasi - monoenergetic beam of particles above the radiation reaction limit in the crab nebula .    in this paper , we re - examine particle acceleration in ultra - relativistic pair plasma reconnection , using 2d particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations .",
    "such simulations capture self - consistently the time - evolution of fields and particles at the kinetic level . for this study",

    "our second objective is to study the radiative signature of such acceleration following @xcite , in order to explain all observed features of the crab flares . @xcite",
    "included optically thin synchrotron radiation as a tracer , but this calculation was not self - consistent because it did not treat radiation reaction effects on particle motion .",

    "we discuss our findings in the context of the crab gamma - ray flares in section  [ crab ] .",
    "section  [ ccl ] summarizes the main results of this work .",
    "zeltron is a new three - dimensional , parallel ( domain decomposition with mpi ) , relativistic , electromagnetic particle - in - cell code developed independently from other existing codes ( for a review about pic methods , see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "zeltron follows an explicit finite - difference scheme on a cartesian grid , with a time step @xmath18 set at a fraction of the maximum stable step determined by the courant - friedrichs - lewy condition , i.e. , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the speed of light , @xmath21and @xmath22 are the minimum grid spacing in the @xmath23- , @xmath24- , and @xmath25-directions .",

    "this algorithm has second - order error in space and time and ensures that @xmath30 at any instant of the simulation ( to the computer round - off accuracy ) .",

    "the electric field has to be corrected every time step by the small amount @xmath33 , obtained by solving poisson s equation @xcite , i.e. , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the poisson solver implemented in the code utilizes an iterative gauss - seidel method ( with 5-points in 2d , and 7-points in 3d ) .",
    "the main novelty of zeltron , compared to most pic codes , is the ability to take into account the effect of the radiation reaction force on the motion of the particles .",
    "the ( non - covariant ) equation of motion of a single particle is given by the lorentz - abraham - dirac equation @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the four - velocity of the particle , @xmath38 is the associated lorentz factor , and @xmath39 is the radiation reaction force . the fields at the location of the particle @xmath40 and @xmath41 , are linear interpolations of the fields @xmath27 and @xmath28 known at the grid nodes . within the framework of classical electrodynamics , the radiation reaction force is obtained from the landau - lifshitz equation @xcite , valid as long as the product @xmath42 is much smaller than the quantum critical magnetic field @xmath43 g , where @xmath44 is the elementary electric charge , and @xmath45 with @xmath46 the planck constant . in the ultra - relativistic regime ( @xmath47 ) , the radiation reaction force can simply be expressed as a continuous friction force opposite to the particle s direction of motion ( see discussion in @xcite ) , i.e. , @xmath48\\mathbf{u } , \\label{rad_force}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the classical radius of the electron .",
    "following @xcite , zeltron uses a modified boris algorithm @xcite to solve the equation of motion with the radiation reaction force given in eq .",
    "( [ rad_force ] ) . for an alternative implementation of the radiation reaction force in pic codes , see also @xcite",

    "the code assigns variable weights to the macro - particles to model particle density gradient .",
    "zeltron does not strictly conserve the total energy .",
    "for the purpose of this study , we ran zeltron successfully on thousands of cores on the kraken supercomputer and on the university of colorado janus and verus supercomputers .",
    "we find excellent agreement between zeltron and the well - tested pic code vorpal @xcite , in the limit where radiative losses are neglected ( the radiation reaction force is currently not implemented in vorpal ) .",

    "the initial setup is very similar to our previous study @xcite , which is standard in such reconnection simulations .",
    "the computational domain is a rectangle of size @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the length of the box in each direction .",
    "it contains two anti - parallel relativistic , flat , harris current sheets @xcite in the @xmath52-plane , which enables us to set periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath23- and @xmath24- directions .",

    "[ fig_density ] ) , in order to force the onset of reconnection at the beginning of the simulation , thereby reducing the computing time .",
    "if there is no perturbation , we find that reconnection eventually happens spontaneously in the simulation because of the high numerical noise inherent to pic codes .    a population of relativistic thermal pairs , following a maxwell - jttner distribution and concentrated in the current layers , balances the upstream magnetic pressure and carries the initial current in the @xmath61-directions given by the bulk motion of these particles , drifting at a velocity @xmath62 .",

    "the maximum energy expected to be reached by the particles in the simulation ( in the absence of radiative losses ) is limited by the electric potential drop along the layer , which is proportional to the system size @xmath3 and the dimensionless reconnection rate @xmath77 , such that @xmath78 . to observe particle acceleration above the radiation reaction limit ( eq .  [ grad ] ) , the system size @xmath3 must be bigger than @xmath79 .",
    "@xmath79 must also be large compared with the smallest spatial scales in the system , given by the larmor radius of the lowest energy particles injected initially .",

    "however , such a broad range in energy can not be reached with the current computing power available , even for 2d simulations .",
    "our simulations model only the high - energy end of the crab nebula spectrum .",
    "the initial @xmath86 power - law of the electrons approximately represents the purely non - thermal background particles emitting the quiescent emission of the crab nebula , inferred from spectral modeling .",
    "this assumes pre - acceleration of the particles in the nebula , possibly by shock acceleration or by other reconnection events .    in the following , we express all spatial scales in terms of the initial minimum larmor radius @xmath87 cm , and timescales with respect to the corresponding inverse larmor frequency @xmath88seconds .",

    "each arm is produced by the deflection of the particles by the guide field in the @xmath114-directions , caused by the lorentz force , and is composed of electrons or positrons only . as a result",

    "we also find that the strong energy - dependent anisotropy of the particles and radiation is preserved with a guide field , although the structure of the beam is more complex ( high - energy particles occasionally point towards high latitudes @xmath119 )",
    ".    the deflection of the particles away from the layer does not limit significantly the efficiency of particle acceleration through the speiser mechanism .",
    "the particle energy distribution extends up to @xmath120 .",
    "the analysis of a sample of particles tracked throughout the simulation shows that the energetic particles are inevitably deflected away from the layer , but only after several crossings of the layer .",
    "[ fig_guide_orbit ] shows three typical high - energy particles trajectories , projected in the @xmath121-plane .",
    "the particles are progressively carried outside the layer by the guide field , and have time to cool over a larmor timescale .",
    "the radiation reaction force gradually overcomes the electric force because the pitch angle of the particle to the magnetic field line ( and hence the perpendicular magnetic field ) increases progressively as it exits the layer .",
    "in contrast , the ejection of the energetic particles into strong @xmath122 in the weak guide field case is abrupt : the radiation reaction force jumps rapidly over a short period of time and exceeds the electric force , leading to a rapid ( sub - larmor ) cooling and the emission of @xmath1mev synchrotron photons ( fig .",

    "a moderate guide field may be beneficial for particle acceleration in three - dimensional pair plasma reconnection .",
    "it tends to suppress the development of the drift kink instability that occurs only in 3d , which may quench non - thermal particle acceleration ( @xcite , see also the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "a large 3d simulation such as those presented here in 2d is currently beyond our computational resources .",
    "we leave this issue to a future study .",
    "in this section , we discuss the implications of our findings in the context of the crab gamma - ray flares .",
    "below , we review the observational features of the flares , and show how reconnection can naturally explain them :    * * synchrotron radiation @xmath129  mev : * all flares show synchrotron radiation well above the @xmath0mev burnoff limit , up to @xmath12mev during the april 2011 super - flare @xcite .",
    "we showed in section  [ speiser ] that particles can be accelerated well above the classical radiation reaction limit , via the relativistic speiser mechanism deep inside the layer , and radiate synchrotron radiation up to @xmath130  mev .",
    "the most energetic particles go through a substantial fraction of the electric potential drop available in the simulation , i.e. @xmath131pev , with @xmath132 , @xmath71 mg , and @xmath133  light - days . * * hard spectrum * : the april 2011 flare unambiguously shows an extra synchrotron component on top of the quiescent emission .",
    "the spectrum averaged over the flare is hard , such that @xmath134 @xcite , i.e. , consistent with an emitting population of pairs distributed with a power - law of index @xmath135 .",
    "the energy of the distribution is then dominated by the highest energy particles .",
    "we find that a hard spectrum ( although not as hard as observed ) is naturally expected in our simulations during the brightest periods of high - energy emission ( periods 8 - 9 - 10 in fig .",
    "[ fig_light ] ) , when the photon index above @xmath136mev is around @xmath137 .",
    "a hard spectrum could explain why there is no detectable counterpart at lower energies ( x - rays , optical , ir , radio ) . * * ultra - rapid time variability : * the first short intra - flare variability was detected in the 4-day - long september 2010 flare , over a @xmath138-hours timescale . during the 9-day - long april 2011 flare , there are significant variations of the flux over periods @xmath139  hours @xcite .",
    "hence , there are even smaller structures in the flaring region emitting each spike of high - energy radiation . along the lines of @xcite",
    ", we find in section  [ var ] that super - fast time variability of the observed high - energy flux is expected , due to the strong inhomogeneity and anisotropy of the most energetic particles responsible for the @xmath140  mev emission .",
    "we see a flare on earth only when the beam of high - energy radiation crosses our line of sight .",
    "the symmetry of the sub - flare time profile is also consistent with observations .",
    "we attribute the overall duration of the crab flares ( from a few days to a couple of weeks ) to the reconnection timescale , i.e. , of order the light crossing time of the reconnecting region , @xmath141days in our simulations ( fig .",
    "[ fig_light ] ) .",

    "our study also reveals that the power - density spectrum of the @xmath143mev light curve is expected to be almost flat ( white noise , fig .",

    "this result is interpreted by @xcite as the signature of the rapid variations of relativistic doppler - boosted emission @xcite .",
    "we discovered in section  [ var ] that reconnection can reproduce such a correlation as well , with a power - law index @xmath146 , and mimic the effect of doppler beaming as expected in ultra - relativistic reconnection @xcite .",
