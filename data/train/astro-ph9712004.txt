    "as the largest gravitationally bound structures known , clusters can set clear constraints on the formation of structure and on the composition of the universe .",
    "three independent techniques have been used to determine the mass distribution in galaxy clusters .",
    "the oldest and most conventional approach is based on galaxy velocity dispersion and application of the virial theorem .",
    "here it is assumed that galaxy orbits are isotropic and that light traces the dark matter .",
    "a second method derives gravitational mass profiles from x - ray observations under the assumptions of thermal hydrostatic equilibrium and spherical symmetry . in this technique",
    "only two observables must be known to reconstruct the distribution of mass , the electron density of the cluster gas and its temperature , clearly an advantage with respect to the often limited optical data available to define the cluster structure .",
    "the x - ray derived mass , however , may not necessarily be representative of the true cluster mass if merger compression or shocks are present . over the last ten years it has been possible to determine cluster masses using the effect of gravitational lensing , both in its strong and weak manifestations",
    "( see the excellent review of fort and mellier , 1994 , for a list of clusters that has been analyzed . ) .",
    "the lensing method has the advantage that the mass measurement is independent of the thermodynamical state of the gravitating matter .",
    "the weak distortions ( tyson 1990 ; kaiser and squires , 1993 ) are particularly suited to map cluster mass at large radii .",
    "strong lensing is restricted to the cluster core .",
    "the use of the three techniques in conjuction allows an examination of the uncertainties of each method and provides a unique possibility to study the dynamical and physical state of the gas and dark matter in clusters .",
    "it is worth noting that even if theoretically one should obtain the same masses if clusters are dynamically relaxed , in practice comparisons of masses derived from dynamical analyses and gravitational lensing have shown a significant discrepancy in the mass estimates ( m@xmath5 from 5 to 2 going from inner 250  300 kpc of the cluster center up to 1 mpc ; see wu and fang , 1996 , 1997 and references therein ) , but there are exceptions as mentioned below .",
    "several possibilities have been suggested to resolve this discrepancy . among others :",
    "inadequacy of the isothermal , hydrostatic equilibrium models of the x - ray analyses that cause systematic underestimate of the cluster mass ( wu and fang 1996 ) ; projection effect of an asymmetrical matter distribution ( miralda - escud and babul , 1995 ) ; presence of substructures in x - ray clusters and cluster mergers ( henry and briel 1995 , 1996 ; markevitch 1996 ) which would help to explain the discrepancy in a2218 ( kenib 1995 ; squires 1996a ) and in a2219 ( smail 1995a ) ; inhomogeneous intracluster medium ( miralda - escud and babul , 1995 ) ; the possibility of x - ray lensing ( in a2218 , markevitch 1997 ) ; existence of nonthermal cosmic ray pressure which could support the intracluster ionised gas ( ensslin 1997 ) ; offsets between x - ray and lensing centres and overestimate of the core radii of the dominant mass clumps in non - cooling flow systems ( allen , 1997 ) .",
    "however , recent analyses with better data show a more complex picture that will lead to a better understanding of the physical processes going on in clusters .    marginal agreement of the mass determinations from x - ray and lensing analyses is found in a2163 ( miralda - escud and babul 1995 ) , and confirmed by squires 1997 , using weak lensing and new rosat hri and pspc data . a similar analysis by smail 1995b , for the medium survey clusters ms1455@xmath422 and ms0016@xmath416 found agreement between the lensing and x - ray masses .",
    "a consistent picture is constructed for a2390 by pierre 1996 , and squires 1996b .",
    "allen 1996 , present a multi - phase x - ray analysis of pks0745@xmath6191 , a regular and relaxed cluster with a massive cooling flow .",
    "the excellent agreement of the mass distributions lead them to conclude that the x - ray gas in pks0745@xmath6191 is in hydrostatic equilibrium , and that non - thermal pressures components are not required by the data , differently from the cases of a1689 or a2218 ( miralda - escud and babul , 1995 ; loeb and mao 1994 ) . in a recent analysis of 13 clusters observed with asca and rosat ,",
    "allen points out that the x - ray and strong gravitational lensing mass measurements show excellent agreement for the cooling - flow clusters in his sample , while for the non - cooling flow clusters , the masses determined from the strong lensing data exceed the x - ray values by factors of 2@xmath64 .",
    "allen suggests that these discrepancies can be reconciled if one takes into account that the dynamical activity observed in non - cooling flow clusters has caused the x - ray analyses to overestimate the core radii of the dominant mass clumps .",
    "other factors as substructure and line - of - sight alignments of material towards the cluster cores may also contribute to the discrepancies .",
    "a quite different and interesting approach is taken by smail ( 1997 ) to analyze a small sample of 12 clusters observed by the hubble space telescope ( hst ) . from the comparison of the mean gravitational shear strength with the cluster x - ray luminosities they develop a model used to predict the relationship expected from properties of local clusters . in this way they can distinguish between models for the evolution of the cluster properties .",
    "it is an innovative and promising study to measure cluster evolution once an expanded and better defined sample of clusters are examined .    in this paper",
    ", we present a study of the gas and mass distributions of the cluster of galaxies 04 .",
    "originally discovered through its x - ray emission in the extended medium sensitivity survey ( emss ; gioia 1990 ) , 04 was part of a mauna kea based observational program to search for arcs and arclets in a complete sample of x - ray luminous medium - distant ( 0.15@xmath7z@xmath70.83 ) clusters of galaxies . at a redshift of z@xmath00.1965 ,",
    "04 has the most striking example of an arc system in a compact , centrally condensed cluster .",
    "ground based ccd observations of 04 show at least 15 blue segments of circular structures surrounding a multiple nucleus cd galaxy ( luppino 1993 ) .",
    "the arcs are unresolved even in superb observing conditions ( seeing @xmath80.5@xmath9 ) at mauna kea observatory .",
    "we have extended the study of 04 with the refurbished hst and with x - ray satellite observations .",
    "deep images , acquired with the wfpc2 camera aboard hst , reveal detailed structures in both the previously known arcs and the newly discovered arcs .",
    "constraints on the mass of the cluster are derived from detailed modeling of these arcs .",
    "additional mass estimates are obtained from x - ray observations of 04 with rosat / hri and asca .",
    "we also acquired spectra for 40 cluster members from the ground and , therefore , were able to estimate the velocity dispersion of the cluster , which yields an independent dynamical estimate of the cluster mass .",
    "we present both the optical and x - ray data that we have acquired and make comparisons between the diverse and complementary mass distribution estimates for 04 . to reconcile the discrepancy of mass estimates from the dynamical and lensing analyses , we present a very simple model with a mass profile that increases more rapidly than a @xmath1 model at large radii .",
    "the model explored in this paper is one with two isothermal spheres .",
    "we remind here that more general models fit all of our data better and allow a wider range of masses that are consistent with the lensing data ( shaya 1998 ) .",
    "we emphasize that the two isothermal spheres model is indeed a speculation but it is presented as one of the possible solutions to remove the discrepancy .",
    "subsequent papers will give a more detailed analysis of the cluster properties and mass models that we are studying based on our multi - frequency dataset . throughout this paper , we assume h@xmath10 h@xmath11 km s@xmath12 mpc@xmath12 , the density parameter @xmath13 , and the cosmological constant @xmath14 , unless otherwise stated . at the redshift of the cluster , the luminosity distance is 1231 h@xmath15 mpc , the angular size distance is 860 h@xmath15 mpc , and the scale is 4.17 h@xmath15 kpc per arcsec .",
    "we acquired 10 exposures on consecutive orbits with the wfpc2 and the f702w filter in october 1994 , for a total integration time of 22,200  s. the core of the cluster fits conveniently inside the @xmath16 field of view of the wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) , the best performing chip .",
    "the pixel size in this camera is 99.6 milliarcsec ( holtzman 1995 ) .",
    "each exposure was offset by an integer number of pixels in both axes to aid in the correction for cosmic rays , dead pixels , and hot pixels .",
    "the standard stsci processed frames were registered and co - added using iraf / stsdas routines . the final 4-chip mosaic frame is shown in figure 1 ( plate ) .",
    "the diffuse light , mostly from the envelope of the cd galaxy and partially from other galaxies , is detectable everywhere in the lensing region of this cluster . in figure 2 ( plate )",
    ", the diffuse light from the galaxies is diminished to bring out sharp structures by subtracting an image composed of the median value in a 19 by 19 pixel box around each pixel .",
    "the photometry was performed using the faint galaxy photometry software described in le fvre ( 1986 ) , and lilly ( 1996 ) .",
    "the photometric calibration was based on the hst calibration coefficients ( holtzman 1995 ) and confirmed by our ground based imaging ( luppino 1993 ) within 0.1 magnitude .",
    "manual intervention was required to include the arcs with the largest axis ratio , which were not identified by the software .",
    "the histogram of number counts with johnson r band magnitude is presented in figure 3 .",
    "the number counts decline for @xmath17 indicating that the counts are incomplete at fainter magnitudes",
    ". a total of 901 objects with peak intensity above @xmath1825.5 mag arcsec@xmath19 ( @xmath20 over the sky background ) have been identified in the 4.71 arcmin@xmath21 hst field usable for photometry .",
    "table 1 gives the r surface brightness in mag arcsec@xmath19 for the objects with available spectroscopy ( see section 3 . for a description and figure 4 ) .",
    "the peak of the light distribution has been determined after removal of the bright star next to the core . after a gaussian filter with @xmath22 pixels",
    "was applied to the image , the peak of the light distribution is measured to be 16 from galaxy a. ellipse fitting of the light envelope of the central core for the @xmath23 mag arcsec@xmath19 isophote indicates a major axis of 25 , an ellipticity of @xmath24 , with @xmath25 , and a position angle of 78@xmath26 .",
    "the center of this isophote fitting , indicated by a cross in figure 2 , is at @xmath27  =  04@xmath2843@xmath290971 and @xmath30 ( j2000 ) , just 12 north and 11 west from galaxy a.      the arc system is remarkable for the symmetry of the distortion pattern , and the large number of very elongated arcs .",
    "the most spectacular arc system is formed by arcs a2 and a3 ( see figure 2 ) which are resolved into bright knots by the hst .",
    "the very high axial ratios of these arcs indicate that they are quite near the critical radius .",
    "arc a1 , which was the most spectacular looking arc in the ground based image , appears to be a highly distorted image of a galaxy but not necessarily a strongly lensed object and we have found no other counter images of it .",
    "arcs a5 and a6 both have multiple knots .",
    "each of these knots , when reconstructed at the source plane , merges together with its counter image .",
    "the ability to bring these two intricate arcs together in a consistent way is a key requirement for a successful reconstruction for this cluster .",
    "arcs a8 and a9 are very close to each other and are at nearly the same distance from the center of the light distribution .",
    "it is most probable that they emanate from a single object near the critical radius .",
    "the critical radius in the image plane grows with the redshift of the source , therefore the source of arcs a8 and a9 must be at a lower redshift than the source for arcs a2 and a3 .",
    "two radial structures are observed near the center of the cluster . to identify the geometry of each feature more clearly and measure its magnitude",
    ", we have processed the central region of the cluster in the following manner .",
    "the two galaxies at the northern edge of the radial arc a17 have been modeled with @xmath31 profiles , and then subtracted from the image . a gaussian filter with @xmath32 pixels",
    "was then applied to the resulting image , and the result was subtracted from the non - filtered image .",
    "one arc is the slightly curved feature ( a17 in figure 2 ) 65 to the north of galaxy a. it subtends 25 , and has a magnitude @xmath33 .",
    "another radial feature is observed 4  north of galaxy b ( a16 in figure 2 ) .",
    "it subtends 2 with @xmath34 and is thus a more marginal feature .",
    "both radial arcs have been used in the reconstruction to background source galaxies of this cluster .",
    "spectroscopy was obtained in the field of 04 in october 1993 with the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) equipped with the multi - object spectrograph ( 1994 ) .",
    "the o300 grism was used to provide a wavelength coverage from 4500   to 9000 and a pixel size of 5.5  / pixel .",
    "a slit width of 15 was used , providing a spectral resolution of 17  .",
    "each 30 minute exposure was offset to allow removal of cosmic rays and bad pixels .",
    "the total exposure times for each object ranged from 2 to 3.5 hrs depending on which masks the object was seen through and on weather conditions ( mean seeing @xmath8 15 ) .",
    "the data were reduced using the multired package developed by ( 1995 ) .",
    "fourteen galaxies , out of 15 objects observed , are cluster members .",
    "one galaxy is the arc - like structure to the east of the cluster core ( a1 in figure 2 ) .",
    "04 was also observed in november 1993 , at the multiple mirror telescope ( mmt ) with the red channel spectrograph and the 300 gr / mm grating .",
    "exposures between 1 and 1.5 hrs were made using 7 aperture plates with between 7 and 10 slits each .",
    "the pixel size was 3.21  / pixel , the spectral resolution was 10  , and the seeing was between 1  and 15 .",
    "standard data reduction and velocity measurements with the xcsao package under iraf confirmed 37 cluster members .",
    "nine cluster galaxies ( labelled as g6 , g10 , g13 , g18 , g26 , g28 , g30 , g33 and g35 in figure 4 ) are in common with the cfht observations , thus allowing an estimate of external errors .",
    "the average velocity difference from the common data is @xmath35227 km s@xmath12 with an @xmath36 dispersion of 327 km s@xmath12 .",
    "we attempted to obtain long - slit spectroscopy of the brightest arcs in ms0440@xmath40204 in january and october 1995 with the low resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris ) at the w. m. keck 10 m telescope .",
    "poor weather and problems with the instrumentation prevented us from obtaining additional useful spectra of arcs .",
    "however , part of the data from both runs could be used to obtain spectra for 10 objects .",
    "these objects happened to fall in the @xmath37  or @xmath38  slits that were positioned on the arcs .",
    "the 300 gr / mm grating was used which gives a pixel size of 2.5  / pixel .",
    "four objects are cluster members ( 1 in common with mmt data ; g8 in figure 4 ) , one object at @xmath8 16 to the southwest of the cluster is a qso , another is an m star , and the remaining objects are galaxies in the background of the cluster .",
    "their redshifts range from 0.387 to 0.777 , but none of these galaxies lies within the effective strong - lensing area .",
    "all the objects with spectroscopy are listed in table 1 and marked in figure 4 . for each object",
    "the measured velocity ( barycentric ) plus its 1@xmath39 error , and redshift are given .",
    "galaxies marked as g , c , and k in figure 4 have been observed with the mmt , the cfht , and the keck telescope , respectively .",
    "k5 denotes the qso in the field at z=0.4719@xmath400.0006 .",
    "velocities are given for eight additional galaxies ( marked 1 through 8) which are not cluster members ( redshifts range from 0.0766 to 0.2617 ) .",
    "galaxy c4 is outside the field of view of figure 4 .    in total ,",
    "54 objects have securely identified redshifts in the field and 40 objects are consistent with being cluster members ( marked with an asterisk in table 1 ) .",
    "the velocity histogram for the 44 galaxies with the approximate redshifts of 04 is shown in figure 5 .",
    "there is a low - velocity extension in the histogram at 55,000 km s@xmath12 ( 4 galaxies ) that our 3@xmath39 clipping iterative algorithm ( following danese 1980 ) excludes from the computation of the cluster velocity . from 40",
    "accepted cluster members , we obtain a mean velocity of @xmath41v@xmath42 = 58,909@xmath40142 km  s@xmath12 and a dispersion along the line of sight of @xmath43 km s@xmath12 .",
    "carlberg 1996 found a value of 606@xmath4062 km s@xmath12 for the velocity dispersion of 04 .",
    "they attribute their lower determination of velocity dispersion in a number of clusters to three factors ( see their paper , section 3.3 ) . among them",
    "is the fact that the larger radial range covered by their data makes their data less vulnerable to the presence of local substructures which might affect the velocity dispersion .",
    "figure 5 includes a gaussian distribution centered at the redshift of the cluster , of the appropriate width , and with area normalized to the 40 cluster galaxies . from these data ,",
    "the redshift of the cluster is measured to be 0.1965@xmath400.0005 .    the cfht optical spectrum for galaxy a1 ( see figure 2 and table 1 ) is shown in figure 6 .",
    "the presence of four emission lines in the spectrum unequivocally identifies this galaxy as a lensed background galaxy to the cluster at z=0.5317@xmath400.0003 .",
    "04 was observed by asca ( tanaka , inoue & holt , 1994 ) in september 1994 for 40,000  s. the asca instrumentation consists of two solid - state imaging spectrometers ( sis ) sensitive in the range 0.5@xmath69 kev ( 140 ev resolution at e@xmath06 kev ) , and two gas imaging spectrometers ( gis ) with poorer energy resolution but with some efficiency up to 11 kev .",
    "the sis observations were performed in 4 ccd - bright mode for medium bit rate observations .",
    "data preparation and analysis were done using the xselect and ftools software packages which allow selection of valid time intervals and removal of hot and flickering pixels .",
    "additional analysis was performed using the xspec package . for the spectral analysis we use the summed spectra of the two gis and of sis0 .",
    "sis1 spectrum was not used because of a contamination problem in the detector .",
    "the spatial resolution of asca along with the low signal - to - noise of the data permitted only a global single - temperature raymond - smith model ( raymond and smith 1977 ) to be fitted to the data .",
    "the hydrogen column density was fixed to the galactic value along the line of sight at the cluster position , n@xmath44 cm@xmath19 ( stark 1992 ) , and the heavy elements abundance was fixed to 0.3 of the solar value .",
    "this value was chosen since the typical range of measured abundances for clusters with temperatures between 2 and 6 kev lie between 0.3 and 0.4 solar ( ohashi 1996 ) .",
    "the region containing the qso could not be excluded from the analysis given its proximity to the cluster centre ( 16 , less than the half power diameter of the point spread function of the asca xrt + gis , makishima 1996 ) .",
    "a temperature of @xmath46 kev ( 90% confidence interval ) was measured for the cluster gas .",
    "the inclusion of the qso in the analysis would raise the fitted cluster temperature by only 6.5% .",
    "this variation is within the temperature errors and it is thus negligible for our purposes .",
    "x - ray observations of 04 were obtained with the rosat high resolution imager ( hri , trmper 1983 ) in two pointings in february 1994 and in august 1995 , for a net live time of 27,015  s. the hri operates in the rosat 0.1@xmath62.4 kev energy band and provides an angular resolution of @xmath8  4  ( fwhm ) .",
    "x - ray iso - intensity contours of 04 are shown in figure 7 overlaid on an optical ccd frame .",
    "we first created an x - ray image with a pixel size of 1  and then smoothed the image with a gaussian of @xmath39  =  4 .",
    "the coordinates of the x - ray centroid are @xmath27(j2000 )  =  04@xmath2843@xmath29098 and @xmath47(j2000 )  =  0210195 , corresponding to a position 2  north of galaxy a , and within 15 from the peak of the light distribution .",

    "the position angle of the major axis with respect to the north axis ( counterclockwise positive ) is pa@xmath0120for the innermost isophotes , and pa@xmath49  for the outer isophotes .",

    "the profile is then fit with a @xmath1 model ( cavaliere and fusco - femiano , 1976 ) described by the standard form @xmath62 , with s@xmath63  = central surface brightness , @xmath64 = core radius and @xmath1  =  slope parameter .",

    "figure 8 shows this fit to be well within the errors . using the hri point spread function described in the rosat user s handbook",
    ", we deconvolved an azimuthally symmetric image generated by revolving the fit .",
    "a best fit of the @xmath1 model to the profile of the deconvolved image has parameters @xmath68 and @xmath69 . at the distance of the cluster this core radius corresponds to 26.7 h@xmath15 kpc .",
    "the size of the core radius could indicate the presence of a cooling flow . however , there is no evidence for excess emission in the very core of the cluster , thus any cooling flow must be of marginal significance .",
    "small core radii ( less than 4050 kpc ) and small @xmath1 values ( @xmath8 0.5 ) , such as this cluster seems to have , have been observed recently in other clusters ; see for instance ms1512@xmath43647 ( @xmath70 , @xmath71 ; hamana 1997 ) or our own unpublished hri data for ms2137 - 2353 .",
    "the small size of the core radii and @xmath1s for these x - ray selected clusters is an issue that will be investigated in future work .",
    "the optical morphology of 04 is unusual .",
    "it is a poor cluster with a luminous and compact core ( r=14.8 within 24 ) characterized by the presence of several bright galaxies and numerous fainter ones , all embedded in the low surface brightness halo .",
    "as suggested earlier ( luppino 1993 ) , we may be seeing a cd galaxy in the act of cannibalism .",
    "we have applied a gaussian filter with comparable @xmath39 ( 2  in the hst image and 4  in the x - ray image ) to compare the light and gas distribution of the cluster core .",
    "the x - ray centroid is within 15 from the peak of the light distribution : both distributions have almost circular symmetry with similar ellipticity values ( @xmath72 in optical vs. @xmath73 in x - rays ) .",
    "we now proceed to determine the mass of the cluster from each of three techniques , and compare one with the other .",
    "an estimate of the cluster mass is first attempted using the optical data , via application of the virial theorem . from the virial theorem equation @xmath74 and using the measured @xmath75 km s@xmath12 , a mass of 4.8@xmath76 h@xmath77 is obtained for a value of the three - dimensional virial radius r@xmath78=0.91 h@xmath15 mpc ( r@xmath79 where r@xmath80 is the projected harmonic mean radius ) .",
    "this mass is defined by the radial extent of the region sampled ; it is an underestimate of the total mass if the cluster extends beyond the size of the observed field ( in our case @xmath8 1.5 h@xmath15 mpc ) .",
    "we remind the reader that the accuracy of this method depends on the assumptions that the velocity dispersion is isotropic and that the cluster is no longer undergoing net expansion or contraction .",
    "although there is no concern about isotropy of the x - ray emitting gas , the mass determined using x - ray data does depend on assumptions involving spherical symmetry and hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "these assumptions are found to be valid on the average in n - body simulations studies of cluster formation by schindler ( 1996 ) and evrard ( 1996 ) .",
    "04 does not have any obvious substructure or strong shock wave that could affect the mass determination .",
    "the cluster seems a relatively undisturbed cluster ( see figure 7 ) .",
    "the presence of small bumps may be caused by some motion of collisionless matter and of intracluster gas .",
    "allen ( 1996 ) caution against the use of single - phase analyses with rosat data , since the presence of a cooling flow with distributed mass deposition implies that the central intra cluster medium ( icm ) has a range of temperatures and densities at any particular radius : i.e. the icm is multi - phase .",
    "there is no evidence of any significant cooling flow in 04 , thus we feel that the assumptions adopted for the deprojection outlined below are largely correct . in any case it is not possible to resolve this cluster with _",
    "asca _ , or try to model the temperature as a function of distance from the center of the cluster since there are not enough photons for good limits .",
    "thus in the following we will assume that no temperature gradient is present .    from the hri surface brightness profile , assuming a constant temperature , we have derived the three - dimensional density distribution of the gas from the two - dimensional image by following the deprojection technique of arnaud ( 1988 ) .",

    "we have also deprojected the finely binned x - ray profile of figure 8 assuming the standard @xmath1 model .",
    "our version of this analysis follows .",
    "the volume emissivity , @xmath92 , is found from a deprojection of the profile .",
    "for the standard functional form , the deprojection yields @xmath93 .",
    "the emissivity is proportional to the density squared times the cooling function . if we assume the gas is nearly isothermal , the density is @xmath94 .",

    ", we continue the analysis of the fit to the raw data as well as the fit to the deconvolved data , but , in the end , quote results from the deconvolved data .",
    "if one substitutes the @xmath1 model law into equation  1 , and assumes constant temperature gas , or at least that the density falls off much more rapidly than the temperature , then one finds the following expression for the underlying mass as a function of radius : @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the 1-d velocity dispersion of the gas , and @xmath98 . the @xmath1 model mass distribution for 04 is shown as the dashed line ( fit to deconvolved data ) and dotted line ( fit to raw data ) in figure 10 .",
    "the density distribution of the @xmath1 model is easily evaluated to be of the following form : @xmath99 where @xmath100 .",

    "a finely spaced solution of the density , @xmath110 , is integrated to give @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",

    ", an approximate value for the central density can be derived that matches the @xmath1 model fit to the surface profile , @xmath114    however , a better overall fit is found with @xmath115 at 0.77 times this value , as is shown in figure 11 .",
    "even with some freedom in choosing @xmath101 and @xmath116 , the isothermal sphere model does not adequately fit at all radii .",
    "it appears that the simpler @xmath1 model is , in fact , a better representation of the underlying mass distribution than an isothermal sphere .",
    "a reconstruction of the arc images to background source galaxies was attempted using the morphological information in the hst images . as with other previously known lensing clusters ( kneib 1996 ; smail 1997 among others ) the high resolution of wfpc2 reveals significantly more lensed features than by using ground - based telescopes .",
    "several arcs in 04 are resolved by the hst into bright knots .",
    "others like arc a1 which appeared as the most prominent arc from the ground data , is actually a distorted image of a galaxy but not necessarily a strong lensed object",
    ". we will follow and extend the nomenclature in luppino ( 1993 ) for both the galaxy names and the arcs .",
    "however , with the hst resolution available , we now think that objects labelled as a10 , a14 and a15 are not strong arcs and they are not labelled in figure 2 .",
    "arc a11 , which may be an arc , is out of the field of view of this image .",
    "a solution is obtained assuming a flattened potential ( blandford and kochanek , 1987 ) ,    @xmath117    where @xmath101 is the angular extent of the core radius , x is the run along the major axis in units of @xmath101 , and y is the run along the minor axis . a position angle to align coordinates with the major axis must also be specified .",
    "the parameters @xmath118 , @xmath101 , and @xmath119 are simply fitting parameters and are not easily converted to any real physical quantities except in the @xmath120 case .",
    "the observed position in the plane of the sky @xmath121 is related to the source position @xmath122 by , @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the comoving angular diameter distance of the source and @xmath125 is the comoving angular diameter distance of the source as seen by the lensing cluster ( hammer and nottale , 1986 ; peebles , 1993 ) .",
    "the full set of free parameters is : ( x , y ) position of center , position angle on the sky , @xmath101 , @xmath27 , @xmath119 , @xmath118 , and the redshifts of all source objects .",
    "we do not restrict the model by the observed light distribution . in the end ,",
    "the light and matter can be compared and information can be gleaned as to the degree to which the potential follows the light distribution .",
    "the main difficulty stems from properly identifying which sets of arcs are to be associated as being counter images of the same source .",
    "the details of the model will be presented in shaya ( 1998 ) . here",
    "we present the results obtained for the mass determination . since we do not have a redshift for any multi - arc system",
    ", we can obtain only upper limits to the mass and lower limits to the redshift .",
    "an upper limit to the mass derives from the fact that no credible counter image is found for arc 1 , the arc with known redshift .",
    "a lower limit ultimately derives from the fact that the term @xmath126 , in standard cosmologies with @xmath127 = 1.0 ( 0.1 ) , approaches the finite value of 0.91 ( 0.84 ) as the redshift of the source goes to infinity .",
    "crude estimates for the values of the model parameters were first established by solving for the case that the pattern of 4 knots in a5 corresponds to the 4 knots in a6 . with this model",
    "in hand one could explore different source plane distances to see what other arcs are counter images of each other .",
    "when another was found , a @xmath128 minimization program to bring the knots of both systems together in the source plane provided more highly constrained values on the model parameters .",
    "this procedure was repeated , with more terms in the @xmath128 each round , until no new set of counter images could be seen .",
    "if an incorrect association is made between arcs , then poor values for the parameters are assumed and this will lead to a dead end , in the sense that no new systems will be found .",
    "one must then back up and try a different pairing that will lead to further progress .",
    "the following sets of arcs were found to be associated with their own source object with the range in redshifts set by the two limiting models : arcs 5 and 6 ( 0.60 @xmath41 z @xmath41 1.6 ) , arcs 8 , 9 , 12 and 24 ( 0.53 @xmath41 z @xmath41 1.1 ) , radial arc 17 and arc 18 ( 0.59 @xmath41 z @xmath411.5 ) , arc 7 and radial arc 16 ( 0.59 @xmath41 z @xmath41 1.5 ) , and arcs 2 , 3 , 20 and the faint , extreme southern extension of a9 ( 0.75 @xmath41 z @xmath41 @xmath129 ) .",
    "a best solution that solves for these arcs simultaneously requires values for @xmath130 , and for @xmath131 corresponding to 6.4 h@xmath15 kpc , a position angle of @xmath132 , and @xmath133 .",
    "however , these are uncorrelated errors . for correlated errors in which all of the other parameters are permitted to change as each parameter is tested , the errors in position angle and ellipticity are @xmath134 and 0.03 , respectively .",
    "the core radius could be varied from 0 to 335 ( within 1 @xmath39 in @xmath128 ) .",
    "the value for @xmath27 could be varied between 0.74 and 0.97 with little penalty in @xmath128 except at the edges of this range .",
    "the ellipticity in the lensing model reflects the ellipticity of the potential .",
    "it is expected to be about one third of the ellipticity of the underlying mass distribution ( mellier 1993 ) . here",
    ", we find a ratio between the light distribution and the potential ellipticities of 2:1 .",
    "it appears , therefore , that the value of the ellipticity of the light distribution is intermediate between that of the potential and the mass .    arcs",
    "5 and 6 identified in figure 2 provide an important constraint on the mass geometry because a single source , with consistent complex structure , explains both .",
    "we failed to associate arc 1 , the only arc with known redshift at z@xmath00.5317 , with any counter image .",
    "if this is , indeed , because there is only one image , it provides an upper limit to the mass . for the maximal mass model , arc 1",
    "is allowed to be just beginning to form a counter image . at this point",
    ", the source image of arc 1 is becoming alarmingly distended in a direction pointing toward the center .",
    "thus a potential greater than the maximal mass model is unlikely , based solely on the form of the source image of arc 1 .",
    "the projected mass as a function of radius for x - ray data and lens modelling is presented in figure 12 .",
    "out to the radius of 40 kpc , the x - ray mass model has just barely enough mass to be consistent with the lens mass . by 100 kpc , the outermost radius with strong lensing , the x - ray mass model appears to fall about a factor of 1.5 to 2 too low .",
    "the errors in the x - ray determined mass , are @xmath135 ( 90% confidence ) after folding in errors in asca determined temperature with uncertainty in individual bin counts .",
    "therefore , perhaps our model is too simple .",
    "the model that we describe below is presented as a possible way to reconcile the x - ray and lensing mass . just adding a little more complexity to the model , and one that is well motivated by the complex structures observed on large scales , the x - ray and lens mass determinations can be reconciled",
    ". there may be other similarly complex models that resolve the mass discrepancy . here",
    "we prove only the existence of a solution , not uniqueness .",
    "it needs to be noted that the path followed by light from background sources is affected by the mass of the entire column through the line of sight .",
    "it may be that the projection of just the cluster does not fully represent the total mass in the column . as a next simplest model",
    ", we look for a mass distribution made up of two isothermal spheres centered on the cluster which distributes the hot gas in such a way so that its surface brightness remains consistent with the observed x - ray brightness profile , but has a projected mass consistent with the gravitational lens results .",
    "it is true that we are extrapolating beyond the last point at which the gas could have been heated sufficiently to radiate x - rays .",
    "we are trying to reconcile here the disparity between x - ray determined mass and gravitational lens mass plus we are trying to understand the steep slope of the gravitational lens mass .",
    "both problems are best dealt with by the proposed theory that clusters are embedded in superclusters .",
    "it is exactly the lack of information in the x - ray gas at large radii which we are exploiting to find a single model that fits both the x - ray and the gravitational lens .",
    "a solution is found with one isothermal sphere of core radius unchanged from the previous analysis but with a second sphere with core radius between 30  50 times larger .",
    "for definiteness , we show a solution with 40 times larger core radius , @xmath136 mpc .",
    "the second component sphere has a central density 150 times less than the first component .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the second component is then @xmath137 times that of the first component , which put it at nearly @xmath138 km s@xmath12 .",
    "it is unclear , however , whether this component should be attributed to a second , warmer dark matter particle , or ( more likely ) to late fall into the cluster .",
    "figure 13 compares the new density distribution ( dash - dots ) with the two from the previous sections , the @xmath1 model ( dotted ) and the single isothermal sphere ( dashed ) .",
    "the mass enclosed at each radius is presented in figure 14 .",
    "although we continue the distribution out to 10 mpc where it reaches a total mass of @xmath139 , the distribution could start falling off at a few mpc with little effect in what follows .",
    "the hump in the density and mass distributions beginning at a few 100 kpc could simply be a representation of the supercluster within which the cluster resides .",
    "in fact the total mass within 10 mpc is quite reasonable for a major supercluster such as the coma supercluster or the great attractor .",
    "we again use equation  6 to calculate the expected x - ray profile and to set the normalization of @xmath140 .",
    "this time the fit ( figure 15 ) fits well over most of the range but , admittedly , is a little low at 300 kpc , but it is nonetheless acceptable . the signal - to - noise is low at these radii and many of the bins give only upper limits .",
    "a slight error in background subtraction may contribute to the small discrepancies .",
    "finally , the dash - dot line in figure 12 shows the projection of the 2-isothermal spheres model and it appears to just fit the minimum mass model both in terms of slope and amplitude .",
    "the explanation then for the discrepancy between the x - ray determined mass and the gravitational lens mass might simply be the fact that the x - ray mass is not sensitive to the larger scale structure within which the cluster is embedded .",
    "we have not yet explored how sensitive the results are to coalignment of these two potentials . in future work",
    ", we will examine how stringent is the requirement for the cluster to be at the center of the larger scale structure .",
    "other alternatives for the cause of discrepancy include the possibility of temperature variations in the x - ray gas .",
    "we will have to wait for better x - ray spectroscopy with _",
    "axaf _ since _ asca _ can not resolve this cluster .",
    "bartelmann and steinmetz ( 1996 ) suggested that the presence of substructure and line - of - sight alignments of material towards the cluster core may contribute to the discrepancy observed , since they will increase the probability of detecting gravitational arcs in the clusters and thus enhance the lensing masses , without significantly affecting the x - ray data .",
    "the mass model prediction presented here will be tested by the weak lensing modelling which is underway by members of our team .",
    "the details may disagree because the supercluster is not expected to be spherically symmetric .",
    "the strong lens model examined in this paper is sensitive to the distribution along the line of sight to the center while the weak lensing will examine the distribution at large distances in the other two dimensions .",
    "the observational data from a multiwavelength study of the cluster 04 have been presented , together with the analysis of the mass distribution as obtained by several techniques . for the hst / wfpc2 image , we focused on modelling of the gravitational lensed arcs distributed in the inner @xmath141 radius .",
    "ground based telescopes were used to obtain the velocity dispersion of the galaxies in the cluster and determine the virial mass .",
    "asca _ data to derive a temperature for the x - ray gas .",
    "rosat / hri _ image was used to derive an emission profile which is analyzed , assuming that the hot gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium and in a spherical potential , to derive the form of the cluster potential .    from possible multiple images formed by gravitational lensing of 5 background sources ,",
    "we have derived limits to the mass distribution in the range 50 ",
    "100 h@xmath15 kpc in 04 . for the central 24  ( 100 h@xmath15 kpc ) region encircled by the arcs ,",
    "the possible range in projected mass is @xmath142 h@xmath77 .",
    "the mass profile appears to grow with radius considerably more rapidly than an isothermal model or a @xmath1 model .",
    "we have also used x - ray data to obtain a mass distribution from the inner few kpc out to nearly 600 h@xmath15 kpc .",
    "there is no evidence for excess emission in the very core of the cluster which could indicate the existence of a cooling flow , thus justifying the assumption of constant temperature for the deprojection technique .",
    "the mass distribution obtained is well fit by a @xmath1 model , described here , but not well fit by a single isothermal distribution .",
    "the x - ray derived projected mass profile is below the lensing mass profile . at 50 h@xmath15 kpc ,",
    "it is 20% below , which is just within the errors , but by 100 h@xmath15 kpc it is a factor of 2 below .",
    "however , more general models fit the data better and allow a wider range of masses that are consistent with the lensing data .    the virial mass derived from the galaxy velocity dispersion ,",
    "@xmath143 h@xmath77 is intermediate between the extrapolations to 900 h@xmath15 kpc of the other two profiles . as in other cases reported in the literature",
    "we find discrepancy between the x - ray and lensing estimates .",
    "we tentatively explore the possibility of reconciling these mass estimates with a mass profile that increases more rapidly than the x - ray @xmath1 model at large radii .",
    "the model explored is one with two isothermal spheres ; one has a core radius of 26.7 h@xmath15 kpc and the other core radius is 1 h@xmath15 mpc .",
    "the central densities for the two components have a ratio of 150:1 . with these parameters ,",
    "a fit to the x - ray profile is reasonable and the projected mass profile is consistent with the minimum mass model for the gravitationally lensed arcs .",
    "the total mass out to 10 mpc required by this model is about @xmath144 h@xmath77 , which could indicate the existence of a supercluster of galaxies with a mass comparable to the coma supercluster or the great attractor .",
    "other alternatives for the discrepancy of the mass estimates include : a temperature gradient in the x - ray gas that may conspire against the models used ; or the lensing mass could be higher because of line of sight projection effects .",
    "the asymmetric velocity distribution of the galaxies and its low end extension could be an indication that the mass of the cluster is not spherically distributed .",
    "similarly to other investigators we have found a discrepancy between the x - ray and lensing mass determination ( see among others miralda - escud and babul , 1995 ; kneib 1995 or the exhaustive list of references in wu and fang , 1996 , 1997 ) . differently from other lensing clusters with x - ray data ,",
    "04 does not give evidence of any ongoing merger which could severely disturb the intracluster gas ( i.e. like a2218 , kneib 1995 ; a370 , mellier 1994 ) and thus explain the discrepancy .",
    "the simple model presented here could be tested by : 1 ) a much deeper x - ray map showing more details of the behavior of the surface brightness profile ( it may provide evidence of a second , large scale component ) but a much larger field of view than that given by hri would be necessary ; 2 ) detection of a temperature gradient , possible with higher resolution instruments as the ones which will be flown on axaf ; 3 ) weak lensing analysis to greater radii using the large ccd mosaic camera with 8100@xmath548100 pixels ( metzger , luppino and miyazaki , 1995 ) which will obtain wide field images of clusters at relatively low redshift such as the one presented here .",

    "<S> models of the cluster mass distribution and its lensing properties reveal 5 background sources at various redshifts each forming 2 or more arcs . </S>",
    "<S> we do not have a redshift for any arc with multiple images , therefore we can only place upper and lower limits to the mass of the cluster from gravitational lensing . at 100 kpc , </S>",
    "<S> the lower limit mass from lensing is about a factor of 2 greater than the x - ray determined mass . </S>",
    "<S> the rate of increase in the projected mass at this radius also is greater for the lens model than the x - ray determination . to reconcile the mass estimates from the x - rays and the lensing and to try to understand the steep slope of the gravitational lens mass , we tentatively explore a model with a supercluster surrounding the cluster and with a mass profile that increases more rapidly than a @xmath1 model at large radii .    04ms0440@xmath40204 </S>"
