    "the capability to grow nanoscale layers of atoms or molecules on a substrate forms an important part of modern nanotechnology .",
    "particles emitted from a source are deposited on the growing surface whose characteristics are determined by parameters such as growth temperature , surface diffusion , bulk relaxation , and particle attachment vs detachment rates .",
    "in addition to being clearly relevant for device applications , such surface growth problems also constitute an important class of generic nonequilibrium phenomena @xcite which can not be described in terms of standard equilibrium ensemble theory .",
    "a key goal of both theoretical and experimental investigations is the characterization and understanding of the resulting surface morphology , especially in terms of its statistical properties such as spatial and temporal height - height correlations .",
    "while local features may play an important role for device performance , large - scale , long - time characteristics offer better opportunities for theoretical understanding .",
    "they are often universal , i.e. , independent of microscopic details , depending only on global constraints such as symmetries and conservation laws . here",
    ", we will explore the consequences of a _ reduced _ symmetry , which results if the particles arrive under an oblique ( non - normal ) angle .",
    "let us briefly review different classes of models for surface growth .",
    "the first issue is whether surface overhangs and shadowing effects can be neglected . for models with near - grazing incidence ,",
    "this is usually a poor approximation .",
    "focusing on vapor - deposited thin films , meakin and krug @xcite considered ballistic deposition under these conditions .",
    "they found that columnar patterns form which shield parts of the growing surface from incoming particles and characterized these structures in terms of anisotropic scaling exponents , differentiating parallel and transverse directions @xcite .",
    "in contrast , for normal or near - normal incidence , overhangs and shadowing can often be neglected , and a description in term of a stochastic equation of motion for a single - valued height variable becomes possible .",
    "a second important issue is whether particles , once attached to the surface , can desorb again .",
    "if desorption does occur , the surface relaxation is not conserved , and the _ leading _ nonlinearity in the langevin equation is of the kardar - parisi - zhang form @xcite .",
    "models of this type are most appropriate for chemical vapor deposition ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and sputtering processes @xcite .",
    "anisotropies have also been included by different authors @xcite .",
    "in contrast , desorption can often be neglected in mbe - type processes which occur at low growth temperatures ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in this case , the surface relaxation terms in the langevin equation conserve the number of particles . for models of this type ,",
    "the universal behavior depends on whether the incident beam is normal to the substrate or not . for normal incidence ,",
    "the system remains isotropic on large scales while oblique incidence generates anisotropies which persist under coarse - graining .",
    "while the former case has been investigated extensively ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , only partial results are available for the latter @xcite . noting that the reduced symmetry generates novel leading nonlinearities suggesting potentially distinct universal behavior , we consider surface growth under oblique incidence more systematically in the following .",
    "our analysis begins with a model first suggested by marsili _",
    "_ @xcite to describe mbe - type or ballistic deposition processes with oblique particle incidence . based on a coarse - grained description in terms of a langevin equation",
    ", the model adopts an idealized perspective @xcite , neglecting particle desorption and bulk defect formation . as a result ,",
    "the surface relaxation becomes mass - conserving and can be written as the gradient of a current , in an appropriate reference frame .",
    "in contrast , the noise term in the langevin equation is not mass - conserving , since it models the random arrivals of particles .",
    "anisotropies emerge naturally in the langevin equation , since the particle beam selects a preferred ( `` parallel '' ) direction in the substrate plane . extending the analysis of @xcite",
    ", we explore the consequences of an effective anisotropic surface tension .",
    "generated by the interplay of interatomic interactions and kinetic effects , such as schwoebel barriers , it plays a central role for the long - time , long - distance properties of the model . due to the anisotropy , it will generically take different values , denoted @xmath0 and @xmath1 , in the parallel and transverse directions . depending on which of these parameters vanishes first , ripple - like surface instabilities are expected , aligned transverse to the soft direction .",
    "this leads to four different regimes with potentially scale - invariant behaviors .",
    "we analyze these four regimes , identify the scale - invariant ones , and discuss the associated anisotropic roughness exponents , using techniques from renormalized field theory .",
    "the original theory of @xcite is recovered only if both couplings , @xmath0 _ and _ @xmath1 , vanish simultaneously .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first present the underlying langevin equation for a single - valued height field and briefly review the physical origin of its constituents .",
    "we also give a full discussion of its symmetries which are important for the subsequent analysis .",
    "we then turn to the renormalization group ( rg ) analysis . identifying a set of effective coupling constants , and exploiting a ward identity following from a ( continuous ) tilt invariance ,",
    "we compute the naively divergent one - particle irreducible ( 1pi )  vertex functions to one - loop order near the upper critical dimension .",
    "we analyze the four different cases separately :  ( o ) both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are positive ; ( i ) @xmath0 remains positive while @xmath1 vanishes ; ( ii ) @xmath0 vanishes while @xmath1 remains positive ; and finally , ( iii ) both @xmath0 and @xmath1 vanish simultaneously .",
    "a renormalization group equation allows us to derive the scaling properties of correlation and response functions for those cases which possess infrared ( ir )  stable fixed points .",
    "we identify a complete set of critical exponents , including _ four different _ roughness exponents for each case .",
    "two of these characterize real - space scans along and transverse to the beam direction , and the remaining two are needed to describe scattering ( i.e. momentum space ) data with parallel or transverse momentum transfer .",

    "@xmath6 is measured along the @xmath7-axis which is normal to the substrate plane .",

    "even if we follow @xcite and set it to zero in the bare theory , it is actually generated under rg transformations and therefore intrinsically present .",
    "second , the full rotational symmetry within the @xmath4-dimensional space of the substrate is broken by the nonlinear term in eq .",
    "( [ music ] ) . as a consequence ,",
    "any coarse - graining of the microscopic theory should give rise to different couplings in the parallel and transverse subspaces , and this is in fact borne out under the renormalization group . if the full anisotropy is incorporated into the theory , restricting rotational invariance to the @xmath19-dimensional _ transverse _ subspace , the langevin equation ( [ generic_langevin ] ) takes the form @xmath20 after some minor renamings . here , @xmath21",

    "however , one could imagine situations where diffusion is extremely fast , and aggregation occurs only very infrequently , so that eq .",

    "we can gain some qualitative insight by considering the linear terms first . to ensure stability of the homogeneous phase , the coupling constants @xmath32 and @xmath33 must be positive , and the cross - coupling @xmath34 may not exceed @xmath35 .",
    "the two couplings @xmath36 and @xmath37 play the role of critical parameters .",
    "if both are positive , the nonlinearities become irrelevant , and the problem reduces to the ( gaussian )  edwards - wilkinson equation @xcite . in contrast , if one or both of them vanish , the surface develops characteristic spatial structures .",
    "these take the form of ripples ( reminiscent of corrugated roofing ) , if only one of the two couplings goes through zero ; if both couplings become negative , the surface develops mounds or `` wedding cakes ''  @xcite .",
    "focusing only on the onset of these instabilities , four different cases emerge which are discussed systematically in the following section : ( o ) the linear theory @xmath38 , @xmath39 ; ( i ) a line of continuous transitions @xmath38 , @xmath40 ; ( ii ) a line of _ possibly first _",

    "we consider the symmetries exhibited by ( [ def_j ] ) since they place constraints on possible counterterms .",
    "the invariance against a shift of coordinates in the @xmath7-direction leads to the symmetry @xmath47 .",

    "if the regularization procedure respects the symmetries of the model , then the remaining primitive divergences also preserve the symmetries .",
    "thus , these divergences have the same form as the relevant terms of the initial model and their counterterms can be absorbed in a renormalization of the initial parameters .",
    "this presumes , of course , that all relevant interaction terms ( i.e. , composite fields with coupling constants of positive naive dimension ) with the correct symmetries have been included in the initial dynamic functional , and all irrelevant couplings have been omitted . with regards to our model",
