    "the @xmath4 are positive integers : evaluating a schubert polynomial at certain chern classes gives a schubert class in the cohomology of the flag manifold .",
    "hence , @xmath4 enumerates the flags in a suitable triple intersection of schubert varieties .",

    "has previously been noted  @xcite . a new proof of the classical pieri s formula for grassmannians  @xcite suggests a geometric rationale for such ` chain - theoretic ' formulas .",
    "lastly , known formulas for these constants , particularly monk s formula  @xcite , pieri - type formulas ( first stated by lascoux and schtzenberger  @xcite but only recently given proofs using geometry  @xcite and algebra  @xcite ) , and other formulas of  @xcite , are all of this form . recently ,",
    "ciocan - fontanine  @xcite has generalized these chain - theoretic pieri - type formulas to the quantum cohomology rings of manifolds of partial flags .",
    "this has also been announced  @xcite in the special case of quantum schubert polynomials  @xcite . in  [ sec : chains_and_orders ] , we give a refinement of  ( [ eq : expected_rule ] ) .",

    "when @xmath10 is a schur polynomial , we give a chain - theoretic interpretation ( theorem  [ thm : skew_shape ] ) for some @xmath7 , determine many more ( theorem  [ thm : skew_permutation ] ) in terms of the classical littlewood - richardson coefficients , and show how a map that takes certain chains in the bruhat order to standard young tableaux and satisfies some additional properties would give a combinatorial interpretation for these @xmath7 ( theorem  [ thm : combinatorial ] ) .",
    "most of these identities have an order - theoretic companion which could imply them , were a description such as ( [ eq : expected_rule ] ) known .",
    "the one identity ( theorem  [ thm : d ] ) lacking such a companion yields a new result about the enumeration of chains in the bruhat order ( corollary  [ cor : equal_chains ] ) . in  [ sec : orders ] , we study a suborder called the @xmath11-bruhat order , which is relevant in ( [ eq : expected_rule ] ) when @xmath10 is schur symmetric polynomial in @xmath12 .",
    "this leads to a new graded partial order on @xmath1 containing every interval in young s lattice as an induced suborder for which many group homomorphisms are order preserving ( theorem  [ thm : new_order ] ) .",

    "we expect the identities established here will similarly lead to some beautiful combinatorics , once a combinatorial interpretation for the @xmath7 is known .",
