    "stellar bars in disk galaxies have long been recognized as powerful tools to transport interstellar gas toward galactic centers ( e.g. , @xcite ; simkin , su , & schwarz 1980 ) .",
    "gravitational torques from bars are much more efficient in gas transport on galactic scale than viscous torques ( combes , dupraz , & gerin 1990 )",
    ". typically gas inflow rates of the order of 0.1  10  have been obtained in numerical simulations of barred galaxies with ordinary amount of gas ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "two consequences of the bar - driven gas transport have been extensively investigated ; fueling to ( circum)nuclear star formation and to active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , and secular evolution of galaxies involving bar dissolution and bulge growth .",
    "bursts of star formation in galactic centers ( @xmath0 kpc ) consume @xmath7  @xmath2  of gas in @xmath7 ",
    "@xmath4 years ( @xcite ) , and thus need the supply of gas as bars can provide .",
    "active nuclei in barred galaxies may also benefit from the larger supply of infalling gas , though additional mechanisms may be necessary to deliver the gas from @xmath8 kpc to the nucleus ( shlosman , frank , & begelman 1989 ) .",
    "another aspect of the bar - driven gas transport is a significant mass transfer in galactic disks , possibly followed by drastic changes in the dynamical structure of galaxies .",
    "it is predicted that bars are destroyed if the bar - driven mass concentration at the nuclei is large enough , and that some of disk stars are added to bulges as a result of the bar dissolution ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it has been inferred therefore that the formation - dissolution cycle of bars forces spiral galaxies to evolve from late to early hubble types , in the direction of increasing bulge - to - disk ratios ( @xcite ; hasan , pfenniger , & norman 1993 ) .    on the observational side ,",
    "there are three major pieces of evidence for bar - driven gas transport ; metallicity gradients in galactic disks , estimates of gas inflow rates in a few barred galaxies , and statistics on  luminosity ( and other tracers of star formation ) in galactic centers .",
    "the radial gradients of metallicity in galactic disks are shallower in barred galaxies than in unbarred galaxies ( @xcite ; zaritsky , kennicutt , & huchra 1994 ; @xcite )",
    ". the shallower gradients in barred systems are attributed to better mixing of interstellar medium by bars .",
    "metallicity gradients tell time - averaged effects of the bar - driven gas transfer , because the gradients are over galactic disks and hence vary on timescales larger than the dynamical time of the disks .",
    "estimates of gas inflow rate in barred galaxies have been obtained using near - ir and/or co observations , but only in a few objects .",
    "quillen  ( 1995 ) constructed a mass model of the bar in ngc 7479 from optical and near - ir images , calculated the torques to be exerted on the molecular gas seen in co , and estimated a mass inflow rate .",
    "benedict , smith , & kenney ( 1996 ) detected in co large inward velocities at two positions near the center of a barred galaxy ngc 4314 and suggested a gas inflow , though the proof of net inflow was not provided .",
    "regan , vogel , & teuben ( 1997 ) compared the  velocities in a barred galaxy ngc 1530 with hydrodynamical models and gas distributions to calculate the mass inflow rate .",
    "the estimated rates of gas flow are of the order of 0.110   all directed inward .",
    "there is , however , a fundamental difficulty in the observational estimation of mass inflow .",
    "the gas flux into a region is a line integral ( on the boundary of the region ) of gas mass multiplied by inward velocity normal to the boundary .",
    "the inward velocities are not observable on the minor axis of a galaxy , and thus the inflow rate can not be usually measured without a gas dynamics model ( e.g. , regan  1997 ) .",
    "the model usually needs multi - wavelength observations and assumptions on the mass - to - luminosity ratio , gas properties , the pattern speed of the bar , etc .",
    "statistics on the gas inflow rates have not been obtained in this way , presumably owing to the complexity of the method .",
    "the estimated rates of gas inflow are current and instantaneous values , though they probably vary .",
    "luminosities of  and other tracers of star formation tend to be higher in the centers of barred galaxies than their unbarred counterparts ( ir , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; radio , @xcite ; , ho , filippenko , & sargent 1997b , among others ) .",
    "the enhanced star formation rates ( sfrs ) in barred nuclei have been attributed to abundant star - forming gas accumulated by bars , in an assumption that star formation efficiency is not systematically different in barred and unbarred nuclei .",
    "it has been also reported that the higher sfr in barred nuclei is evident in early - type spirals ( s0/a  sbc ) but not so in late - type spirals ( sc  sm ) , which is attributed to different properties of the bars ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the sfrs in galactic centers reflect time - integrated properties of bar - driven gas transport , because a central sfr likely correlates better with the amount of gas currently in the galactic center than with the rate of gas inflow to that region .",
    "nevertheless the information provided by sfrs is statistical , and one can not tell much about the amount of gas in galactic centers because star formation efficiency is hardly constant over time or among galaxies .",
    "although all the pieces of evidence reviewed above point to bar - driven transport of gas to galactic centers , the evidence from direct observations of molecular gas , which is the gas to be transported in the inner regions of galaxies , has been very limited ; and evidence from statistical studies of molecular gas is largely lacking .",
    "the only study based on observations of molecular gas in a sample of galaxies is , to our knowledge , that by nishiyama ( 1995 ) who measured radial distributions of co in disk galaxies at kpc resolutions .",
    "excess gas in barred nuclei was suggested and attributed to viscous accretion ( due to different rotation curves in barred and unbarred systems ) and bar - driven accretion , though the statistical test for the excess was not provided .",
    "observations of a broad sample of barred and unbarred galaxies are needed in order to clarify whether there really is more molecular gas in the centers of barred systems , how much gas there is and how the gas is distributed in galactic centers , and how the gas is related to nuclear star formation and agn .    in this paper",
    ", we use the nro - ovro survey of nearby spiral galaxies ( @xcite ) to address the issues on bar - driven gas transport and its consequences .",
    "we show that condensations of molecular gas with sizes @xmath0 kpc and masses @xmath4@xmath2   are frequently seen at the centers of spiral galaxies , that the degree of gas concentration to the central kpc is higher in barred galaxies than unbarred systems , and that the amount of molecular gas in the central kpc does not correlate with the optical classification of nuclear activity ( agn or star formation ) .",
    "the higher gas concentration in barred galaxies is not only an important addition to the evidence for bar - driven gas transport but also a constraint to the rate of mass inflow and the fate of bars .",
    "the lack of correlation between the central gas mass and a detectable agn forces us to reconsider the relation between gas and agn .",
    "our co(j=10 ) imaging survey was conducted toward the central regions of 20 nearby spiral galaxies using the millimeter - wave interferometers at the nobeyama radio observatory ( nro ) and the owens valley radio observatory ( ovro ) .",
    "the principal goal of the survey was to determine the distribution and kinematics of molecular gas in a sample of nearby spiral galaxies selected with little bias on their morphologies and activities ( such as starburst and seyfert nuclei ) .",
    "it was intended that the survey provided a basic dataset for statistical studies on gas properties and gas - related phenomena in spiral galaxies .",
    "a companion paper ( @xcite , hereafter paper i ) gives details of the design and basic results of the survey ; relevant points are summarized below .",
    "the 20 galaxies were selected with the following four criteria : ( 1 ) inclination @xmath9 ; ( 2 ) declination @xmath10 ; ( 3 ) integrated co intensity @xmath11 @xmath12 in at least one position in the galaxy ( usually at the center ) in the fcrao extragalactic co survey ( @xcite ; @xcite ) ; and ( 4 ) no evidence of significant perturbation ( e.g. , merging ) .",
    "all galaxies satisfying the above criteria except ugc 2855 were observed .",
    "no selection was made on the basis of nuclear activity , far - ir luminosity , and bar properties .",
    "the parameters of the sample galaxies are listed in table [ t.sample ] .",

    "the standard sensitivity of the survey was 40 mjy  ( @xmath16 ) for a velocity resolution of 10 , equivalent to @xmath17 k for a 4  beam .",

    "the galactic centers marked in the maps are from paper i and are mostly dynamical centers determined from our co observations .",
    "the central peaks of co emission , which we call central gas condensations , are often very sharp and distinct and sometimes made of twin peaks or other subfeatures .",
    "the analysis of radial co distributions in paper i showed that co integrated intensities fall to @xmath19 of the central peaks at radii less than 500 pc in half of the galaxies , and at radii less than 1 kpc in 3/4 of the sample .",
    "these scale lengths of the nuclear co emission are much smaller than the scale lengths of gas distributions in disks , which are usually @xmath20 a few kpc .",
    "the sub - kpc scale lengths are not artifacts of aperture synthesis observations , because we detected most of total flux ( see discussion in paper i ) .",

    "the gas - to - dynamical mass ratio is typically 0.1 , and 0.3 at maximum .",
    "the error of the keplerian dynamical mass due to the flatness of mass distribution is at most 30 % for an exponential disk ( @xcite ) . we did not attempt to subtract the effect of noncircular motions , because it needs detailed modeling of mass distribution and gas dynamics in individual galaxies ( see , e.g. , wada , sakamoto , & minezaki 1998 ) .",
    "the effects of noncircular motions tend to cancel out in statistical sense if many barred galaxies are observed from random viewing angles ( see appendix b of paper i ) .    ",
    "[ f.mgasmdyn ]     compact co condensations at galactic centers , such as seen in this survey , have been seen in the galaxy ( sanders , solomon , & scoville 1984 ) and in other nearby galaxies , e.g. , ngc 1068 ( planesas , scoville , & myers 1991 ) and four galaxies in kenney  ( 1992 ) , in which three have twin - peak structure within the condensations .",
    "the scale ( size and co - derived mass ) of these co cores is similar to that found in our survey . taken together , compact co peaks ( or central gas condensations ) with sizes @xmath30 1 kpc and co - derived masses @xmath31  appear to be prevalent in large ( @xmath3 ) galaxies , though there are certainly galaxies without such co condensations ( e.g. , m31 , @xcite ; m33 , @xcite ; ngc 4414 , @xcite ) .",
    "the most straightforward interpretation of the central co peaks is that they are condensations of molecular gas at galactic centers , probably caused by dynamical mechanisms such as bar - induced transport of gas .",
    "detailed analysis of one of the sample galaxies , ngc 4321 , showed that it was indeed the case for this moderately barred galaxy ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "another possible interpretation of the co condensations is that they are due to enhanced co emissivity per unit mass of molecular gas , presumably caused by extreme physical conditions in galactic centers such as high pressure causing partly pressure - bound clouds ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is often argued that the co - to-  conversion factor @xmath25  in the galactic disk , which we adopt , may overestimate the gas mass in the galactic center ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it has not been possible , however , to determine the @xmath25   in each galactic center of our sample using the techniques applied for the galactic center , and thus there has been no direct evidence that co emissivities are high in the galaxies with co cores .",
    "we note that the gas - to - dynamical mass ratios in the central kpc of our sample , @xmath32 , are not very high but comparable to that in the galactic disk ( @xcite ) , which seems to make it unlikely that the gas masses in the central regions are significantly overestimated with the galactic conversion factor .",
    "we also note that the variation of the central gas masses in our sample , about an order of magnitude , is unlikely to be dominated by a random variation of @xmath25 .",
    "it is because if the @xmath25  in the galactic centers have a random scatter of a factor of @xmath33 then there would be no reasonable explanation for the correlation ( discussed in  [ s.concentration ] ) between bars and the degree of gas ( co ) concentration .",
    "therefore we interpret the co condensations to be mostly due to peaks of molecular gas rather than enhanced co emissivity , though of course some errors in the derived gas masses may exist .",
    "we also have to consider whether the prevalence of the central co peaks is due to some bias in our sample selection .",
    "the selection using single - dish co flux certainly precludes galaxies devoid of co emission in the central kiloparsecs .",
    "however , it is not directly biased toward galaxies with sub - kpc co cores , because the single - dish beam ( 3.3 kpc in fwhm on average ) is much larger than sub - kpc and hence the co emission could be more uniformly distributed in the central few kpc .",
    "on the other hand , it is predicted that self - gravity of molecular gas , combined with perturbations from a bar or oval distortion , can efficiently drive the gas to the nucleus ( @xcite ) .",
    "our sample consists of galaxies with larger amount of molecular gas in their central regions than average ( provided that co luminosity traces gas mass ) .",
    "thus , it is possible that the fraction of galaxies with central gas condensations is high in our sample because of the self - gravitational gas inflow .",
    "to quantify the degree of gas concentration in each galaxy we use the ratio of the surface density of molecular gas averaged over the central kpc and that averaged over the whole optical disk , i.e. , @xmath34 the central surface density , , is from our observations and the disk - averaged surface density , , is from the total co flux of the galaxy ( young  1995 ) and the galaxy s de vaucouleurs radius @xmath35 , which is the radius at a @xmath36-band surface brightness of 25 mag arcsec@xmath37 .",
    "young  ( 1995 ) observed co emission along the major axes of the galaxies at 45  resolution to at least half of the optical radii @xmath35 , and , if co emission was detected at multiple positions , extended the observations until no detectable emission was seen .",
    "the total co fluxes were estimated from the radial distributions with uncertainties of @xmath38 % ( @xcite ) .",
    "the surface densities and the concentration factors are listed in table [ t.sample ] .",
    "the concentration factor @xmath39  is robust against many possible biases as an index of gas concentration in galactic disks .",
    "first , it indicates the degree of gas concentration better than the amount of gas in the central region ( e.g. , @xmath40 ) because @xmath39  is not affected by the total amount of gas in the galaxy .",
    "second , @xmath39  does not depend on galaxy distance if the distance is correct .",
    "a distance error would affect  through the size of the averaging area but would not affect .",
    "third , the missing flux in our observations does not change  much , not only because we detected most of total flux but also because the extended missing flux must have much lower surface densities in the central kpc than the detected emission that is peaked at most galactic centers .",
    "finally and most importantly , the uncertainty in the co - to-   conversion factor @xmath25  does not directly affect the concentration factor .",
    "if @xmath25  is constant in each galaxy , then the constant value can be different from one galaxy to another without affecting @xmath39 , because the @xmath25  in  and  cancels out .",
    "this is true in a more general case where @xmath25  varies with radius but in the same manner , i.e. , @xmath41 with @xmath42 being similar in galaxies . in this case",
    ", @xmath39  correctly indicates the degree of gas concentration even if the multiplier @xmath43 is different among galaxies .",
    "a probable cause for the variation of @xmath42 among galaxies is the metallicity@xmath25  correlation ( wilson 1995 ; arimoto  1996 ) combined wit the different metallicity gradients in barred and unbarred galaxies ( see  1 ) . in barred galaxies , the shallower metallicity gradients tend to decrease @xmath39  than in unbarred systems .",
    "this possible bias , however , is opposite to what we observed ( see below ) , and thus does not weaken our conclusion .",
    "figure [ f.fcon ] plots the central and disk - averaged surface densities of molecular gas and the gas concentration factors with different symbols for barred and unbarred galaxies .",
    "it clearly shows the higher degree of gas concentration in barred galaxies than in unbarred galaxies ; the concentration factor @xmath39  is on average four times higher in barred systems .",
    "the kolmogorov - smirnov test shows that the difference in @xmath39   between barred and unbarred systems is statistically significant ; the probability for the null hypothesis of no difference between the two classes is only @xmath44 .",
    "[ f.fcon ]     the concentration factor may be biased by metallicity , as we mentioned , and may tend to be smaller in barred galaxies than unbarred systems for the same gas distribution .",
    "the correction for this would only _ increase _ the difference in @xmath39  between barred and unbarred galaxies",
    "[ f.r25-fcon ] plots @xmath39  versus @xmath35 .",
    "the barred galaxies in our sample have , on average , larger sizes than unbarred galaxies .",
    "larger galaxies have lower  and higher @xmath39  for the same total amount of gas .",
    "one might think for this reason that the higher @xmath39  in the barred systems in our sample is due to their larger sizes . however , since larger galaxies tend to have larger amount of gas ( in our sample and in general ) , the bias in @xmath39  due to galaxy size is small . in any case , the higher @xmath39  in barred than unbarred systems is still observed when we set the mean @xmath35 of the two classes same by dropping four largest and four smallest galaxies .",
    "figure [ f.mtot-mcen ] compares the total mass of molecular gas in each galaxy with the mass of molecular gas in the central kpc .",
    "the ratio of the two masses is another index of gas concentration , though it is more susceptible to galaxy size if larger galaxies have larger total gas mass ( i.e. ,  is roughly constant , for the same far - ir luminosity ; see casoli  1998 ) .",
    "the figure shows that for the same total mass of molecular gas , the gas masses in the central kpc are higher in barred galaxies than in unbarred galaxies , being consistent with our finding in fig .",
    "[ f.fcon ] .",
    "we conclude therefore that _ molecular gas is more concentrated to the central kpc in barred galaxies than in unbarred galaxies_.     fig .",
    "[ f.r25-fcon ]      fig .",
    "[ f.mtot-mcen ]       the higher gas concentration in barred galaxies strongly supports the bar - driven transport of gas to galactic centers . the result is the first one that is based on observations of molecular gas , obtained from a sample of galaxies , and passed a statistical test .",
    "it is therefore complementary to the existing pieces of observational evidence for the bar - driven gas transport . in particular",
    ", our result supports the conjecture that the higher sfrs in barred nuclei is due to larger amount of star forming material there .",
    "our sample is mostly in sbc or earlier types and thus our result could explain the higher sfrs in the nuclei of barred early - type spirals .",
    "the four - fold increase ( on average ) of the @xmath39   in barred galaxies provides an important clue on the amount of gas transported to the galactic centers . to increase @xmath39  by a factor of four in a galaxy , three times more gas than previously in the central kpc",
    "must be funneled there .",
    "one might think that barred galaxies originally had larger amount of gas in their centers .",
    "however , this seems less likely than the gas transport after galaxy formation , because some barred galaxies must have been formed from unbarred galaxies by tidal interactions .",
    "thus it is most likely that _ more than half of molecular gas within the central kpc of barred galaxies was transported there from outside by bars_. if the higher @xmath39  is solely due to the bar - driven gas transport then the amount of transported gas should be more than @xmath31 , excluding the gas that has been already consumed .",
    "finally we note on the distinction between barred and unbarred galaxies .",
    "we called sb and sab galaxies in rc3 as barred and sa galaxies as unbarred .",
    "the sb and sab classes are combined because we have only one sb galaxy ( ngc 1530 ) . in reality , the barred and unbarred classes are continuous rather than discrete .",
    "it is usual to find a weak bar or oval distortion in almost every disk galaxy when the galaxy is observed in red or near - ir light ( e.g. , @xcite ) . indeed",
    ", there are a few sa galaxies in our sample , e.g. , ngc 4254 and 4736 , that exhibit gas distributions probably caused by minor bars ( paper i ) . on the other hand ,",
    "some barred galaxies , e.g. , ngc 5248 and 6946 , may be regarded as unbarred galaxies with a pair of open spiral arms that mimics a bar ( paper i ; @xcite ) .",
    "the morphological classification in rc3 is based on optical imagery of galaxies .",
    "bars in our conclusion thus refer to the elongated structures recognizable ( for those who classified the galaxies ) in optical photographic images .",
    "such bars must cause larger distortions in gravitational potential than small bars and weak oval distortions missed in the classification .",
    "even if a bar really is made of open spiral arms , the elongated mass distribution causes the oval distortion in gravitational potential needed to transport gas .",
    "therefore our result obtained using the optical classification is in accord with a reasonable conjecture that galaxies with stronger oval distortions have larger power to transport gas to their centers .",
    "the higher concentration of molecular gas in barred galaxies not only demonstrates the power of stellar bars to fuel galactic centers but also constrains the relation between the supply and consumption of star forming gas in the central regions",
    ". the total amount of gas transported so far to the central kpc of barred galaxies must be larger than the total amount of gas consumed there mainly by star formation , because otherwise we would not see the higher @xmath39  in the barred nuclei .",
    "dividing the above amounts of gas and stars by the age of the bar in each galaxy one obtains a constraint that the time - averaged rate of gas inflow must be larger than the time - averaged sfr in the central kpc , i.e. , @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the inflow rate of gas to the central kpc and the angle brackets denote an average over the age of the bar .",
    "the ages of bars are likely different among galaxies in our sample .",
    "therefore the above relation probably hold in a broad range of time ( if not always ) in the lifetime of a bar . the constraint ( [ eq.sfr ] ) also gives a crude estimate of the time - averaged rate of gas inflow if one substitutes the time - averaged sfr with an ensemble average of current sfrs .",

    "even the smallest value of /  = 0.15 is larger than the apparent boundary of @xmath60 between hii and agn classes , being consistent with the hii type of ic 342 .",
    "thus it would just strengthen our observation if ic 342 could be plotted in fig .",
    "[ f.q - type ] .",
    "] , judging from the kolmogorov - smirnov test ( the probability for no difference is @xmath61 ) . the larger gas - to - dynamical mass ratios ( and hence smaller @xmath62 values [ see below ] ) in non - agn galaxies than in galaxies with active nuclei have also been noticed by vila - vilalo  ( 1999 ) and kohno  ( 1999 ) .",
    "a straightforward interpretation for this is that galaxies with larger amounts of gas for their sizes have more active star formation , resulting in nuclear spectra dominated by hii regions .",
    "a simple assessment of the stability of the nuclear gas disk supports this idea .",
    "if a uniform gas disk with a surface density @xmath63 has a rotational velocity @xmath64 at a radius @xmath65 , its gas - to - dynamical mass ratio within @xmath65 is @xmath66 .",
    "the stability parameter @xmath62 of the same disk ( @xcite ; @xcite ) is @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are epicycle frequency and gas velocity dispersion , respectively .",
    "we have used the fact that the rotation curves are steeply rising in the nuclear regions ( paper i ) and hence the epicyclic frequency @xmath68 is @xmath70 .",
    "the two parameters have a relation @xmath71 thus the gas - to - dynamical mass ratio is closely related to the @xmath62 parameter .",
    "numerically , @xmath62 is unity for typical values of @xmath72   and @xmath73  when @xmath74 is 0.1 .",
    "the gas disk is unstable when @xmath62 is below unity , and the disk instability likely results in cloud formation and subsequent star formation .",
    "therefore it is not surprising that hii nuclei appear predominantly above the line of @xmath75 .",
    "the average h@xmath76 luminosity of the hii nuclei is larger than that of the active nuclei ( see table [ t.average ] ) , though the sample is very small .",
    "therefore it is possible that emission from a dwarf agn , which may exist in most spiral galaxies , is overwhelmed by the emission from nuclear hii regions when the nuclear gas disk is unstable , resulting in the hii spectral classification for the galaxy .",
    "such hidden agn in hii nuclei have been inferred from models of diagnostic line ratios with more than one type of ionizing source , and from optical spectroscopy at high - spatial resolutions ( e.g. , kennicutt , keel , & blaha 1989 ) .",
    "similar situations may be prevalent .    ",
    "table [ t.average ]     there are of course caveats for the above argument on disk stability , and there exist other possible causes that could explain the lack of correlation between the central gas mass and agn .",
    "the errors in the @xmath62 values include the uncertainty of @xmath25  and likely internal structure in the co cores .",
    "the alternative causes for the apparent independence of gas mass and agn include the difficulty of delivering gas from @xmath56 pc to the central accretion disk , the small ( @xmath77 pc ) central holes of gas that are inferred in several galaxies ( paper i ) , and the higher chance of obscuration for the agns in gas - rich nuclei .",
    "probably all of these , including the effect of disk stability , contribute to the relation between the central gas mass and the appearance of emission line spectrum .",
    "theoretically it is predicted that the bar - driven transport of significant amount of gas to the center of a galaxy eventually destroys the bar ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the critical mass for the bar dissolution has been estimated to be about 5 % of the total mass of disk and bulge for the model of norman , selwood , & hasan ( 1996 ) .",
    "for the galaxy , which is comparable to our @xmath3 sample , the total mass of disk and bulge is about @xmath78  ( @xcite ) , and the critical mass is a few @xmath2 .",
    "the timescale for the bar dissolution is very short , being comparable to the dynamical timescale of the bar or a few @xmath4 yr ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , as noted by norman  ( 1996 ) , there are many parameters involved in the bar dissolution , and they may well change the critical mass and the dissolution timescale .",
    "for example , the following parameters have not been fully explored ; the shape of the bar , that of the disk , and the spatial distribution of funneled gas in the central regions ( some simulations use a central point source with a variable mass instead of a gas condensation with finite extent ) . in a different model ,",
    "a bar was destroyed by a smaller amount of mass concentration , 0.5 % of the disk mass or a few @xmath4  for the galaxy , at a longer timescale of a few @xmath2 yr ( @xcite ) .",
    "berentzen  ( 1998 ) also obtained a longer timescale for bar dissolution , @xmath79 yr or @xmath80 rotations , in their ( stars + gas in a halo ) model of a galaxy .",
    "our observations can constrain the timescale as well as the critical mass of the bar dissolution . first , our sample galaxies are among galaxies with largest amount of molecular gas in their inner regions ( @xmath81 kpc ) and hence their gas masses in the galactic centers , @xmath82 ",
    "@xmath2 , are probably among the largest in ordinary spiral galaxies .",
    "thus if these gas condensations ( plus the amount of stars formed from the gas ) are not enough to destroy bars , then the bar - dissolution would be rare in galaxies of similar scales ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "second , if a bar can be destroyed by a gas condensation of @xmath31 ",
    "@xmath2 , then the different degree of gas concentration between barred and unbarred galaxies constrains the lifetime of the bars .",
    "it is because the bars responsible for the higher gas concentrations must be alive until a large part of the funneled gas is consumed ; otherwise we would frequently observe currently unbarred ( but previously barred ) galaxies with high degree of gas concentration due to the destroyed bars .",
    "this argument leads to a constraint on timescales for bar dissolution and gas consumption , @xmath84 the gas consumption time may be evaluated using the current sfr and the current mass of molecular gas in the central region .",
    "@xmath85 the inequality is due to the ignored return of gas from stars and the supply of gas by a bar , though the latter might be small in old barred galaxies because of the limited supply of gas from the outer regions . at the current sfr of 0.1  1  the consumption times of the central gas condensations of @xmath31 ",
    "@xmath2 are larger than @xmath4 ",
    "@xmath5 yr . the smallest value does not contradict with the shortest timescale predicted by simulations . on the other hand , if larger values are the case in many spiral galaxies , then the bar dissolution would take longer time than predicted or would not be caused by a gas concentration of @xmath31  @xmath2 .",
    "the latter case does not contradict with the critical mass estimated by norman  ( 1996 ) , but makes the bar dissolution in @xmath6 galaxies a rare phenomenon caused only by exceptionally large transport of gas .    the above argument on the timescales for bar dissolution and",
    "gas consumption is an exploratory one , and may involve considerable errors for individual galaxies because , for example , the gas consumption may be much faster owing to episodic starbursts .",
    "however , statistical analysis of this kind is one of a few ways to observationally constrain the evolution of bars , and thus worthwhile to pursue .",
    "also , the measurement of the gas concentration is a way to find out galaxies with young bars and galaxies whose bars have been recently destroyed .",
    "the former would have low @xmath39  for barred galaxies , while the latter would have high @xmath39  ( @xmath86 ) for unbarred galaxies .",
    "there probably are galaxies with young bars in interacting systems ( @xcite ) .",
    "the galaxies in which bars have recently been destroyed would be most interesting to discover in order to elucidate the conditions and mechanisms for bar dissolution .",
    "from our co(10 ) imaging survey of the central regions of 20 nearby spiral galaxies , we find :    \\1 .",
    "strong peaks of co emission , with radial scale lengths @xmath87 pc and co - derived masses @xmath31@xmath2  in the central kpc , are prevalent in the nuclei of gas - rich @xmath3 spiral galaxies .",
    "these central gas condensations constitute about 10% of the dynamical masses in the central kpc .",
    "molecular gas is more concentrated to the central kpc in barred galaxies than in unbarred systems .",
    "this strongly supports the theory of bar - driven gas transport to galactic centers .",
    "more than half of molecular gas within the central kpc of barred galaxies was transported there from outside by bars .",
    "the higher gas concentration in barred galaxies suggests that the statistically higher sfrs in barred nuclei are due to abundant star - forming material there , and that star formation in the nuclear regions has not been able to catch up with the supply of gas by bars . a lower limit to the time - averaged rate of mass inflow to the central kpc is 0.1  1 .",
    "no correlation is found between nuclear activity ( agn ) and the mass of molecular gas within 500 pc of the nucleus .",
    "the similar incidence of agn between barred and unbarred galaxies is thus not due to the problem of bars to transport gas to the central kpc but must be due to the difficulties in gas fueling within the central kpc and in detecting the dwarf agn .",
    "the gas - to - dynamical mass ratio in the central kpc is higher in galaxies with hii spectral classification than in galaxies having an agn , with the dividing line at @xmath75 .",
    "it may well be related to the stability of the nuclear molecular gas disk , which is lower when @xmath88 is high . in hii galaxies , star formation triggered by",
    "the instability may be overwhelming dwarf active nuclei .",
    "the different degrees of gas concentration in barred and unbarred galaxies would not have been observed if gas condensations of @xmath4  @xmath2  in the central kpc could destroy bars on a timescale shorter than the gas consumption times .",
    "the gas consumption time , or a lower limit to the bar dissolution timescale , is in the range of @xmath4  @xmath5 yr .",
    "the lowest value does not contradict models of bar dissolution while the highest value implies that bar dissolution is not caused by the @xmath4 ",
    "@xmath2  gas condensations in @xmath3 galaxies .",
    "measurement of gas concentration in more galaxies would provide an observational test on the bar dissolution scenario .",

    "<S> this trend may well be related to the gravitational stability of the nuclear gas disk , which is generally lower for larger gas mass fractions . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore possible that all galaxies have active nuclei , but that dwarf agn are overwhelmed by the surrounding star formation when the nuclear molecular gas disk is massive and unstable .    </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical prediction of bar - dissolution by condensation of gas to galactic centers is observationally tested by comparing gas concentration in barred and unbarred galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> if a bar is to be destroyed so abruptly that the gas condensation at the nucleus does not have enough time to be consumed , then there would be currently unbarred but previously barred galaxies with high gas concentrations . </S>",
    "<S> the lack of such galaxies in our sample , together with the current rates of gas consumption at the galactic centers , suggests that the timescale for bar dissolution is larger than @xmath4  </S>",
