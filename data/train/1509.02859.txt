    "the scheme of quantum teleportation @xcite is of the essence for technological applications of quantum information processing such as quantum cryptography in multipartite quantum networks @xcite and for measurement based quantum computation @xcite . in the original teleportation scheme , an unknown qubit from a sender ( alice ) can be deterministically teleported to a receiver ( bob ) by performing bell - state measurement ( bsm ) through a bipartite entangled state ( called a channel ) in discrete variables ( dvs ) . after the feed - forward of classical information",
    ", one can recover the original qubit state at the other location of the channel .",
    "since the scheme of postselected dv teleportation has been firstly demonstrated in quantum optics @xcite , teleportation schemes have also been demonstrated in other physical systems , particularly for deterministic methods in ion traps @xcite , atomic ensembles @xcite and superconducting circuits @xcite .",
    "an alternative representation , called continuous - variable ( cv ) quantum teleportation @xcite , has been in parallel investigated because a cv channel is indeed a natural resource for entanglement ( e.g. , a position - momentum entangled state in the einstein - podolsky - rosen s paper @xcite ) .",
    "for example , the first demonstration of unconditional teleportation has been successfully performed in nonclassical cv states ( e.g. , using two - mode squeezed states ) @xcite .",
    "cv teleportation is essential to the schemes of cv quantum information processing which have shown advantages as compared with dv - qubit information processing @xcite ( e.g. , time - frequency encoding @xcite , fault - tolerant cv quantum computing @xcite ) .",
    "one of the cv - qubit representations is based on schrdinger cat states ( scs ) @xcite given by the superposition of two phase - opposite coherent states @xcite .",
    "the scss have been created in various methods ( e.g. , photon adding and subtracting schemes in quantum optics @xcite and ion- or rydberg atom - cavity systems @xcite ) and relatively larger scss have been very recently achieved in circuit - qed @xcite .",
    "a cv qubit can in principle encode information beyond dv qubits because it is described in infinite dimension @xcite .",
    "for example , a generalized scs with many different phases can be used to realise a qu@xmath0it which will be of use for hardware - efficient quantum memory @xcite .",
    "thus , dv - cv hybrid teleportation is not only an alternative for dv - qubit teleportation but also advantageous for practical quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "for instance , these recent developments will lead innovative tools for measurement - based quantum computing using hybrid single- and two - qubit gates @xcite .    here",
    "we develop a dv - cv hybrid teleportation scheme specifically designed to be implemented on a superconducting circuit .",
    "it is a key building block required for measurement - based quantum computation@xcite because a series of teleportations can mimick one- and two - qubit gates .",
    "the scheme is physically hybrid in the sense that it teleports quantum information from a solid - state qubit to a microwave photon .",
    "an unknown qubit is prepared in a two - level superconducting qubit and an entangled coherent states ( ecs ) , known as an excellent resource for quantum metrology and other quantum information processing @xcite , is created in microwave photons inside two cavities with the help of an adjacent superconducting qubit @xcite .",
    "this architecture is feasible in the state - of - the - art superconducting setup used for creating a microwave scs as shown recently in @xcite .",
    "it consists of two cavities coupled to three superconducting qubits and additional two readout resonators .",
    "the unknown state is encoded in a superconducting dv qubit and teleported into a cv state in one of the cavities .",
    "in contrast to dv- and cv - only teleportations , we find that the teleportation fidelity depends not only on the amount of decoherence but also on the amplitude size of the ecs channel state .",
    "the hybrid scheme discussed here has twofold meaning : hybrid qubits imply the combination of dv and cv encoding on one hand and of hybrid quantum systems in microwave and superconducting states on the other hand .",
    "the creation of entanglement in photonic hybrid qubits has been very recently demonstrated in quantum optics @xcite and optical hybrid cv teleportation has been very recently performed @xcite , however , two - fold hybrid cv quantum information processing has not been well developed yet because it is difficult to create the entangled states deterministically created by non - linear optical amplifiers with a low efficiency probabilistically .",
    "thus , the microwave ecs with high fidelity in cavities , which can be naturally entangled with superconducting qubits , will enable to be utilised for hybrid quantum information processing practically as we investigate the verification of ecss , single - qubit gates on ecss , and reduction of self - kerr effects in a cavity in sections [ iii ] and [ self - kerr ] .",

    "if the channel suffers decoherence before the bsm , it should be described in mixed states .",
    "based on the criteria of successful quantum teleportation in dv qubits , the average fidelity of a teleported state needs in theory to be higher than 2/3 to claim the validity of using a quantum channel because maximally correlated classical states ( i.e. , @xmath81 ) can be used for performing classical teleportation upto the average fidelity 2/3 @xcite .",

    "this issue might be originally caused by the definition of quantumness and nonclassicality .",
    "in our quantum teleportation , the quantity of the fidelity relies on the degree of decoherence as well as the nonorthogonality given by the initial size of @xmath66 of the channel state . for comparison with the fidelity of hybrid quantum teleportation",

    "for example , we compare the fidelity of hybrid teleportation with that of classical teleportation in the outcome of @xmath89 and explain which experimental condition would show a clear distinction between quantum and classical cases .    because the initial state is in dvs and the teleported state is in cv in our teleportation , we define the teleportation fidelity between a teleported state @xmath90 and an expected cv state @xmath91 given by @xmath92 where @xmath93 .",

    "in contrast to dv- and cv - only teleportations , the fidelities decrease not only with the decoherence of the ecs channel but also with the size of @xmath66 in the coherent - state representation . for example , for small @xmath66 , @xmath39 tends to behave similar to two vacuum states but still maintains the superposition between @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",

    ", the value of @xmath84 becomes 1/2 at around @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "the reason of @xmath113 for large @xmath66 with @xmath114 is that the classical teleportation also works well if the unknown state is in @xmath38 or @xmath60 as a classical bit . in the bottom of fig .",
    "[ fig : mixture_fidelity01 ] , if @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath87 both become a vacuum and two fidelities reaches 1 .",
    "interestingly , for @xmath114 ( or @xmath117 ) and @xmath118 , the hybrid teleportation fidelity is far less than 1 because of the effect of the nonorthogonal measurement in @xmath58 .",
    "however , the fidelity of hybrid quantum teleportation is always the unity ( @xmath119 ) for @xmath75 and any size of @xmath66 because the measurement outcomes of @xmath94 and @xmath120 bring the identical outcome as @xmath121 .",
    "thus , the issue of nonorthogonal measurement given by small @xmath66 does not affect on the fidelity at @xmath122 .",

    "[ fig : self - kerr01 ] shows that the effective self - kerr effect in a cavity alters with respect to the external flux through a fluxonium . for realistic parameters",
    ", we set up the cavity frequency as @xmath172 ghz and the transmon energy levels @xmath173 and coupling strengths @xmath174 are given by @xmath175 ghz and @xmath176 ghz ( see details in ref .",
    "@xcite ) while the fluxonium parameters are @xmath177 ghz , @xmath178 ghz and @xmath179 ghz @xcite . for example",
    ", we obtain @xmath180 khz in a system of a transmon and a cavity with the absence of a fluxonium ( @xmath181 ) while @xmath182 khz is given by the system of a fluxonium and cavity with @xmath183 .",
    "if we include both superconducting qubits with the cavity commonly connected , the self - kerr effect @xmath169 can be reduced .",
    "for example , if @xmath184 , @xmath185 ghz , @xmath186 ghz , and @xmath187 ghz @xcite while @xmath188 ghz , @xmath189 ghz , and @xmath190 .",
    "then , the self - kerr effect reduces @xmath191 khz ( from @xmath192 khz in the system of a transmon and a cavity ) .",
    "therefore , the architecture of the fluxonium - cavity - transmon can tune the self - kerr effect in a cavity by design in circuit - qed systems .",
    "we propose a teleportation scheme from a superconducting dv qubit to a microwave cv qubit in superconducting circuits .",
    "the proposed architecture of two cavities and three superconducting qubits is currently feasible with realistic parameters in the state - of - the - art platform of circuit - qed .",
    "the unknown state in a superconducting qubit is teleported via the ecs created between two cavities .",
    "the hybrid bell measurement encodes the quantum information in the unknown qubit into a continuous - variable qubit in a cavity state .",
    "the teleportation fidelity in the hybrid scheme can confirm that the ecs channel is a nonclassical resource with respect to the size of @xmath66 .",
    "the same architecture is also beneficial for other cv quantum information processing for the schemes of verification and error - correction in the ecs channel .",
    "finally , we presented a method of reducing a self - kerr distortion in a cavity induced by two different superconducting qubits .    toward hybrid measurement - based quantum computing in circuit - qed ,",
    "the capability of building a two cv - qubit gate between two cavities might be of essence in addition to single - qubit gates in superconducting circuits @xcite .",
    "for example , linear four - qubit hybrid cluster states will give a strength of one- and two - qubit gates which has been investigated in photonic measurement - based quantum computation @xcite . to overcome errors in both superconducting and cavity qubits , we may need to build logical hybrid qubits with logical cluster states or to entangle higher - dimensional cv - qudits with superconducting qubits @xcite . for creating multi - partite ecss ,",
    "cross - kerr interaction could be used in the multiple - cavity architecture joined by mediating qubits in order to keep the capability of cv - qubit operations in a dispersive regime .",
    "furthermore , a full simulation of creating an ecs and of performing the hybrid quantum information processing in the 2c3q architecture will be presented in later work @xcite .",
