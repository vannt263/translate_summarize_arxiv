    "for those few scientists who win nobel prizes or turing awards , their standing in their research community is unquestionable . for the rest of us , it is more complex to understand where we stand and who we are alike .",
    "we study this problem and aim to help researchers understand themselves by comparisons with others .",
    "it is human nature to try to compare people .",
    "movie stars , ceos , authors , and singers , are all compared on a number of dimensions .",
    "it is common to hear a new artist being introduced in terms of other artists that they are similar to or have been influenced by . in research , it is also common to look for comparable people .",
    "recommendation letters and tenure cases often suggest other researchers who are comparable to the individual in question . in discussing whether someone is suitable to collaborate with , we might ask who they are similar to in their research work .",
    "these comparisons can have significant influence by indicating that researchers compare favorably to others , and by providing a starting point for detailed discussions of the individual s strengths and weaknesses .    yet finding the right researcher to compare against",
    "is a challenging task .",
    "there is no simple strategy that allows a similar researcher to be found .",
    "natural first attempts , such as looking at co - authors , or scouring the author s preferred publication venues ( conferences or journals ) , either fail to find good candidates , or swamp us with too many possibilities . in this paper",
    ", we are particularly interested in comparing any pair of two researchers given their research output , as embodied by their publications over years .",
    "there are several challenges to address here .",
    "firstly , we need suitable data and metrics .",
    "the comparison may be based on the research impact , teaching performance , funding raised or students advised . for some of these , we lack the data to support automatic comparison . moreover , research interests and output levels of a researcher change over time , and we may wish to focus on periods of greatest activity or influence .",
    "the whole career of a researcher may last several decades . during this career ,",
    "she / he may be productive all the time , may take time off for a while , or switch topics .",
    "it can be difficult to find a perfect match for the whole career .",
    "there are limited number existing metrics to evaluate research impact at the individual level .",
    "examples include h - index  @xcite and g - index  @xcite .",
    "these metrics are mainly based on raw citation counts , i.e. , the number of papers citing a given paper , which have several limitations .",
    "firstly , garfield  @xcite argued that citation counts are a function of many influencing factors besides scientific quality , such as area of research , number of co - authors the language used in the paper and various other factors .",
    "secondly , in many cases few if any citations are recorded , even though the paper s influence may go beyond this crude measure of impact  @xcite .",
    "thirdly , citation counts evolve over time .",
    "papers published longer ago are more likely to have higher counts than those released more recently .",
    "* our approach .",
    "* focusing on the computer science domain , we propose an approach to compare researchers that utilizes the quality of venues of publication . in this paper , we focus on conferences , since researchers in computer science often prefer conference publications , and the data available on the web is also skewed to conferences .",
    "other disciplines may favor journals instead ; our methods apply equally to such settings .",
    "while citation behavior varies across sub - fields , we can treat the quality rank of venues as a way to level the comparison across sub - fields .",
    "we associate a paper with the quality rank of its publishing venue . instead of averaging over the quality rank , which might be unreliable in comparison",
    ", we consider the sequence of venue qualities over the full career of a researcher .",
    "our key intuition is that the career trajectory of a researcher can be represented as a series of their publications .",
    "we use the quality of the venue as a surrogate for the quality of the paper .",
    "consequently we can compare two researchers by matching their career trajectories , as sequences of venue rankings .",
    "the distance between two researchers is calculated by allowing some mismatches , and counting the number of deletion and insertion operations necessary to harmonize the two sequences . besides the pattern on the quality of publishing venues",
    ", we also consider research topics to identify comparable researchers in the same or similar sub - fields .",
    "we thus propose a variant that incorporates topic similarity between authors . with simple modifications",
    "our methods can be used to match a junior author to the early career stages of a more senior researcher .",
    "this can be especially useful when trying to predict the trajectory of a researcher for years to come .",
    "* there are many online services that index research work . for computer science ,",
    "the dblp is a bibliography website that lists more than 2.3 million articles ; while arxiv.org   hosts hundreds of thousands of pre - prints from computer science and beyond . services such as google scholar , arnetminer , researchgate offer rich functionalities including search , information aggregation and navigation , and social networking . the availability of such data has led to its use for numerous other applications .",
    "for example , metrics such as h - index  @xcite to evaluate the impact of a researcher ; the network structure of scientists connected by co - authorship relation  @xcite ; community detection in citation networks  @xcite ; the study of how science is written  @xcite .",
    "other services provide rankings of publication venues , e.g. google scholar metrics , microsoft academic  and core . while coverage of venues is large we found there is considerable disagreement among sources in categorizing sub - fields , and many ranking results may appear surprising .",
    "how to rank topic - dependent venues objectively remains an interesting and open research problem . to simplify the process and focus on the comparison algorithms , we take advantage of an existing subject - dependent ranking that covers broadly known conferences .    *",
    "contributions and outline . * in this paper , we conduct exploratory analysis on large - scale scholarly data , which contain millions of researchers and publications .",
    "we extract useful information , and for the first time , we demonstrate how to compare researchers and detect comparable relations automatically .",
    "we also show there are many interesting open problems for future work .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : problemdef ] we define the problem setting , and show exploratory analysis on large scale datasets available on the web . in section  [ sec : criteria ] we discuss the evaluation by venue ranking for researchers , and the comparison between researchers by matching sequences of venue rankings .",
    "we show the effectiveness of our methods through case studies .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusion ] and show there are many interesting open problems for future work .",
    "let @xmath0 be the set of authors , @xmath1 be the set of papers , @xmath2 be the set of publishing venues .",
    "each paper @xmath3 is associated with a set of authors @xmath4 .",
    "the paper is published in a venue @xmath5 at the time @xmath6 .",
    "we assume that for each venue @xmath7 we have a score which corresponds to the rating of the venue , where higher score implies higher rank and quality . in database terms , our system contains three entity tables : author , paper , venue , and two relation tables : author - paper , paper - venue ( figure  [ schema ] ) .",
    "the problem we are interested in is , given the database of researchers and their publications , for any pair of researchers @xmath8 , to measure the extent to which they are comparable , under various notions of similiarity .",
    "our empirical analysis is based on two datasets available on the web : bibliographical information about computer science journals and proceedings from dblp , and a citation network dataset from arnetminer  @xcite .",
    "both datasets collect scholarly data up to january 2011 .",
    "the venue name in the arnetminer data is noisy , since the name of a conference can appear in multiple forms , for example , full phrases of conference name , abbreviations , and abbreviations plus volume numbers and so on .",
    "we found abbreviations of conference names are used consistently in dblp .",
    "thus we extract the abbreviation and combine other information to identify the venue for each paper .",
    "however , the data from arnetminer contains rich information including title , abstract and most importantly , year .",
    "we match data from both datasets by the paper name and author names , then create a corpus with the joint data .",
    "table  [ datasets ] lists the statistics of datasets , including the one we derived .",
    "we first analyze the data characteristics before using it to answer our questions .",
    ".dataset statistics [ cols=\"^,<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ case - study2 ]    given the topic distribution for each paper , we can compute the topic similarity via cosine similarity , or jensen - shannon divergence , etc .",
    "we use cosine similarity in our examples . with the new distance metric",
    ", the dynamic programming formula is modified to the following .",
    "@xmath9 we present some examples of researchers from different topics in our results in table  [ case - study2 ] . in general , we found results for each researcher are closer in research topics .",
    "see , for example , the output for `` dimitris n. metaxas '' in tables  [ case - study1 ] and  [ case - study2 ] . for `` judea pearl '' , both edit distance and topic edit distance return comparable authors in similar research topics . recall that the topic distribution of each author is learned mostly from their paper titles .",
    "we manually validated many examples , and compared the results by simply utilizing the topic similarity between authors and by our approach .",
    "we found that sequence matching combining topics from title and venue scores did a better job in finding authors in similar research area .",
    "taking `` richard m. karp '' for example , we find that 16 of the 20 comparable researchers returned also have entries in wikipedia , a crude indication that they are similarly notable .",
    "future work may more systematically examine the performance of clustering similar authors by our distance metric .",
    "there are a few notable bad examples : the comparable researchers for `` donald e. knuth '' are only loosely related .",
    "knuth s paper titles are often short , and commonly use generic computer science terms like `` algorithm '' .",
    "hence , topic inference on his papers has poor performance , and the comparable authors are mainly determined on venue score sequence matching .",
    "as our data contains only @xmath10 authors , many are missing ( along with their papers ) , limiting the set of potential comparable authors .      each year , many junior researchers begin their career .",
    "it is useful and interesting to matching junior researchers to segments of senior researchers . with simple modification",
    ", our algorithm can be used to compare a junior researcher to senior researchers in their early career stage .",
    "this can be useful , for example , to committees considering the future prospects of job candidates , and to junior researchers finding out whose career trajectory they are following .",
    "formally , we are interested in the problem that , given a senior researcher and a junior researcher characterized by @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively . instead of matching full sequence of @xmath11 and @xmath12 , we want to match @xmath12 to every prefix of @xmath11 .",
    "a prefix of the sequence @xmath11 with length @xmath13 is denoted by @xmath14 $ ] where @xmath15 .",
    "the final distance is then the minimal of matching distances with every prefix .",
    "if we store all intermediate steps of the dynamic programming table , we can easily compute the distance of prefix matching . specifically , the vector @xmath16 stores the minimal distance from every prefix of @xmath11 to @xmath12 , where @xmath17 is the length of @xmath12 .",
    "consequently the minimal distance is no longer @xmath18 but @xmath19 .",
    "we sample authors with fewer than 100 papers within less than 20 years of research period to test the prefix matching . for brevity",
    ", we omit examples . comparing to matching full sequence ,",
    "there are more senior researchers mixed in the results by prefix matching .",
    "in this paper , we address the novel problem of automatically finding comparable researchers through large scholarly data . unlike existing work , which evaluates researchers mainly by citation counts , our methods consider the sequence of the quality of publishing venues , which seems more appropriate for evaluating and comparing research output . to allow automatic identification of comparable people in similar research areas , we further propose a distance metric which combines the topic similarity and venue quality .",
    "our approach can be easily modified to match junior researches to senior researcher at their beginning of research periods .",
    "our analysis and experiment was conducted on large - scale scholarly datasets available on the web .",
    "the effectiveness of our methods are demonstrated by arbitrarily picked examples .",
    "there are several problems open for future study .",
    "* data collection : lack of data may lead to less accurate results .",
    "many challenges exist in the data collection , e.g. reducing the language gap , knowledge extraction from multiple data sources with different formats .",
    "* evaluation : there is currently no `` ground truth '' for our methods .",
    "we are developing a user interface to allow exploration of comparable people , and collect user feedback on results . *",
    "optimization : our methods compute the matching distance between each pair of researchers through their full publication records , a quadratic number of comparisons .",
    "a different approach is required to make this more scalable . *",
    "comparable network : with comparable relation established , we can define a comparable network , in which each node is a researcher , and edges connect comparable nodes .",
    "the weight on the edge is related to the distance between two nodes .",
    "it may be interesting to examine the structure of such network , and compare it with co - authorship and citation networks .",
