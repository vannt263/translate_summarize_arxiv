    "the centers of galaxies contain both massive black holes ( mbhs ) and nuclear star clusters ( nscs ) .",
    "the presence of mbhs has been dynamically measured in about 50 galaxies and it appears that most massive galaxies probably have a mbh ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "nuclear star clusters are compact ( @xmath6  pc ) , massive ( @xmath7  m@xmath3 ) star clusters found at the center of a majority of spirals and lower mass ellipticals @xcite . unlike normal star clusters",
    ", they have multiple stellar populations with a wide range of ages @xcite .",
    "nuclear star clusters coexist with mbhs in some galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , the nearby galaxies m33 and ngc  205 have nscs but no apparent central black hole @xcite , while some high mass core elliptical galaxies have mbhs but lack nscs @xcite .    occupation fractions and masses for mbhs in lower mass galaxies retain the imprint of the seed black holes ( bhs ) from which they form , information which has been lost due to subsequent accretion in higher mass galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". however , the presence and mass of mbhs in lower mass galaxies is very poorly constrained .",
    "most galaxies are too far away to measure the dynamical effect of a bh with mass @xmath810@xmath9  m@xmath3 ( often referred to as intermediate mass black holes ; imbhs ) with current instrumentation .",
    "thus the presence of imbhs in galaxy centers has only been inferred when agn activity is observed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these agn provide only a lower limit on the number of mbhs in lower mass galaxies , and the bh mass estimates from the agn are quite uncertain .",
    "dynamical measurements of mbhs in nearby massive galaxies have revealed that the mass of a galaxy s central mbh is correlated with its bulge mass @xcite .",
    "the scaling of bh mass with the large - scale properties of galaxies extends to many measurable quantities including the bulge velocity dispersion @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have presented evidence that nscs scale with bulge mass and dispersion in elliptical and early - type spiral galaxies in almost exactly the same way as mbhs .",
    "the similarity between the nsc and mbh scaling relationships led @xcite and @xcite to suggest that mbhs and nscs are two different types of central massive objects ( cmo ) both of which contain a small fraction ( @xmath10.2% ) of the total galaxy mass .",
    "this correlation of the cmo mass with the large scale properties of galaxies suggests a link between the formation of the two .",
    "however , the nature of this connection is unknown , as is the relation between nscs and mbhs .",
    "studies of nscs can help address these issues .",
    "their morphology , kinematics , and stellar populations contain important clues about their formation and the accretion of material into the center of galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "recent studies have shown that most liners do in fact appear to be agn , with a majority of them having detected x - ray cores @xcite , radio cores @xcite , and many of them possesing mid - ir coronal lines @xcite and uv variable cores @xcite .",

    "no radio core is observed down to a limiting flux of 1.3  mjy at 15  ghz with the vla in a array @xcite , however , @xcite do detect an unresolved 3  mjy continuum source at 1.4  ghz using the c array .",
    "a compact x - ray source is detected @xcite , but its low luminosity and soft thermal spectrum indicates that it could be the result of a starburst .",
    "signatures of o stars are seen in the uv spectrum of the nucleus , however dilution of these lines suggests that @xmath160% of the uv flux could result from a non - thermal source @xcite .",
    "this suggestion is supported by more recent uv observations which show that the uv emission is variable , declining by a factor of @xmath13 between 1993 and 2002 @xcite .",
    "hst observations of h@xmath28 show that the emission occurs primarily in a compact source 0.16  north of the nucleus and in wispy structures suggestive of supernova remnants @xcite .",
    "the [ ] emission has a double lobed structure along the galaxy major - axis @xcite , and has a higher velocity dispersion than h@xmath28 near the galaxy center @xcite .",
    "the mid - ir spectrum of ngc  404 shows evidence for high excitation consistent with other agn @xcite .",
    "in particular the ratio of the [ ] flux relative to other emission lines ( [ ] , [ ] ) is higher than any other liners in the @xcite sample and is similar to other known agn .",
    "however , [ nev ] lines , which are a more reliable indicator of agn activity @xcite , are not detected . in summary ,",
    "the case for an accreting mbh in ngc  404 remains ambiguous , with the variable uv emission providing the strongest evidence in favor of its existence .    in this paper",
    "we take a detailed look at the central arcseconds of ngc  404 and find evidence that it contains both a massive nuclear star cluster and a black hole . in  2 we describe the data used in this paper including adaptive optics gemini / nifs observations .",

    "7 we discuss these results , concluding in  8 .",
    "this paper presents a combination of a wide variety of data including : ( 1 ) high spatial resolution near - infrared ifu spectroscopy with gemini nifs , ( 2 ) optical long - slit spectra from the mmt , and ( 3 ) hst imaging data from the uv through the nir . using these data we have determined the morphology , gas and stellar kinematics , and stellar populations of the central regions of ngc404 . in this section",
    "we describe these data and their reduction .",
    "observations of ngc  404 with gemini s near - infrared integral field spectrometer ( nifs ) are part of an ongoing survey of nearby nuclear star clusters . the data were taken using the altair laser - guide star ( lgs ) system on the gemini north telescope on the nights of 21st and 22nd september , 2008 .",
    "the nucleus itself was used as a tip - tilt star .",
    "a total of twelve 760 second exposures were obtained ; half were dithered on - source exposures while the others were sky exposures offset by 131  to the northwest taken after each on - source exposure .",
    "a telluric calibrator , hip  1123 , an a1 star , was observed both nights at an airmass similar to the observations .",
    "the data were reduced using the gemini v. 1.9 iraf package , utilizing pipelines based on the nifsexamples scripts .",
    "ronchi mask and arc lamp images were used to determine the spatial and spectral geometry of the images .",
    "the sky images were subtracted from their neighboring on - source images , and then these images were flat - fielded , had bad pixels removed , and were split apart into long - slit slices .",
    "the spectra were then divided by the telluric calibrator ( using nftelluric ) after correcting for the br@xmath31 absorption in the calibrator .",
    "we made minor alterations to the gemini pipeline to enable propogation of the variance spectrum .",
    "this also required creation of our own idl version of the nifcube to make the final data cubes . in this process",
    "the initial pixel size of the data , 0.103  in the vertical direction and 0.045  in the horizontal direction , was rebinned to 0.05@xmath210.05  pixels in the final data cube for each on - source exposure .",
    "data cubes for the six dithered exposures were then shifted spatially and combined with cosmic - ray rejection using our own idl program .",
    "data from the 2nd night was spectrally shifted to the wavelength solution of the first night before combining .",
    "the heliocentric correction was nearly identical on both nights ( + 13.25 km@xmath26s@xmath27 ) .",
    "the nifs spectrum within a 1  aperture is shown in fig .",
    "[ optirfig ] and shows strong absorption and emission lines .",
    "we also processed the sky frames in a manner identical to the on - source exposures .",
    "we used the resulting data to calibrate the spectral resolution of our observations . using thirteen isolated , strong , doublet sky lines , we measured the spectral resolution of each pixel in our final data cube .",
    "we found significant variations in the spectral resolution across the detector , with a median resolution of 4.36  fwhm ( @xmath32 ) , and values ranging from 3.9 to 5.1  fwhm .",
    "a @xmath33-band image was made by collapsing all channels after multiplying by ( 1 ) a 9500k black - body to correct for the shape of the telluric spectrum , and ( 2 ) the 2mass response curve .",
    "flux calibration was obtained from 2mass by deriving a zeropoint from images of both sources and calibrators in our sample .",
    "we flux calibrated our spectra using synthetic 2mass photometry of our telluric calibrator hip  1123 , assuming its spectral shape resembles that of a 9500k black body . from this flux calibration we obtained a flux calibrated spectrum of our ngc404 nifs data cube with units of ergs@xmath26s@xmath34@xmath35@xmath27 .",
    "the flux calibration of the image and spectrum is good to @xmath110% .",
    "understanding the point spread function ( psf ) is important for interpreting the kinematic observations presented in  4 , and is even more critical for the dynamical modeling in  6 .",
    "we used two methods for measuring the psf of the calibrator : ( 1 ) we created images from the telluric calibrator for both nights to estimate the psf , and ( 2 ) we compared the final nifs @xmath33-band images of the ngc404 nucleus to hst f814w data .",
    "we initially tried modeling the psf as a double gaussian ( as in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , double gaussians were a very poor fit to the wings of the psf in the telluric calibrator images .",
    "using an inner gaussian @xmath36 outer moffat profile ( @xmath37^{4.765}$ ] ) adequately described the telluric calibrator psf .",
    "the best fit on both nights was a psf with an inner gaussian fwhm of @xmath38 , and an outer moffat profile @xmath39 of @xmath40 , each containing about half the light .",
    "the two nights psfs were very similar ( @xmath41% differences ) in both shape and fraction of light in each component .",
    "unfortunately , our telluric images were not well - dithered and thus the central psf is not well sampled .",
    "we further refined the psf by fitting a convolved version of the f814w band hst image to the nifs @xmath33-band image .",
    "although hst / nic2 and nic3 f160w data were also available , the larger pixel scale and the limited resolution of hst in the nir ( fwhm@xmath10.14 ) make the f814w data a better image to use as a psf reference . due to the dust around the nucleus ,",
    "we fit only the western , apparently dust - free , half of the nucleus ( fig .",
    "[ colorfig ] ) .",
    "also , we find in  3.1 that the nifs image contains compact non - stellar emission from hot dust at the center ; we therefore correct the @xmath33-band image for this dust correction before determination of the psf .",
    "finally , because the profile of the galaxy is much shallower than the psf , we fix the functional form of the outer profile to that derived for the telluric star , but allow the inner psf width and fraction of light in each component to vary .",
    "the best - fitting psf has a core with fwhm@xmath42 ( assuming an hst resolution of @xmath43 based on tinytim models ; @xcite ) containing 51% of the light , with the outer moffat ( with @xmath44 ) function containing 49% of the light .",
    "this psf suffers from a number of uncertainties .",
    "most notably , the presence of a bluer population at the center of the cluster implied by fig .  [ colorfig ] may make the f814w image more centrally concentrated relative to the dust - corrected @xmath33-band image .",
    "due to our fitting the nifs psf core to a convolution of the f814w image , this effect could lead to an over - estimate in the core fwhm .",
    "derivation of the stellar kinematics was done as described in @xcite with a couple of additions . in brief , we first spatially binned the data to a target signal - to - noise ( s / n ) of 25 using the voronoi tesselation method described in @xcite .",
    "the s / n of the data was as high as 175 in the center , and data within @xmath45 was left unbinned .",
    "next , we determined the stellar line - of - sight velocity distribution ( losvd ) using the penalized pixel - fitting of @xcite to derive the velocity , dispersion , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 components in the wavelength region from 22850  to 23900 .",
    "we used high - resolution templates from @xcite which has supergiant , giant and main sequence stars between spectral types g and m ; we used eight of these stars with the most complete wavelength coverage .",
    "these templates were convolved to the instrumental resolution measured in each pixel from the sky lines before fitting the losvd . nearly identical",
    "kinematic results and fit qualities were obtained using the larger gnirs library @xcite as templates .",
    "we performed losvd fits over different ranges of wavelengths and with different subsets of templates and achieved consistent results , suggesting template mismatch is not a significant issue . the higher spectral resolution and",
    "more accurate velocity zeropoints made the @xcite better than the @xcite templates for deriving the kinematics .",
    "errors on the losvd were calculated by taking the standard deviation of values derived from 100 monte carlo simulations in which appropriate levels of gaussian random noise was added to each spectral pixel before remeasuring the losvd .",
    "errors on the radial velocities ranged from 0.5 to 6  km@xmath26s@xmath27 depending primarily on the s / n .",
    "optical spectroscopy of the ngc  404 cluster was obtained ( along with spectra of other nearby nscs ) with the blue channel spectrograph ( bcs ) on the mmt 6.5 m telescope on the night of 19 jan 2009 .",
    "we used the 500 line grating and a 1 arcsecond slit to obtain a resolution of @xmath13.6  fwhm between 3680  and 6815  with a pixel size of @xmath48 spatially and 1.17  spectrally .",
    "two 1200s exposures were taken , with one being affected by clouds .",
    "due to variations in the slit width , flat - fielding of the data was accomplished by carefully constructing a composite flat field using the pattern from quartz flats taken just after the exposure with pixel - to - pixel information drawn from flats throughout the night .",
    "wavelength calibration was done using arcs taken just after the science exposures .",
    "spectral extraction was accomplished using the standard iraf doslit routine using optimal extraction over the central @xmath49 of the slit while sky regions were selected to avoid regions of emission near the nucleus .",
    "guide camera seeing was around @xmath50 , however within the instrument it appeared to be significantly larger ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "three flux calibrators , gliese  191b2b , hz44 , and vma2 @xcite were observed on the same night with the same observing set up .",
    "flux calibration was achieved by combining information from all three flux calibrators using sensfunc .",
    "final residuals between the fitted sensitivity function and the 3 calibrators were @xmath00.03 mags between 3680  and 6200 .",
    "we note that 2nd order contamination was present beyond 6200 .",
    "one of the ngc  404 exposures and 2/3 calibrator exposures were affected by clouds . however , by scaling to the clear exposures , the absolute calibration of the spectra appears to be quite good ; comparison of emission line fluxes to those in @xcite shows agreement to within 5% through a similar size aperture .",
    "the s / n per pixel of the final combined spectrum ranged from 100 at 3700  to 250 around 5000 .",
    "the extracted nuclear spectrum is shown in fig .",

    "a wide variety of hst data are available for the nucleus of ngc  404 taken with the fos , wfpc2 , nicmos and acs hrc and wfc . in this paper",
    "we will use wfpc2 data in the f547 m , f656n ( pid : 6871 ) , f555w , and f814w ( pid : 5999 ) filters , acs wfc data in f814w filter ( pid : 9293 ) and nicmos nic2 and nic3 data in the f160w filter ( pid : 7330 & 7919 ) .",
    "data were downloaded from the hst archive and the hubble legacy archive ( hla ) .",
    "the wfpc2 data all had the nucleus in the pc chip and were unsaturated , while the acs f814w data is saturated at the center but covers the galaxy to larger radii than the wfpc2 data .",
    "astrometric alignment of this data and the nifs data was tied to the f814w wfpc2 data .",
    "the centroided position of the nucleus was used to align each image to the f814w data .",
    "although dust clearly affects the area around the nucleus , the f547m - f814w color map ( fig .  [ colorfig ] ) and the alignment of sources in the nifs br@xmath31 map with the hst h@xmath28 image ( see  3.2 ) suggests that the very center of the galaxy does not suffer from significant internal dust extinction .",
    "to determine the extent and luminosity of the nuclear star cluster in ngc  404 , it is necessary to fit the relatively steep surface brightness profile of the inner part of the galaxy .",
    "using srsic fits to @xmath52 and @xmath53-band data , we find evidence that a nuclear star cluster dominates the central 1  ( 15  pc ) of the galaxy , and that an additional emission component appears to be present within the central few parsecs ( see fig .",

    "the extra - light components in elliptical galaxies are thought to result from gas funneled to the center of the galaxy during gas - rich mergers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "given the complicated kinematics and stellar population of the ngc  404 nsc , it must be formed from multiple episodes of nuclear accretion . however , it formed about half its stars 1 - 3  gyr ago . in @xcite",
    ", they suggest ngc  404 underwent a merger with a gas - rich dwarf @xmath11  gyr ago to explain the presence of the hi gas disk observed at large radii .",
    "the age estimate of the merger was based on the radius beyond which the gas had not yet settled onto the galaxy plane .",
    "it is therefore plausible that the @xmath226  m@xmath3 of stars formed at about this same age in the nsc resulted from accumulation of merger gas at the center of the galaxy .",
    "a merger origin is also consistent with the presence of counter - rotation in the central excess .",
    "this scenario is quite different from the formation mechanism suggested by observations of late - type galaxies @xcite , which appear to form primarily by episodic accretion of material ( gas or stars ) from the galaxy disk .",
    "resolved observations of a larger sample of nscs in early - type galaxies is required to determine if ngc  404 is an unusual case , or if nscs in early - type galaxies typically show some evidence gas accreted from mergers .",
    "our dynamical modeling in  6 provides mixed evidence for the presence of an mbh in ngc  404 with mass less than 10@xmath9  m@xmath3 ( making it an imbh candidate ) .",
    "if verified through follow - up observations , this bh would be the lowest mass dynamically detected bh at the center of a galaxy , with previous determinations of low mass bhs in m32 ( @xmath227  m@xmath3 ; * ? ? ? * ) and circinus ( @xmath228  m@xmath3 ; * ? ? ? * ) being significantly more massive . a reverberation mapping mass of the bh in nearby seyfert  1 galaxy ngc  4395 @xcite , and indirect mass measurements in other low mass seyfert  1 galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) provide additional evidence for the presence of imbhs at the centers of lower mass galaxies .",
    "possible imbhs at the center of star clusters ( and possible former nuclei ) g1 @xcite , @xmath229  cen @xcite , and m54 @xcite suggest that imbhs with masses of @xmath230  m@xmath3 may be widespread , but these results remain controversial . measuring the occupation fraction and mass of bhs in galaxies like ngc  404 is key to understanding the formation of mbhs in general @xcite .    from the latest version of the @xmath231 relations for different galaxy samples from @xcite ,",
    "the predicted @xmath232 ranges from @xmath233  m@xmath3 for a bulge @xmath181 of 35 - 40  km@xmath26s@xmath27 .",
    "this range of masses is consistent with all our dynamical bh mass estimates .",
    "a somewhat higher mass ( @xmath234  m@xmath3 ) is implied by the @xcite relationship ( see fig .  [ scalingfig ] ) and is consistent only with the gas - dynamical estimate , while the @xcite relationships have masses @xmath235  m@xmath3 and are thus inconsistent with our data .",
    "if a black hole with a few @xmath236  m@xmath3 resides in the center of ngc  404 , better knowledge of the mass model from future hst observations should enable us to detect it .",
    "the relative mass of nscs and bhs within a single galaxy can probe the relationship of these two objects .",
    "@xcite find that the relative mass of bhs and nscs is of order unity ( with a scatter of at least one order of magnitude ) , while @xcite suggest a possible evolution in the relative mass with the least massive galaxies being nsc dominated , and the most massive galaxies being bh dominated .",
    "the bh in ngc  404 is @xmath010% of the nsc mass and thus is not an obvious outlier from other galaxies where the mass of both objects is known .",
    "finally , we note that the evidence of variability in the uv spectrum @xcite and possibly the nir dust emission (  3.1 ) , suggests that the ngc  404 black hole accretion is variable . in both cases ,",
    "the observed flux decreased from observations taken in the 1990s to those taken in the last decade .",
    "this might help explain the ambiguous nature of the agn indicators in the ngc  404 nucleus ; emission that originates near the bh ( e.g. hard x - ray emission , broad h@xmath28 ) may have recently disappeared , while the narrow - line region located at tens of parsecs , may continue to show signs of the earlier accretion .",
    "however , the observed hot dust emission suggests that the bh may still be accreting at a very low level .",
    "this paper is the second resulting from our survey of nearby nuclear star clusters , and demonstrates the rich detail we can obtain for these objects .",
    "the ngc  404 nucleus is a complicated environment , with both a nuclear star cluster and a possible black hole .",
    "we have found that the surface brightness profile of the inner part of ngc  404 suggests the galaxy can be broken into three components : ( 1 ) a bulge that dominates the light beyond 1 , with @xmath237  m@xmath3 , @xmath238  pc , and a srsic index of @xmath12.5 , ( 2 ) a nsc that dominates the light in the central arcsecond with @xmath239  pc and a dynamical mass of @xmath240  m@xmath3 , and ( 3 ) a central excess at @xmath72 , composed of younger stars , dust emission , and perhaps agn continuum .",
    "nifs ifu spectroscopy shows that the nsc has modest rotation along roughly the same axis as the hi gas at larger radii , while the central excess counter - rotates relative to the nsc .",
    "furthermore , molecular gas traced by h@xmath107 emission shows rotation perpendicular to the stellar rotation .",
    "a stellar population analysis of optical spectra indicate that half of the stars in the nsc formed @xmath11  gyr ago .",
    "some ancient and very young ( @xmath010  myr ) stars are also present .",
    "this star formation history is dramatically different from the rest of ngc  404 , which is dominated by stellar populations @xmath1225  gyr in age .",
    "we suggest a possible scenario where the burst of star formation in the nsc @xmath11  gyr ago resulted from the accretion of gas into the galaxy center during a merger .",
    "this formation scenario is quite different from the episodic disk accretion suggested by observations nscs in late - type galaxies .",
    "our dynamical modeling of the stellar and gas kinematics provide mixed evidence for the presence of a black hole in ngc  404 . assuming a constant @xmath140 within the nucleus",
    ", the stellar dynamical model suggests an upper limit of @xmath241  m@xmath3 , as well as measuring a @xmath176 for the nsc .",
    "the gas kinematics are best fit by models including the presence of a black hole with @xmath222 m@xmath3 .",
    "both dynamical bh mass estimates rely on a model for the stellar mass that we construct from hst @xmath186-band imaging .",
    "uncertainties in the light profile ( due to variability ) and @xmath140 ( due to stellar population changes ) within the central excess are of the same order as the difference between the two black hole mass estimates .",
    "we have proposed to measure the mass model by using hst / stis spectroscopy to resolve the stellar populations within the nucleus and additional multi - band imaging to extend this model to two dimensions .",
    "if successful we will combine this mass model with the kinematic observations presented here as well as larger - scale kinematics obtained from the mmt to more robustly determine the bh mass .",
    "in addition to the direct evidence of the bh from the dynamical models , we find two other properties of the nucleus which suggest the presence of an agn .",
    "first , we find unresolved hot dust emission at the center of the nsc with a luminosity of @xmath242  ergs@xmath26s@xmath27 .",
    "comparison of the nifs light profile to previous nicmos observations suggests that this dust emission may be variable as is seen in other agn .",
    "second , the h@xmath107 line ratios within the central arcsecond indicate thermal excitation in dense gas similar to what is seen in other agn .",
    "our proposed hst observations request multi - epoch uv through nir imaging to search for definitive evidence of bh accretion in ngc  404 .",
    "our nearby nsc survey includes 13 galaxies within 5  mpc with @xmath243 between -15.9 and -18.8 for which we will have comparable data to that presented here obtained using mmt , vlt , and gemini .",
    "these galaxies span a wide - range of hubble types in which we can examine the process of nsc formation ; there are four early type e / s0 galaxies and 9 spirals of type sc and later .",
    "ngc  404 represents one of the stronger cases for finding a black hole , given its liner emission and proximity . however , we expect to be able detect or place upper limits of @xmath244  m@xmath3 on black holes in each of the sample galaxies .    _ acknowledgments : _ we thank the referee , jenny greene , for helpful comments , stphane charlot for sharing his models , christy tremonti for sharing her code , the staff at gemini and mmt , ned , and ads . as acknowledges support from the harvard - smithsonian cfa as a cfa and oir fellow , and helpful conversations with margaret geller , pat ct , and davor krajnovi .",
