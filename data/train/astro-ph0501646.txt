    "amongst the first results of extragalactic mid - ir astronomy was the discovery of a small number of galaxies that emit the bulk of their bolometric luminosity in the infrared ( low & kleinmann 1968 , kleinmann & low 1970a , b ) .",
    "the infrared astronomical satellite , iras , detected large numbers of these ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) ( soifer et al .",
    "1984 , joseph & wright 1985 , and soifer , neugebauer & houck 1987 ) with quasar - like luminosities of @xmath4@xmath5 . there is still debate as to the nature of the far - ir power source in these galaxies : is the immense thermal energy driven by a dominant starburst , a dominant agn or some combination of the two ?",
    "these low - redshift iras - selected ulirgs are expected to be the counterparts to the high redshift ( @xmath6 ) scuba sources ( see , e.g. , smail et al .",
    "1998 , blain et al .",
    "2002 , webb et al .",
    "2003 , chapman et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "most ulirg systems have been shown to be disturbed , interacting or merging in some way when the separation of nuclei is less than 10kpc ( sanders et al .",
    "1988 , clements et al .",
    "1996 , murphy et al .",
    "1996 , farrah et al .",
    "the nature of widely separated ulirg systems is less clear ( dinh - v - trung et al .",
    "2001 , meusinger et al .",
    "2001 ) : are the components of the ulirg ( supposedly the end phase of the galactic interaction ) beginning another merger or is the ulirg a result of a multiple merger event ( borne et al .",
    "this latter scenario is possible in widely separated ulirgs with resolved double nuclei but might not apply to the ulirg system @xmath3 , which consists of two widely spaced but interacting luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ) , each with a single nucleus .",
    "the two lirgs have a projected separation of 39h@xmath2kpc and a velocity difference of @xmath7 ( duc , mirabel & maza 1997 ) .",
    "in this letter we present 350@xmath1 m resolved images and fluxes for @xmath3 .",
    "we model the far - ir dust emission to constrain the nature of the interaction .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     with only two independent colours we can not constrain the cold and warm dust masses and simultaneously fit the dust temperatures in a two temperature model . using @xmath8=2 ( as in dunne & eales 2001 ) ,",
    "if we assume equal amounts of cold and warm dust in the system we get best - fitting temperatures of @xmath9k and @xmath10k . if we adopt a dust mass distribution typical of the highest luminosity galaxies from the scuba local universe galaxy survey ( slugs ) , as given in dunne & eales ( 2001 ) , we get a ratio @xmath11=11 .",
    "the best - fitting values are then @xmath12k .    as an alternative to these approaches",
    ", we also used a more physically - based dust grain model ( the single temperature dl dust model  draine & lee 1984 , laor & draine 1993 ) , an equal mixture of silicates and graphites with @xmath13 of 31 and 54@xmath14 for the silicate and graphite grains respectively . in this case , the best - fitting temperature of the system was @xmath15k .",
    "the dust temperature of @xmath16 31k is within 1.5@xmath17 of the average temperature of @xmath18k from the previous 350@xmath1 m lirg study by benford ( 1999 ) , with the first sharc camera ( although that survey did not include any widely separated lirg systems ) .",
    "the result that the 60@xmath1 m dust is distributed in very similar ratios to the 350@xmath1 m dust ( figure 3 ) is responsible for the identical sed temperatures for both components .",
    "the molecular gas mass in the western source is @xmath19 ( mirabel et al .",
    "the western source s dust mass is derived from the best - fitting sed to give a molecular gas  to  dust ratio of 140 and 120 for the single temperature and dl dust models respectively . in the absence of 21 cm hi observations",
    "this value is a lower limit on the total ( molecular + atomic ) gas  to  dust ratio .",
    "the 81000@xmath20 m luminosity ( @xmath21 , see table 1 ) gives a value for the western source ir luminosity  to  h@xmath22 mass ratio ( @xmath21/m(h@xmath22 )  the star formation efficiency ) of 42@xmath23 .",
    "the molecular gas  to  dust and ir luminosity  to  h@xmath22 mass ratios are consistent with values for the highest luminosity slugs galaxies ( dunne et al . 2000 ) .    dinh - v - trung et al .",
    "( 2001 ) studied six widely separated ( @xmath24kpc ) ulirg systems in the complete 1jy sample of kim & sanders ( 1998 ) . in their sample , the molecular gas was concentrated in the dominant source of the far - ir emission .",
    "although the western source of @xmath3 is gas - rich , the eastern source , by virtue of the amount of dust , is unlikely to be gas - poor .",
    "this would make this system different from their wide - pair ulirg sample .",
    "the system and component luminosities ( see table 1 ) show that the two components form a ulirg system , though neither is a ulirg individually .",
    "the star formation rate in table 1 uses the sed derived fir luminosities and the relation of thronson @xmath25 telesco ( 1986 ) :    @xmath26    assuming @xmath27 = 1 ( typical values of @xmath27 are 0.82.1 ) .",
    "the optical image from the digitized sky survey ( figure 2 , left ) shows the disturbed morphology of the eastern source . in the 2mass k@xmath28 band image",
    "( figure 2 , centre ) the western source is slightly more luminous than the eastern , a trait even more prominent in the submillimetre ( figure 1 ) .",
    "merger models such as barnes @xmath25 hernquist ( 1991 ) predict gas and dust to be concentrated in the galaxy centre as the ulirg interaction condenses large amounts of the ism into the nuclear region .    line ratios from duc et al .",
    "( 1997 ) classify the western source as a seyfert 2 .",
    "dudley ( 1999 ) found prominent polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon features in the 813@xmath1 m dust emission spectra  indicative of a starburst .",
    "the eastern source is either a seyfert 2 or liner galaxy ( duc et al . 1997 ) , while gonalves , vron - cetty & vron ( 1999 ) also find evidence for a starburst .",
    "neither of the two sources in the @xmath3 system were detected in the rosat all - sky survey .",
    "a non - detection in the rosat band does not necessarily mean that a source is intrinsically weak since the soft x - ray band is sensitive to x - ray absorption , which is common in agn .      without additional submillimetre data we are unable to constrain the relative temperatures and masses of the cold and warm dust components .",
    "whether the dust temperature of the system is related to the stage of merging is not clear .",
    "mazzarella , bothun & boroson ( 1991 ) find an increase in warm dust temperature with merging stage , although klaas et al .",
    "( 2001 ) argue the cold dust temperature would increase as well .",
    "the wide separation of the pair would suggest that @xmath3 is at the beginning of a merger , a notion supported by the value of the ir luminosity  to  h@xmath22 mass ratio , which falls within a region of @xmath29 vs @xmath21 space that is common for early merging systems ( sanders , scoville & soifer 1991 ) .      unlike the wide pair sample of xu & sulentic ( 1991 ) _",
    "both _ components are enhanced in the far - ir . with a velocity difference of @xmath7 ( duc et al .",
    "1997 ) and a projected separation of 39h@xmath2kpc , monte carlo simulations give the probability of the pair being bound as 0.88 ( schweizer 1987 ) .",
    "although widely separated ulirg pairs are not uncommon the nature of their interaction is still uncertain .",
    "murphy et al . ( 1996 ) postulated the presence of a third nucleus in widely separated pairs , though no double nucleus has been detected in either component of @xmath3 .",
    "the galaxies were shown to be unresolved at @xmath30 resolution in a @xmath31 cm search by crawford et al .",
    "however the non - detection of a double nucleus can not rule out a multiple merger since the time - scale of nuclei coalescence is short ( surace , sanders & evans 2000 , meusinger et al .",
    "2001 ) . in multiple approach merger models ( e.g. ,",
    "dubinski , mihos & hernquist 1999 ) the merging process is a series of encounters where bound components approach and separate . a previous encounter may have triggered the starburst / agn in the system .",
    "high resolution optical imaging ( borne et al . 2000 ) could decide between these scenarios by either detecting multiple nuclei or confirming single nuclei .",
    "high resolution co imaging would be needed to detect whether gas has been disturbed by a previous phase of the merging event ( mihos & hernquist 1996 ) .",
    "we have resolved the widely separated ulirg system of @xmath0 with the sharc  ii detector at 350@xmath1 m .",
    "this system comprises two lirgs with a projected separation of 39h@xmath2kpc , or around two optical diameters .",
    "the western component dominates the far - ir flux at both 60@xmath1 m and @xmath32 m , carrying 79 per cent of the total system luminosity .",
    "although the luminosity of the system is large , our fluxes suggest a dust temperature of @xmath33k for this system , with both components at the same temperature to within the sensitivity of this measurement .",
    "the wide separation and the value of the ir luminosity  to  h@xmath22 mass ratio suggest that the pair are at an early stage of interaction .",
    "but the high luminosity of the system ( @xmath34l@xmath35 ) would be unusual for such a stage , unless the components had experienced a previous merger or interaction . a high resolution",
    "optical search for multiple nuclei within each component is needed .",
    "their absence could indicate that the double agn  lirg system of @xmath3 , and perhaps other widely spaced ulirg pairs , might be unexplained by current theories of ulirg formation and evolution .",
    "this research has made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic data base ( ned ) , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory under contract with nasa .",
    "the optical image is taken from photographic data obtained using the uk schmidt telescope .",
    "the caltech submillimeter observatory is supported by nsf contract ast-0229008 .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for their insightful and careful comments .",
    "we are very grateful to pierre - alain duc for providing clarification and additional spectroscopic data for the system , to jason surace for providing his hires - processed iras images , to eli dwek for sed discussion and the dl dust model , and to rick arendt for invaluable idl data analysis advice .",
