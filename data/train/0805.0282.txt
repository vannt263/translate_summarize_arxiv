    "in the late 90 s , back - to - back correlations ( bbc ) among boson - antiboson pairs were established as theoretically expected signatures of in - medium mass modification of hadrons freezing out from a hot and dense medium@xcite .",
    "shortly after , similar bbc was predicted to exist among fermion - antifermion pairs with in - medium modified masses@xcite .",
    "the fermionic ( fbbc ) and the bosonic ( bbbc ) back - to - back correlations can be treated by analogous formalisms , being both positive correlations with unlimited intensity .",
    "their similar behavior is in contrast to what is observed in quantum statistical correlations of identical hadrons ( the hbt effect ) , where bosons with similar momenta have positive correlations , while fermions with similar momenta are anti - correlated .",
    "the two - particle correlation function is defined as @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 , being @xmath7 and @xmath8 the free - particle creation and annihilation operators of scalar quanta , and @xmath9 means thermal averages .",
    "a generalization of wick s theorem for _ locally _ equilibrated systems in @xcite allows the factorization @xmath10 $ ] , where the @xmath11 sign refers to boson as the @xmath12 sign to fermions",
    ". the annihilation ( creation ) operator of the asymptotic , observed bosons with momentum @xmath13 , @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) , is related to the in - medium annihilation ( creation ) operator @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) , corresponding to thermalized quasi - particles , by the bogoliubov - valatin transformation , @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 ; @xmath22 $ ] is called the _ squeezing parameter _ , since the bogoliubov - valatin transformation creates squeezed states from coherent ones . introducing the chaotic and squeezed amplitudes , respectively , as @xmath23 , the bosonic two - particle correlation function can be written as c_2(k_1,k_2 ) = 1 + + , [ fullcorr ] where the first two terms correspond to the hbt correlation , whereas the first and the last terms represent the correlation function between the particle and its antiparticle , i.e. , the squeezing part . in cases where the particle is its own anti - particle ( for @xmath24@xmath24 or @xmath0@xmath0 boson pairs , for instance ) , the full correlation function is to be considered , as in ( [ fullcorr ] ) .",
    "the in - medium modified mass , @xmath25 , is related to the asymptotic mass , @xmath26 , by @xmath27 , here assumed to be a constant mass - shift . for a hydrodynamical ensemble , both the chaotic and the squeezed amplitudes , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively ,",
    "can be written in a special form derived in @xcite , and developed in @xcite .",
    "the formulation was initially derived for a static , infinite medium @xcite .",
    "more recently , it was shown@xcite that , in the case of finite - size systems expanding with moderate flow , the squeezed correlations may survive with sizable strength to be observed experimentally .",
    "a non - relativistic treatment with flow - independent squeezing parameter was adopted for the sake of simplicity , which allowed to obtain analytic results .",
    "the detailed discussion is in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the maximum value of @xmath30 , was studied as a function of the modified mass , @xmath25 , for strict back - to - back pair - momentum , @xmath31 , analogously to focusing on the intercept of the hbt correlation function . in practical terms , however , this was not very helpful to look for the bbc s experimentally , as two measured momenta are never exactly back - to - back . therefore , it was necessary to combine the particles momenta to clearly define variables in terms of which the bbc should be searched for .    within the non - relativistic approach of @xcite , one possibility would be to select the particle - antiparticle pair momenta @xmath32 , combine them as @xmath33 , and analyze the squeezed correlation function in terms of @xmath34 , similarly to what is done in hbt .",
    "since the maximum of the bbc effect is reached when @xmath35 , this value would correspond to the limit @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , the squeezed correlation should be investigated as @xmath37 . for simplicity , in what follows we analyze the behavior of the correlation functions detailed in @xcite by just taking values of @xmath34 and @xmath38 .",
    "naturally , the analysis in terms of the variable @xmath39 would not be suited for a relativistic treatment . in this case , a relativistic momentum variable can be constructed , as @xmath40 .",
    "in fact , it is preferable to redefine this variable as @xmath41 , whose non - relativistic limit is @xmath42 .    ) , which enhances the bbc signal all over the investigated region.,title=\"fig : \" ] ) , which enhances the bbc signal all over the investigated region.,title=\"fig : \" ]    by comparing the results in figure 1a and 1b we see that , in the absence of flow , the squeezed correlation signal grows faster for higher values @xmath38 than the corresponding case in the presence of flow .",
    "however , this last one is stronger even for smaller values of @xmath38 , showing that the presence of flow could help to enhance the signal .",
    "the sensitivity of the squeezed - pair correlation to the system size is shown in figure 2a for radii @xmath43 fm and @xmath44 fm , and is reflected in the inverse width of the curve as function of @xmath45 . in the absence of squeezing , i.e. , if there is no in - medium mass modification , the squeezed correlation functions would be unity for all values of @xmath45 .",
    "fm ( top ) and @xmath44fm ( bottom ) .",
    "part ( b ) shows the hbt correlation function in the absence of squeezing ( top part ) and when it is present ( bottom part ) .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] fm ( top ) and @xmath44fm ( bottom ) . part ( b ) shows the hbt correlation function in the absence of squeezing ( top part ) and when it is present ( bottom part ) .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    the next question to be answered is how the behavior of the @xmath46 hbt would be affected by the in - medium mass modification , since the hbt correlation function also depends on the squeezing factor , @xmath47 . for isolating the hbt effect from the bbc ,",
    "we consider here the zone where the particle - antiparticle correlation is not significant and the hbt is the relevant contribution to ( [ fullcorr ] ) , as shown in figure 2b .",
    "its top part shows only the effect of radial flow on the hbt correlation function , while in its lower part , both the flow and the squeezing effects are shown .",
    "we see that , without squeezing , the flow broadens the curves , as expected , whereas the squeezing effects tend to oppose to those of flow ( for large @xmath34 , it practically cancels the broadening of the correlation function due to flow ) , another striking indication of mass - modification , even in hbt !",
    "in the present work we suggest an effective way to search for the back - to - back squeezed correlations in heavy ion collisions at rhic and later at lhc energies . within a relativistic approach",
    ", we showed that a suitable variable to experimentally search for the squeezed correlation function is the average momentum of the pair , @xmath48 , which is the non - relativistic limit of the proposed variable , @xmath49 .",
    "we showed that , in the presence of flow , the signal is stronger over the momentum regions in the plots , i.e. , roughly for @xmath50 mev and @xmath51 mev , suggesting that flow may enhance the observable bbc signal .",
    "another important point that we find within this simplified model and in the non - relativistic limit considered here is that the squeezing would distort significantly the hbt correlation function as well , tending to oppose to the flow effects on those curves , practically neutralizing it for large values of @xmath38 .",
    "finally , it is important to note that all the effects and signals studied theoretically here would exist only if the particles analyzed had their masses modified by interactions in the hot and dense medium .",
    "if that would not happen , then the squeezed correlation functions would be flat in * 1 * and the hbt correlation functions would behave as usual , either in the presence or absence of flow . however , if the particles masses are indeed modified in - medium , the experimental discovery of squeezed particle - antiparticle correlation ( and the distortions pointed out in the hbt correlations ) would be an unequivocal signature of those effects on hadronic probes , prior to freeze - out .",
