    "tacconi et al .

    "however , we note athat , due to the bandwidth limitation for the early evla , the very lowest frequency ( highest velocity ) emission for gn20 may be truncated by these observations , although the higher order co transitions show that we expect little emission beyond our lowest spectral channel ( daddi et al",
