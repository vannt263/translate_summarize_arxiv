    "the main difference between the two formulations lies in the fact that entropic uncertainty relations only take the probabilities of the different outcomes of a measurement into account , while the in heisenberg uncertainty principle the variances based on uncertainty relations depend also on the measured values ( i.e. , the eigenvalues of the observable ) themselves ( for a detailed discussion on the uncertainty relation for joint measurement refer to @xcite ) . recently",
    ", entropic uncertainty relation has gained an important role in the context of quantum optics @xcite .",

    "entropic uncertainty relations have been studied , for instance , fock states and coherent states @xcite , binomial and negative binomial states @xcite , squeezed states and airy states @xcite and multiphoton coherent states @xcite .",
    "+ on the other side , single mode nonlinear coherent states @xcite or @xmath3-coherent states @xcite have been constructed as right eigenstates of a deformed annihilation operator , @xmath4 where @xmath5 with @xmath6 and @xmath7 as bosonic annihilation and number operator , respectively and so @xmath8 is an intensity dependent function responsible for the nonlinearity of the states .",

    ", we will further explore the relevance of the results obtained in @xcite to other popular information theoretical measure , namely the shannon information entropy @xcite .",
    "in addition , the nonclassical properties of some classes of coherent states associated to a few solvable quantum systems with spectrum @xmath16 will be investigated by studying the _ `` number - phase entropic uncertainty relations''_. we also pay attention to a special distribution function has been called _ `` number - phase wigner function '' _ recently introduced in @xcite .",
    "we will reformulate these two quantities in terms of the spectrum of an arbitrary physical system .",
    "at last we consider gazeau - klauder coherent states as the dynamical evolution of the states in ( [ zen ] ) and study the time evolution of number - phase entropic uncertainty relations and wigner functions for these states .",

    "+ the number and phase operator for a single mode electromagnetic field are conjugate operators . but searching for a hermitian phase operator of radiation field has a long history from the beginnings of quantum electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "there are several different approaches to the problem of quantum phase .",

    "the idea was to perform a polar decomposition of the annihilation operator , similar to the polar decomposition of the complex amplitude performed for classical fields .",
    "unfortunately , although their formalism permits to define associated hermitian operators , it has still a serious problem : it is non - unitary .",
    "holevo introduced another approach @xcite . in this approach the mathematical representation of the concept of quantum observable",
    "is extended from a self - adjoint operator to a normalized positive operator measure ( pom ) and assume that any quantum phase observable is a phase shift covariant pom with the interval @xmath50 as the range of its possible measurement outcomes .",
    "later barnett and pegg @xcite introduced a unitary operator in an extended hilbert space .",
    "the apparent difficulty of the latter proposal is that it included unphysical negative number states . along these efforts ,",
    "a very important development in this field has been made by pegg and barnett @xcite .",
    "they have defined a unitary and hermitian phase operator , and a phase state but in a finite although arbitrarily large subspace whose dimension was allowed to tend to infinity after the calculation of expectation values of observable quantities .",
    "therefore , the pegg - barnett formalism has been extensively employed in recent literature on the phase properties of a wide variety of quantum systems in quantum optics @xcite . moreover",
    ", the pegg - barnett formalism can also be embedded in the covariant approach and lahti et al . showed that this formalism can be extended to cover the covariant theory @xcite .",
