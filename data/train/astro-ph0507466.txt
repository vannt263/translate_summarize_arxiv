    "the present challenge to the observers of the sunyaev - zeldovich effect is the detection of the kinematical sunyaev - zeldovich effect , which is caused by the proper motion of galaxy clusters through cmb . by observing the kinematical sunyaev - zeldovich effect",

    "it is worthwhile to obtain a precision formula for the relativistic corrections to the kinematical sunyaev - zeldovich effect for clusters of galaxies .",
    "nozawa , itoh , & kohyama @xcite have calculated the relativistic corrections to the kinematical sunyaev - zeldovich effect for clusters of galaxies and have obtained a formula that is correct up to the order of @xmath3 where @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 being the electron temperature and electron mass , respectively , and @xmath4 is the magnitude of the peculiar velocity of the galaxy cluster with respect to cmb .",

    "namely , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 terms separately vanish by the integration @xmath69 .",

    "it is also clear from fig .  2 that the @xmath48 correction is very small and it can be safely neglected .",
    "it is well known that the kinematical sunyaev - zeldovich effect becomes extremely important in the crossover frequency region , where the thermal sunyaev - zeldovich effect vanishes .",

    "the integration is carried out consistently over the momentum space in the cmb frame ( equation ( 1 ) ) .",
    "however , shimon and rephaeli appear to have erroneously used the momentum space in the cg frame instead .",
    "this is the likely cause of the discrepancy of shimon and rephaeli s results from ours .",
    "shimon and rephaeli correctly reproduce the @xmath98 term in equation ( 20 ) , and their discrepancy starts at the @xmath99 term . since the contribution of the @xmath99 term with respect to the contribution of the @xmath98 term for the case of @xmath41=0.02 is about 2% for small values of @xmath74 , this explains the results in fig .",
