    "the overall goal of this review is to give a clear overview of over twenty - five years of work  starting even before the seminal paper of kardar - parisi - zhang @xcite in 1986  which has culminated in early 2010 with the discovery of the probability distribution for the solution to the kpz stochastic pde ( not to be confused with the kpz of quantum gravity ) and the understanding that the kpz equation is the universal continuum mechanism for the crossover between the two universality classes associated with growth models : the kpz class and the ew ( edwards wilkinson ) class @xcite .",
    "the clarity which i aim for here is very much a benefit of hindsight , as is the program outlined for how everything fits together .",
    "emphasis will be on the important conceptual steps and calculations involved in this program  not on the many technical challenges and difficulties which arise along the way .",
    "while many of the important developments in the study of the kpz equation will be explained or alluded to , this literature is vast , and will not be surveyed entirely herein .    the introduction to this article is meant to quickly provide the reader with the main results as well as philosophies associated with the kpz equation and its universality class .",
    "while the main focus of this review is on growth processes and their relationship to the kpz equation , in the last section the connections to the study of directed polymers in random media will be illuminated .",
    "this article is focused primarily on the mathematically rigorous side of results pertaining to the kpz equation and universality class .",
    "however , care has been taken to accurately represent the accomplishments of physicists in this area and many of the relevant references are cited ( along with brief discussions ) .",
    "still , it is nearly impossible to be exhaustive in recording the accomplishments of the countless people who have worked in this area and thus the author begs the pardon of anyone whose contribution to the field is overlooked in this article .      since its discovery",
    "two hundred years ago the gaussian distribution has come to represent one of mathematics greatest societal contributions  a robust theory explaining and analyzing much of the randomness inherent in the physical world .",
    "physical and mathematical systems accurately described in terms of gaussian statistics are said to be in the _ gaussian universality class_. this class , however , is not all encompassing .",
    "for example , classical extreme value statistics or poisson statistics better capture the randomness and severity of events ranging from natural disasters to emergency room visits .",
    "recently , significant research efforts have been focused on understanding systems which are not well described in terms of _ any _ of the classically developed statistical universality classes .",
    "the failure of these systems to conform with classical descriptions is generally due to the non - linear relationship between natural observables and underlying sources of random inputs and noise .",
    "a variety of models for such complex systems have been actively studied for over forty years in both mathematics and physics .",
    "history should give great credit to those giants of probability , pdes , representation theory and mathematical / statistical physics who understood that it was worthwhile to dig deep in the study of these systems .",
    "they defined these models , identified links between them and with other fields , pinpointed many mysteries and seriously attacked the most important problems here with a full battery of methods . in light of this work and a few other recent breakthroughs i seek to identify and frame the two problems which are of central importance in the study of these systems : ( 1 ) universality of the scalings , statistics and limit objects , and ( 2 ) solvability and integrability which enables exact formulas and computations for quantities associated with these systems .",
    "these two complementary goals are behind significant amounts of on - going research within probability , mathematical physics and related fields .",
    "this review will focus on three types of systems :    1 .",
    "random growth interfaces and interacting particle systems , 2 .   directed polymers in random media , 3 .",
    "non - linear spdes such as the kpz equation , stochastic heat equation ( she ) with multiplicative noise and stochastic burgers equation .",
    "a number of books and review articles have been written about these models in mathematics and physics , including @xcite .",
    "though not directly addressed here , the study of these systems is closely related to and influenced by problems in random matrix theory , non - intersecting path ensembles , random tilings and certain combinatorial problems involving asymptotic representation theory @xcite .",
    "in particular , many ( but not all ) of the statistics which arise in these systems were first analytically discovered in the context of random matrix theory .    in all of these types of models",
    "there are certain observables of interest ( such as height functions , particle currents , free energy , or eigenvalues ) which have random fluctuations that have been shown , through experimental evidence , numerical simulations and in some cases mathematical proof , to grow as a characteristic power law in the systems size or time . in the case of the classical central limit theorem",
    "this power law would have an exponent of @xmath0 and the limiting distribution for the scaled fluctuations would be gaussian .",
    "this , however , is not the case here .",
    "surprisingly for all of the above listed models the observables of interest fluctuate with a scaling exponent of @xmath1 and display the same set of non - gaussian limiting distributions .",
    "that is to say that they form a new universality class  the _ kpz universality class_.      let us now briefly illustrate the difference between the gaussian and kpz universality classes .",
    "all of the models considered here are @xmath2 dimensional , meaning that there is one space and one time dimension . in the context of growth models",
    "this means that the growing interface is given by a curve ( as opposed to a surface  a problem of great interest but few predictions and even fewer results ) .",
    "the _ random deposition _ growth model involves square blocks being stacked in columns ( indexed by @xmath3 ) .",
    "growth is driven by independent poisson processes ( one for each column ) of blocks falling from above and accumulating on top of the growing stacks of blocks . due to the independence",
    ", each column evolves independently ( i.e. , with no spatial correlation ) while the height at time @xmath4 fluctuates like @xmath5 and is governed by the gaussian distribution ( due to the classical central limit theorem ) .",
    "the _ ballistic deposition _ growth model ( shown in figure 0b ) involves the same independent process of blocks falling in each column , however a block sticks to the first block it touches .",
    "so if a block falls in column @xmath6 but the height of column @xmath7 is larger than that of column @xmath6 , the block will stick to the side of column @xmath7 and the height of column @xmath6 will suddenly jump to equal that of @xmath7 .",
    "this important modification breaks the independence of the column heights and importantly introduces spatial correlation .",
    "the salient features of this model ( and all growth models in the kpz universality class ) are threefold :    1 .",
    "* smoothing : * deep holes are rapidly filled to smooth the interface .",
    "* rotationally invariant , slope dependent , growth speed : * the larger the absolute value of the slope , the larger the height tends to increase .",
    "* space - time uncorrelated noise : * the blocks fall spatially and temporally independently .    based on these three features",
    "it is predicted that in time @xmath4 the column height will fluctuate around its mean like @xmath8 and that the correlation of these fluctuations will be non - trivial on a spatial scale of @xmath9 ( in sharp contrast to random deposition ) .",
    "this prediction has not been proved . however , in the case of the _ corner growth model _ ( see figure 0a ) the same predictions have been proved @xcite . we too will focus on the corner growth model  not ballistic deposition .",

    "@xcite predicted that scaling exponent of @xmath1 and @xmath22 should describe the fluctuations and correlations for a large class of models , stable under varying model parameters such as underlying probability distributions or local rules .",
    "these exponents had first been identified in 1977 by @xcite in the study of the stochastic burgers equation ( stochastic space - time noise , not initial data as studied in @xcite ) . in 1985",
    "the model of a directed polymer in random media was first formulated in @xcite and in the same year the scaling exponents for the driven lattice gas ( the asymmetric simple exclusion process ) were discovered by @xcite .",
    "the connections between polymers and lattice gases were understood quickly @xcite .",
    "the big step of kardar , parisi and zhang was therefore to relate these models and calculations to interface motion in arbitrary dimensions .",
    "this both broadened the universality class of models which shared characteristic exponents as well as provided obvious physical realizations of the universality class .",
    "their observations caught the imagination of many and the paper deserves the full credit of having triggered a large number of investigations .",
    "examples of physical phenomena modeled by the kpz class include turbulent liquid crystals @xcite , crystal growth on a thin film @xcite , facet boundaries @xcite , bacteria colony growth @xcite , paper wetting @xcite , crack formation @xcite , and burning fronts @xcite .",
    "the scaling exponent predictions of @xcite were based on studying a continuum stochastically growing height function @xmath23 given in term of a stochastic pde ( ill - posed however ) which is now known as the _ kpz equation_. the time derivative of the height function depends on three factors ( the same as highlighted for the ballistic deposition model ) : smoothing ( the laplacian ) , rotationally invariant , slope dependent , growth speed ( the square of the gradient ) , noise ( space - time white noise ) .",
    "@xmath24 here @xmath25 is space - time white noise and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are non - zero parameters which can often be ( heuristically ) computed for a particular growth model directly from the microscopic dynamics .",
    "when one of these parameters is computed to be zero , this is indicative of the growth model not being in the kpz class ( for instance when @xmath28 this is the ew class ) .",
    "we will specialize the parameters to the values @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 and thus refer to the kpz equation as @xmath32 however , nothing is lost in doing this since the general solution @xmath33 ( the subscripts emphasize the coefficients ) to the kpz equation can be recovered by a combination of change of variables and rescaling as @xmath34    it has been argued in the physics literature that the long time behavior of this equation should be the same as that of a variety of physical systems as well as mathematical models which share these three features  hence the belief in the wide universality of the kpz class . besides universality of the scaling exponents , there quickly developed a belief that the asymptotic long time scaling limit probability distributions ( also called amplitudes ) were universal ( within certain geometry dependent subclasses ) .    in the years following @xcite",
    "it became a very hot subject in the physics literature to try to both demonstrate the scaling exponents as well as compute or estimate properties of these universal scaling limit probability distributions .",
    "many ( mathematically non - rigorous ) approaches  both analytical and numerical  were employed to gather more information about the kpz universality class and its inhabitants .",
    "these included replica methods , matrix models , field theory methods , saddle point equations , mode coupling equations , perturbation theory , and monte - carlo simulations ( see @xcite for references and examples of many of these approaches ) .",
    "these early papers worked to establish in broad terms and via brute force numerical methods , the full notation of kpz universality .",
    "most of these focused on flat geometries ( as it was easier to simulate ) and calculated statistics for the height function fluctuations for various models . via monte - carlo methods the skew and kurtosis were approximated in @xcite and in @xcite a rough plot of the distribution function was given for both a growth model and a polymer model ( and they agreed ) .",
    "still , an exact and analytic description of the statistics ( probability distributions ) associated with the kpz class went entirely unknown until , in the late 1990s , a group of mathematicians determined the exact formula for the one - point statistics of the kpz class ( in the wedge growth geometry corresponding to figure 0a ) . that seminal work of baik , deift and johansson @xcite dealt with two closely related discrete models ( polynuclear , and corner growth ) predicted to have the kpz scaling . by using exact formulas ( arising from combinatorics and representation theory ) and then by studying asymptotics of the resulting expressions , @xcite were able to calculate the statistics of the one - point fluctuations for these kpz class models .",
    "surprisingly these statistics had been discovered in the early 90s by tracy and widom in the context of random matrix theory @xcite .",
    "the previous numerical work of the 1990s agreed with the values readily computed from the exact formulas @xcite .",
    "experimental work has shown that the scalings and the statistics for the kpz class are excellent fits for certain physical phenomena .",
    "of note is the recent work of @xcite on liquid crystal growth ( see also @xcite for other experimental evidence ) .    even before the work of baik , deift and johansson , the kpz class and equation were topics of interest in mathematics",
    "however , after their work the field blossomed ( for instance there have been two semester long msri programs focused in this direction ) . in the past ten years",
    "there has been a significant amount of refinement of the theory of the kpz universality class .",
    "for instance , it is now understood that while the @xmath1 and @xmath22 scaling exponents occur for all models , the exact statistics of kpz class models fall into different subclasses based on the growth geometry , or initial / boundary data ( see figure [ sixfig ] ) .",
    "the long - time statistics have been written down explicitly for six of these subclasses which , arguably are the most important phenomenalogically .",
    "one should be clear now that all of the mathematically rigorous results until recently involving exact statistics have been for models which are believed to be in the kpz universality class , but not for the kpz equation itself .",
    "in fact , before 2010 very little was known of the exact statistics of the solution to the kpz equation itself .",
    "one stumbling block is that the kpz equation is mathematically ill - posed due to its non - linearity ( the function @xmath35 is believed to be locally brownian and so it does nt make sense to square its derivative ) .",
    "however , this issue was essentially resolved in the mid-1990s by bertini - giacomin @xcite who provided a convincing interpretation for what it means to solve the kpz equation .",
    "first they formally defined the _ hopf - cole solution _ to the kpz equation as @xmath36 where @xmath37 satisfies the well - posed she ( stochastic heat equation ) @xmath38 they then proved that the discrete hopf - cole transform of the height function for a certain kpz class model ( the corner growth model ) converged weakly as a space - time process to the solution to the stochastic heat equation .",
    "their work required a special sort of scaling which is called _ weakly asymmetric _ scaling , and only applied to the growth model started close to its stationary distribution .",
    "the interpretation of this result , however , is strikingly clear  up to this odd transformation and scaling , the discrete growth model converges to the kpz equation .",
    "this hopf - cole interpretation had been used previously ( though without the justification provided by @xcite ) in the physics literature for some time .",
    "other attempts at interpreting the kpz equation ( such as @xcite ) have resulted in solutions which are considered to be physically irrelevant as their solutions have very different long - time scaling behavior @xcite .    since the kpz equation is a fundamental mathematical / physical object",
    ", one would hope to be able to write down and prove the exact probability distribution of its solution and show that its long time limit is governed by the kpz class scaling and statistics ",
    "i.e. , that the * kpz equation is in the kpz universality class .",
    "*    this long - standing goal was achieved in the fall of 2009 ( and posted in spring 2010 ) .",
    "two groups ( independently and in parallel ) derived the exact formula for the one - point statistics for the solution to the kpz equation @xcite .",
    "in addition to a derivation , @xcite provided the highly non - trivial mathematical proof of the formula .",
    "[ acqmainthm ] for any @xmath39 and @xmath40 , the hopf - cole solution to kpz with _",

    "special thanks to s. prolhac and h. spohn for permission to reproduce these plots from @xcite . ]      in order to properly understand the above crossover we shall see that the kpz equation arises as the scaling limit of the corner growth model under weak asymmetry ( we will soon specify in section [ asymsym ] exactly what this means ) .",
    "in section [ asymsym ] we will observe , however , for any positive asymmetry the corner growth model is in the kpz class , while for zero asymmetry it is in the ew class .",
    "this entire picture of the kpz equation being the weakly asymmetric limit of the corner growth model , and having statistics which crossover between universality classes just further confirms a mantra in statistical physics that at critical points ( in this case the interface between universality classes ) one can expect to see universal scaling objects . in this case",
    "that object is the kpz equation , though other examples abound .",
    "analogous to our case is the fact that the scaling limit for critical percolation ( on the hexagonal lattice ) is governed by sle6 .    to motivate this whole pursuit and approach ,",
    "it is useful to draw upon a rather simple analogy with the story of random walks and brownian motion .",
    "there are a wide ( infinite ) variety of random walks .",
    "however , assuming the jumps have finite second moment , if you subtract off their linear drift , and scale properly , they all converge to a single ( hence universal ) continuum object  the brownian motion .    in that case",
    ", the benefit of having a single limiting object is enormous .",
    "as long as one is dealing with a suitably long time - scale , the above result shows that all such random walks essentially look similar .",
    "thus , if we compute properties of the brownian motion , these will ( with a little care ) imply similar ( and exact in the limit ) results for the random walks .",
    "this observation can be thought of as the basis for gaussian statistics .",
    "because of its importance , the properties of brownian motion have been incessantly studied and results pertaining to its properties fills countless volumes of books and research articles . in particular , a calculus was developed for the brownian motion .",
    "when it comes to proving properties of the brownian motion there are many approaches .",
    "however , it is informative to recall that the earliest approach , taken by de moivre , was to consider a particularly _ solvable discrete model _  the simple symmetric random walk . in that setting he took asymptotics of binomial coefficients to compute the limiting gaussian distribution . even though now the techniques have evolved past relying on such simple models to prove properties of the brownian motion , early on such solvable models were essential .    presently , the state - of - the - art in solving for the statistics of the kpz equation is analogous to taking asymptotics of binomial coefficients .",
    "it is only through exactly solvable discrete models ( which can be proved to converge to the kpz equation ) that one is able to compute _ anything _ about the kpz equation rigorously . as far as universality of the kpz equation as a scaling limit , few doubt it , but presently it is only known rigorously to arise in the particular case of the corner growth model .",
    "however , the kpz equation is essentially equivalent to the free energy of a continuum directed random polymer model , and within the study of directed polymers , it is simpler to prove universality of the continuum model ( see section [ freeecdrp ] ) .",
    "there are two main steps involved in the proof of the above theorem ",
    "the first is a universality result and the second a solvability result ( these are both explained in greater depth in section [ talk1 ] and [ talk2 ] respectively ) . the first step is to rigorously relate the corner growth model to the hopf - cole solution to kpz with narrow - wedge initial data .",
    "bertini - giacomin s earlier work @xcite _ does not apply _ to the wedge geometry since it is very far from stationary initial data .",
    "in fact , a new term appears in the scaling and in @xcite it is necessary to provide a proof that under this corrected scaling , the kpz equation arises ( the proof of this result certainly draws on the work of @xcite though ) .    to fix notation , @xmath70 represents the height function for the corner growth model at time @xmath71 above position @xmath72 .",
    "the @xmath73 is the asymmetry and is given by @xmath74 where @xmath18 is the growth rate and @xmath19 is the death rate ( see figure 0a or section [ ipssec ] ) .",
    "wedge initial condition corresponds to @xmath75 .",
    "this first step is summarized in the following :    [ acqbgthm ] fix wedge initial conditions . for @xmath76 set @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 ( recall @xmath80 and @xmath81 ) and define the discrete hopf - cole transformed height function as @xmath82 let @xmath83 denote the probability measure on space - time processes in @xmath84 ( here @xmath85 refers to right continuous paths with left limits in the topology of uniform convergence on compact sets )",
    ". then @xmath86 , for @xmath87 , are a tight family of measures and the unique limit point is supported on @xmath88 ( continuous in both space and time ) and corresponds to the solution of the she with delta function initial data @xmath89 .",
    "the second step is to use the recently discovered exact formulas of tracy and widom @xcite for the corner growth model height function , and take their weakly asymmetric limit .",
    "[ tw ] consider the corner growth model with wedge initial conditions and with @xmath90 such that @xmath80 .",
    "let @xmath91 and @xmath92 . for @xmath93 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 @xmath94 where @xmath95 is a positively oriented circle centered at zero of radius strictly between @xmath96 and 1 , and where the kernel of the determinant is given by @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 are on @xmath100 ,",
    "a circle centered at zero of radius strictly between @xmath96 and @xmath101 , and the @xmath102 integral is on @xmath103 , a circle centered at zero of radius strictly between @xmath101 and @xmath104 , and where @xmath105    it is relatively straight - forward to guess the correct limiting formula ( and hence guess the exact formula for the kpz equation ) as we demonstrate in section [ wasepsec ] .",
    "however , to make these asymptotics rigorous requires a significant amount of work . besides the usual complications involved in proving uniformity and tail bounds ( for the purpose of trace - class convergence ) , there is a major technical issue one encounters in the asymptotics .",
    "briefly put , the heart of the asymptotics involves taylor expanding the function @xmath106 around a critical point @xmath107 and showing that , in rescaled coordinates , along one contour ( @xmath108 ) @xmath106 rapidly goes to @xmath109 away from @xmath107 and along the other contour ( @xmath103 ) @xmath106 rapidly goes to @xmath110 away from @xmath107 . to facilitate this ,",
    "one generally wants to deform the two contours to be very far from each other ( for instance one contour leaves @xmath107 at angle @xmath111 and the other at @xmath112 ) .",
    "however , due to the weak asymmetry scaling , the two contours of interest can not be deformed as such since doing so one would cross a diverging number of poles as indicated by the restriction from the function @xmath113 that @xmath114 .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to prove that despite staying extremely close together , one can still choose contours which have the desired opposing decay properties . a priori",
    "it is far from clear that this is possible . @xcite",
    "explicitly shows it is possible and give the necessary contours and estimates .      before going further we should remark on the chronology of the solution to the kpz equation",

    "the derivation ( unsurprisingly ) relied on a similar approach .",
    "amir - corwin - quastel s work contains a complete and rigorous proof of the exact formula ( and in particular dealt carefully with the technically involved asymptotic analysis of the tracy - widom corner growth model solution mentioned above ) and the necessary extension of the work of bertini - giacomin away from near - stationary initial data .",
    "additionally , they showed that the solution satisfies a certain extension of the painlev ii equation , suggesting a relationship to integrable systems .",
    "sasamoto - spohn derive the exact formula as well as provide detailed numerical plots of the newly discovered statistics , compute the long - time correction to the tracy - widom gue distribution , notice certain connections with @xmath18 combinatorial identities and explain the physical context of the kpz equation in detail .",
    "certain points in the derivation , however , proceed without rigorous mathematical justification .",
    "the first is in the application of bertini - giacomin s convergence theorem ( which does not apply in this setting and must be replaced by @xcite , theorem 1.3  resulting in a @xmath115 shift in the height function ) . instead ,",
    "@xcite determine that this should be the necessary shift by using a first moment fitting argument .",
    "the second point is in freely deforming contours during asymptotic analysis ( when in fact there is a very restrictive condition on contour manipulations imposed by the critical scaling of the formulas of tracy and widom ) .",
    "the deformation through many poles should introduce a diverging correction to their formula which , however in later manipulations , is luckily canceled and results in a correct final formula .    at the same time , a very different ( and mathematically non - rigorous ) approach was pursued by two groups of physicists , dotsenko @xcite and calabrese - le doussal - rosso @xcite .",
    "the @xmath116 moment of @xmath117 satisfies a closed evolution equation which coincide with the quantum many body system known as the attractive @xmath118-bose gas on @xmath119 with @xmath120 particles .",
    "the eigenfunctions for this system were found by mcguire @xcite in 1964 , and the norms of these eigenfunctions were determined using the algebraic bethe ansatz ( for instance @xcite ) in @xcite in 2007 .",
    "going from the moments of @xmath117 to its distribution ( or the distribution of its logarithm ) is mathematically unsound since one readily checks that the moments grow like @xmath121 which means that the moment problem is ill - posed .",
    "this is a classic issue in replica trick calculations and necessitates summing highly divergent series and performing unjustified analytic continuations . in january 2010",
    "dotsenko @xcite posted an attempt at this , but admittedly got the wrong answer .",
    "likewise , in february 2010 in the first posted version of @xcite , calabrese , le doussal and rosso find formulas which do not have the tracy - widom gue distribution as the long - time asymptotics .",
    "in late march both groups realized the correct way to sum the divergent series and get a fredholm determinant and in the end they were able to show agreement of their formulas with those of sasamoto - spohn and amir - corwin - quastel . despite the inherent lack of mathematical rigor in this approach ,",
    "these methods have proved to be powerful and have lead to certain predictions which can not yet be confirmed rigorously ( see section [ replicasec ] for more about this approach ) .",
    "a growth model is considered to be in the kpz universality class if its long time behavior is similar to that of the kpz equation itself .",

    "they represent generalizations of path integrals through disordered potentials and are thus useful ways of solving stochastic ( partial ) differential equations ; they are useful for solving and formalizing many optimization problems , including important problems in bio - statistics @xcite and operations research @xcite ; they arise in the study of branching brownian motions and random walks in random environments @xcite ; they serve as paradigms for the study of other disordered systems @xcite ; and phenomena like pinning and wetting @xcite . on top of that , their relationship to random growth models and interacting particle systems means that any exact solvability developed in the framework of polymers , can be translated ( at least at the continuum level ) into exact solvability of the associated continuum growth models or particle systems ( spdes ) .",
    "add to these topics the connections to combinatorics and integrable systems ( see @xcite for example ) and it is clear why polymers have received so much interest in recent years .      let us start at the level of physics and write down the following expression for the free energy of the cdrp : @xmath228\\ ] ] where the expectation @xmath229 is over brownian bridges @xmath230 such that @xmath231 and @xmath232 , and @xmath233 is known as the _ wick exponential_. observe that @xmath234 is random with respect to the disorder ( the gaussian space - time white noise @xmath25 ) .",
    "if one considers the white noise as a random potential in which paths arrange themselves according to a boltzmann weight has been set to equal 1 , though rescaling time like @xmath235 and space like @xmath236 effectively reintroduces this factor ] , then @xmath237 is the partition function for this ensemble and @xmath238 is the free energy .",
    "mathematically , equation ( [ cdrpfreeenergy ] ) requires some work to make rigorous and in section [ approxsec ] we give the following five schemes to define / approximate the free energy of the cdrp  all of which are equivalent in that they can be shown to lead to the same object .",
    "they are :    1 .   chaos series and time ordering , 2 .",
    "stochastic pdes , 3 .",
    "spatial smoothing of the white noise , 4 .   discrete directed polymers , 5 .",
    "growth processes and interacting particle systems .",
    "the fourth and fifth scheme are perhaps most interesting from a physical perspective . that growth processes and interacting particles systems would be related to the cdrp",
    "is initially unclear .",
    "however , one may recognize that the path integral in the definition of the free energy can be interpreted , via a version of the feynman kac formula , as the solution to the she with multiplicative white noise .",
    "thus the free energy is closely related to the kpz equation , which we have seen is a continuum growth model .",
    "the connection between polymers and growth models was previously observed only at the level of zero - temperature polymers ( last passage percolation ) and totally asymmetric growth models ( the corner growth model with @xmath130 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that while everything so far has been focused on the case of the point - to - point polymer , it is possible to likewise consider other initial potentials in which the polymer optimizes its starting position .",
    "this corresponds with different initial data for the she , to different growth geometries for the growth models and to different initial conditions for the particle systems ( see section [ beyondptpt ] ) .",
    "having established above that the cdrp and its free energy / partition function is a truly universal object , it is of great interest to compute scaling exponents , exact and asymptotic statistics , and the answers to various other probabilistic questions related to this random processes .",
    "this direction has seen an explosion of progress in the past three years .",
    "there are essentially three approaches which have been recorded so far , and each one seems to uncover new structure and expand the scope of what can be computed .",
    "we list them chronologically in order of discovery .",
    "all but the replica trick provide rigorous means to access information about the cdrp ( though the replica trick is useful none - the - less for deriving new formulas ) .",
    "these approaches are explained in section [ solvablepolymers ] .    1 .   the tracy widom asep ( or equivalently corner growth model ) formulas , 2 .   the replica trick and bethe ansatz , 3 .   the solvable finite temperature polymers .",
    "the first approach greatly extends work of @xcite , while the third approach likewise extends the solvability of the zero temperature polymer models ( last passage percolation ) via the robinson - schensted - knuth correspondence ( studied at length since the work of @xcite in the late 1990s ) to the positive temperature setting .",
    "the replica trick has been used to study the cdrp since the work of kardar @xcite but only recently developed to the point of yielding formulas for statistics .      in this section",
    "we briefly highlight a few important open questions ( and any partial progress towards resolving them ) .    1 .   * the full scope of solvability for the kpz equation : * figure [ sixfig ] highlighted the fact that for the kpz equation we presently do not have one - point distribution results for four of the six fundamental initial data for which we expect solvability .",
    "moreover , we do not have any rigorous results for spatial processes for the kpz equation at finite time and it is not clear whether the formula derived in @xcite via replica trick is correct ( as they note , it is under a false factorization assumption that they derive the finite @xmath54 formula and it is only in the large @xmath54 limit that the factorization seems to be correct and they recover the airy@xmath239 process ) .",
    "+ in a related question one would like to understand tracy and widom s exact formulas through a more systematic and algebraic perspective in which their combinatorial identities have meaning .",
    "such an understanding could enable extensions of their approach to more general initial data and multi - point distributions .",
    "* the multi - layer free energy process : * the image of exponential weight matrices under the rsk correspondence can be projected to a measure on partitions where the lengths of the partition equal ( in distribution ) the eigenvalues of the lageurre unitary ensemble of random matrix theory .",
    "it is only the top level of the partition ( or eigenvalue ) which we have focused on above .",
    "however , the entire collection of top eigenvalues rescales to a non - trivial point process ( which can further be extended into a multi - layer extension of the airy@xmath239 process .",
    "+ it was observed in @xcite ( and then further discussed in @xcite that there exists a similar multi - layer process extension to the free energy of finite temperature polymers  and in particular the cdrp .",
    "it is of interest to study the finite @xmath54 statistics of this multi - layer process and derive finite @xmath54 versions of many of the processes associated with classical random matrix theory .",
    "* path properties : * the entire multi - layer free energy process , as well as the multi - layer airy@xmath239 scaling limit , should have certain nice path properties .",
    "the first property is that every path should be locally absolutely continuous with respect to brownian motion .",
    "this have been shown in @xcite for the multi - layer airy@xmath239 . along the way to proving that result @xcite proves that the entire ensemble of lines in the multi - layer airy@xmath239 process has a brownian gibbs resampling property  which is to say that removing a portion of the @xmath240 line between @xmath241 and @xmath242 , one can resample according to a brownian bridge conditioned to start and end at the correct locations and to avoid the @xmath243 and @xmath244 line .",
    "the result of this resampling is a new configuration of lines which is distributionally equivalent to the original configuration .",
    "such a property should hold for the finite temperature multi - layer free energy process .",
    "* large deviations and the painlev ii like expression of @xcite : * the tails of the tracy and widom @xmath245 @xcite distribution decay differently  the upper tail decays like @xmath246 while the lower tail decays like @xmath247 .",
    "the lower tail exponent was particularly difficult to derive and required the connection with painlev ii established in @xcite .",
    "one would like to compute similar tail estimates for the finite @xmath54 solution to the kpz equation as in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "an integro - differential equation generalizing the painlev ii equation was derived .",
    "however , it has not yet been analyzed to the point of being able to prove tail estimates of the sort described above , nor has the connection with integrable systems been sufficiently understood ( for instance whether it arises in relation to inverse scattering as in @xcite ) . in @xcite",
    "some upper tail estimates are derived for various kpz initial conditions .",
    "* universality : * the universality conjecture roughly says that ( within reason ) changing local rules of a model will not affect the global or scaling limit behavior .",
    "for instance , for random matrix theory changing the distribution of random variable matrix entries or the type of eigenvalue potential does not affect the limiting statistics for eigenvalues .",
    "herein we have considered a number of types of systems including growth models , particle systems and polymers .",
    "we are particularly interested in universality of the kpz equation ( hence studying these systems under weak asymmetry ) . for polymers this goal is in progress in the work of @xcite . for growth models and particle systems",
    "the only universality results are those of @xcite which deal only with the corner growth model / simple exclusion process .",
    "+ it is of great interest to prove that for more general particle systems the kpz equation still arises .",
    "for instance one could consider the exclusion process with jumps beyond just nearest neighbor . or also jump rates which depend on the local environment .",
    "work of @xcite deals with these more general processes and shows tightness of the fluctuation field within a class of so called `` energy solutions '' to the kpz equation .",
    "this class certainly contains the unique hopf - cole solution ( by virtue of the work of @xcite ) but it is far from clear whether it is the only element of whether there are ( possibly infinitely ) many other energy solutions .",
    "+ another form of universality is with respect to the scaling exponents .",
    "a result which might reach beyond the limited class of exactly solvable models is @xcite were exponents are derived for a class of zero range processes that are defined by the requirement that the slode of the nondecreasing , concave jump rate function decrease geometrically .",
    "* other questions : * without commenting on them , it is worth noting three other important questions . the first deals with proving the conjectural description and formulas of @xcite with regards to the renormalization fixed point for the kpz universality class . the second deals with making sense of the kpz equation and cdrp in more than one spatial dimension ( see @xcite for some polymer results in higher dimensions ) . and the third deals with the still mysterious connections between the classes of models discussed above and random matrix theory .      the introductory section above contained the statement of a number of important results , a discussion of the kpz universality class and subclasses , and an overview of the material which follows .",
    "in section [ talk1 ] we present the rigorous connection between the wasep and the kpz equation and explain step by step how one goes about proving such a connection . in section [ talk2 ] we show how , by using that connection and the explicit work of tracy and widom , one can derive the exact statistics for the kpz equation .",
    "we also explain some of the important and highly non - trivial technical issues one must overcome to make such a derivation rigorous . in section [ talk3 ]",
    "we review the theory of directed polymers in random media and show how the continuum directed random polymer ( cdrp ) is a universal scaling limit for a wide class of such models .",
    "we then review developments in the solvability of random polymers and the kpz equation .",

    "i would also like to thank all those who attended these lectures and encouraged me to turn these into a survey article .",

    "ongoing support from the nsf through the pire grant oise-07 - 30136 is acknowledged and appreciated .",
    "in the original 1986 paper of kardar , parisi and zhang @xcite , it is predicted that the eponymous ( kpz ) equation captures the behavior of the fluctuations of a wide class of discrete models .",
    "this prediction was rather vague , however , and did not explain exactly in what sense the continuum equation should be related to the discrete models .",
    "still , it led to a prediction for the long time fluctuation scaling exponents for many physical systems and mathematical models  which have since been shown to be startlingly accurate in certain cases .",
    "even though the scaling exponents are universal through a wide class of models , @xcite made no predictions about the exact statistics .",
    "subsequent works in mathematics have revealed an additional level of universality  that the statistics seem to only depend on certain model characteristics such as the growth geometry , and are otherwise universal across different models .",
    "there are now also reasonably well developed conjectures about large classes of models which are in the kpz universality class ( see for instance the review of @xcite ) .    the purpose of this section is to explain how to make rigorous sense of the relationship between discrete models and the kpz equation .",
    "we will focus mainly on a single discrete growth model called the _ corner growth model _ and its connection , under a particular type of weakly asymmetric scaling , to the kpz equation .",
    "the below diagram records three levels of discrete and continuous processes and their relationship which is rigorously proved at the top level .",
    "the relationship between the discrete corner growth and continuum kpz equation exists only under a specific weakly asymmetric scaling for the corner growth model .",
    "it was the work of bertini - giacomin @xcite that first rigorously proved this fact ( they focused entirely on the model near stationary initial data ) .",
    "they considered this scaling in terms of hydrodynamics and interpreted the kpz equation as the fluctuations one sees upon looking past the hydrodynamic scaling . in section [ critscalingobject ]",
    "we saw how one can also interpret this weak asymmetry as scaling into the critical point between two universality classes ( the kpz class and the ew or edwards - wilkinson class ) .",
    "the kpz class arises when there is positive asymmetry and the ew class when their is zero asymmetry .",
    "the recent success in computing the statistics of the kpz equation shows indeed that the kpz equation really represents a crossover in scaling and statistics between these two extremes .",
    "we now set out and briefly explain the four tasks of rigorously relating the corner growth model to the kpz equation which will be the focus of this section ( see figure [ bgroute ] for an illustration of these steps ) :    1 .",
    "* define the corner growth model spde : * we provide an spde for the corner growth model and show how it arises from considering an interactive particle system called the simple exclusion process ( sep ) .",
    "we will also say a bit about the hydrodynamic theory ( lln ) for this system .",
    "2 .   * make rigorous sense of the kpz equation : * we will address the question of how to define what it means to solve the ill - posed kpz equation .",
    "we will provide a definition for the _ hopf - cole solution to kpz _ which is defined as @xmath248 where @xmath117 solve the stochastic heat equation which is well - posed .",
    "differentiating the kpz equation yields the stochastic burgers equation .",
    "* grtner s discrete hopf - cole transform : * we will show that , miraculously , applying the hopf - cole transform to the corner growth model results in a discrete version of the she .",
    "* convergence of discrete she to continuum she under weak asymmetry : * we will follow the work of bertini - giacomin , and the extension of @xcite , @xcite , to show how we can prove space - time process convergence of the discrete to continuum solution of the she .      in the introductory section we informally defined the simple exclusion process ( sep ) , and then by integration , the corner growth model .",
    "presently we will show how to rigorously construct the dynamics of the sep , and in doing so we will write down a stochastic pde for the corner growth model height function .",
    "the sep is a continuous time , discrete space markov process .",
    "its state space can be written in terms of occupation variables @xmath249 or spin variables @xmath250 ( related by @xmath251 ) : @xmath252      one can define the process in terms of its markov generator . however",

    "likewise , if @xmath132 then only the viscosity term ( the laplacian ) remains and under the same @xmath297 time scaling the heat equation governs the evolution of the limit shape .",

    ", kpz predicted that in a large time @xmath4 , fluctuations should live on the scale of @xmath8 and should display non - trivial correlation to spatial scales of @xmath9 .",
    "that is to say that time : space : fluctuations should scale like 3 : 2 : 1 .",
    "thereafter any growth model which displayed such scalings was said to be in the _ kpz universality class_. these exponent predictions ( made via non - rigorous dynamic renormalization group methods ) are based on the fact that the ( formal ) derivative of the solution to the kpz equation solves the stochastic burgers equation .",
    "the work of forster , nelson and stephen @xcite from 1977 provides the relevant results then to deduce these exponents .",

    "the techniques used in these rigorous proofs were very different than the non - rigorous approach of @xcite and the approach used in @xcite rigorously computes the associated probability distribution for the narrow wedge initial data fluctuations .",
    "two points should be emphasized about the kpz paper .",
    "the first is that , despite giving a heuristic explanation for each of the terms in their equation , kpz gave no hint as to how one would actually derive the kpz equation from a discrete growth model .",
    "the second point is that they gave absolutely no predictions about the exact nature of the statistics associated with the fluctuations .",
    "as people began to realize the far reaching importance of the kpz universality class , these two questions became active subjects of research within the physics community .",
    "there have been many heuristic derivations of the kpz equation from microscopic models @xcite . however , the only derivation which makes mathematical sense is that of bertini and giacomin @xcite .",
    "the exact nature of the statistics of models in the kpz universality class was studied by a battery of methods and too much avail ( see the discussion at the end of section [ kpzpred ] ) . however , despite all of this work , exact an analytic formulas for the statistics of models in the kpz universality class went unknown until mathematicians entered the story .",
    "in 1999 , baik , deift and johansson @xcite and johansson @xcite gave the first rigorous proofs of the @xmath1 fluctuation exponent for growth models .",
    "moreover , the also proved exact formulas for the statistics of the fluctuations ( in the @xmath8 scale ) .",
    "it came as a surprise to both the physics and mathematics communities that the kpz class statistics were identical to the statistics describing the largest eigenvalue of a random ( gaussian ) hermitian matrix .",
    "these statistics had been discovered by tracy and widom @xcite in the early 1990s and are now often called the tracy - widom gue distribution and notated as @xmath179 or @xmath302 ( we will stick with the first ) .",
    "the spatial correlation exponent as well as exact statistics for multi point distributions was first worked out by prhofer and spohn @xcite in 2002 for the wedge geometry . since",
    "then the spatial correlation statistics for the other five geometries of the kpz universality class have similarly been worked out ( see section [ growthregimesec ] of the introduction for a chart recording all of these statistics and geometries ) .    until the recent work of tracy and widom , however , all of the exact statistics results pertained to growth models were for totally asymmetric models with only growth ( and no means for interfaces to recede ) . with regards to the corner growth model",

    "the above results deal only with the spatial correlation structure of the limit of the corner growth model  but say nothing about the joint distribution of the fluctuations for two different values of @xmath54 .",
    "for instance , how are the height function fluctuations above the origin at time @xmath307 and @xmath308 asymptotically correlated .",
    "presently , all that is known rigorously of this important question is that if @xmath309 then they two fluctuations converge in probability ( as @xmath198 goes to zero ) @xcite .",
    "one might guess that the limiting space - time process for the corner growth model with @xmath130 is the kpz equation .",
    "this , however , is not true ( as definitively proved by @xcite ) , and the true limiting process has only recently been described in @xcite as the so - called _ kpz renormalization fixed point_.    the kpz equation does , however , arise as the scaling limit of the height function fluctuations of the corner growth model under weakly asymmetric scaling of @xmath77 .",
    "this fact was first observed and rigorously proved ( for certain geometries  not including the wedge ) in 1995 by bertini - giacomin @xcite . such as @xmath310 and",

    ". then bertini - giacomin show that for @xmath39 @xmath317 and @xmath23 evolves according to the kpz equation .",
    "two geometries for which is applies are brownian and flat . for the brownian geometry",

    "there are , however , some very important geometries which are not covered by bertini - giacomin s results  in particular , anything wedge - like .",
    "for instance , the initial condition for kpz in the wedge@xmath161brownian geometry should look like @xmath325 times @xmath326 for @xmath327 and like a brownian motion for @xmath328 .",
    "the problem is , however , that the limit for @xmath327 is infinity .",
    "rather weird initial data , no doubt ?",
    "well things get even weirder for the wedge geometry .",
    "since @xmath154 it follows that @xmath329 should be the kpz initial data . however , this is infinity for all @xmath222 and @xmath126 for @xmath169 .",
    "clearly one would not have much luck solving a stochastic pde with this type of initial data .",
    "the answers to this confusion , however , comes from understanding what it means to solve the kpz equation .",
    "after all , it turns out that as written , this equation is ill - posed due to the non - linearity .",
    "thus the first step towards proving the results of bertini - giacomin , and towards extending them to include wedge - like geometries , is to rigorously define what it means to solve the kpz equation .      at this point",
    "we turn our attention towards making rigorous the connection between the height function fluctuations of the weakly asymmetric corner growth model and the kpz equation . despite its popularity and importance",
    ", there is presently no satisfactory way of making sense of the kpz equation directly .",
    "the reason is that due to the white noise one expects spatial regularity like that of the brownian motion ( in fact for a fixed time the solution should be locally absolutely continuous with respect to brownian motion  like the @xmath227 process ) .",
    "thus the non - linearity ( the square of the first derivative ) is ill - defined .",
    "one might hope that wick ordering of the non - linearity can lead to well defined solutions .",
    "while such an approach allows one to give a definition for solving the kpz equation , it can be shown that the scalings for those solutions are all wrong @xcite .",
    "hence , from the physical perspective we are taking , that is the wrong definition .    as we shall see below ( and later as well in section [ talk3 ] ) the physically relevant way to define the solution to the kpz equation is via the definition which we give momentarily .",

    "in fact , since it is really the she that we will be focusing on , initial data is more naturally thought of as initial data for she .",

    "@xcite provides further evidence by proving that this hopf - cole solution has the scaling properties predicted in @xcite .    while the kpz equation is expected to be the weakly asymmetric scaling limit of a whole class of growth models , the approach used in @xcite only works for the corner growth model .",
    "@xcite study a broad class of such models but can not prove that they converge to the unique hopf - cole solution to kpz .",
    "instead , they define a class of _ energy solutions _ to kpz ( which contains the hopf - cole solution ) and show that along subsequential limits , these models converge to such solutions . however , it is far from clear if this energy condition is a strong enough condition to impose uniqueness .",

    "in section [ talk1 ] we developed the rigorous path between the weakly asymmetric simple exclusion process ( wasep ) and the kpz equation and explained how the initial conditions for the wasep correspond to initial data for the kpz equation ( or really the she ) .",
    "for step initial condition  which corresponds in its scaling limit to the fundamental solution to the she ( i.e. , narrow edge initial data for kpz )  tracy and widom @xcite derived an exact formula for the probability distribution of the location of a single particle in the asep with step initial condition ( see section [ twsec ] for a review of this ) . using this formula and the convergence results detailed already , @xcite provided a rigorous derivation of the exact formula for the one - point probability distribution of the hopf - cole solution to the kpz equation with narrow wedge initial data .",
    "this is stated herein as theorem [ acqmainthm ] .    from the formula in theorem [ acqmainthm ]",
    "it is relatively easy to see that @xmath513 .",
    "however , from the formula it is much harder to see that @xmath514 or that @xmath69 is non - decreasing .",
    "however , we do know that almost surely , for all @xmath39 and @xmath40 , @xmath379 , and hence @xmath515 is a well - defined random variable .",
    "the fact that @xmath69 describes its statistics is due to the convergence result of theorem [ acqbgthm ] which was explained in the previous section .",
    "the formula in theorem [ acqmainthm ] is not the first result of the rigorous asymptotic analysis of tracy and widom s formula and in fact comes after a fair amount of post - processing .",
    "initially one finds the following version of the formula :    @xmath516    where the contour @xmath517 , the contour @xmath518 and the operator @xmath519 are defined below in definition [ thm_definitions ] .",
    "[ thm_definitions ] the contour @xmath517 is defined as @xmath520 navigated starting at @xmath521 and going counter - clockwise .",
    "the contours @xmath518 , @xmath522 are defined as @xmath523 where the constant @xmath524 is defined henceforth as @xmath525 and both contours are navigated from @xmath526 down .",
    "the kernel @xmath519 acts on the function space @xmath527 through its kernel : @xmath528    it is very important to observe that our choice of contours for @xmath529 and @xmath530 ensure that @xmath531 .",
    "this ensures that the integral in @xmath4 above converges for all @xmath529 and @xmath530 .",
    "in fact , the convergence holds as long as we keep @xmath532 in a closed subset of @xmath533 .",
    "the inner integral in ( [ k_csc_definition ] ) can be evaluated and we find that following equivalent expression : @xmath534 this serves as an analytic extension of the first kernel to a larger domain of @xmath535 , @xmath530 and @xmath529 .",
    "we do not , however , make use of this analytic extension , and simply record it as a matter of interest .      due to the process level convergence of wasep to the stochastic heat equation ,",
    "exact information about wasep can be , with care , translated into information about the stochastic heat equation . until recently",
    ", very little exact information was known about asep or wasep .",
    "the work of tracy and widom in the past few years , however , has changed the situation significantly . in order to use their formula",
    "we must rewrite the probability that we are interested in , as the limit of probabilities for the wasep .",
    "define @xmath536 we are interested in understanding the behavior of @xmath537 as @xmath198 goes to zero .",
    "this probability can be translated into a probability for the height function , the current and finally the position of a tagged particle :    since we are dealing with step initial conditions @xmath149 is initially given by @xmath538 .",
    "it is easy to show that because of step initial conditions , the following three events are equivalent : @xmath539 where @xmath540 is the location at time @xmath4 of the particle which started at @xmath541 and where @xmath542 is a random variable which records the number of particles which started to the right of the origin at time 0 and ended to the left or at @xmath6 at time @xmath4 . for this particular initial condition @xmath543 where @xmath544 is the usual time integrated current which measures the signed number of particles which cross the bond @xmath545 up to time @xmath4 ( positive sign for jumps from @xmath7 to @xmath6 and negative for jumps from @xmath6 to @xmath7 ) .",
    "the @xmath73 throughout emphasizes the strength of the asymmetry .",
    "therefore we have the following string of manipulations : @xmath546\\right)=\\\\ \\nonumber & & p\\left(h_{\\gamma}(\\tfrac{t}{\\gamma},x ) \\geq { \\epsilon}^{-1/2}\\left[-s+\\log({\\epsilon}^{-1/2}/2)+\\frac{x^2}{2t}\\right]+\\frac{t}{2}\\right)=\\\\   \\nonumber & & p(\\tilde j_{\\gamma}(\\tfrac{t}{\\gamma},x ) \\geq m ) = p(\\mathbf{x}_{\\gamma}(\\tfrac{t}{\\gamma},m)\\leq x),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath547 is defined as @xmath548,\\ ] ] and @xmath549 $ ] above refers to the integer part .",
    "thus the proof of the exact formula for the solution to the kpz equation amounts to two pieces of information .",

    "and the second was the convergence result of theorem [ acqbgthm ] which as a corollary shows that @xmath553      the starting point for asymptotics is the remarkable formula of tracy and widom first stated in @xcite in the form below , and developed in the three papers @xcite .",
    "we will apply it to the last line of ( [ string_of_eqns ] ) to give us an exact formula for @xmath537 , and then we will take asymptotics as @xmath198 goes to zero .",
    "we consider _ only _ step initial condition asep , where every positive integer lattice site is initial occupied by a particle ( and zero and the negative sites are empty ) . recall that @xmath540 is the location at time @xmath4 of the particle which started at @xmath541 .",

    "we will only include the subscripts on @xmath560 , @xmath106 and @xmath561 when we want to emphasize their dependence on a given variable .",
    "let us briefly remark on the approach tracy and widom used in deriving this formula in @xcite .",
    "it involves solving for an exact formula for the transition probability of a finite number of asep particles .",
    "marginal distribution of a fixed particle are then compactly calculated using certain , so - called magical combinatorial formulas .",
    "the finite number of particles is taken to infinity and in the step initial condition , the marginals take particularly nice forms which can be turned into fredholm determinants and manipulated into the form above . while this approach has been pushed far",
    ", it suffers from its ad hoc nature and , due to the lack of a proper algebraic framework or understanding for this derivation it is very difficult to extend tracy and widom s work to other initial conditions ( aside from the half - bernoulli case @xcite ) as well as to calculations of multipoint distributions .",
    "we will now present a computation deriving the expressions given in theorem [ epsilon_to_zero_theorem ] for @xmath44 . after presenting the derivation",
    ", we will stress that there are a number of very important technical points necessary to overcome to make this computation into rigorous mathematics ",
    "many of which require serious work to resolve . in @xcite a rigorous proof of theorem [ epsilon_to_zero_theorem ] is given in which we deal with all of the possible pitfalls . besides the usual issues of convergence of integrals , trace - class convergence and cutting of contours , the calculation presented here ( similar also to that of sasamoto and spohn ) is plagued by one very significant technical problem regarding the simultaneous deformation of the two contours",
    "along which we are preforming steepest descent .",
    "the fact is that one can not freely deform these contours since doing so would introduce a diverging ( with @xmath198 ) number of poles .",

    "the infinite product is not well behaved along most of this contour , so we will deform the contour to one along which the product is not highly oscillatory .",
    "care must be taken , however , since the fredholm determinant has poles at every @xmath567 .",
    "the deformation must avoid passing through them .",
    "observe now that @xmath568 and that for small @xmath569 , @xmath570 with this in mind define @xmath571 from which we see that if the riemann sum approximation is reasonable then the infinite product converges to @xmath572 .",
    "we make the @xmath573 change of variables and find that the above approximations are reasonable if we consider a @xmath574 contour @xmath575 thus the infinite product goes to @xmath572 .",

    "we determine a candidate for the pointwise limit of the kernel . that the combination of these two pointwise limits gives",
    "the actual limiting formula as @xmath198 goes to zero is , of course , completely unjustified at this point .",

    ", we choose to center in on @xmath587 we can rewrite the argument of the exponential as @xmath588 .",
    "the idea in @xcite for extracting asymptotics of this term is to deform the @xmath102 and @xmath98 contours to lie along curves such that outside the scale @xmath325 around @xmath107 , @xmath589 is large and negative , and @xmath590 is large and positive .",
    "hence we can ignore those parts of the contours .",
    "then , rescaling around @xmath107 to blow up this @xmath325 scale , we obtain the asymptotic exponential term .",
    "this final change of variables then sets the scale at which we should analyze the other two terms in the integrand for the @xmath560 kernel .",

    "we ignore this issue for the calculation , and deal with it carefully in @xcite by using different contours .",

    "we will include this term with the @xmath603 term and take the @xmath604 limit of that product .",
    "as noted before , the term @xmath605 should have been @xmath606 in the taylor expansion above , giving @xmath607 which would appear to blow up as @xmath198 goes to zero .",
    "we now show how the extra @xmath115 in the exponent can be absorbed into the @xmath608 term .",
    "recall @xmath609 if we let @xmath610 , then observe that for @xmath611 , @xmath612 by the choice of @xmath613 , @xmath614 so @xmath615 the discussion on the exponential term indicates that it suffices to understand the behaviour of this function when @xmath102 and @xmath99 are within @xmath325 of @xmath107 .",

    "we shall focus mainly on the point - to - point cdrp in which the underlying path measure is that of a brownian bridge .",
    "we shall see below in section [ approxsec ] that the cdrp is not just the prototype of the @xmath699 polymer universality class , but is also a universal scaling limit in its own right .",
    "moreover , it is related ( via a feynman kac interpretation ) to the she with multiplicative noise and hence to the hopf - cole solution to the kpz equation . given its universality , it is of essential physical and mathematical interest to study the exponents and statistics of the cdrp .",
    "this relies on the recently discovered exact solvability for the cdrp ( as well as a few particular approximations to it )  see section [ solvablepolymers ] .",

    "the problem arises due to the fact that space - time white noise is not a function , but rather a random generalized function .",
    "we now introduce five different schemes through which to define and approximate the free energy of the cdrp .      the correct way to interpret the wick exponential is to taylor expand the wick exponential , time ordering the multiple it integrals and then switching the order of integration with @xmath229 . doing this results in a series of multiple stochastic integrals whose logarithm we define as @xmath234 : @xmath702 where @xmath703 represents the n - step transition probability of a brownian bridge started at 0 at time 0 and ended at @xmath45 and time @xmath54 to go through positions @xmath704 at times @xmath705 for @xmath706 .",
    "the multiple stochastic integrals are those of it .",
    "the series is convergent in @xmath707 .",
    "this follows by applying equation ( [ itoexp ] ) to each term in the chaos series ( since they orthogonal ) and the estimate that @xmath708 the positivity of the right - hand side is not immediately clear but results from the next equivalent formulation , and work of @xcite .    conceptually , the reason for the time ordering is to avoid self - interactions of the space - time white noise . by time ordering it is possible to use the independence of the field to define multiple stochastic integrals and hence to make sense of non - linear functions of the noise .",
    "this type of procedure is often referred to as self - energy renormalization in the physical literature .    in @xcite ,",
    "the chaos series proves useful in calculating short time asymptotics of @xmath234 , however it seems that fixed and large @xmath54 statistics are unattainable directly from the analysis of this series .      defining @xmath709 ( where @xmath359 is the standard gaussian heat kernel and @xmath710",

    "the removal of the quadratic variation can be interpreted as another form of self - energy renormalization .",
    "there are many ways to discretize , or semi - discretize the cdrp .",
    "perhaps the simplest approach is to replace the space - time white noise by an iid field of random variables , and to replace the brownian bridge by a simple symmetric random walk bridge .",
    "specifically let @xmath724 be iid random variables and define the polymer measure on @xmath725 ( the collection of simple symmetric random walk trajectories from 0 at time 0 to @xmath726 at time @xmath120 ) as @xmath727 where the discrete path integral @xmath728 and the partition function is @xmath729 here @xmath226 is called the inverse temperature , and @xmath730 are coupled to @xmath724 so that @xmath731 .",

    "in fact , we have not yet described what the quenched path measure is for the cdrp , though it can be built in terms of coupled solution to the she started and ended at different space - time locations ( see for instance @xcite ) .      as observed by calabrese - le doussal - rosso @xcite and alberts - khanin - quastel @xcite , under diffusive time - space scaling of @xmath738 , @xmath739 and under _ weak noise _ scaling @xmath740 ,",
    "the normalized partition function @xmath741 converges to @xmath742 where @xmath117 solves the multiplicative noise stochastic heat equation with delta initial data .",

    "the essential idea is that for small @xmath226 , @xmath743 . iterating the recursion ( [ tildezrec ] ) and using this we get a finite series in @xmath226 which can be readily identified as a discrete version of the chaos series of section [ chaos_sec ] .",
    "the observation is the basis for the proof .",
    "one should note that it is possible to try to make such a scheme work in the context of the discrete she for the corner growth model , yet the structure of the martingale is much more complex and this approach has not been successfully implemented .",
    "this scheme can be extended to encompass more general noise and underlying random walk measures .",
    "thus , in this weak scaling regime for the noise , the cdrp is a universal scaling object , and its statistics provide the asymptotic statistics for all models which scale to it !",
    "this is very much analogous to the weak asymmetry scaling for the corner growth model under which the kpz equation arises .",
    "the universality of the kpz equation has already been discussed , and thus , owing to the equivalence of the kpz equation to the free energy of the cdrp , one can consider growth models and interacting particle system height functions as approximation schemes for the free energy of the cdrp .",
    "since these models are much further from the cdrp or she , this approximation scheme has only been rigorously implemented for the corner growth model ( or equivalently sep ) in @xcite ( or see theorem [ acqbgthm ] above ) .    from above we know that weak noise discrete directed polymers and the weakly asymmetric corner growth model both scale to the kpz equation .",

    "the free energy for this model is this maximal path integral  known as the last passage time .",
    "if the path measure underlying the polymer is a nearest neighbor random walk , and the noise is formed from iid exponential random variable weights , then there is an exact coupling between lpp and the totally asymmetric corner growth model started with a wedge ( see for example @xcite or @xcite ) .      the six fundamental initial data for the kpz equation ( section [ kpzgrowthregime ] ) correspond with the cdrp with either final or initial potential @xcite and arise from appropriately tuned boundary data for discrete polymers as well ( see @xcite for example ) . by boundary data for a discrete polymer one",
    "means that the @xmath724 for @xmath744 or @xmath745 have different distributions generally with a large mean .",
    "this creates an attractive potential along the boundary of the paths trajectory and hence causes it to remain straight much longer than a standard random walk . critically tuning the type and strength of the boundary potential results in different subclasses of statistics @xcite .    under the feynman kac interpretation for the she with initial data @xmath367 , @xmath746\\ ] ] where @xmath747 represents the expectation over brownian motions which start at @xmath45 at time @xmath126 .",

    "@xcite ( and @xcite ) then took rigorous asymptotics of these formulas to derive the probability distribution for the free energy of the cdrp in the point - to - point ( and half - brownian ) case  or equivalently the kpz equation with narrow - wedge or wedge@xmath161brownian initial data .",
    "this approach was the first taken and has a few advantages . the pre - asymptotic formula ( given by tracy and widom @xcite and restated in theorem [ tw ] ) is already written as a fredholm determinant and has undergone significant manipulations to make it amenable to asymptotics .",

    "moreover , the derivation of the pre - asymptotic formulas is essentially ad - hoc and presently limited ( to the extent needed for asymptotics ) to the two cases mentioned above .",
    "moreover , only one - point distributions have been computed by this method , rendering it presently impossible to find multi - point distributions in this manner for the kpz equation .      the replica approach @xcite uses the polymer formulation of @xmath117 to express the moments of @xmath37 ( with respect to the disorder induced by the white noise potential ) in terms of the solution to a quantum many body system governed by a the lieb - liniger hamiltonian with two - body _ attractive _ delta interaction .",

    "prolhac and spohn @xcite used this approach to derive a conjectural form of the spatial process for the kpz equation in the geometry corresponding to growth in a narrow wedge and confirm that the long time limit of this spatial process is the @xmath778 process . which may not be true at finite @xmath4 but which appears to hold in the long - time limit . ] in @xcite this approach is used to derive a conjectural form for the transition probabilities for the random non - linear semi - group which governs the kpz renormalization fixed point .",
    "very recently @xcite employed the replica trick to derive a conjectural formulas for the crossover one - point distributions for the flat @xmath191 case . also , @xcite used this approach to rederive the formula for the statistics correspond to @xmath779 , which @xcite had rigorously derived a year earlier based on work of @xcite .",
    "the solvability of lpp @xcite relies on the combinatorial robinson - schensted - knuth ( rsk ) correspondence .",
    "rsk maps a matrix of positive weights onto a pair of young tableaux  or equivalently _ gelfand zetlin ( gz ) patterns _  from which one can immediately read off information like the last passage time for the original matrix . when matrix weights are chosen as independent exponential random variables , the resulting measure on gz patterns is given by the schur measure and in this case it",
    "is possible to write exact formulas for the probability distribution for the last passage time ( and many other quantities )  hence the solvability .",
    "last passage percolation represents a zero temperature polymer model , and thus in order to access the statistics of the kpz equation , it is necessary to find solvable finite temperature polymers .",
    "this is accomplished in @xcite for semi - discrete _ brownian polymer _ and @xcite for a particular discrete polymer involving inverse - gamma weights ( which was initially studied in @xcite in which a burkes type theorem was uncovered  first hinting at solvability ) .",
    "in the case of @xcite , the solvability relies on a few facts .",
    "the first is the existence of a finite temperature version of rsk  the _ tropical rsk correspondence _ introduced by a.n .",
    "kirillov @xcite in the context of tropical combinatorics .",
    "the classical rsk correspondence can be encoded as a combinatorial algorithm over the @xmath780 algebra  grsk amounts to formally replacing : @xmath781 and @xmath782 .",
    "the image of a matrix of positive entries under grsk is a triangular array from which one may immediately read off the polymer partition function associated with the original matrix .",
    "this can be done with any weight matrix , however , in the case of inverse - gamma distributed iid weights , a miracle occurs and , due to a certain _ intertwining relation _ and the theory of markov functions @xcite , it is possible to show that a wide variety of projections of the triangular array have the structure of markov chains ( with respect to the filtration formed by their own history ) .",
    "the transition kernels for these chains can be diagonalized in terms of ratios of whittaker functions ( which plays the tropical analogue of schur functions ) and an integrate - out lemma ( the bump - stade identity ) originally developed in the study of automorphic forms enables the exact calculation of the laplace transforms of of polymer s partition function .",
    "the algebraic structure associated with the finite temperature polymer solvability is much better understood than in the context of tracy and widom s work with the asep . therefore",
    ", much more information about the kpz equation should be accessible through this approach .",
    "since the expression naturally ( and rigorously ) derived by this approach is the laplace transforms of the partition function ( which is a positive random variable ) , we can invert and recover expressions the distribution function of the free energy .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        a.  m.  odlyzko , e.  m.  rains on longest increasing subsequences in random permutations . in _",
