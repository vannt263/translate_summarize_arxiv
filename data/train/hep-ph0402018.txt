    "an important clean process allowing us to access off - diagonal ( skewed ) parton distributions , which carry new information on the nucleon s dynamical degrees of freedom , is the deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) @xcite .",
    "this is due to the real photon in the final state being an elementary ( point - like ) particle rather than a bound state like a meson or more complicated configurations .",
    "the skewed parton distributions are generally defined via the fourier transform of matrix elements of renormalized , non - local twist - two operators ( for a pedagogical view , see refs .",
    "these composite operators contain only two elementary fields of the theory , which are placed at different positions becoming then non - local and operating in unequal momentum nucleon states .",
    "hence skewedness takes into account dynamical correlations between partons with different momenta .",
    "the high energy situation at hera gives the important opportunity to constrain them as well as to study the evolution with virtuality of the resulting quark and gluon distributions .",
    "there are several representations for skewed parton distributions @xcite , which can be used to compute the relevant observables in dvcs ( or other exclusive processes ) through a factorization theorem @xcite . they are input in numerical solutions of the renormalization group or evolution equations ( see e.g. @xcite ) , producing very reliable predictions up to nlo level @xcite    on the other hand , the color dipole models have also been successful in describing dvcs observables @xcite .",
    "there , the main degrees of freedom are the color dipoles , which interact with the nucleon target via gluonic exchange .",
    "this interaction is modeled through the dipole - nucleon cross section , which can include qcd dynamical effects given by dglap , bfkl or non - linear high energy evolution equations ( parton saturation ) .",
    "skewedness effects are not considered in the current dipole models and this is one of the goals of the present analysis , making use of a simple phenomenological parametrisation to estimate them . moreover ,",
    "the qcd dglap evolution can be introduced , which improves the data description in the large @xmath0 kinematic region accessible in the recent zeus dvcs measurements @xcite .",
    "this note is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we recall the main formulas for the color dipole formalism applied to dvcs .",
    "for the dipole cross section we have considered the saturation model @xcite , which produces a unified and intuitive description of dis @xcite , diffractive dis @xcite , vector meson production @xcite , drell - yan @xcite and dvcs @xcite . in particular , the restriction to the transverse part of the photon wave function , due to the real final state photon in dvcs , enhances the contribution of larger dipole configurations and therefore the sensitivity to soft content and to the transition between hard / soft regimes .",
    "such a feature provides a particularly relevant test of saturation models .",
    "moreover , the approach includes all twist resummation , in contrast with the leading twist approximations . in the sec . 3",
    ", we discuss the role played by the qcd evolution and skewedness in the high virtuality kinematic region .",
    "we also perform a systematic analysis in order to investigate to what extent the distinct models improve the data description .",
    "these issues have implications in the correct determination of the @xmath1 slope parameter @xmath2 , whose value has never been measured for dvcs .",
    "finally , the last section summarizes our main results .",
    "in the proton rest frame , the dvcs process can be seen as a succession in time of three factorisable subprocesses : i ) the photon fluctuates in a quark - antiquark pair , ii ) this color dipole interacts with the proton target , iii ) the quark pair annihilates in a real photon .",
    "the usual kinematic variables are the @xmath3 c.m.s .",
    "energy squared @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the proton and the photon momenta respectively , the photon virtuality squared @xmath7 and the bjorken scale @xmath8 .",
    "the imaginary part of the dvcs amplitude at zero momentum transfer in the color dipole formalism is expressed in the simple way @xcite , @xmath9\\ , \\varepsilon_1 \\,k_1 ( \\varepsilon_1 \\,{\\mbox{$r$ } } ) \\,\\varepsilon_2 \\,k_1 ( \\varepsilon_2 \\,{\\mbox{$r$ } } ) \\right .",

    "the longitudinal piece does not contribute at @xmath14 .",
    "the relative transverse separation of the pair ( dipole ) is labeled by @xmath15 and @xmath16 , @xmath17 , are the longitudinal momentum fractions of the quark ( antiquark ) .",
    "the auxiliary variables @xmath18 depend on the quark mass , @xmath19 .",
    "the @xmath20 are the mcdonald functions and summation is taken over the quark flavors .",
    "let us summarize the main features and expressions from the saturation model , which will be used here to estimate the dvcs cross section .",
    "a previous analysis compared to h1 data can be found in ref .",
    "the saturation model reproduces color transparency behavior , @xmath21 , for small dipoles , whereas it gives a constant behavior for large ones .",

    "an additional parameter is the effective light quark mass , @xmath27 gev . for the 4-flavor analysis ,",

    "we have fitted it for @xmath37 gev@xmath38 in the form @xmath39 .",
    "it can be verified that when it rises to @xmath40 at high virtualities the contribution of the real part can reach 20% of the total cross section . in the next section",
    "we compute the cross section above using the two versions for the saturation model and contrast them with the recent dvcs zeus data , which includes data points with larger @xmath0 values than the previous h1 data .",
    "moreover , we present a simple way to introduce skewedness effects into the calculation .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     to close this section , as the slope parameter @xmath2 has never been measured for dvcs , we compare the different estimates presented in a systematic way separately for the effect on the @xmath0 dependence and the effect on the overall normalisation . to compare the @xmath0 dependences , we normalize all models to describe the zeus data point at the lowest @xmath0 value , i.e. @xmath41 gev@xmath38 .",
    "further , we plot the ratio of each model to our baseline model sat - mod as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "such a procedure allows a @xmath0 dependence comparison independently of the normalization effect .",
    "these ratios are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4]-a , where the points ( triangles - up ) are the ratio of the zeus data to sat - mod including the error bars for the statistical ( inner ) and sum in quadrature of statistical and systematic ( outer ) uncertainties .    on the other hand , to compare the effect on the normalisation we show the slope value needed to describe the lowest @xmath0 value of the zeus data points @xmath42 gev@xmath38 ) .",
    "they are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4]-b . for completeness",
    ", we also present the measured slope values for vector meson production at that virtuality , both for @xmath43 and @xmath44 mesons as indications of typical values for respectively light and heavy mesons using the simple parametrisation : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the meson mass .    from these comparisons , we conclude that several models can account for the measured @xmath0 dependence ( sat - mod+b(q@xmath38 ) , sat - mod+skew and bgbk , as well as combination of several of those effects ) which are not distinguishable with the present experimental precision .",
    "the difference between the models is much more pronounced in the prediction of the cross section value , or in other terms , in the @xmath2 value needed to describe the integrated cross section over the available @xmath0 range .",
    "if the change in normalisation is small for the inclusion of a @xmath0 dependence in @xmath2 , the effect is of the order of 12% for bgbk with respect to the basic sat - mod and of 40% for the skewedness effect ( skew ) and still larger when the different effect are combined ( 60% for bgbk+skew ) .    in summary",
    ", these issues show clearly the importance of a measurement of the @xmath1 slope parameter @xmath2 .",
    "it has been shown that the dvcs cross section at hera can be described by the simple picture rendered by the color dipoles formalism .",
    "in particular , the saturation model does an excellent job in the current experimental kinematic domain . to achieve a good description of the data up the the highest @xmath0 ,",
    "the original saturation model can be supplemented by qcd evolution , an additional dependence of b on @xmath0 and skewedness effects .",
    "these effects modify in a sensitive way the absolute cross section ( 10 - 60% ) .",
    "measurement of the @xmath1 slope parameter @xmath2 would already allow to discriminate among the different theoretical predictions with an amount of data comparable to the present zeus measurement .",
