    "in @xmath1-dimensional einstein gravity , the static , spherically symmetric , vacuum black hole solution takes the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a mass parameter ( not necessarily equal to the mass ) , @xmath4 is the sign of the cosmological constant @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the line element of an @xmath7-sphere .",
    "it is known that generalizations of the above metric to include the cases with non - spherical , but maximally symmetric sections exist @xcite , i.e. the so - called topological black holes with metrics @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the line element of an @xmath7-dimensional maximally symmetric manifold which can be written explicitly as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the line element of an @xmath13-sphere .",
    "the choices @xmath14 are allowed only for @xmath15 , i.e. the asymptotically ads case .",
    "for all dimensions @xmath16 , the metrics ( [ topobh ] ) are distinct for different values of @xmath17 .",
    "however , for @xmath18 , i.e. the case of btz black holes , there is some ambiguity , because there is no difference ) , the range of the coordinate @xmath19 is different for different choices of @xmath17 in @xmath16 dimensions , one can always make it to stay in the range @xmath20 $ ] in @xmath18 , since in this case the metric becomes translationally invariant along @xmath21 , and we can identify points by taking the quotient of the group of this continuous translation symmetry by one of its discrete subgroup . ] between @xmath22 and @xmath23 and one can absorb @xmath17 into the mass parameter @xmath3 ( as is usually done in the literature , see @xcite for instance ) .    the study of einstein gravity in three spacetime dimensions with cosmological constant was initiated in @xcite . in the absence of matter source , this theory is locally trivial because of the lack of propagating degrees of freedom . in spite of this fact , there can be nontrivial boundary degrees of freedom and these are very interesting thanks to the ads / cft duality : the cft dual of 3d gravity is @xmath24-dimensional , with infinite conformal symmetries making it completely integrable @xcite . in the light that higher dimensional cfts are often mathematically difficult to treat ,",
    "one often take three dimensional gravity as an ideal toy model for learning essential properties of the ads / cft duality . in this",
    "regard , various generalizations of btz black hole spacetime and their holographic properties have been studied extensively ( see @xcite for a very incomplete list of related works ) .    in a recent paper @xcite ,",
    "astorino studied an accelerating variant of the btz black hole .",
    "basically , the spacetime metric obtained in @xcite is a conformally transformed version of the 3d version of the metric ( [ bh ] ) , though the notations used are slightly different .",
    "this accelerating btz spacetime enjoys some feature which are otherwise absent in the non - accelerating version , e.g. the presence of black holes with an angular singularity , allowing extensions to black string of finite length and black ring in 4-dimensions , etc .",
    "some properties of the spacetime are analyzed in detail in @xcite , including horizon structure , temperature and entropy of the black holes in certain range of the parameters . in this paper",
    ", we shall extend the work of @xcite and analyze the accelerating btz spacetime , allowing the acceleration parameter to take a different sign from that in @xcite .",
    "we also prefer to rewrite the metric of in a form which is conformal to the 3d version of ( [ topobh ] ) , taking advantage of the ambiguity in choosing parameters in the 3d case mentioned above .",
    "we begin by writing the spacetime metric in the following form , @xmath25 , \\label{sol}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 where @xmath9 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 is a positive parameter .",
    "clearly , this is an exact solution to the 3d vacuum einstein with cosmological constant @xmath29 , which is given in terms of the parameters as @xmath30 for comparison , we also rewrite the original metric presented in @xcite as follows : @xmath31\\right]\\mathrm{d } t^2\\\\ & \\qquad + \\left[1-m+r^{2}\\left[\\alpha^{2}(m-1)-\\lambda\\right ] \\right]^{-1}\\mathrm{d}r^{2 } + r^{2}\\mathrm{d } \\theta^2 \\bigg\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] there are several differences in our presentation ( [ sol ] ) of the metric from the one given in @xcite .",
    "first , we allow @xmath17 to take 3 possible values @xmath32 rather than fix it to the value 1 .",
    "the reason for this is to stress that for all 3 choices of values of @xmath17 , the @xmath33 limit of the metric are just einstein _ vacua _ , rather than black hole spacetimes @xcite ( for @xmath34 , the corresponding vacua are accelerating vacua , see below . among these",
    ", the @xmath35 vacuum was first found and analyzed in @xcite . ) . besides this purpose",
    ", there is no need to distinguish between @xmath17 and @xmath3 and the combination @xmath36 can be viewed as a single parameter .",
    "second , we made a change @xmath37 .",
    "though this is an identity transform , the use of hyperbolic cosine reflects the actual angular behavior of the conformal factor in the presence of black hole which needs @xmath38 , see below .",
    "the third and perhaps the most significant difference lies in that the parameter @xmath39 in our notation is actually @xmath40 in @xcite . in the analysis of @xcite , an implicit assumption of @xmath41",
    "was used ( i.e. @xmath42 in our notation ) , so we shall be dealing only with the choice @xmath41 .",
    "the coordinate ranges for @xmath43 and @xmath44 are specified as follows : @xmath45 , @xmath46 . as for the coordinate @xmath21 , due to the lack of translational symmetry in @xmath21 in the presence of the conformal factor",
    ", we seem to have no reason to restrict it to be in @xmath47 $ ] .",
    "however , we still wish to interpret the coordinates @xmath48 as being polar , just as in the standard case of btz black hole @xcite , since the latter is the @xmath49 limit of our solution ( [ sol ] ) .",
    "thus we make the choice @xmath50 .",
    "we shall see later that in some cases the range for @xmath21 still need to be adjusted for observers living in one side of the conformal infinity .",
    "the necessity of adjusting the range of @xmath21 in certain cases is one of the major point we would like to make with our choice of @xmath39 , in contrast to the cases analyzed in @xcite .",
    "let us recall the explanation of the conformal factor @xmath51 in the metric ( [ sol ] ) .",
    "consider a static observer @xmath52 in the spacetime , where @xmath53 is the proper time .",
    "it is easy to see that the proper acceleration @xmath54 ( where @xmath55 ) has a norm equal to @xmath56 at @xmath57 , this reduces to @xmath58 this shows that @xmath39 is _ proportional ( but not equal ) to _ the magnitude @xmath59 of the proper acceleration at the origin if @xmath60 .",
    "thus @xmath39 may be called an acceleration parameter .",
    "let us remark that the @xmath43-component of @xmath61 is zero .",
    "because of this , @xmath61 is spacelike and we ought to have @xmath62 in the static region of the spacetime . combining with ( [ an ] ) , we see that @xmath57 is not in the static region if @xmath38 . that the region of spacetime containing the origin @xmath57 is non - static is typical for black holes centered at the origin . for this reason",
    ", we infer that an accelerating black hole can exist only for @xmath38 .",
    "now let us study the horizon structure .",
    "in general , zeros of @xmath63 correspond to horizons . in our case",
    "the zeros are located at @xmath64 this excludes , in particular , the possibility of choosing @xmath65 . for a real zero to exist ,",
    "we need either ( i ) @xmath66 with @xmath67 , or ( ii ) @xmath15 with @xmath38 .",
    "notice that , according to ( [ cc ] ) , the sign of @xmath4 alone can not determine whether the solution is asymptotically de sitter or anti - de sitter .",
    "we can re - express the cosmological constant in terms of @xmath68 as @xmath69 therefore , for @xmath66 , we need @xmath70 to make an ads background , @xmath71 to make a ds background , whereas for @xmath72 , @xmath70 makes a ds background and @xmath71 makes an ads background . for either choices of @xmath4 , @xmath73 corresponds to a flat background .",
    "the choice ( i ) ( i.e @xmath66 , @xmath67 ) corresponds to the case in which static observers are located inside the horizon ( i.e. @xmath74 ) , hence the horizon is more like a cosmological horizon rather than a black hole horizon .",
    "note that , in this case , the hyperbolic cosine function @xmath75 in the conformal factor is actually the usual trigonometric cosine @xmath76 .",
    "since @xmath62 at @xmath57 , the static region in this spacetime is surrounded by an accelerating horizon at @xmath77 which is not a black hole .",
    "the choice ( ii ) ( @xmath15 , @xmath38 ) corresponds to the case in which static observers are located outside the horizon ( i.e. @xmath78 ) , which is the case for a black hole solution .",
    "so we shall be concentrating only on this choice and bear in mind @xmath79 from now on .",
    "notice that for the black hole case with @xmath80 , the cosmological constant @xmath29 needs not to be negative .",
    "this seems to be in contradiction with the known no - go theorem proposed by ida @xcite , which roughly says that the existence of a black hole horizon in @xmath0 dimensions requires a negative cosmological constant .",
    "the reason that our solution evades this no - go theorem is because that the proof of the theorem depends on the assumption that the curve corresponding to the horizon is everywhere smooth , however in our case the horizon contains an angular singularity along @xmath81 , which represents a string or strut acting on the horizon as the source of the acceleration .",
    "similar situations have also been encountered in @xcite .",
    "we will come back to this point later .",
    "there are a number of standard ways to calculate the temperature at the horizon .",
    "for instance , we may take the timelike killing vector @xmath82 to get the surface gravity @xmath83 and then using @xmath84 to evaluate the temperature .",
    "the result reads @xmath85 another simple shortcut to the evaluation of the horizon temperature is to make use of the formula @xmath86 which is valid for any diagonal metric .",
    "now let us look at the function @xmath87 ( eq.([gamma ] ) ) appearing in the conformal factor .",
    "every zero of @xmath87 represents a conformal infinity in the metric ( [ sol ] ) .",
    "if the the acceleration parameter @xmath39 were negative , then @xmath87 will never have a zero for @xmath88 , provided @xmath38 .",
    "so one does not need to worry about the conformal infinities .",
    "this is the case for @xcite . in our case , however , conformal infinity does exist because we are interested in the choice @xmath41 .",
    "moreover , the conformal infinity can intersect with the horizon if @xmath89 , i.e. in the ads or flat cases .",
    "this can be seen from the fact that the equation @xmath90 has two solutions @xmath91 , with @xmath92 if @xmath93 $ ] , then the intersection appears . from the outside static observer s point of view",
    ", this means that the horizon stretches all the way through infinity , i.e. it is noncompact . while evaluating the area of such horizons , one should exclude the part of the @xmath94 hyper surface that is hidden beyond the conformal infinity .",
    "recall that the conformal infinity separates the spacetime into two patches : the @xmath95 patch @xmath96 and the @xmath97 patch @xmath98 .",
    "each observer can perceive only one of the two patches .",
    "therefore , the determination for the correct range for @xmath21 in the @xmath99 cases depends on which patch the observer lives in . for the ads case with @xmath93 $ ] , we need to choose @xmath100 $ ] in the @xmath95 patch and @xmath101 $ ] in the @xmath97 patch . for the ads case with @xmath102 , the horizon will lie completely in the @xmath95 patch and we can still choose @xmath103 $ ] .",
    "the flat case corresponds to @xmath104 , the horizon intersects with the conformal infinity at a single point @xmath105 in the @xmath97 patch , in which case we need to choose @xmath106 $ ] , and there is no horizon in the @xmath95 patch . for the de sitter case",
    ", the zeros of @xmath87 does not intersect with the horizon and we still choose @xmath103 $ ] .",
    "the presence of the conformal infinity makes the analysis of the entropy and angular singularities of the horizon significantly different from the case of @xcite , as is shown below .",
    "first let us consider the entropy of the black hole spacetimes .",
    "we assume that the beckenstein - hawking relation for the entropy still holds .",
    "for the asymptotically ds case ( i.e. @xmath70 ) .",
    "the horizon lies entirely in the @xmath97 patch , and the entropy is @xmath107.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the asymptotically flat case , the horizon hits the conformal infinity at a single point @xmath105 in the @xmath97 patch , whereas there is no horizon in the @xmath95 patch .",
    "therefore , we only need to evaluate the entropy in the @xmath97 patch , yielding a divergent result . the asymptotically ads case must be subdivided into two subcases , i.e. @xmath93 $ ] and @xmath108 . for @xmath93",
    "$ ] , we have @xmath109\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the @xmath95 patch and @xmath110\\right.\\\\ & \\qquad\\left .",
    "- \\mathrm{arctanh}\\left[\\frac{1+\\alpha   r_{h}}{\\sqrt{1-\\alpha^{2 } r_{h}^{2 } } }   \\tanh\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\mathrm{arccosh}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\alpha r_{h}}\\right)\\right )   \\right ]   \\right\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the @xmath97 patch . for @xmath102",
    ", we have @xmath111\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the @xmath95 patch and there is no horizon in the @xmath97 patch .",
    "next comes the analysis on the angular singularities of the horizon .",
    "such singularities exists in all cases mentioned above because of the jump in the derivatives of @xmath87 at @xmath112 , and they provides the source of the acceleration which may be interpreted as a string or strut tied up to the horizon along the @xmath112 direction .",
    "the tension @xmath113 of the string or strut may be calculated using the jump of the exterior curvature at the singularity using the formula @xcite @xmath114_{\\theta=-\\pi}^{\\theta=\\pi}-h_{\\mu\\nu }    [ \\mathcal { k}]_{\\theta=-\\pi}^{\\theta=\\pi}=-h_{\\mu\\nu}\\tau    \\label{jcond}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath115 is the induced metric on the @xmath116 surface , @xmath117 , and @xmath118 is the exterior curvature ( with @xmath119 representing the lie derivative with respect to the normal vector @xmath120 ) . applying ( [ jcond ] ) to the present case , we find that @xmath113 is negative in all cases except in the asymptotically ads case with @xmath108 .",
    "actually , the horizon surface stretches to the direction @xmath81 in the @xmath121 patch in all cases except the exceptional case mentioned above in which it goes to the @xmath95 patch .",
    "the explicit value of @xmath113 is @xmath122 if the horizon reaches @xmath112 in the @xmath97 patch , or @xmath123 if the horizon reaches @xmath112 in the @xmath95 patch .",
    "the tension depends on the difference @xmath36 and it vanishes at @xmath124 or @xmath125 . besides the vanishing points , @xmath126 corresponds to a pushing strut and @xmath127 corresponds to a pulling string .",
    "let us stress that , while doing the above analysis , we have not considered the possibility of extending the spacetime to the @xmath128 regime . if the latter regime were also included , then we will have an extra horizon with @xmath129 as well as an extra conformal infinity at @xmath128 ( if @xmath39 were chosen negative ) . in any case the positive conformal infinity at @xmath88 and the negative conformal infinity at @xmath128 can not be both present for a fixed @xmath39 .",
    "note that this last statement applies only to the black hole case ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "if we were considering the bubble spacetime with @xmath67 , then the two conformal infinities will be both present for any given @xmath39 .",
    "the mass or energy of the black hole solution is difficult to determine , because there is no known way to determine the mass of asymptotically non - flat , accelerating black holes .",
    "nevertheless , since at @xmath33 , the metric ( [ sol ] ) becomes the accelerating vacua described recently by us @xcite , we see that the mass of the black hole has to be proportional to @xmath3 by dimensional analysis can actually be written as @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the newton constant and @xmath132 has the dimension of mass .",
    "here we use the dimensionless mass parameter @xmath3 to make the notation simpler . ] .",
    "one may , of course , assume that the first law of black hole thermodynamics holds in this situation and use that to calculate the mass of the black hole , as did in @xcite .",
    "however , we prefer not to proceed in that direction due to the following reasons .",
    "one the one hand , the usual logic on the black hole thermodynamics is that the correctness of the first law of black hole physics ought to be checked after each observable of the black hole spacetime has been evaluated by other means , if gravity and black hole thermodynamic were considered as independent of each other . on the other hand , for spacetimes with non - vanishing cosmological constant ( which is the case of our main interests ) , the presentation of the first law contains some ambiguity even one is sure about its correctness .",
    "one may , for instance , consider the cosmological constant as being the pressure of some liquid component and then write the first law in a form like @xmath133 ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , rather than simply @xmath134 . in view of this",
    ", the first law alone is still insufficient to determine the mass of the black hole , even if we accept the correctness of the first law by _",
    "ad hoc _ assumption .",
    "unlike black hole solutions in dimensions @xmath16 , the 3d black holes enjoys a very particular property , i.e. the riemann curvature can be written as @xmath135 this allows us to embed some coordinate patch of the black hole spacetime into appropriate 4d flat spacetime and study it from an extrinsic geometric point of view .    as in the previous section , we shall be working only with the choice ( ii ) , i.e. @xmath15 , @xmath38 , with the presence of black hole horizon in our solution .",
    "we shall present the embedding relations according to different asymptotics of the solution .",
    "first we consider the asymptotically de sitter case ( @xmath136 ) . in this case",
    ", the spacetime can be embedded in a 4d minkowski spacetime @xmath137 as a hyperboloid , @xmath138 where @xmath139 the coordinate transformation leading to our solution ( [ sol ] ) is given as @xmath140 where @xmath141 is given in ( [ gamma ] ) .",
    "notice that at @xmath124 , the embedding breaks down , although the original metric ( [ sol ] ) is well defined in that case , which corresponds to an accelerating ads vacuum .",
    "meanwhile , the embedding equations hold only for @xmath142 , i.e. the static region of outside the horizon and the horizon itself , thus do not cover the whole spacetime .",
    "the case of ads black hole spacetime ( @xmath71 ) can be embedded in a 4d pseudo minkowski spacetime @xmath143 as a hyperboloid , @xmath144 the embedding relations are the same as ( [ emb1])-([emb4 ] ) , but with @xmath53 replaced by @xmath145    the flat case , @xmath73 , is even more simpler : it can be seen that the asymptotically flat black hole metric @xmath146\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] can be obtained from the 3d minkowski metric @xmath147 thanks to the coordinate transformation @xmath148 let us stress once again that this extrinsic geometric description covers only a small portion of the black hole spacetime ( @xmath149 ) .",
    "it helps us to understand the flat nature of the spacetime , but it does nt provides us with a global view of the spacetime .    the accelerating bubble spacetime corresponding to @xmath66 and @xmath67 in ( [ sol ] ) can also be embedded into appropriate 4d target spacetimes following a similar spirit .",
    "the extrinsic geometric description of the metric can only describe a small coordinate patch of the spacetime which lies outside the horizon . to fully understand the structure of the spacetime",
    ", we identify its causal structure . as in the previous section ,",
    "we shall be working only with the choice @xmath80 , i.e. black hole cases .    as usual",
    ", we introduce the eddington - finkelstein coordinates , @xmath150 where the tortoise coordinate @xmath151 is defined as @xmath152 and both @xmath153 and @xmath154 belong to the range @xmath155 . in this coordinate the metric becomes @xmath156 , \\label{metric3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath157 .",

    "the unexpected rich structure in the causal diagrams makes the spacetime more interesting than the static btz black hole .    in closing , let us mention that the accelerating btz spacetime discussed in this article can be viewed as the 3d analogue of the c - metric in 4-dimensions .",
