    "in this paper we study some intriguing connections between basic objects from commutative algebra and combinatorics . for @xmath10 an arbitrary field we let @xmath11 $ ] denote the polynomial ring in @xmath1 variables .",
    "we let @xmath0 denote the edge ideal of the complement of the @xmath1-cycle @xmath12 . by definition",
    ", @xmath0 is the ideal generated by the degree 2 monomials corresponding to the diagonals of @xmath12 .",
    "one can also realize @xmath0 as the stanley - reisner ideal of the cycle @xmath12 ( now thought of as a one - dimensional simplicial complex ) .",
    "the ideals @xmath0 are of course very simple algebraic objects and their homological properties are well - understood .",
    "one can verify that @xmath13 is a gorenstein ring , the dimension of @xmath13 is 2 , and ( hence ) the projective dimension of @xmath13 is @xmath14 .",
    "in fact a minimal free resolution can be described explicitly , and cellular realizations have been provided by biermann @xcite and more recently by sturgeon @xcite .",
    "we wish to further investigate the combinatorics involved in the resolutions of @xmath0 .",
    "our original interest in cellular resolutions of @xmath0 came from the fact that the ideal @xmath0 has an ` almost linear ' resolution , in the sense that the nonzero entries in the differentials of its minimal resolution are linear forms from @xmath15 , _ except _ at the last syzygy where the nonzero entries are all degree 2 .",
    "recent work in combinatorial commutative algebra has seen considerable interest in cellular resolutions of monomial and binomial ideals ( see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , but in almost all cases the ideals under consideration have linear resolutions . here",
    "we seek to extend some of these constructions . in the construction of any cellular resolution",
    ", one must construct a @xmath16-complex with faces labeled by monomials that generate the ideal . in the case of @xmath0",
    "there is a well known geometric object whose vertices are labeled by the diagonals of an @xmath1-gon , namely the ( simplicial ) associahedron @xmath3 . by definition , @xmath3 is the simplicial complex with vertex set given by diagonals of an @xmath1-gon , with faces given by collections of diagonals that are non - crossing .",
    "the facets of @xmath3 are triangulations of the @xmath1-gon , of which there are a catalan number many .",
    "it is well known that @xmath3 is spherical , and in fact can be realized as the boundary of a convex polytope .",
    "in addition there is a natural way to associate a monomial to each face of @xmath3 , and in the first part of the paper we show that this labeled facial structure of @xmath3 ( considered as a polytope with a single interior cell ) encodes the syzygies of @xmath0 .    with its natural monomial labeling",
    ", the complex @xmath3 supports a free resolution of the ideal @xmath0 .",
    "the resolution of @xmath0 supported on the associahedron @xmath3 is not minimal for @xmath17 , and in particular in this case we have faces @xmath18 with the same monomial labeling .",
    "the @xmath5-vector of @xmath3 is completely understood ( a closed form can be written down ) , and in fact the number of @xmath8-dimensional faces of @xmath3 is equal to the number of standard young tableaux of shape @xmath9 ; a bijective proof of this was first provided by stanley @xcite .    since a resolution of @xmath0 is supported on @xmath3 we know that the @xmath5-vector of @xmath3 provides an upper bound on the betti numbers @xmath19 , with equality in the case of @xmath20 . in the second part of the paper we show that the betti numbers @xmath21 of @xmath13 are given by standard young tableaux on a set of subpartitions involved in the stanley bijection .",
    "the total betti numbers @xmath21 of the module @xmath13 are given by the number of standard young tableaux of shape @xmath7 .",
    "this bijection along with an application of the hook formula leads to a closed form expression for the betti numbers of @xmath13 .",
    "in addition , the fact that the partition @xmath7 is conjugate to @xmath22 provides a nice combinatorial interpretation of the palindromic property @xmath23 for the betti numbers of the gorenstein ring @xmath13 .",
    "the fact that we can ( in theory ) identify the betti numbers of @xmath13 with certain faces of @xmath3 suggests that it may be possible to collapse away faces of @xmath3 to obtain a minimal resolution of @xmath0 , employing an algebraic version of morse theory due to batzies and welker ( @xcite ) .",
    "indeed certain geometric properties of any subdivision of an @xmath1-gon ( along with the almost linearity of @xmath0 ) imply that certain faces must be matched away .",
    "for @xmath24 we are able to write down a morse matching involving the edges and 2-faces of @xmath3 such that the number of unmatched ( critical ) cells is precisely @xmath25 ( corresponding to the first syzygy module of @xmath13 ) , see proposition [ prop : edges ] .",
    "this leads to minimal resolutions of @xmath0 for the cases @xmath26 .",
    "in addition , our identification of both the betti numbers of @xmath13 and the faces of @xmath3 with standard young tableaux leads us to consider a partial matching on the set of associahedron tableaux such that the unmatched elements correspond to the betti numbers .",
    "the hope would be to import a poset structure from the face poset of @xmath3 to extend this matching to a morse matching .",
    "the trouble with this last step is that the stanley bijection does not give us an explicit labeling of the faces of @xmath3 by standard young tableaux ; there are choices involved and the bijection itself is recursively defined .",
    "however , we can define a very simple partial matching on the set of standard young tableaux of shape @xmath9 such that the unmatched elements can naturally be thought of as standard young tableaux of shape @xmath7 ( by deleting the largest entries ) ; see proposition [ prop : matching ] .",
    "this suggests a poset structure on the set of standard young tableax that extends this covering relation .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin in section [ sec : algebra ] with some basics regarding the commutative algebra involved in our study . in section [ sec : ass ] we discuss associahedra and their role in resolutions of @xmath0 .",
    "we turn to standard young tableaux in section [ sec : tableaux ] and here establish our results regarding the betti numbers of @xmath13 . in section [ sec : matching ] we discuss our applications of discrete morse theory and related matchings of stand young tableaux .",
    "we end with some open questions .",
    "as above we let @xmath0 denote the stanley - reisner ideal of the @xmath1-cycle , by definition the ideal in @xmath11 $ ] generated by degree 2 monomials corresponding to the diagonals .",
    "we are interested in combinatorial interpretations of certain homological invariants of @xmath0 , and in particular the combinatorial structure of its minimal free resolution .",
    "recall that a _ free resolution _ of an @xmath15-module @xmath27 is an exact sequence of @xmath15-modules @xmath28 where each @xmath29 is free and the differential maps are graded .",
    "the resolution is _ minimal _ if each of the @xmath30 are minimum among all resolutions , in which case the @xmath30 are called the ( graded ) betti numbers of @xmath27 .",
    "also in this case the number @xmath31 ( length of the minimal resolution ) is called the _ projective dimension _ of @xmath27",
    ".    our main tool in calculating betti numbers will be hochster s formula ( see for example @xcite ) , which gives a formula for the betti numbers of the stanley - reisner ring @xmath32 associated to a simplicial complex @xmath33 .

    "of @xmath27 is a cw - complex @xmath39 with a monomial labeling of its faces , such that the algebraic chain complex computing the cellular homology of @xmath39 ` supports ' a resolution of @xmath27 .",
    "we refer to section [ sec : ass ] for details and more precise definitions .",
    "we next collect some easy observations regarding the betti numbers of @xmath0 . since @xmath0 is the stanley - reisner ideal of a triangulated 1-dimensional sphere , we see that @xmath13 is gorenstein and has ( krull ) dimension 2 .",
    "the auslander - buchsbaum formula then implies that the projective dimension of @xmath13 is @xmath14 , which says that @xmath40 whenever @xmath41 .",
    "an easy application of hochster s formula also implies that a minimal resolution of @xmath0 is linear until the last nonzero term , by which we mean if @xmath42 , then @xmath40 for all @xmath43 .",
    "also , we have @xmath44 and @xmath45 for @xmath46 . in this sense the ideals @xmath0 have an ` almost linear ' resolution , as mentioned in the introduction .",
    "* convention * : since for any @xmath47 we have @xmath48 for at most one value of @xmath49 , we we will ( without loss of generality ) sometimes drop the @xmath49 and use @xmath50 to denote the betti numbers of @xmath0 .",
    "for each @xmath1 , we let @xmath3 denote the ( dual ) _ associahedron _ , the @xmath51-dimensional simplicial complex whose vertices are given by diagonals of a labeled regular @xmath1-gon , with facets given by triangulations ( collections of diagonals that do not intersect in their interior ) .",
    "it is well known that @xmath3 is homeomorphic to a sphere and in fact is polytopal , and several embeddings ( most often of the dual simple polytope ) are described throughout the literature ( see @xcite for a good account of the history ) . from here on we will use @xmath3 to denote the @xmath2-dimensional simplicial polytope ( i.e. , including the interior ) .",
    "we wish to describe a monomial labeling of the faces of @xmath3 .",
    "recall that each vertex of @xmath3 corresponds to some diagonal @xmath52 of an @xmath1-gon , so we simply label that vertex with the monomial @xmath53 .",
    "we label the higher - dimensional faces of @xmath3 with the least common multiple of the vertices contained in that face .",
    "we wish to show that , with this simple labeling , the associahedron @xmath3 supports a resolution of @xmath0 .",
    "let us first clarify our terms . to simplify notation",
    "we will associate to any monomial @xmath54 the vector @xmath55 and will freely move between notations .",
    "we define a _ labeled polyhedral complex _ to be a polyhedral complex @xmath56 together with an assignment @xmath57 to each face @xmath58 such that for all @xmath59 we have @xmath60 if @xmath39 is a labeled polyhedral complex we can consider the ideal @xmath61 $ ] generated by the monomials corresponding to its vertices ( as usual we identify an element @xmath62 as the exponent vector of a monomial ) .",
    "the topological space underlying @xmath39 ( with a chosen orientation ) has an associated chain complex @xmath63 of @xmath64-vector spaces that computes cellular homology .",
    "since @xmath39 has monomial labels on each of its cells , we can homogenize the differentials with respect to this basis and in this way @xmath63 becomes a complex of free modules over the polynomial ring @xmath11 $ ] .",
    "we say that the polyhedral complex @xmath39 _ supports _ a resolution of the ideal @xmath27 if @xmath63 is in fact a graded free resolution of @xmath27 . for more details and examples of cellular resolutions",

    "once we designate the middle vertex in this path ( of which there are @xmath1 choices ) we have @xmath186 choices for the remaining two vertices .",
    "next we claim that the the number of subproper subdivisions of an @xmath1-gon with @xmath175 diagonals ( necessarily forming an inscribed triangle ) is given by @xmath187 . to see this , we first count inscribed triangles with ordered vertex set @xmath188 . we are free to choose the first vertex @xmath189 from among the @xmath1 nodes of the cycle . for the second vertex we have two cases .",
    "if we choose @xmath190 from among the two vertices that are distance 2 from @xmath189 , we are left with @xmath191 choices for @xmath192 .",
    "if we choose @xmath190 from among the vertices more than distance 2 from @xmath189 ( of which there are @xmath193 choices ) , we are then left with @xmath194 choices for @xmath192 . in total",
    "there are @xmath195 inscribed triangles with the ordered vertex set . dividing out by @xmath196 to forget the ordering gives us the desired count . as described above , we match each of the @xmath24 superproper subdivisions with a @xmath175 proper subdivision , and we match each of the @xmath175 subproper subdivisions with a @xmath24 proper subdivision . hence after matching the number of critical edges is given by @xmath197 which is precisely @xmath180 ( see remark [ rem : bettiexplicit ] ) .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "hence our simple matching leaves precisely the number of critical 1-cells that we require .",
    "the rank of the first free module in the resulting cellular resolution will be equal to the rank of the first syzygy module of @xmath13 .    for @xmath198",
    "this matching in fact leads to a minimal resolution of @xmath199 . in this case",
    "we have three superproper subdivisions with @xmath24 ( namely @xmath200 , @xmath201 , and @xmath202 ) , and two subproper subdivisions with @xmath175 ( namely @xmath203 and @xmath204 ) .",
    "we remark that the procedure described above can be extended to the case @xmath205 .",
    "we leave the details to the reader but point out that in this case we have :    * @xmath206 superproper subdivisions with @xmath24 ( pairs of disjoint diagonals ) , corresponding to 14 edges of @xmath207 that we match with @xmath208-faces , * @xmath209 subproper subdivisions with @xmath210 ( inscribed triangles in a @xmath209-gon ) , corresponding to seven @xmath208-faces that each get matched with an edge , * @xmath206 superproper subdivisions with @xmath175 ( forests consisting of three edges and two components ) , corresponding to seven @xmath208-faces that get matched to a @xmath211-face , * @xmath206 subproper subdivisions with @xmath212 ( inscribed triangles with a pendant edge ) , corresponding to fourteen @xmath211-faces that get matched down to a @xmath208-face .",
    "the resulting cw - complex has @xmath213 edges , @xmath214 two - dimensional faces , and @xmath215 three - dimensional faces , as desired .",
    "unfortunately we do not know how to extend this matching procedure in general ; see the next section for some comments regarding this .",
    "recall that the faces of the associahedron @xmath3 are counted by standard young tableaux of certain shapes , while the betti numbers of @xmath0 are counted by standard young tableaux of certain subshapes .",
    "again motivated by discrete morse theory this leads to ask whether we can find a matching on the set of associahedron tableaux such that the unmatched elements correspond to the betti numbers of @xmath0 .",
    "this matching should have the property that two matched tableaux differ in cardinality by one .",
    "let us emphasize that since we do not have a poset structure on these elements we are not at this pointing searching for a _ _ m__orse matching .",
    "let us first fix some notation .    for fixed @xmath71 and @xmath117",
    ", we call the collection of standard young tableaux of shape @xmath216 the _ associahedron tableaux _ ( denoted by @xmath217 ) , and the standard young tableaux of shape @xmath7 the _ syzygy tableaux _ ( denoted by @xmath218 ) .",
    "let @xmath219 and @xmath220 .    note that an element of @xmath221 has @xmath222 boxes , whereas an element of @xmath223 has @xmath1 boxes .",
    "if @xmath224 is an associahedron tableux with largest entries in the second row in the positions @xmath225 then it naturally becomes a syzygy tableau by just removing those boxes .",
    "in particular we say that these particular associahedron tableau _ restrict _ to syzygy tableaux , and in this way we have a natural inclusion @xmath226 .",
    "the associahedron tableau on the left restricts to a syzygy tableau , whereas the associahedron tableau on the right does not . here",
    "@xmath205 and @xmath175 .",
    "@xmath227    we next describe an involution on the set @xmath228 such that the fixed elements are precisely the elements that restrict to @xmath229 . if @xmath230 is a standard young tableau we use @xmath231 to denote the number of boxes in the underlying partition .",
    "[ prop : matching ] there exists an involution @xmath73 on the set @xmath228 such that the fixed point set of @xmath73 is precisely the set of tableaux in @xmath228 that restrict to @xmath229 .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath232 such that @xmath233 , we have @xmath234 .",
    "suppose @xmath224 is an associahedron tableau .",
    "if @xmath230 restricts to a syzygy tableau we set @xmath235 . otherwise some element of @xmath236 is not in the second row of @xmath230 ; let @xmath80 be the largest element with this property",
    ". then @xmath80 must be the last element of the first row , or else the bottom element in the first column .    in the latter case (",
    "@xmath80 is the bottom most element of first column ) we bring that element @xmath80 to the first row , and add the element @xmath237 to the end of the second row .",
    "this defines @xmath238 . in the former case",
    "( @xmath80 is the last element of the first row ) we obtain @xmath238 by bringing that element down to the bottom of the first column and deleting the last element of the second row ( which must be @xmath222 ) .",
    "it is clear that @xmath239 .",
    "[ ex : matching ] an example of the involution matching an associahedron tableau of shape @xmath240 with one of shape @xmath241 is given by the following .",
    "we end with a number of questions that arise from our study . as we have seen in section [ sec : tableaux ] , the number @xmath95 of dissections of an @xmath1-gon using @xmath47 ( non - crossing ) diagonals is well understood , and is given by the number of standard young tableaux of shape @xmath243 . in the context of enumerating the betti numbers of the ideal @xmath0 we were interested in subdivisions that involved a fixed number of vertices .",
    "define @xmath244 to be the number of ways to choose @xmath47 non - crossing diagonals in a convex @xmath1-gon such that the set of endpoints consists of precisely @xmath49 vertices of the @xmath1-gon .",
    "a related question would be to consider those subdivisions for which the collection of diagonals forms a ( connected ) tree , since this is likely the more relevant property in the context of syzygies .",
    "for @xmath26 it so happens that the proper subdivisions correspond to those collections of diagonals that form a tree .",
    "however , for @xmath246 there exist proper subdivisions that are not trees : for example if @xmath247 we can take 3 diagonals to form a triangle with vertices @xmath248 along with one disconnected diagonal @xmath249 , in total using 5 vertices of the @xmath250-gon .      in our quest for a morse matching on the monomial labeled face poset of the associahedron @xmath3 we were unable to employ stanley s bijection between faces of @xmath3 and standard young tableaux .",
    "as mentioned above , the difficulty arises as the bijection given in @xcite is recursively defined and involves certain choices .",
    "however , the fact that the face poset of @xmath3 is labeled by standard young tableaux suggests that there might be a meaningful poset structure on the set of all standard young tableaux ( or at least the set of associahedron tableaux ) .",
    "the hope would be that this poset structure extends the partial order given by the involution on @xmath228 described in the proof of proposition [ prop : matching ] .",
    "hence the poset should be graded by the number of boxes in the underlying partition , but will _ not _ restrict to young s lattice if one forgets the fillings .",
    "we refer to example [ ex : matching ] for a example of a cover relation between two standard young tableaux such that the underlying partitions are not related in young s lattice .      finally , we see in figure [ fig : matching ] that a minimal resolution of @xmath199 is supported on a 3-dimensional polytope . as we mentioned the construction",
    "there was a bit ad hoc but it does lead us to following :          we thank ken baker for his assistance with the figures , and alex engstrm , jakob jonsson , and michelle wachs for helpful conversations .",
