    "galaxy groups are believed to play a key role in the formation and evolution of structure in the universe as , within a hierarchical framework , they span the regime between individual galaxies and massive clusters .",
    "they are also more varied in their properties than galaxy clusters , as seen when various scaling relations are compared with those of galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "for instance , the relation between the luminosity and temperature of the x - ray emitting hot intergalactic medium ( the @xmath0 relation ) has a larger scatter and a different slope for groups , when compared to similar properties of clusters .",
    "various feedback mechanisms are often invoked to explain these differences .",
    "in addition , due to their lower velocity dispersion , groups are rapidly evolving systems , and galaxy mergers within groups can have a more significant effect on these relations than in clusters . in principle , the presence of cool cores and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , as well as the star formation history , are all affected by major interactions in the heart of a group or cluster .",
    "it would therefore be useful to find a class of groups or clusters with no major mergers in their recent history , to provide a baseline for the evolution of a passive system , with no major disruption .",
    "fossil groups are good candidates for such a class of objects .",
    "they are distinguished by a large gap between the brightest galaxy and the fainter members , with an under - abundance of @xmath1 galaxies .",
    "@xcite suggest that , for an x - ray detected group , the merging timescale for the most luminous group members ( @xmath2 ) is of order of a few tenths of an hubble time , in agreement with the numerical simulations .",
    "a single giant elliptical galaxy can form as a result of multiple mergers within a few gyr @xcite .",
    "thus , it is likely that one can find merged groups in the form of an isolated giant elliptical galaxy with an extended halo of hot gas , since the timescale for gas infall is longer than that on which galaxies merge @xcite . in such systems , the brighter galaxies , which have a relatively shorter merging timescale ,",
    "are expected to merge earlier leaving the fainter end of the luminosity function intact @xcite .    following the discovery of a fossil group having the above characteristics from rosat observations @xcite ,",
    "more fossil systems have been identified @xcite .",
    "they are generally based on the definition of fossil groups from @xcite , i.e. groups with a minimum x - ray luminosity of @xmath3erg s@xmath4 , as well as minimum magnitude difference of two between the first and second ranked galaxies , within half the projected radius that encloses an overdensity of 200 times the mean density of the universe ( @xmath5 ) . for an nfw profile @xcite ,",
    "this is roughly equivalent to @xmath6 , the radius enclosing an overdensity of 500 times the mean ( for nfw haloes of the appropriate concentration , @xmath7 ) .",
    "a few of these fossil groups have been the subject of detailed investigations @xcite .",
    "while most previous studies have focused on x - ray properties of fossils , there is also emerging evidence that the galaxy properties in fossils are different from those in non - fossils @xcite .",
    "for instance the isophotal shapes of the central fossil galaxies appear to be non - boxy , suggesting that they may have formed in gas rich mergers .",
    "various observational and theoretical studies have suggested a significant fraction of galaxy groups to be fossils @xcite , though often the criteria used to define fossils in theoretical work are not easy to relate to observational studies .",
    "fossils may represent extreme examples of a continuum of group properties  they are consistently found to be outliers in the usual scaling relations involving optical , x - ray and dynamical properties @xcite . while fossils fall on the l - t relation of non - fossil groups and clusters , they appear to be both hotter and more x - ray luminous than non - fossils of the same mass .",
    "cooler fossil groups also show lower entropy than their non - fossil counterparts . according to @xcite ,",
    "the haloes of fossil groups appear to be more concentrated than those of non - fossil systems , for a given mass , which suggests that fossils have an early formation epoch . as such",
    ", we have much to learn from them , and the investigation of objects with similar properties in cosmological simulations can provide important insights into the physical processes that underly the scaling relations .",
    "it can also reveal limitations in the numerical simulations , related to the treatment of physical effects like pre - heating , feedback and merging , which are difficult to model .",
    "it is thus important to study the formation and evolution of these systems in the cosmological n - body simulations which have become essential tools for studying formation of large scale structure in the universe .    in this paper",
    "we use the millennium simulation @xcite together with the semi - analytic models @xcite of galaxy formation within dark matter haloes and the millennium gas simulation @xcite , to identify fossil groups , study their properties in the simulations and make a comparison to the observations .",
    "we begin with a brief discussion in  2 of the millennium simulation , and the implemented semi - analytic galaxy catalogues and gas simulations . in ",
    "3 we discuss our method of identifying _ optical _ and _ x - ray _ fossil groups from these catalogues . in  4 , we discuss the various properties of these fossil groups , their abundance in the local universe and the evolution of simulated x - ray fossils with time .",
    "finally , in  5 , we summarize the implications of our results in terms of the evolution of fossil groups in the context of multiwavelength observations . throughout the paper",
    "we adopt @xmath8 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 for the hubble constant .",
    "in order to extract fossil groups in the millennium simulation , using observational selection criteria , we require a simulation suite that includes the baryonic physics of hot gas and galaxies , as well as a high resolution dark matter framework and a sufficient spatial volume to limit the effects of cosmic variance . for this study",
    "we use the dark matter millennium simulation @xcite , a 10-billion particle model of a comoving volume of side 500@xmath9 mpc , on top of which a publicly available semi - analytic galaxy model @xcite has been constructed .",
    "for the hot gas we have repeated the millennium simulation with a lower resolution simulation including gas physics utilising the same volume , phases and amplitudes as the original dark - matter - only model .",
    "this run accurately reproduces the structural framework of the millennium simulation @xcite .",
    "below we summarize the main characteristics of the above simulations .",
    "the millennium simulation is based on a cold dark matter cosmological model of structure formation , with a dark energy field @xmath10 .",
    "the basic assumptions are those of an inflationary universe , dominated by dark matter particles , leading to a bottom - up hierarchy of structure formation , via collapsing and merging of small dense haloes at high redshifts , into the large virialised systems such as groups and clusters that contain the galaxies that we observe today .",
    "the simulation was performed using the publicly available parallel treepm code gadget2 @xcite , achieving a 3d dynamic range of @xmath11 by evolving 2160@xmath12 particles of individual mass @xmath13 m@xmath14 , within a co - moving periodic box of side 500@xmath9 mpc , and employing a gravitational softening of 5@xmath9 kpc , from redshift @xmath15 to the present day .",
    "the cosmological parameters for the millennium simulation were : @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , where the hubble constant is characterised as @xmath18 these cosmological parameters are consistent with recent combined analysis from _ wmap _ data @xcite and the 2df galaxy redshift survey @xcite , although the value for @xmath19 is a little higher than would perhaps have been desirable in retrospect .",
    "the derived dark matter halo catalogues include haloes down to a resolution limit of 20 particles , which yields a minimum halo mass of 1.72@xmath20 m@xmath14 .",
    "haloes in the simulation are found using a friends - of - friends ( fof ) group finder , tuned to extract haloes with overdensities of at least 200 relative to the critical density . within a fof halo , substructures or subhaloes",
    "are identified using the subfind algorithm developed by @xcite , and the treatment of the orbital decay of satellites is described in the next section .    during the millennium simulation ,",
    "64 time - slices of the locations and velocities of all the particles were stored , spread approximately logarithmically in time between @xmath15 and @xmath21 . from these time - slices ,",
    "merger trees are built by combining the tables of all haloes found at any given output time , a process which enables us to trace the growth of haloes and their subhaloes through time within the simulation .      using the dark matter haloes of the @xcite simulation , @xcite",
    "have simulated the growth of galaxies , and their central supermassive black holes , by self - consistently implementing semi - analytic models of galaxies on the outputs of the millennium simulation .",
    "the semi - analytic catalogue contains 9 million galaxies at @xmath21 down to a limiting absolute magnitude of @xmath22 , observed in @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 filters .",
    "the models focus on the growth of black holes and agns as feedback sources .",
    "the inclusion of agn feedback in the semi - analytic model ( which allows the cooling flow to be suppressed in massive haloes that undergo quasi - static cooling ) and its good agreement with the observed galaxy luminosity function , colour distribution and the clustering properties of galaxies , make this catalogue well - matched and suitable for our study of fossil systems .    in the semi - analytic formulation ,",
    "galaxies initially form within small dark matter haloes .",
    "as the simulation evolves , such a halo may fall into a larger halo .",
    "the semi - analytic galaxy within this halo then becomes a satellite galaxy within the main halo and follows the track of its original dark matter halo ( now a subhalo ) until the mass of the subhalo drops below 1.72@xmath20 m@xmath14 , which corresponds to a 20-particle limit in the millennium simulation . at this point",
    "the galaxy is assumed to spiral into the centre , on some fraction of the dynamical friction timescale , where it merges with the central galaxy of the larger halo @xcite .      the millennium gas simulations are a suite of hydrodynamical models , utilising the same volume , and values of initial perturbation amplitudes and phases as the parent dark - matter - only millennium simulation .",
    "each of the three models completed to date contains additional baryonic physics : the first does not follow the effects of radiative cooling and so overpredicts the luminosities of group - scale objects significantly .",
    "the second includes a simple preheating scheme that is tuned to match the observed x - ray properties of clusters at the present day and the third includes a simple feedback model that matches the observed properties of clusters today , as well as having some chance of following the time evolution .",
    "we have used the second of these models in this work , as we only utilise the hydrodynamical properties of the groups at @xmath21 , where the observational and simulation results are well matched .",
    "each of the millennium gas simulations consists of @xmath28 particles of each species , resulting in a dark matter mass of @xmath29 m@xmath30 per particle and a gas mass of @xmath31 m@xmath30 per particle .",
    "the millennium simulation has roughly 20 times better mass resolution than this and so some perturbation of the dark matter halo locations is to be expected . in practice",
    "the position and mass of dark matter haloes above @xmath32 m@xmath30 are recovered to within @xmath33kpc between the two volumes , allowing straightforward halo - halo matching in the large majority of cases .    the millennium gas simulations used exactly the same cosmological parameters as those stated above . with the inclusion of a gaseous component ,",
    "additional care needs to be taken in choosing the gravitational softening length in order to avoid spurious heating @xcite .",
    "we use a comoving value of @xmath34 kpc , roughly 4% of the mean interparticle separation @xcite until @xmath35 , above which a maximum comoving value of @xmath36 kpc pertains .",
    "we have adopted a different output strategy for the millennium gas simulations , preferring to output uniformly in time with an interval roughly corresponding to the dynamical time of objects of interest .",
    "this strategy results in 160 rather than 64 outputs and places particular emphasis on the late stages of the simulation .",
    "fossil groups are selected according to a combination of x - ray and optical criteria , based on the observational definition given by @xcite , which is widely followed in the literature .",
    "their x - ray luminosity must satisfy @xmath37erg s@xmath4 , and the difference between the @xmath25-band magnitudes of the first and second ranked galaxies , within half the projected radius enclosing 200 times the mean density ( @xmath5 ) , must be @xmath38 magnitudes . a limit of 0.5@xmath5 is used because @xmath1 galaxies within this radius should spiral into the centre of the group due to orbital decay by dynamical friction within a hubble time @xcite .",
    "the limit on the bolometric x - ray luminosity @xmath39 helps to exclude poor groups and individual galaxies with a few small satellites .",
    "such groups are often not in dynamical equilibrium , and in addition there might be a gap in their galaxy luminosity function simply as a result of the small numbers of galaxies involved .",
    "we address this issue in   [ sch ] .      for this investigation , we first selected dark matter haloes from the millennium gas simulation with masses @xmath40m@xmath14 .",
    "[ aadfig1 ] demonstrates , all haloes for which @xmath41erg s@xmath4 are expected to be included in this sample and thus our fossil sample will be complete .",
    "a bolometric x - ray luminosity of @xmath42 erg s@xmath4 corresponds to a temperature of @xmath43 kev .",
    "this constraint on the halo masses results in an initial sample of 51538 dark matter haloes , within which we search for fossil groups .    in order to extract information about dark matter and galaxy properties , for each of these 51538 haloes found in the millennium gas simulation",
    ", the counterpart in the millennium simulation needs to be found .",
    "this is a straightforward procedure because the simulated volume and the amplitudes and phases of the initial power spectrum were matched .",
    "however , the dark - matter - only millennium simulation has 20 times the mass resolution of the corresponding millennium gas simulation and so contains some additional small scale power .",
    "this leads to small offsets ( typically around twice the gravitational softening length ) in the final co - ordinates of equivalent haloes , and even smaller mass differences ( typically less than @xmath44 ) .",
    "of the 51538 haloes , 48774 ( @xmath4595% ) have corresponding haloes identified in the millennium simulation . for each of these matched haloes we extracted the coordinates and",
    "@xmath46 magnitudes for each galaxy contained within @xmath5 , from the publically available catalogue of @xcite .",
    "the simulated properties of the galaxies occupying each dark matter halo were then used to calculate @xmath47 , i.e. the difference in @xmath25-band magnitude of the first and second ranked galaxies within 0.5@xmath5 of the centre of the halo . out of the 48774 matched haloes , 6502",
    "are found to be _ optical fossil groups _ , i.e. haloes with @xmath48  mag , among which 1300 are _ x - ray fossil groups _ , i.e. optical fossil groups with @xmath49  erg  s@xmath4 . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ aadfig2 ] , x - ray fossil groups do not form a separate population but are rather extreme examples of a smooth distribution .",
    "it is also clear that the spread in @xmath47 increases dramatically with decreasing in the x - ray luminosity and hence the enclosed mass , in agreement with the conditional luminosity function ( clf ) formalism of @xcite .",
    "control groups are necessary for our study in order to allow us to compare the properties of x - ray fossil and non - fossil groups .",
    "we define two control group samples , based on the magnitude difference of the two brightest members of the group ( within 0.5@xmath5 of the centre of the dark matter halo ) : ( i ) @xmath50 , and ( ii ) @xmath51 . while members of the former are examples of intermediate groups , the latter could be regarded as a class of extreme non - fossil groups in that they contain at least two galaxies of very similar magnitude .",
    "the bolometric x - ray luminosity limit for each of the control samples is the same as that of the x - ray fossil group sample ( see fig .",
    "[ aadfig2 ] ) .",
    "one of the central criteria used to define fossils is the absence of galaxies within a range of two magnitudes of the brightest galaxy ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "however , for groups with only a small number of members , there is a significant probability of obtaining such a luminosity gap as a natural consequence of the high - end tail of the galaxy luminosity distribution . to quantify the likelihood of obtaining a value of @xmath53 by chance",
    ", @xcite performed 10@xmath54 monte carlo simulations for groups and clusters with absolute magnitudes selected at random from a schechter function @xcite . using the parameters of the composite luminosity function of mkw / awm clusters",
    "@xcite , they found that for the systems of @xmath4540 galaxies , 0.4@xmath550.06% of the generated luminosity functions had @xmath56 .",
    "we performed a similar analysis for groups spanning a range in richness , and using parameters appropriate to our data from the millennium simulation . for twenty classes of groups , containing 10 , 15 , 20 , 25 ,",
    "... galaxies respectively , we randomly generated galaxies according to a schechter luminosity function .",
    "( none of our x - ray fossil groups from the millennium simulation contain fewer than 10 galaxies . ) the characteristic magnitude m@xmath57 and faint - end exponent @xmath58 , were adopted from a fit of the schechter function to the @xmath25-band luminosity function of the semi - analytic catalogue . a magnitude cut off of @xmath59",
    "was then applied to the magnitude of generated galaxies as this is the @xmath25-band magnitude completeness limit of the semi - analytic catalogue .",
    "10@xmath60 simulations were carried out for each richness class of group .",
    "[ aadfig3 ] compares the percentage of optical and x - ray fossil groups from the millennium simulation as a function of number of galaxies within 0.5@xmath5 for each dark matter halo , with those populated using a schechter luminosity function as detailed above .",
    "the lower panel shows the result when the expected number of randomly generated groups with @xmath61 , is subtracted from the optical fossils . for poor systems ,",
    "the incidence of ` statistical fossils ' is significant . it can be seen that approximately one third of the fossil systems with fewer than 25 galaxies seen in the millennium data can be attributed to statistical chance ( as opposed to the result of physical processes generating a non - statistical luminosity gap ) .",
    "however , even after these random fossils are removed , the fraction of optical fossils increases as the number of galaxies within dark matter haloes decreases .",
    "in contrast , for x - ray fossils , many of the poor haloes which qualify as statistical fossils fail to pass the x - ray luminosity threshold criterion , so the chance fraction is never much larger than 20% .",
    "we return to this issue in sec .",
    "[ abundance ] . for groups with more than 30 galaxies , the fraction of fossils meeting the @xmath61 criterion by chance drops below 1.0% , and soon becomes negligible .",
    "if galaxies in groups and clusters merge with the central galaxy over a finite time to produce a progressively greater massive central galaxy , then one way to quantify the dynamical age of a galaxy system is to measure the luminosity gap between the two most luminous galaxies remaining in the group , provided that there is no infall of bright galaxies from other nearby systems .",
    "a relaxed x - ray morphology in observed fossils is an indication of the absence of such a process .",
    "within such a merging scenario for the formation of the brightest group galaxy , the luminosity gap distribution depends on the halo merger rates .",
    "this has previously only been examined in analytical studies @xcite , or in large - scale cosmological simulations without a hot baryonic component .",
    "thus , while an important observational criterion for defining fossils relies on the x - ray properties of the group , this has not previously been implemented within the models .",
    "here we compare the luminosity gap distribution between the luminous galaxies found at the centre of dark matter haloes extracted from the millennium simulation with expectations from the analytical model of @xcite , and with observational properties from sdss clusters .    @xcite compared the distribution of the predicted luminosity gaps from their analytical model within @xmath5 , as a function of halo mass , with the observed luminosity gaps in the sdss ( dr4 ) clusters @xcite , ranging in mass and redshift from @xmath62m@xmath14 and @xmath63=0.02 to 0.17 , respectively , within a projected physical radius of 500 @xmath9kpc .",
    "halo merger rates in their model have been analytically estimated according to the excursion - set theory of @xcite , which is also known as the extended press - schechter formalism . assuming a halo density profile of the form of @xcite , a subhalo of mass @xmath64 merges into a primary halo of mass @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) and makes a composite halo . as the centre of the subhalo crosses the virial radius of the new composite halo",
    ", a merger happens .",
    "then the subhalo spirals toward the centre of the composite halo in a near circular orbit , experiencing dynamical friction .    for comparison with the above study",
    ", we evaluate the @xmath25-band luminosity difference between the first and second most luminous ( @xmath47 ) and the first and the third most luminous ( @xmath67 ) galaxies in our millennium data within @xmath5 and within 500 @xmath9kpc . in fig .",
    "[ aadfig4 ] , we plot the @xmath25-band luminosity gap distribution of the millennium simulation for the same mass range as the models , together with the luminosity gap distribution of 730 sdss c4 clusters @xcite .",
    "[ aadfig4]a and  [ aadfig4]b compare the predicted gap statistics from @xcite for two values of the coulomb logarithm , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , within @xmath5 .",
    "since the parameter @xmath70 is proportional to the force of dynamical friction between the centres of subhalo and primary halo during the process of merging , a higher value of @xmath71 corresponds to a faster effective halo merger rate . in numerical simulations , @xmath70 is approximated by @xmath72 , where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the maximum and minimum impact parameters respectively , and @xmath70 is expected to be @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "however , in the semi - analytic galaxy catalogues @xcite , based on the millennium simulation , used in this work , the above relation is approximated by @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the halo mass of the satellite galaxy .    within the mass range of the sdss data",
    "there are 8842 haloes in the millennium simulation catalogue .",
    "accordingly , in fig .  [ aadfig4 ] ,",
    "our data have been normalised to be comparable with the sdss data and the theoretical model of @xcite . however , the simulation data is , unlike the observations , complete and uncontaminated by spurious groups or foreground and background galaxies .",
    "all these effects are likely to be heavily dependent on the number of galaxies residing in the halo . as such , the comparison with the sdss data shown in fig .",
    "[ aadfig4 ] should be treated with caution .",
    "given this caveat , our analysis based on the millennium simulation catalogues agrees remarkably well with the models of @xcite based on the sdss survey for the luminosity gap distribution of the two brightest galaxies in each of the dark matter haloes , particularly for @xmath78 ( fig .  [ aadfig4]a ) . however , for the @xmath25-band luminosity gap between the brightest and third brightest galaxies in each system ( fig .",

    "sdss cluster masses have been estimated from total @xmath79-band luminosities , so any inaccuracies in this procedure would affect the comparison with the millennium data .    observationally there is an excess population of groups with a small luminosity gap between the first and second ranked galaxies , above what is predicted by the theoretical models or the simulations .",
    "this excess population is likely to result from contamination of observed group samples by local structure alignments , and renormalising to a sample without these groups scales down the `` millennium '' distribution in fig .",

    "the probability of finding fossil systems is expected to increase with decreasing halo mass , as shown in previous studies based on theoretical models or hydrodynamical simulations @xcite .",

    "1 ) within which the @xmath82mag criterion is imposed .",
    "clearly , the larger the search radius , the more demanding is the requirement on the galaxy contents of the system , and the smaller the fraction of groups which will qualify as fossils .    in fig .",

    "comparison between these different estimates is difficult , since both the search radius and the halo mass range varies considerably from study to study .",

    "based on a comparison with the integrated local x - ray luminosity function of @xcite , @xcite estimated that x - ray fossil systems constitute 8 - 20% of all systems of the same x - ray luminosity ( @xmath88erg s@xmath4 ) .",

    "various observational properties @xcite have suggested an early formation epoch for fossils . @xcite and @xcite used a set of twelve high - resolution numerical simulations in the @xmath10cdm cosmology to study the formation of fossil groups , and found a correlation for the magnitude gap between the brightest and second - brightest galaxies and the halo formation epoch , with fossils accreting half of their final dark matter mass at @xmath105 .",
    "such an early assembly of fossil haloes leaves enough time for l@xmath106 galaxies to merge into the central one by dynamical friction , resulting in the observed magnitude gap at @xmath21 .",
    "[ aadfig9 ] shows the history of mass assembly of a typical example of a massive fossil group ( right panel ) and a control group ( left panel ) from the millennium gas simulation from redshift @xmath107 to @xmath21 .",
    "the dimension of each image is @xmath108 mpc , centred around the central halo .",
    "it can be seen that at @xmath109 , the x - ray fossil group has already largely been assembled , while the control group has considerable substructure even at a later epoch .",
    "we studied the history of the mass assembly of fossil groups , selected using the usual observational criteria at @xmath94 , from a redshift @xmath110 to the present day , within the millennium simulation .",
    "a sample of x - ray fossil groups was defined from the millennium simulations and associated gas and galaxy catalogues , according to the usual criteria : ( a ) the difference between the @xmath25-band magnitudes of the first and second ranked galaxies , within half the projected radius enclosing 200 times the mean density of material ( @xmath5 ) , is @xmath38 magnitudes , and ( b ) the bolometric x - ray luminosity of the group is @xmath111erg s@xmath4 .",
    "while optical fossil groups fulfill just the first condition , x - ray fossils satisfy both criteria .",
    "our main results are as follows :    * the space density of x - ray fossil groups is in close agreement with the observed space density of fossils with @xmath112 @xmath113erg s@xmath4 .",
    "although for low luminosity fossils we find roughly 1/3 of the observed fossil space density , there are several potential factors that could lead to this difference . as well as",
    "significant uncertainties in the observational studies , the x - ray properties of haloes in the real universe show far greater scatter than those seen in the preheating simulation used here @xcite . given the x - ray luminosity threshold in the definition of an x - ray fossil , scatter in @xmath87",
    "will alter the x - ray fossil number density , since the number density of haloes is a steep function of mass .",
    "* by selecting optical fossils from groups randomly generated from a schechter luminosity function , we demonstrate that for small numbers of galaxies per group , a significant fraction of optical fossil groups are expected to be purely statistical , requiring no special physical mechanism to generate the 2 magnitude luminosity gap .",
    "for groups with more than 40 members , this effect largely disappears , with very few fossil groups expected at random . *",
    "the probability of finding optical fossils with mass @xmath65 , i.e , @xmath114 is a decreasing function of : ( a ) group dark matter halo mass and , ( b ) the fraction of the virial radius within which the first and second brightest galaxies are being found .",
    "conversely , as dark matter halo mass become small , the probability @xmath115 for x - ray fossils decreases . *",
    "both high - mass and low - mass x - ray fossil groups are found to have assembled @xmath116 of their final masses by a redshift of @xmath117 .",
    "the corresponding mass fraction is about @xmath118 for two different sets of high - mass control samples , and @xmath119 for low - mass control samples , where groups fulfill the same x - ray luminosity criterion ( @xmath120m@xmath14 ) but have the optical luminosity gaps corresponding @xmath121 and @xmath122  magnitudes .",
    "this study shows that fossils indeed are formed early , with more than @xmath4580% of their mass accumulated as early as 4  gyr ago .",
    "they are also relatively isolated compared to non - fossils .",
    "the strongest x - ray fossil candidates are those with the highest x - ray luminosity as these systems are not expected to have a large luminosity gap between their first and second ranked galaxies entirely by chance . as always , systems with more than a handful of galaxies are to be preferred .    in principle ,",
    "comparison of the observed space density of fossils as a function of x - ray luminosity with that of fossils from simulations can provide valuable constraints on the treatment of physical processes included in the simulations . the tentative evidence for a discrepancy , whereby the observed space density of low x - ray luminosity fossil groups may exceed that predicted from the simulations , will be worth revisiting in the future , when better observational estimates are available .",
    "it is interesting that while the amount of recent mass assembly in control groups increases with halo mass , as is expected in the hierarchical growth paradigm , there is almost no difference between the mass assembly of high - mass and low - mass x - ray fossils after redshift @xmath123 ( see fig .",
    "[ aadfig10 ] ) .",
    "it seems that both low - mass and high - mass fossil systems are undisturbed at low redshift .",
    "since we expect faster orbital decay and more efficient galaxy merging in lower mass systems , due to the lower velocity dispersion of individual galaxies within the group , we would expect to find a higher incidence rate of fossils amongst poor groups .",
    "fig.[aadfig3 ] shows that this is indeed the case , but the effect is not very strong , once the influence of statistical fossils is removed , and in x - ray fossils any rising trend at low richness is overwhelmed by the fact that many of the optical fossils fail to exceed the x - ray luminosity threshold .",
    "a word of caution about the treatment of orbital decay is in order here . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ semianalytic ] , the orbital evolution of subhaloes in the millennium simulation is well treated until these subhaloes are reduced by stripping to 20 dark matter particles , but thereafter is calculated semi - analytically , using an approximate formula . in practice , a significant fraction of the second ranked galaxies in the fossil systems we have extracted from the simulation have been stripped below this 20 particle limit .",
    "for example , in fossils with masses of only @xmath124m@xmath14 , approximately 35% of second ranked galaxies have been stripped below the limit , though this fraction drops to @xmath4510% for systems with mass @xmath125m@xmath14 .",
    "for such galaxies the timescale for their subsequent decay and merger with the central galaxy is not very reliable .",
    "however , this is not a major issue for massive haloes , and it is interesting and surprising that the incidence of fossils in rich systems is fairly flat at 3 - 4% .",
    "observational studies should , in due course , show whether this is reflected in the real universe .",
    "one example of a fairly rich fossil cluster has already been reported by @xcite .",
    "the magnitude gap distribution of haloes at different x - ray luminosities and the mass evolution of fossil groups discussed above both support the idea that x - ray fossil groups are not a distinct class of objects but rather that they are extreme examples of groups which collapse early and experience little recent growth , so that their galaxies have time to undergo orbital decay and merging .",
    "the x - ray and optical scaling properties of such extreme groups can be expected to differ from those of groups with more typical evolutionary histories , and such differences have already been observed @xcite .",
    "a comparison of such observed differences with the properties seen in the millennium simulation groups is underway , and should provide a valuable check on the adequacy with which feedback processes and other baryon physics is handled in the simulations .",
    "the millennium simulation used in this paper was carried out by the virgo supercomputing consortium at the computing centre of the max - planck society in garching .",
    "the semi - analytic galaxy catalogue is publicly available at http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/galform/agnpaper .",
    "the millennium gas simulations were carried out at the nottingham hpc facility , as was much of the analysis required by this work .",
