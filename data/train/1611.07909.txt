    "image segmentation can be thought as a signal decomposition problem , where the goal is to decompose the signal into several components such that each one represents the same content or semantic information .",
    "one special case is the background - foreground segmentation , which tries to decompose an image into two components , background and foreground .",
    "foreground - background segmentation has many applications in image processing such as separate coding of background and foreground in video compression , organ detection in medical images , text extraction , and medical image analysis @xcite-@xcite .",
    "different algorithms have been proposed in the past for foreground - background segmentation , including k - means clustering in djvu @xcite , shape primitive extraction and coding ( spec ) @xcite , least absolute deviation fitting @xcite , and sparse - smooth decomposition @xcite .",
    "the hierarchical k - means clustering applies the k - means clustering algorithm with k=2 on blocks in multi - resolution .",
    "it first applies the k - means clustering algorithm on a large block to obtain foreground and background colors and then uses them as the initial foreground and background colors for the smaller blocks in the next stages .",
    "it also applies some post - processing at the end to refine the results .",
    "this algorithm has difficulty for the regions where background and foreground color intensities overlap and some part of the background will be detected as foreground . in the shape primitive extraction and coding ( spec ) method , a two - step segmentation algorithm is proposed . in the first step the algorithm classifies each block of size @xmath0 into either pictorial block or text / graphics , by comparing the number of colors with the threshold 32 . in the second step ,",
    "segmentation result of pictorial blocks is refined by extracting shape primitives . because of variations in image content , it is hard to find a fixed threshold on the number of colors that can robustly separate pictorial blocks and text / graphics blocks .",
    "one problem with clustering - based segmentation techniques is that if the intensity of background pixels has a large dynamic range , some part of the background could be segmented as foreground .",
    "one such example is shown in fig .",
    "1 , where the foreground mask ( a binary mask showing the location of foreground pixels ) for a sample image by hierarchical clustering and the proposed algorithm are shown .         to overcome this problem , in a previous work we proposed a least absolute deviation fitting method , which fits a smooth model to the image and classifies regions in the image based on their smoothness @xcite .",
    "it uses the @xmath1 norm on the fitting error to enforce the sparsity of the error term .",
    "although this algorithm achieved significantly better segmentation than both djvu and spec , it suffers from two problems .",
    "first , it does not impose any connectivity on the pixels in the foreground layer , which could result in many isolated points in the foreground .",
    "second , it uses a fixed set of smooth basis functions and does not impose any restrictions on the smooth model parameters , which could result in overfitting the smooth model to the image . in this work",
    "we propose a sparse decomposition based segmentation , which tries to resolve these problems .",
    "sparse representation has been used for various applications in recent years , including face recognition , super - resolution , morphological component analysis , image restoration , image denoising and sparse coding @xcite-@xcite . within our sparse decomposition framework",
    ", we also impose suitable priors on each layer , in particular smoothness on the background , and connectivity on the foreground . to promote the connectivity of the foreground component",
    ", the group - sparsity of the foreground pixels is added to the cost function .",
    "it is worth mentioning that total - variation can also be used to promote connectivity , and it is used in some of our previous works @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this algorithm is tested on an image segmentation dataset and is shown to be very successful .",
    "the structure of the rest of this paper is as follows : section ii presents the main idea of the proposed segmentation algorithm .",
    "section iii describes the admm formulation for solving the proposed optimization problem .",
    "section iv provides the experimental results for the proposed algorithm , and the paper is concluded in section v.",
    "the proposed sparse decomposition algorithm in this work segments a given image into two layers , background and foreground .",
    "the background contains the smooth part of the image and can be well represented with a few smooth basis functions , whereas the foreground contains the text and graphics , which can not be represented with a smooth model .",
    "using the fact that foreground pixels usually occupy a small percentage of the images , we can model them with a sparse component overlaid on top of the background . therefore it makes sense to think of mixed content image as a superposition of two layers , one smooth and the other one sparse .",
    "hence we can use sparse decomposition techniques to separate these two components .",
    "each image is first divided into non - overlapping blocks of size @xmath2 , denoted with @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 designate the horizontal and vertical axes .",
    "then it is represented as a sum of two components @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 denote the smooth background and sparse foreground components respectively .",
    "the background is modeled as a linear combination of @xmath9 basis functions @xmath10 , where @xmath11 denotes a 2d smooth basis function @xcite , and @xmath12 denote the parameters of this smooth model .",
    "since this model is linear in parameters , @xmath13 , it is simpler to find the optimal weights . to find @xmath11 ,",
    "the karhunen - loeve transform @xcite is applied to a training set of smooth background images and it turns out the optimal learned bases are very similar to 2d dct bases .",
    "therefore a set of low - frequency two - dimensional dct basis functions are used in our model .",
    "dct bases are shown to be very efficient for image representation and compression @xcite .",
    "all the possible basis functions are ordered in the conventional zig - zag order in the @xmath14 plane , and the first @xmath9 basis functions are chosen .",
    "hence each image block can be represented as : @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 correspond to the smooth background region and foreground pixels respectively .",
    "+ to have a more compact notation , we convert all 2d blocks of size @xmath18 into vectors of length @xmath19 , denoted by @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( for @xmath3 and @xmath17 ) , and show @xmath10 as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a matrix of size @xmath24 in which the @xmath25-th column corresponds to the vectorized version of @xmath11 and @xmath26^\\text{t}$ ]",
    ". then eq .",
    "( 1 ) can be written as : @xmath27    the decomposition problem in eq .",
    "( 2 ) is a highly ill - posed problem .",
    "therefore we need to impose some priors on @xmath28 and @xmath21 to be able to perform this decomposition . here",
    "three priors are imposed , sparsity of @xmath28 , sparsity of the foreground and connectivity of the foreground .",
    "the reason for imposing sparsity on @xmath28 is that we do not want to use too many basis functions for background representation .",
    "without such a restriction on the coefficients , we might end up with the situation in which all foreground pixels are also modeled by the smooth layer .",
    "the second prior , sparsity of foreground , is inspired from the fact that the foreground pixels are expected to occupy a small percentage of pixels in each block .",
    "the last but not the least point is that we expect the nonzero components of the foreground to be connected to each other and we do not want to have a set of isolated points detected as foreground . therefore we can add a group sparsity regularization to promote the connectivity of the foreground pixels . + we can incorporate all these priors in an optimization problem as shown below : @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the weights for regularization terms that need to be tuned , and @xmath32 shows the group - sparsity on foreground .",
    "for the first two terms since @xmath33 is not convex , we replace them with @xmath1 which is its relaxed - convex version . for the group - sparsity we used the mixed @xmath34 norm of @xmath21 @xcite , which is defined as : @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes the @xmath37-th group . here",
    "we have overlapping groups , which consist of all columns and rows in the image .",
    "therefore we can show the group sparsity term as the summation of two terms , one over all columns and the other one over all rows of image as : @xmath38 then we will get the following problem : @xmath39    this problem can be solved with different approaches , such as proximal optimization @xcite , alternating direction method of multipliers ( admm ) @xcite , and slasso algorithm @xcite . here",
    "we present the formulation using admm algorithm .",
    "admm is a popular algorithm , which combines the superior convergence properties of method of multiplier and decomposability of dual ascent .",
    "the admm formulation for the optimization problem in ( 6 ) can be derived by introducing auxiliary variables as : @xmath40 then the augmented lagrangian for the above problem can be formed as : @xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 denote the dual variables , and @xmath46 denote the penalty terms .",
    "then , we can solve this optimization problem by taking the gradient of the objective function w.r.t . the primal variables and setting it to zero and using dual descent for dual variables .",
    "after doing some simplification , we will get the update rule described in algorithm 1 for solving the optimization problem in ( 7 ) .    @xmath47 $ ] @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55    here @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 denotes the soft - thresholding operator @xcite applied element - wise and is defined as : @xmath59 and @xmath60 is the soft - thresholding operator defined for vectors as : @xmath61 with @xmath62 . for scalar @xmath7 , block soft - thresholding reduces to the scalar soft - thresholding operator",
    "to evaluate the performance of our algorithm , we have tested the proposed algorithm on the same screen content image segmentation dataset provided in @xcite , which consist of 332 image blocks of size 64x64 , extracted from sample frames of hevc test sequences for screen content coding @xcite , @xcite . in our implementation , the block size is chosen to be @xmath63=64 . the number of dct basis functions , @xmath9 , is chosen to be 10 .",
    "the weight parameters in the objective function are tuned by testing on a validation set and are set to be @xmath64 and @xmath65 . the admm algorithm described in algorithm 1",
    "is implemented in matlab and is publicly available in @xcite .",
    "the number of iterations for admm is chosen to be 50 and the parameters @xmath46 are all set to 1 .",
    "we compare the proposed algorithm with three previous algorithms ; hierarchical k - means clustering in djvu , spec , and lad . for spec ,",
    "we have adapted the color number threshold and the shape primitive size threshold from the default value given in @xcite when necessary to give a more satisfactory result .    to provide a numerical comparison , we report the average precision , recall and f1 score @xcite achieved by different algorithms over this dataset .",
    "the average precision , recall and f1 score by different algorithms are given in table 1 .",
    "recall &   f1 score + spec @xcite &  50% &   64% &  56.1% + hierarchical clustering @xcite &  64% &  69% &  66.4% + least absolute deviation @xcite &   91.4% &   87% &   89.1% + the proposed algorithm &  93.7% &  86.7% &   90% +    [ tblcomp ]    the precision and recall are defined as in eq .",
    "( 8) , where tp , fp and fn denote true positive , false positive and false negative respectively . in our evaluation , we treat a foreground pixel as positive .",
    "a pixel that is correctly identified as foreground ( compared to the manual segmentation ) is considered true positive . the same holds for false negative and false positive .",
    "the balanced f1 score is defined as the harmonic mean of precision and recall , as it is shown in eq 9 .",
    "@xmath66 @xmath67    0.18        0.18        0.18     0.18      0.18      +    0.18        0.18        0.18     0.18      0.18      +    0.18        0.18        0.18     0.18      0.18      +    0.18        0.18        0.18     0.18      0.18      +    0.18        0.18        0.18     0.18      0.18     as it can be seen , the proposed scheme achieves much higher precision and recall than hierarchical k - means clustering and spec algorithms .",
    "compared to the least absolute deviation fitting , the proposed formulation yields significant improvement in terms of precision , while also having a slightly higher recall rate .    to see the visual quality of the segmentation , the results for 5 test images ( each consisting of multiple 64@xmath6864 blocks ) are shown in fig .",
    "it can be seen that the proposed algorithm gives superior performance over djvu and spec in all cases .",
    "there are also noticeable improvement over our prior approach using least absolute deviation fitting .",
    "we would like to note that , this dataset mainly consists of challenging images where the background and foreground have overlapping color ranges . for simpler cases where the background has a narrow color range that is quite different from the foreground , both djvu and least absolute deviation fitting will work well . on the other hand",
    ", spec does not work well when the background is fairly homogeneous within a block and the foreground text / lines have varying colors . to illustrate the smoothness of the background layer and its suitability for being coded with transform - based coding , the filled background layer of a sample image is presented in fig .",
    "the background holes ( pixels belonging to the foreground layer ) are filled by the predicted value using the smooth model , which is obtained using the least squares fitting to the detected background pixels .",
    "as we can see , the background layer is very smooth and does not contain any text and graphics .",
    "to show the application of the proposed algorithm for medical image segmentation , we present its result for the task of blood vessel segmentation .",
    "the result for a sample image is shown in fig .",
    "4 . as it can be seen the blood vessels have a very low contrast with background , makes it difficult to be segment them from background .",
    "this paper proposed a new approach toward foreground / background segmentation in images .",
    "the background is modeled as a linear combination of a set of low - frequency 2d dct functions and foreground as a sparse component overlaid on the background .",
    "we propose a sparse decomposition framework to decompose the image into these two layers . the group sparsity of foreground is penalized to promote the connectivity of foreground pixels . compared to our prior least absolute fitting formulation",
    ", the background layer is allowed to choose as many bases from a rich set of smooth functions , but the coefficients are enforced to be sparse so that will not falsely include foreground pixels .",
    "this algorithm has been tested on several test images and compared with some of the previous well - known algorithms for background / foreground separation and has shown significantly better performance in most cases . in terms of applications ,",
    "this algorithm can be used in layered coding in video compression , as a pre - processing step in text extraction , and also in medical image segmentation .",
