    "method of vlbi first proposed by matveenko , kardashev and sholomitsky ( 1965 ) is used for two major applications : making images of compact radio sources and measuring antenna s motion with respect to extragalactic source .",
    "fringe amplitudes and phases measured with precision @xmath0@xmath1 are used as primary observables for imaging ; group delays measured with relative precision @xmath2@xmath3 are used as observables for geodynamics applications .",
    "group delay is sensitive to the projection of the baseline vector to the source direction .",
    "having observed many sources in different directions and different baselines we are able to solve for source positions , site positions , earth orientation parameters ( eop ) and the rate of their changes in a least square solution .",
    "the paper of overs , fanselow and jacobs ( 1998 ) provides an overview of geodetic vlbi technique .",
    "there are several measures of how precise results are . formal uncertainties , which are calculated according to a law of propagation of errors of an individual observation , are the first measure . this estimate gives us an upper limit of precision , since an estimation model usually does not account correlations correctly .",
    "another measure of precision is repeatability  the root mean square deviation of the series of estimates of the targeted parameter with respect to the average . and",
    "the last measure is accuracy : the measure of how far our estimate of the targeted parameter is from the true value .",

    "although site positions and source coordinates are determined in processing vlbi observations , and they can be useful for particular applications , such as source mapping , determination of _ positions _ is not the objective per se .",

    "dissipation in the ocean and in the liquid body causes appearance of the non - zero imaginary part of the transfer function .",
    "fitting empirical transfer function to a model allowed buffett , mathews , & herring , ( 2002 ) to estimate so - called basic earth paramenters which includes the core mantle boundary flattening and the magnitude of the magnetic field at the core mantle boundary ( 0.7mt ) .",
    "vlbi observations allowed us to detect a secondary tidal effect : site displacements caused by water mass redistribution due to ocean tides .",
    "mass loading results in crust deformation even thousands kilometers away from the mass load .",

    "comparison of the observed amplitudes with theoretical amplitudes at many vlbi sites , including vlba antennas , allowed petrov and ma ( 2003 ) to discriminate between competing models of ocean tides .",
    "it is relatively easy to validate ocean tides models close to the shore where tide gauges are located , but it is a challenge to validate ocean tides models at open ocean .    [",

    "changes in atmospheric pressure are not predictable . however , global numerical weather models based on past observations of the world meteorological network allow us to compute displacements due to atmospheric pressure loading with latency several days . examples of the atmospheric pressure loading are presented in fig .",

    "comparison of the admittance factors of the theoretical time series for all sites , including vlba sites , showed surprisingly well agreement between the theoretical model and observations , even for horizontal loading which does not exceed 1  mm for most of the sites .",

    "six other stations do not exhibit relative horizontal motion with respect to each other at the level exceeding 1 mm during entire history of the vlba .",
    "exceptionally high precision of the earth orientation parameters makes 20  station experiments correlated at the vlba correlator especially attractive for investigation of free core nutation  a poorly understood phenomenon of variable amplitude with the period around 430 days . unlike forced nutation caused by torques exerted by moon , sun and planets , the mechanism of excitation of the free core nutation",
