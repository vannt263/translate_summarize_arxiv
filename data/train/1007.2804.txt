    "chaotic phase synchronization ( cps ) , referred to as the locking of the phases of the coupled chaotically evolving dynamical systems , has been investigated in ensembles of globally coupled arrays  @xcite , networks of oscillators  @xcite with applications to electrochemistry  @xcite , laser systems  @xcite , cardiorespiratory systems  @xcite , neuroscience  @xcite , ecology  @xcite , climatology  @xcite , etc . even though the notion of cps is well studied in low dimensional systems , there exist very little indepth studies in higher dimensional systems such as time - delay systems which are essentially infinite - dimensional in nature and often exhibit high - dimensional , highly non - phase - coherent hyperchaotic attractors with complex topological structure .",
    "consequently , estimating phase explicitly to identify phase synchronization in such systems is quite difficult .",
    "nevertheless , cps has been recently demonstrated in two coupled piecewise linear and mackey - glass time - delay systems  @xcite by introducing a nonlinear transformation of the original dynamical variable to recast the original non - phase - coherent hyperchaotic attractors into smeared limit cycle - like attractors in order to facilitate the estimation of the phase variable using the available methods .",
    "however , these investigations are carried out so far only in two coupled time - delay systems . in view of the widespread applications of cps in ensembles of coupled oscillators , here",
    "we investigate the existence of global phase synchronization ( gps ) in an array of unidirectionally coupled mackey - glass time - delay systems and analyse the mechanism behind the dynamical organization of the coupled oscillators to form gps . at first",
    ", we use the nonlinear transformation introduced in  @xcite to estimate explicitly the phases of all the oscillators in the array and identify the existence of gps in the array .",
    "further , the existence of gps is also confirmed from the original non - phase - coherent chaotic attractors themselves using two independent approaches , namely recurrence analysis  @xcite and the concept of localized sets  @xcite .",
    "in addition , we will show that the onset of gps in such arrays does not happen instantaneously , but instead takes place as a form of sequential synchronization . for lower values of coupling strengths the phases of nearby systems get already synchronized with the drive system in contrast to the far away systems .",
    "this sequential synchronization of chaotic systems can have applications in communication systems  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , other non - synchronized time - delay systems with respect to the sequentially synchronized cluster display clusters of phase synchronized states among themselves before they become synchronized with the large cluster in the sequence to form global phase synchronization .",
    "this clustering is observed when the group of oscillators splits into subgroups such that all the oscillators within one cluster move in perfect phase synchrony .",
    "this clustering is considered to be particularly significant in biological systems  @xcite .",
    "recently cluster synchronization in an array of three chaotic lasers without delay was reported  @xcite as well . also global synchronization via cluster formation has been observed in coupled phase oscillators without time - delay  @xcite with simultaneous phase slips of all oscillators , where quantized phase shifts in these phase slips have been observed . by increasing the coupling ,",
    "a bifurcation tree from high - dimensional quasiperiodicity to chaos to quasiperiodicity and periodicity has also been found .",
    "the remaining paper is organized as follows : in sec .",

    "the mackey - glass time - delay system was originally deduced as a model for blood production in patients with leukemia  @xcite , and it has been well studied in the literature for its hyperchaotic behavior  @xcite and has also been experimentally realized using analog electronic circuits  @xcite . in this paper , we consider a linear array of unidirectionally coupled mackey - glass systems with free - end boundary conditions represented by the following system of coupled nonlinear first order ordinary differential equations ,    @xmath3    [ eq_1 ]     the first four maximal lyapunov exponents @xmath4 of the mackey - glass time - delay system ( [ eq_1]a ) for the parameter values @xmath5 in the absence of the coupling @xmath6 . ]",

    "is introduced so as to rescale the original non - phase - coherent chaotic attractor into smeared limit cycle - like attractor with a single center of rotation .",
    "the transformation is performed by introducing a new state variable  @xcite , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the optimal value of time - delay to be chosen in order to avoid any additional center of rotation .",
    "this functional form of transformation ( along with a delay time @xmath17 ) has been identified by generalizing the transformation used in the case of chaotic attractors in the lorenz systems  @xcite .",
    "now , the projected trajectory in the new state space ( @xmath18 ) ( fig .  [ fig1]b ) resembles that of a smeared limit cycle - like attractor with a single fixed center of rotation .",
    "it is also to be noted that , even though the transformed attractor has sharp turns in the vicinity of the common center , it does not have any closed loops as in the original non - phase - coherent attractor .",
    "otherwise , the transformed attractor would not give rise to monotonically increasing phase resulting in exact matching of the phases of the coupled time - delay systems  @xcite .",
    "in this section , we will show that the global phase synchronization in the array of mackey - glass time - delay systems ( [ eq_1 ] ) is attained by a sequential phase synchronization of the oscillators in the array as the coupling strength is increased .",
    "further we will also demonstrate that the remaining non - synchronized oscillators in the array form synchronized clusters among themselves before attaining gps .",
    "we use the same nonlinear transformation ( [ eq_2 ] ) to recast the original non - phase - coherent chaotic attractors of all the @xmath13 oscillators into smeared limit cycle - like attractors .",

    "the phase differences become zero ( figs .  [ fig2 ] ) indicating the existence of phase synchronization between the drive and the response systems .",

    "[ fig5 ] and  [ fig14 ] ) .",
    "further increase in @xmath6 results in the formation of a single large cluster whose constituents exhibit a coherent phase oscillation with the drive due to the decomposition of the clusters away from the drive in the array .",

    "similar mechanism has been identified in ensemble of coupled rssler oscillators with frequency mismatches  @xcite ( without time - delay ) .    the above dynamical organization of gps via sequential phase synchronization and the clustering can be also be visualized clearly by using snap shots of the oscillators in the index vs index plot , as node vs node diagrams , as shown in fig .",

    "<S> we report the identification of global phase synchronization ( gps ) in a linear array of unidirectionally coupled mackey - glass time - delay systems exhibiting highly non - phase - coherent chaotic attractors with complex topological structure . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we show that the dynamical organization of all the coupled time - delay systems in the array to form gps is achieved by sequential synchronization as a function of the coupling strength . </S>",
    "<S> further , the asynchronous ones in the array with respect to the main sequentially synchronized cluster organize themselves to form clusters before they achieve synchronization with the main cluster . </S>",
    "<S> we have confirmed these results by estimating instantaneous phases including phase difference , average phase , average frequency , frequency ratio and their differences from suitably transformed phase coherent attractors after using a nonlinear transformation of the original non - phase - coherent attractors . </S>",
    "<S> the results are further corroborated using two other independent approaches based on recurrence analysis and the concept of localized sets from the original non - phase - coherent attractors directly without explicitly introducing the measure of phase . </S>"
