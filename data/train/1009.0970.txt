    "to develop a universal statistical mechanics for nonequilibrium steady states ( ness ) is a major remaining challenge in theoretical physics .",
    "it has been expected since the early days in the research that to pin down a physically natural entropy ( or free energy ) can be a crucial step in such a project .",
    "it should be realized , however , that the entropy in equilibrium systems plays several essentially different roles ; it is a thermodynamic function whose derivatives correspond to physically observable quantities , it is a quantitative measure of which adiabatic process is possible and which is not , it is also a large deviation functional governing the fluctuation of physical quantities .",
    "there is a possibility that this `` degeneracy '' is an accident observed only in equilibrium states , and the degeneracy is immediately lifted when one goes out of equilibrium .",
    "if this is the case we shall encounter more than one `` nonequilibrium entropies '' each of which characterizing different physical aspect of a ness . it will then be important to clarify what physics of ness is represented by which extension of entropy . among various promising attempts ,",
    "we refer to the phenomenological consideration in @xcite which tried to extend the notion of adiabatic accessibility , and recent explicit characterization of the large deviation functional in @xcite .    in our own attempt to extend the notion of entropy to ness @xcite",
    ", we have concentrated on the aspect which gave birth to the concept of entropy , namely , the clausius relation in thermodynamics .",
    "we started from a microscopic description of a heat conducting ness , and showed that a very natural generalization of the clausius relation , in which the heat is replaced with the `` excess heat '' , is indeed possible when the `` order of nonequilibrium '' @xmath0 is sufficiently small .",
    "this was a realization of the early phenomenological discussions in @xcite , and extension of the similar result in @xcite for models with gaussian thermostat .",
    "we also found that the microscopic representation of the entropy differs from the traditional gibbs - shannon form , and requires further symmetrization with respect to time - reversal transformation ( see below ) .    in the present paper , where we treat a class of markov processes describing heat conducting systems",
    ", we shall go one step further to show a new thermodynamic relation that has the same entropy as in @xcite , but contains an extra correction term which is intrinsically `` nonlinear nonequilibrium '' and has no counterpart in the original clausius relation .",
    "although one might worry that showing new relations with new nonlinear terms is a rather arbitrary uncontrolled attempt , we argue that _ this extension is mandatory and unique _ if we regard the extended clausius relation of @xcite as a starting point .",
    "moreover we shall see that to determine the entropy to the second order in the `` order of nonequilibrium '' @xmath0 , one may only use the naive extended clausius relation or must use the new relation with an extra term , depending on the operation under consideration .",
    "this fact suggests that _ there is a delicate but unavoidable `` twist '' in operational thermodynamics for ness_. we believe that one must understand the true nature of this twist before developing a satisfactory statistical theory of ness .      before discussing the details ,",

    "we examined how the clausius relation @xmath270 ( see ) , where @xmath206 is the total entropy production in the heat baths , and the corresponding gibbs - shannon expression can be extended to a ness .",
    "we have then found in @xcite that a very natural extension @xmath271 ( see ) was possible , where @xmath272 is the excess ( or `` renormalized '' ) version of entropy production in the baths .",
    "the excess entropy production @xmath272 characterizes the intrinsic entropy production caused by the operation of the outside agent .",
    "the extended relation is simple and looks natural until this point . in the present work",
    ", however , we found that if we use the same nonequilibrium entropy @xmath273 and try to determine this quantity with the precision of @xmath87 , we must sometime use the `` nonlinear nonequilibrium '' improvement @xmath274 ( see ) of the extended clausius relation , which includes a correlation between the work and the heat .",
    "although the new relation does not quite look like a thermodynamic relation , we found that this nonlinear improvement is mandatory and unique once we accept the naturalness of the extended clausius relation .",
    "furthermore , it was found that when one wants to determine the difference of entropies in two different ness with the precision of @xmath87 , one may use only the simpler extended clausius relation without a nonlinear term or must use the nonlinear relation , depending on the operational paths in the parameter space one takes .",
    "the discovery of this annoying but unavoidable `` twist '' in thermodynamics of ness as well as the new `` nonlinear nonequilibrium '' extended clausius relation is the main contribution of the present paper .      from a technical point of view",
    ", we have also made a nontrivial progress by developing a new method for deriving clausius - type thermodynamic relations for ness .",
    "the new method is much more straightforward and transparent than the one we used in the older work @xcite .",
    "the key strategy is to use the simple expression for the excess entropy production along with the representation of the probability distribution of ness .",
    "the new derivation made it clear that the previously derived extended clausius relation should be understood as a result within the linear response theory ( in a broad sense ) .",
    "it led us to the improved extended clausius relation which explicitly contains the `` nonlinear nonequilibrium '' term .",
    "it is of course straightforward to extend the present results to other classical systems exhibiting ness . in particular models with particle flows",
    "can be treated in the line of section  6 of @xcite .",
    "very recently the extended clausius relation was derived in a quantum system by extending the present method @xcite .",
    "it was found that the nonequilibrium entropy is expressed as the symmetrized von neumann entropy s_[_]= - , where @xmath275 is the density matrix for the ness and @xmath275 is the time reversal operator .",
    "we still do not know whether the `` nonlinear nonequilibrium '' relation can be extended to quantum systems or not .",
    "we have also argued that the symmetrized gibbs - shannon entropy is a natural entropy from the point of view of operational thermodynamics .",
    "more precisely if we stick on the natural prescription for `` renormalizing '' the divergent entropy production , this is the unique entropy to the second order in the `` order of nonequilibrium '' @xmath0 .",
    "note that our symmetrized entropy can be seen as the sum of the shannon entropy of @xmath85 and the relative entropy between @xmath85 and its time - reversal @xmath276 .",
    "therefore the symmetrized entropy certainly reflects the amount of breakdown of the time - reversal symmetry in a ness .",
    "unfortunately we still do not have any further interpretation of the new entropy .",
    "it would be quite exciting if one can read off deeper unknown structure of statistical mechanics for ness from this rather suggestive definition .",
    "a very important issue that must be investigated is to find possible relations between our entropy for ness and those derived through the studies of large deviation properties @xcite .",
    "although we do not see any direct connections for the moment , we believe that the thermodynamic - like construction in @xcite should be investigated in the light of what we have found .      there are still many issues in thermodynamics for ness which must be carefully studied .",
    "the situation about the second law , i.e. , the possible inequalities corresponding to the equalities or , is still rather complicated @xcite .",
    "we also note that it is possible to derive a formally exact results which correspond to our thermodynamic relations .",
    "for example , for any process in which the initial and the final states have the same reference inverse temperature , we can show that f_()-f_()= , [ e : ffull ] where @xmath277 is the time - reversal of any path @xmath66 , and @xmath278 . here",
    "@xmath279 is the nonequilibrium free energy ( to the full order in @xmath0 ) and coincides with the equilibrium free energy in equilibrium states .",
    "the relation reduces to ( symmetrized version of ) the jarzynski work relation @xcite when the initial and the final states are in equilibrium .",
    "one can define the nonequilibrium entropy to full order by using the standard formula s_():=\\{d^_()h_()-f_()}. it is found that this new entropy coincides with the symmetrized entropy to the precision of @xmath87 , but is not exactly the same as .",
    "see @xcite for details .",
    "the physical meaning of the suggestive result is still unclear to us .",
    "so far all of our results are derived using rather formal perturbation in the `` degree of nonequilibrium '' @xmath0 .",
    "the mathematically minded reader might ask if the results can be formulated as mathematically rigorous statements .",
    "if one reexamines our derivation , it will turn out that most of the procedures are mathematically sound in principle ( if one has suitable nice properties about convergence etc . ) and the key is whether the representations , can be made rigorous .",
    "we believe that these representations can be rigorously stated with some extra work if we make suitable assumptions on the markov process ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "such naive rigorous estimates , however , will have very small range of applicability .",
    "it is quite likely that we should take smaller and smaller @xmath0 as the system size gets larger .",
    "there is thus no hope of controlling thermodynamic limit with the current technique .",
    "it seems that we need a revolutionary new idea to resolve this issue and obtain meaningful results for large nonequilibrium systems .",
    "last but not least we wish to stress that both the extended clausius relation and its `` nonlinear nonequilibrium '' improvements and may be investigated experimentally in principle .",
