    "this variation affects the fraction of galaxies assigned to groups .",
    "it also affects the derived physical parameters   @xcite .",
    "@xcite discussed the sensitivity of group identification to the algorithm .",
    "a similar discussion is beyond the scope of this paper : all of the redshift survey data are publicly available for examination of these issues .",
    "here we provide lists of groups and group members to enable reproduction and extension of published results along with comparisons to other group catalogs .",
    "we include cross - references to our previous catalogs constructed from partial versions of the uzc and ssrs2 .",
    "we refer to the entire group catalog discussed in this paper as the _ uzc - ssrs2 group catalog _ which we abbreviate as usgc .",
    "section 2 reviews the redshift surveys and compares the uzc with the ssrs2 in the region of overlap .",
    "section 3 describes the group selection algorithm .",
    "section 4 discusses the homogeneity of the group catalog across the two underlying redshift surveys .",
    "we also examine the physical properties of the optically selected groups and compare them with the x - ray emitting subset . in section 5",
    "we conclude by comparing the usgc with similarly constructed catalogs based on distinct redshift surveys including the eso key programme @xcite and the lcrs @xcite .",
    "we derive the group catalog from the official distributions of the uzc ( http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/~falco/uzc/ ) and ssrs2 catalogs .",
    "we retrieve the ssrs2 from cds using vizier  @xcite . in the uzc catalog @xcite",
    "we use only the @xmath298% complete region limited by @xmath3 and @xmath4 in the north galactic cap and by @xmath5 in the south galactic cap .",
    "we discard the regions @xmath6 and @xmath7 in the southern galactic region because of the greater galactic absorption there @xcite .",
    "we consider only galaxies with @xmath8 km s@xmath9 .",
    "there are 13333 galaxies in the subset of the uzc catalog we analyze .",
    "the boundaries of the ssrs2 @xcite are @xmath10 and @xmath11 for ssrs2 south and @xmath12 and @xmath13 for ssrs2 north . here , too , we consider only galaxies with @xmath8 km s@xmath9 . the uzc and ssrs2 catalogs have slightly different magnitude systems , @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively .",
    "detailed discussions comparing @xmath14 and @xmath15 are in  @xcite and , more recently , in  @xcite .",
    "we use magnitudes as listed within the uzc and ssrs2 catalogs and apply the appropriate luminosity functions .    the ssrs2 and uzc overlap in the declination range @xmath16 and @xmath17 . in this region",
    "the uzc contains 472 galaxies , about twice as many galaxies as ssrs2 ( 260 galaxies ) . out of the 472 uzc galaxies in the overlap region ( or ) , 223 appear in both catalogs ( we call this set of galaxies u@xmath18  ; and the remaining 249 galaxies uzc galaxies make up the sample u@xmath19  )",
    ". we use the dss to verify that the uzc objects omitted from the ssrs2 are galaxies .",
    "we note that 37 ssrs2 galaxies have no uzc counterpart . of these 37 galaxies ,",
    "10 are very bright ngc galaxies also within uzc , but outside the half arcminute radius we search for uzc counterparts .",
    "these 10 galaxies are so bright and rare that they do not enter the magnitude comparison below .",
    "extending our search to a 6 arcmin radius does not yield counterparts for the remaining 27 galaxies .",
    "these 27 galaxies have apparent magnitudes spread throughout the ssrs2 range ; the sample of these galaxies is too small to draw any statistically interesting conclusions and they have little effect on the analysis below .",
    "the issue of completeness to the magnitude limit is of obvious importance for the normalization of the luminosity function and potentially for the determination of large - scale structure parameters .",
    "several authors have addressed the problem of the `` quality '' of @xmath20@xcite and of @xmath21@xcite .",
    "most of these authors use ccd photometry to calibrate either m@xmath22 or m@xmath23 .",
    "the task is difficult because the ccd photometric samples are limited and there are biases that can be introduced by the selection of the calibrating galaxies and by the choice of photometric techniques .",
    "it is perhaps not surprising that results are mostly discordant .",
    "given the lack of a `` final word '' on the two magnitude systems , it is worth investigating the difference between galaxy counts in the or .",
    "for the 223 galaxies in the u@xmath18  sample , we can compare @xmath21to @xmath20 directly ; this sample is similar in size to those in previous studies .",
    "of course , extension of the conclusions throughout the catalogs may not be warranted .",
    "the 223 u@xmath18  galaxies are brighter , on average , than the u@xmath19  galaxies : only 25 u@xmath18  galaxies are fainter than @xmath20= 15.20 ; 170 u@xmath19  galaxies are fainter than this limit .",
    "the distribution of @xmath20 in the or is very similar to the distribution of @xmath21 in the same region .",
    "the only significant difference occurs at the magnitudes fainter than @xmath20= 15.2 , more frequent among zwicky magnitudes .",
    "we suggest that @xmath21and @xmath20are not equivalent and that ssrs2 magnitudes are systematically brighter than uzc magnitudes , at least in the or .",
    "a least squares fit to the relationship @xmath20vs .",
    "@xmath21for u@xmath18  galaxies yields @xmath20= 0.78 @xmath21 + 3.16 .",
    "we use this relation to transform @xmath21into new magnitudes , @xmath24 , that can be compared directly to @xmath20 .",
    "the new magnitude limit is @xmath24= 15.25 .",
    "this brighter limit is the true limit that should be used for @xmath20when comparing ssrs2 and uzc magnitudes .",
    "remarkably , the magnitude limit @xmath20@xmath25 leaves 277 uzc galaxies in the or , very close count the 260 ssrs2 galaxies .",
    "furthermore , a ks test shows that the distributions of @xmath20and @xmath24have a probability greater than 98% of having been drawn from the same parent population .",
    "the results we obtain in the or may be valid everywhere else in the two surveys .",
    "in fact , the distributions of @xmath21and @xmath20within the or do not differ significantly from the magnitude distributions of the entire ssrs2 and uzc , respectively . if we set @xmath20= 15.25 as the new magnitude limit for the whole uzc , there are 4842 galaxies in the uzc ; there are 4824 ssrs2 galaxies .",
    "the solid angle of both regions of the sky is about 1.6 sr .",
    "thus the angular number densities of galaxies in the two surveys * coincide*. with the original fainter uzc limiting magnitude , the angular densities of the uzc and ssrs2 are 5200 galaxies sr@xmath9 and 3090 galaxies sr@xmath9 respectively .    our analysis of the or indicates that the uzc is a deeper survey than the ssrs2 and that a linear transformation is needed to make @xmath20and @xmath21comparable .",
    "we note that @xcite also analyze galaxies in common between zwicky s cgcg @xcite and ssrs2 .",
    "however , these authors focus on the u@xmath18  sample and ignore the presence of the large sample of u@xmath19  galaxies . without taking the u@xmath19  galaxies into account , and ignoring possible scale errors , they conclude that the average difference between @xmath21and @xmath20is of the order of 0.1 mag and that it can be ignored in the analyses of uzc and ssrs2 . because we can not verify that the results of our analysis of the or can be extended robustly over the entire uzc or ssrs2 , we do not attempt to unify selection functions but rather use the appropriate selection function in each survey .",
    "relative to their selection functions , groups in the two surveys have similar properties .",
    "indeed , we will show below that the number of groups _ relative to the underlying galaxy distribution _ and their main physical parameters are not significantly different within the uzc and ssrs2 surveys .",
    "if the transformation between @xmath20and @xmath21is correct throughout the catalog , some `` absolute '' properties of groups will differ somewhat in the approach we take here . for example",
    ", the average galaxy density within individual groups will be slightly different in the uzc and ssrs2 .",
    "we note , however , that other uncertainties than magnitude scale errors may dominate the identification of physically bound systems of galaxies and the determination of their masses .",
    "we do not know either the `` true '' distances of galaxies independent of their velocities and thus we do not have an estimate of the `` true '' spatial galaxy density .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to determine the ultimate underlying reason for the discrepancy between the two catalogs in the overlap region .",
    "it is also difficult to evaluate the propagation of these differences .",
    "progress will be made with large digital sky surveys , like 2mass and the on - going sdss , which will provide homogeneous and uniform ccd photometry and galaxy catalogs over large regions of the sky .",
    "here we discuss groups that have been used in a number of different analyses , we take the magnitudes in the two catalogs at face value and make no transformation .",
    "we use the uzc catalog in the overlap region .",
    "the difference in selection of galaxies within uzc and ssrs2 in the overlap region confuses the definition of groups at the border between the two surveys ; to avoid this problem we introduce a half degree gap between the two surveys . in conclusion ,",
    "the ssrs2 catalog we analyze consists of 4824 galaxies .",
    "figure 1a shows the distribution on the sky of the uzc and ssrs2 galaxies included in our analysis .",
    "we also plot ( large dots ) the position of the abell / aco clusters within the volume of the survey @xcite .",
    "we download andernach s updated electronic table from cds using vizier  @xcite .",
    "several abell / aco clusters lie just outside the border of the ssrs2 survey .",
    "we discuss the consequences of omission of these dense regions below .",
    "friends - of - friends algorithms ( fofa ) are now a standard approach to identifying systems of galaxies in a redshift survey .",
    "we apply the fofa originally proposed by @xcite as implemented by @xcite .",
    "the `` linking '' parameters @xmath26 and @xmath27 characterize the fofa search : for each galaxy in the catalog , the fofa identifies all other galaxies with a projected separation @xmath28 and a line - of - sight velocity difference    @xmath29    here , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the velocities of the two galaxies in the pair , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are their magnitudes , @xmath34 is their angular separation , and @xmath35 is the hubble constant .",

    "we conclude that 40 - 80% of the groups with five or more members are real and it is thus reasonable to use their properties to derive physical constraints on the nature of groups of galaxies .",
    "of course , the statistical reliability is substantially less for the 3 and 4 member groups .",

    "although the combined catalog covers 4.69 steradians , the sampling of the distribution of rich clusters of galaxies is limited to a few systems .",
    "for the ssrs2 which covers 1.56 steradians , the problem of the small number of systems with large velocity dispersion is most serious . in their study of the pairwise velocity dispersion for the cfa ( a subset of the uzc ) and",
    "ssrs2 south surveys , @xcite show that the dominant source of variance in @xmath73 from one subsample to another is shot noise contributed by dense virialized systems with large velocity dispersion .",
    "we thus expect to uncover similar limitations in our examination of the properties of groups . in section  [ num_gr ]",
    "we use the entire usgc catalog with three or more members to show that selection of groups is homogeneous across the two catalogs . in section  [ phys_prop ]",
    "we specialize to the higher confidence groups with more than five members to discuss the typical physical properties of the systems . in section  [ rass ]",
    "we show that the groups identified as extended x - ray sources have similar properties in both the uzc and in the ssrs2 .",
    "we conclude that , in spite of the differences between the underlying galaxy catalogs , the group catalog is reasonably homogeneous across the two surveys and provides a useful foundation for the study of properties of these systems at low redshift .",
    "table  [ counts ] lists the number of groups , members , non - members ( @xmath74 km s@xmath9  ) and galaxies within the usgc .",
    "we also list these quantities separately for the two surveys . from table",
    "[ counts ] , we conclude that the uzc projected angular density of groups , @xmath75 sr@xmath9 , is 1.4 times larger than the ssrs2 projected angular density , @xmath76 sr@xmath9 .",
    "the poisson uncertainty on the angular densities is of the order of 10 groups sr@xmath9 ; thus the difference between @xmath77 and @xmath78 is significant . in principle",
    ", the group - group correlation function increases the uncertainty relative to the poisson estimate .",
    "however , the amplitude of the angular group - group correlation function , @xmath79 mpc @xcite , is small compared with the size of the two surveys .",
    "therefore we expect that the effect of the the group - group correlation function on the uncertainty is negligible .",
    "our discussion of the uzc and ssrss2 magnitude scales in section 2 , indicates that the uzc is deeper than the ssrs2 and that a transformation between the two magnitude systems may be required . in the spirit of that discussion",
    ", we ask what happens to the relative surface number densities of groups if we simply drop uzc galaxies fainter than @xmath20= 15.25 and construct a catalog with @xmath68  @xmath80 3 .",
    "the group angular densities come into much better agreement , with 160 and 190 groups sr@xmath9 within uzc and ssrs2 respectively shifting the limiting magnitude from @xmath20= 15.25 to @xmath20= 15.30 yields exactly the same angular densities .",
    "although this apparently improved agreement is enticing , we have no clear justification for extrapoolating the results from the overlap region to the entire survey .",
    "the definition of survey boundaries may introduce bias in the survey .",
    "several aco clusters are just outside the boundary of ssrs2 ( see figure 1a ) . because the correlation length of the richest systems is much larger than for groups ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we consider the projected angular density of poor systems as a standard for comparing the two catalogs ( without any correction for possible differences in the magnitude systems ) . to estimate a `` richness '' , we set all groups at the same fiducial velocity @xmath42 = 1000 km s@xmath9 .",
    "we then use the relevant luminosity function normalized to the observed @xmath68  to compute the expected number of members with @xmath81 , the absolute magnitude corresponding to @xmath82 at @xmath42 .",

    "the result is insensitive to the exact choice of @xmath85 .",
    "this result suggests that , as in the analysis of @xcite , the richest systems account for the different group abundances within the uzc and ssrs2 .    to examine the homogeneity of the entire groups catalog further",

    "figure 2 shows that these ratios are approximately constant for the two surveys over a wide range of redshifts . at radial velocities",

    "the number of members relative to the galaxy population in the two surveys gives another measure of the similarity of the group catalogs . in principle , even if our test of the number of groups is satisfactory , the distribution of `` richness '' could differ in the two surveys .    to explore this issue",
    ", we consider the fraction of galaxies in groups .",
    "there is a total of 5242 member galaxies in the uzc groups , corresponding to a fraction @xmath96 of the total number of galaxies within @xmath90 km s @xmath91 km s@xmath9 . in the ssrs2 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "taken at face value , these fractions imply a difference between the ssrs2 and the uzc . from previous analyses of these catalogs",

    "shows the fraction of galaxies in groups , @xmath99 , in redshift bins ( we count all members of a group within the redshift bin containing the group mean velocity ) : from 2000 km s@xmath9 to 12000 km s@xmath9 @xmath100 ( thick solid line ) is increasingly larger than @xmath101 ( thin solid line ) .",

    "we conclude that groups within the ssrs2 and uzc are very similar for both their abundance and membership _ relative to the galaxy distribution_. if we exclude the richest systems , the fraction of galaxies identified as group members is the same at any redshift in both surveys .",
    "this result indicates that observational biases in the uzc relative to the ssrs2 do influence the identification of groups significantly .      to examine some of the physical properties of groups",
    ", we restrict the analysis to higher confidence systems with at least five observed members .",

    "table  [ grprop ] explores the variation in median physical parameters of the four poor / rich group subsamples ( excepting the small subsample of five ssrs2 rich groups ) .",
    "the median quantities for the poor subsamples are in excellent agreement with the full ssrs2 sample but differ from the total uzc . as expected , the rich uzc groups have a significantly larger median @xmath106 and @xmath110 .",
    "in contrast the median @xmath109 is remarkably consistent for all subsamples .",
    "we conclude that both the uzc and ssrs2 provide fair samples of poor systems .",
    "these systems have similar statistical properties in the two catalogs .",
    "a subsample of 61 groups in the usgc are extended x - ray sources detected in the rass @xcite .",
    "these groups are an important subset because the x - ray emission from gas presumably held in the potential well of the group guarantees that these groups are real physical systems .",
    "it is therefore interesting to compare their physical parameters to those for all groups in the catalog . of the 61 groups , 16 are within ssrs2 and 45 within uzc .",
    "therefore about @xmath113 15% of the groups in both samples are detected in the rass . among the x - ray emitting groups ,",
    "41 are poor according to the definition in section  [ phys_prop ] .",
    "table  [ grprop ] lists the physical parameters of the entire x - ray - emitting subsample .",
    "it is not surprising that median @xmath106 is intermediate between the rich and poor subsamples .",
    "the x - ray detected groups are systematically more massive than the typical system in the poor groups catalog .",
    "one concern is that this difference is simply a selection effect ; the x - ray identification might pick out more distant , richer groups .",
    "however , a ks test demonstrates that the velocity distribution of the poor groups detected in the x - ray poor groups is consistent with the entire poor usgc sample .",
    "this consistency is reassuring ; it indicates that the sample of poor groups with five or more members provides a foundation for the assessment of the physical properties of these systems and their member galaxies .",
    "the uzc and ssrs2 redshift surveys provide the basis for the usgc catalog which covers 4.69 steradians to 12000 km s@xmath9  .",
    "the fofa identifies a homogeneous set of 411 systems with more than five observed members . for completeness and for verification of the uniformity of the catalog",
    "we include all 1168 groups with 3 or more members .    for poor systems in the first three quartiles of the `` richness '' distribution , the surface number density of groups , the fraction of galaxies in groups , and the properties of groups are essentially the same for both the uzc and for the ssrs2 . in the upper quartile ,",
    "the catalogs differ : only the uzc contains a substantial number of these systems . as in @xcite",
    "we attribute this difference to shot noise in the sampling of the most massive systems in the smaller ssrs2 survey .",
    "both the uzc and the ssrs2 appear to be large enough to yield a fair sample of poor systems .",
    "the uzc and ssrs2 catalogs overlap in a region which covers @xmath114 sterad . in this region ,",
    "the uzc contains almost twice as many galaxies than ssrs2 .",
    "we obtain a linear transformation between @xmath20and @xmath21for galaxies that have both magnitudes .",
    "the new @xmath24is directly comparable to @xmath20 , and its faintest value is @xmath24= 15.25 .",
    "cutting the uzc at this shallower limit brings the uzc and ssrs2 catalogs into remarkable agreement in the overlap region .",
    "if we extend the limit @xmath20= 15.25 to the whole uzc , the global angular number densities of galaxies in the uzc and ssrs2 become comparable . the angular number density of groups in the shallower uzc catalog is essentially the same as for the ssrs2 .",
    "however , the main physical properties of groups do not change with re - identification within the shallower uzc or within ssrs2 using @xmath24instead of @xmath21 . in these modified catalogs",
    "it remains true that the uzc has a larger number of rich , high velocity systems than ssrs2 and that the @xmath115distributions of `` poor '' groups in the two surveys are likely to be drawn from the same parent distribution .",
    "extended x - ray emission associated with a subset of the usgc with more than five observed members provided reassurance that a large fraction of the systems we identify are true physical associations .",
    "statistical comparison of the x - ray and optical selection suggests that at least 40% of the groups we identify have x - ray properties similar to the rass sample .",
    "geometric analyses of a portion of the uzc suggest that @xmath116 of the groups are true physical systems .",
    "comparison with n - body simulations confirm this upper limit .",
    "@xcite used the same procedure we apply here to derive a group catalog from a deeper redshift survey of an independent region , the eso slice project ( esp ) .",
    "the esp group catalog includes a remarkably similar fraction of the galaxies in the redshift survey .",
    "furthermore , the median velocity dispersion of groups with five or more members is 272 km s@xmath9  with an interquartile range of ( 178 , 379 ) km s@xmath9  essentially the same as the comparable usgc sample with a median velocity dispersion of 264 km s@xmath9  and an interquartile range of ( 150 , 407 ) km s@xmath9  .",
    "other physical properties of the groups in this deeper catalog are also similar to those for the usgc .",
    "@xcite compare the properties of groups derived from the las campanas redshift survey ( * ? ?",
    "* lcrs ; ) with a broad range of catalogs including the subset of the usgc discussed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite conclude that the properties of their groups at median redshift @xmath117 are similar to the systems in the nearby samples .",
    "groups have traditionally provided a basis for estimating the mean mass density of the universe .",
    "now there are better methods of approaching this issue  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the existence of algorithms which produce uniform catalogs of systems , many of which are true physical associations , is a basis for exploration of groups as environments for galaxy evolution and for investigation of groups as tracers of large - scale structure in the universe .",
    "the usgc provides an extensive low redshift baseline for these studies .",
    "we thank antonaldo diaferio , scott kenyon , michael kurtz , and andisheh mahdavi for discussions and inspiration to complete the catalog .",
