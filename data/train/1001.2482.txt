    "in many materials it is the strong coupling of electronic and lattice degrees of freedom that determines the charge transport or the optical properties  @xcite . a basic effect is the renormalization of the charge carrier mass  @xcite .",
    "the mass renormalization is especially large in materials with a short - ranged interaction of electrons with optical phonons , as in molecular crystals or the colossal magnetoresistive manganites  @xcite . in such materials",
    "it happens that charge carriers , which otherwise resemble free electrons apart from a certain mass renormalization , give way to a kind of new quasiparticle with entirely different properties , the holstein polaron  @xcite .",
    "the mass of holstein polarons can exceed that of a bloch electron by several orders of magnitude , and may thus explain a low conductivity or thermally activated transport  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , polarons have specific optical signatures  @xcite .    from early work",
    "we understand the fundamental mechanism of polaron formation very well in two opposite cases : in the antiadiabatic regime of large phonon frequencies , where strong coupling perturbation theory provides the picture of a lang - firsov polaron  @xcite , and in the strict adiabatic limit of static oscillators , where the electron and phonon wavefunctions factor  @xcite .",
    "much analytical and numerical work has been performed to extend our understanding to finite phonon frequencies and the intermediate regime , including extended variational approaches  @xcite , exact diagonalization ( ed )  @xcite , density matrix renormalization group  @xcite , quantum monte carlo  @xcite , and different perturbative or approximate schemes  @xcite .",
    "numerical calculations provide reliable data for a wide range of phonon frequencies and coupling strengths , against which any discussion of holstein polarons must be checked ( for a recent review , see e.g.  refs .  ) .",
    "it is however very difficult to perform comparable calculations for small phonon frequencies , since the increasing number of phonon excitations poses a severe restriction on any , even large - scale , numerics .",
    "so far this prevented a thorough study of the experimentally most relevant adiabatic regime , in particular of large and heavy polarons as predicted by adiabatic approximations for one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems .",
    "also , numerical data for optical or transport properties are scarce  @xcite .    in the present contribution",
    "we use a new numerical technique to extend previous studies deep into the adiabatic regime .",
    "the key idea is an improved construction of phonon states that allows for the simultaneous representation of small and large oscillator shifts with few elements in a hilbert space .",
    "the construction overcomes the problem that the number of oscillator energy eigenstates needed grows fast at small frequency .",
    "we combine this construction with the phonon state selection in variational exact diagonalization ( ved )  @xcite . based on this method we present here",
    "results for phonon frequencies down to a hundredth of the electron transfer integral and still at large coupling , extending the frequency range accessed in previous studies by more than one order of magnitude .",

    "can now be assessed .",
    "this includes the question which properties of the static limit remain at small but finite phonon frequencies , and how the limit itself is approached . to our knowledge",

    "the sums run over all lattice sites @xmath5 , with the vectors @xmath6 along the lattice axes .",
    "the holstein model has three parameters : the electron transfer integral ( or hopping matrix element ) @xmath7 , the phonon frequency @xmath8 , and a third parameter @xmath9 , @xmath10 , or @xmath11 specifying the electron - phonon coupling strength . in the following",
    "we give all numerical values with the hopping matrix element as the unit of energy , so that @xmath12 .",
    "all results are for a single electron at zero temperature .",
    "our calculations for the holstein model are performed with standard ed methods , such as the lanczos algorithm and the kernel polynomial method  @xcite .",
    "the fundamental task is the construction of an appropriate subspace of the complete infinite hilbert space of the single fermionic and many bosonic degrees of freedom of the hamiltonian  . a very efficient construction is provided by ved , which achieves extreme accuracy not only for the polaron groundstate , especially in the regime of intermediate coupling and phonon frequency  @xcite , but also for models with different types of fermion - boson coupling  @xcite .",
    "ved is based on an increasing sequence of subspaces of the complete hilbert space .",
    "a certain subspace contains all basis states that are produced through a given number @xmath13 of applications of the hamiltonian to the phonon vacuum , that is either by excitation of a phonon or an electron move .",
    "for example , it contains the state with @xmath13 phonons at the electron position , and the one with a single phonon @xmath14 lattice sites away from the electron .",
    "the number of elements in the subspaces grow only by a factor close to @xmath15 as @xmath13 increases by @xmath16 , and already small subspaces provide a good approximation of the true groundstate .",
    "all quantities , e.g. variational estimates of the groundstate energy , can be improved by increasing @xmath13 until convergence .",
    "the main restriction of the ved construction , common to most ed studies , is the large number of phonons at large couplings or small phonon frequencies . to overcome this restriction",
    "we will replace the standard fock basis with a more general construction . for a single harmonic oscillator ( everything generalizes immediately to multiple oscillators at different lattice sites ) the fock states with fixed boson number are the states @xmath17 .",
    "if a force , say @xmath18 , is applied the average number of bosons in the groundstate is given by @xmath11 .",
    "the larger @xmath9 or the smaller @xmath8 , the more bosons are needed to account for the oscillator elongation @xmath19 . on the other hand , we know that the groundstate is simply a coherent state @xmath20 , obtained from the vacuum with the shift operator @xmath21 .    in the polaron problem",
    "the effective force exerted on the oscillator , hence its state , changes as the electron moves .",

    "the optimal parameter @xmath29 can be determined variationally through minimization of the groundstate energy . for our purposes ,",
    "the choice @xmath30 is close to optimal , and was used in all calculations . for larger coupling @xmath31 ,",
    "hence larger optimal @xmath29 , the sos account for larger oscillator elongations .",
    "conversely , if the maximal number of states @xmath13 per oscillator is increased and @xmath29 decreases , the sos sample ever finer details of the oscillator wavefunctions .",
    "in fact , since in our calculations always @xmath32 , the states @xmath33 overlap in position space , and the sos do not resemble coherent states after orthogonalization .",
    "instead they interpolate between ` quantum ' fock states generated by @xmath34 and ` classical ' coherent states generated by @xmath35 .",
    "note that a construction with a fixed small number of coherent states would have to fail : for small @xmath8 it is not possible to represent all oscillator wavefunctions  with small width and different positions  if only few states are available .",
    "for the sos the necessary increase in accuracy is accomplished by construction if @xmath13 grows .    for the polaron problem , the gain in efficiency obtained using sos is demonstrated in tab .",

    "the validity of our implementation was checked against calculations from diagrammatic quantum monte carlo ( data for the 3d polaron mass at @xmath40 were provided by a.  s.  mishchenko ) .",
    "coherent states have been used in variational  @xcite and numerical approaches to the holstein model  @xcite .",
    "the latter two references describe a construction similar to ours .",

    "such a polaron is always a very small particle , with strong correlations between electron and phonon dynamics .",
    "we therefore expect that , with increasing coupling , the kinetic energy and drude weight simultaneously become small as the polaron gets less mobile , and that at the same time the optical conductivity decreases since a very small object is less susceptible to optical fields . as this expectation",

    "[ fig : sumrule ] ( right bottom panel ) , we can say that in this type of polaron the electron is dressed with phonons , resulting in a new polaronic quasiparticle emerging as a joint electron - phonon entity .",
    "the physics is essentially different in the adiabatic regime of heavy but large polarons .",
    "for such adiabatic polarons electron and phonon dynamics partially decouple , anticipating the static limit where the electron moves in the rigid phonon configuration of the lattice displacement . that there translational symmetry is broken and the polaron has infinite mass is equivalent to the fact that states of a static oscillator with different position , and vanishing width , have zero overlap . at small but finite @xmath8 the translated phonon configurations have small overlap , and the polaron acquires a finite but eventually large mass even for large radius . that the radius remains large means that in contrast to the antiadiabatic situation the mass increase is not so much a result of dressing the electron with phonons , but rather of the immobility of the extended lattice displacement as a whole .",

    "[ fig : sumrule ] ( left top panel ) .",
    "now , even if the drude weight close to zero indicates the immobility of the polaron , the kinetic energy and optical conductivity remain large .",
    "the opposite behavior of these quantities can be attributed to the different constituents of the polaron .",
    "the drude weight is small since the phonon part suppresses motion of the whole polaron , but the kinetic energy is large due to the electron motion relative to the phonons .",
    "transitions between different electronic states in the almost rigid phonon background give a large contribution to the optical conductivity .",
    "if electron and phonon motion decouple in this way an adiabatic polaron can be understood as a quasiparticle only with certain restrictions .",
    "the polaron is rather a composite electron - phonon object , where electron and phonons influence each other but remain separable , instead of that joint electron - phonon entity found in the antiadiabatic regime where the electron and the phonons lose their independence in favor of a new quasiparticle .",

    "the basic mechanism for optical absorption has changed .",
    "it is now dominated by electronic transitions in the potential well generated by the lattice displacement . of course , a phonon admixture is present for any finite @xmath8 . only in the static limit",
    "the phonon configuration remains unchanged during an electronic transition , and the franck - condon effect is fully realized .    to summarize ,",
    "the change in the optical conductivity with phonon frequency reflects very clearly the two different time scales realized in the polaron problem . depending on whether the electron or the phonons set the fastest time scale , we observe different physics . in the antiadiabatic regime we find a well - defined polaronic quasiparticle whose behavior is governed by local phonon excitations dressing the electron and the arising strong correlations between electron and phonon dynamics . or we find , in the adiabatic regime , an electron moving in a phononic background whose properties depend only on the average electron motion , while stronger correlations are missing .",
    "these differences and their consequences for polaron transport and dynamics have been studied here in terms of the optical conductivity and f - sum rule .",
    "a description of lattice polaron formation requires the treatment of the two different time - scales of electron and phonon dynamics , their mutual influence and accompanying renormalization , and the non - trivial quantum correlations that develop .",

    "+ ( iv ) small and large polarons have significantly different transport and optical properties .",
    "a large and heavy polaron is characterized through a small drude weight but large optical absorption .",
    "a small and heavy polaron has small drude weight and small optical absorption .",
    "+ ( v ) the small - polaron approximation for the optical conductivity is strictly valid only for very large phonon frequencies , while in general pronounced structures distort the gaussian envelope .",
    "the overall shape of the envelope however remains comparable also for smaller phonon frequencies .",
    "these findings suggest certain physical interpretations .",
    "first , with all necessary caution , it may make sense to think of a self - trapping transition in 3d even at finite phonon frequency .",
    "there is nothing comparable in 1d .",
    "second , the notion of an itinerant polaronic quasiparticle is to be used only with care : the nature of the quasiparticle differs at large and small phonon frequency ( cf .",
    "[ sec : opt ] ) .",
    "third , holstein polarons tend to be small objects .",
    "this should largely prevent polaron dissociation , which may occur in a kind of polaronic mott transition if the phonon clouds overlap at finite polaron density .",
    "it also prevents instabilities in anisotropic systems with a preferred direction of motion , where only the large adiabatic quasi-1d polarons are destabilized by electron hopping perpendicular to this direction  @xcite .    in principle , our results allow for direct comparison with , and hence validation of , approximate polaron theories . we have not tried to do so here , since we want our results to tell their own tale .",
    "our discussion should have shown that the numerical data itself do not prevent a physical interpretation .",
    "but the interpretation adheres to direct terms  the polaron is heavy or light , small or large  , and simple pictures  such as a phonon - dressed electron vs. an electron moving in the potential generated by the lattice displacement .",
    "there is no necessity to invoke complicated constructions which do not find their counterpart in the few quantities truly characterizing the polaron .",
    "the present problem , i.e. the single holstein polaron at zero temperature , is treated here exhaustively . of course , it is possible to go to even smaller phonon frequencies , larger couplings or other more extreme situations , but new physical behavior will not occur .",
    "there are however many other topics in polaron physics that remain unsettled . with a few singular exceptions none of them",
    "have been accessed with the same rigor as the present problem . within the framework of the holstein model , transport at finite temperature and collective effects at finite density",
    "are probably the two most important issues . proceeding beyond the holstein model ,",
    "in particular on trying to extend the discussion to polarons in novel materials such as graphene  @xcite , new questions emerge .",
    "these include polaron formation in the presence of impurities  @xcite and disorder  @xcite , the influence of phonon dispersion , of different types of electron - phonon coupling , of lattice geometry , anisotropy  @xcite or confinement , or the dynamics of polaron formation  @xcite out of equilibrium , realized e.g. in quantum dots or molecular aggregates .",
    "some of these questions are directly connected with the present study .",
    "does , e.g. , longer - ranged electron - phonon interaction favor the formation of large and heavy polarons ?",
    "although the polaron becomes larger then , its mass will decrease , and the existence of a large heavy polaron with corresponding optical signatures may crucially depend on a number of material parameters .",
    "the classification of these parameters and of their influence on polaron properties is central to giving studies such as the present one relevance beyond the rigorous treatment of a model . to make such investigations possible",
    "is certainly the motivation to develop powerful high - precision numerics for the polaron problem , while their application provides us with the necessary information to understand real polarons and the models to describe them .",

    "the sos @xmath24 , with @xmath137 , form a hilbert space basis for a single harmonic oscillator . for @xmath138 , they are characterized through two properties : ( i ) orthonormality @xmath139 , ( ii ) the @xmath28-th sos is a linear combination @xmath140 of the @xmath141 coherent states @xmath142 , @xmath143 .",
    "in particular , @xmath144 .",
    "these conditions imply that the sos can be constructed through gram - schmidt - orthogonalization of the equally spaced coherent states @xmath142 , in the order of increasing @xmath145 . moreover , the operator @xmath146 is given by a upper triangular matrix in the sos basis .",
    "it is possible to obtain explicit expressions for the coefficients @xmath147^{1/2 } } \\ , \\genfrac{[}{]}{0pt}{}{n}{m}_{\\alpha^2 } \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath148 and the q - binomials @xmath149_q$ ] ( for a definition , see e.g. ref .  )",
    "are polynomials in @xmath150 .",
    "all relevant matrix elements can also be computed with a numerical gram - schmidt procedure .",
    "the above definition applies to all @xmath138 .",
    "the limit @xmath26 exists , and the sos reproduce the fock states in this limit . in the opposite limit @xmath151 , they become asymptotically equal to the coherent states @xmath142 , since the overlap between different coherent states is small .    from the explicit expressions for @xmath152 we find that @xmath153 . for real @xmath29",
    ", it follows that the oscillator elongation in the @xmath28-th sos is given by @xmath154 .",
    "thus , sos for @xmath22 ( @xmath155 ) should be used for states with positive ( negative ) elongation .    to quantify the benefit of sos over fock states for groundstate calculations , we consider a shifted oscillator with hamiltonian @xmath156 the groundstate of this hamiltonian , with energy @xmath157 , is a coherent state @xmath158 , which contains @xmath58 bosons on average . in a numerical calculation",
    "an approximate groundstate of @xmath159 is calculated in a truncated hilbert space , e.g. consisting of the first @xmath160 fock states . the corresponding error in the groundstate energy",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sos ] . as expected , the error is large when @xmath161 .",
    "using sos instead of fock states , the error depends on @xmath29 . in the present example , the error is zero for @xmath162 , since the coherent state @xmath158 is a linear combination of the first two sos . for a meaningful error estimate we therefore fix @xmath163 for the maximal",
    "@xmath164 considered .",
    "the virtue of the sos is that the error is small also for all intermediate @xmath165 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sos ] ) .",
    "note that the error drops to zero at those values of @xmath31 for which the true groundstate is contained in the truncated hilbert space spanned by the @xmath160 sos .",
    "we also see how the sos prefer positive elongations for @xmath22 , and the error becomes large if @xmath29 and @xmath31 have opposite sign . in a real calculation",
    ", the variational determination of the parameter @xmath29 would prevent this situation . for the holstein model  , only positive elongations occurs and always @xmath22 .",
    "note that in the worst case the optimal @xmath29 is zero , and the fock states are recovered .",
    "therefore , the introduction of sos can only improve groundstate results obtained with fock states . in the given example ,",
    "the error with @xmath166 sos is one order of magnitude smaller than that with @xmath167 fock states .",
    "the sos construction can be modified in various ways .",
    "for example , if oscillator states with large positive and negative elongations should be represented , one can apply a global shift @xmath168 , constructing the sos from coherent states @xmath169 .",
    "the additional parameter @xmath170 provides the necessary freedom to deal with such a situation .",
    "we introduced the sos mainly for oscillator groundstates .",
    "they also work for excited states , but we should distinguish two cases .",
    "first , for a single excited state , the sos with variational determination of @xmath29 will succeed and can provide us with good results even in cases when fock states fail . or , second , we may need all excited states at once , such as in the calculation of the optical conductivity @xmath120 . in this case , the fundamental problem of any ed calculation is that a finite hilbert space does not allow for the representation of infinitely many excited states .",
    "no basis construction can overcome this obstruction .",
    "it is however possible to include sufficiently many states in the hilbert space , such that the hilbert space truncation shows up only through a kind of numerical noise , while the relevant physical structures are resolved .",
    "for example , the equally spaced peaks in the lower right panel in fig .  [ fig : optics ] are physically meaningful , while the tiny spikes in the middle right panel are numerical noise .",
    "the sos construction guarantees the correct envelope and shape of @xmath120 .",
    "for example , in the middle left panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : optics ] , a calculation with fock states instead of sos results in a curve that is shifted to smaller energies .",
    "again , the fock states can not account for the substantial oscillator elongation in the groundstate and excited states in the adiabatic regime . to summarize , integrated or averaged properties of excited states",
    "are obtained correctly with sos , but not with fock states . for correct spectral properties , e.g. peak positions at high resolution , additional effort is needed in any case ."
