    "<S> we present and discuss a variance - reduced stochastic particle method for simulating the relaxation - time model of the boltzmann transport equation . </S>",
    "<S> the present paper focuses on the dilute gas case , although the method is expected to directly extend to all fields ( carriers ) for which the relaxation - time approximation is reasonable . </S>",
    "<S> the variance reduction , achieved by simulating only the deviation from equilibrium , results in a significant computational efficiency advantage compared to traditional stochastic particle methods in the limit of small deviation from equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> more specifically , the proposed method can efficiently simulate arbitrarily small deviations from equilibrium at a computational cost that is independent of the deviation from equilibrium , which is in sharp contrast to traditional particle methods .    the boltzmann transport equation @xmath0 _ { \\textrm{coll}}}}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the single - particle distribution function @xcite , @xmath2 _ { \\textrm{coll}}}}$ ] denotes the collision operator , @xmath3 is the acceleration due to an external field , @xmath4 is the position vector in physical space , @xmath5 is the molecular velocity vector , and @xmath6 is time , is used to describe ( under appropriate conditions ) transport processes in a wide variety of fields @xcite including dilute gas flow @xcite , phonon @xcite , electron @xcite , neutron @xcite and photon transport @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , it has received renewed attention in connection to micro- and nano - scale science and technology where transport at lengthscales of the order of , or smaller than , the carrier mean free path is frequently considered ( e.g. nanoscale solid - state heat transfer @xcite )    numerical solution of the boltzmann equation remains a formidable task due to the complexity associated with the collision operator and the high dimensionality of the distribution function . </S>",
    "<S> both these features have contributed to the prevalence of particle solution methods , which are typically able to simulate the collision operator through simple and physically intuitive stochastic processes while employing importance sampling , which reduces computational cost and memory usage @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another contributing factor to the prevalence of particle schemes is their natural treatment of the advection operator , which results in a numerical method that can easily handle and accurately capture traveling discontinuities in the distribution function @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an example of a particle method is the direct simulation monte carlo ( dsmc ) @xcite which has become the prevalent simulation method for dilute gas flow .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the most important disadvantages of particle methods for solving the boltzmann equation derives from their reliance on statistical averaging for extracting field quantities from particle data . </S>",
    "<S> when simulating processes close to equilibrium , thermal noise typically exceeds the available signal . </S>",
    "<S> when coupled with the slow convergence of statistical sampling ( statistical error decreases with the square root of the number of samples ) , this often leads to computationally intractable problems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , to resolve a flow speed of the order of 1 m / s to 1% statistical uncertainty in a dilute gas , on the order of @xmath7 independent samples are needed @xcite .    in a recent paper , baker and hadjiconstantinou </S>",
    "<S> have shown @xcite that this rather severe limitation can be overcome with a form of variance reduction achieved by simulating only the deviation from equilibrium . by adopting this approach </S>",
    "<S> , it is possible to construct monte carlo simulation methods that can capture arbitrarily small deviations from equilibrium at a computational cost that is independent of the magnitude of this deviation . </S>",
    "<S> this is in sharp contrast to regular monte carlo methods , such as dsmc , whose computational cost for the same signal - to - noise ratio increases _ sharply _ @xcite as the deviation from equilibrium decreases .    </S>",
    "<S> the work in refs @xcite focused on the boltzmann equation for hard spheres and the associated hard - sphere collision operator . </S>",
    "<S> the complexity associated with this collision operator , as well as others in related fields , has prompted scientists to search for simplified models ; one particularly popular model is the relaxation - time approximation @xcite @xmath8 _ { \\textrm{coll}}}}=-\\frac{1}{\\tau } \\left(f - f^{loc}\\right)\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the _ local equilibrium _ </S>",
    "<S> distribution function and @xmath10 is a relaxation time . despite the approximation involved , this collision model has enjoyed widespread application in a variety of disciplines concerned with transport processes @xcite .    in response to this widespread use , </S>",
    "<S> in the present paper , we present a variance - reduced particle method for simulating the boltzmann equation under the relaxation - time approximation . to focus the discussion </S>",
    "<S> , we specialize our treatment to the dilute gas case ; however , we hope that this exposition can serve as a prototype for development of similar techniques in all fields where the relaxation - time approximation is applicable . within the rarefied gas dynamics literature </S>",
    "<S> , the relaxation - time approximation is known as the bgk model @xcite .    in the interest of simplicity , in the present paper </S>",
    "<S> we assume @xmath11 and that no external forces are present . the first assumption can be easily relaxed , as discussed below . </S>",
    "<S> external fields also require relatively straightforward modifications to the algorithm presented below .    </S>",
    "<S> as discussed in previous work @xcite , a variance - reduced formulation is obtained by simulating only the deviation @xmath12 from an _ arbitrary _ , but judiciously chosen , underlying equilibrium distribution @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , computational particles represent the deviation from equilibrium and , as a result , they may be positive or negative , depending on the sign of the deviation from equilibrium at the location in phase space where they reside . as in other particle schemes </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , in the interest of computational efficiency , each _ computational _ deviational particle represents an _ effective number _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath14 of physical deviational particles .    </S>",
    "<S> a dilute gas in equilibrium is described by a maxwell - boltzmann distribution , leading to a local equilibrium distribution @xmath15 that is parametrized by the local number density @xmath16 , the local flow velocity @xmath17 , and the most probable speed @xmath18 based on local temperature @xmath19 . here </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath20 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath21 is the molecular mass . in the work that follows </S>",
    "<S> , the underlying equilibrium distribution ( @xmath13 ) will be identified with absolute equilibrium @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a reference ( equilibrium ) number density and @xmath24 is the most probable molecular speed based on the reference temperature @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> this choice provides a reasonable balance between generality , computational efficiency and simplicity . </S>",
    "<S> other choices are of course possible and , depending on the problem , perhaps more efficient . </S>",
    "<S> however , care needs to be taken if a spatially varying or time dependent underlying equilibrium distribution is chosen since this results in a more complex algorithm @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> particle methods typically solve the boltzmann equation by applying a splitting scheme , in which molecular motion is simulated as a series of collisionless advection and collision steps of length @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> in such a scheme , the collisionless advection step integrates @xmath27 by simply advecting particles for a timestep @xmath26 , while the collision step integrates @xmath28 _ { \\textrm{coll}}}}\\label{collision}\\ ] ] by changing the distribution by an amount @xmath2 _ { \\textrm{coll}}}}({\\bf r},{\\bf c},t)\\delta t$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> spatial discretization is introduced by treating collisions as spatially homogeneous within ( small ) computational cells of volume @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> our approach retains this basic structure ; the particular form of these steps can be summarized as follows .    </S>",
    "<S> _ advection step : _ it can be easily verified that when the underlying equilibrium distribution is not a function of space or time , as is the case here , the advection step for deviational particles is identical to that of physical particles [ i.e. @xmath30 is also governed by equation ( [ advection ] ) during the advection step ] . </S>",
    "<S> boundary condition implementation , however , differs somewhat because the mass flux to boundaries is now split into a deviational contribution and an equilibrium contribution . </S>",
    "<S> a more extensive discussion , as well as algorithmic details can be found in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> _ collision step : _ the variance - reduced form of ( [ collision ] ) can be written as @xmath8 _ { \\textrm{coll}}}}= \\frac{1}{\\tau } \\left(f^{loc}-f\\right)-\\frac{1}{\\tau } f^d \\label{start}\\ ] ] _ within each computational cell _ we integrate equation ( [ start ] ) using a two - part process . </S>",
    "<S> this integration requires local ( cell ) values of various quantities , denoted here by hats , which are updated every timestep by sampling the instantaneous state of the gas .    in the first part we remove a random sample of particles by deleting particles with probability @xmath31 to satisfy @xmath32 in our implementation , this </S>",
    "<S> is achieved through an acceptance - rejection process which can also treat the case @xmath33 .    in the second part </S>",
    "<S> , we create a set of positive and negative particles ( using an acceptance - rejection process ) to satisfy @xmath34\\ , \\delta t \\label{add}\\ ] ] this step can be achieved by the following procedure . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath35 be a ( positive ) value such that @xmath36 is negligible for @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is an @xmath39-norm . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , let @xmath40 bound @xmath41 from above </S>",
    "<S> . then , repeat @xmath42 times :    1 .   generate uniformly distributed , random velocity vectors @xmath43 with @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> 2 .   if @xmath45 , create a particle with velocity @xmath46 , at a randomly chosen position within the cell and sign @xmath47 $ ] . here </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath48 is a random number uniformly distributed on [ 0,1 ] .    to find @xmath49 we note that the number of particles ( of all velocities and signs ) that should be generated in a cell to obtain the proper change in the distribution function is @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the cell volume . </S>",
    "<S> the ( expected ) total number of particles ultimately generated by the above algorithm is @xmath52 by equating the two expressions we obtain @xmath53 .    we have verified the above algorithm using a variety of test cases ; some representative results are presented below . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ heat ] shows a comparison between numerical solution of the bgk model of the boltzmann equation @xcite and our simulation results for the heat flux , @xmath54 , between two parallel , infinite , fully - accommodating plates at slightly different temperatures ( @xmath25 and @xmath55 ) and a distance @xmath56 apart . </S>",
    "<S> the figure compares the heat flux normalized by the free - molecular ( ballistic ) value @xmath57 as a function of a knudsen number @xcite @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the equilibrium gas pressure . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement is excellent . </S>",
    "<S> the simulations used approximately 50,000 particles yielding a relative statistical uncertainty of less than 0.5% . </S>",
    "<S> these simulations were performed at @xmath60k , although as shown below , the cost is expected to be independent of the magnitude of @xmath61 in the limit of small deviation from equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> we also performed dsmc simulations of the bgk model using @xmath62k and otherwise identical discretization and sampling parameters ; @xmath62k was chosen as a compromise between best performance and a deviation from equilibrium that is small enough for the linearized conditions , and thus the benchmark results of @xcite , to be valid .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ poi ] shows a comparison between a numerical solution of the linearized bgk model of the boltzmann equation @xcite and our simulation results for pressure - driven flow ( for small pressure gradients ) . under linear conditions , </S>",
    "<S> pressure - driven flow can be described @xcite by @xmath63 _ { \\textrm{coll}}}}- \\kappa c_z f\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is the normalized pressure gradient ( here assumed to be in the @xmath65direction ) , and @xmath66 is the channel transverse direction . for @xmath67 </S>",
    "<S> , the term @xmath68 can be included in our formulation as a source of @xmath69 positive and an equal number of negative deviational physical . ] particles per unit volume drawn from the distribution @xmath70 for @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ poi ] shows the normalized flowrate @xmath73 as a function of @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the gas density and @xmath76 is the average flow velocity ( averaged across the channel width ) . </S>",
    "<S> excellent agreement is observed .    as stated above and shown in @xcite , this class of deviational methods exhibit statistical uncertainties that scale with the local deviation from equilibrium thus allowing the simulation of arbitrarily low deviations from equilibrium at a cost that is independent of this deviation . </S>",
    "<S> here we demonstrate this feature by studying the statistical uncertainty of the temperature in a problem involving heat transfer . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , figure [ fluct ] shows the relative statistical uncertainty in the temperature ( @xmath77 ) as a function of the normalized wall temperature difference @xmath78 in the heat transfer problem discussed above , for @xmath79 and @xmath80k ; in evaluating @xmath77 , the characteristic value for temperature was taken to be the difference @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> the standard deviation is measured from two computational cells in the middle of the computational domain , each containing approximately 950 particles . </S>",
    "<S> the figure shows that , for small @xmath81 , the relative statistical uncertainty remains independent of this quantity in sharp contrast to `` non - deviational '' methods . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the variance reduction achieved is such that significant computational savings are expected for @xmath82 .    </S>",
    "<S> the algorithm described above imposes no restrictions on the magnitude of @xmath30 , although it is expected that the deviational approach will be significantly more efficient than traditional approaches when @xmath30 is small . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath30 is sufficiently small for linearization to be appropriate , under some conditions , significant gains in computational efficiency can be achieved by taking the following into consideration . under linear conditions , for the present model , we can write @xmath83 \\label{lin}\\ ] ] where @xmath84 and @xmath85 </S>",
    "<S> . this representation can be very useful for improving the computational efficiency of update ( [ add ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> for example , for isothermal constant density flows , particles can be generated from a combination of a normal distribution and analytic inversion of the cumulative distribution function , which is significantly more efficient than acceptance - rejection . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , ( [ lin ] ) provides a means of obtaining tight bounds for @xmath86 and thus reducing the number of rejections if the acceptance - rejection route is followed .    </S>",
    "<S> we have presented an efficient variance - reduced particle method for solving the boltzmann equation in the relaxation - time approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the method combines simplicity with a number of desirable properties associated with particle methods , such as robust capture of traveling discontinuities in the distribution function and efficient collision operator evaluation using importance sampling @xcite , without the high relative statistical uncertainty associated with traditional particle methods in low - signal problems . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the method presented here can capture arbitrarily small deviations from equilibrium for constant computational cost . </S>",
    "<S> more sophisticated techniques with spatially variable underlying equilibrium distribution @xcite are expected to increase computational efficiency by reducing the number of deviational particles required to describe the local state of the gas . </S>",
    "<S> one such technique is described in @xcite . </S>"
