    "<S> we provide unified phenomenological description of magnetooptic effects being linear and quadratic in magnetization . </S>",

    "<S> we also express principal spectra analytically using modified kubo formula .    </S>",
    "<S> there is a vast number of physical phenomena proportional to quadratic form of magnetization . in case of dc transport phenomena , </S>",
    "<S> the most well - known examples are anisotropy magnetoresistance ( amr ) @xcite or longitudinal hall effect @xcite . within the magnetooptic community </S>",
    "<S> , the field of magnetooptic effects quadratic in magnetization is complicated by incredible number of nomenclature , being called cotton - mouton effect , voigt effect , quadratic magnetooptic kerr effect ( qmoke ) @xcite , magnetic linear birefringence , x - ray magnetic linear dichroism ( xmld ) @xcite , magnetic double refraction , magnetooptic orientation effect , magnetooptic anisotropy , hubert - schfer effect or magnetorefractive effect @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the nomenclature is not strictly defined , however it refers either to type of samples ( liquid , gas , solid state ) or it refers to experimental configurations of the setup ( namely detecting change of light intensity or detecting change of polarization state upon variation of magnetization direction ) . </S>",
    "<S> although those effects are usually not considered as single phenomena , they originate from equal parts of permittivity tensors ( i.e.  from equal symmetry breaking ) . </S>",
    "<S> notice , that recently new types of quadratic - in - magnetization effects arose , for example anisotropic magneto - thermopower @xcite in spin - caloritronics . within some generalization </S>",
    "<S> , one can expect that any magneto - transport linear in magnetization will have its quadratic - in - magnetization counterpart .    </S>",
    "<S> the first observation of magnetooptic effects quadratic in magnetization dates back more than century ago in works of kerr @xcite , majorana @xcite and cotton and moutton @xcite , where magnetic birefringence was observed in liquids and colloids . </S>",
    "<S> later , those quadratic magnetooptic response was observed in gases , solid state materials and obviously also in ferromagnetic materials . </S>",
    "<S> see large reviews of smolenskii _ et al _ @xcite and ferr , gehring @xcite from 80 s . </S>",
    "<S> the anisotropy of magnetooptic effects ( i.e. dependence of qmoke on crystal and field orientations ) was investigated for various systems . </S>",
    "<S> however , the investigation were mostly done for a single photon energy , for example fe @xcite or antiferromagnetic rbmnf@xmath1 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> buchmaier _ </S>",
    "<S> et al _ have even determined values of principal spectra ( namely values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) , however also only for a single photon energy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral investigations were rare , for example spectroscopy of qmoke for different orientations of ni surfaces by krinchik @xcite and parker @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of quadratic magnetooptic effects in x - ray photon energy range was rather independent on those in extended visible range . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray magnetic linear dichroism were theoretically predicted by thole and van  der  laan @xcite . due to experimental restrictions , </S>",
    "<S> the quadratic - in - magnetization effects in x - ray range were measured in absorption , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ dichroic effects @xcite and later in polarization , voigt effect @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> et al _ @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they showed that for the correct shape of the xmld spectra at l@xmath4 edges the exchange splitting of the core levels is necessary @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> later , with direct comparison with the experiment the angular dependence of the xmld of bcc fe shown that the role of the valence spin - orbit interaction is much weaker @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the simple model of kunes _ </S>",
    "<S> et al _ that accounts for the difference of the xmld spectra for the high symmetry crystal directions , _ et . </S>",
    "<S> al _ with magnetization along [ 001 ] and [ 111 ] axis showed that the origin is expressed as different weighted spin densities of @xmath5 and @xmath6 orbitals @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> shortly after , arenholz _ et . </S>",
    "<S> al _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite have shown that in case of cubic crystals having point symmetry , xmld along any quantization axis can be expressed as weighted sum of two fundamental spectra .    </S>",
    "<S> this approach was extended to tetragonal crystal field by laan _ </S>",
    "<S> et al _ , extending number of fundamental spectra to four , demonstrated on cofe@xmath7o@xmath8 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> krug _ </S>",
    "<S> et al _ @xcite have generalize this approach from xmld fundamental spectra to fundamental spectra of scattering form - factor @xmath9 , where imaginary part of @xmath9 corresponds to light absorption . </S>",
    "<S> later , havekort _ et al _ have expressed symmetry arguments also for other crystal symmetries @xcite . recently </S>",
    "<S> , the quadratic effects in magnetization like voigt in reflection or xmld were detected and theoretically explained also in the soft x - ray energy range , _ </S>",
    "<S> i. e. _ at the 3@xmath0 edges of transition metals @xcite .    from phenomenological point of view , </S>",
    "<S> all magnetooptic effects are described by conductivity @xmath10 , permittivity @xmath11 or scattering @xmath12 tensors , being simply convertible between each other . in following , </S>",
    "<S> we use tensor of permittivity , being mostly employed in optical community . from quantum - mechanical point of view , the fundamental part of the permittivity tensor is optical absorption , related to optical dispersion by kramers - kronig relations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the relations of magnetooptic response ( or in general to any magneto - transport ) to crystallographic orientation is given by symmetry arguments , predicting dependence of the permittivity tensor elements on magnetization direction for effects being independent , linear , quadratic , cubic etc in magnetization . in case of magnetooptic effects quadratic - in - magnetization </S>",
    "<S> , the form of such tensors can be found in works of birss @xcite , nye @xcite and bhagavantam @xcite and visnovsky @xcite , whose notation is used in this article . </S>",
    "<S> symmetry arguments predict , that the permittivity tensor is given by a weighted sum of constituent single dielectric tensor elements , where their weights are given solely by direction of magnetization .    in this article </S>",
    "<S> , we express principal spectra , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ the non - magnetic , linear and quadratic contributions in magnetization for permittivity tensors , from which the complete spectra of permittivity tensor can be obtained for any magnetization direction . </S>",
    "<S> then , we express principal spectra calculated from first principles of cubic material bcc fe , fcc co and fcc ni for three spectral ranges , extended visible range , soft and hard x - rays ( at the 2@xmath0-edges and 3@xmath0-edges , respectively ) . </S>",
    "<S> also , we express principal spectra directly using modified kubo formula . finally , we briefly express relations between signal measured by various magnetooptical techniques and off - diagonal permittivity elements . </S>"
