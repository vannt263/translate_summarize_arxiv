    "the energy spectrum of cosmic rays ( cr ) extends from below 1 gev up to at least @xmath3ev .",
    "the bulk of the cosmic rays below @xmath0@xmath4ev are probably galactic .",
    "it is currently unknown whether the ultra - high energy ( uhe ) cosmic rays are galactic or extragalactic in origin , and whether they are accelerated or result from emission by topological defects or decay of super - massive particles .",
    "if they are accelerated , they are almost certainly extragalactic in origin .",
    "this is because their gyroradii are sufficiently large that an anisotropy would be expected toward a galactic source population ( not observed ) , and because there are no obvious galactic source populations having magnetic fields such that gyroradii of uhe cr are compatible with their size .",
    "possible extragalactic acceleration sites include hotspots of giant radio galaxies , the intergalactic medium , gamma ray bursts and blazar jets .",
    "extragalactic cr at the highest energies are , however , subject to interaction with the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) . in the rest frame of a uhe cr proton ,",
    "photons of the 2.73  k cmbr are strongly blue - shifted to gamma - ray energies . the thresholds for bethe - heitler pair production and pion photo - production by uhe cr protons on the cmbr are close to @xmath5ev and @xmath6ev , respectively .",
    "protons at @xmath7@xmath8ev and 3@xmath9@xmath3ev typically lose a large fraction of their energy in a time of 1  gpc / c ( @xmath10y ) and 10  mpc / c ( @xmath11y ) , respectively .",
    "the importance of pion photoproduction on the cmbr was first noted by @xcite and @xcite and the cut - off they predicted is referred to as the `` gzk cut - off '' .",
    "the pion photoproduction interactions result in a flux of uhe neutrinos , often referred to as `` gzk neutrinos '' , which would point back to halos surrounding the uhe cosmic ray sources .",
    "several experiments ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) have reported uhe cr events with energies above @xmath3  ev .",
    "the auger array ( @xcite ) will soon report its results with excellent statistics .",
    "meanwhile , experiments such as anita ( @xcite ) and lunar cherenkov experiments are in progress to detect the uhe neutrinos which should give clues to the origin of uhecr .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite for recent reviews of uhecr and radio techniques in uhe neutrino and particle astronomy .",
    "remnants of jets and their surrounding cocoons may persist long after their parent agn fade from view .",
    "these colossal mhd structures decay slowly and yet may retain their relatively stable self - organized configurations .",
    "decay depends on the structure circuit resistance , and lifetimes could be quite long , given the large inductance of the circuit , an initial outward current along the jet and a return current back along an outer sheath or cocoon around the jet .",
    "the current closure condition requires that a large fraction of magnetic fields resistively dissipate .",
    "also @xcite argue for direct inductive acceleration in sheared relativistic jets while the jet are on , though not afterwards .",
    "we concentrate here on the fossil era , when a substantial fraction of jet energy has already been invested in the magnetic energy of the fossil and induction occurs through decay , not in the earlier building period  though both eras can contribute to acceleration schemes .",
    "helical structures are common in agn jets , arising during jet formation from rotation of magnetized plasma accreting toward the central black hole  this could be enhanced in the case of binary black hole systems .",
    "azimuthal electric currents are therefore likely , yielding a magnetic field component along the jet direction . in radio galaxy jets",
    "boundary layers are often clearly visible in radio polarization ( see , e.g. @xcite for observations and interpretation of the jets of 3c  31 ) .",
    "@xcite has argued that boundary layers in jets are sites of particle acceleration .",
    "laboratory mhd experiments show that reversed - field pinches are fairly stable . on the immense scale of these `` fossil jets '' ,",
    "the decay time from instability can be billions of years . however , decay of these colossal mhd structures on such time - scales result in electric fields capable of accelerating existing populations of lower energy cosmic rays up to ultra high energies with a flat spectrum extending from some minimum rigidity ( momentum / charge ) determined by fossil dimensions , magnetic field and decay time .",
    "we first review the properties expected of large magnetic fossils , based on extensive work in the plasma physics community over the last four decades .",
    "we assume that the governing , evolved equilibrium of initially jet - driven , then later , long - lived magnetic structures will be a reversed field pinch ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this axisymmetric configuration has magnetic field components ( in cylindrical coordinates ",
    "@xmath12 ) @xmath13 in an mhd equilibrium made stable by optimally efficient radial profiles , demanding a minimum of @xmath14 ",
    "@xmath15 is built by the jet current .    in a reversed - field pinch",
    "the crucial geometric feature is the longitudinal magnetic field , which changes direction at some critical distance from the jet axis . in experiments",
    "the rfp can be curved into a torus , creating a spheromak ( @xcite ) .",
    "we use a simple cylindrical rfp model below because , though a nearly spherical geometry may be better for an evolved fossil ( especially in rich clusters with nearly isotropic pressures ) , the spheromak geometry imposes many field curvatures effects in particle orbits which are a complication beyond the essential physical point of the reversed axial field .",
    "stable , low @xmath16 ( @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the plasma pressure ) reversed field pinch radial profiles have several properties :    1 .",
    "@xmath14 reverses near the outside of the confinement region .",
    "this is the crucial shear that stabilizes modes that can interchange flux tubes of plasma .",
    "it also prevents kink @xmath19 , current - driven instabilities .",
    "2 .   to suppress ",
    "sausage \" modes driven by pressure , a value of @xmath20 is essential .",
    "the smaller the @xmath16 , the more stabilized a confinement geometry becomes .",
    "3 .   a conducting  wall",
    "\" close enough to the plasma core to suppress the kink , @xmath21 , current - driven internal kink modes .",
    "this also completely damps all external kink modes .",
    "4 .   a pressure profile @xmath22 that is hollow or very flat in @xmath23 , to suppress interchange of magnetic flux tubes near the magnetic axis .",
    "@xcite showed that complicated equilibrium models of an isolated , force - free magnetic flux tube could be constructed with cylindrically symmetric , force - free magnetic fields .",
    "these had a sequence of concentric layers with piecewise - constant @xmath24 , where @xmath24 is a running index of the equilibria in concentric cylinders , each obeying the force - free condition , @xmath25 .",
    "they used analytical methods to construct models of the surface currents on these equilibria , finding some conditions such that the net current flux in the tube was zero .",
    "for example , a `` two-@xmath24 model '' permits current neutralization with a non - zero magnetic flux .",
    "an infinite series of equilibria are possible , yielding stable reversed - field geometries with various boundary conditions . often a nearby conducting boundary simplifies the equilibrium as an ideal approximation .",
    "are such equilibria at energy equipartition between magnetic and relativistic plasma energies ?",
    "@xcite studied in cluster  ghosts \" the limits on @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the ratio of the total relativistic particle energy to that in electrons radiating between 10 mhz to 10 ghz , and @xmath28 is the volume - filling factor of the relativistic plasma .",
    "strikingly , none of their `` bubbles '' had a simple equipartition between the pressures from the relativistic particles and the magnetic field .",
    "furthermore , @xmath26 did not strongly depend on any physical parameter of the host cluster .",
    "though at first there seemed to be two populations ",
    "@xmath26 values around 2 , another bunch around 300  this did not hold up ( @xcite ) .",
    "the apparent bimodality of the @xmath26 distribution could be explained as arising from two kinds of jets ",
    "electron - positron , giving a low value for @xmath27 , and electron - proton .",
    "if protons are the extra particles needed to maintain pressure equilibrium , but unseen in the radio emission , @xmath27 is high .",
    "also , bimodality could come from either a non - uniform magnetic field , or a filamentary structure in the lobes .",
    "both these possibilities are consistent with a reversed - field equilibrium , since fields vary spatially .",
    "variations in re - acceleration , which may occur from reconnection events in the field - reversal zone , could also affect the @xmath26 measure .",
    "at this point we know too little to infer much .",
    "clearly , though , constraints on the magnetic field of cluster bubbles found by comparing the synchrotron cooling time to the bubble age show that no bubbles in the sample are in equipartition .",
    "this is plausible as laboratory experience with long - lived  magnetic bottles \" such as tokomaks and reversed field pinches show that only those far from equipartition survive long . only when the plasma pressure is far less by several orders of magnitude than magnetic field energy density",
    "do structures long persist .",
    "this is an important lesson of the applied fusion research program , now over half a century old : only low @xmath16 is usefully stable .    in this spirit , we shall use the simplest possible current - neutralized , reversed - field model , with a single alpha and a nearby ideal conducting wall .",
    "it has zero total azimuthal magnetic flux since some current is carried in our assumed conducting wall .",
    "this simplification allows us to concentrate on the particle acceleration mechanisms in a simple geometry . without this simplification",
    ", we would need a more complex equilibrium .",
    "recent detections of several ghost cavities in galaxy clusters ( @xcite )  often , but not always , radio - emitting  suggest that the cluster hot plasma stays well separated from the bulk of the relativistic plasma on a timescale of @xmath0100 myr .",
    "some leakage is plausible , but robust survival does occur . in cases",
    "where the radio - emitting cosmic - ray clouds are confined within the observable hot gas reservoir of the cluster , the dimensions of the x - ray hole combined with the calculated gas pressure gives a `` laboratory - like '' measurement of the central black hole s energy that is converted into @xmath29 work against the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "an example is the x - ray cluster ms 0735.6 + 7421 observed in x - rays ( chandra ) by @xcite in which two large @xmath0200  kpc cavities are seem in the x - ray emission ; radio emission comes only from the cavities .",
    "the total energy from the agn outburst that created these giant magnetic bubbles , and probably re - heated the cluster gas , is estimated to be @xmath30 erg , of which a substantial fraction must be in magnetic field based on pressure arguments .",
    "dynamical changes will drive inductive electric fields ( @xcite , @xcite ) . referring to galaxy cluster embedded sources , @xcite states that pressure balance between the magnetic field and gas ( thermal and cr gas ) within the holes , and the external thermal hot gas pressure implies typical @xmath31 values of @xmath3230  @xmath33 g within the holes .",
    "so , these ghosts may be rfps .",
    "how have they survived so long ?",
    "@xcite proved a theorem : that for such jet - built rfp structures , the same simple mhd stability conditions guarantee stability , even after the jet turns off .",
    "this means that magnetic structures made stable while a jet is on can evolve into fossils that persist long after the building jet current has died away .",
    "these may be the relic radio `` fossils '' , `` ghost bubbles '' or `` magnetic balloons '' found in clusters and made visible by contrast against the x - ray emission as seen in hydra a by @xcite .",
    "giant radio galaxies such as cyg a are building such structures now . such fossils have a massive inventory of magnetic energy that can be @xmath0@xmath1 erg ( @xcite ) .",
    "such enormous energy can only come from the gravitational infall energy of a supermassive black hole , when jets convey a few percent of the energy outward .",
    "these equilibria will evolve under the magnetic tension that sustains them .",
    "they are active , responsive structures , not a disordered ball of magnetic fields .",
    "in rich clusters these balloons may contract under external gas pressure .",
    "they can later rise in the gravitational potential and then expand in the lesser external pressure farther from the cluster core .",
    "volume change will alter the plasma pressure as @xmath34 work changes the magnetic equilibrium .",
    "this in turn drives inductive electric fields , which can accelerate ions .",
    "we envision such inductive changes in response to external forces or internal evolution as the deep cause of high energy particle acceleration .",
    "the best examples of radio bubbles are 3c  84 , m87 and her  a. the edges of these bubbles are amazingly sharp , even in projection , as would be expected at the edge of a long - lived self ordered magnetic structure . indeed , because of the helicity present in the magnetic field of the original agn jet , the magnetic bubble it produces will retain this helicity and evolve to a self - organized force - free structure such as an rfp or sheromak , which are hard to pull apart  the toroidal field lines opposing the the lateral exansion of poloidal .",
    "the magnetic fields of these structures will therefore undergo minimal mixing with the overall cluster magnetic field , giving rise to the sharp edges seen radio images .",
    "they should thus also have larger magnetic fields than the surrounding intra - cluster medium .",
    "initially stable reversed field pinches become endangered by the current - driven global kink instability .",
    "this seems to be the most likely way for structures to fail when the jet current source is on , since there is more free energy to drive instability .",
    "if a structure survives the current - driven era , later stability seems more probable , as loss of the jet removes free energy . but suppose the system fails to shed magnetic helicity @xmath35 as dissipation of magnetic energy proceeds ( by reconnection , primarily ) .",
    "such helicity loss is well known to lead to kink instability . here",
    "we can turn to abundant laboratory experience as a guide .",
    "laboratory experiments provide much of our lore about reversed field pinches .",
    "these are all low pressure devices ( low @xmath16 ) .",
    "@xcite argued that in all systems with @xmath36 magnetic reconnection conserves global magnetic helicity , allowing stable geometries to evolve without losing stability ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this is so even without the infinite conductivity assumption that is common in astrophysics .",
    " unfreezing \" the magnetic field lines from plasma demands resistivity and thus some form of magnetic energy dissipation .",
    "even so , helicity can be preserved , as in the case of dissipation by reconnection .",
    "thus @xmath16-values approaching @xmath37 may occur in long - lived systems if helicity ( twist ) may be shed through turbulent processes other than reconnection .",
    "even if the plasma @xmath16 in the jet is not small , after the jet switches off and develops into as fossil jet with a self - organized magnetic structure , plasma cooling and expansion is expected to lead to lower @xmath16-values .",
    "recently , @xcite have compared detailed mhd simulations with radio observations of the jet of 3c  303 , a fr  ii with a knotty structure , with the knots appearing like self - contained magnetic structures launched along the jet .",
    "they find that in the knots @xmath38 , and that the jet is almost certainly elecromagnetically dominated rather than plasma dominated .",
    "a magnetically driven helical dynamo can also be described as  dynamical magnetic relaxation \" .",
    "magnetic relaxation describes how structures in magnetic - pressure - dominated environments evolve to their equilibrium states .",
    "the fully relaxed state is the taylor state , determined by minimizing the magnetic energy subject to the constraint that magnetic helicity is conserved .",
    "this leaves a force - free helical configuration with the field relaxing to the largest scale available , subject to boundary conditions . however , taylor s theory by itself is not a dynamical theory since it does not provide a time - dependent description of how the large scale magnetic helicity evolves .",
    "we can draw an analogy between spheromak or reversed - field pinch formation and coronal field relaxation : the laboratory configurations form because the injection of magnetic helicity into a system takes the system away from the relaxed state .",
    "but helicity injection also drives tearing mode fluctuations that yield a finite , turbulent electromotive force .",
    "this in turn drives the system to a new relaxed state . in astrophysical coronae",
    "the situation is similar .",
    "the helical field produced by a velocity - driven dynamo inside a rotator gets buoyantly fed from below into the corona .",
    "this takes the magnetically dominated corona away from the relaxed state , but fluctuations arise , driving the system back to a relaxed state .",
    "the corona thus acts like a  laboratory \" plasma volume injected with helicity from below .",
    "injection is not at one site , but throughout the coronal - surface boundary .",
    "while each of the individual injection sites ( flux tubes ) is like a single laboratory configuration if the field twists get injected along the tube , each tube can also open up to even larger scales by interacting with other tubes .",
    "magnetic energy then appears on much larger scales  a difference between the laboratory and astrophysical cases .",
    "the dynamo effect in laboratory plasmas is a self - organization process .",
    "resistive diffusion evolves the plasma away from a preferred state .",
    "the dynamo forces the plasma back toward the preferred , self - organized state.the resulting magnetic configuration has excess free energy leading to instabilities ( or turbulence ) that relax the plasma toward a state of lower magnetic energy",
    ". the plasma relaxes to the lower energy state through the  dynamo \" effect .",
    "the self - generation of plasma current reconfigures the large - scale magnetic field to one with lower energy .",
    "the structure of the relaxed state is partly captured by minimizing the magnetic energy in the plasma volume ( @xmath39 ) subject to the constraint of constant magnetic helicity ( @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the magnetic vector potential ) .",
    "magnetic helicity topologically measures the knottedness of the magnetic field lines .",
    "the minimization yields a magnetic field such that the ratio of the current density to magnetic field , @xmath42 , is a local spatial constant ( the taylor state ; @xcite ) . for a recent comprehensive discussion of these effects , which subsumes much of the earlier discussion especially as it unites theory and experiment ,",
    "see @xcite .    an experimental test of the taylor conjecture inferred the change in magnetic energy and helicity during a relaxation event ( @xcite ) .",
    "an approximate measurement modeled the instantaneous plasma state as a slowly varying mhd equilibrium . since the fields during relaxation change slower than an alfven time , the fields satisfy the mhd force balance equation , @xmath43 through discrete field twisting and braiding action .",
    "solution of this equation with experimental constraints found that during relaxation the magnetic energy reduces by about 8% , while the magnetic helicity drops by about 3% .",
    "the taylor conjecture gives a useful , experimentally verified framework to depict approximately the final state of the relaxation , or dynamo , process .",
    "but it provides no information on the physical mechanism of the dynamo .",
    "solution of the resistive nonlinear mhd equations reveals the detailed dynamics .",
    "the spatial fluctuations that underlie the dynamo are tearing instabilities driven by spatial gradients in @xmath42 , making the field lines tear and reconnect .",
    "the mhd description of such spontaneous magnetic reconnection has been investigated for several decades .",
    "linear theory shows that tearing instabilities grow on a timescale between a short alfven time ( @xmath44 ) , and the long resistive diffusion time ( @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the resistivity ) . for experimental plasma parameters ,",
    "the theoretical growth time is approximately 100  @xmath33s , comparable to the observed relaxation time . in astrophysical jet - built structures , this can be billions of years .",
    "tearing arises from a resonance between the fluctuating and mean magnetic fields",
    ". in laboratory plasma tearing occurs at many radii within the plasma , leading to large - scale reorganization . for stationary and homogeneous turbulence , magnetic helicity @xmath35",
    "is relatively conserved compared to magnetic energy during relaxation .",
    "these dynamo effects play important roles , conserving the total magnetic helicity , except for resistive effects and a small battery effect .    in astrophysical magnetic structure relaxation , charge and current imbalances adjust through the bulk , low energy plasma , which is collisional .",
    "the higher energy population can take advantage of the electric fields generated by decay , for they flow unimpeded along field lines , driven steadily by the electric fields .",
    "this is the essential picture in our model .",
    "the turbulent dynamo effect converts magnetic helicity from the turbulent magnetic field to the mean field , when the turbulence is electromagnetic .",
    "when the turbulence is electrostatic or due to the electron diamagnetic effect , the magnetic helicity of the mean magnetic field gets transported across space .",
    "two types of electric fields get generated during reconnection in the rfp .",
    "one is the helical electric field accompanying the helical tearing mode that causes the reconnection .",
    "the second is a mean , or axisymmetric , electric field induced by the flux change driven by the tearing mode dynamo .",
    "clearly this is a complicated phenomenon .",
    "we do not attempt to treat such details .",
    "instead , we shall simple take the inductive electric fields to be a fraction of the mean magnetic field . in the absence of detailed knowledge of the structure",
    ", this seems a good way to begin .",
    "the simplest idealization would be for an infinite cylindrical jet where the magnetic field in cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath12 ) is ( @xcite ) @xmath47 and this has been shown ( @xcite ) to be stable for @xmath48 .",
    "this radius for stability which we take to be @xmath49 is where a conducting wall with a large inertial mass would be present in an experimental situation , and provide part of the circuit along which a return current could flow , which we assume here to be the cocoon . the magnetic field",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "notice the longitudinal field changes sign at @xmath50 , the first zero of @xmath51 .",
    "one can use ampre s law to find the current density @xmath52 which is everywhere proportional to the magnetic field . from this , the vector potential is @xmath53 the outward electric current ( positive @xmath54 ) is associated with radii @xmath55 and the return current with radii @xmath56 , @xmath57 and so some of the return current must be at radii @xmath58  in the outer part of the cocoon or in the interstellar medium of the host galaxy in order to exactly balance the outward current .",
    "the plasma pressure may be calculated from eq .  1 of @xcite , i.e.@xmath59 solving this for @xmath60 given by eq .",
    "[ lundquist ] results in @xmath18=constant .",
    "that is , for @xmath60 given by eq .",
    "[ lundquist ] the tension of the azimuthal field lines perfectly balances the radially outward pressure of the longitudinal field .",
    "the critical radius , @xmath61 , where the longitudinal field @xmath14 changes sign , is also the radius where the longitudinal current density @xmath54 changes sign .",
    "it is also here that reconnection may occur and may be a site of particle acceleration . @xcite",
    "have considered acceleration in agn jets due to a reconnection electric field _ along _ the length of the jet of an active quasar . that paper shows acceleration of hadrons to uhe should be possible in active agn jets . the _ length _ of the jet is critical in their model , determining the maximum energy . we differ in that the reconnection electric field is azimuthal , i.e.  _ around _ the fossil cylinder .",
    "also , there should be many nearby remnants , so they can accelerate uhecrs , whereas active quasars tend to be at high redshift , and so their uhecrs will suffer the gzk cutoff if they are more than @xmath010 mpc away .      rather than assign a fixed fraction of the ambient magnetic field energy to the generated reconnection electric field",
    ", we can use results from laboratory observations in reversed field pinches ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the zone where @xmath14 reverses will probably be the reconnection site , since there only the azimuthal field needs to reconnect .    in reconnection regions ,",
    "micro - instabilities enhance resistivity , driving the reconnection rate .",
    "these arise from both electromagnetic and electrostatic modes .",
    "the electrostatic lower hybrid drift instability has been invoked , but recent work shows that it does not occur in the high-@xmath16 regions where reconnection occurs . there , electromagnetic instabilities prevail , as the @xmath14 field moves radially toward the reconnection region , in our assumed cylindrical geometry , preferentially annihilating in the zone where @xmath14 reverses sign .",
    "this drives an azimuthal electric field .",
    "the plasma is highly collisionless , so the induced resistivity greatly exceeds the spitzer level .",
    "the cause of this is ultimately the enhanced modes , such as the modified two - stream instability , which in experiment appear localized in the high - beta region where reconnection occurs .",
    "magnetic fluctuations @xmath62 appear also , correlated strongly with resistivity enhancement ( @xcite ) .    we can estimate the equivalent electric field generated in reconnection by noting that a momentum @xmath63 per unit volume appears in the electromagnetic waves , @xmath64    momentum moves from background plasma electrons and ions to the electromagnetic fluctuations at a rate @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the nonlinear damping rate on the electron - ion background plasma . in this highly nonlinear state , experiments show that @xmath67 , the unstable mode frequency .",
    "loss of momentum is a force equivalent to an effective electric field in the reconnection region , @xmath68 , given by @xmath69    the magnetic wave fluctuation levels seen in experiment are of magnitude @xmath70 the ambient averaged inflow field levels , @xmath14 .",
    "we thus set @xmath71 and the fraction @xmath72 .",
    "further , from experiment the observed wavelengths of this turbulence are the size of the coherence lengths in the fields , strongly suggesting a cooperative role ( @xcite ) .",
    "the relevant wavenumber @xmath27 is the inverse larmor radius of background electrons in the plasma , @xmath73 ( @xcite ) .    scaling the results of laboratory experiments , we find @xmath74 with @xmath75 being the plasma density , and taking @xmath76 g and assuming the heated region has kev energies . to attain fields of order @xmath77",
    "v / m then requires @xmath78 a bit larger , and perhaps @xmath31 of 100 @xmath33 g .",
    "plasma temperature may also be higher than kev , and density lower , also increasing @xmath68 .",
    "these parameter ranges would yield @xmath3 ev protons after several encounters with such structures of scale @xmath0mpc .",
    "thus , we consider the possibility of uhe cr getting sequential boosts in energy as a result of multiple encounters with different fossils in a similar way that @xcite envisage galactic cosmic rays get re - energized by multiple interactions with supernova remnants in the galactic disk .",
    "we expect it to be realistic to assume that electric fields outside the reconnection zone can also accelerate particles . the cold plasma ( pressure is low ) responsible for currents which maintain the magnetic structure can not short out these electric fields , since they are inductively driven everywhere in the structure , allowing acceleration outside the reconnection zone .",
    "next we investigate whether or not this alone will be viable for accelerating uhecr . in what follows",
    "we assume that electric fields outside the reconnection zone can accelerate particles .",
    "ultra - relativistic particles of charge @xmath82 are injected with energy @xmath86 ( note for ultra - relativistic particles @xmath87 ) and their final energies are binned as shown in fig .",
    "[ examplespectra ] .",
    "since the induced electric field is in the same direction as the magnetic field , energy is gained as particle move _ along _ field lines .",
    "thus we have also carried out simulations in which the particle s position is simply advanced along a field line , gaining momentum @xmath88 in step @xmath89 .",
    "results for this case with high statistics ( solid curves ) are in agreement with the results for full gyro motion .",
    "we have shown that for a decaying rfp , in which the electric field is everywhere parallel to the magnetic field , cosmic ray nuclei will gain energy unimpeded except by pion photoproduction on the cmbr  as they undergo helical motion around magnetic field lines their momentum component parallel to @xmath60 increases , while their momentum component perpendicular to @xmath60 and the gyroradius remains constant , as is seen in the trajectory shown in fig .  2 . note that the `` double peaked '' structure ( fig .",
    "3 ) is due to separate contributions from injection at @xmath55 and @xmath56 , as we shall show in the next section .",
    "no approximations were made in obtaining the energy spectrum , shown as the histogram in fig .  3 , by following particle trajectories in the electromagnetic field of a decaying rfp . to obtain an approximate analytic result",
    ", we can assume that a particle follows a helical path with its guiding centre on a single field line from one end of the jet to the other . since the induced electric field is proportional to the magnetic field according to eq .",
    "[ elecfield ] , positively charged particles will gain energy for pitch angles less than @xmath90 and lose energy if their pitch angles are greater than @xmath90 .",
    "the energy gain on traversing the jet length @xmath91 will actually depend on the pitch angle @xmath92 _ of the helical magnetic field line _ acting as the guiding centre .",
    "so , positive particles injected into the rfp with @xmath55 will gain energy while moving in the positive @xmath93 direction , and those injected with @xmath94 will gain energy while moving in the negative @xmath93 direction .",

    "this generally keeps them in the structure longer , as they do not move radially very much , so they leave only when they have drifted down the axis to the end . those which enter the fossil near the reconnection zone will be preferentially accelerated , becoming uhecrs .",

    "while a single ideal cylindrical rfp with particle injection over its ends yields an @xmath2 spectrum , the spectrum due to several with different maximum energies would inevitably be steeper .",
    "very recent results from the pierre auger observatory @xcite are not yet conclusive , but appear to be consistent with source spectral index in the range 2.22.5 .",
    "the spectrum of uhecr observed at earth would have contributions from nearby fossil jets at different distances , with different powers and each having different dimensions and magnetic fields , and hence a range of @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "for an individual fossil , the cut - off is expected to be rigidity dependent , implying the observed composition would change from light to heavy close to the cut - off if one or two nearby agn fossils dominate .",
    "however , if distant sources dominate nuclei will be photo - disintegrated by interactions with cmbr photons , and in this case the composition would remain light to the highest energies if distant sources or fossils dominated .",
    "otherwise the composition could be mixed near the observed cut off .",
    "nearby potential sources of uhe cr would include the bubbles around cen  a , the nearest powerful radio galaxy , and around m87 .",
    "radio observations at 20  cm of cen  a by @xcite indicate the presence of large features , one of which has been interpreted by @xcite as a buoyant bubble of plasma deposited by an intermittently active jet .",
    "even closer , in m87 there are two bubbles of synchrotron emission which appear to be inflated by outflows from the central engine visible in the low frequency radio data of @xcite , with an amazingly sharp edge indicating the possible presence of a shock .",
    "given the very high mass of the central black hole in m87 , its jet , although fairly powerful , is weak compared to its eddington limit , making m87 s bubbles a prime cadidate as a uhe cr accelerator .    as we expect most of the fossil jets to be below the sensitivity of current radio telescopes , it is impossible at the present time to make firm predictions for the expected uhecr intensity at earth .",
    "a low synchrotron surface brightness , only observable if at all at low frequency , does not necessarily mean that the magnetic field is low . rather , we would argue that it is the cooling of the relativistic electrons by synchrotron emission , since the last agn outburst which filled the bubble , that has reduced the synchrotron emissivity",
    ". however , such fossils may well observable when the ska ( http://www.skatelescope.org/ ) is commissioned , hopefully within @xmath010 years .",
    "nevertheless , we have demonstrated that it is possible for this process to accelerate protons to uhe , and nuclei to a @xmath129 times higher energy , and shown that the power requirements may reasonably be achieved given plausible volume filling factors .",
    "very recent anisotropy data from the pierre auger observatory ( @xcite,@xcite ) show no significant large - scale anisotropy or correlation of cosmic ray arrival directions with bl  lac objects .",
    "perhaps this is not surprising because propagation of cosmic rays through intergalactic magnetic fields will tend to isotropize their arrival directions , except perhaps for uhe cr protons at the highest energies from very nearby extragalactic sources . with longer",
    "exposure times auger may see such anisotropies , in which case the most probable source candidates would be bubbles around cen  a and m87 .",
    "neurino observatories may , in principle , see uhe neutrinos originating from directions close to uhe cosmic ray acceleration sites , through pion photoproduction interactions of the uhe cr on the cmbr during propagation from their sources .",
    "these `` gzk neutrinos '' would appear as haloes around the true source direction .",
    "of course , if such haloes appear where there are no obvious source candidates , they could well be from fossil jets with very low surface radio brightness .",
    "future work will include exploring observational consequences of this model at radio , x - ray and gamma - ray energies .",
    "will electron acceleration ( in opposite direction to protons ) be killed by streaming instability , or by other processes ?",
    "if so , this will heat the plasma . could this be seen in x - rays ? if not , radio synchrotron and gamma - ray signals could be generated .",
    "could these be detectable by existing radio telescopes or by the ska in coming decades , or by glast ( http://glast.stanford.edu/ ) ?",
    "how much of the energy of a fossil agn goes into cosmic rays ? finally , we mention the possibility that this mechanism operating for microquasars might be responsible for acceleration of some of the galactic population of cosmic rays",
    ".    in conclusion , remnants of jets and their surrounding cocoons may still be present around or close to galaxies which contain agn which are now no longer active .",
    "these fossil jets are colossal mhd structures and may have total energies @xmath130 erg . after a jet switches off , the fossil jet will organize itself into a stable configuration , such as the reverse - field pinch in which the longitudinal magnetic field changes direction at a critical distance from the axis , leading to re - connection there , and to slow decay of the large - scale rfp field .",
    "we have shown that this field decay induces large - scale electric fields which accelerate cosmic rays an @xmath2 power - law up to ultra - high energies .",
