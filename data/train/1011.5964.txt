    "we are concerned with specific linear algebra / matrix theory aspects of the vast field of inverse problems @xcite which model the blurring of signals and images ( @xmath1 or @xmath2 with @xmath3 ) . here",
    "the goal is to reconstruct the real object from its blurred and noisy version and this goal is a classical one in astronomical imaging , medical imaging , geosciences , etc . @xcite .",
    "the blurring model is assumed to be space - invariant , i.e. , the point spread function ( psf ) is represented by a specific bivariate function @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) for some univariate function @xmath6 @xcite . according to the linear models described in the literature @xcite , the observed signal or image @xmath7 and the original signal or image @xmath8",
    "are described by the relation @xmath9 where the kernel @xmath10 is the psf and @xmath11 denotes the noise .",
    "the problem ( [ nbf ] ) is ill - posed since the operator @xmath12 is compact @xcite . therefore , the approximation / discretization matrix of @xmath12 is usually increasingly ill - conditioned when the number @xmath13 of pixels becomes large .",
    "in addition , the size of the subspace associated with small eigenvalues , which substantially intersects the high frequencies , is large and proportional to the size of the matrix .",
    "thus , we can not directly solve @xmath14 , since the small perturbations , represented by the noise @xmath11 with important high frequency components due to its probabilistic nature , would be amplified unacceptably .    to remedy to the latter essential ill - conditioning of problem ( [ nbf ] )",
    ", one may employ regularization methods .",
    "the total variation ( tv ) regularization approach is a good choice for restoring edges of the original signals @xcite .",
    "rudin , osher , and fatemi @xcite gave the total variation functional in the form @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the euclidean norm .",
    "we note that the euclidean norm @xmath16 is not differentiable at zero . to avoid the non - differentiability , acar and vogel @xcite considered the following minimization @xmath17 where @xmath18 are positive parameters .",
    "notice that the penalty term @xmath19 converges to @xmath20 as @xmath21 .",
    "in other words , the latter is a differentiable regularized version of @xmath20 . the corresponding euler - lagrange equation for ( [ mp ] ) is given by @xmath22    \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial n } = 0 , & x\\in\\partial\\omega , \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath23 denotes the adjoint operator and @xmath24 is the differential operator appearing in ( [ el ] ) and comes from the regularized penalty term .",
    "vogel and oman @xcite proposed a lagged diffusivity fixed point ( fp ) iteration for solving ( [ el ] ) .",
    "more precisely , given the initial guess @xmath25 , the new iterate @xmath26 is obtained by @xmath27 thanks to the equation @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 denote the discretization / approximation matrix of @xmath12 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "we use the compound mid point rule and standard centered finite differences of precision order two for the finite dimensional approximation of @xmath12 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "therefore , at each fp iteration , we may use the preconditioned conjugate gradient ( pcg ) method ( * ? ? ?",
    "* algorithm 10.3.1 ) for solving the linear system .",
    "in @xcite the authors proposed a cosine preconditioner when @xmath29 is a toeplitz matrix , i.e. , in the case of zero - dirichlet boundary conditions ( bcs ) .",
    "however , the choice of such bcs induces remarkable pathologies in the quality of the restored images , which should be avoided or at least minimized . in reality , using classical bcs such as periodic or zero - dirichlet may imply , when the background is not uniformly black , disturbing gibbs phenomena called ringing effects @xcite .",
    "the novelty of this paper is represented by the choice of appropriate bcs , in order to reduce the ringing effects , and in the related matrix / numerical analysis .",
    "the latter will affect the algebraic expression of @xmath29 , while for @xmath33 the choice of the bcs in the euler - lagrange equation for ( [ el ] ) seems to impose neumann bcs . in this context , the idea is to combine the application of anti - reflective bcs , already studied for their precision with plain regularization methods like tikhonov and landweber @xcite , with the more sophisticate tv regularization .",
    "in other words , the first aim consists in checking how to reduce the ringing effects and the over - smoothing of the edges simultaneously .",
    "next , we want to study the use of preconditioners based on innovative fast transforms in the setting of krylov methods when the real problem is modeled by a symmetric psf .",
    "the final goal is to combine the precision of the reconstruction with highly efficient numerical procedures .",
    "we study some preconditioning techniques and give the theoretical explanations of different proposals .",
    "an effective preconditioner for the reflective bcs is inspired by the work in @xcite , while , for the anti - reflective bcs , we propose a new sine preconditioner for the linear system and explore the re - blurring approach introduced in @xcite .",
    "numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed preconditioners and the superiority of the antireflective bcs with respect to the reflective bcs . indeed ,",
    "antireflective bcs not only provide better restorations as expected ( see @xcite ) , but also require a lower computational cost .",
    "the latter is a consequence of the fact that a more precise model requires lesser regularization , i.e. a smaller @xmath34 , and the convergence of our approach is fast for small @xmath34 .    the paper is organized into seven more sections . in section [ bcs ]",
    "we consider reflective and anti - reflective bcs .",
    "sections [ prec - refl ] is devoted to define optimal preconditioners for signal and image deblurring for the reflective bcs and anti - reflective bcs . in section [",
    "sect : spectr ] some spectral features of the proposed preconditioners are discussed .",
    "section [ num2 ] is concerned with the numerical tests for checking the real efficiency of the considered preconditioners and the quality of the restorations .",
    "finally , in section [ final ] we draw conclusions .",
    "we start by introducing the one - dimensional deblurring problem . consider the original signal @xmath35 @xmath36 and the normalized blurring psf given by    @xmath37    with the usual normalization , i.e. , @xmath38 which preserves the global intensity and therefore represents an average .",
    "the blurred signal @xmath7 is the convolution of @xmath10 and @xmath39 and consequently @xmath40 is such that @xmath41 the deblurring problem is to recover the vector @xmath42 given the blurring function @xmath10 and a blurred signal @xmath43 of finite length , thus the blurred signal @xmath7 is determined not only by @xmath8 , but also by @xmath44 and @xmath45 and the linear system ( [ blurred1d : matrixform ] ) is underdetermined . to overcome this ,",
    "we make certain assumptions , that is the bcs on the unknown boundary data @xmath46 and @xmath47 in such a way that the number of unknowns equals the number of equations .    for the _ zero - dirichlet _",
    "bcs , we assume that the data outside @xmath8 are zero , i.e. , we set @xmath48 for @xmath49 .",
    "then , ( [ blurred1d : matrixform ] ) becomes @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is toeplitz .",
    "for the _ periodic _ bcs , we assume that the signal @xmath8 is extended by periodicity . more precisely , we set @xmath52 and @xmath53 for @xmath49 .",
    "it follows that ( [ blurred1d : matrixform ] ) becomes @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is circulant and hence it can be diagonalized by the discrete fourier transform ( dft ) ( see @xcite ) .    for the _ neumann or reflective _ bcs , we assume that the data outside @xmath8 are a reflection of the data inside @xmath8 ( refer to @xcite ) .",
    "more precisely , we set @xmath54 and @xmath55 for all @xmath49 in ( [ blurred1d : matrixform ] ) . thus ( [ blurred1d : matrixform ] ) becomes @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is neither toeplitz nor circulant but a special @xmath13-by-@xmath13 toeplitz plus hankel matrix which is diagonalized by the discrete cosine transform provided that the blurring function @xmath10 is symmetric , i.e. , @xmath56 for all @xmath57 in ( [ blur1d ] ) .",
    "it follows that the above system can be solved by using three fast cosine transforms ( fcts ) in @xmath58 operations @xcite .",
    "this approach is computationally interesting since the fct requires only real operations and is about twice as fast as the fft and this is true in two dimensions as well .",
    "we note that the reflection ensures the continuity of the signal and the error is linear in the discretization step ( the latter can be easily seen by applying a taylor expansion @xcite ) . therefore , we usually observe a reduction of the boundary artifacts with respect to zero - dirichlet and periodic bcs .    for the _ anti - reflective _ bcs , we assume that the data outside @xmath8 are an anti - reflection of the data inside @xmath8 . more precisely ,",
    "if @xmath59 is a point outside the domain and @xmath60 is the closest boundary point , then we have @xmath61 and the quantity @xmath62 is approximated by @xmath63",
    ". consequently , we set @xmath64 in ( [ blurred1d : matrixform ] ) . by a taylor expansion ,",
    "the anti - reflection ensures a @xmath65 continuity of the signal and the error is quadratic in the discretization step @xcite .",
    "usually , the boundary artifacts are reduced also with respect to reflective bcs .",
    "imposing the anti - reflection , the linear system becomes @xmath66 , where @xmath51 is a toeplitz plus hankel plus a rank-2 correction matrix , where the correction is placed at the first and the last column .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite the authors proved that if @xmath10 is symmetric then @xmath67 where @xmath68,\\quad t_n^{-1 } = \\left [          \\begin{array}{ccc }            1 & 0 & 0 \\\\           -s_{n-2}p & s_{n-2 } & -s_{n-2}jp \\\\            0 & 0 & 1 \\\\          \\end{array }        \\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath69 is the flip matrix ,",
    "@xmath70 is the sine transform matrix of order @xmath71 , and where @xmath72 so that the first column vector is exactly the sampling of the function @xmath73 on the grid @xmath74 for @xmath75 .",
    "finally , @xmath76 is a diagonal matrix given by suitable samplings of the function @xmath77 which is the symbol generated by the psf .",
    "that is , @xmath78 where @xmath79 as a consequence , a generic system @xmath80 can be solved within @xmath81 real operations by resorting to the application of three fast sine transforms ( fsts ) ( refer to @xcite ) , where each fst is computationally as cheap as a generic fct .",
    "there is a suggestive functional interpretation of the transform @xmath82 .",
    "the transform associated with periodic bcs matrices is the fourier transform : its @xmath57-th column vector , up to a normalizing scalar factor , can be viewed as a sampling , over a suitable uniform gridding of @xmath83 $ ] , of the frequency function @xmath84 .",
    "analogously , when imposing reflective bcs with a strongly symmetric psf , the transform of the related reflective bcs matrices is the cosine transform : its @xmath57-th column vector , up to a normalizing scalar factor , can be viewed as a sampling , over a suitable uniform gridding of @xmath85 $ ] , of the frequency function @xmath86 . here",
    "the imposition of the anti - reflective bcs , by operating a central symmetry with respect to any point of frontier , can be functionally interpreted as a linear combination of sine functions and of linear polynomials ( whose use is exactly required for imposing the @xmath65 continuity at the borders ) . this intuition becomes evident in the expression of @xmath82 .",
    "indeed @xmath87 where @xmath88 is defined and it is a suitable gridding of @xmath89 $ ] .",
    "now , we introduce the two - dimensional case . for the neumann or reflective bcs ,",
    "the blurring matrix is a block toeplitz - plus - hankel matrix with toeplitz - plus - hankel blocks and can be diagonalized by the two - dimensional fcts ( which are tensor products of one - dimensional fcts ) in @xmath90 operations provided that @xmath10 is quadrantally symmetric , i.e. , @xmath91 ( refer to @xcite ) .    for the anti - reflective bcs ,",
    "we assume that the data outside @xmath8 are an anti - reflection of the data inside @xmath8 , i.e. , a point outside the domain is anti - reflective to the closest boundary point first in one direction and then in the other direction .",
    "in particular , we set @xmath92 when both indices lie outside the range @xmath93 ( this happens close to the @xmath94 corners of the given image ) , we set @xmath95 for @xmath96 .",
    "if the blurring function ( psf ) @xmath10 is quadrantally symmetric , then the blurring matrix is a block toeplitz - plus - hankel - plus-2-rank - correction matrix with toeplitz - plus - hankel - plus-2-rank - correction blocks and can be diagonalized by the two - dimensional anti - reflective transforms ( which are tensor products of one - dimensional anti - reflective transforms @xmath82 ) in @xmath97 real operations ( see for instance @xcite ) . in the following",
    "we will assume a symmetric ( quadrantally symmetric in 2d ) psf since reflective and anti - reflective bcs can be diagonalized by fast transforms only in such case .",
    "however , in the nonsymmetric case , even if the blurring matrix can not be diagonalized by fast transforms , the matrix - vector product can be done again in @xmath90 by ffts . moreover , many practical blur have the symmetry like the celebrated gaussian blur widely used in several contexts .",
    "the optimal preconditioner for a matrix @xmath51 aims to find an approximation which minimizes @xmath98 over all @xmath99 in a set of matrices for the matrix frobenius norm @xmath100 : the typical set of matrices is formed by considering an algebra of matrices which are simultaneously diagonalized by a given unitary transform .",
    "the main novelty in our context is represented by the fact that the anti - reflective matrices with symmetric psfs form a commutative algebra associated to a non - unitary transform .",
    "the latter poses nontrivial difficulties that are treated in the sequel of the paper .",
    "the optimal circulant preconditioner was originally given in @xcite .",
    "the optimal sine transform preconditioner was presented in @xcite .",
    "the optimal cosine transform preconditioner was provided in @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we construct the optimal reflective bcs preconditioner and the optimal anti - reflective bcs preconditioner for ( [ fp ] ) and the optimal reblurring preconditioner for the reblurring equation ( [ fpp ] ) below instead of ( [ fp ] ) .",
    "some of these preconditioning techniques are inspired from the idea proposed in @xcite for zero - dirichlet bcs .",
    "for the one - dimensional problems , we assume a symmetric and normalized psf .",
    "suppose that we impose the reflective bcs on @xmath29 and the zero neumann bcs on @xmath33 . in this case , we propose the following reflective bcs preconditioners for ( [ fp ] ) .",

    "for an @xmath221-by-@xmath221 matrix @xmath51 defined in ( [ eq : blocka ] ) , the level-1 reblurring preconditioner @xmath254 is given by @xmath255 using the same proof as in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.3 ) , we can easily show that the level-2 reblurring preconditioner @xmath256 is given by @xmath257 .",
    "now , we design the reblurring preconditioner @xmath258 for the linear equation ( [ fpp ] ) . since @xmath29 is the anti - reflective bcs matrix ,",
    "we define a reblurring preconditioner for the linear equation ( [ fpp ] ) as @xmath259 also , the reblurring preconditioner with diagonal scaling is given by @xmath260 and the reblurring preconditioner for the two - dimensional scaled linear system ( [ eq : scalereb ] ) is @xmath261 where @xmath262 .",
    "let @xmath127 , @xmath128 , and @xmath129 denote the eigenvalue matrices of @xmath29 , @xmath263 , and @xmath264 , respectively .",
    "then , the two - dimensional preconditioner @xmath204 can be written as @xmath265 again , these two - dimensional preconditioner shows interesting computational features since the associated linear systems can be solved within @xmath90 operations .",
    "in order to study the effectiveness of the proposed preconditioners , we need the clustering analysis of the spectrum . also , localization of eigenvalues is of interest when solving via pcg or by pbicgstab @xcite . here is a useful definition @xcite for sequences of matrices @xmath266 where @xmath267 has size @xmath268 , @xmath13 positive integer , and @xmath269 if @xmath270 .",
    "[ def - distribution ] a matrix sequence @xmath266 is said to be _ distributed @xmath271 in the sense of the eigenvalues@xmath272 as the pair @xmath273 , _ or _ have the distribution function @xmath274 _",
    ", if , for any @xmath275 , the following limit relation holds @xmath276 where @xmath277 denote the eigenvalues of @xmath267 and @xmath278 is the standard lebesgue measure . in that case we write @xmath279",
    ".    an interesting consequence of the equation is that @xmath279 implies that most of the eigenvalues are contained within any @xmath280-neighborhood of the essential range of @xmath274 .",
    "that is , the range of @xmath274 is a cluster for the spectrum of the sequence @xmath266 .",
    "the main observation is that all the matrices considered so far are low - rank perturbations of toeplitz matrices or can be viewed as extracted from generalized locally toeplitz ( glt ) sequences ( see @xcite and references therein and the seminal work @xcite ) .",
    "this observation is very important since every glt sequence has a symbol and this symbol is the spectral distribution function in the sense of the latter definition .",
    "furthermore , the class of glt sequences is an algebra of matrix - sequences .",
    "hence , when making linear combinations , products , or inverses ( the latter operation only when the symbol does not vanish on sets of positive measure ) , the result is a new glt sequence whose symbol can be obtained via the same operations on the original symbols , as those performed on the matrices .",
    "therefore , a particular case is that of the preconditioned matrices can be seen again as extracted from a glt sequence whose symbol is the ratio of the symbols : here the numerator is the symbol of the original matrix sequence and the denominator is the symbol of the preconditioning sequence .    in this section , according to definition [ def - distribution ] and since we are interested in asymptotic estimates , we are forced to indicate explicitly the parameter @xmath13 which uniquely defines the size of the associated matrix .",
    "first , we discuss in detail the case of reflective bcs . when considering @xmath281 , it is well - known @xcite that @xmath282^d , \\\\[2 mm ] a(x ) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{|\\nabla x|^2+\\beta^2 } } & w(t ) = \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^d(2 - 2\\cos(t_i ) ) .",

    "the sequence @xmath287 is clustered at one only if the sequence @xmath288 is clustered at zero . since @xmath289 ,",
    "the optimal cosine preconditioner is effective only if the function @xmath285 has no large variation . to obtain a clustering preconditioner , a diagonal",
    "scaling has to be introduced . indeed , the preconditioner @xmath290 is such that @xmath291 due to the algebra stucture of glt sequences , and hence the preconditioned sequence is clustered at one . in our case , the coefficient matrix @xmath292 is the sum of an integral approximate operator and an approximate elliptic differential operator .",
    "we note that @xmath293 , where @xmath294 is the symbol of the psf defined in for the 1d case and similarly can be defined for @xmath295 ( the entries of the psf are the fourier coefficients of @xmath294 ) .",
    "an effective preconditioner has to consider both terms which consitute the matrix @xmath267 .",
    "this is the aim of the preconditioner @xmath296 defined in and for the 1d and 2d case , respectively .",
    "we have @xmath297 and so @xmath298 . in this case",
    ", we can not apply a diagonal scaling to @xmath114 because otherwise we loose the computational efficiency , the matrix @xmath299 can not be diagonalized by discrete cosine transforms .",
    "therefore , we have to apply to @xmath296 a diagonal scaling which should be act like @xmath300 on @xmath114 , while it should be no affect the term @xmath301 . unfortunately , since we have a diagonal scaling we can not apply the diagonal scaling only to a term of the sum . to balance the contribution of the two terms , the diagonal scaling is defined by the matrix @xmath166 in which leads to the preconditioner @xmath302 .",
    "we have @xmath303 and hence the preconditioned sequence is not clustered at one , even if for values of @xmath34 used in the considered applications it shows an optimal behaviour ( see figure [ fig : pcgn ] ) .",
    "we recall that the clustering is a useful property but it is not strictly necessary for the optimality of the related preconditioned krylov method : for instance in the hermitian positive definite case and when dealing with the pcg iterations , the spectral equivalence is sufficient .",
    "since @xmath304 is similar to @xmath305 , with @xmath306 , the use of the preconditioner @xmath302 to the linear system is equivalent to apply the preconditioner @xmath119 to the scaled linear system .",
    "however , the scaling of the linear suggest to use a cosine preconditioner different from @xmath119 that is @xmath132 which is more effective for large values of @xmath34 ( see numerical results in section [ num2 ] ) .    [",
    "rem : alpha ] for small values of @xmath34 , i.e. , when few regularization is required , the three preconditioners @xmath119 , @xmath302 and @xmath132 have a similar behaviour .",
    "moreover , when @xmath34 goes to zero the effectiveness of the proposed preconditioners increases because the preconditioners and the original coefficient matrix @xmath267 all tend to @xmath301 .    for concluding this section , we note that in the case of anti - reflective bcs similar considerations can be done .",
    "the main difference is when we consider the reblurring strategy .",
    "however , using the results in @xcite , the nonsymmetric case can be considered as well since the antisymmetric part has trace norm ( sum of all singular values ) bounded by a pure constant independent of @xmath13 .",
    "therefore the spectral distribution is governed by the symmetric part which is dominant as discussed in section 3.3 of @xcite .",
    "we will solve the problem ( [ el ] ) by the fixed point method with the operator @xmath12 approximated by using different bcs and with the matrix @xmath307 imposed by zero neumann bcs or anti - reflective bcs .",
    "the algorithm was implemented in matlab 7.10 and run on a pc intel pentium iv of 3.00 ghz cpu .",
    "we shall show the effectiveness of the proposed preconditioners for the signal / image deblurring and also give a comparison of the quality of the restored signals / images with different bcs .    in our test , for simplicity , we choose initial guess @xmath308 for the fp algorithm .",
    "we shall solve ( [ fp ] ) by the pcg method when the neumann bcs imposed on @xmath33 and solve ( [ fp ] ) by the pbicgstab method when the anti - reflective bcs imposed on @xmath33 . also , we solve ( [ fpp ] ) by the pbicgstab method .",
    "the initial guess for the pcg and pbicgstab methods in @xmath309th fp iteration is chosen to be the @xmath310th fp iterate .",
    "the pcg and pbicgstab iterations are stopped when the residual vector @xmath311 of the linear systems ( [ fp ] ) and ( [ fpp ] ) at the @xmath309th iteration satisfies @xmath312 , where @xmath313 is set to @xmath314 and @xmath315 in the 1d and 2d case , respectively .",

    ", we only give the average number of cg / bicgstab iterations per fp step . table [",
    "table2 - 1 ] suggests that the preconditioners @xmath206 , with @xmath318 , are very effective matrix approximations for all values of @xmath34 , while the preconditioners @xmath319 do not work well for large values of @xmath34 especially for antireflective bcs .",
    "however , for antireflective bcs a good choice for @xmath34 is in the interval @xmath320 $ ] and in this case both choices @xmath206 and @xmath319 have a similar behaviour .",
    "we note that the number of fp iterations decrease with @xmath34 , so if we have a good model that requires a lower regularization we obtain a gain also in terms of the computational cost of the whole restoration procedure . in all our tests",
    ", it is shown that @xmath321 tends to @xmath322 or @xmath323 at the final fp iterate .",
    "+     +     +     +     +    next , we shall check the quality of restored images by using different bcs .",

    "[ fig : res ] shows that the anti - reflective bcs lead to better restored images and shaper edges with a lower computational cost than the reflective bcs ( note the high reduction in the fp iterations being @xmath325 smaller ) .",
    "in this paper , we have considered the effect of reflective and anti - reflective bcs , when regularizing blurred and noisy images via the total variation approach . in particular , we have studied some preconditioning strategies for the linear systems arising from the fp iteration given in @xcite . in the case of anti - reflective bcs",
    "we have also considered a comparison with the reblurring idea proposed in @xcite .",
    "we recall that the latter has been shown effective when combined with the tikhonov regularization and here one of the issues was to verify that reblurring and total variation can be combined satisfactorily .",
    "furthermore , the optimal behavior of our preconditioners has been validated numerically .    beside the computational features of the preconditioning techniques",
    ", we stress the improvement obtained via anti - reflective bcs both in terms of reconstruction quality and reduction of the computational cost .",
    "in fact , the precision of such bcs was already known in the relevant literature ( see @xcite and references there reported ) . however , this is the first time that the anti - reflective bcs have been combined with a sophisticated regularization method , where the use of fast transforms is very welcome for saving computational cost .",
    "the precision of the antireflective bcs implies also a further reduction of the computational cost over the other bcs ( see numerical results in section [ num2 ] ) because they require a smaller regularization parameter @xmath34 and the effectiveness of the proposed preconditioners increases reducing @xmath34 .",
    "potential lines of interest for future investigations could include the use of anti - reflective bcs in the promising split bregman method recently proposed in @xcite and a more precise clustering analysis of the preconditioning sequences , in the spirit of section [ sect : spectr ] .",
