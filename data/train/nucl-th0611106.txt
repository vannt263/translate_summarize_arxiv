    "nuclear excitation by electron transition ( neet ) @xcite is a process of nonradiative nuclear excitation by means of direct energy transfer from the excited atomic shell to the nucleus via a virtual photon .",
    "this process is possible , if within the atomic shell there exists an electronic transition close in energy and coinciding in type with the nuclear one .",
    "the modern theory of the neet was developed in refs .",
    "this theory agrees reasonably with experimental results obtained for nuclei @xmath1au @xcite , @xmath3ir @xcite , and @xmath4os @xcite in recent years .",
    "the neet process was investigated in the experiments @xcite for the case where the energy of photons exceeded the @xmath0-shell electron binding energy appreciably . in such a situation one could neglect the threshold effects @xcite and write the relative probability for nuclear excitation in atomic transition @xmath5 in the following form    @xmath6    in eq  ( [ eq : pneet ] ) @xmath7 are the widths of the initial and final electronic states , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the energies of the atomic and nuclear transitions ( the adopted system of units is @xmath10 ) , @xmath11 is averaged over the initial states and summed over the final ones , the square modulus of the hamiltonian of the interaction @xmath12 of the electronic hole current @xmath13 and the nuclear current @xmath14 in the second order of the perturbation theory for the qed    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the photon propagator .",
    "the cross section of @xmath1au excitation on the isomeric level @xmath17(77.351 kev , 1.91 ns ) by photons near the @xmath0-shell ionization threshold of gold was measured in work @xcite .",
    "it was found that the neet events rose up just above the @xmath0-absorption edge and the neet edge of width @xmath18 ev existed at @xmath19 ev higher than the @xmath0-edge .",
    "the incident synchrotron radiation beam had a @xmath20 ev width .",
    "theoretical explanation is needed for the results obtained in ref .",
    "we consider here a model of the process founded in ref .",
    "@xcite and describe the main characteristics of the process . following the tradition we call this process `` the neet near @xmath0-edge '' . however , here we pay attention to the cross - section of the process of the nuclear excitation as a result of ionization of the atomic @xmath0-shell .",
    "the neet as we shall see below is a special case of the considered process in the asymptotic limit of `` high '' energies far from the photoionization threshold .",
    "the process of the nuclear excitation as a result of ionization of the atomic @xmath0-shell is described by two diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fd ] .",
    "one electron passes from the @xmath0-shell to the continuum .",
    "we consider here the case of nuclear excitation by the atomic @xmath21 transition .",
    "according to the qed rules @xcite the amplitude can be written as    @xmath22    for the direct diagram ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fd](a ) ) and as    @xmath23    for the exchange diagram ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fd](b ) ) . in eqs  ( [ eq : sdir])-([eq : sex ] )",
    "@xmath24 is the proton charge , @xmath25 are the dirac matrices .",
    "we will use the following designations for the wave functions of the particles and for the nuclear current shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fd ] .",
    "@xmath26 is the synchrotron radiation photon with the energy @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28 is the electron with the energy @xmath29 emitted from the @xmath0-shell to the continuum .",
    "@xmath30 is the electron hole at the @xmath31-shell with the binding energy @xmath32 and the width @xmath33 .",
    "the photon propagator @xmath34 is calculated according to the relation @xmath35 the nuclear current is @xmath36 , where the nuclear wave functions are @xmath37 for the ground state ( @xmath38 usually ) and @xmath39 for the isomeric state with the energy @xmath40 and the width @xmath41 , and @xmath42 is the operator of the nuclear electromagnetic transition .",
    "the propagator of the hole @xmath43 in our model is the @xmath0-shell hole propagator @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the electron binding energy , @xmath46 is the total hole width at the @xmath0-shell ( see in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the model considered here has some peculiarities .",
    "let us look at some of them more carefully .",
    "let us begin from the neet process .",
    "the excitation of the nuclei @xmath1au , @xmath3ir , and @xmath4os takes place in reality in the electron transition from the @xmath31-shell to the @xmath0-shell , which occurs when a photon is absorbed , and electron in the @xmath0-shell is excited into the continuum , leaving the @xmath0-hole behind .",
    "the electrons in the atomic shell interact with each other and generate a self - consistent field providing that many - particle effects became very important for most of the processes inside the atomic shell .",
    "that is why one should take into account the ejected electron - hole interaction , the pair electron - electron interactions , etc . for correct description of the neet process .",
    "nevertheless , in our model the nucleus is excited in a single - particle hole transition , as it is shown on the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : fd ] .",
    "correspondingly we use the single - particle approximation for the calculation of the atomic matrix elements .",
    "one can do that , because numerous computations show that this approximation works well for the electronic transitions between the inner atomic shells , if one estimates of the @xmath47-rays intensities , as well as for the electron transitions from the inner atomic shells to the continuum , if one estimates of the internal electronic conversion probabilities .",
    "that is why one can use this approximation to the numerical evaluation of the `` electronic part '' of the neet .",
    "we use the experimental values for the atomic shell widths .",
    "therefore @xmath46 in the propagators does not involve the neet partial width . on the other hand the neet probabilities are very small , and they do not change practically the @xmath0-shell widths . for another thing we use the widths @xmath33 for the final hole states on the diagrams in fig .  [",
    "fig : fd ] .",
    "this method is not typical for the qed .",
    "as it was shown in ref.@xcite , the use in the wave functions of the real widths of the vacancies enables us to take into account the further decay of the electron hole into an upper atomic level without having to consider higher - order diagrams .",
    "another important approximation concerns the hole propagator .",
    "strictly speaking all the atomic shells , which have the electrons , contribute to the hole propagator .",
    "however the energy conservation law leaves the @xmath0-shell only in the hole propagator in the direct diagram in our case , because only one atomic transition ( the @xmath21 transition ) satisfies the condition @xmath48 .",
    "the hole propagator in the exchange diagram may contain of the contributions of all atomic shells .",
    "however this propagator does not have poles in the discrete part of the spectrum , hence the contribution of the exchange diagram is negligible . as for the continuum spectrum",
    "there is no any contribution of these hole states to the hole propagator in fig .",
    "[ fig : fd ] .",
    "a photon is absorbed by an electron in the atomic shell and a hole is arisen .",
    "the atomic inner - hole state is highly - excited and short - lived discrete state . in the general case",
    "the wave function of the time - dependent state can be expressed as a decomposition into a sum , and an integral over the complete set of eigenfunctions @xmath49 with @xmath50 belonging to the discrete spectrum ( @xmath51 ) , and @xmath52 with @xmath53 belonging to the continuous spectrum .",
    "thus the propagator of the atomic inner - hole generally should have two parts .",
    "but there are no electrons in the continuum in our case .",
    "the continuum is occupied by holes ( i.e. by the electron vacancies ) .",
    "these electron vacancies are fermions , hence the hole creation is impossible in these states , and the transitions to these intermediate states are forbidden too .",
    "so , these states do not give any contribution to the hole propagator at all .",
    "it becomes evident , if one considers the following process ( which is identical to the one in fig .",
    "[ fig : fd ] ) : the hole in the continuum absorbs a photon and passes to the @xmath0 shell firstly ; after that the nucleus is excited in the hole transition @xmath54 . only the atomic states occupied by electrons are the `` acting '' intermediate states here , similarly to the process in fig .",
    "[ fig : fd ] .",
    "that is why we actually can neglect the continuum part of the energy spectrum in the hole propagator in eqs  ( [ eq : sdir])([eq : sex ] ) .",
    "as it follows from the comparison of the results of @xcite , the single - particle approximation describes well the neet process with the simplest form of the propagator , and the technique of feynman diagrams gives the same formula for the neet probability , that follows from solution of the equations for time - dependent amplitudes of the total `` the hole + the nucleus '' wave function @xcite .",
    "the cross section of the process shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fd ] is calculated from the following formula @xcite @xmath55 where @xmath56 means averaging over the initial states and summation over the final ones .",
    "the process progresses in the time interval @xmath57 .",
    "we do not fix the electron energy @xmath29 .",
    "that is why we integrate the cross section over the electron momentum @xmath58 .",
    "it is easy to show that after integration in eqs  ( [ eq : sdir])-([eq : sex ] ) over the times @xmath59 and over the energies of the intermediate states @xmath60 the amplitude @xmath61 contains only one resonance condition .",
    "this condition corresponds to the energy conservation law of the process .",
    "the amplitude @xmath62 has an additional resonance condition for the energy of photons @xmath63 . as a result",
    "the exchange diagram gives a contribution three orders of the magnitude smaller than the direct diagram .",
    "correspondingly , one can neglect the exchange diagram fig .",
    "[ fig : fd](b ) near the threshold .",
    "the following expression is obtained for the cross section in this case    @xmath64    in eq  ( [ eq : sigma1 ] ) we sum up over the photon polarization @xmath65 , the magnetic quantum number of the free electron @xmath66 , the magnetic quantum number of the @xmath31-hole @xmath67 , and the magnetic quantum numbers of the nucleus @xmath68 .",

    "it is obvious that the functions @xmath76 and @xmath5 do not depend on the energies @xmath27 and @xmath29 .",

    "let us take into account that the expression @xmath97 ( @xmath98 , @xmath99 is the electron mass ) depends little on the nonrelativistic kinetic energy of electron @xmath100 near the threshold @xcite . as a consequence we can introduce the following cross section near the threshold    @xmath101 and we can consider @xmath102 as a constant in the energy range around the threshold .",
    "the width of the @xmath0-shell plays an important role in the process considered here .",

    "that is why one can integrate in the range @xmath107 in eq  ( [ eq : sigma2 ] ) in spite of the fact that @xmath29 is the nonrelativistic energy of electron .",
