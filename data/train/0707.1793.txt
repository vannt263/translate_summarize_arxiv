    "in @xmath1cdm cosmology galaxies are assembled hierarchically over an extended period by mergers of smaller systems .",
    "all galaxies , including early type galaxies ( etgs ) , are expected to contain multi - epoch stellar populations .",
    "toomre & toomre @xcite were the first to suggest that some early types could form from the interactions of disk galaxies .",
    "they predicted that a dynamical redistribution of stars could transform merging disk galaxies into an elliptical galaxy , though such a redistribution of a collisionless system would not increase the maximum density to that observed in elliptical cores @xcite .",
    "it was later realized that the gaseous components of the progenitor galaxies would collide , compress , and rapidly flow into the center of the gravitational potential well @xcite , where they can form new stars , thereby increasing the central density of the remnant .",
    "there is considerable evidence supporting a merger origin for at least some fraction of the etg population .",
    "observations of the disk - disk merger remnant ngc7252 show a surface brightness profile as well as a maximum density similar to an elliptical galaxy , not to a disk galaxy @xcite .",
    "molecular gas densities in three merger remnants similarly indicate evolution toward an etg remnant @xcite . a study of the k - band light profiles of coalesced merger remnants found excess stellar light @xcite in the centers of some of the galaxies .",
    "monochromatic photometric surveys of nearby etgs @xcite have serendipitously discovered that 20 - 40% have excess light above a smooth profile in the center - most regions , and many nearby etgs show dynamical disturbances that correlate with color @xcite . finally , at higher redshifts etgs with blue cores @xcite and the e+a galaxies @xcite are likely post - merger systems .",
    "if these central light excesses result from mergers , they are likely to contain intermediate - age stellar populations . in this project",
    ", we are using the hubble space telescope ( hst ) to study that possibility by obtaining near - uv light profiles and colors of two groups of etgs : a main sample with excess light in their centers and a control sample without .",
    "we emphasize the near - uv band because it is the most sensitive to intermediate - age stellar populations .",
    "twelve galaxies were selected from published hst imaging studies of etgs @xcite .",
    "we chose six galaxies with light profiles that rise smoothly with decreasing radius and six with apparent excess light at small radii above a smooth profile .",
    "all twelve were chosen to have no known agns and no discernible central dust .",
    "the sample includes seven e s , one de , and four s0 galaxies .",
    "the twelve galaxies were observed in cycle 13 with hst using the acs - hrc in three filters : f250w ( `` nuv '' ) , f330w ( `` u '' ) , and f555w ( `` v '' ) . the exposure times were selected to achieve similar sensitivity levels across all bands .",
    "each exposure was dithered in four positions per filter for sub - pixel sampling and cosmic ray cleaning .",
    "the pixel scale of the hrc is @xmath2/pix with a @xmath3 field of view and the full - width half maximum of the point spread function ( psf ) is 0.0459@xmath4 ( 1.7 pixels ) for all three filters .",
    "features larger than 2.5 - 6.1 parsecs in the sample galaxies are resolved .",
    "the images were initially processed and combined through the hst pipeline routines calacs and multidrizzle .",
    "isophotes were fit to the v images and then applied to the u and nuv images to extract their light profiles ; derived colors are therefore for annular elliptical apertures .",
    "sky background estimates were made from two sources - an average over blank field exposures extracted from the hst archive , and an average over the outer @xmath5 pixels of each galaxy image .",
    "the minimum of the two estimates was used .",
    "the observed images in each band were smoothed with the other two filters psfs , since each psf differs slightly in its substructure .    in this contribution , we discuss only the integrated colors of the galaxies . the total light within a radius of 0.75 @xmath6 of the smoothed images was measured in each band , where @xmath6 is the effective radius measured in the b - band@xcite .",
    "the colors were corrected for foreground reddening .",
    "the effect of the anomalous central component on integrated colors was checked by masking out the central 0.015 @xmath6 and remeasuring the fluxes .",
    "the deviations were less than 0.013 mag in both the nuv - v and u - v colors .",
    "we use the pgase stellar population synthesis models @xcite to interpret the galaxy colors .",
    "spectral energy distributions ( seds ) are available for a pre - determined grid of ages , @xmath7 , and metallicities , z , in the form of monochromatic luminosities per unit mass , [ _ s_]=(erg / s / /@xmath8 ) .",
    "these were computed for an instantaneous burst with a salpeter initial mass function @xcite over the mass range of @xmath9 .",
    "we select the subset of models that covers the age range of 10 myr to 15 gyr and the 3 highest metallicities , z=[0.4,1,2.5]@xmath10 .",
    "the synthetic seds were integrated over the hst bandpasses to get total normalized luminosities for each age and metallicity .    to interpret our photometry",
    ", we compare the locations of the galaxy colors to the pgase single - generation models and also to simple dual - generation models made up of an old population of age @xmath11 and a young population of age @xmath12 that contributes a fraction of the total mass of the galaxy @xmath13 .",
    "we assume that the old and young populations have the same metallicity .",
    "our grid of mixed models is computed as follows :    @xmath14    where @xmath13 evenly covers the log fraction space between @xmath15 to @xmath16 .",
    "most of the models assume @xmath17 gyr .",
    "note that a single - generation stellar population corresponds to the case @xmath18 .",
    "figures 1 and 2 compare the integrated galaxy colors to the single- and dual - generation stellar population models . in figure 1 ,",
    "the single - generation models are plotted as open symbols connected by solid lines and the galaxies as solid diamonds and circles .",
    "the plot provides a consistency check on the photometry and the models in the sense that no objects lie significantly below or to the right of the single - generation model locus ; this region is `` forbidden '' to composite populations . the locus corresponding to simple mixed - metallicity models  i.e.  populations of a small age range ( say 10 - 12 gyr ) but a large range of z  is narrow and closely follows the single - generation line .    in figure 2 ,",
    "the single - generation populations are shown again along with tracks of dual - generation populations for a 12 gyr old population and five younger components ( 10 myr [ solid lines ] , 100 myr , 400 myr , 1 gyr , 4 gyr [ dashed lines ] ) .",
    "the locus for the 10 myr component represents an upper envelope to the region that is consistent with a dual - generation model for a given old population age .",
    "the sensitivity of the nuv to small amounts of light from young populations is indicated by the large volume of color - color space enclosed within the upper envelopes . in general , many dual - generation models are consistent with a given data point in this region , but limits can be placed on their components .",
    "only two galaxies , ngc 3377 and ngc 3384 , have colors which are consistent with single - generation populations , and these require @xmath19 .",
    "all of the other galaxies require mixed - generation populations .",
    "eight of these require a dominant population with @xmath20 , assuming no components can be older than 12 gyr .",
    "the corresponding limit for ngc 4482 and ngc 4239 is @xmath21 . to exemplify the stellar population mixture interpretations",
    ", we find 3 galaxies ( ngcs 2778 , 4478 , and 4570 ) are well described by old , supersolar populations mixed with young components of ages 250 , 500 , and 450 myr , and total mass contributions of 0.4 , 1.5 , and 1.2@xmath22 , respectively .",
    "our basic result is that most of the galaxies show strong evidence of a composite population with contributions from components much younger than 10 - 12 gyr .",
    "this is expected if most early type galaxies have formed by mergers over extended periods .",
    "interestingly , this is true whether or not the galaxies possess excess central light suggestive of a late merger event ( filled circles versus diamonds in figs . 1 & 2 ) .",
    "although the three largest departures from the single generation locus occur for excess light systems ( ngcs 4239 , 4482 , and 7457 ) , the uv / optical color properties of the other members of the two groups are similar . the colors also show that , because the excess central light feature does not affect the total integrated colors , the new stars formed during a merger event are far more efficiently mixed throughout the merger remnant than the numerical models predict @xcite .",
