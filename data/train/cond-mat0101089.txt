    "the study of systems with a small number ( @xmath0 ) of electrons confined to a quasi two - dimensional ( 2d ) semiconductor quantum dot ( qd ) constitutes a subject of growing interest ( see for instance refs . and references therein ) .",
    "one reason for this interest is that their electronic properties can be selected with some freedom by tailoring the shape of the lateral confining potential . in this sense",
    ", they are often referred to as artificial atoms .",
    "recently , circular and elliptically disk - shaped qd s have been built in a very clean way , and their properties have been thoroughly studied @xcite as a function of @xmath0 .    usually , qd s are described as true 2d systems .",
    "this seems justified , as it has been widely tested by comparing theory with experiment .",
    "however , this comparison may be obscured by the fact that the parameters defining the confining potential are adjusted and might mask 3d effects . however , complex 2d calculations have been carried out without further restrictions or imposed symmetries .",
    "@xcite full 3d calculations also exist in the hartree or hartree - fock ( hf ) approximations for very few electrons ( see for instance refs . ) , and also within the density functional theory.@xcite    a systematic study of the role of dimensionality in qd structure has been presented by rontani et al.@xcite in spite of the success of 2d models in describing the properties of qd s subjected to perpendicular magnetic fields , the width in the growth direction of most experimentally studied qd s is around one order of magnitude smaller than their typical radius .",
    "the effect of a small but finite vertical extension on the qd structure is worth studying considering that a recent extension of single qd studies to vertically coupled quantum dots@xcite may render including the @xmath1 extension of the constituent dots unavoidable to describe the experimental data.@xcite    vertically coupled dots , also called artificial or quantum dot molecules , have been theoretically addressed in a number of works . @xcite only in ref . has the @xmath1 extension of",
    "the constituent qd s been taken into account ; in the other references , it was neglected and consequently , their results can not be reliable when the interdot distance is comparable to their @xmath1 extension , which is an interesting physical situation.@xcite    in this work we present a study of vertically coupled , cylindrical qd s in the local spin - density functional theory ( lsdft ) .",
    "we restrict our description to axially symmetric configurations and identical qd s , and limit ourselves to zero magnetic field @xmath2 .",
    "while these two latter conditions are easy to relax without increasing the amount of numerical work too much , axial symmetry breaking would require a more demanding 3d calculation .",
    "our scheme is based on the application of the so - called@xcite imaginary - time method ( itm ) .",
    "it requires a discretization of the kohn - sham ( ks ) equations on a spatial mesh that can be straightforwardly implemented on a personal computer , and avoids expansion of the single - particle ( sp ) wave functions in a basis , large matrix diagonalizations and tests of the stability of the results against changes in the size of the basis .",
    "in contrast to standard methods for computing molecular structure @xcite , we do not postulate from the start that the artificial molecular orbitals can be expressed as linear combinations of artificial atomic orbitals ( lcaao ) and consequently , we avoid making approximations such as complete neglect of differential overlap ( cndo ) where the individual wave functions of electrons associated with different artificial atoms are taken as being orthonormal , as happens when the qd s are either two dimensional or far apart .    the present approach to the description of",
    "vertically coupled qd s constitutes a clear improvement on previous lsdft calculations@xcite in which the electrons are located on one of the dots , and as a consequence , can only be electrostatically coupled , even when they lie at short distances . with respect to the generalized hubbard model plus the diagonalization scheme of ref .",
    ", the present improvement is the possible application of lsdft to systems with large numbers of electrons .",
    "moreover , one could think of a trivial generalization to non - identical dots , paying the well known token that lsdft treats the exchange coulomb term locally , and that lsdft configurations are usually mixtures of many - electron states with the same value of the total spin projection @xmath3 , however , with different total spin @xmath4 . for small systems ,",
    "this drawback ( which is also inherent to the generalized hubbard approach@xcite ) can be removed with a shell - model calculation in a restricted sp valence space.@xcite another difference between our approach and the hubbard model is that even if the exchange energy is treated locally , it is not restricted to involving only electrons located on the same dot .",
    "this might be advantageous in the strong coupling case when the dots are close together and the quantum mechanical coupling due to electron exchange is important .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present the formalism and the essentials of the itm .",
    "results for one single thick qd and for two coupled dots are presented in section iii , and a summary is presented in section iv . in an appendix we present the self - interaction correction@xcite to the density functional results obtained for two extreme interdot distances and several electron numbers .",
    "within lsdft , the ground - state of the system is obtained by solving the kohn - sham equations .",
    "the problem is simplified by the imposed axial symmetry around the @xmath1 axis , which allows one to write the sp wave functions as @xmath5 with @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the projection of the sp orbital angular momentum on the symmetry axis .",
    "we have used effective atomic units @xmath81 , where @xmath9 is the dielectric constant , and @xmath10 the electron effective mass . in units of the bare electron mass",
    "@xmath11 one has @xmath12 . in this system ,",

    "this space discretization scheme offers an efficient calculation of sp wave functions , thus of the electron densities and direct coulomb and exchange - correlation potentials .",
    "the imaginary time method is described in detail in ref . .",
    "it is based on the observation that the discretized time - evolution operator @xmath46 for the time - dependent ks equations    @xmath47    which formally yields    @xmath48    where @xmath49 is the time step and @xmath50 indicates the step iteration , for imaginary @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) produces a decrease of the ks energy . in imaginary time , the wave functions @xmath53 are no longer orthonormal , and a gram - schmidt orthonormalization has to be carried out after each iteration to obtain @xmath54 from @xmath53 . to first order in @xmath55 , eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) becomes    @xmath56    which shows the simplicity of the method and its practical implementation : after discretizing the ks hamiltonian and wave functions , it essentially reduces to repeated application of the ks hamiltonian to the previous wave functions .",

    "one needs a set of sp wave functions and energies to build the initial sp level scheme .",
    "we have used two such sets .",
    "the first consists of the wave functions of an axially symmetric , 3d harmonic oscillator potential of frequencies @xmath35 and @xmath61 in the radial and @xmath1 directions , respectively .",
    "this potential gives rise to analytical solutions even in the presence of a constant magnetic field in the @xmath1 direction , and is a suitable confining potential for a single qd . in this case , the sp hamiltonian is separable and the wave function can be written as @xmath62 with @xmath63 where @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 and @xmath67 are generalized laguerre and hermite polynomials@xcite , respectively .",
    "the sp energies are @xmath68 +   \\hbar \\omega_z [ n_z + 1/2]$ ] with @xmath69 and @xmath70 equal to 0 , 1 ,     for a double qd , we have found it convenient to choose @xmath71 as the lowest energy eigenfunctions of a 1d double quantum well .",
    "the qd thickness is such that for not too many electrons , only the two lowest states are needed .",
    "if the double dot is symmetric , these solutions are either even or odd under reflection @xmath72 .",
    "actually , for one qd , @xmath71 can also be the wave function in the 1d quantum well .    both for a single qd and for a symmetric double dot ,",
    "the single - electron wave functions are characterized by the values of @xmath73 , @xmath74 and parity , i.e. , they must be either symmetric or antisymmetric under inversion @xmath75 , and be either even or odd when reflecting @xmath72 .",
    "all these symmetries are included in the starting separable wave functions .",
    "indeed , the hermite polynomials are even or odd depending on @xmath70 , and the parity of a sp level is simply @xmath76 . as the ks hamiltonian and the itm preserve these symmetries , in the course of the iteration procedure the sp wave functions , which are no longer separable , keep their initial quantum numbers ( orbital and spin projection on the @xmath1 axis , parity and reflection symmetry with respect to the @xmath77 plane ) which are conserved quantities .",
    "to check the numerical scheme we have carried out extensive and systematic tests . a first test on the discretization and iteration procedure consisted in numerically solving an axially deformed harmonic oscillator potential",
    "we have exactly reproduced the spectrum @xmath78 given after eqs .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) .",
    "the implementation of the cgm has been successfully tested comparing results computed for a spherical gaussian charge distribution with the analytical distributions .    as another test of the numerical code ,",
    "we have compared the total energy calculated from a straightforward integration of the energy density with the expression in terms of the sp energies derived from the ks equations .",

    "it might be interesting to remark that most of this disagreement arises from the integral of the external confining potential for a quantum well in the @xmath1 direction , due to the sharp discontinuity in the given potential .",
    "we have checked that for a parabolic confining potential in the @xmath1 direction , both methods of evaluating the total energy agree to within one part in @xmath88 .    in the case of double qd s",
    ", we have also checked that the results coincide irrespective of whether we start the iteration from pure harmonic oscillator wave functions , or from the better choice of double quantum well eigenfunctions in the @xmath1 direction . for even-@xmath0 systems",
    "we have always started the iteration with non - identical sp potentials for spin - up and spin - down electrons , to avoid artificial configurations with @xmath89 .",
    "we have first addressed the addition energies of one quantum dot hosting up to @xmath90 electrons .",
    "the confining potential in the @xmath1 direction is a quantum well @xmath91 nm wide , which corresponds to the experimental well@xcite , and @xmath92 mev deep.@xcite electrons are laterally confined by the parabolic potential @xmath93 for which we have tried different @xmath35 values .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the addition spectrum @xmath94 for @xmath35 = 3 , 5 , and 10 mev .",
    "in addition to local maxima at shell filling values @xmath0 = 2 , 6 , 12 , and 20 , other peaks appear at half - filling values @xmath0 = 4 and 9 .",
    "this is a consequence of hund s rule , which establishes that degenerate electronic states in a shell are filled with parallel spins up to half - shell , in order to maximize the exchange interaction .",
    "up to @xmath0 = 12 the results look very similar to the experimental values@xcite , especially for medium and weak @xmath40-confinement . for larger @xmath0 values",
    "we have found a conspicuous even - odd effect , instead of the weak maxima experimentally found at @xmath0 = 20 , and especially at @xmath0 = 16 .",
    "this result does not mean that hund s rule is violated within this shell .",
    "indeed , we have found spin alignment up to @xmath0 = 16 , but the associated energy gain is not enough to produce the local maximum at @xmath0 = 16 . it is worth pointing out that the energies involved in the definition of @xmath95 are very large , compared with the second energy difference .",
    "for example , for @xmath35 = 5 mev , @xmath96 = 1.048 ev , whereas @xmath97 is @xmath98 3 mev .    for strong @xmath40-confinement ,",
    "our results are quite similar to those in ref . , except for medium and small values .",
    "this is not surprising , since in this ref .",
    "the 3d electron - electron energy is treated in first - order perturbation theory@xcite , thus one should not expect it to hold if the confinement is not strong enough . the two - dimensional @xmath99 results at @xmath2 = 0 coincide with those in ref . when @xmath35 = 5 mev .",
    "our 3d dot is rather strongly confined in the @xmath1 direction , and the results for @xmath95 are similar to those obtained for pure 2d dots . we have computed the addition energies using the 2d dot model described in detail in ref . ; as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , 2d and 3d results are very similar and qualitatively better than those from other different 2d models . @xcite as one increases the confinement in the @xmath1 direction up to @xmath100 = 300 mev , the addition energies become indistinguishable in the scale of fig .",
    "we shall see that this is not the case for double dots , and that even qualitative differences appear if the dots are strongly coupled .    in spite of this quasi two - dimensional behaviour , the electron density spreads beyond the well up to distances that are relevant for vertically coupled dots .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , where we have plotted the @xmath101 electron density defined as    @xmath102    corresponding to @xmath0= 12 , @xmath103= 12 nm , and @xmath100 = 200 and 300 mev [ notice that @xmath104 .",
    "the electron densities spill out of the quantum well , the smaller the confinement , the larger the effect .    finally , in fig .",

    "these radial densities are very similar .",
    "the 3d densities @xmath105 for @xmath108 mev , instead of 200 mev , are indistinguishable within the scale of the figure .",
    "these comparisons allow one to infer that the experimental dots are quasi two - dimensional systems to a large extent , with moderate lateral confinement , @xmath109 5 mev .",
    "we have modelled a symmetric double dot by a parabolic confining potential with frequency @xmath35 = 5 mev in the @xmath40 direction , and a symmetric double quantum well in the @xmath1 direction .",
    "each quantum well has a width equal to 12 nm , and is separated from the other by a barrier of thickness @xmath110 that varies from 1 to 9 nm .",
    "some experimental results are available@xcite for this system at @xmath111 2.5 nm .",
    "results for well depths @xmath100 = 200 and 300 mev will be discussed .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows the @xmath101 density profiles corresponding to a quantum - mechanically coupled configuration ( @xmath110 = 2.5 nm ) , and to an electrostatically coupled configuration ( @xmath110 = 7.5 nm ) . only in the former case ,",
    "are the electrons delocalized . a quantitative measure of this localization is provided by the energy splitting between symmetric and antisymmetric sp states ( more precisely between even and odd states with respect to specular reflection @xmath72 ) , @xmath112 .",

    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] that for a given interdot distance , enlarging @xmath100 decreases the coupling between the dots , as the density overlap diminishes .",

    "figure [ fig8 ] shows the addition spectrum for quantum mechanically coupled ( @xmath110 = 2.5 nm ) , and electrostatically coupled ( @xmath110 = 7.5 nm ) dots , as well as the results corresponding to the single 3d dot .",

    "however , the experimental analysis@xcite of the derivative of the drain intensity with respect to the drain voltage versus drain voltage indicates that the electrons in the dots are indeed delocalized for @xmath110 = 2.5 nm , and rather localized for @xmath110 = 7.5 nm .    the weak coupling at @xmath110 = 7.5 nm allows us to interpret the appearance of several peaks in @xmath95 , such as those at @xmath0 = 4 , 8 and 12 , as due to the fact that 2 , 4 , and 6 electrons on each dot already yield maxima in the addition spectrum of a single qd .",
    "the remaining peak at @xmath0 = 2 corresponds now to half - filling the first shell in each dot , which would close at @xmath0 = 2 .",

    "we have not attempted to use @xmath100 as a fitting parameter , so when comparing with experiment one should bear in mind both the sensitivity of @xmath95 on the value of @xmath100 in the strong coupling limit and the results displayed in figs .",

    "this feature is not reproduced by the calculations .",
    "globally , the results for @xmath110 = 2.5 nm are better reproduced with @xmath100 = 200 mev up to @xmath0 = 12 , and with @xmath100 = 300 mev for larger @xmath0 values .",

    "initially , @xmath125 increases with @xmath110 .",
    "the reason is twofold . on the one hand , at small @xmath110",
    "all occupied sp levels are specularly symmetric about the @xmath1 = 0 plane @xmath126 states ) , the specularly antisymmetric levels @xmath127 states ) lie at much higher energies ( see fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) . on the other hand",
    ", the energies of the symmetric and antisymmetric state respectively increase and decrease with @xmath110 , and eventually both states become degenerate at large interdot distances .",
    "this is a well - known feature of the one particle , one - dimensional double quantum well problem ( see insert in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) , which remains valid in the interacting many - electron calculation .",
    "the first phase transition takes place when the first antisymmetric sp state becomes occupied . at large distances ,",
    "@xmath125 slowly decreases with @xmath110 due to the decrease of the interdot coulomb energy .",
    "these trends are also present in the hubbard - like calculations of ref . , but only the lowering of @xmath125 due to the interdot coulomb energy is qualitatively reproduced by the calculations of ref . , which fail to yield the energy growth at short distances .    in spite of the difference between the values of the gs energies reported in refs . , and also with respect to the present work , which has to be mostly attributed to the different confining potentials in each calculation , up to @xmath0 = 6 the phases are the same but appear at different @xmath110 values . in this respect ,",
    "our results are in closer agreement with those of ref . , possibly because the radial frequencies @xmath35 are similar in both calculations .",
    "we wish to point out that the phase diagram obtained for @xmath100 = 300 mev is qualitatively similar to the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , but the phase transitions are shifted @xmath128 0.5 nm to the left .",
    "we have used local spin - density functional theory to investigate the zero magnetic field structure of one single and two identical , vertically coupled qd s of finite thickness .",
    "while for one single dot , whose thickness corresponds to that of actual experimental devices , the addition spectrum is quite similar to that predicted by purely two - dimensional models , in the case of double dots , their vertical extension , is essential for a quantitative description of their quantum coupling , which influences the addition spectrum at short distances . for one single dot",
    "the calculated addition spectrum compares well with experiment , whereas for two coupled dots the agreement is qualitative .",
    "this possibly reflects the fact that in the latter case the spectrum is more sensitive to the actual form of the bare confining potential .",
    "the phase sequence of ground state configurations which appear as a function of interdot distance is quite similar to that found in previous works@xcite , evolving from the ` atomic phase ' of two strongly coupled dots to the ` atomic phase ' of two weakly coupled dots through a series of ` molecular - type phases ' at intermediate distances .",
    "this is a rather robust picture , as it arises from the underlying single - electron structure of the bare confining potential .",
    "indeed , the vertical confinement is so strong that at short distances only symmetric sp states are occupied , the antisymmetric ones lying at quite high energies .",
    "this originates the atomic phase of two strongly coupled dots . as the interdot distance increases the @xmath112 gap decreases , and the symmetric and antisymmetric sp states eventually become degenerate , originating the atomic phase of two weakly coupled dots .",
    "the molecular - type configurations appear at intermediate distances where @xmath112 is similar to the other energy scale of the system , namely @xmath129 , and when the number of electrons is large enough so that the system can minimize its energy populating antisymmetric states .",
    "the larger the number of electrons , the larger the number of populated antisymmetric states .",
    "this causes the number of intermediate molecular phases to increase with @xmath0 .    in spite of the mentioned qualitative agreement with previous results , the calculated phase diagrams are as sensitive to the shape of the bare confining potential as the addition spectra . it would be desirable that any prediction of the actual appearance of the phase diagrams should be based on a model that describes , at least qualitatively , the corresponding experimental addition spectrum",
    "it is a pleasure to thank alfredo poves , flavio toigo , and especially guy austing for useful discussions .",
    "this work has been performed under grants pb98 - 1247 and pb98 - 0124 of the dgesic , and sgr98 - 00011 of the generalitat of catalunya .",

    "it is well known that the ` exact ' density functional for the gs energy is self - interaction - free ( see for instance ref . ) , but it is not the case of its current approximations , such as lsdft .",
    "one possible way of removing this drawback is to use the self - interaction correction ( sic ) proposed by perdew and zunger@xcite , which introduces an orbital - dependent single - particle potential , that improves the total energy of the electronic system and yields sp eigenvalues which approximate the physical removal energies more closely , at the price of rendering the ks minimization far more cumbersome .",
    "since sic s are relatively more important for few electron systems , which is the present case , we have tested their effect on the results shown in the body of this paper , in two extreme configurations .",
    "we refer the reader to refs . and for a thorough description of sic . here",
    "we only give the essential details of the application of the method to our physical problem .        where @xmath131 is the ` orbital density ' and @xmath132 $ ] is obtained solving the poisson equation @xmath133 = - 4 \\pi\\ , n_{nl\\sigma}(r , z)$ ] as indicated in section ii .",
    "after selfconsistency is achieved , the total energy can be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq12 ] ) , which has been written as      we have drawn in fig . [ figa1 ] the difference between sic and lsdft addition energies defined as @xmath135 corresponding to the @xmath100 = 200 mev double quantum dot .",
    "the average difference is small , of the order of 0.4 - 0.5 mev .",
    "this difference almost cancels out in the addition spectrum @xmath95 , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ figa2 ] .",
    "it constitutes an interesting result in itself , indicating that if one only wishes to obtain the addition spectrum , lsdft does not need to be corrected for self - interaction effects .",
