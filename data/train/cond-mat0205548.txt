    "the hamiltonians of the so - called strongly correlated electron systems describe in fact multicomponent gases of quasiparticle excitations in a crystal .",
    "the components are labeled , by orbital and/or spin degrees of freedom , for instance . as",
    "a rule , revealing cooperative phenomena in such systems , like long - range orders , is a hard task .",
    "then , in the course of studies , one simplifies the hamiltonian by discarding some labels of quasiparticles , setting some coupling constants to zero and sending other to infinity .",
    "simultaneously , one looses possibilities of accounting for some physics .",
    "but once a sufficient level of understanding of a simplified model is reached , a reverse process starts .",
    "this might be a brief history of the falicov  kimball model ( and only to some extent of the hubbard model ) studies .",
    "the original model put forward by falicov and kimball @xcite refers to two groups of quasiparticles excitations , called localized holes and itinerant electrons , with the members of each group labeled by band and spin indices",
    ". only a few , out of many , on - site interactions of these quasiparticles are retained and the strength of the on - site hole  hole repulsion is sent to infinity @xcite .",
    "the extreme simplification of this model , that consists of one band of spinless electrons and of spinless holes , is known as the _ spinless falicov  kimball model_. in contradistinction to the case of hubbard model , it has been possible to demonstrate , without uncontrollable approximations , that the spinless falicov  kimball model exhibits a staggered long - range order @xcite .",
    "subsequent research extended considerably this result and supplied us with a fairly broad knowledge of the phase diagram .",
    "naturally , the strongest results have been obtained at zero temperature ( see @xcite for more details and an extensive list of references ) .",
    "then , one observes a resurgence of interest in effects of additional degrees of freedom and additional interactions between localized particles .",
    "most attention has been paid to effects related to spin degrees of freedom .",
    "thus models , where the localized and intinerant quasiparticles carry spin-@xmath1 @xcite have been investigated . in @xcite a finite repulsion between localized particles with opposite spins",
    "has been included .",
    "quite recently , it was argued that an interesting physics could be accounted for by multicomponent falicov ",
    "kimball models @xcite . as a preliminary step ,",
    "a kind of falicov  kimball model with @xmath2 components of itinerant particles and @xmath3 components of localized ones was solved exactly in the limit of infinite dimensions . concerning interactions between localized particles ,",
    "only an on - site repulsion between different components of localized particles was included and its strength was sent to infinity , thereby restricting the space of states available for the system .",
    "unlike in the quoted above papers on the spin-@xmath1 case , @xmath4 may not be equal to @xmath5 .",
    "the _ multicomponent falicov  kimball models _ , we referred to above , belong to a class of systems whose generic hamiltonian is of the form @xmath6 the first sum , over @xmath7-components of itinerant fermions ( later on called briefly _ electrons _ ) , accounts for their hopping .",
    "the second sum , over lattice sites @xmath8 , @xmath7-components of electrons and @xmath9-components of localized particles ( later on called _ ions _ ) , represents the usual falicov  kimball - like coupling between the itinerant and localized particles . with @xmath10 ,",
    "@xmath11 being the occupation number operators at site @xmath8 of @xmath7-electrons and @xmath9-ions , respectively , it contributes the energy @xmath12 if and only if the site @xmath8 is occupied by a @xmath7-electron and an @xmath9-ion .",
    "the third term , @xmath13 , stands for an interaction between ions , diagonal in their occupation - number representation .",
    "therefore , the system described by the hamiltonian @xmath14 can be looked upon as a multicomponent classical gas ( of ions ) coupled to a multicomponent free - fermion gas ( of electrons ) .    in the main body of this paper",
    "we study an instance of ( [ intro1 ] ) with a _ component - wise coupling _ between the electrons and ions , i.e. ,  we set @xmath15 .",
    "the component - wise coupling may appear naturally in situations , where the components differ significantly in their physical characteristics .",
    "actually , we make the coupling component - independent , @xmath16 for all @xmath7 , and assume equal number of electrons and ions components , for simplicity .",
    "if @xmath13 involves only finite - range interactions that admit a representation in terms of a m - potential @xcite , then some aspects of the ground state of the model , defined by @xmath14 , concerned with the distribution of ions on the underlying lattice , can readily be investigated by the methods developed in @xcite .    however",
    ", if the itinerant and localized particles are interpreted as different sorts of electrons , as is the case in the original paper by falicov and kimball , and the coupling between electrons stands for a screened coulomb repulsion , then an _ ion - independent coupling _ , i.e. ,  @xmath17 , becomes more appropriate .",
    "such a coupling has been studied rigorously in @xcite and in the limit of infinite dimensions in @xcite .",
    "the multicomponent falicov ",
    "kimball models with ion - independent coupling will be the subject of our subsequent paper .    in the next section we provide necessary details and properties of our model with the component - wise coupling , as well as definitions useful in considerations of ground - state phase diagrams in the grand - canonical ensemble .",
    "then , in section 3 we study the ground - state phase diagram at the hole ",
    "particle symmetry point in the plane of chemical potentials of electrons and ions , for arbitrary strength @xmath18 of the electron  ion coupling .",
    "after that , in section 4 we go beyond the hole  particle symmetry point , but only in the strong - coupling regime .",
    "finally , in section 5 , we provide a summary and discussion of the obtained results .",
    "in the sequel we study a version of the model ( [ intro1 ] ) specified as follows .",
    "the underlying finite lattice @xmath19 , consisting of @xmath20 sites , is assumed to be a piece of a @xmath21-dimensional hypercubic lattice @xmath22 , such that it can be partitioned into two congruent sublattices : the even sublattice , @xmath23 , and the odd sublattice , @xmath24 .",
    "each site of @xmath19 has @xmath25 nearest neighbours . then",
    ", the nearest - neighbour sites of a site in @xmath23 belong to @xmath24 and vice versa .",
    "we shall use the notation @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28  , @xmath29 , to denote the first and the @xmath30-th nearest neighbours on @xmath19 , that is the unordered pairs of sites whose euclidean distance in the units of the lattice constant are @xmath31 , for @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "consequently , @xmath33 will stand for the summation over all the @xmath30-th nearest - neighbour pairs of sites , with each pair counted once .    the quantum subsystem , consisting of @xmath34 different kinds of itinerant particles ( electrons ) labelled by @xmath35 , is described in terms of creation and annihilation operators of a @xmath7-electron at site @xmath36 : @xmath37 , @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "the operators @xmath39 satisfy the canonical anticommutation relations .",
    "then , the hopping of @xmath7-electrons is specified by : @xmath40 with @xmath41 being the nearest - neighbour hopping intensity .",
    "another relevant observable is the total electron - number operator @xmath42 , where @xmath7-electron - number operators @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the classical subsystem consists also of @xmath34 different kinds of particles ( localized ions ) .",
    "the states of this subsystem can be described by a collection of particle - occupation numbers @xmath45 , with @xmath46 ( no two ions occupying the same site can be of the same kind ) , called the _",
    "ion configurations_. the total number of ions is @xmath47 , where the numbers of @xmath7-ions @xmath48 . in contradistinction to the electron subsystem , we introduce a direct ion - ion interaction .",
    "each pair of ions occupying a site contributes the energy @xmath49 .",
    "moreover , two ions that occupy two nearest - neighbour sites repell each other , contributing the energy @xmath50 .",
    "thus , the ion  ion interaction hamiltonian , @xmath13 , reads @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 stands for the summation over unordered pairs of indices @xmath54 , each pair being counted once .",
    "clearly , in the composite system , whose hamiltonian is given by ( [ intro1 ] ) , ( [ model1 ] ) and ( [ model2 ] ) ( with arbitrary matrix @xmath12 ) , the particle - number operators @xmath55 ( hence @xmath56 ) are conserved .",
    "the peculiarity of this system is that the site - occupation numbers @xmath57 ( hence @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) are also conserved and therefore the description of the classical subsystem in terms of the ion configurations @xmath60 remains valid .",
    "finally , the coupling between the classical and quantum subsystems is chosen to be the component - wise one , with @xmath61 this concludes the specification of our system .    in what follows , we shall study the ground - state phase diagram of the system defined by ( [ intro1])([model3 ] ) , in the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "ultimately , this task amounts to determining at each point @xmath62 of the plane of chemical potentials of electrons and ions , respectively , the lowest energy eigensubspace of the hamiltonian @xmath63 actually , our purposes will be more restricted .",
    "namely , we shall be interested only in determining the set of periodic ground - state configurations of ions at each point in the @xmath64 plane .    in studies of grand - canonical phase diagrams an important role is played by unitary transformations that exchange particles and holes : @xmath65 and @xmath66 , and for some @xmath67 leave the hamiltonian @xmath68 invariant . for the electron subsystem of ( [ model4 ] ) such a role",
    "is played by the transformations : @xmath69 , with @xmath70 . at the hole ",
    "particle symmetry point , @xmath71 , the system under consideration has very special properties , which facilitate studies of its phase diagram ( among them is the property that the grand - canonical expectations of @xmath72 assume the value of @xmath1 , independently of temperature ) .",
    "one easily finds that this system is hole ",
    "particle invariant at the point @xmath73 , where @xmath74 for future purposes , it is convenient to introduce the shifted chemical potentials @xmath75 the new hamiltonian @xmath76 , and express @xmath77 as follows @xmath78 @xmath79 @xmath80    the second equalities in ( [ model5 - 2 ] , [ model5 - 3 ] ) hold up to a term which is independent of the particle states .",
    "the hamiltonians @xmath81 and @xmath82 are invariant with respect to the hole  particle transformation , consequently @xmath83 is hole ",
    "particle invariant at the point @xmath84 .",
    "we define @xmath85 to be the ground - state energy of @xmath77 for a given configuration of ions @xmath86 .",
    "then the ground - state energy of the hamiltonian @xmath87 , denoted @xmath88 , is @xmath89 , and the minimum is attained at the set @xmath90 of the ground - state configurations of ions .",

    "the two - component classical system considered in section 4 and given by the hamiltonian @xmath187 is well known in the literature of strongly correlated electron systems as the atomic limit of the extended hubbard model .",
    "a lot of effort has been devoted to studies of its phase diagram , see for instance @xcite and references quoted there .",
    "when the two kinds of ions involved ( in the context of hubbard - like models they are interpreted as localized electrons with spin up or down ) are allowed to hop , we arrive at the extended hubbard model .",
    "this model is , since many years , a subject of vigorous research .",
    "one of the intriguing questions asked is what is the effect of hopping on the phases of localized electrons ( determined in the atomic limit ) .",
    "it is widely known that the second - order perturbation theory , with respect to hopping , predicts that the ground - state configurations with only singly occupied sites ( inside domain @xmath162 ) are ordered antiferromagnetically by a weak hopping .",
    "brandt and stolze have shown @xcite that the prediction for the phase with density @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) , inside domain @xmath163 ( @xmath166 ) , is that it is ordered ferromagnetically by a weak hopping , what results in coexistence of charge and magnetic orders .",
    "thus , according to the second - order perturbation theory the quantum fluctuations , introduced by the hopping , remove the spin degeneracy present in the ground - state phases of localized electrons . in this paper",
    "we address an analogous problem . in our case",
    "however , the direct quantum fluctuations introduced by the hopping of the ions are replaced by the indirect ones , introduced by the hopping of an extra quantum system of free electrons coupled to the classical system of ions in a falicov  kimball way . in this new set up , the effect of quantum fluctuations due to the hopping could have been studied rigorously . in section 3 , we have considered only the hole  particle symmetry point . for any strength of the coupling between electrons and ions and any hopping , we obtained that the ground - state configurations of singly occupied sites ( when there is no hopping of electrons ) , become antiferromagnetically ordered upon switching the hopping .",
    "this result agrees with the predictions of the perturbation theory for the extended hubbard model .",
    "however , far away of the symmetry point , inside the domains @xmath163 ( @xmath166 ) , where without hopping the ground - state configurations are spin degenerate , we also find an antiferromagnetic order upon switching the hopping .",
    "this result is in contrast with the predictions of the perturbation theory for the extended hubbard model .",
    "one of the authors ( v.d . ) is grateful to the university of wrocaw , and especially to the institute of theoretical physics for financial support .",
