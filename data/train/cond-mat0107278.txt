    "[ crystal.hosno ] . when spins interact via a ferromagnetic nearest - neighbor exchange - interaction and have strong local ising - anisotropies which force each spin to point into or out - of the center of each tetrahedron , spin configurations of the ground - state on one tetrahedron are sixfold degenerate `` two - in and two - out '' structures ( see fig .  [ crystal.hosno ] ) .",
    "by extending this `` two - in - two - out '' structure to the entire pyrochlore lattice , it was shown that ground state degeneracy is macroscopic , which leads to the residual entropy @xcite at @xmath4 = 0 . since these spin configurations can be mapped to proton configurations in the cubic ice , @xcite the system is called as the spin ice model .",

    "@xcite    although the strong ising - like anisotropies of ho and dy moments are obvious , the spin - spin interactions have certain ambiguity , because these large moments systems have significant contribution from dipolar interaction @xcite in addition to the nearest - neighbor exchange - interaction .",
    "the long - range nature of the dipolar interaction complicates the real spin - ice systems , and another theoretical problem of a dipolar spin - ice model @xcite has been addressed .",

    "this contradiction is thought to be solved by slow spin dynamics in the macroscopic number of low energy states belonging to the `` two - in - two - out '' manifold of the spin ice model , which prevents the dipolar spin ice from reaching to thermal equilibrium states .",
