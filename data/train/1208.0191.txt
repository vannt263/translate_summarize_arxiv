    "to tackle the problem of divergences in quantum field theories ( qfts ) the lw theories @xcite assume a lw partner for each sm field .",
    "it turns out that to attack the problem of divergences in qft one has to quantize the lw partners in such a way that their excitations may have indefinite norms in the hilbert space . in the present",
    "talk we will utilize the lw standard model @xcite to investigate the physics of the early universe and we will mainly follow ref .  .",
    "in the toy model it is assumed that each sm field is accompanied by a lw partner . in this simplified picture",
    "the energy density , pressure for each of these partners can be calculated @xcite .",
    "as the lw partner states can have indefinite norm , they are barred to appear as in - states or out - states in any s - matrix process .",
    "the lw partners can only appear as resonances in processes involving sm particles . the lw resonances may thermalize ( in the cosmic plasma ) if the sm particles energies are high i.e. , @xmath0 . if @xmath1 the lw resonances decouple and turn out to be non - thermal .",
    "if @xmath2 is the mass of the maximally massive partner field whose generic mass is @xmath3 which is less than @xmath4 , then the net energy density and entropy density of the relativistic fields in the early universe composed of the sm fields and there lw partners turns out to be , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the effective degree of freedom for energy calculation , and @xmath7 is the effective degree of freedom for entropy calculation . here",
    "it has been assumed that each sm boson ( or fermion ) and its lw partner are in thermal equilibrium but all the different species of particles and their partners may not be sharing the same temperature . in the above relations @xmath2 is the mass of the maximally massive lw partner which is relativistic at temperature @xmath4 .",
    "the above equations for energy density and entropy density are correct if the spectrum of the particles does not contain any massless gauge bosons . in presence of massless gauge bosons , in the realistic model ,",
    "the above relations get modified .    using the above forms of energy density and entropy density",
    "one can show the time - temperature relation for the lw universe to be : @xmath8     gev becomes non - thermal and its position is taken up by the next heaviest lee - wick partner of mass @xmath9 gev . for a simple illustration the effective degrees of freedom",
    "are assumed to remain constant in the process , @xmath10 .",
    "the green region in the plot represents a region of rapid and violent temperature fluctuations where the system has gone out of equilibrium.,width=302,height=377 ]    the time - temperature relation is plotted in fig .",
    "[ tt : f ] .",
    "the bump appears at a specific time in fig .",
    "[ tt : f ] because at that time the heaviest lw partner with mass @xmath2 becomes non - relativistic and the the heaviest mass value in eq .",
    "( [ ttr ] ) is replaced by the next heaviest lw partner mass @xmath11 .",
    "this is an out of equilibrium process as the entropy also shoots up during this time .",
    "as the lw partners become non - relativistic they decouple from the plasma and do not contribute in the energy density or entropy density of the system .",
    "in the realistic model there are two fermionic partners of a standard chiral fermion and there is one more degree of freedom for the massive partners of the massless gauge bosons . in this case : @xmath12 where the new degrees of freedom @xmath13 originates from the standard bosonic contribution .",
    "as there are more lw fermions , the unpaired fermionic contribution comes with @xmath14 . the last term in eq .",
    "( [ energyd2 ] ) arises from the extra longitudinal degree of freedom of the massive lw partners of the normal massless gauge bosons . here",
    "@xmath15 denotes the number of massive vector boson partners of sm gauge bosons . in the last equation",
    "it is assumed that all the species in the plasma are in thermal equilibrium .    in the present scenario",
    "one sees that if there are two lw fermionic partners for each standard fermion and the longitudinal mode of the lw partners of the normal gauge bosons also contribute to the energy density then the net energy density is not positive definite",
    ". there can be two ways in which one can obtain a positive definite energy density of the early universe infested with lw partners .",
    "the first one depends upon the principle of parametric resonance during preheating after inflation @xcite . during these phase only massive bosons",
    "are produced and if these massive bosons initially thermalize during reheating then the problem with the fermions and gauge bosons disappear .",
    "the second option is related to the reheating temperature of the universe .",
    "if the lw fermion partners and the lw partners of the gauge bosons decoupling temperature is more than the reheat temperature then both of these species will not be present in the energy density term and henceforth the energy density will be positive definite .",
    "these scenario depends upon the mass hierarchy of the lw partners .    in conclusion",
    "one can say that a realistic lw radiation dominated universe is a difficult thing to realize but for certain circumstances as discussed above one can indeed have a lw radiation phase during / after reheating .",
