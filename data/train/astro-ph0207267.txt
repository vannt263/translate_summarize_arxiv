    "as in many areas of astronomy , the advent of the hubble space telescope has revolutionised the study of globular clusters . primarily because of crowding ,",
    "ground - based observations of the central regions of globular clusters are limited to brighter stars , at or above the main sequence turnoff .",
    "hst allows access to the study of stellar populations below the turnoff including main sequence stars and white dwarfs .",
    "main - sequence stars below the turnoff in globular clusters ( typically @xmath1 ) have evolved little from their initial zero - age main - sequence ( zams ) state . thus , mass functions derived from globular cluster luminosity functions can be used as indicators of a stellar initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "most notably in recent years , several groups have used hst wfpc2 photometry to probe mass and luminosity functions for several globular clusters down to the hydrogen burning limit .",
    "for example , @xcite have documented the turnover in the luminosity function at @xmath2 for a sample of twelve galactic globular clusters . in ngc",
    "6397 @xcite found that the mass function increases slowly for masses down to 0.1 @xmath0 and then drops rapidly .",
    "although individual globular cluster main sequence stars are little evolved from the zams , the main sequence itself has been subject to modification by cluster dynamical effects .",
    "these include not only intra - cluster effects such as relaxation due to two - body interactions but also tidal interactions between a globular cluster and its galactic environment . relaxation of globular clusters has been studied in detail through dynamical equilibrium models @xcite and through direct numerical n - body simulations @xcite . a comprehensive review of globular cluster dynamics is given by @xcite .",
    "briefly , two - body interactions tend to transfer kinetic energy outward from the core and produce mass segregation , a depletion of the relative fraction of low mass stars in the central regions relative to their proportions outside the core . only since the mid-1990 s has this effect been reliably observed in globular cluster cores , for example in 47 tuc @xcite , ngc 6752 @xcite and ngc 6397 @xcite .",
    "( note that the core of a globular cluster is usually parameterised by the core radius , @xmath3 , defined by @xcite as the scale factor in his empirical formula for the surface density profile . )",
    "the most important external dynamic effect is disk shocking , which tends to strip the lightest stars out of a globular cluster during orbital crossings of the galactic plane .",
    "to best avoid both internal and external dynamical modifications , the stellar luminosity functions in globular clusters should be obtained at radii close to the half - light radius of the cluster @xcite .",
    "a further complication in deriving a global imf is the presence of binary main - sequence stars in a globular cluster .",
    "near - equal - mass binary stars appear on a color - magnitude diagram in a main sequence displaced upwards by 0.75 mag @xcite . in only a few cases , for example",
    "ngc 6752 @xcite , has the photometry been sufficiently precise to resolve this binary main sequence .",
    "normally , the presence of binary stars will contaminate a main - sequence luminosity function , particularly in the core of a cluster where , due to mass segregation effects , the binary fraction is highest . in 47 tuc , @xcite found the fraction of binary stars to be around 13% in the innermost 4 @xmath3 , with some evidence that this fraction was highest ( @xmath4 ) within 1 @xmath3 , dropping to @xmath5 at 2.5 @xmath3 .",
    "such a dropoff was also noted by @xcite in ngc 6752 . for globular clusters showing at least a moderate degree of central concentration , @xmath6 ,",
    "the half - light radius is generally at least several times @xmath3 so luminosity functions derived at the half - light radius should be reasonably free from binary contamination .    in this paper",
    "we derive the luminosity and mass functions for m22 ( ngc 6656 ) , a globular cluster located about one third of the way between the sun and the galactic bulge .",
    "our observations ( taken as part of another program ) are not particularly deep but cover a large spatial area from the center out to several @xmath3 .",
    "our focus is thus on determining the degree of mass segregation in the middle to upper main sequence rather than on probing the lowest mass stars . from four fields that we subdivide into concentric annular radial bins ,",
    "we determine how the luminosity and mass functions change with radius in this cluster .",
    "sections 2 and 3 discuss the data and their reduction . in section 4 and 5",
    "we consider the derivation of the luminosity and mass functions . in section 6",
    "we compare these results with a dynamical model for the cluster .",
    "as part of a program to detect gravitational microlensing events by stars within m22 @xcite , observations were taken during 22 february to 15 june , 1999 , using the wfpc2 camera aboard hst .",
    "the images were taken at 43 epochs , with a typical separation of about 3 days . a subset of 9 images",
    "were taken with a separation of about 1 day , which were dithered at a sub - pixel level .",
    "one additional epoch of observations was taken a year later , on 18 february 2000 . at each epoch , images were taken of three fields ( hereafter referred to as pointings 1 - 3 ) in the central region of m22 .",
    "most of the observations were taken in the i ( f814w ) filter , with every fourth observation in the wide - v ( f606w ) filter . to optimize the overhead and exposure times during a single orbit",
    ", the 3 observed fields were so chosen that they used the same guide stars .",
    "this avoided the overheads involved in switching between guide stars during an orbit , but led to slight overlap between different fields .",
    "the orientation of the images was kept fixed in all the observations . to facilitate cosmic ray removal ,",
    "the images were taken in pairs for each filter , each with an integration time of 260 sec .",
    "for each observed field , the total exposure time is 17160 sec in the f814w filter and 5200 sec in the f606w filter .",
    "the above observations of the central regions of m22 were supplemented with exposures from the hst archive of a field ( hereafter pointing 4 ) at the approximate half - light radius of the cluster , 3.5 southeast of the cluster center .",
    "these consisted of 4@xmath71200  s exposures in f814w and 2@xmath71100  s + 2@xmath71200  s exposures in f606w .",
    "a luminosity function from these datasets was derived by @xcite and later confirmed by @xcite .",
    "we thus have 16 different pointing / ccd combinations listed in table  [ table : ccdfields ] .",
    "the four wfpc2 pointings used for this paper are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : m22area ] relative to the cluster center which we take to be at j2000 coordinates ( 18h36m24.2s,-23@xmath85412  ) from @xcite .",
    "additionally , the hst archival dataset u27xjd01 t was used to establish the luminosity function of the galactic bulge local to m22 .",
    "this archive consists of a single ( non - crsplit ) 2400  s f814w exposure , offset from the center of m22 by approximately 9 arcmin to the southwest .",
    "the data frames were initially put through the standard hst on - the - fly calibration pipeline which involves bias and dark subtraction and flat - field correction . the remaining steps in the photometric reduction process",
    "were done using the hstphot 1.0 package @xcite .",
    "data quality images were used to mask bad pixels and vignetted regions .",
    "pairs of images ( cr - splits ) taken during a single orbit and with the same dither offset and filter were combined for cosmic ray removal .",
    "sky images were then calculated and hot pixels removed .",
    "psf - fitting photometry was done using the multiphot task in hstphot 1.0 .",
    "this program uses the combined signal from all the images at a given pointing for object detection .",
    "we used a detection threshold of 3.0 for the minimum signal - to - noise in the combined images .",
    "this threshold was deliberately set lower than what would eventually be used in the selection of stars for further analysis in order to prevent marginally - detected stars from contaminating the measurements of their neighbours .",
    "the artificial star routine in multiphot generates stars randomly from a 2-dimensional color - magnitude grid specified by the user .",
    "we chose a grid such that @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "these were placed and solved for one at a time on each set of images so that no additional crowding is introduced .",
    "the xy position of each artificial star is chosen randomly , but weighted towards regions with the highest stellar densities in order to best represent the real measurement conditions .",
    "a subset of these artificial stars from each frame ( between 15,000 and 20,000 per frame ) was chosen for comparison with the real stars based on the criterion that their input f606w - f814w color was within 0.1 mag of the main - sequence fiducial line ( see section 4 ) .",
    "charge transfer efficiency corrections were made as described in @xcite .",
    "aperture corrections to the psf photometry were made using 150 - 200 bright and relatively isolated stars on each chip of each image .",
    "the aperture corrections were typically less than 0.01 mag but were as high as @xmath11 0.05 mag for the chips sampling the core of the cluster .",
    "the selection of the final star lists for further analysis was made by imposing a minimum signal - to - noise threshold of 10.0 and making further cuts using sharpness criteria on a chip - by - chip basis .",
    "the sharpness reported by hstphot is defined in @xcite .",
    "a perfectly - fit star has a sharpness of zero , with positive sharpness for stars with a sharper psf than this , and negative for objects with a broader profile .",
    "a completely flat profile has a sharpness value of -1 .",
    "a typical example of selection by object sharpness is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sharpness ] for the wf3 chip of pointing 3 .",
    "the sharpness of all the detected objects found between 60  and 120  from the cluster center with s / n @xmath12 is plotted against f814w magnitude .",
    "( we will use this same sample field for illustrative purposes throughout the paper . )",
    "the left - hand panel shows the real data , the right - hand panel the artificial stars .",
    "selection criteria are made with reference to the measured sharpness of the artificial stars .",
    "the horizontal cuts are made to reject those stars with poorly - fitting psfs , the inclined cut is chosen to reject objects found with low sharpness at fainter magnitudes that do not appear in the artificial star set .",
    "some of these faint detections excluded because of their high negative sharpness are image artifacts , mainly lying on diffraction spikes from saturated stars .",
    "others are believed to be blends of faint stars .",
    "the adopted sharpness cuts for all field / ccd combinations are given in table  [ table : ccdfields ] .    a further correction to the derived f814w and f606w wfpc2 flight system magnitudes was made to correct a trend with sharpness noticed in the artificial star data .",
    "[ fig : sharpmag ] shows the difference between input and output magnitudes plotted against sharpness for the artificial stars from the same pointing-3 wf3 field as above .",
    "this effect is present ( with the same slope ) for all fields , but as we look farther away from the core the proportion of stars with non - zero sharpness decreases and thus it becomes much less significant .",
    "the proportion of stars with non - zero sharpness is also much greater for fainter stars .",
    "the origin of the effect can be understood as being due to extreme crowding in the central regions of the cluster . in effect , the background is not the true sky but rather a lumpy morass of undetected stars .",
    "the center of a faint , undetected star is more likely to lie in the wings of a brighter ( detected ) star then on its central pixel , leading it to be measured as being brighter and less sharp .",
    "conversely , a local minimum in the background under a detected star will most likely result in it being measured as being sharper but with a smaller flux . to verify this ,",
    "we have performed tests in which we have replaced all pixel values below a certain threshold with a constant background value , thus reducing the lumpiness of the background .",
    "artificial stars were then added to the frame in the usual way .",
    "the proportion of the artificial stars subject to the effect was found to decrease markedly as this threshold was increased .",
    "since the effect will have influenced all our measurements , the real - star magnitudes were corrected to zero sharpness based on the indicated linear fits to the artificial star data .",
    "the combined color - magnitude diagram from the 4 pc chips ( one from each pointing ) is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : cmcombined ] .",
    "all stars with @xmath13 and @xmath14 are included .",
    "the s / n threshold was deliberately set to be lower here than what would ultimately be used for our star counts because we wanted to ensure that our main sequence fiducial extended to a fainter limiting magnitude .",
    "the adopted main - sequence fiducial is a fifth - order polynomial fit to the median f606w - f814w color in each 0.5-mag f814w band in the range @xmath15 .",
    "a 2.5-@xmath16 clipping routine was used to reject points with outlying colors in each f814w band before each median color was computed .    in order that our artificial star tests might best represent the actual colors and magnitudes of the measured stars",
    ", we selected only those artificial stars whose input magnitudes fell within 0.1 mag in color from the calculated main sequence fiducial .",
    "sample input and output color - magnitude diagrams for the artificial stars in our sample field are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmartificial ] .",
    "since we are interested in determining how the luminosity function of m22 varies as a function of radius from the cluster center , the sets of real and artificial stars for each ccd were divided into concentric annular bins .",
    "these annuli were initially chosen at 60  radial intervals extending from the center of the cluster out to 300  as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : m22area ] .",
    "these 16 ccd fields and 5 radial bins thus give a grid of 80 possible luminosity functions to be calculated . in practice , at most two of these radial bins are well sampled by a given ccd . in order to better sample the core ,",
    "we repeated our analysis using 20  annuli of which only the innermost five contained sufficient numbers of stars for luminosity functions to be computed with any degree of significance .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmclip ] we show the color - magnitude diagram for the sample pointing-3 , wf3 , 60 - 120  bin .",
    "the left panel shows the real star photometry , the right panel is for the artificial stars .",
    "indicated is the main - sequence fiducial ( calculated as described above from the real - star data for all pc fields ) and two 2.5-@xmath16 curves used for statistically correcting the star counts for field - star contamination .",
    "unfortunately the field - star densities of @xcite do not extend to galactic latitudes as near to the plane as m22 ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the selection curves were calculated from the artificial stars as follows .",
    "first , the fiducial main sequence color was subtracted from each point .",
    "the resultant @xmath18(f814w - f606w ) values were then subjected to an iterative 2.5-@xmath16 clipping algorithm , for each 0.5-mag f814w bin and the fiducial main - sequence color added back to the two 2.5-@xmath16 limits .",
    "thus , in the absence of field - star contamination , 98.75% of main - sequence stars are found between the selection curves .",
    "equivalently , the number of stars outside the selection lines should be 1.26% of the number inside . to estimate field star contamination , we count the number of stars inside and outside the selection lines in each 0.5-mag f814w bin within the color range @xmath19 .",
    "if the outside count is greater than 1.26% of the inner count then we adjust the inner count downwards by the excess , weighted for the differing color - ranges covered .",
    "exactly the same algorithm is applied to the artificial - star data and to the real stars .",
    "the application of the 2.5  @xmath16 clipping criterion provides us with an upper limit to the luminosity function in that magnitude bins along the main sequence , although clipped to 5  @xmath16 in color , will also contain background galactic bulge stars .",
    "the bulge color - magnitude diagram @xcite overlaps that of m22 and its luminosity function increases with magnitude .",
    "the luminosity function of the cluster @xmath20 is defined by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the number of stars per unit area with magnitudes between @xmath23 and @xmath24 . in each 0.5-mag f814w bin , @xmath25 ,",
    "is related to the measured star counts , @xmath26 , by the equation @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "the element @xmath28 of the photometric completion matrix , @xmath29 , represents the probability that a star from magnitude bin @xmath30 will be measured in magnitude bin @xmath31 .",
    "this matrix is constructed from the artificial star counts by comparing each measured f814w magnitude with its input magnitude .",
    "for the case of perfect photometry with no `` bin jumping '' , the matrix is diagonal . in practice",
    ", there is a small probability , increasing towards fainter magnitudes , that a given star is scattered up or down in luminosity .",
    "we decided to only measure luminosity functions where the diagonal matrix element was greater than 30% .",
    "experiments showed that constructing the matrix with a limiting magnitude 2 bins below this level was sufficient to assess contamination from fainter stars that have scattered upwards , but not so faint as to cause the matrix to be ill conditioned .",
    "the mean photometric completeness in the lowest bin for all our field / annulus combinations was 0.45 .",
    "one bin above the cutoff , the mean photometric completess was 0.56 . in calculating the luminosity function we took into account poisson errors in the star counts for @xmath32 and also for the artificial star data in the matrix @xmath29 .    a final scale correction to the derived luminosity functions is made to allow for the spatial area sampled and the 0.5-mag f814w bin size .",
    "the individual luminosity functions for the different chip / radius combinations were statistically combined into luminosity functions for each radial bin and the combined luminosity functions from the various fields at different radii from the center of the cluster are given in tables  [ table : lumfcomb60]-[table : lumfcomb20 ] and plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : lumf ] .    also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lumf ] is a luminosity function we have derived for the galactic bulge local to m22 . for this calculation we used the wfpc2 archival dataset u27xjd01 t .",
    "this is a single , non - crsplit , 2400 s f814w exposure of a field offset from the center of m22 by approximately 9 arcmin .",
    "the four wfpc2 ccd frames from this exposure were processed in the same way as the m22 observations .",
    "artificial star tests were again used to correct the derived luminosity functions for photometric completeness and the corrected luminosity functions for the four chips were statistically combined .",
    "the photometric completeness for all chips was around 75% at f814w = 22 and 50% at f814w = 24 .",
    "since the derived bulge luminosity function is approximately linear over @xmath33 we have made a weighted linear fit to the bulge luminosity function in this region , @xmath34 .",
    "comparison with fig .",
    "5 of @xcite shows that the baade s window luminosity function is also linear in this region ( assuming the same distance and extinction ) and has a similar slope .",
    "we have corrected our m22 luminosity functions for background bulge contamination by subtracting the indicated linear fit extrapolated to brighter magnitudes . again referring to fig .",
    "5 of @xcite , the baade s window luminosity function drops more rapidly for magnitudes brighter than @xmath35 ( f814w = 18.5 ) suggesting we may have over - corrected the brighter magnitudes .",
    "however , this over - correction is at most 0.05 in the log luminosity function .",
    "our resulting corrected luminosity functions for m22 are given in tables  [ table : lumfcomb60corr]-[table : lumfcomb20corr ] and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lumfcorr ] .",
    "to transform the luminosity functions into mass functions we use the 10-gyr evolutionary models of @xcite for metal - poor low - mass stars .",
    "these models have been shown to be a good fit to the lower main sequences of globular clusters observed by hst and the authors have made available tables of mass vs luminosity in the wfpc2 flight system filter set . we follow @xcite and calculate [ m / h ] following the prescription of @xcite for halo subdwarfs . for the metallicity range of interest ,",
    "[ m / h ] @xmath36 [ fe / h ] + 0.35 .",

    "[ fig : cmdiso ] we thus compare the main - sequence fiducial of m22 with that predicted by the models for [ m / h ] = @xmath40 and [ m / h ] = @xmath41 .",
    "we have transformed the model points to the observational plane using @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( again from @xcite ) and taken the relative extinction coefficients for the wfpc2 filters from @xcite .",
    "the colors and luminosities for both models provide a remarkable match to our photometric main sequence fiducial .",
    "we adopt the relation for [ m / h ] = @xmath41 as the match is slightly better to both the photometry and the ( presumably more accurate ) caretta & gratton metallicity .",
    "the mass function @xmath44 , defined by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the number of stars per unit area with masses between @xmath47 and @xmath48 , is related to the luminosity function @xmath49 by @xmath50 the mass - luminosity relation from the theoretical [ m / h ] = -1.0 isochrone was thus used to assign a mass range to each f814w bin .",
    "the derivative of the relation at the center of each bin was used to translate the luminosity functions to the mass functions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : massf ] and listed in tables  [ table : mass60]-[table : mass20 ] .",
    "the mass functions for the annular bins can be characterised by examining three regions , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 . for @xmath51 , the mass functions interior to a 180  radius rise towards lower masses with an approximately constant power law index @xmath54 to 1.3 , where @xmath55 .",
    "our data do not extend to faint enough magnitudes to see any turnover in these mass functions . between @xmath56 and @xmath57",
    "the mass functions are flat ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "clear evidence of mass segregation is seen for @xmath57 . outside of approximately @xmath3 ( 60  - 85  ) , the mass function decreases with increasing mass ( @xmath59 ) . within the core and towards the center , there is an increasing tendancy for the mass function to flatten and then rise towards higher masses , as illustrated in the mass functions for 20  annular bins .",
    "having derived the spatially resolved mass function for ngc 6656 , we next address the issue as to whether the degree of mass segregation can be accounted for by the theory of relaxation . to study the dynamical properties of the cluster , we have employed the multi - mass michie  king models originally developed by @xcite and later suitably modified by @xcite and @xcite for the general case of clusters with a set of radially varying luminosity functions .",
    "each model run is characterised by a mass function ( mf ) in the form of an exponential @xmath60 , with a variable exponent @xmath61 ( note that @xmath62 ) , and by four structural parameters describing , respectively , the scale radius ( @xmath63 ) , the scale velocity ( @xmath64 ) , the central value of the dimensionless gravitational potential ( @xmath65 ) and the anisotropy radius ( @xmath66 ) . from the parameter space defined in this way",

    "the fit to the sbp and vdp , however , can only constrain @xmath67 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath68 while still allowing the mf to take on a variety of shapes . to break this degeneracy",
    ", we further impose the condition that the model mf agree with the observed lf .",
    "since michie  king modeling only provides a `` snapshot '' of the current dynamical state of the cluster , one finds it useful to define the global mass function ( gmf ) , the mass distribution of all cluster stars at present , as the mf that the cluster would have simply as a result of stellar evolution ( that is , ignoring any local modifications induced by internal dynamics and/or the interaction with the galactic tidal field ) .",
    "clearly , in this case the imf and gmf of main sequence ( un - evolved ) stars is the same . for practical purposes , the gmf has been divided into sixteen different mass classes , covering main sequence stars , white dwarfs , and heavy remnants , precisely as described in @xcite .",
    "our parametric modelling approach assumes energy equipartition amongst stars of different masses .",
    "thus , we have run a large number of trials to see whether we could find a set of parameters for the gmf ( i.e. a suitable gmf `` shape '' ) such that the local mfs produced by mass segregation would locally fit the observations .",
    "our exercise confirms what we had already implicitly shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : massf ] and described above : as long as a single value of the exponent @xmath61 is used for the gmf over the mass range @xmath69m@xmath70 , none of the predicted mf can be fitted to our data . in fact , a change of slope is needed at @xmath71m@xmath70 so that both the flat and rising portions of the local mf can be reproduced . if we then allow the mf to take on more than one slope , the gmf that best fits the observations is one with @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) for stars in the range @xmath74m@xmath70 and @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) at smaller masses .",
    "although stars more massive than @xmath77m@xmath70 have evolved and are no longer visible , the shape of the imf in this mass range has strong implications as to the fraction of heavy remnants in the cluster and , as such , on the central velocity dispersion .",
    "we find that a value of @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) for stars in the range @xmath80m@xmath70 gives the best fit to the data and to the cluster s structural parameters as given in the literature .",
    "the latter , along with those of our best fitting model , are presented in table  [ table : modelparams ] .",
