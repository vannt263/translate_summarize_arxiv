    "quantum computers are much more powerful than the classical ones @xcite . however , a practical realization of such machines is still a big challenge ahead due to the fragility of the qubits and their decoherence arising from inevitable interactions with the environment . over the years , several error correcting schemes",
    "have been developed @xcite to make the proper working of a quantum computer possible , despite such interactions .",
    "unfortunately , error correcting methods are themselves error prone due to the imperfections of the very gate which are responsible for detecting and correcting errors .",
    "even this can be taken into account by the clever techniques of fault - tolerant quantum computation @xcite .",
    "unfortunately the error threshold below which fault tolerant quantum computation is possible , is very low@xcite . in order to overcome such problems",
    ", one can combine the main quantum feature of the quantum world , namely superposition of states , with the robustness of classical bits which is the result of a macroscopic number of very small entities , comprising each bit .",
    "this has led to the idea of topological quantum computation@xcite , where qubits are formed from degenerate ground states of a topologically ordered many body system .",
    "the important property that these degenerate ground states can not be distinguished by local measurements , protects them agains local errors arising from coupling with the environment , at least as long as temperature is sufficiently low ( see below ) .",
    "+ the prototype of such topological qubits is the toric code first introduced by kitaev @xcite . since then other models have also been developed , notably the color code of bombin and martin - delgado @xcite . in these models , information is stored in the topologically degenerate ground states of the system and the computation is performed by braiding the quasiparticles ( qp ) of the model . here",
    "one can use the gapped ground state and the robust nature of the topological phase of the model to protect information against local errors .",
    "the only perturbations that cause logical error are those with length equal to the system size .",
    "it should be noted that this applies only to zero temperatures , since it has been shown in @xcite and elaborated in @xcite that the proliferation of topological defects is capable of destroying topological order and hence quantum information encoded in such order at any finite temperature .",
    "of course by tuning the parameters of such models @xcite it is possible to increase the time scale for keeping the quantum information if the temperature is kept sufficiently low .",
    "+ in his seminal paper , kitaev showed that universal quantum computation is not possible with an abelian group and in order to perform all universal gates of quantum computation , one needs to either resort to the non - abelian case or use other procedures like magic state distillation @xcite or add some other non - topological resources like measurements to abelian models as in @xcite . aside from the ability of abelian models to perform universal quantum computation in the above sense , their robustness and stability against external perturbations is still a crucial question which has to be investigated .",
    "plenty of recent studies have been devoted for investigating such questions @xcite . the motivation for such studies are not entirely based on quantum computation .",
    "in fact since topological order adds an entirely new paradigm for studying phase transition in condensed matter compared with the traditional one of symmetry breaking , it is very instructive to study various facets of this new phenomena .",
    "for example how topological order is destroyed under thermal fluctuation @xcite , how it gives way to local order in the presence of an external field like magnetic field @xcite are just two such broad questions .",
    "of particular interest to us is the question of how topological order gives way to local order in the absence of external field when a local ordering interaction is added .",
    "this question was first investigated in our previous work @xcite , where we studied the competition of topological order and ferromagnetic order in a model which we called kitaev - ising model .",
    "there it was shown that there is a critical coupling of ising where topological order is replaced with ferromagnetic order .",
    "in that model we used a mean - field analysis and a simple calculation of wilson - loop operators to find the transition point . + in the context of condensed matter physics , it is important to understand the role of local degrees of freedom and their symmetry in topological order and its properties",
    ". it is mainly for such reasons , aside from the appeal of d - level states or qudits for quantum computation , that investigation of the above questions for general topological models for @xmath2 level states is important .",
    "for example it is very desirable to understand the competition of @xmath3 topological order and @xmath3 local ferromagnetic order .",
    "the latter is a phase possessed by the @xmath2 level potts model where the @xmath3 symmetry is broken .",
    "the potts model is a direct generalization of ising model and has been extensively studied since its inception @xcite .",
    "while it is very desirable to perform such a study for general values of @xmath4 , the analysis turns out to be very difficult .",
    "the @xmath5state potts model is an exception in the sense that the hamiltonian is much simpler , because it has an equidistant spectrum which brings much simplification in our analysis .",
    "it is therefore natural that @xmath0 potts model has been studied more intensively in the series of @xmath2 level potts model , both in the classical context and in the new context in relation to topological order . +",
    "it has been shown that the @xmath1 kitaev model is more robust against temperature than the @xmath6 one@xcite .",
    "the robustness of the model has also been studied in transverse magnetic field @xcite and it has been shown that the topological order transforms to the magnetic order via a first order phase transition . here",
    "we want to extend these studies by studying the competition of @xmath0 topological order induced by the @xmath0 kitaev model and the local order induced by the 3-state potts model .",
    "we will see that the equidistant spectrum of the model leads to much technical simplification in the method we use , namely perturbative continuous unitary transformations ( pcut)@xcite .",
    "we will show that like the kitaev - ising model @xcite , the kitaev - potts model also shows a first - order phase transition and the topological order break downs at a critical coupling of potts .",
    "in contrast to the kitaev - ising model , here our study is more comprehensive in that we use three different methods for locating the transition point , namely we capture the phase transition by analysis of the ground state energy , one - quasiparticle gap and geometric measure of entanglement .",
    "the location of the transition turns out to be slightly different by these methods , and we provide arguments to show that with better approximations of these methods , this slight change will be removed . + the outline of the paper is as follows : in sec .",
