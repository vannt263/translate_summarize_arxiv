    "optimal control theory is concerned with the analysis of controlled dynamical systems , where one aims at steering such a system from a given configuration to some desired target by minimizing some criterion .",
    "the pontryagin maximum principle ( in short , pmp ) , established at the end of the 50 s for general nonlinear continuous - time dynamics ( see @xcite , and see @xcite for the history of this discovery ) , is certainly the milestone of the classical optimal control theory .",
    "it provides a first - order necessary condition for optimality , by asserting that any optimal trajectory must be the projection of an extremal .",
    "the pmp reduces the search of optimal trajectories to a boundary value problem over the set of extremals . optimal control theory , and in particular the pmp , has an immense field of applications in various domains ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    the classical version of the pmp that can be found in @xcite",
    "is concerned with optimal _ permanent control _ problems , that is , when the control can be modified at any instant of time . in many problems , achieving the optimal trajectory requires a permanent modification of the control .",
    "however , such a requirement is not conceivable in practice for human beings , even for mechanical or numerical devices .",
    "therefore , _ sampled - data controls _ or _ digital controls _ , for which only a finite number of modifications is allowed , are usually considered for engineering issues .",
    "the fixed switching times at which ( and only at which ) the sampled - data controls can be modified are usually called _ controlling times _ or _ sampling times_. in _ optimal sampled - data control problems _ , the control evolves in discrete time and the state evolves in continuous time .",
    "the situation differs from what is usually called _ discrete - time optimal control problem _",
    ", where both the state and the control evolve in discrete time .",
    "some versions of the pmp for discrete - time optimal control problems can be found in the literature ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    since the 60 s , an extensive literature deals with sampled - data ( or digital ) control systems , as evidenced by numerous references and books ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) , and it is still an active research topic",
    ". a significant part of the literature is concerned with @xmath0-@xmath1 optimization theory ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , but many numerical and theoretical treatments of other optimization criteria are also addressed ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we establish some new related results with , to the best of our knowledge , a novel approach based on a recently established version of the pmp that can be applied to optimal sampled - data control problems .",
    "we refer to @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) for this pmp .",
    "our main results in this paper , theorems  [ thmmainresult ] and  [ thmmainresult2 ] , are based on the application of this pmp to the particular framework of linear - quadratic optimal control problems ( in short , lqocps ) .",
    "lqocps are widely studied in the literature ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and used in practice . indeed , considering a quadratic cost functional is very usual and natural , for instance in order to minimize distances to nominal trajectories in tracking problems and , even if dynamical systems are nonlinear in general , linearized systems are frequently considered , for instance for stabilization issues .",
    "the application of the pmp of @xcite to a lqocp with sampled - data controls yields an optimal sampled - data control expressed as a function of the costate , thus , as an _ open - loop control _ ( see proposition  [ proppmpsample ] in section  [ section2 ] ) .",
    "then , two questions naturally arise .",
    "1 .   the first question concerns the ( pointwise ) convergence of optimal sampled - data controls to the optimal permanent control as the distances between consecutive sampling times tend to zero .",
    "we give in theorem  [ thmmainresult ] ( section  [ section2 ] ) a positive answer to this question . at this stage ,",
    "optimal sampled - data controls are still expressed as open - loop controls .",
    "the second issue concerns the expression of optimal sampled - data controls as _",
    "feedbacks _ , _ i.e. _ , as _ closed - loop controls_. we provide in theorem  [ thmmainresult2 ] ( section  [ section3 ] ) such an expression .",
    "two different proofs of theorem  [ thmmainresult2 ] are given , based respectively on the pmp of @xcite ( see section  [ secfirstproof ] ) and on an adequate version of the dynamic programming principle ( see section  [ secsecondproof ] ) : 1 .   for continuous lqocps with permanent controls , it is well known how to pass from the open - loop optimal ( permanent ) control coming from the classical pmp to a closed - loop form expressed in terms of the riccati matrix , at the price of solving the so - called riccati matrix differential equation ( see @xcite ) . in section  [ secfirstproof ]",
    "the proof of theorem  [ thmmainresult2 ] is derived from the open - loop form ( proposition  [ proppmpsample ] ) resulting from the pmp of  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that optimal controls of discrete lqocps can be expressed as closed - loop controls using the dynamic programming principle ( see @xcite ) , and moreover can be explicitly computed in a recursive way , requiring in particular to solve an explicit discrete riccati matrix differences equation . considering state - transition matrices ,",
    "a general ( continuous ) lqocp with sampled - data controls can be written as a discrete lqocp ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this is the point of view adopted in  @xcite where the authors solve explicitly lqocps with sampled - data controls , in a recursive way , for autonomous and homogeneous problems .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ thmmainresult2 ] that we give in section  [ secsecondproof ] actually provides an extension of the strategy proposed in  @xcite to the nonautonomous and nonhomogeneous case .",
    "our method is based on the dynamic programming principle but it is not required to write the lqocp with sampled - data controls as a discrete lqocp .",
    "+ these two different approaches lead , in accordance , to theorem  [ thmmainresult2 ] , and thus complete the riccati theory for lqocps with sampled - data controls .",
    "moreover , as in @xcite , it can be derived from theorem  [ thmmainresult2 ] a recursive way to compute explicitly the optimal sampled - data controls of lqocps ( see corollary  [ corollary ] in section  [ section3 ] ) .    in turn , combining theorem  [ thmmainresult ] and corollary  [ thmmainresult ] , we provide in this paper a strategy in order to compute explicitly pointwise convergent approximations of optimal permanent controls of lqocps .",
