    "special relativity has so long fit all experimental data , so it has been considered ascertained . here , the operability of special relativity is therefore scrutinized .",
    "special relativity takes the proper system as a sovereign referential frame , to which all inertial systems are referred to , thus allowing it to deal exclusively with speeds relative to the observer and to disregard the fact that himself is actuality inertial .",
    "hence , let us scrutinize the support and workability of its approach [ 1 - 10 ] .",
    "it suffices to analyze why the actual motion of inertial observers can be allegedly disregarded , and up to what extent this applies . +   + nowadays more experimental information is available than that einstein had , and it is now known that our galaxy has a drift speed of about 600 km / s relative to the cmb [ 11 - 13 ] , and that due to the galaxy rotation the earth has a net speed of only about 370 km / s , which is relatively low compared to the speed of light .",
    "so , its speed is far away from that required for relativistic effects acting on it to be significant .",
    "but , even though its speed would be substantially higher special relativity would still work out .",
    "the motive is that , as long as the speed of the inertial observer through the cmb stands in the portion of the @xmath0 curve in which it is almost linear , no significant quantitative departure from special relativity will come out . in that range of speed",
    "all inertial systems can be regarded equivalent . however , for an observer that would move at a relativistic speed through the cmb , and thus situated in the non linear range of the @xmath0 curve , its own speed could not be neglected anymore , and special relativity would appear conceptually defective .",
    "let us now demonstrate it .",
    "+   + it should be differentiated between classical observers , i.e. those with a proper speed in the linear lower range of the @xmath0 curve and relativistic observers , i.e. those with a speed in the non linear part of the @xmath0 curve .",
    "the standard @xmath0 factor applies for classical observers as an acceptable approximation , but does not for relativistic observers in which case an amended full form of the @xmath0 factor should be used .",
    "@xmath1    versus    @xmath2    the issue stands on which of these two formulations of the @xmath0 factor is the accurate one .",
    "the first formulation of @xmath0 takes into account the fact that the observer is himself inertial , while the second formulation disregards it .",
    "let us note that if the observer speed @xmath3 is ignored the two formulations become identical .",
    "so , the standard expression of @xmath0 can be regarded as being an approximation applying when the observer motion is null or low , such as for any observer on earth .",
    "let us now derive the amended formulation of @xmath0 and the related proper time of inertial systems .",
    "+   + special relativity foresees speed induced dilation of time , one of its upshots . yet",
    ", one of its odd corollaries has been depicted in the langevin or twin paradox [ 14 - 16 ] .",
    "the outcome of time dilation is here addressed not just from the standard mathematical handling but also from a physical approach concerned with causality .",
    "the point is that , since the proper time and time dilation are uncovered by means of clocks , let us center on their aptness to be sensitive to speed .",
    "special relativity uses the observer proper time , and from it , defines the proper time of any inertial system with a relative speed @xmath4 , according to the relation : +   + ( 1 ) @xmath5 @xmath6 =    @xmath7    and reciprocally : ( 2 ) @xmath6 =    @xmath8    = @xmath9 @xmath10 +   + where @xmath6 is the observer proper time and @xmath0 the lorentz factor .",
    "the time @xmath9 so defined is thus the proper time of the observed inertial system .",
    "so , each inertial system has its own proper time and all them are correlated through their respective relative speed . in special relativity",
    "the observer takes himself as a sovereign reference , and defines the proper time of all inertial systems in base of his own , and through the exclusive reliance on the relative speed .",
    "so , a crucial question comes out , i.e. what fixes in first instance the observer proper time ?",
    "special relativity regards the proper time as a standard , disregarding any underlying dependence on the observer own motion through his spatial environment .",
    "+   + obviously , the proper time of any inertial system can not be causally ruled by the speed relative to any observer .",
    "so , any relation with the speed relative to an arbitrary observer has a relational value but certainly can not have any causal assessment .",
    "the proper time of any inertial system must be ruled by some universal tenet , common to all of them .",
    "it surely can not depend on any arbitrary referential observer that is himself inertial .",
    "their proper time must be fixed by their speed relative to some universal extended entity , which in fact can not be anything else but their own environment , i.e. space itself .",
    "+   + so , to reach understanding , from a causal viewpoint , the issue fixing the proper time of any inertial system , a universal reference is needed . from 1964 , due to the fortuitous discovery by arno penzias and robert wilson [ 12 ] of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , an extended reference is at hand . in effect , in view of its high isotropy [ 10 - 12 ] it constitutes a much valuable extended electromagnetic medium , furthermore of universal range .",
    "moreover , the cmb being an electromagnetic field with an isotropic distribution implies that all photons embodying it go in all directions at the speed c within free space .",
    "logically , this infers that the cmb can not have any drift velocity through space .",
    "consequently , the cmb or space itself can be referred equivalently in order to normalize speeds .",
    "+   + thus , let us define the proper time of any inertial system relative to the cmb , being so normalized to a reference common to all of them .",
    "the proper time @xmath6 of an observer on earth expressed in relation with its speed @xmath3 relative to the motionless cmb , is : +   + ( 3 ) @xmath6 =    @xmath11     +   + reciprocally , let us take our proper time @xmath6 on earth as referential time , and from the speed @xmath3 in reference to the cmb let us deduce the proper time @xmath12 of a system at rest relative to it , i.e. at a lower speed of 370 km / s than that of the earth : +   + ( 4 ) @xmath13 +   + from now on we will refer all proper times with respect to @xmath12 , allowing thus to normalize all them to a single and universal pattern of time measurement .",
    "so , the proper time @xmath9 of an inertial system with speed @xmath14 relative to the cmb is : +   + ( 5 ) @xmath15    @xmath16     +   + solving equations ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) gives : +   + ( 6 ) @xmath17    @xmath18     +   + but since @xmath19 , ( @xmath4 being the relative speed ) we get : +   + ( 7 ) @xmath17    @xmath20    while the sr formula gives : ( 8) @xmath21    @xmath22     +   + it merges out that the formulation of @xmath0 from special relativity is short of the term in the numerator and of the speed @xmath3 in the denominator , where @xmath3 refers to the actual speed of the proper inertial system through the cmb .",
    "it is easily seen that for low speed observers the two above formulations ( 7 ) and ( 8) tend to equality , and so @xmath3 can be neglected .",
    "however , this term becomes crucial and can not be omitted anymore when the proper speed through",
    "the cmb , or equivalently through space , is high .",
    "so , it comes into sight that the formulation from special relativity is an approximation that can be used only when the speed of the proper inertial system through the cmb is low , such as it is the case for the earth ( fig.1 ) .",
    "+   +     factor may have different values ( width of the horizontal strips ) , according to the position of the relative speed along the @xmath0 curve , i.e. according to the proper speed of the observer .",
    "special relativity ignores this fact , giving always the same value of the @xmath0 factor for the same relative speed .",
    "the different widths of @xmath0 fixe the different proper - times of different observed inertial systems with the same speed relative to the observer .",
    "let us emphasize the need of taking into account the observer speed and its position along the @xmath0 curve .",
    "special relativity ignores in what range of the lorentz @xmath0 factor is situated the relative speed , which position depends on the observer proper speed relative to the cmb .",
    "this derives from overlooking the fact that the proper system is inertial , oversight which is a conceptual shortcut . in practice",
    ", it is not noticed due to the fact that the speed of earth through space is low ( 370 km / s ) , so it can be ignored and earth can be considered at rest .",
    "this allows all experiments made on it to be regarded as exclusively dependant on relative speeds from it .",
    "+   +     factors according to the observer own speed . at low speed of the observer",
    "there is no significant difference between the two formulations of the @xmath0 factor , but at high speed they depart considerably . _ ]     +   + however , a flaw would appear if the proper system would acquire a high speed through space . in that case",
    "its speed just could not be ignored , and the reduction to relative speeds would appear faulty , as already pointed out above .",
    "special relativity stands safe thanks to the required high speed of the proper inertial system to evidence that it is conceptually defective is inaccessible . the reduction to",
    "relative speed works out for low speed observers only because in that range the lorentz @xmath0 factor is almost flat , so the influence of the proper speed is insignificant .",
    "however , if its speed would be high , above @xmath23 km / s , then it would be in the range of the @xmath0 curve where it is no more almost linear , and hence the speed of the proper observer could no longer be neglected and the reduction to just relative speeds would fall short ( fig.2 ) .",
    "let us evaluate three different cases with the same relative speed between observer and observed inertial object , e.g. of 30000 km / s , but with a different speed through space of the observer .",
    "this concept is unattended in special relativity , which only relies on the relative speed and thus it predicts the same value of the @xmath0 factor for the three cases .",
    "it is clear that for @xmath3 = 0 , equation ( 7 ) reduces to that of special relativity ( 8) .",
    "so , the proper time @xmath9 of the observed object with a relative speed @xmath4 = 30000 km / s is in both formulations equal to : +   + ( 8) @xmath17    @xmath24    = @xmath6    @xmath25    = 1.00504 @xmath6 +   + where @xmath6 is the observer proper time . +   +",
    "it is therefore evidenced that when the observer speed is low it can be neglected and then @xmath9 is equal to that from special relativity .",
    "this makes evident why special relativity works out .",
    "so , special relativity is inadvertently assuming that the observer is at absolute rest .",
    "for a proper speed @xmath3 = 370 km / s and the same relative speed @xmath4 = 30000 km / s as before : +   + ( 9 ) @xmath17    @xmath26    = 1.00516 @xmath6 and @xmath21    @xmath25    = 1.00504 @xmath6 +   + ( 10 ) @xmath27 = 1.00516 @xmath6 - 1.00504 @xmath6 = 0.00012 @xmath6 +   + it comes thus into view that when the proper motion is not disregarded the calculated time @xmath9 differs from that of special relativity , which appears as an approximation valid only for low speed observers , such as it is the case on earth .      for a proper speed @xmath3 = 269.990 km / s and the same relative speed @xmath4 = 30000",
    "km / s as before : +   + ( 11 ) @xmath17    @xmath26    = 75.5046 @xmath6 and @xmath17    @xmath25    = 1.00504 @xmath6 +   + ( 12 ) @xmath27 = 75.5046 @xmath6 - 1.00504 @xmath6 = 74.4995 @xmath6 +   + then , it appears clear that for a fast moving observer the time @xmath9 calculated from special relativity , which ignores the observer proper speed , would be substantially shorter .",
    "since unfortunately we are unable to make the proper inertial system reaching very high speeds nor decelerating it down to a null absolute speed , let us consider another case , which is much less optimal that the previous pedagogic ones but that could be feasible . +   + for a relative speed @xmath4 of 15 km / s , special relativity predicts a time - dilation equal to : +   + ( 13 ) @xmath21    @xmath25    = 1.00000000125 @xmath6 +   + while the full expression of @xmath0 predicts a slightly different time - dilation : +   + ( 14 ) @xmath17    @xmath26    = 1.0000000629 @xmath6 +   + ( 15 ) @xmath27 = 6.167 @xmath28 @xmath6 +   + indeed a very small discrepancy , quite difficult to measure .",
    "if @xmath6 is taken equal to 1 second then @xmath9 expresses its dilation , and @xmath27 would then express the departure between the two predicted dilations of one second , i.e. 6.167 @xmath28 s. supposing a one year long roundtrip the discrepancy between the two predicted time dilations would be : +   + ( 16 ) @xmath29(3600 24 365 ) = 1.95 s +   + this clearly highlights why special relativity stands safe in spite of being conceptually defective .",
    "it would be very difficult to feasibly measure such a small discrepancy knowing that time dilation would also be affected by residual microgravity and eventually by tiny temperature fluctuation .",
    "however , this does not justify not being concerned by the conceptual shortcomings of special relativity .",
    "due to the rotation of the earth around the sun the net speed of earth varies along the year , according to the change of the orientation of the speed @xmath4 relative to its drift speed @xmath3 through the cmb , the maximum and minimum speed reached being at the most : @xmath30 km / s .",
    "taking as unit of time @xmath6 = 1 s when @xmath4 is orthogonal to @xmath3 , the half - yearly maximum and minimum dilation of one second would be : +   + ( 17 ) @xmath17    @xmath31    = 1.0000001283 s +   + ( 18 ) @xmath17    @xmath32    = 0.9999998817 s +   + ( 19 ) @xmath27 = 1.0000001283 - 0.9999998817 = 2.4667 @xmath33 s @xmath34 0.25 @xmath35 +   + so , time does not flow evenly all along the year .",
    "however , the net effect is almost null , since its increase during a semester is almost totally compensated by its decrease during the next semester , with a residual yearly shift of the order of @xmath33 s. in the same way that we are not perceptive of our own speed , the yearly fluctuation of time can not be detected on earth , but an observer at absolute rest could uncover it .",
    "to further illustrate , by way of the well known twin paradox , the departure from special relativity , which deals with a single value of the @xmath0 factor for a given relative speed , let us calculate the aging difference for e.g. a one year journey , for the three first cases considered in section ( 4 ) , i.e. with different speeds of the observer but the same relative speed in all cases .      according to special relativity ,",
    "the aging difference between the two twins is exclusively fixed by the aircraft speed relative to the earth .",
    "the earth is taken as a sovereign reference and its actual motion is ignored .",
    "so , e.g. for a one year journey at a relative speed of 30000 km / s , special relativity predicts that the time - dilation difference between the twins would be : +   + ( 20 ) @xmath21    @xmath25    - @xmath6 = ( 1.00504 - 1 ) @xmath6 = 0.005038 @xmath6 +   + let us now foresee the twins aging difference according to the three cases in which the relative speed between twins is maintained fix but the speed of the referential twin is varying .      if the normalized speed @xmath3 , i.e. that relative to the cmb is null , then : +   + ( 21 ) @xmath17    @xmath26    - @xmath36    @xmath25    - @xmath6 +   + for a relative speed @xmath3 between twins of 30000 km / s , the time - dilation difference between them is identical from both formulations and equal to : +   + ( 22 ) @xmath9 = ( 1.005038 - 1 ) @xmath6 = 0.005038 @xmath6 +   + so , in this case the two formulations are equivalent and thus the prediction from special relativity can be seen as an approximation in which the speed of the referential system is ignored and thus taken for null .      since from the normalized reference ( cmb ) the observer proper speed",
    "is accounted for , the predicted time - dilation difference between the twins is : +   + ( 23 ) @xmath17    @xmath26    - @xmath6 = 1.005163 - 1 = 0.005163 @xmath6 +   + where @xmath3 is the speed relative to the cmb and @xmath6 the proper - time on earth .",
    "+   + for @xmath3 = 370 km / s and @xmath4 = 30000 km / s , the discrepancy with the time - dilation predicted by special relativity ( equ.22 ) , which foresees a single issue for a given relative speed , ignoring the motion of the referential inertial system , is thus : +   + ( 24 ) @xmath27 = 0.005163 @xmath6 - 0.005038 @xmath6 = 0.000125 @xmath6 +   + for a journey of one year , the discrepancy between the two predicted aging of the traveling twin would be : +   + ( 25 ) @xmath27 = 0.000125 @xmath6 = 0.000125 ( 60 24 365 ) = 65.7 min      \\(26 ) @xmath17    @xmath31    - @xmath6 = 74.5046 @xmath6 +   + so , the difference between equ.(26 ) and equ.(22 ) is : +   + ( 27 ) @xmath27 = 74.5046 @xmath6 - 0.005038 @xmath6 = 74.4995 @xmath6 +   + where @xmath6 is the proper time of the reference twin traveling at a speed @xmath3 = 269990 km / s in reference to the cmb .",
    "+   + for one year journey of the twin traveling at the speed @xmath3 , from equ.(27 ) the discrepancy between the two predicted time - dilations is : +   + ( 28 ) @xmath27 = 74.4995 @xmath6 = 74.4995 years      from a physical stance , the flow of time is indicated by the beating of clocks , whose oscillatory frequency is affected by speed , slowing down at increased speed .",
    "naturally , this applies to any kind of oscillators , and thus to the oscillatory frequency of atoms , molecules and organic molecules .",
    "the time - dilation should not be treated independently of oscillators and approached in an abstract way , disjoint from its actual contextual origin .",
    "it should always be kept in mind that the actual cause of the speed - induced time - dilation is the slowing down of the frequency of clocks , and more generally of any type of oscillator .",
    "+   + so , the physical approach to the effects of speed predicts that all molecules from any organic body will decrease their oscillation frequency with increased speed .",
    "this has a crucial consequence .",
    "the slowing down of the oscillatory frequency of biological molecules can affect adversely the metabolic activity , endangering the upholding of life .",
    "so , actually the twin travelling at a relativistic speed may fall sick due to the slowing down of its metabolism or even die , without understanding why due to a counterfeit epicentral viewpoint , which by taking himself as reference , makes him illusively think that the other bodies are moving relative to him .",
    "this is a quite different issue than that predicted by the theory of relativity , which foresees a happy end for the travelling twin , returning younger than his brother instead of sick or even dead .",
    "+   + it has thus been pointed out that the observer proper speed and the position of the relative speed along the @xmath0 curve can not be disregarded for high speeds . moreover ,",
    "each twin ages according to his own absolute speed , and their speed difference defines their aging variance .",
    "so , there is no ambiguous shortcoming needing to be dissipated , as in special relativity , about who ages slower due to the symmetry between the twins relative speed , arising from the velocity reciprocity principle that stipulates : `` if the velocity of an inertial frame s relative to another such frame s is v , then the velocity of s relative to s is -v '' . in the amended @xmath0 framework",
    "there is no symmetry between twins , all speeds being expressed with respect to a single reference .",
    "so , the twin who has aged less is unequivocally the one who has traveled at the higher absolute speed , or that is to say , at higher speed in reference to the cmb .",
    "let us highlight that equivalence between the proposed formulation of the @xmath0 factor and the corresponding one from special relativity is fulfilled only when the observer is at absolute rest . when it does not their quantitative predictions differ .",
    "this points out that special relativity is inadvertently assuming that the observer is at absolute rest , despite it repudiates this concept .",
    "since the earth speed through space is quite low , the departure of the standard @xmath0 factor from its amended homologue is so small that it stays short of quantitative significance . yet , on conceptual grounds the difference is essential , since it establishes that the laws of physics are determined by the absolute speed of the inertial systems .",
    "the curtailed reliance on relative speeds is applicable only for slow moving observers . on practice",
    "this will not affect the use of special relativity because we live on a slow moving habitat .",
    "+   + a genuine shortcoming comes from treating time just mathematically as if it were a sovereign entity disjointed from clocks .",
    "the dependence of time on speed derives from the reliance on speed of the beating of clocks .",
    "it also merges out that the speed - induced dilation of time can not be thought as just applying on aging , without considering its full physical foundation . in effect",
    ", the flow of time is evidenced through the beating of clocks , which oscillatory frequency is affected by speed , slowing down as it increases . since this applies to any kind of oscillators and thus to the oscillatory frequency of atoms , molecules and organic molecules as well , this would affect the metabolism of any space traveler .",
    "+   + it has been evidenced that the @xmath0 factor used by special relativity is a truncated formulation having the value of an approximation , suitable only for slow moving inertial observers .",
    "the reduction to relative speed works out for low speed proper systems such as the earth only because in that range the lorentz @xmath0 factor is almost flat , so the influence of the proper speed is insignificant .",
    "however , on an aircraft with a speed above @xmath23 km / s , it would then be in the @xmath0 factor range where its slope starts varying significantly and the omission of its own speed would not stand anymore .",
    "it urges recovering pragmatic foundations taking into account the decisive fact that the proper system is actually moving within space and that its speed can not be neglected when it is high .",
    "the fact that physical laws come out to be identical , as an acceptable approximation for slow inertial observers , does not uphold setting a conceptual framework ignoring their actual motion through space .",
    "+   + it would be wishful that an agency with cutting - edge technological means would check the fundamental issue of the influence of the observer proper kinetics , issue discarded in the foundation of special relativity .",
