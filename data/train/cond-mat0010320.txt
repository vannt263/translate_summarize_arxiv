    "liquid crystalline materials are often made up of long , thin , rod - like molecules@xcite .",
    "the molecular geometry and interactions can lead to a wide range of equilibrium phases . here",
    "we shall be concerned with two of the simplest , the isotropic phase , where the orientation of the molecules is random , and the nematic phase , where the molecules tend to align along a preferred direction .",
    "the aim of this paper is to describe a numerical scheme which can explore the hydrodynamics of liquid crystals within both the isotropic and the nematic phases .",
    "there are two major differences between the hydrodynamics of simple liquids and that of liquid crystals .",
    "first , the geometry of the molecules means that they are rotated by gradients in the velocity field .",
    "second , the equilibrium free energy is more complex than for a simple fluid and this in turn increases the complexity of the stress tensor in the navier - stokes equation for the evolution of the fluid momentum .",
    "this coupling between the elastic energy and the flow leads to rich hydrodynamic behaviour .",
    "a simple example is the existence of a tumbling phase where the molecules rotate in an applied shear@xcite .",
    "other examples include shear banding , a non - equilibrium phase separation into coexisting states with different strain rates@xcite , and the possibility of williams domains , convection cells induced by an applied electric field@xcite .",
    "the equations of motion describing liquid crystal hydrodynamics are complex .",
    "there are several derivations broadly in agreement , but differing in the detailed form of some terms . here",
    "we follow the approach of beris and edwards@xcite who write the equations of motion in terms of a tensor order parameter @xmath0 which can be related to the second moment of the orientational distribution function of the molecules .",
    "this has the advantage that the hydrodynamics of both the isotropic and the nematic phases , and of topological defects in the nematic phase , can be included within the same formalism .",
    "most other theories of liquid crystal hydrodynamics appear as limiting cases .",
    "in particular the ericksen - leslie formulation of nematodynamics@xcite , widely used in the experimental liquid crystal literature , follows when uniaxiality is imposed and the magnitude of the order parameter is held constant .",
    "considerable analytic progress in understanding liquid crystal flow in simple geometries has been made , but this is inevitably limited by the complexity of the equations of motion . therefore it is useful to formulate a method of obtaining numerical solutions of the hydrodynamic equations to further explore their rich phenomenology .",
    "moreover we should like to be able to predict flow patterns for given viscous and elastic coefficients for comparison to experiments and to explore the effects of hydrodynamics when liquid crystals are used in display devices or during industrial processing .",
    "rey and tsuji@xcite have obtained interesting results on flow - induced ordering of the director field and on defect dynamics by solving the beris - edwards equation for the order parameter .",
    "however , the velocity field was imposed externally and no back - flows ( effect of the director configuration on the velocity field ) were included .",
    "fukuda@xcite used an euler scheme to solve a model somewhat simpler than the full beris - edwards model but still including backflow , and studied the effect of hydrodynamics on phase ordering in liquid crystals .",
    "otherwise most previous work on liquid crystal hydrodynamics has been limited to a constant order parameter ( the ericksen - leslie - parodi equations ) and often restricted to one dimension .",
    "lattice boltzmann schemes have recently proved very successful in simulations of complex fluids and it is this approach that we shall take here@xcite .",
    "such algorithms can be usefully and variously considered as a slightly unusual finite - difference discretization of the equations of motion or as a lattice version of a simplified boltzmann equation .",
    "it is not understood why the approach is particularly useful for complex fluids but it may be related to the very natural way in which a free energy describing the equilibrium properties of the fluid can be incorporated in the simulations , drawing on ideas from statistical mechanics@xcite .",
    "recent applications have included phase ordering and flow in binary fluids@xcite and self - assembly and spontaneous emulsification in amphiphilic fluids@xcite .",
    "however , in applications so far , with the exception of @xcite , the order parameter has been a scalar and has coupled to the flow via a simple advective term .",
    "the liquid crystal equations of motion are written in terms of a tensor order parameter .",
    "this is responsible for the main new features of the lattice boltzmann approach described in this paper .",
    "it also leads to the possibility of exploring viscoelastic fluid behaviour such as shear - thinning and shear - banding without the need to impose a constitutive equation for the stress@xcite .    in section 2",
    "we summarise the hydrodynamic equations of motion for liquid crystals .",
    "the lattice boltzmann scheme is defined in section 3 .",
    "a modified version of the collision operator is used to eliminate lattice viscosity effects . section 4 describes a chapman - enskog expansion which relates the numerical scheme to the hydrodynamic equations of motion .",
    "numerical results for simple shear flows are presented in section 5 and other possible applications of the approach are outlined in section 6 .",
    "we shall follow the formulation of liquid crystal hydrodynamics described by beris and edwards@xcite .",
    "the continuum equations of motion are written in terms of a tensor order parameter @xmath0 which is related to the direction of individual molecules @xmath1 by @xmath2 where the angular brackets denote a coarse - grained average .",
    "( greek indices will be used to represent cartesian components of vectors and tensors and the usual summation over repeated indices will be assumed . )",
    "@xmath0 is a traceless symmetric tensor which is zero in the isotropic phase .",
    "we first write down a landau free energy which describes the equilibrium properties of the liquid crystal and the isotropic  nematic transition .",
    "this appears in the equation of motion of the order parameter , which includes a cahn - hilliard - like term through which the system evolves towards thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "it also includes a term coupling the order parameter to the flow .",
    "the order parameter is both advected by the flow and , because liquid crystal molecules are rod - like , rotated by velocity gradients .",
    "we then write down the continuity and navier - stokes equations for the evolution of the flow field .",
    "in particular the form of the stress appropriate to a tensor order parameter is discussed .",
    "a brief comparison is given to a similar formalism introduced by doi@xcite and extended by olmsted _ et .",
    "al._@xcite . for a uniaxial nematic in the absence of any defects",
    "the beris - edwards equations reduce to the ericksen - leslie - parodi formulation of nematodynamics@xcite .",
    "the hydrodynamic behaviour of nematic liquid crystals is often characterised in terms of the leslie coefficients and it is therefore useful to list them below .",
    "more details of the mapping between the beris - edwards and the ericksen - leslie - parodi equations are given in appendix a. + * free energy : * the equilibrium properties of a liquid crystal in solution can be described by a free energy@xcite @xmath3 we shall work within the one elastic constant approximation .",
    "although it is not hard to include more general elastic terms this simplification will not affect the qualitative behaviour .",
    "the free energy ( [ free ] ) describes a first order transition from the isotropic to the nematic phase . + * equation of motion of the nematic order parameter : * the equation of motion for the nematic order parameter is@xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a collective rotational diffusion constant . the first term on the left - hand side of equation ( [ qevolution ] ) is the material derivative describing the usual time dependence of a quantity advected by a fluid with velocity @xmath6",
    "this is generalised by a second term @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the symmetric part and the anti - symmetric part respectively of the velocity gradient tensor @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 appears in the equation of motion because the order parameter distribution can be both rotated and stretched by flow gradients .",
    "@xmath12 is a constant which will depend on the molecular details of a given liquid crystal .",
    "the term on the right - hand side of equation ( [ qevolution ] ) describes the relaxation of the order parameter towards the minimum of the free energy .",
    "the molecular field @xmath13 which provides the driving motion is related to the derivative of the free energy by @xmath14 + * continuity and navier - stokes equations : * the fluid momentum obeys the continuity @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the fluid density , and the navier - stokes equation @xmath17 the form of the equation is not dissimilar to that for a simple fluid .",
    "however the details of the stress tensor reflect the additional complications of liquid crystal hydrodynamics .",
    "there is a symmetric contribution @xmath18 and an antisymmetric contribution @xmath19 the pressure @xmath20 is taken to be @xmath21    an earlier development of liquid crystal hydrodynamics in terms of a tensor order parameter was proposed by doi@xcite .",
    "the doi theory is based upon a smoluchowski evolution equation ( similar to the boltzmann equation for translational motion ) for the orientational distribution function .",
    "the main advantage of the approach is the possibility of relating the phenomenological coefficients in the equations of motion to microscopic parameters .",
    "one omission is the lack of gradient terms in the free energy ( but see @xcite ) .",
    "moreover it is necessary to use closure approximations to obtain a tractable set of hydrodynamic equations .",
    "the doi and beris  edwards equations are very similar : the main difference is in the symmetric contribution to the stress tensor .",
    "the doi theory gives a simpler form which is incomplete in that it does not obey onsager reciprocity .",
    "( a similar comment applies to all closure relations that we have found in the literature .",
    ")    hydrodynamic equations for the nematic phase were formulated by ericksen and leslie@xcite .",
    "these are widely used as the leslie coefficients provide a useful measure of the viscous properties of the liquid crystal fluid .",
    "the beris - edwards equations reduce to those of ericksen and leslie in the uniaxial nematic phase when the magnitude of the order parameter remains constant .",
    "hence a limitation of the ericksen - leslie theory is that it can not include the hydrodynamics of topological defects . for convenience",
    "we list below the relationship between the leslie coefficients and the parameters appearing in the equations of motion ( [ qevolution ] ) and ( [ ns ] ) . an outline of their derivation from the beris ",
    "edwards approach is given in appendix a. @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the magnitude of the nematic order parameter and @xmath24 .",
    "a detailed comparison of the theories of liquid crystal hydrodynamics can be found in beris and edwards@xcite .",
    "we now define a lattice boltzmann algorithm which solves the hydrodynamic equations of motion of a liquid crystal ( [ qevolution ] ) , ( [ continuity ] ) , and ( [ ns ] ) .",
    "lattice boltzmann algorithms are defined in terms of a set of continuous variables , usefully termed partial distribution functions , which move on a lattice in discrete space and time .",
    "they were first developed as mean - field versions of cellular automata simulations but can also usefully be viewed as a particular finite - difference implementation of the continuum equations of motion@xcite .",
    "lattice boltzmann approaches have been particularly successful in modeling fluids which evolve to minimise a free energy@xcite .",
    "it is not proven why this is the case , but one can surmise that the existence of an h - theorem , which governs the approach to equilibrium , helps to enhance the stability of the scheme@xcite .",
    "the simplest lattice boltzmann algorithm , which describes the navier - stokes equations of a simple fluid , is defined in terms of a single set of partial distribution functions which sum on each site to give the density . for liquid crystal hydrodynamics",
    "this must be supplemented by a second set , which are tensor variables , and which are related to the tensor order parameter @xmath0 .",
    "a description of the algorithm is given in section [ c2 ] and the continuum limit is taken in section [ c3 ] .",
    "a chapman - enskog expansion@xcite showing how the algorithm reproduces the liquid crystal equations of motion follows in section [ c4 ] .",
    "we define two distribution functions , the scalars @xmath25 and the symmetric traceless tensors @xmath26 on each lattice site @xmath27 .",

    ". they are obtained from equations ( [ eq2 ] ) and ( [ eq3 ] ) but with @xmath35 and @xmath36 set to @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "discretizing in this way , which is similar to a predictor - corrector scheme , has the advantages that lattice viscosity terms are eliminated to second order and that the stability of the scheme is improved .",
    "the collision operators are taken to have the form of a single relaxation time boltzmann equation@xcite , together with a forcing term @xmath39    the form of the equations of motion and thermodynamic equilibrium follow from the choice of the moments of the equilibrium distributions @xmath40 and @xmath41 and the driving terms @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "@xmath44 is constrained by @xmath45 where the zeroth and first moments are chosen to impose conservation of mass and momentum .",
    "the second moment of @xmath46 controls the symmetric part of the stress tensor , whereas the moments of @xmath42 @xmath47 impose the antisymmetric part of the stress tensor . for the equilibrium of the order parameter distribution",
    "we choose @xmath48 this ensures that the order parameter is convected with the flow .",
    "finally the evolution of the order parameter is most conveniently modeled by choosing @xmath49 which ensures that the fluid minimises its free energy at equilibrium .",
    "conditions ( [ eq6])([eq9 ] ) can be satisfied as is usual in lattice boltzmann schemes by writing the equilibrium distribution functions and forcing terms as polynomial expansions in the velocity@xcite @xmath50 where @xmath51 identifies separate coefficients for different absolute values of the velocities .",
    "a suitable choice is @xmath52 where any coefficients not listed are zero .",
    "we write down the continuum limit of the lattice boltzmann evolution equations ( [ eq2 ] ) and ( [ eq3 ] ) showing , in particular , that the predictor - corrector form of the collision integral eliminates lattice viscosity effects to second order .",
    "consider equation ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "taylor expanding @xmath37 gives @xmath53 where @xmath54 .",
    "similarly , expanding the collision term equation([eq4 ] ) , @xmath55 and substituting into equation ( [ eq2 ] ) gives @xmath56 we see immediately that @xmath57 using equation([eq18 ] ) in the expansion ( [ eq17 ] ) it follows that there are no terms of order @xmath58 in ( [ eq17 ] ) and @xmath59 a similar expansion of equation ( [ eq3 ] ) leads to @xmath60    in the standard lattice boltzmann discretization terms of order @xmath58 appear in equations ( [ eq19 ] ) and ( [ eq20 ] ) .",
    "these are of similar forms to those which arise from the chapman - enskog expansion and have been subsumed into the viscosity .",
    "however this is not generally possible and it is convenient to use the predictor - corrector form for the collision term assumed in equations ( [ eq4 ] ) and ( [ eq5 ] ) to eliminate them at this stage .      we can now proceed with a chapman - enskog expansion , an expansion of the distribution functions about equilibrium , which assumes that successive derivatives are of increasingly high order@xcite .",
    "the aim is to show that equation ( [ eq20 ] ) reproduces the evolution equation of the liquid crystal order parameter ( [ qevolution ] ) and equation ( [ eq19 ] ) the continuity and navier - stokes equations ( [ continuity ] ) and ( [ ns ] ) to second order in derivatives . writing @xmath61 and substituting into ( [ eq20 ] ) using the form for the collision term ( [ eq5 ] ) gives , to zeroth order @xmath62 summing over @xmath63 and using , from equations ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq8 ] ) , @xmath64 shows that the zeroth moment of @xmath43 appears at first order in the chapman - enskog expansion .",

    "3 .   using equation ( [ eq90 ] ) @xmath85 4 .   from equation ( [ eq91 ] ) the fourth term is of third order in derivatives and can be neglected .    replacing the square brackets in the equation ( [ eq37 ] ) with the contributions from @xmath86 and @xmath87 we obtain the incompressible navier - stokes equation ( [ ns ] ) .",
    "the primary aim of this paper is to describe the details of a numerical algorithm for simulating liquid crystal hydrodynamics .",
    "therefore we restrict ourselves here to presenting a few , brief , test cases , aimed at checking the approach .",
    "further numerical applications are listed in the summary of the paper and will be presented in detail elsewhere .    in equilibrium with no flow",
    "the free energy ( [ free ] ) is minimised . for a generic lyotropic liquid crystal",
    "we take @xmath88 and @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is doi s excluded volume parameter @xcite .",

    "the variation of @xmath23 with @xmath98 can be calculated analytically .",
    "agreement with simulation results is excellent as shown in figure 1 .",
    "imposing a shear on the system in the nematic phase will act to align the director field along the flow gradient . assuming a steady - state , homogeneous flow and a uniaxial nematic state , it follows from ( [ qevolution ] ) that the angle between the direction of flow and the director , @xmath99 , is given by @xcite @xmath100 the simulations reproduce this relation well as shown in figure 2 for different values of @xmath23 and @xmath12 .",
    "when there is no solution to equation ( [ eq80 ] ) the director tumbles in the flow or may move out of the plane to form a log - rolling state@xcite .",
    "figure 3 gives an example of this type of behavior , showing the director angle as a function of time .",
    "olmsted and goldbart@xcite have argued that shear stress acts to favour the nematic over the isotropic phase",
    ". hence application of shear moves the phase boundary , which extends from the first - order equilibrium transition at zero shear along a line of first - order transitions which end at a non - equilibrium critical point .",
    "numerical results for this boundary are shown in figure 4 .",
    "the results are qualitatively similar to those of @xcite who obtained the phase boundary for a slightly different model using an interface stability argument .    on the coexistence line",
    "the liquid crystal prefers to phase separate into shear bands @xcite , coexisting regions of different strain rate running parallel to the shear direction . such shear banding occurs spontaneously in the simulations reported here .",
    "an example is shown in figure 5 .",
    "in this paper we described in detail a lattice boltzmann algorithm to simulate liquid crystal hydrodynamics . in the continuum limit we recover the beris - edwards formulation within which the liquid crystal equations of motion are written in terms of a tensor order parameter .",
    "the equations are applicable to the isotropic , uniaxial nematic , and biaxial nematic phases . working within the framework of a variable tensor order parameter it is possible to simulate the dynamics of topological defects and non - equilibrium phase transitions between different flow regimes .",
    "lattice boltzmann simulations have worked well for complex fluids where a free energy can be used to define thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "however previous work has concentrated on self - assembly with much less attention being paid to more complex flow properties .",
    "the algorithm described here includes coupling between the order parameter and the flow .",
    "this allows the investigation of non - newtonian effects such as shear - thinning and shear - banding .",
    "examples are given in section iv .",
    "there are many directions for further research opened up by the rich physics inherent in liquid crystal hydrodynamics and the generality of the beris - edwards equations .",
    "for example results for liquid crystals under poiseuille flow show that the director configuration can depend on the sample history as well as the viscous coefficients and thermodynamic parameters@xcite .",
    "the effect of hydrodynamics on phase ordering is being investigated@xcite and it would be interesting to study the pathways by which different dynamic states transform into each other .",
    "the addition of an electric field to the equations of motion will allow problems relevant to liquid crystal displays to be addressed .",
    "numerical investigations are proving vital as the complexity of the equations makes analytic progress difficult .",
    "we outline how the beris - edwards equations reduce to those of ericksen , leslie , and parodi in the uniaxial nematic phase when the magnitude of the order parameter remains constant .",
    "hence we obtain expressions for the leslie coefficients in terms of the parameters appearing in the equations of motion ( [ qevolution ] ) and ( [ ns])@xcite .",
    "taking @xmath101 to represent the order - parameter field the ericksen - leslie stress tensor and the equation of motion for the order parameter are , respectively@xcite , @xmath102 together with the relations @xmath103 the second of these , known as parodi s relation , is a result of onsager reciprocity .",

    "using equations ( [ h(n , n , d ) ] ) and ( [ qdef ] ) the symmetric ( [ bestress ] ) and antisymmetric ( [ as ] ) parts of the beris - edwards stress tensor become , respectively , @xmath120 where we have ignored the final , distortion , term in ( [ bestress ] ) .",
    "a comparison of ( [ tauel ] ) and ( [ sigmael ] ) to ( [ aaa ] ) gives the leslie coefficients ( [ el1])([el6 ] ) .",
