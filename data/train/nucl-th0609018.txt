    "self - consistent mean - field models with effective energy - density functionals ( skyrme - hartree - fock , gogny , relativistic ) are established as reliable tools for description of nuclear structure and dynamics , for a comprehensive review see @xcite . in particular , there is a rising implementation of these models to dynamical features of nuclei ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , which is caused , to a large extend , by exploiting the spectra and reaction rates of exotic nuclei in astrophysics @xcite .",
    "however , applications of self - consistent models to nuclear dynamics are still limited even in the linear regime which is usually treated within the random - phase - approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "the calculations are plagued by dealing with high - rank rpa matrices .",
    "this is especially painful for deformed systems where lack of symmetry requires a huge one - particle - one - hole @xmath3 configuration space .",
    "the rpa problem becomes much simpler if the residual two - body interaction is factorized ( i.e. reduced to a separable form ) : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a hermitian @xmath6 operator and @xmath7 is a matrix of strength constants .",
    "the factorization allows to reduce a high - rank rpa matrix matrix to much smaller one with a rank 4k ( where the coefficient 4 is caused by the isospin and time - parity factors , see discussion at the next section ) .",
    "the separable expansion can be formulated in a fully self - consistent manner and provide a high accuracy with a small number ( k @xmath8 ) of the separable terms .",
    "several self - consistent schemes for separable expansions have been proposed during the last decades @xcite . however , these schemes were not sufficiently general . some of them are limited to analytical or simple numerical estimates @xcite , the others are not fully self - consistent @xcite . between them",
    "the approach @xcite for skyrme forces is quite promising .",
    "however , it still deals with rpa matrices of rather high rank ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "recently , we have developed a general self - consistent separable rpa ( srpa ) approach applicable to arbitrary density- and current - dependent functionals @xcite .",
    "the method was implemented to the skyrme functional @xcite for both spherical @xcite and deformed @xcite nuclei . in srpa ,",
    "the one - body operators @xmath10 and associated strengths @xmath11 are unambiguously derived from the given energy - density functional . there remain no further adjustable parameters .",
    "the success of the expansion depends on an appropriate choice of the basic operators @xmath10 .",
    "experience with spherical srpa gives guidelines for an efficient choice such that a few separable terms suffice to reproduce accurately the exact rpa spectra @xcite .",
    "the success becomes possible due to the following factors : i ) an efficient self - consistent procedure @xcite based on sound physical arguments , ii ) proper inclusion of all parts of the residual interaction , time - even as well as time - odd couplings , iii ) incorporation of the symmetries ( translation , particle number , ... ) leading to a correct description of the related zero - energy modes , iv ) building the separable operators by such a way that they have maxima at different slices of the nucleus and thus cover both surface and interior dynamics .",
    "furthermore , we note that srpa is very general and can be applied to a wide variety of finite fermion systems .",
    "for example , srpa was derived for the kohn - sham functional @xcite and widely used for description of linear dynamics of valence electrons in spherical and deformed atomic clusters @xcite .",
    "the enormous reduction of computational expense by srpa is particularly advantageous for deformed systems where 1ph configuration space grows huge .",
    "srpa becomes here a promising tool for large scale studies .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to present a first implementation of srpa for axially deformed nuclei with pairing . like the full rpa",
    ", srpa follows two strategies to compute the dynamical response .",
    "it can be calculated via determination of rpa eigenvalues and eigenstates or by a direct computation of the multipole strength functions related to experimental cross sections .",
    "we will discuss both ways .",
    "as a first test , we will apply the method to description of isovector e1 and isoscalar e2 giant resonance ( gr ) in the deformed nuclei @xmath0sm , @xmath1u , and @xmath2no .",
    "these nuclei cover a broad size range from rare - earth to super - heavy elements .",
    "four different skyrme forces ( skt6 @xcite , skm * @xcite , sly6 @xcite , and ski3 @xcite ) will be used to explore dependence of the results on the actual parametrization . for our aims",
    "it is important that these forces represent different values of some relevant nuclear matter characteristics ( isoscalar and isovector effective masses and asymmetry energy ) .",
    "we will discuss dependence of the collective strength on these characteristics , scrutinize the impact of time - odd coupling terms in the skyrme residual interaction and demonstrate important role of the landau fragmentation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the general srpa formalism is presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : srpa ] and specified for skyrme forces in sec .",

    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "some important details of the method are given in appendices a - c .",

    "in the most general form , the factorization of the residual interaction ( [ 1 ] ) reads    @xmath12    where the indices @xmath13 and @xmath14 label neutrons and protons , @xmath15 are time - even hermitian one - body operators and @xmath16 are their time - odd counterparts , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the strength matrices .",
    "time reversal properties of the operators are @xmath19 t\\hat{y}_{sk}t^{-1 } & = & \\gamma_t^y \\hat{y}_{sk } & , &   \\gamma_t^y=-1 & , \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the operator of time reversal .",
    "the expansion ( [ v_sep ] ) needs to take care of both classes of operators since the relevant skyrme functionals involve both time - even and time - odd couplings , see @xcite and appendix [ sec : dens_curr ] . though time - odd variables do not contribute to the",
    "mean field hamiltonian of spin - saturated systems , they can play a role in time - dependent perturbations and nuclear dynamics .",
    "altogether , the presence of time - even and time - odd couplings in the functional naturally leads to a formulation of the separable model in terms of hermitian operators with a given time - parity .",
    "these operators have the useful property @xmath21>=0 }    \\langle   [ \\hat{a},\\hat{b } ] \\rangle \\sim ( 1-\\gamma_t^a\\gamma_t^b)\\ ] ] which means that the average value of the commutator at the ground state @xmath22 is not zero only for operators of the opposite t - parities @xmath23 .",
    "this property will be widely used in the following .",
    "rpa is the limit of small - amplitude harmonic vibrations around the ground state .",
    "the dynamics is formulated in general by a time - dependent variation on the basis of a given energy functional @xmath24 @xmath25 we deal with a set of densities @xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes the type of density ( spatial density , kinetic density , current , spin density , spin - orbit density , ... ) and @xmath13 labels protons and neutrons . for reasons of compact notation , we combine the density type @xmath27 with the space point @xmath28 into one index @xmath29 such that @xmath30 the densities are related to the corresponding one - body operators @xmath31 ( see the list in appendix [ sec : dens_curr ] ) as @xmath32    further , the state @xmath33 is the underlying bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) mean - field state composed from the single - particle states @xmath34 and the corresponding pairing occupation amplitudes @xmath35 .",
    "the time - evolution is determined by variation of the action @xmath36 .",
    "till now we keep the occupation amplitudes @xmath35 fixed at their ground state values and consider the variation of the single particle states .",
    "this yields the time - dependent mean - field equations as @xmath37 with the mean field hamiltonain @xmath38 being a functional of the local and instantaneous densities @xmath39 .",
    "the freezing of the occupation amplitudes @xmath35 somewhat inhibits application of srpa for vibrational modes with a strong pairing impact ( e.g. for low - lying modes in neutron - rich light deformed nuclei ) @xcite . however , in the present study we are interested in giant resonances where pairing dynamics plays a minor role .    in the linear regime of small amplitude oscillations , the time - dependent state consists of the static ground state @xmath40 and a small time - dependent perturbation @xmath41 where both @xmath42 and @xmath22 are bcs states .",
    "hence , all dynamical quantities can be decomposed as a sum of the stationary ground state and small time - dependent parts :    [ eq : dens_j(t ) ] @xmath43    inserting ( [ eq : dens_j(t ) ] ) into ( [ eq : e(j ) ] ) and keeping the terms up to the first order in @xmath44 , one obtains the single - particle hamiltonian @xmath45 with the static mean - field part @xmath46 and the time - dependent response @xmath47 related to the oscillations of the system .",
    "note that the second functional derivative is to be taken at the ground state density as indicated by the index @xmath48 .",
    "this holds for all second functional derivatives and so we will skip this explicit index in the following . for the brevity of notation , we will also skip the explicit dependencies on space coordinates and come back to these details in sec . [",
    "sec : skyrme ] where the residual interaction for the skyrme functional is worked out .",
    "the linearized equation of motion reads @xmath49 further steps require a more specific view of @xmath50 .",
    "this will be done in the next subsections from different points of view , macroscopic and microscopic .",
    "it is convenient to obtain the perturbed mean - field state @xmath51 by the scaling transformation @xcite @xmath52    \\exp [ -ip_{sk}(t)\\hat{q}_{s k } ]    | \\rangle_s\\ ] ] where both @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the slater determinants and @xmath55 and @xmath56 are generalized coordinate ( time - even ) and momentum ( time - odd ) hermitian one - body operators .",
    "these operators fulfill the properties    [ eq : q_p ] @xmath57=\\hat{p}_{sk}^{\\dagger},\\quad \\gamma_t^p=-1\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath58 stands for the full hamiltonian embracing both the one - body mean - field hamiltonian and the two - body residual interaction .",
    "the commutator in ( [ eq : p ] ) is assumed to be mapped into the one - body domain ( see , e.g. , the mapping into @xmath59 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h_xy ] ) ) .",
    "if the functional includes only time - even densities , then @xmath60 does not contribute to the commutator and so @xmath61 can be safely replaced by @xmath62 .",
    "the operators ( [ eq : q_p ] ) generate time - even and time - odd real collective deformations @xmath63 and @xmath64 . using ( [ eq : scaling ] ) and assuming only small deformations , the transition densities ( [ eq : j(t)_psi ] ) read @xmath65 \\rangle \\\\ & & \\qquad\\ ; + p_{s k}(t ) \\langle [ \\hat{q}_{s k},\\hat j_{s}^{\\alpha } ] \\rangle\\ } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , following ( [ eq:<[a , b]>=0 ] ) , time - even densities contribute only to responses @xmath66|\\rangle$ ] while time - odd ones only to @xmath67|\\rangle$ ] .",
    "then the response hamiltonian ( [ eq : h_resp ] ) recasts as @xmath68 where the time dependence is concentrated in the amplitudes @xmath63 and @xmath64 while all time - independent terms are collected in the hermitian one - body operators    [ eq : x_y ] @xmath69 \\rangle { \\hat j}_{s'}^{\\alpha ' } , \\ ] ] @xmath70 \\rangle { \\hat j}_{s'}^{\\alpha'}\\ ] ]    with the properties    [ xy - properties ] @xmath71    obviously , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the reasonable candidates for the time - even and time - odd operators in the separable expansion ( [ v_sep ] ) .",

    "we will employ a representative set of skyrme forces , skt6 @xcite , skm * @xcite , sly6 @xcite , and ski3 @xcite , with different features ( isoscalar and isovector effective masses , asymmetry energy , ... ) .",
    "these forces are widely used for description of ground state properties and dynamics of atomic nuclei @xcite including deformed ones . as is seen from table 1 , the forces span a variety of nuclear matter properties while all correctly reproducing experimental values of the quadrupole moments in @xmath0sm and @xmath1u .",

    "experimental values of the quadrupole moment in @xmath0sm and @xmath1u are 6.6 b and 11.1 b , respectively @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the calculations use a cylindrical coordinate - space grid with the spacing of 0.7 fm .",
    "pairing is treated at the bcs level and is frozen in the dynamical calculations . the collective response for the gdr ( @xmath207 ) and gqr ( @xmath208 ) is computed with two input operators ( [ eq : scale_op ] ) at k=1 and 2 .",
    "both gr are calculated in terms of the energy - weighted ( l=1 ) strength function ( [ eq : sf_1 ] ) with the averaging parameter @xmath118= 2 mev ( as most suitable for the comparison with the experiment ) .",
    "the factorization of the residual interaction and the strength function technique dramatically reduce the computational effort .",
    "for example , by using a pc with cpu pentium 4 ( 3.0 ghz ) we need about 25 minutes for the complete calculations of the gdr in @xmath1u , including 1 minute for computation of the strength function itself .",
    "the isovector gdr and isoscalar gqr are calculated with the effective charges @xmath209 , @xmath210 and @xmath211 , respectively . the isoscalar dipole spurious mode is located at 2 - 3 mev .",
    "the deviation from the desirable zero energy is caused by several reasons .",
    "first , we have neglected in the present study the contribution from the coulomb residual interaction .",
    "the second ( more important ) reason is that the nucleus is treated in a finite coordinate box , which artificially binds the center of mass .",
    "larger numerical boxes could help here but at quickly increasing computational cost . in any case",
    ", it suffices for our present purposes that the center - of - mass mode lies at a low energy and thus is safely separated from the gdr .",
    "we use a large configuration space including the single - particle spectrum from the bottom of the potential well up to @xmath212 mev .",
    "this results in 7000 - 10000 dipole and 11000 - 17000 quadrupole two - quasiparticle configurations in the energy interval 0 - 100 mev .",
    "the relevant energy - weighted sum rules are exhausted by @xmath213 .",
    "such a basis is certainly enough for the present aims .",
    "results of the calculations are presented in figs . 1 - 3 .",
    "the first two figures compare the calculated gdr and gqr with the available photoabsorption @xcite and @xmath214 @xcite experimental data .",

    ", width=302,height=396 ]    to illustrate accuracy of the method , we give for @xmath2no the strength functions calculated with one ( k=1 ) and two ( k=1,2 ) input operators .",
    "it is seen that both cases are about equal for the gqr with its simple one - bump structure . at the same time",
    ", the second operator considerably changes gross structure of the more complicated gdr .",
    "we have checked that inclusion of more operators ( k @xmath215 3 ) does not result in further significant modification of the gdr .",
    "so , the approximation of two input operators seems to be reasonable , at least for the present study at a resolution of 2 mev .",
    "the figures also show the unperturbed strengths , i.e. the mere two - quasiparticle ( 2qp ) distributions without the residual interaction .",
    "comparison of these strengths with the fully coupled collective strengths ( solid curves ) displays the collective e1 and e2 shifts . as a trivial fact",
    ", we observe the proper right shift for the isovector gdr and the left shift for the isoscalar gqr .",
    "what is more interesting , the shifts for both resonances ( including isovector dgr ) depend on the _ isoscalar _ effective mass @xmath202 . to explain this , one should remind that the smaller @xmath202 , the more stretched the single - particle spectrum @xcite ( see also relevant examples in @xcite ) . and indeed the e1 and e2 unperturbed strengths in the figures exhibit a systematic shift to higher energy while moving from skt6 to ski3 ( for e1 the shift is essentially weaker than for e2 @xcite ) .",
    "simultaneously , we have the corresponding evolution of the collective energy shifts .",
    "namely , they decrease for gdr and increase for gqr ( for exception of gdr for skt6 ) .",
    "all these trends lead to a remarkable net result : strong variations of the unperturbed strengths and collective shifts with @xmath202 considerably compensate each other so as the final gdr and gqr energies become much less sensitive to different skyrme forces and approach the experimental values .",
    "the remaining energy differences of order @xmath216 mev show some other , sometimes known , trends for the gr .",
    "first , we see a systematic ( for exception of skt6 ) downshift of the calculated gdr with increasing the symmetry energy @xmath203 .",
    "this , at first glance , surprising result complies with experience of the systematic studies in spherical nuclei @xcite .",
    "the case of skt6 looks as exception from this simple rule .",
    "it has the same asymmetry energy as skm@xmath217 ( see table [ tab : skyrme ] ) but a lower gdr resonance peak .",
    "this comes because the density dependence @xmath218 is abnormally low here ( for reasons whose discussion goes beyond the scope of the present paper ) . besides the trend with @xmath203 , fig .",
    "[ fig : e1 ] also hints a connection of the gdr energy with the sum rule enhancement factor @xmath204 and the related value of the _ isovector _ effective mass @xmath219 .",
    "namely , the smaller the effective mass ( larger the @xmath204 ) , the higher the gdr .",
    "the trends and connections mentioned above should , however , be considered with a bit of care .",
    "indeed , the variation of @xmath203 between the different skyrme forces in table [ tab : skyrme ] is rather small and probably not enough to demonstrate a strong and unambiguous trend . besides , a complicated dependence of gdr on _ different _ isovector factors can spoil and entangle the concrete trends . in any case , analysis of the dgr trends deserves more systematic study which is now in reach with the efficient srpa technique .    instead , the evolution of isoscalar gqr is more clear and systematic .",
    "we see a steady upshift of the gqr peak from skt6@xmath217 to ski3 , which complies with the known dependence on the isoscalar effective mass @xmath202 @xcite , namely , the lower the effective mass , the higher the gqr .",
    "this trend has a simple explanation . as was discussed above , the low @xmath202 results in stretching the single - particle spectrum and thus in the upshift of the 2qp quadrupole strength . in the gqr case ,",
    "the opposite dependence of the collective shift is not enough to compensate the strong 2qp upshift and hence we obtain the trend .",
    "note that in our calculations skt6 with @xmath220 yields the best agreement for the gqr .",
    "this confirms to some extend the findings @xcite for @xmath221pb that a good reproduction of the gqr requires a large effective mass .",
    "shape and width of gr in deformed nuclei are mainly determined by the deformation splitting and the spectral fragmentation due to interference with energetically close @xmath6 states ( landau fragmentation ) .",
    "following table [ tab : skyrme ] , the different skyrme forces provide quite similar quadrupole moments .",
    "hence they result in close deformation splittings .",
    "instead , the landau fragmentation depends sensitively on the spectral pattern of a model , determined in a large extent by isoscalar and isovector effective masses .",
    "our samples of forces contain sufficient variation of both ones .",
    "nonetheless , it turns out that the width and shape of the gqr are practically the same for all the four skyrme forces .    at the same time",
    ", the strongest variation is found for the gdr whose width and gross - structure significantly depend on the force .",
    "it is seen that skm * gives an artificial third right peak ( especially in @xmath0sm ) and thus an overestimation of the gdr width .",
    "this effect weakens for sly6 ( leading to the best description of gdr ) and vanishes at all for ski3 ( resulting in underestimation of the resonance width ) .",
    "the appearance of the artificial right shoulder for skm * and sly6 was already noted for deformed rare - earth and actinide nuclei @xcite and @xmath221pb @xcite . for the particular skyrme forces",
    ", this effect seems to be universal .",
    "it takes place for gdr in heavy nuclei , independently on their shape .",
    "as is shown in @xcite , the right shoulder is provoked by an excessive collective shift and further enforced by the presence in the region of the 2qp bunch composed from the particular high - moment configurations ( @xmath222 and @xmath223 for @xmath0sm and @xmath224 and @xmath225 for @xmath1u and @xmath2no ) @xcite .",
    "these configurations represent the intruder @xmath226 states entering the valence shell due to the strong spin - orbital splitting .",
    "they form a dense 2qp bunch which is easily excited and thus provides high sensitivity of the right gdr flank",
    ". this feature can be useful for additional selection of the parameters of skyrme forces",
    ".    it would be very interesting to relate the above results for the gdr width and profile with the effective masses .",
    "some possible correlations can immediately be noted .",
    "for example , the evolution of the right shoulder from skm * to ski3 seems to correlate with a systematic decrease of @xmath202 . besides",
    ", the largest right shoulder in skm * can be related with the smallest value of @xmath219 for this force .",
    "this conclusion , however , requires still confirmation from more extended studies with an even broader basis of forces . at the same time , the results hint that the properties of the isovector gdr probably depend not only on the isovector @xmath219 but also on the isoscalar @xmath202 . for the first glance",
    ", this statement looks surprising .",
    "however , we should take into account that @xmath227 influences the mean level spacings @xmath228 in the mean field and hence can in principle affect the gdr .",
    "the resonance should depend on the ground state properties which in turn are related to @xmath227 .",
    "it worth also noting that both @xmath202 and @xmath219 are generated by one and the same term of the skyrme functional ( @xmath229 ) and so probably are not fully decoupled in the dynamics . some non - trivial relations between isoscalar and isovector parameters",
    "are already discussed in literature , e.g. the relation @xmath230 and its connection with @xmath231 @xcite .",
    "and we see here an interesting field for future investigations .",
    "the isovector gdr and isoscalar gqr in @xmath1u calculated with the skyrme forces skt6 , skm * , sly6 and ski3 .",
    "the strength is calculated with ( solid curve ) and without ( dash curve ) contribution of the time - odd current .",
    ", width=264,height=396 ]    as a next step , let s consider contributions of the time - odd densities to the gdr and gqr .",
    "these results are illustrated in fig .",
    "the calculations show that only the current - current contribution ( [ de_dj_dj ] ) is essential while the contribution ( [ de_dj_dsigma ] ) connected with the spin density is negligible .",
    "so , in fig .",
    "3 we display only effect of the current density .",
    "first of all , it is worth noting that the most significant changes appear again at the right flank of the resonances . probably , the high - moment @xmath226-configurations mentioned above play important role not only for gdr but for gqr as well .",
    "the impact of the time - odd current is different in gdr and gqr . in the quadrupole resonance , we see the systematic downshift and narrowing the strength . there is a clear correlation with the value of the isoscalar effective mass : the lower @xmath202 , the stronger the time - odd effect .",
    "after inclusion of the time - odd coupling , the gqr for different @xmath202 become much closer .",
    "so , the time - odd contribution weakens the influence of @xmath202 .    in the dipole resonance ,",
    "the time - odd shift is not so systematic .",
    "we observe no shift for skt6 , the upshift for skm * and the downshifts for sly6 and ski3 .",
    "again one may note some correlation with effective masses .",
    "the specific skm * case can be connected with very small @xmath219 for this force . besides",
    ", one may note ( for exception of skm * ) increasing the time - odd impact with lowering @xmath202 . in principle , the correlations between the influence of time - odd terms and effective masses in both gdr and gqr cases were more or less expected because the current density enters the term of the skyrme functional @xmath229 just responsible for generation of the effective masses .",
    "this explains why the skt6 case with @xmath232 ( no effective mass effects ) does not demonstrate any time - odd impact .",
    "it is worth noting that the dominant contributions to the collective response from the principle terms of the skyrme functional have different signs and thus , in a large extent , compensate each other ( this can be easily checked in the srpa by estimation of the different contributions to the inverse strength constants ( [ eq : kappa - eta ] ) . as a result , the smaller contributions ( time - odd , spin - orbital and coulomb ) become important .",
    "the present study involves three nuclei from different mass regions and four skyrme forces with various bulk properties .",
    "we have yet to disentangle more carefully the separate influences of them .",
    "this requires systematic variations of forces in a large set of test cases .",
    "such systematic studies can be now easily performed due to the computationally efficient srpa method .",
    "a general procedure for the self - consistent factorization of the residual nuclear interaction is proposed for arbitrary density- and current - dependent functionals . following this procedure ,",

    "the densities read as @xmath236 where @xmath237 is the density operator , @xmath238 is the wave function of the single - particle state @xmath88 , and @xmath239 is the pairing occupation weight .",
    "cylindrical coordinates @xmath240 are defined as @xmath241    then the single - particle particle wave function and its time reversal have the form of spinors @xmath242 @xmath243 where @xmath244 is the projection of the complete single - particle moment onto symmetry z - axis of the axial nucleus .",
    "expressions for differential operators in cylindrical coordinates are elsewhere , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the pairing is treated with bardin - coopper - schriffer ( bcs ) method .",
    "then the srpa values gain the pairing factors involving coefficients @xmath245 and @xmath246 of the bogoliubov transformation from particles to quasiparticles .",
    "the densities and currents in the skyrme functional dominate in the particle - hole channel .",
    "the pairing density falls into another channel provided by the two - particle excitations .",
    "it involves a different pairing weight , namely @xmath247 rather then the @xmath239 for the standard densities ( [ eq : dens ] ) .",
    "specifically the pairing density reads @xmath248    in the case of pairing , the hermitian one - body operators with a given time - parity ( @xmath249 ) obtain in the @xmath90-channel the form @xmath250 where @xmath251 are two - quasiparticle operators and @xmath252 are the pairing factors .",
    "this is the case for time - even operators @xmath253 and @xmath254 and the time - odd operator @xmath255 . the time - odd operator @xmath256 = i \\ { [ \\hat h_{0 } , \\hat q_{sk } ] + [ \\hat v_{\\rm res}^{\\rm sep } , \\hat q_{sk } ] \\ }",
    "\\nonumber\\\\ & = & i [ \\hat h_{0 } , \\hat q_{sk } ] - \\hat y_{sk}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] have a more complicated form because of the additional term @xmath257 $ ] . namely it reads @xmath258    the srpa formalism in sections [ sec : srpa ] and [ sec : skyrme ] is presented in a general form equally suitable for the cases with and without pairing . in the case of pairing , the ground and perturbed @xmath6 many - body wave functions are replaced by their bcs counterparts , the summation indices @xmath177 and @xmath178 run the quasiparticle states , and the involved values ( densities , operators and matrix elements ) acquire the pairing factors given above .",
    "the pairing is not important for giant resonances considered in the present study .",
    "so , we freeze the pairing in the dynamics and do not present here the explicit form of the pairing contribution ( pairing vibrations ) to the residual interaction . some examples of this contribution can be found in @xcite .",
