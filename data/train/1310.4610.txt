    "entanglement @xcite is a unique feature of quantum theory having no analogue in classical physics .",
    "spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) has been used as a source of entangled photon pairs for more than two decades @xcite and provides an efficient way to generate non - classical states of light for fundamental tests of nature @xcite , for quantum information processing @xcite or for quantum metrology @xcite .",
    "entanglement between two photons emitted by spdc can occur in one or several ( hyperentanglement @xcite ) possible degrees of freedom of light , namely polarization , transverse momentum and energy .",
    "polarization entanglement @xcite has been used in many experiments even involving multiple pair states @xcite . however , because light supports only two polarization modes , the hilbert space of each photon is limited to a dimension of two ( qubits ) . on the other hand , entangling @xmath1-dimensional states denoted as qudits requires multi - mode states of light with @xmath2 .",
    "this can be for instance achieved using a specific discretization scheme of the transverse momentum degree of freedom .",
    "experiments have been performed where entanglement appears in a discrete set of orbital angular momentum modes @xcite , pixel modes @xcite and slit modes @xcite .",
    "the manipulation and detection of transverse entanglement mainly rely on the ability to experimentally address the transverse momentum modes with the help of holograms or spatial light modulators .",
    "the entanglement content is theoretically quantified by the schmidt number @xmath3 , and is , for usual parameters of the pump laser and the spdc crystal , on the order of 10 to 50 for transverse wave vector entanglement @xcite .",
    "similar schmidt numbers are in reach for energy - time entanglement generated by a short pump pulse @xcite but considerably higher values of @xmath3 can be obtained for spdc driven by a quasi - monochromatic pump laser . while high dimensional entanglement in the transverse momentum modes has been extensively studied , there is still a lack of experiments exploiting the energy degree of freedom to generate qudits for @xmath4 .",
    "thus far , qudits with @xmath5 were demonstrated via two - photon interferences in @xcite . in these experiments ,",
    "the entanglement was encoded in a time - bin basis realized by interferometers with multiple arms .",
    "time bins have been preferentially used as a basis for entangled qudits because they can be coherently manipulated by interferometers .",
    "however , the scalability to higher dimensions becomes prohibitively complex in view of interferometric stability .    by _ directly _ manipulating the photon spectrum , we demonstrate the implementation of various discretization schemes to realize entangled qudits .",
    "for this purpose we coherently address selected spectral components of the entangled photons by a spatial light modulator ( slm ) and make use of an ultrafast optical coincidence detection , i.e.  sum - frequency generation ( sfg ) @xcite . as compared to the aforementioned experiments using interferometric methods , this procedure is intrinsically phase stable and potentially scalable to very high dimensions .",
    "it has been used to investigate frequency - bin entangled qudits by quantum state tomography and bell measurements @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we demonstrate the versatility of the experiment by discretizing the continuous frequency space not only in frequency bins but in different other relevant orthogonal bases .",
    "specifically , in the time - bin basis and a basis obtained by a schmidt decomposition .",
    "moreover , we show that the presented method is well suited to gain physical insights , e.g.  with respect to the coherence time of the entangled photons in the time - bin basis .",
    "the projection onto schmidt modes further lays the groundwork for a reconstruction of the spdc state in terms of the schmidt basis in the frequency domain .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we introduce the general theoretical framework to discretize a continuous frequency space in a countable subspace together with three specific realizations : frequency bins , time bins and schmidt modes .",
    "subsequently , we describe the experimental setup in section 3 . in section 4 ,",
    "we experimentally demonstrate and quantify entanglement in the three bases by means of projective measurements equivalent to two - photon interferometry @xcite in the time - bin case .",
    "entangled qudits up to @xmath0 are analyzed within the context of a @xmath1-dimensional bell inequality .",
    "finally , we conclude this paper by discussing the limitations of the current setup and the possible improvements in view of higher dimensions .",
    "in the following , the theoretical framework of the experimental results presented hereafter is discussed according to the schematic shown in figure  [ fig : theory_scheme ] which allows , in a unified framework , the description of qudits encoding in any energy - time representation .",
    "the three main parts of the experiment : the preparation of energy - time entangled photons through spdc ; the subsequent manipulation of their spectrum using a slm ; and the detection through sfg .",
    "mathematical expressions for @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are derived in the corresponding subsections . ]      a coherent superposition of energy - time entangled idler ( @xmath10 ) and signal ( @xmath11 ) photon pairs occurs through vacuum fluctuations if a pump photon ( @xmath12 ) is annihilated in a spdc process . for a configuration where all involved photons are mutually collinear and identically polarized @xcite the corresponding two - photon state reads @xmath13 the operators @xmath14 act on the combined vacuum state @xmath15 to create the idler and signal photon with corresponding relative frequencies @xmath16 .",
    "the absolute frequency of the entangled photons is given by @xmath17 and @xmath18 denotes the central frequency of the pump photon . the joint spectral amplitude @xmath19 is written in terms of the pump envelope function @xmath20 and the phase matching function @xmath21 explicitly given by @xmath22 @xmath23\\nonumber\\\\ & \\times\\exp\\left({i\\frac{\\left(\\delta k_{dc}(\\omega_i,\\omega_s)+\\frac{2\\pi}{g_{dc}}\\right)l_{dc}}{2}}\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with a pump pulse that has a full width at half maximum of @xmath24 in the spectral intensity .",

    "the phase mismatch @xmath28 includes the dispersion properties of the spdc crystal through its corresponding sellmeier equations .",
    "the spectrum of the entangled photons is manipulated in amplitude and phase by a slm where the modulator action on each photon is described by a complex transfer function @xmath29 .",
    "the joint spectral amplitude is transformed by the slm to @xmath30 with @xmath31 where additional restrictions on @xmath7 are time - stationarity and @xmath32      in general , coincidence detection is essential to reveal entanglement .",
    "the state @xmath33 could be experimentally detected by a combination of narrow - band frequency filters and single photon counters .",
    "however , this would yield a signal proportional to @xmath34 which is insensitive to any phase modulation in @xmath7 . to circumvent this problem",
    "we seek for a detection scheme that yields a signal which is proportional to @xmath35 , the 2d fourier transform of ( [ eq : lambda_mod ] ) .",
    "such a scheme requires a time resolution better than the inverse of the photon s spectral bandwidth , which in our experiment is on the order of a few femtoseconds .",
    "this is about five orders of magnitudes smaller than the time resolution of the best single photon counters actually available .",
    "therefore , we resort to an optical coincidence method that relies on sfg in a nonlinear crystal . to account for its acceptance bandwidth , we define the modified joint spectral amplitude @xmath36 with @xmath37\\nonumber\\\\ & \\times\\exp\\left({i\\frac{\\left(\\delta k_{sfg}(\\omega_i,\\omega_s)-\\frac{2\\pi}{g_{sfg}}\\right)l_{sfg}}{2}}\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] analogous to @xmath21 , the length and the poling period of the sfg crystal are denoted by @xmath38 and @xmath39 with a phase mismatch @xmath40 .",
    "the temporal resolution of the sfg - based detection process is governed by the inverse width of @xmath41 and is sufficiently short . in the following we neglect the additional phase factors in ( [ eq : phi_dc ] ) and ( [ eq : phi_uc ] ) since they can not be distinguished from other dispersion contributions in the setup and are assumed to be compensated in the experiment .",
    "the detected signal after the sfg process is given by @xmath42 and is sensitive to a phase in the transfer function .      because of the finite spectral resolution of the optical setup at the position of the slm , one given frequency component illuminates several pixels of the slm . to describe this effect ,",
    "we convolve @xmath43 with the point spread function @xmath44 to obtain @xmath45 the width @xmath46 depends on the imaging distances and the optical elements within the experimental setup . equation ( [ eq : gamma_psf ] ) is in particular used to determine the schmidt basis functions in section [ schmidt ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : gamma ] depicts @xmath8 and @xmath47 showing that the effect of the psf is a considerable broadening of the joint spectral amplitude along the diagonal direction .      in order to quantify the degree of entanglement between the idler and signal photon we use the von neumann entropy @xmath48 .",
    "the entropy is commonly referred to be a valid quantifier of entanglement between two subsystems of a pure entangled state with individual density operators @xmath49 @xcite . through a numerical approximation method @xcite we calculated the entropy of @xmath6 and @xmath8 for a pump spectral bandwidth of @xmath50  mhz and further experimental parameters of the preparation and the detection crystals . for @xmath6",
    "we obtain @xmath51  ebits .",
    "the entropy is calculated to be @xmath52  ebits using @xmath8 i.e.  we observe almost no influence of the detection process on the degree of entanglement .",
    "this amount of entropy is the same as in a maximally bipartite entangled qudit state of dimension @xmath53 with @xmath54 .",
    "this demonstrates that spdc driven by a spectrally narrow - band pump field offers a potentially very high dimensional state space to encode qudits in frequency modes .",

    "the actual limitation to reach higher dimensions is the finite spectral resolution at the position of the slm .",
    "if we increase the density of bins , frequencies from adjacent bins will overlap and the orthonormality condition of ( [ eq : orthonormality ] ) begins to fail .",

    "the reduction of the bell parameter for large time delays between the two bins can also be attributed to the finite spectral resolution . here",
    ", it currently constrains even more the maximally accessible dimension .",
    "both of these methods have , however , the advantage that a perfect knowledge of the two - photon state is not required in order to discretize a maximally entangled state .",
    "in contrast , the schmidt decomposition is very sensitive to the form of the state generated by spdc .",
    "it is likely , that the theoretical @xmath47 deviates from the joint spectral amplitude realized in the experiment due to a lack in the precise knowledge of all the physical parameters used to compute the schmidt modes .",
    "this lowers the quality of the measured two - photon interference patterns in terms of their shape and the obtained coincidence count rate .",
    "we have presented a thorough theoretical description how to encode qudits in the frequency domain of energy - time entangled photons whose coincidences are detected through sfg in a nonlinear crystal . although applied to the specific case of a slm , the discretization procedure of the frequency space is general and describes a unified framework for different energy - time resolving experimental schemes .",
    "it has been discussed , that the entanglement content in a two - photon state generated by continuous wave parametric down - conversion is very high .",
    "however , it is reduced if the finite spectral resolution of the experimental setup is accounted for .",
    "the flexibility of a slm has been exploited in order to project the energy space of the entangled photons onto different bases . in particular , we implemented frequency and time bins to measure maximally entangled qudits through two - photon interference fringes .",
    "all qudits have been investigated in view of their entanglement properties by means of a generalized bell inequality .",
    "the time - bin scheme allowed to show the transition from a separable to a maximally entangled qubit state taking advantage of an ultrafast detection method with femtosecond temporal resolution .",
    "in addition , we expressed the two - photon wave function in a schmidt decomposition to use the resulting modes as a further basis for qudits .",
    "as the current limitation in the quality and dimension of the generated states , we identified the finite spectral resolution at the position of the slm in combination with the size and number of its pixels . a way to improve",
    "the spectral resolution is to replace the prisms with gratings .",
    "this would allow to spatially disperse the spectrum along a wider range of the slm display .",
    "the achievable dimension becomes then only limited by the number of pixels of the shaping device .",
    "the low efficiency coincidence detection method using sfg therefore constitutes a further bound on the dimension of the qudits .",
    "a higher coincidence rate could be achieved by generating sfg in a waveguide instead of a bulk crystal @xcite or using enhanced detection schemes @xcite .",
    "ultimately , time synchronized sum - frequency generation between a spdc photon and a femtosecond laser pulse provides an ultrafast coincidence detection method with an upconversion efficiency per pump pulse of about 25% as demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "a similar scheme could be realized using two spatially separated upconversion crystals allowing to perform an ultrafast and non - local coincidence detection on separated photons .",
    "this , however , additionally requires the replacement of the continuous wave pump with a pulsed pump laser in order to increase the duty cycle .",
    "such a modification of the here presented experimental setup would finally provide the necessary detection efficiency to perform quantum communication processing .",
    "that a state can be precisely characterized in terms of its schmidt decomposition was shown in @xcite for transverse momentum entangled photons .",
    "the here presented experimental setup allows for projective measurements on single schmidt modes @xmath151 in the frequency domain .",
    "a state reconstruction similar to @xcite can then be performed in the entangled photons energy - time degrees of freedom provided the correct eigenfunctions are known .",
    "the obtained @xmath137 can further be used to calculate the schmidt number to quantify the entanglement in the state .",
    "the above mentioned improvements will allow to encode qudits in dimensions inaccessible by standard interferometry .",
