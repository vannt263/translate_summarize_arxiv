    "two solar system discoveries have recently puzzled the astronomical community : the existence of near - earth objects ( neos , perihelion distance less than 1.3 au and , if a comet , orbital period less than 200 yr ) moving on retrograde orbits and the clustering of orbits around argument of perihelion , @xmath1 , close to 0for extreme trans - neptunian objects ( etnos , semimajor axis greater than 150 au and perihelion distance greater than 30 au ) .",
    "there are only 11 known retrograde neos : three asteroids  ( 343158 ) 2009 hc@xmath2 , 2007 va@xmath3 and 2014 pp@xmath4  and eight comets ( 55p / tempel - tuttle , 1p / halley , p/2005 t4 ( swan ) , c/2010 l5 ( wise ) , 273p / pons - gambart , c/2001 w2 ( batters ) , 109p / swift - tuttle and 161p / hartley - iras ) .",
    "the number of known near - earth asteroids ( neas ) is 11490 and the number of near - earth comets ( necs ) is 165 .",
    "retrograde objects represent a tiny fraction , 0.094 per cent , of the neo population .",

    "( 2012 ) unveiled a dynamical mechanism capable of inducing ordinary asteroid orbits to flip to a retrograde configuration while trapped in the 3:1 mean motion resonance with jupiter near 2.5 au .",
    "these authors predict that nearly 0.1 per cent of the neo population could follow retrograde orbits .",
    "nearly all known etnos have @xmath1 close to 0(the average value is -31@xmath550 , see a discussion in trujillo & sheppard 2014 ; de la fuente marcos & de la fuente marcos 2014b ) .",
    "an existing observational bias strongly favours the detection of etnos at @xmath1 close to 0and 180yet no objects have been found at 180(trujillo & sheppard 2014 ; de la fuente marcos & de la fuente marcos 2014b ) .",
    "no plausible explanation has been offered so far to account for the apparent lack of objects with @xmath1 around 180 .",
    "the perplexing puzzle posed by the apparent lack of such objects among known members of the etno population is not the only unusual pattern displayed by the orbital parameters of this interesting group of trans - plutonian objects ( see fig . 3 in de la fuente marcos & de la fuente marcos 2014b ) .",
    "the orbital elements of these objects ( see table [ etnos ] ) exhibit conspicuous clustering around @xmath60.80 ( 0.82@xmath50.06 ) and @xmath720(18@xmath57 ) .",
    "the very high mean value of the eccentricity could be attributed , in principle , to an observational bias : for this population , objects with the shortest perihelia ( and , therefore , the highest eccentricity ) should be the easiest to find .",
    "the moderately high average inclination is however surprising : objects with inclinations close to 0are nearly twice more likely to be found than those at 20yet none has been discovered ( 2010  vz@xmath8 has @xmath9=451 , see table [ etnos ] ) .",
    "this orbital behaviour does not fit easily within the well documented kozai dynamics beyond neptune ( gallardo , hugo & pais 2012 ) .",
    "the orbital distributions of the known etnos are unlike those of objects part of the trans - neptunian belt as characterised by e.g. fernndez ( 1980 ) .",

    "it was soon clear that its orbit was very unusual , travelling closer to the sun than any known planet , ( at that time ) asteroid or comet ( green et al . 1990 ) , and displaying higher than expected activity at aphelion ( sekanina 1990 ) . with an orbital period of 5.28 yr and a perihelion , @xmath15 , of just 0.12 au , its eccentricity , @xmath13 , is 0.96 , and its inclination , @xmath9 , is significant at 5831 .",

    "jenniskens et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and williams & collander - brown ( 1998 ) considered that the quadrantids do not originate from comet 96p / machholz 1 although it could be actively releasing meteoroids ( ohtsuka , nakano & yoshikawa 2003 ) .",
    "in fact , it could be the ancestor of the marsden and kracht groups of sunskirting comets ( sekanina & chodas 2005 ) .",

    "scenarios for the origin of this atypical object include being an interstellar comet , formation in the ourskirts of the oort cloud , or having a standard origin but being chemically altered due to its frequent excursions inside mercury s orbit ( see e.g. schleicher 2008 ) .",
    "levison & dones ( 2014 ) have shown that 96p / machholz 1 is trapped in a kozai resonance with jupiter in which its orbital eccentricity oscillates between 0.6 and almost 1.0 and its inclination varies between roughly 10and 80 ( see their fig .",
    "the value of @xmath1 for this comet is 1476 and when its eccentricity is close to 0.85 , the inclination is nearly 20(see fig . 31.2 in levison & dones 2014 ) .",

    "the time evolution of the osculating orbital elements of its nominal orbit is displayed in fig .",
    "[ comet ] .",
    "we confirm that the object is currently trapped in a kozai resonance with jupiter . because of this ,",
    "the eccentricity and inclination oscillate with the same frequency but out of phase ( see panels d and e ) , when the value of the eccentricity reaches its maximum the value of the inclination is the lowest and vice versa ( @xmath17 constant ) . in a kozai resonance , the apse and the node",
    "are in resonance with one another ( kozai 1962 ) .",
    "the values of eccentricity and inclination are coupled , and the value of the semimajor axis remains nearly constant ( see panels c , d and e in fig .",
    "[ comet ] ) .",
    "the orbit of this object is particularly chaotic and it is difficult to make reliable predictions beyond a few thousand years .",
    "all the integrated orbits give consistent results within the time interval ( -2 , 6.5 ) kyr .",
    "its current kozai resonant dynamical status is firmly established . as an example ,",
    "[ control96p ] displays the short - term dynamical evolution of an orbit arbitrarily close to the nominal one ( central panels ) and those of two illustrative worst orbits which are most different from the nominal one .",
    "the orbit labelled as ` -3@xmath11 ' ( left - hand panels ) has been obtained by subtracting thrice the uncertainty from the orbital parameters ( the six elements ) in table [ elements ] .",
    "it has the lowest values of @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath9 at the 3@xmath11 level .",
    "in contrast , the orbit labelled as ` + 3@xmath11 ' ( right - hand panels ) was computed by adding three times the value of the uncertainty to the orbital elements in table [ elements ] .",
    "this trajectory has the largest values of @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath9 ( within 3@xmath11 ) .",
    "close encounters with jupiter within the hill radius ( see panel a ) are very frequent with one of the nodes usually close to jupiter ( see panel g ) . with this orbital layout , the object is necessarily transient .",
    "we have neglected the role of non - gravitational forces in our simulations because the objective of this research is not the dynamics of the comet itself but its implications for the orbital evolution of other asteroidal bodies , neos and etnos .",
    "none of the control orbits computed here will drive the comet into the sun as predicted by levison & dones ( 2014 ) and others .",
    "the inclusion in the calculations of ( 10 ) hygiea , ( 31 ) euphrosyne , 704 interamnia ( 1910 ku ) and 511 davida ( 1903 lu ) has a major impact on the simulated evolution as the object becomes a transient , for about 1 kyr , co - orbital to some of them .",
    "relatively close encounters with all the previously mentioned asteroids are possible .",
    "perhaps , the most striking feature in figs [ comet ] and [ control96p ] ( e - panels ) is the dramatic flip from prograde to retrograde and back again observed after integrating the orbit at least 12 kyr into the future .",
    "the actual instant of the first orbital flip depends on the initial conditions but it is found in all the integrations .",
    "some retrograde episodes are short ( see fig . [ comet ] ) but longer events are possible ( see fig .",
    "[ control96p ] ) .",
    "these surprising events can be understood within the context of the eccentric kozai mechanism ( lithwick & naoz 2011 ) . in an attempt to explain the existence of counter - orbiting exoplanetary systems , li et al .",
    "( 2014 ) have demonstrated that for an initially coplanar hierarchical three - body system with both eccentric inner and outer orbits , the eccentricity of the inner orbit can be excited to high values and the orbit can flip by @xmath18180 , rolling over its major axis .",
    "the sudden orbit flip is the result of the comet continuously losing angular momentum that is in return gained by the outer perturber , jupiter in this case .",
    "when the comet s angular momentum is very small , a slight gravitational kick during a close encounter is enough to switch the direction of its orbit .",
    "the mechanism proposed by greenstreet et al .",
    "( 2012 ) to produce retrograde neos is different from the one presented here . in their simulations ,",
    "the role of the 3:1 mean motion resonance ( near @xmath12 = 2.5 au ) is central to make the orbits retrograde . in our case ,",
    "the 9:4 mean motion resonance with jupiter is the one at work when the flip takes place at aphelion ( see figs [ 94 ] and [ 94z ] ) . crossing the resonance triggers the orbital flip , see fig .",
    "it is , therefore , another evolutionary pathway to produce retrograde neos .",
    "the existence of multiple dynamical tracks running into the retrograde orbital domain can help to explain the detection of high - velocity , rocky meteoroids on retrograde orbits ( borovika et al .",

    "the main effect is in the evolution of the argument of perihelion which has a direct impact on the kozai mechanism .",
    "the inclusion of these relativistic effects in @xmath23-body simulations is customarily approached within the framework of the post - newtonian approximation ( see e.g. aarseth 2007 and references therein ) based on first - order expansion .",

    "( 2013 ) have found that the inclusion of post - newtonian contributions in the study of the kozai mechanism in hierarchical three - body systems can , in some cases , suppress eccentricity - inclination oscillations as the ones observed above when only newtonian terms are considered in the integrations .",

    "etnos can only be discovered at perihelion and if they follow an orbital evolution similar to that of comet 96p / machholz 1 , they will be preferentially found when their perihelion distance is the shortest ; therefore , their eccentricity is the highest possible which in turn implies that their @xmath1 must be close to 0at the time of discovery . perhaps , the secular evolution of these objects is better viewed in the @xmath24-plane , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are , respectively , the eccentricity and argument of perihelion of a given planet ( namouni 1999 ) . in fig .",

    "is driven by the fact that the value of the aphelion distance of this comet oscillates around that of jupiter ( see fig .",

    "in other words , for this mechanism to work , the aphelion of a massive perturber must be located relatively close to the aphelion distance of the affected object and this putative perturber should probably move in a low - eccentricity , low - inclination orbit ( see fig .",

    "it exhibits multiple properties that explain naturally the orbital distributions of these trans - plutonian objects .",
    "the incarnation of the kozai mechanism driving the evolution of comet 96p / machholz 1 and studied here opens a new and unexpected window into the trans - plutonian region that , if confirmed by the discovery of new members of the etno population exhibiting similar orbital features , can change our current views of the outermost solar system .",
