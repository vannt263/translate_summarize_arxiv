    "an interesting generalization of the boltzmann - gibbs entropy form has been recently proposed by tsallis @xcite , for a recent review see @xcite , for a full bibliography see @xcite .",
    "this new entropy , that we discuss below , posseses the usual properties of positivity , concavity and irreversibility and generalize the additivity in a non - extensive way . in the later years",
    ", a lot of work has been done in order to show either that many relationships involving energy and entropy in the usual scheme holds in the new one or in order to search for suitable generalizations for them .",
    "we should mention , among others , the work of curado and tsallis @xcite , that shows that the whole mathematical structure of thermodynamics legendre",
    "transform based becomes invariant under a change from extensive to non - extensive statistics ( nes ) .",
    "this , in fact , is a property recently proved to be valid for any entropic functional form @xcite , making then important to have a partition function within the formalism .",
    "boltzmann - gibbs thermostatics constitutes very complete and powerful techniques in situations whenever thermodynamics extensivity holds . but this formalism provide divergent partition , energy and entropy functions whenever the physical system includes long range forces or long memory effects . in this regard , the connection with quantum mechanics and with information theory has been stablished @xcite and further applications to self - gravitating objects @xcite and astrophysics @xcite , to lvy flights @xcite , turbulence of fluids @xcite and to the problem of solar neutrinos @xcite have also been studied . in general , systems which present a fractal like or unconventional structure in their space - time description or in their phase space evolution could develop hardly tractable mathematical problems within the standard formalism @xcite . very recently , grigera @xcite derived a molecular dynamic test for systems of long range interacting particles with potentials of the form @xmath1 .",
    "he found that the potential energy per particle do not converge for some cases of @xmath2 and sizes of the system , whereas non - extensive quantities do .",
    "also see refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "non - extensive thermostatistics was also used to study the cosmic blackbody radiation @xcite .",
    "this was the setting in which powerful bounds upon the non - extensive parameter were obtained .",
    "we shall review some of these results in our final section . a new analysis of nes blackbody cosmological radiation showed that , independently of the degree of non - extensivity , the temperature of the universe varies as the inverse of the scale factor of a flat friedmann - robertson - walker metric @xcite .",
    "this result suggested cosmology of the early universe as a very profitable arena for searching observational consequences of nes .",
    "as far as we know , the first of such studies were presented in @xcite , where a stringent bound on non - extensivity , of comparable order of magnitude as those obtained via the cosmic blackbody radiation , was derived .",
    "there , it was analized how a first order variation in the non - extensive parameter would affect the amount of primordial helium production , a quantity which can be compared with observational results , via a rather easy and straightforward approximate technique .",
    "we now turn to the issue of early universe cosmology and particularly , to the computation of primordial neutron to baryon ratio in the framework of nes .",
    "we shall also analyze cosmological situations of great importance , such as pair annihilation , temperature relationships , and comoving quantities .",
    "we thus refine the previous study and enhance it by a sharpening of the model .",
    "although we shall present a very brief review of the main formulae of nes ; in first approach , this work should be understood as the search of deviations from the standard model of the early universe provided by a different statistical description .",
    "what we want to use is a direct analytical computation of helium production , following the work of bernstein , brown and feimberg @xcite for the standard model , to allow for an approximate study .",
    "it is a matter of fact , that even when nucleosynthesis processes may be as complicated as one can afford , some simple assumptions makes results agree , within a typical few percent , with those generated by a numerical code , thus allowing for the isolation of the essential physics .",
    "that is exactly what it is needed here in order to study how , for instance , a different formula for the number of particles influence the evolution of the early universe and how can this be used to extract testeable predictions .",
    "nucleosynthesis has given a strong basis to do such a thing when alternatives theories of gravitation are concerned , see for instance @xcite , and also for particle physics @xcite and we hope to show , the same is applicable for alternative statistics .",
    "the rest of the work is organized as follows .",
    "firstly , some useful concepts and formulae of nes are presented .",
    "afterwards , the analytical computation of the neutron to baryon ratio is done , and finally we study the necessary approach to handle with neutron decay corrections . in the final section , we can use our previous results to estimate the mass fraction of primordial helium produced in the context of nes .",
    "although we shall not have at that moment every ingredient needed to do such a thing with great precision , the bound which we obtain hardly constrain the degree of non - extensivity in the very early universe and is already comparable with previous results .",
    "finally , we state our conclusions and mention other recently obtained related bounds .",
    "let us first recall some formulae of nonextensive statistic ( nes ) , in tsallis s approach .",
    "the formalism starts by postulating @xcite    * postulate 1*.- _ the entropy of a system that can be found with probability @xmath3 in any of @xmath4 different microstates @xmath5 is given by _    s_q = k _ i=1^w [ p_i - p_i^q]= k ( 1-_i=1^w p_i ^q ) , [ sq ] .",
    "we have a different statistics for every possible @xmath6value .",
    "in ( [ sq ] ) we have used , of course , that    _ i p_i = 1 . in general ,",
    "[ sq2 ] s_q = k .",
    "* postulate 2*.- _ an experimental measurement of an observable @xmath7 , whose expectation value in microstate @xmath5 is @xmath8 , yields the @xmath0- expectation value _ ( generalized expectation value ( gev ) )    [ gev ] < a>_q=_i=1^wp_i^q a_i = tr ^q a , @xmath7 .",
    "these two statements have the rank of _ axioms_. as such , their validity is to be decided exclusively by the conclusions to which they lead , and ultimately by comparison with experiment .",
    "the entropy given in ( [ sq ] ) is non - negative and reproduces the boltzmann - gibbs one ( @xmath9 ) in the limit @xmath10 .",
    "in fact , note that ( [ sq ] ) can be obtained from the boltzmann - gibbs expression by writing @xmath11 and then dropping the limit operator .",
    "it satisfies the pseudoadditivity property which states that if @xmath7 and @xmath12 are two independent systems ( @xmath13 ) then ,    = + + ( 1-q ) , which shows that @xmath14 is a measure of the degree of non - extensivity of the system .",
    "the optimization of @xmath15 given by ( [ sq2 ] ) together with the constraints @xmath16 and @xmath17 yield to the canonical ensemble equilibrium distribution @xcite ,    @xmath18^\\frac{1}{1-q},\\ ] ]    and to the generalized partition function ,    @xmath19^\\frac{1}{1-q}.\\ ] ]    here , as usual , @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the hamiltonian of the system .",
    "we shall focus in the @xmath22 limit , in which a first order expansion allows analytical computations .",
    "the expression of a general mean value of an operator was computed in this limit by tsallis , sa barreto and loh @xcite . when applied to particle number operators ,",
    "the result is :    @xmath23 \\right],\\ ] ]    where @xmath24 stands for @xmath25 ( @xmath26 is the energy of a simple particle ) and the symbol @xmath27 means _ to be computed in boltzmann - gibbs statistics_. with the standard values of @xmath28 and @xmath29 , for fermions and bosons , we obtain the main corrections ( the second terms in equation ( 8) ) , @xmath30 , as :    @xmath31    @xmath32    when @xmath24 is such that @xmath33 , then , @xmath34 ; while for @xmath24 big enough we get @xmath35 .",
    "we turn now our attention to the description of the model for the evolution of the neutron abundance as the universe evolves .",
    "as stated in the introduction , we shall follow the leading ideas of bernstein , brown and feimberg @xcite .",
    "we shall denote by @xmath36 the rate for the weak processes to convert protons into neutrons and by @xmath37 the rate for the reverse ones .",
    "@xmath38 will be , as usual , the number of neutrons to the total number of baryons .",
    "for it , a kinetic equation may be built ,    @xmath39    the solution to the previous equation reads :    @xmath40    with the integrating factor given by ,    @xmath41    where ,    @xmath42    note that the form of this solution does not depend on the statistical mechanics used .",
    "however , changing the statistical mechanics entails modifications in the rates , and this will make the solution differs from the standard .",
    "expression ( [ x2 ] ) is simplified by setting the initial value @xmath43 .",
    "we expect that @xmath44 and @xmath45 be very large at early times and high temperatures",
    ". then , the integration factor @xmath46 will be very small for times order @xmath47 and therefore the term @xmath48 can be omitted .",
    "besides , we also expect that due to the large interaction rates , the integral in the first term will be not sensitive to the change of @xmath49 by 0 . with this choice , we now have ,    @xmath50    finally , we may note that    @xmath51    and integrate by parts to obtain    @xmath52      to explicitly compute expression ( [ x4 ] ) , we need to know the functional form for the rates .",
    "let us first consider the rate @xmath53 .",
    "this is the sum of the rates of three individual processes ,    @xmath54    which are given by @xcite ,    @xmath55    @xmath56    @xmath57    where @xmath7 is an overall effective constant fixed by the experimental value of @xmath58 , @xmath59 stands for the magnitudes of the neutrino and electron momentum and @xmath60 for their energies .",
    "the recoil energy of the nucleons may be neglected , and this enable us to write the energy conservation equation @xmath61 for ( [ r1 ] ) and @xmath62 for ( [ r2 ] ) .",
    "these equations must be used in order to explicitly compute the integrals . in ( [ r3 ] ) , @xmath63 , with @xmath64 and this gives the upper limit in the integration range . finally , @xmath65 are distributions functions and @xmath66 are blocking pauli factors . in the usual scheme , @xmath65 are given by fermi distributions , whereas in our case , by the @xmath67 of the previous section .",
    "in general , the electron and neutrino temperatures , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , may differ because at the end of the freezing out period , electrons and positrons annihilate , heating only the photons and mantaining with them thermal equilibrium .",
    "the magnitude of this difference will be discussed below .",
    "as we shall see , this difference will be of a few percent during the period of consideration and our first approximations , following bernstein et .",
    "al . , is to set all temperatures equal , @xmath70 .",
    "when working in the boltzmann - gibbs framework this unique assumption ensure that the rates for reverse reactions , such as @xmath71 , obey the principle of detailed balance ( pdb ) , that we analize below in this general setting .",
    "let us consider , in the boltzmann - gibbs ( bg ) statistics and as an example , the reverse rate for ( [ r1 ] ) , that is ,    @xmath72    using energy conservation and the fact that @xmath73 we have , neglecting the recoil energy of the nucleon , @xmath74 , and thus :    @xmath75    as @xmath76 are fermi - dirac distributions , it is easily seen that @xmath77 and that @xmath78 .",
    "replacing this into ( [ reverse2 ] ) and recalling that @xmath79 , we get    @xmath80    which is the expression of the pdb .",
    "when nes is concerned , and correspondingly change from the fermi - dirac distributions to the @xmath81 ones , the pdb is no longer valid . in this framework",
    ", it may be seen that    @xmath82    where the correction is    = ( 1-n_e , bg ) c _ ( + ) - + n_,bg c_e ( + ) and the @xmath83 factors are as in ( [ correc - fer ] ) . in order to get a simplified picture , and following the bg case , we further approximate the model -exactly as was made in the standard case- by assuming that during the period of freezing , the temperature @xmath84 is low in comparison of the typical energies @xmath85 that contributes in the integrals for the rates .",
    "hence , we may replace the fermi - dirac distributions by boltzmann weights ( i.e. @xmath86 ) and consistently neglect the the pauli blockings ( i.e. @xmath87 ) . even in the case of nonextensive statistics ,",
    "pauli blockings corrections are @xmath88 , which are neglectable for @xmath89 and a first order deviation from @xmath90 .",
    "in addition , doing this allows for the analytical study that follows and which is the objective of the work . in this @xmath89 regime , the one which we are going to use thorough , we obtain @xmath91 , and we recover for the reverse rates the expression given in ( [ pdb ] ) of the pdb .      before we finally compute the integrals for the rates we neglect the electron mass in equations ( [ r1 ] ) and ( [ r2 ] ) in comparison to the energies @xmath60 . when this is made , the two rates become identical , exactly as they were in bg statistics .",
    "then we obtain :    @xmath92    where ,    @xmath93    concerning the rate of free decay of neutrons , we note that nes does not present any change within the context of previous approximations .",
    "that is due to the disappearence of all distributions functions from ( [ r3 ] ) . in that equation",
    "we can not neglect the mass of the electron and the standard result holds ,    @xmath94    this enable to eliminate @xmath7 in favor of the measured quantity @xmath95 ,    @xmath96    all along in this section , we shall neglect the free neutron decay rate when computing the total @xmath44 .",
    "thus , we have    @xmath97    finally , by using the variable @xmath98 , we get    @xmath99,\\ ] ]    for the neutron - proton rate and    @xmath100    for the reverse reaction .      in equation ( [ x4 ] ) ,",
    "we change now variables to the scaled temperature @xmath101 and obtain ,    @xmath102    the integrating factor now becomes ,    @xmath103    to evaluate the jacobian @xmath104 , we need to recall that the scale factor of the universe , @xmath105 , in a friedmann - robertson - walker metric , behaves as @xmath106 , independently of the statistics @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xmath107 , and the right hand side is given by einstein equations :    @xmath108    here @xmath109 is the energy density for relativistic particles in nes .",
    "this may be easily computed , if the distributions functions are known , by    @xmath110    where @xmath111 is the degeneracy factor .",
    "the result is    @xmath112    where @xmath113 . at high enough temperatures the energy density of the universe",
    "is essentially dominated by @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 s .",
    "interactions among these particles keep all them nearly the same temperature .",
    "accordingly , we set , @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 . with these values",

    ", it is shown the standard value of the neutron to baryon ratio and the correction due to nes . in fig .",
    "2 . are shown different explicit computations for a range of the @xmath0 parameter .",
    "finally , it may be seen that @xmath141 asymptotes to    @xmath142    for very low temperatures .",
    "we briefly assess here the possible dependence on the number of neutrino types . to do this we note that such a variation would introduce changes in the coefficients @xmath143 and @xmath144 quoted above .",
    "for three neutrino families , @xmath120 and the addition of one more family change it in an amount @xmath145 .",
    "then , the standard case coefficient @xmath143 is affected as ,    @xmath146    and the non - extensive related as ,    @xmath147    introducing these new values in ( [ kk ] ) and making all numerical computations again , it is possible to obtain the corrections due to a different number of neutrino families . in the sake of conciness",
    ", we shall explicitly skip these computations .",
    "instead we note that , while in the standard case , the addition of one more neutrino family would involve an increment of the energy density of the universe and a speed up in its expansion , in the general case , the correction will depend on the sign of the factor @xmath124 .",
    "we have already solved the evolution of the neutron abundance neglecting the neutron decay . as in the standard formalism , it is useful to change notation by using an overbar for the result just obtained , @xmath148 . including the effects of the free neutron decay in the rate equation we would get ,    @xmath149    because @xmath150 does not vary much during the period in which neutrons decay . in the capture time @xmath151 , when the temperature drops somewhat below the deuteron binding energy ( @xmath152 ) , the neutrons are captured in deuterons .",
    "then , deuterons collide and almost all neutrons present at @xmath151 are converted into @xmath153 . inserting this time in ( [ ult ] ) and using the asymptotic value of @xmath154",
    "just derived would yields , thus , half of the mass fraction of helium produced in the early universe . in order to obtain a precise value of @xmath151 or @xmath155 for the nonextensive result",
    ", we have to analize the set of the basic reactions :    [ reac4 ] n + p d + [ reac5 ] d+ d p + t [ reac6 ] t+ d ^4he + n. doing this in the standard case @xcite yields a value of @xmath156 such as the correction @xmath157 .",
    "although the analysis of ( [ reac4],[reac5],[reac6 ] ) in a nes framework is beyond the scope of the present work , we shall establish here the basis on which this could be done in the future .",
    "for this , we shall study the process of annihilation of pairs @xmath158 .",
    "we know that , when the temperature of the universe is low compared with the electron mass , electrons and positrons annihilate heating the photons and , morover , changing the effective quantity of degrees of freedom",
    ". then , one of the assumptions of the previous section , i.e. @xmath70 , is no longer valid and @xmath159 will be different from the decoupled neutrino temperature . we shall need the connection between these temperatures . to compute it ,",
    "we begin by noting that , at these times , the number of neutrinos in a comoving volume is fixed , independently of the statistics .",
    "effectively , after the moment in which the collision rate for neutrinos is lower than the expansion of the universe , @xmath160 , they can not be neither created nor destroyed . as the number of neutrinos is given by ,    n_(q)= _ 0^e^2 <",
    "n>_q = ( 3 ) g_t^3 + ( q-1 ) 5.50 t^3 the relationship ,    n_(t ) r(t)^3 = const . , or , equivalently ,    [ law ] t_(t ) r(t ) = const . , continues holding .",
    "> from the full set of einstein field equations , it may be established that    d((q ) r^3 ) = -p(q ) d(r^3 ) , this may also be written as ,    [ rel1 ] = ( r^3 ) .",
    "but we may compute @xmath161 , as was done with the energy density , obtaining @xmath162 for the relativistic gas . using this and ( [ rel1 ] )",
    ", we get    [ rel2 ] = 0 , as can be cheked by direct differentiation .",
    "this means , that in general case , @xmath163 is a conserved quantity in a comoving volume .",
    "when @xmath90 the previous expression stands for the entropy of the system .",
    "we may now consider that pair annihilation occurs at a temperature @xmath84 , and then indicate with symbols @xmath164 and @xmath165 , quantities before and after @xmath84 . from all above , we have    [ rel3 ] = . here",
    "@xmath166 is as in ( [ rho ] ) with the corresponding values of @xmath167 and @xmath168 . due to the removal of pairs ,",
    "we have that @xmath169",
    ". we may now expand ( [ rel3 ] ) , to first order in @xmath124 , obtaning the relationship ,    t_+^3 = t_-^3 ( ) , where ,    = ( 40.02 g_b,- + 34.70 g_f,- ) - ( 40.02 g_b,+ + 34.70 g_f,+ ) . until the moment of @xmath170 annihilation , the gas composed by @xmath170and @xmath117 follows a law of identical form that ( [ law ] ) , as such temperatures , being @xmath171 .",
    "but after the annihilation , where only @xmath172 remain , we have    [ rel4 ] t_= t _ ( ) ^13 , where the corresponding values @xmath173 and @xmath174 were used .      to finally compute the capture time @xmath156",
    ", we use that    = - ( ( q ) ) ^ 12 , from where    [ t ] t= _ t_^ ( ) ^ 12 follows .",
    "here @xmath175 adquires its low energy form    _ 0=+ , where @xmath176 and @xmath177 . recalling the relationship ( [ rel4 ] )",
    "we get , to first order in @xmath124 ,    _",
    "0=g_eff t_^4 + ( q-1 ) t_^4 14.84 where @xmath178 .    in the neighbourhood of the time of the neutron capture , an approximate evaluation of ( [ t ] ) is in order . using the expression for @xmath179 just derived , we get    t= ( ) ^12 ( 1+(1-q ) 1.74 ) + t_0 , where @xmath49 is an additional integration constant and the corrective number 1.74 arise from the first order evaluation of @xmath180 .",
    "recalling then the relationship between the temperatures , we may express    [ t2 ] t= ( ) ^12 ( 1+(1-q ) 1.76 ) + t_0 , we may neglect @xmath49 in a first approximation or obtain it from a perturbation analysis of ( [ t ] ) , @xcite .",
    "now , a comprehensive analysis of the reactions ( [ reac4],[reac5],[reac6 ] ) would yield a value for @xmath159 , for which almost all nucleons are converted into helium .",
    "using then ( [ t2 ] ) , the evaluation of @xmath156 follows and thus , the mass fraction of primordial helium . in passing through nes , we have to note that a fundamental tool in this analysis , i.e. saha formulae , is modified in a non - trivial way .",
    "this entails modifications in the abundance fractions that may in turn change their ratios , which are the magnitudes on which the set depends .",
    "so , although phenomenological fits for the rates may be considered , we acknowledge here that further research must be done to analytically solve for the reactions , in the case this be ultimately possible . this analysis is far out from the present work and we shall not discuss this problem in deeper detail .",
    "we have presented a comprehensive study of the primordial neutron - baryon ratio in the context of non - extensive statistics .",
    "this work , thus , extends previous advances on the helium nucleosynthesis production problem @xcite and is the result of a detailed analysis of the weak interaction rate and the energy densities corrections at first order in the non - extensive parameter @xmath124 .",
    "we have also studied some important cosmological scenarios such as the possible existence of conserved comoving quantities , temperatures relationships and pair annihilation , together with pointing out where further research is needed .",
    "these other results will be used elsewhere to put new stringent bounds on the non - extensivity of the universe by using high precision satellite cosmological measurements of the cosmic microwave background and new galaxy surveys .    even without getting a precise analytical value for the helium synthesis , it is possible to obtain a first insight in the problem by considering it as exactly twice of the neutron - baryon asymptotic value , weighted by the free neutron decay :    y_p^theoretical ~2 x(t ) where @xmath181 is given by equation ( 56 ) .",
    "but as mentioned above , in order to put an exact bound we would need the value of @xmath155 .",
    "however , even considering that @xmath159 is the same as in the standard formalism ( @xmath182 ) we could use ( [ t2 ] ) to get the correction in @xmath156 . using afterwards the first order expansion of ( [ ult ] ) ( which contains equation ( 53 ) ) we would get the stringent bound :    [ bou ] |1-q| < 2.6 10 ^ -4 . in order to get this bound ,",
    "we have imposed that the non - extensive corrections ( coming from equations ( 75 ) and ( 53 ) and the theoretical value of @xmath183 as explained above ) be less than the observational error in the primordial helium production , which is doubled so as to neglect the difference between the central values of the analytical and observational magnitudes @xcite , i.e. :    y_p^observational=0.23 0.02 .",
    "this abundance is a very safe estimate of the primordial helium production , which in fact is a very complex observable magnitude , see for instance the recent review by schramm and turner @xcite for details .",
    "besides , it encodes other possible uncertainties such as the value of the cosmological constant or the exact number of neutrino species .    the bound ( [ bou ] )",
    "is comparable with that already obtained in ref . @xcite .",
    "although it should be recalled that such derivation was different from this and the method followed skip the uncertainties of the neutron capture time here analyzed .",
    "in addition , the weak interaction rates were only approximately treated in @xcite while here they were studied in full detail .    in a recent letter @xcite",
    ", it was suggested that the universe as a whole could behave with a non - extensive parameter roughly equal to 0.54 .",
    "such a value seems to be too high as to resist early universe tests as the one presented here .",
    "therefore , this bound , obtained in the simplest situation so as to admit an analytical solution , pertains to those imposed in the context of early cosmological models , and from this point of view , enlarge the problems that non - extensivity would have as a correct description of the physical universe thorough all eras of cosmic evolution . very recently",
    ", other works have also been devoted to study possible deviation from the boltzmann - gibbs statistics in cosmological and other situations . among them , and apart from ref .",
    "@xcite already commented , we should note the following ones :    * plastino , plastino and vucetich @xcite studied the value of the stefan - boltzmann constant in the new framework .",
    "a comparison with the experimental value leads to @xmath184 .",
    "they also used data from the firas experiment on the cobe satellite concening the microwave background radiation , from there they obtain @xmath185 . * tsallis , sa barreto and loh @xcite also generalized the planck radiation law and used satellite data from cobe to constrain the non - extensive parameter .",

    "<S> we study the primordial neutron to baryon ratio in a cosmological expanding background within the context of non - extensive statistics , in a fully analytical approach . </S>",
    "<S> first order corrections to the weak interaction rates and energy densities in the early universe are obtained and their consequences on the helium synthesis are analized . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , if the nucleosynthesis scenario should be in agreement with observation , this entails a very restrictive bound upon @xmath0 , the non - extensive parameter . </S>",
    "<S> we also study some cosmological interesting situations such as the moment of pair annihilation , conserved comoving quantities and derive for the nonextensive statistics , temperature relationships , before and after the removal of pairs .    _ </S>",
