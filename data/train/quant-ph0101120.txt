    "these lecture notes were written for the american mathematical society ( ams ) short course on quantum computation held 17 - 18 january 2000 in conjunction with the annual meeting of the ams in washington , dc in january 2000 .",
    "the objective of this lecture is to discuss quantum entanglement from the perspective of the theory of lie groups .",
    "more specifically , the ultimate objective of this paper is to quantify quantum entanglement in terms of lie group invariants , and to make this material accessible to a larger audience than is currently the case .",
    "these notes depend extensively on the material presented in lecture i @xcite .",
    "it is assumed that the reader is familiar with the material on density operators and quantum entanglement given in the ams  short course lecture i , i.e. , with sections 5 and 7 of @xcite .     of necessity , the scope of this paper",
    "is eventually restricted to the study of qubit quantum systems , and to a specific problem called the _ restricted fundamental problem in quantum entanglement _ ( _ rfpqe _ ) .",
    "references to the broader scope of quantum entanglement are given toward the end of the paper .",
    "+ figure 1 .  quantum entanglement lab ? ? ?    at first sight , a physics research lab dedicated to the pursuit of quantum entanglement might look something like the drawing found in figure 1 , i.e. , like an indecipherable , incoherent jumble of wires , fiber optic cable , lasers , bean splitters , lenses .  perhaps some large magnets for nmr equipment , or some supercooling equipment for rf squids are tossed in for good measure .  whatever .. it is indeed a most impressive collection of adult `` toys . ''",
    "however , to a mathematician , such a lab appears very much like a well orchestrated collection of intriguing mathematical `` toys , ''  just beckoning with new tantalizing mathematical challenges .       in the hope of piquing your curiosity to read on , we give the following brief preview of what is to come :    the rfpqe reduces to the mathematical problem of determining the orbits of the big adjoint action of the group of local unitary transformations @xmath0 on the lie algebra @xmath1 of the unitary group @xmath2 , as expressed by the following formula : @xmath3 where `` @xmath4 '' denotes the big adjoint operator , and where the remaining symbols are defined in the table below .",

    "one false move , and everything explodes into a dense jungle and clutter of technicalities .  we leave it to the reader to determine how successful this endeavor is .      finally , we close this introduction with a brief historical perspective .    over the past twentieth century , the scientific community s view of quantum entanglement has dramatically changed .  it continues to do so even today .",
    "initially , quantum entanglement was viewed as an unnecessary and unwanted wart on quantum mechanics .",
    "einstein , podolsky , and rosen@xcite tried to surgically remove it .",
    "bell@xcite,@xcite showed that such surgery can not be performed without destroying the very life of physical reality .    today",
    ", quantum entanglement is viewed as a useful resource within quantum mechanics .",
    "it is now viewed as a commodity to be utilized and traded , much as would be a commodity on the stock exchange .",
    "quantum entanglement appears to be one of the physical phenomena at the central core of quantum computation .",
    "many believe that it is quantum entanglement that somehow enables us to harness the vast parallelism of quantum superposition .",
    "but what is quantum entanglement ?    how do we measure , quantify , classify quantum entanglement ?  when is the quantum entanglement of two quantum systems the same ? different ?  when is the quantum entanglement of one quantum system greater than that of another ?",
    "it is anticipated that answers to the above questions will have a profound impact on the development of quantum computation .  finding answers to these questions",
    "is challenging , intriguing , and indeed very habit forming .",
    "our tangled tale of quantum entanglement begins with alice and bob s first encounter with quantum entanglement .",
    "alice and bob , who happen to be good friends ( as attested , time and time again , by the open literature on quantum computation ) , meet one day .  a discussion ensues .",
    "the topic , of course , is quantum entanglement .  fortunately or unfortunately , depending on how one looks at it , their discussion explodes into a heated argument .  after a lengthy debate , they agree that the only way to resolve their conflict is to purchase the real mccoy , i.e. , a pair of entangled qubits .",
