    "most low - mass stars have a deep convective envelope . understanding its dynamical properties",
    "is of fundamental interest to explain the evolution and redistribution of heat , energy and angular momentum transport in stars .",
    "it is also a key step towards a global comprehension of the generation and organisation of magnetic fields within these stars .",
    "little is known about the spectral energy distribution as a function of depth within stellar convective zones .",
    "for instance , is there a clear separation between different spatial scales in convective patterns or can they genuily manifest themselves at the stellar surface ? unfortunately , the sun is the only star where we can observe with enough spatial resolution the multi - scales properties of surface convection going from granulation with 1 - 2 mm diameter cells and typical lifetime of 5 minutes to possible giant cells of few 100 mm with lifetime of several weeks passing through supergranulation cells of 20 - 50 mm diameter with lifetime of the order of a day ( norlund , stein & asplund 2009 , rieutord & rincon 2010 ) .",
    "the origin of such a large range of spatio - temporal scales and the physical processes behind these distinctive scales including possibly also mesogranulation has been debated for decades .",
    "simon & weiss ( 1968 ) have proposed the location of h , he and metals recombination layers to explain the granules , supergranules and giant cells existence .",
    "rast ( 2003 ) has proposed an advection / fragmentation process in the upper layers of the convective zone to explain the mesogranulation and supergranulation from an initial random distribution of downflow plumes . however , a turbulent origin for these convective patterns is much convincing nowadays . whereas granulation and supergranulation have clear evidence of existence via respectively g - band or white light intensity observations and time averaged dopplergrams over 30 minutes or magnetograms , the intermediate mesogranulation is still controversial .",
    "rieutord et al . ( 2000 ) stresses the spatial and time filtering biases in the correlation tracking techniques ( see meunier et al .",
    "2006 for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "as far as the giant cells are concerned , they initially have been predicted by simon & weiss ( 1968 ) as an efficient way of transporting heat over several density scale height thanks to the lower superadiabatic temperature gradient necessary for convection over such larger scales .",
    "but they are very difficult to measure since they are on the one hand merged within stronger signals like granulation or supergranulation which have to be removed correctly and on the other hand , looking for such a large scale signal imply to substract both the global differential rotation of the sun and the limb effect and to disentangle possible line shifts due to the solar magnetic field in active regions .",
    "evidence for an underlying organisation of the convective flows have been advocated by lisle et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , who found a north - south alignment of supergranulation patterns possibly due to the presence of giant cells .",
    "spectroscopic studies ( labonte et al . 1981 , scherrer et al . 1986 ) found cells with a longitudinal extension around 45@xmath1and a typical velocity lower than 10 m / s but the use of magnetically sensitive fei line could tune down these conclusions .",
    "giant cells might also have been detected indirectly in velocity spectra from soho / mdi time averaged data by hathaway et al .",
    "( 2000 ) with a significant power at low spherical harmonics degrees ( @xmath2 ) and a proper rotation rate similar to the sun .",
    "another approach consists at developping full sphere simulations resolving only the largest scales of turbulent convection down to supergranulation with mean flows .",
    "they can be used as a tool to probe these giant cells and useful to develop specific proxies to help their observational detection .",
    "much local cartesian simulations including a higher turbulent degree and also radiation processes are able to probe the properties of granulation ( stein & nordlund 1998 , vogler 2005 ) . from the simulations and the observational data ,",
    "there is a recent trend to bring together the different scales of convection contrary to the previous paradigm which identified specific discrete scales for granulation , mesogranulation and supergranulation as different features of convection .",
    "this is well highlighted by looking at the velocity spectrum @xmath3 increasing linearly with the wave number k over this broad range of spatial scales presented in the nordlung , stein & asplung ( 2009 ) review on figure 22 .",
    "in the perspective of future work dedicated to low mass young stars presenting much deeper convective zones than the sun and thus possibly more extended giant cells , we try to quantify their own identity in our simulations , if their properties depend on the size of the convective zone and how they might modify the dynamics of convection by advecting smaller scale motions",
    ". actually , as the local density scale height diminishes much less towards surface in low mass pre - main sequence stars than within the sun , we can expect lower horizontal expansion rate of giant cells near the surface .",
    "this could imply a potential larger lifetime due to their weaker distortions by the mean flows .",
    "indeed , these giant cells should also be important in the global stellar activity cycle , particularly to transport magnetic flux from the bottom of the convective zone up to the stellar surface .",
    "finally , it is also important to notice that the equatorial modes associated to the linear growth of the convection instability and discussed by busse & cuong ( 1977 ) and gilman ( 1975 ) could be candidates for these giant cells if they survive in the non linear regime when turbulence is fully developed .    in this paper , we present a set of high resolution 3d simulations of a subpart of the whole convective zone for a low - mass young star assuming various radial density contrasts .",
    "the initial 3d stellar models implemented in our simulations are presented in section 2 with the numerical methods and boundary conditions used to compute them .",
    "next , the wavelet analysis pipeline developed specifically for this study is detailed in section 3 with the main methods used to probe the existence of stellar giant cells and their characteristics as the main goal of this paper",
    ". then , we present our results showing the properties of convection in the different models in section 4 , hunt for giant cells and their global properties in section 5 and conclude in section 6 .",
    "four different models with an e - folding radial density contrast from 13 to 272 are computed .",
    "the different main characteristics of the four models computed are presented in table [ sim_prop ] and discussed in section 4 .",
    "typical run for these simulations lasts 3000 days , i.e. several convective overturning time .",
    "the outer boundary condition is common to all models and is located at 0.98@xmath4 below the stellar surface to keep the anelastic treatment of the ash code correct .",
    "the inner boundary location for each model is determined to have the chosen density contrast .",
    "we restrict here to very slow rotators equal to the mean solar rotation rate .",
    "however , common low mass yso such as ctts have mean stellar angular velocity as high as 5 @xmath5 and have been already studied by ballot et al ( 2007 ) .",
    "other spectral type of yso have been studied by brown et al .",
    "( 2008 , 2010 ) .",
    "the simulations described here were performed with the anelastic spherical harmonic ( ash ) code .",
    "ash solves the three - dimensional anelastic equations of motion in a rotating spherical geometry using a pseudospectral semi - implicit approach ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these equations are fully nonlinear in velocity variables and linearized in thermodynamic variables with respect to a spherically symmetric mean state .",

    "the effects of compressibility on the convection are taken into account by means of the anelastic approximation , which filters out sound waves that would otherwise severely limit the time steps allowed by the simulation .    for boundary conditions at the top and bottom of the domain",

    "stress free conditions : @xmath32 3 .   and constant entropy gradient : @xmath33    convection in stellar environments occurs over a large range of scales .",
    "numerical simulations can not , with present computing technology , consider all these scales simultaneously .",
    "we therefore seek to resolve the largest scales of the nonlinear flows since we are interested in the global transport of heat , energy and angular momentum in convective envelopes and particularly to the existence of giant cells .",
    "we do so within a large - eddy simulation ( les ) formulation , which explicitly follows larger scale flows while employing subgrid - scale ( sgs ) descriptions for the effects of the unresolved motions . here , those unresolved motions are treated as enhancements to the viscosity and thermal diffusivity ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) , which are thus effective eddy viscosities and diffusivities . for simplicity , we have taken these to be functions of radius alone , and to scale as the inverse of the square root of the mean density . however , the deepest model @xmath34 only depends on the inverse of the cubic root of the mean density to avoid to increase too much the horizontal resolution in order to fully resolve the convective patterns near the base of the convective zone .",
    "we emphasize that currently tractable simulations are still many orders of magnitude away in parameter space from the highly turbulent conditions likely to be found in real stellar convection zones .",
    "these large - eddy simulations should therefore be viewed only as indicators of the properties of the real flows .      to solve numerically with ash the anelastic equations of motion we use a pseudo spectral method ( glatzmaier 1984 , canuto 1995 , fornberg 1999 ) .",
    "the velocity and thermodynamic variables within ash are expanded in spherical harmonics @xmath35 in the horizontal directions and in chebyshev polynomials @xmath36 in the radial direction .",

    "such stars are fully convective until they reach @xmath46 myr .",
    "we choose the initial condition for our models just after the appearance of the radiative core at 4 myr . at this time",
    ", the stellar radius is @xmath47 , the base of the convection zone is at @xmath48 and the stellar luminosity is @xmath49 .",
    "moreover , the mass stratification within the star is really different from the sun since 87 % ( vs 2.8 % ) of the mass is localized within the convective zone and the central density is only 3.29 @xmath50 ( vs 160 @xmath50 ) .",
    "this is also stressed by the small variation of the local density scale height as function of depth with very different domain aspect ratio for the different density contrast considered ( see figure [ hrho ] ) .",
    "the radiative transport is really weak and reaches a maximum of @xmath51 at @xmath52 ( see figure [ lum ] ) .",

    "these luminosities are normalized with respect to the stellar luminosity .",
    "the different inner boundaries for the convection zone of our set of simulations correspond to the vertical dashed lines.,width=219 ]    the main source of energy in these young stars is the energy release from the gravitational contraction . in cesam , this source term is written as @xmath56 where t is the local temperature within the star and c is the constant of contraction characterizing the quasi - static state of the star ( see iben 1965 for more details ) .",
    "a typical value for c is c=0.02 which gives an initial central temperature for the stellar core of @xmath57k . after an evolution of 1 myr on the pms phase ,",
    "the initial guess for c is not so important since the relative difference on the surface stellar luminosity and the position of the base of the convection zone is only 2% for an initial value more than two order of magnitudes smaller .",
    "this energy source term is much less localized than in main sequence stars where the nuclear reactions are mainly confined within the deep central region translating into a source term depending on a high power of temperature ( vs a power of one in our study ) . here",
    ", the coefficient of proportionality c in @xmath22 is adjusted such that we obtain the stellar luminosity at the surface after integration of the energy source term over radius . in order to have consistent models for each density contrast case , the luminosity at the inner boundary needs to match the 1d stellar luminosity curve . from figure [ lum ]",
    ", we deduce the luminosity imposed at the inner edge .",
    "for instance , the models for cases @xmath58 and @xmath59 will have an inner luminosity of @xmath60 and @xmath61 respectively . as a direct consequence ,",
    "a diffusive flux must be imposed in order to carry the flux that would have otherwise been transported by convection within the unsolved central region ( see figure [ flux_bal ] ) .",
    "the radial component of this diffusive flux is then chosen to have a swift decrease within the part of the convective zone studied to let the resolved convection operate self - consistently .",
    "since the simulations that we perform correspond to spherical shells and that large scale structures are looked for , embedded among complex patches of convection especially near the surface , the use of a wavelet decomposition adapted to this spherical geometry is a powerful tool for detecting giant cells .",
    "the healpix pavement of the sphere into equally area blocks at different resolution with a dyadic description of the different levels is useful for developing efficient wavelet decomposition algorithms and fast statistical analysis for high resolution maps on the full - sphere . from our binary output containing different shell slices ,",
    "conversion into fits format is done using the @xmath62 routine allowing direct representation of our data in the ring format for healpix where data is organized for each iso - latitude circle from the north pole to the south one . before applying this transformation , an overbinning by a factor 2",
    "is applied to fit to the nine level of resolution of the healpix maps .",
    "this corresponds to the parameter nside=@xmath63=512 and do not modify the initial horizontal resolution of our simulations which is typically 1024@xmath642048 .",
    "next , the multi - resolution ( mrs ) package developed at cea ( starck et al . 2006 ) is used to perform wavelet analysis .",
    "the undecimated isotropic wavelet transform is used for its efficiency since the sum of all the wavelet scales and the coarsest resolution image provides exactly the original image .",
    "the analyzing wavelet @xmath65 for each spatial scale n is defined by the difference between two order three box - spline @xmath66 ( whose shape is very similar to a gaussian ) with consecutive cutoff frequencies having a dyadic distribution and starting from the nyquist frequency defined by @xmath67 for the first scale : @xmath68 .",
    "the interested reader can find all the details of such a wavelet transform in starck et al .",
    "wavelet coefficients for each scale highlight different features in the convective patterns , the finest scale detailing the complex downflows structures whereas the coarsest one allowing the detection of large scale flows .    for each simulation output file and",
    "each chosen depth in the convection zone , the wavelet analysis is performed for seven scales and for each variable studied .",
    "an illustration of this wavelet decomposition is presented in figure [ wt_decompos ] showing the analysis of the radial velocity for the shell slice near the stellar surface at @xmath69 for the model @xmath58 . at the top left hand side ,",
    "the complex convective patterns of such a high resolution simulation is highlighted with asymmetries between fine dowflows and broader upflows .",
    "the first two scales correspond to fine structures in the downflow plumes .",
    "the scale 3 focuses on the downflows network whereas large scale structures are stressed in scales 6 and 7 .",
    "the scales 4 and 5 correspond to intermediate scale structures linked to broader upflows of convective cells .",
    "finally , the last scale shows the large scale structures which could correspond to giant convective shells .",
    "various methods are used to detect the signal corresponding to the largest scales of convection in our attempt to hunt for giant cells .",
    "first , we analyze the strength of the radial velocity variable at large scale by calculating the ratio between the rms speed at scale 3 and the rms speed at scale 7 and by distinguishing both the upflows and downflows .",
    "next , we perform a time correlation analysis both on the complete image and on scale 7 in order to quantify the lifetime of the detected large scale structures . to do this",
    ", we analyse a 60 day long time series of longitude - latitude maps of the radial velocity i.e. about two stellar periods for each model .",
    "then , we calculate the autocorrelation function ( acf in the following ) as defined below and already used in miesch et al .",
    "( 2008 ) for each lag time @xmath70 with respect to the initial snapshot :    @xmath71    @xmath72 where the convective patterns are reprojected in the new reference frame @xmath73 corotating with the chosen tracking velocity @xmath74 .",
    "the optimal tracking velocity @xmath75 partly due to the stellar differential rotation is defined for each latitudinal range [ @xmath76,@xmath77 among a large range of values @xmath74 at depth r in order to maximize the acf function .",
    "then , we define the typical lifetime of large scale structures as the time @xmath78 where the acf function is bigger than a defined threshold ( typically 0.5 for this study ) for each band of latitude .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      using our wavelet analysis pipeline , we can see how these giant cells transport enthalpy , kinetic energy and angular momentum with respect to smaller scales .",
    "figure [ transport_sc7 ] shows such an analysis for the specific radial enthalpy , radial kinetic energy and angular momentum fluxes transported both by the entire flows and only by the largest scales in the @xmath79 model .",
    "we focus here at one depth corresponding to @xmath80 to have a better contrast since for instance the radial specific enthalpy flux tends towards zero near the surface due to the chosen unpenetrable boundary conditions .",
    "the different quantities are computed taking into account only the fluctuating components as defined in brun & palacios(2009 ) .",
    "first , we find that the enthalpy transport by giant cells is always directed outwards at scale 7 .",
    "this represents about 3% of the total enthalpy flux whereas strong negative enthalpy flux are found at the edges of convective cells at smaller scales .",
    "strong negative kinetic energy fluxes are localized in the fine structures of the downflows between the convective cells whereas positive kinetic energy fluxes correspond to upflows in the full image . at scale 7",
    ", there is a good correlation between the giant cells signal at low latitudes detected via the radial velocity field and the kinetic energy fluxes , i.e. that the negative kinetic energy flux is located in the downflows of the giant cells .",
    "the amplitude of the signal at scale 7 corresponds to 2% of the signal in the full image .",
    "the specific angular momentum flux due to the @xmath81 component of the reynolds stress is involved in the latitudinal tranport of angular momentum ( see brun & toomre 2002 for details ) . whereas this transport is complex at small scales , the scale 7 shows a dominant transport equatorwards at low - latitudes but also an important transport polewards particularly in the south hemisphere at mid - latitudes .",
    "the transport by scale 7 represents 5% of the total signal .",
    "finally , the third column of figure [ transport_sc7 ] shows the reconstruction of the variables without the giant cells signal ( i.e. we have substracted the signal corresponding to scale 7 ) .",
    "this points out the importance of large scale structures to transport enthalpy outwards particularly since the snapshot without this signal leads to a clear lack of transport of enthalpy outwards .",
    "the difference is less obvious for the other quantities , but as we have already seen these large scales contribute for few percents to the overall transport .    hence we find that these large scale convection structures contribute to the global distribution of heat , energy and angular momentum in a systematic way , imposing a large scale trend to the smaller scale flow .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the general properties of multi - scale convection within deep stellar convective zones .",
    "first , the convection spatial structure near the stellar surface is well constrained by the local density scale height which is a consequence of the conservation of mass in a statified media . however , this convection organization at small scales depends also on the thickness of the shell to some extent as shown in polar regions for the case @xmath82 that possesses the thinnest shell . still , the global statification has negligible influence on this surface convective patterns whenever the thickness of the convective zone is sufficient ( @xmath83 mm in our study done with @xmath84 mm at the surface ) .    by using a wavelet analysis ,",
    "we have stressed that there is a clear signal at large scale ( @xmath85 mm ) with a typical radial velocity around 2 m / s which is much more elongated in latitude when the density contrast increases ( see figure [ lat_tau ] ) .",
    "this `` latitudinal extent '' estimate of the giant cells can be a means to determine the depth of the convection zone via correlation tracking .",
    "this could also be an interesting observational method to try preferentially to detect these giant cells at large latitudes .",
    "these large structures have a proper tracking rate really greater than the local differential rotation and the discrepancy increases with the density contrast .",
    "it is important to understand that the giant cells detected here , even they have several characteristics similar to the linear convection equatorial modes , are clearly different in nature . gilman ( 1975 ) shows that these equatorial modes are the most unstable in the linear regime for high m modes ( @xmath8620 ) when the taylor number increases ( @xmath87 ) for a quite thin convective zone ( @xmath88 ) but with a decrease in the most unstable m mode for thicker convective zones as studied in glatzmaier & gilman ( 1981 ) .",
    "however , the longitudinal extent of our giant cells is really similar for all models despite the great range of taylor numbers covered in these simulations .",
    "gilman ( 1975 ) also shows that these equatorial modes are well confined at low latitudes ( @xmath89@xmath1 ) which is not the case for our high density contrast models .",
    "these giant cells are also different from the basic convective rolls since they are not extended over the full depth of the convective zone particularly up to mid latitudes for the much realistic high density contrast cases with a really turbulent flow as shown in figure [ conv_t_patterns ] .",
    "we thus believe that the signal seen at large scale is genuine and instructive to reveal observationally stellar giant cells . as in lisle et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , we find that giant cells are predominantly oriented along the north - south direction .",
    "more recently , hanasoge et al . (",
    "2010 ) have looked for the existence of giant cells using a time distance analysis of numerical simulations of the solar convection with the ash code . after a calibration of mdi solar surface observations from these simulations ,",
    "they obtain an upper limit for the longitudinal velocities around 10 m / s for @xmath90 corresponding to the range of spatial scales identified in our simulations . in figure 12",
    ", we have found a maximal radial velocity for the giant cell signal of 12.9 m / s .",
    "a wavelet analysis on @xmath91 and @xmath92 gives respectively maximal velocities of 11 m / s and 7 m / s consistent with the error bars of hanasoge et al .",
    "( 2010 ) as reported on their figure 5 . however , the direct comparison of their results with ours is not so straigthforward since we model a young star with a density stratification and velocity profiles that differ from the sun .",
    "on the other hand , it is likely that simulations done with the ash code possess a different energy spectra in the large scales with respect to reality since the range of scales available spans only of the order of 3 decades .",
    "this could lead to an over estimation of the amplitude of the giant cell signal even if our simulations clearly show evidence of their existence .",
    "the lifetime for these giant cells is much greater than the stellar rotation rate .",
    "these giant cells take part in a systematic way to the transport of heat , energy and angular momentum although their contribution do not exceed a few percent of the transport carried out by the whole range of flows .",
    "there are actually two types of giant cells in the deepest convective zones corresponding to @xmath93 models and separated roughly by the tangent cylinder .",
    "the giant cells localized at low latitudes do not span the entire convection zone due to the strong low latitude radial shear in these models and we find mainly two of them in the radial direction ( i.e. around 110 mm in thickness ) contrary to the giant cells at higher latitudes which are aligned with the rotation axis and coherent trough the whole thickness of the convective zone .",
    "this two different modes of convection , with very different aspect ratio for the convective cells , can be understood by the different orientation of gravity and coriolis force with respect to the flow combined with the increase influence of rotation in these deep convective zones .",
    "we have thus found that giant cells are likely to be present in deep convective zones with aspect ratio of 4 - 5 and that they are more easily detected at mid - latitudes .",
    "the presence of giant cell flows in our purely hydrodynamic simulations suggest that some large scale organisation of the stellar turbulent convection is possible . in the presence of magnetic field these large scale ordering of the flow",
    "may contribute to the global scale dynamo observe in most solar - type stars .",
    "we intend to study in the near future ( bessolaz & brun , in preparation ) the subtle interplay between multi - scale convection , rotation and magnetic field in young solar type stars that possess deep convection zone and possibly giant cells .",
