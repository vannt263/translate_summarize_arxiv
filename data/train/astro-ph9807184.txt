    "it has been shown by ( hereafter snw95 ) that microlensing of stars can produce a distinctive and significant polarisation signature , even for lensed stars with no net unamplified polarisation . in this contribution",
    ", we use the model developed in snw95 to simulate a series of realistic observations of microlensing events .",
    "we use these simulations to examine how much additional information about the parameters of the lensing event can be determined from polarisation measurements .",
    "normally , the light received from stars is unpolarised unless the star has some suitable asymmetry ( eg an asymmetric wind or radial distortion ) .",
    "however , the emission from the limb of the star can be expected to be quite strongly polarised .",
    "therefore , during a microlensing event , different parts of the limb may be amplified by different amounts , breaking the symmetry of the star and giving rise to an observable net polarisation .",
    "this effect will be most significant if the stellar radius is comparable to or larger than the einstein radius of the lens projected onto the plane of the lensed star .",
    "the observed polarisation will reach a maximum as the line of sight to the lens crosses the limb of the star .",
    "this gives rise to the distinctive polarisation profiles of lensing events given in snw95 , with a polarisation peak coincident with the amplification peak if the line of sight to the lens remains outside the stellar disk , but a double - peaked polarisation profile if the lens appears to cross the disk of the star ( `` transit '' events ) .",
    "clearly , when studying an actual lensing event , one would use a model appropriate to the observed stellar type .",
    "also , one would hope to be able to obtain information about the lensed star itself , as well as the parameters of the lensing event .",
    "however , here we will only consider the lensing parameters themselves and so we consider a simple `` generic '' stellar atmosphere model .",
    "the full details of the models we use for the stellar atmosphere and microlensing event are given in snw95 .",

    "as shown in snw95 , when the source radius @xmath1 is very much less than the projected distance between the star and the lens ( the impact parameter @xmath2 ) , the star is effectively a point source and there is no measurable polarisation .",
    "however , when @xmath3 , significant polarisation can occur , and the flux amplification is modified from that expected for the point - source approximation .",
    "using this model , we have simulated photometric and polarimetric observations of microlensing events with realistic sampling and errors .",
    "two such simulations are given here ( selected at random from our `` catalogue '' ) .",
    "both simulations are for a v=17 star in the lmc lensed by a 0.01 m@xmath4 lens at half the distance to the lmc with a velocity on the plane of the sky of 50 km / s .",
    "the impact parameter in both cases is 0.1 angular einstein radii .",
    "observations are taken once `` nightly '' .",
    "photometric errors are based on and polarimetric errors are calculated for a 2-hour exposure in v on a 1.2 m telescope . the first simulation is for an @xmath5 source ( figure  [ fig : r100+r10 ] , left - a transit ) and the second for @xmath6 ( figure  [ fig : r100+r10 ] , right ) .",

    "we have shown that microlensing can produce a significant , distinctive polarisation signature and that observations of these signatures can provide considerable additional information about the parameters of a lensing event .",
    "in particular , some of the degeneracy between the various parameters of the lensing event present in purely photometric observations can be broken .",
    "the realistic simulated observations presented here demonstrate that such observations can be obtained with modest resources . in a future paper ( newsam et al , in preparation ) we will present a thorough exploration of the lensing parameter - space with more realistic stellar atmosphere models both to determine when polarisation measurements would be most useful , and to examine the use of such measurements to study the atmosphere of the _ lensed _ star .",
