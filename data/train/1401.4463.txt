    "in 2004 wu derived a general expression for the two - point resistance of a resistor network in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the associated laplacian matrix @xcite . in practice , however , this approach is sometimes difficult to carry through due to the singular nature of the laplacian . in ref .",
