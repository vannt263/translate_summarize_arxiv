    "core - collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) are the explosive end of massive stars with @xmath4 .",
    "there is a diversity in the spectroscopic and photometric properties of ccsne which are mainly related to the ability of the progenitor to retain its outermost layers .",
    "type ii sne , with clear h lines in their spectra , represents the case where a thick h envelope is kept before the explosion .",
    "type ib sne , with no h lines but with clear he lines , have lost their h envelope but not the he layers .",
    "finally type ic sne , with no h and he lines in the spectra , represent a more extreme case where not only the the h but also the he envelopes are likely lost before the explosion .",
    "there are also transitional objects between these different types .",
    "one example is that of type iib sne , which show h lines at early times but then the spectrum is transformed into that of typical sne  ib .",
    "type iib , ib and ic objects are collectively called striped - envelope sne @xcite .",
    "progenitor models of sne  iib comprising a helium star surrounded by a very thin hydrogen - rich envelope ( of @xmath5 ) have been successful to explain the observed light curves ( lc ) and spectral features @xcite . however , it is not clear which is the mechanism responsible for the removal of the outer envelope before the explosion .",
    "one possibility is strong winds that occur in massive stars with @xmath6 .",
    "alternatively , in close binary systems ( cbs ) stars are expected to exchange mass providing an efficient mechanism to allow for the removal of outer layers .",
    "currently , the binary channel is favored particularly for the case of sne  iib .",
    "additional support for the binary scenario in sne  iib comes from the detection of a hot companion for the famous sn  iib 1993j  @xcite .",
    "this was initially suggested by pre - explosion photometry @xcite .",
    "the lc and evolutionary models of sn  1993j were also in favor of the binary channel @xcite .",
    "some evidence for a companion was also reported for another sn  iib 2001ig @xcite .",
    "the type iib sn  2011dh was recently discovered in the nearby galaxy m51 attracting the attention of many observers because of its proximity and brightness .",
    "it was discovered almost immediately after explosion @xcite .",
    "it showed early radio and x - ray emission @xcite . using pre - explosion images obtained from the hst archive @xcite and @xcite detected a source at the location of sn  2011dh .",
    "they derived similar values of luminosity and effective temperature for pre - sn source .",
    "the object was consistent with a yellow supergiant ( ysg ) star with a radius @xmath7 and without any clear evidence of a companion star contributing to the observed spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .    at present",
    "there is a controversy in the literature as to whether the ysg is the actual progenitor of sn  2011dh .",
    "some authors have suggested that the exploding star should be more compact @xcite based on ( 1 ) a simple comparison between the early light curve ( lc ) of sn  2011dh and sn  1993j ; ( 2 ) a discrepancy between the temperature derived from an early - time spectrum and that predicted by an analytic expressions for an extended progenitor ; and ( 3 ) the large shock velocity derived from radio observations .",
    "recently , we have performed a detailed hydrodynamical modeling of sn  2011dh using stellar evolutionary progenitors @xcite .",
    "these models indicate that observations are compatible with a helium star progenitor of a mass near @xmath8  @xmath0 surrounded by a thin hydrogen - rich envelope ( @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath0 ) with a radius of @xmath11 ( similar to that of the detected ysg star ) that underwent an explosion with an energy of @xmath12  erg that synthesized @xmath13  @xmath0 of @xmath14ni .",
    "such large radius values are needed to reproduce the early light curve of sn  2011dh without contradicting the temperatures derived from the spectra .",
    "in addition , our hydrodynamical modeling rules out progenitors with he core masses larger than 8  @xmath0 , which corresponds to @xmath6 .",
    "it is very difficult for a single star to reach these pre - sn conditions .",
    "the existence of a strong wind capable of removing most of the envelope requires a massive star of @xmath9 25 @xmath0 or more , which is in contradiction with the lc models .",
    "moreover , in order to retain a thin hydrogen - rich layer , the mass loss rate would have to be on a very narrow interval .",
    "these facts strongly suggests that the progenitor of sn  2011dh should be a component of a binary system .    however , a recent work by proposed that single ysg stars such as the one detected at the location of sn  2011dh are plausible sn progenitors .",
    "this is based on stellar evolution calculations of stars with main sequence masses of 1215 @xmath0 under the assumption of an increased mass - loss rate several times above the standard values .",
    "however , no physical explanation is given for such an increase .",
    "also note that a recent paper by found a good agreement between modern determinations of mass - loss for rsgs and the standard mass - loss prescription .",
    "although , other mass - loss formulation as proposed by point towards higher mass - loss rates but this prescription seems to be applicable only to dusty stars and gives a overestimates of the mass - loss rates for galactic rsgs .",
    "the aim of this work is to show the plausibility that the progenitor of sn  2011dh was part of a close binary system ( cbs ) with properties compatible with the pre - sn observations and the results of lc modeling .",
    "the observational properties of the remaining companion star are discussed in anticipation of future detections .",
    "although we do not perform a complete exploration of the parameter space ( stellar masses , initial orbital period , and mass - transfer efficiency @xmath3 ) , we show that our results are robust if we consider moderate changes of the initial conditions .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : code ] we present a brief description of our binary stellar evolution code paying special attention to the characteristics that enabled us to compute pre - sn models . in section  [ sec : results ] we present the main results of this paper regarding the adopted binary configuration (   [ subsec : configuration ] ) , evolutionary calculations (   [ subsec : evolu ] ) as well as the spectra of the components at the moment of the explosion (   [ subsec : sed ] ) . in section  [ sec :",
    "disc ] we present a discussion of our results and finally , in section  [ sec : conclu ] we provide some concluding remarks .",
    "in order to compute the evolution of the cbss quoted above we shall employ a code similar to that described in  @xcite , adapted for the case of massive stars .",
    "briefly , this is a henyey code that when the star reaches roche lobe over flow ( hereafter rlof ) conditions it solves implicitly not only the whole structure of the donor star but also the mass transfer rate ( hereafter mtr )  @xmath15 in a simultaneous , fully implicit way .",
    "such a procedure has been found to largely improve numerical stability as compared to algorithms that compute the mtr explicitly  , enabling us to reach pre - sn condition meanwhile the donor star is losing mass at an appreciable rate with a detailed , continuous and convergent sequence of stellar models . in detached conditions ,",
    "the code works as a standard henyey scheme .    in",
    "order to adapt the code to the case of massive stars we have incorporated several nuclear reactions from the compilation of  @xcite and rewritten the difference equations to largely improve numerical stability . also , we incorporated semiconvection following the diffusive approach presented in   and first applied to massive stars by  .",
    "this formulation of diffusive semiconvection depends on an efficiency parameter @xmath16 for which we assumed @xmath17 as in  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we shall ignore the effects due to overshooting and rotation .    in semidetached conditions we compute  @xmath15 following the prescription given by     @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the radius of the donor star ; @xmath20 ,",
    "the radius of a sphere with a volume equal to the corresponding roche lobe is computed following  @xcite ; @xmath21 is a smooth function of @xmath22 and @xmath23 whereas @xmath24 ( where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the radial coordinate and pressure respectively ) is the photospheric pressure scale height . for further details",
    "see  . in detached conditions we consider stellar wind following  . as we shall discuss in",
    "[ sec : results ] , we consider different accretion efficiencies , @xmath3 , of the material transferred by the donor to the secondary , i.e. @xmath27 , and evolve the orbit as described in  @xcite .    after computing the evolution of the donor star , we evolve the companion star taking into account the accretion rate it receives from the donor as described in  @xcite .",
    "we do not consider mass loss from the accreting star .",
    "as we ignore any effect of the secondary star on the donor one other than imposing a limit on its volume , this is an usual assumption in this type of problems .",
    "it is well known that in cbss like those we are interested in here , the material accreted by the secondary star may have a mean molecular weight higher than the corresponding to its outer layers .",
    "this may lead to an unstable situation that induces the so  -  called thermohaline mixing  . in the present version of our code we have not included thermohaline mixing yet . in any case",
    ", it is worth to remark that @xcite have shown that ignoring thermohaline mixing has a minor effect on the evolutionary track of secondary stars of cbss similar to those studied here .",
    "therefore , we expect that the main conclusions of this work not to be affected by neglecting this phenomenon .",
    "the broad - band hst pre - explosion photometry of the sn  2011dh @xcite and the light curve modeling  @xcite impose strong constraints about our election of the binary parameters , mass of the primary , of the secondary and the initial period . here",
    "we briefly discuss the motivations of our election of these parameters before we present our results .",
    "if the object detected in the pre - explosion image is indeed the progenitor of sn  2011dh and it belongs to a binary system , the primary ( donor ) star needs to have a luminosity ( @xmath28 ) compatible with the value derived by @xcite and @xcite for the progenitor candidate , i.e. @xmath29 .",
    "this luminosity is an indication of the he core mass at the moment of the explosion which in turn is related with the mass of the star on the main sequence ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "@xcite derived @xmath31 comparing the luminosity with the end points of the evolutionary tracks of single stars .",
    "note that they did not use the color information of the progenitor to derive this mass because uncertainties are expected in the color due to unknown mass - loss history .",
    "meanwhile @xcite derived @xmath32 using both @xmath28 and the effective temperature ( @xmath33 ) derived from colors and choosing the track that best matched these values , although this point does not correspond with the final position of the single star at the end of the evolution .",
    "in addition ,  @xcite derived a helium core of @xmath34 from the light curve modeling of sn  2011dh and firmly ruled out progenitors with @xmath35 25 @xmath0 .",
    "here we adopt an initial mass of @xmath36 for the donor star that is well within the ranges provided in previous studies .",
    "after assuming a mass value for the donor star , we still have to consider the mass of the secondary star as well the orbital period of the binary .",
    "our choice should be guided by the fact that pre - explosion observations indicate that the observed portion of the spectrum is compatible with a single source .",
    "obviously , the secondary has to be less massive than the donor star but we have to distinguish between two cases : i ) the mass ratio is close to one and ii ) the mass ratio appreciably differs from one .    let us consider the case i ) : if the masses of the stars differ in ( say ) few tents of solar mass , the secondary star would be able to exhaust core hydrogen before explosion .",
    "this object would receive material coming from the donor star when it is on the hertzsprung gap where the shell nuclear burning around the core takes place .",
    "calculations available in the literature as well as our own test ( see   [ sec : disc ] ) indicate that , after accretion , such object appears as an overluminous b supergiant with a @xmath33 in between that of the observed ysg and that of the zams ( see , e.g. , fig . 5 of claeys , et al . 2011 and",
    "our fig .",
    "[ fig : explora_qmasa ] ) . in this case",
    "some evidence of the secondary should have been detected in the hst pre - explosion photometry as in the case of sn  1993j .",
    "case ii ) results more natural .",
    "if the secondary star has a mass appreciably lower than that of the donor , it will be still undergoing core hydrogen burning at the moment of the explosion of the primary star .",
    "therefore , at the moment of the explosion and in the hrd , we expect the secondary to be close to the zams",
    ". the object will remain hot and will emit most of the flux in the uv .",
    "as it is well known the more massive the object the greater its luminosity on the zams and therefore the greater its effect on the pre - explosion photometry .",
    "thus , the mass value chosen for the secondary star should be low enough to have remained almost undetected .",
    "note , however , that if the mass of the secondary is much lower than 10 @xmath0 , the kelvin - helmholtz timescale increases appreciably and it is very likely that the system reaches common envelope conditions .",
    "therefore , we adopt a mass of 10 @xmath0 for the secondary .    even with a mass of 10 @xmath0 if the secondary object were able to undergo a conservative mass transfer and the primary star ends its evolution with a mass of @xmath37 as required by lc modeling , the secondary would end its evolution with @xmath38 on the zams .",
    "this would produce a very bright object that may not be compatible with the pre - sn observations .",
    "one possibility that we will explore in the next section is that the secondary captures a fraction @xmath3 of the material transferred , therefore its final mass will be of @xmath39 . note that the accretion efficiency , @xmath3 , is one of the most uncertain parameters in binary stellar evolution .",
    "another parameter usually employed in the treatment of orbital evolution in binaries is the specific angular momentum @xmath40 of the material lost by the system in units of the angular momentum of the primary star .",
    "we shall assume @xmath41 throughout this paper .    regarding the initial period ,",
    "this has been evaluated in order for the pre - sn donor star to fall inside the error box given by the @xmath28 and @xmath33 estimated for the progenitor candidate of sn  2011dh .",
    "suppose that the donor star is losing mass by rlof at the moment of the explosion , i.e. that the the size of the roche lobe is approximately equal to the radius of the donor star .",
    "this radius can be determined using @xmath42 and @xmath43 @xcite leading to values of @xmath44 270 @xmath45 .",
    "if the initial masses are 16 + 10 @xmath0 and the final masses are 4 + 12 @xmath0 , the final orbital semiaxis is @xmath46 and the final period at the moment of the explosion can be estimated to be @xmath9 800 days .",
    "finally , the initial period can be calculated using eqs .",
    "6 - 8 of @xcite which relates the initial and final orbital semiaxes as a function of the initial and final masses of the system .",
    "this leads to initial periods of @xmath9 120 days .",
    "note that if the luminosity is due to the internal structure of the star , then at pre - sn conditions a given orbital period will correspond to a given effective temperature : the larger the period the lower the effective temperature .",
    "in the next section we analyze in detail a system with an initial period of 125 days consistent with this first approximation .",
    "other values are discussed in section  [ sec : conclu ] .      in the previous section we discussed our election of the binary parameters adopted to study a possible progenitor for sn  2011dh . here",
    "we present our results for a cbs of solar - composition stars with masses of 16  @xmath0  +  10  @xmath0 on a circular orbit with an initial period of 125  days . as stated in  ",
    "[ subsec : configuration ] , we analyzed different values of the mass - transfer efficiency , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 .",
    "we computed the evolution of both stars starting with zams models up to core oxygen exhaustion .",
    "the main results of these calculations are presented in figures  [ fig : evolu_beta_00 ] to [ fig : todo_perfilh ] .",
    "notice that the evolutionary tracks corresponding specifically to the cases @xmath49 and 0.75 are provided only in the electronic edition .     and 10  @xmath0 on an orbit with an initial period of 125  days assuming fully non  -  conservative mass transfer ( @xmath50 ) .",

    "dots along it indicate the mass of the star during the rlofs .",

    "the star ends its evolution with a mass of 4.034  @xmath0 with an effective temperature and luminosity compatible with the data observed for the object at the position of the supernova sn2011dh .",
    "meanwhile the donor star evolves from the zams to pre - sn conditions , the companion star suffers a much slower evolution . its evolutionary track is depicted with a solid blue line and ends with a dot representing the conditions attained at the moment of the explosion of the primary . for comparison ,",

    "this is the main rlof because the donor star detaches from its lobe when has only 4.54  @xmath0 .",

    "the secondary star is found to be significantly hotter than the donor star .",
    "indeed , for high enough effective temperatures , the effect of the secondary would only be appreciable in the bluest available photometric band .",
    "we thus study here the effect of the secondary on the sed of the system for different values of @xmath3 , and compare this with the hst pre - explosion photometry . to calculate the sed for each star of the binary system as well as the composed sed we used atmospheric models for solar composition provided by @xcite .",
    "the model spectrum of each star was obtained by linearly interpolating at the values of @xmath33 and surface gravity ( @xmath80 ) given in tables  [ tabla : donora ] and [ tabla : secundaria ] .",

    "observed fluxes were obtained from the tabulated magnitudes given by @xcite and zero points in the vega system calculated using the alpha lyrae sed provided by @xcite .",
    "note that the contribution of the secondary star is significant only for the bluest observed band , f336w .",
    "the increase in the f336w flux due to the presence of the secondary is of 16% , 22% , 32% , 45% , and 62% for the cases of @xmath84 0.00 , 0.25 , 0.50 , 0.75 , and 1.00 respectively .    for the rest of the observed hst bands the contribution of the secondary",
    "is @xmath85 6% , i.e. for wavelengths @xmath86  4000  the spectra is completely dominated by the light coming from the donor , pre - sn star . in this wavelength",
    "range the available observations on four photometric bands pose no constraint on the properties of the accreting star . on the contrary , the bluest filter , with a maximum transmittance at @xmath87  3400",
    " partially detects the red tail of the spectrum of the accreting star .    for the filters with transmittance at @xmath86  4000",
    "the agreement between calculations and observations is very good , especially considering that we have not adjusted any parameter . for the case of the bluest filter ,",
    "f336w , the contribution of the secondary to the total flux is not negligible .",
    "if we consider the measurement uncertainty in this band we find that the secondary is detectable only at the 2-@xmath88 level in the most extreme case ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "the contribution is further decreased to the @xmath90-@xmath88 level when completely non - conservative mass accretion ( @xmath68 ) is considered .    remarkably , irrespective of the value of @xmath3 , at the moment of the explosion , the secondary star is so hot that its light has been barely detected .",
    "thus , quite unfortunately , the characteristics of the secondary star are very poorly constrained by the presently available data .",
    "in the previous section we have shown that a properly chosen binary configuration can explain very well the proposed ysg progenitor of sn  2011dh .",
    "our models also predict that the total and hydrogen masses of the donor star at the moment of the explosion are consistent with the results of lc modeling and the sn iib classification .",
    "a complete exploration of the parameter space of initial stellar masses and orbital periods is not the scope of this paper .",
    "nevertheless , we briefly test that our results are robust if we consider moderate changes of the initial parameters .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ fig : explora_peri ] shows the sensitivity of the evolutionary track of the primary star on small variations of the initial period , @xmath91 between 100 and 200 days , for the same configuration presented in the previous section , i.e. 16 + 10 @xmath0 , and @xmath92 . within such range of initial periods",
    "the donor star ends its evolution as a ysg close to the region of the hrd allowed by the pre - sn photometry . the evolutionary track of the secondary is not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : explora_peri ] because it is not sensitive to the initial period in the range under study .",

    "the larger the initial period the lower the effective temperature attained by the pre - sn . for @xmath93",
    "d we find the pre - sn object inside the error box allowed by photometry previous to the explosion without need of any fine tuning .",
    "[ fig : explora_peri ] ]    , @xmath72 and different values for the initial mass of the companion .",
    "labels a and d stand for accretor and donor stars respectively . for simplicity , we computed the evolution of the donor with the 15  @xmath0 companion and assumed it to be the same for the other companion masses . for this donor initial mass value ,",
    "secondary stars with masses up to @xmath9  15.25  @xmath0 fall close to the zams at the moment of the explosion of the donor star and most of its light will be emitted on the blue part of the spectrum . however , if the secondary star has an initial mass of 15.50  @xmath0 , at the supernova event it will have at much lower effective temperature .",
    "this is not compatible with the available observations of the progenitor of sn  2011dh .",
    "[ fig : explora_qmasa ] ]    the effect of changes in the mass of the secondary star on the binary evolution is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : explora_qmasa ] .",
    "three values were considered , @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 @xmath0 . in all the cases , we assumed a value of @xmath92 and a mass of the primary star of 16 @xmath0 as in our previous models .",
    "the initial period was modified to make the end - point of the donor star match the region allowed by the pre - sn photometry . following the criteria described in section  [ subsec : configuration ] ,",
    "the adopted initial period for this test was of 50 days . from the figure ,",
    "it is clear that only for the case of @xmath97 , where the mass ratio is closest to one , the secondary star moves appreciably away from the zams at the moment of the explosion of the primary .",
    "this is because the secondary has exhausted its hydrogen core before the beginning of the first rlof .",
    "consequently , the secondary ends with a redder color than that of lower - mass stars and it is expected to contribute significantly to the observed pre - sn photometry .",
    "indeed , the flux of the secondary in the bluest observed band , f336w , is @xmath98 times larger than that of the primary star , which would lead to a @xmath99 detection . for the rest of the hst bands the contribution of the secondary",
    "is within 630@xmath100 . while not compatible with the case of sn  2011dh , this configuration may be applicable to sn  1993j whose pre - sn observations showed evidence of a companion star @xcite .",
    "secondary stars of slightly lower initial masses ( @xmath101 and @xmath95 @xmath0 ) remain near the zams and end as hot stars of similar luminosity to the primary",
    ". stars of masses between 10 and 15 will also remain as blue objects near the zams .",
    "because of the high effective temperature most of the flux from the secondary is emitted in the uv , away from the bandpasses of the pre - explosion imaging . however , if the luminosity is high enough , the secondary may produce a detectable effect in the optical range .",
    "for instance , with masses of @xmath101 and @xmath95 @xmath0 , the flux of the secondary in the f336w band would be comparable to that of the primary star . the level of detection of the secondary in these cases would be close to @xmath102 .",
    "the final luminosity of the secondary also depends on the assumed value of @xmath3 .",
    "lower initial masses could result in similarly high luminosities with values of @xmath3 close to unity .",
    "unfortunately , it is not possible to break such degeneracy based solely on the available pre - explosion photometry .",
    "future observations of the possible secondary star after the sn fades from sight can shed light on this matter .",
    "the initial mass of 16 @xmath0 for the primary star leads to a progenitor with the right characteristics as derived from pre - explosion photometry , lc modeling and spectral classification .",
    "therefore , our choice of initial masses and orbital period is by no means unique but it allows to prove that a cbs is a plausible progenitor for sn  2011dh and other sne  iib .",
    "moreover , the right progenitor properties are achieved in a self - consistent manner and independently of the detailed initial conditions .    in the past few years",
    ", some progenitors of sne  ii have been associated with ysg stars , e.g. type iip sn  2008cn @xcite , type iil sn  2009kr @xcite , and the sn studied here .",
    "the explosion of a ysg is not compatible with the theoretical prediction of single stellar evolution .",
    "motivated by this apparent discrepancy and the lack of evidence of a companion for sn  2011dh , studied the effect of an increased mass - loss rate on the final properties of stars with initial masses of 12 - 15 @xmath0 . assuming rates several times higher than the standard values , they found that it was possible to explain the explosion of single stars of relatively low mass in the yellow area of the hrd .",
    "in particular , the proposed scenario could explain the progenitor of sn  2011dh .",
    "however , no physical explanation was given for such an increased mass - loss process .",
    "note that the evolutionary tracks of isolated stars are strongly dependent upon the details of mass loss . in this sense , explaining the position of the progenitor of sn  2011dh in the hrd would require some degree of fine tuning .",
    "the binary scenario instead provides a self - consistent picture that naturally explains why the star remains as ysg for long periods of time and until the explosion . in the case of cbs evolution",
    "we find that , irrespective of the mass transfer efficiency , the donor star undergoes a final rlof before igniting carbon and so it is still transferring mass to the companion at the moment of explosion . during the final rlof",
    ", the donor star transfers a small amount of material .",
    "so , the orbit and its roche lobe enlarge very little meanwhile the donor star tends to swell as a consequence of nuclear shell burning .",
    "this precludes the donor star to attain lower effective temperatures and makes it evolve to higher luminosities in a way equivalent to the evolution of giant stars with extended outer convective zones . in any case",
    ", the observed effective temperature of the proposed progenitor of sn  2011dh strongly indicates the initial orbital period , but no other parameter has to be adjusted for the pre - sn object to fall inside the observational error box .",
    "the ysg nature of the progenitor is thus a direct consequence of close binary evolution .",
    "recently @xcite suggested a division of sne  iib into compact ( ciib ; @xmath103 cm ) and extended ( eiib ; @xmath104 cm ) subtypes essentially based on radio lc properties .",
    "compact objects were proposed to have smaller hydrogen masses , roughly below @xmath10 @xmath0 . used this criterion and their own cbs evolutionary code to analyze the range of periods ( for @xmath105 days ) and initial masses needed to produce extended sne  iib .",
    "however , our calculations show that it is possible to have an extended progenitor ( @xmath106 ) with a h mass of @xmath107 @xmath0 . therefore ,",
    "if the ciib and eiib subtypes correspond to physically distinct progenitors , the division criterion may need to be revised .",
    "in addition , @xcite also analyzed the space of parameters in cbss to produce type ib / ic sne using very different initial periods of @xmath108 8 days , as compared with the ones adopted here .",
    "they found that some of their models predict a thin hydrogen layer of @xmath109 @xmath0 with a compact structure .",
    "this channel of production of sne  iib is different from the one we have presented and leads to explosions far away from the ysg regime .",
    "with the aim of providing a description of the progenitor of sn  2011dh , we have studied the evolution of close binary systems of solar composition stars with masses of 16  @xmath0  +  10  @xmath0 .",
    "we considered an initial period of 125  days and different efficiencies ( @xmath3 ) of the mass transfer process .",
    "we followed the simultaneous evolution of the donor and accreting stars from the zero age main sequence up to the oxygen core exhaustion of the donor .",
    "we found that the donor star , independently of @xmath3 , ends its evolution with effective temperature and luminosity consistent with the ysg object detected in the hst pre - sn photometry .",
    "the exploding star has a mass @xmath110  4@xmath0 , a radius @xmath111  250@xmath45 and an outermost layer containing @xmath112  @xmath0 of hydrogen .",
    "this is generally consistent with the type iib classification and the results of lc modeling of sn  2011dh by @xcite .",
    "these results are a natural consequence of the close binary evolution and require no external adjustment of any physical condition .",
    "regarding the accretion efficiency , @xmath3 , we found that ( 1 ) the evolution of the donor star is almost independent of @xmath3 while the secondary strongly depends on it , and ( 2 ) the evolution of the orbital period , the mtr and the total hydrogen content are almost independent of the value of @xmath3 .",
    "our calculations indicate that the donor star is lossing mass at the moment of the explosion with rates that differ markedly from constant .",
    "inferences on the mass of the donor star at the time of the explosion should take into account the appropriate mass loss in this phase . we also found some indication that the total hydrogen content may be a function of the initial orbital period with larger period producing a larger the hydrogen content .",
    "a more detailed study of this point is left for future work .",
    "we analyzed the effect of the secondary star on the observed hst pre - explosion photometry .",
    "for all the values of @xmath3 , at the moment of the explosion of the donor , the secondary star is still near the zams .",
    "this is a direct consequence of our assumption that the object has a mass appreciably lower than that of the donor .",
    "the effective temperature of the companion is far higher than that of the donor with values within of 22 to 40 thousand kelvin .",
    "thus , the largest contribution to the flux of the system from the secondary is in the bluest observed band , f336w , producing a marginal detection of 0.62@xmath88 level depending of the value of @xmath3 .",
    "unfortunately , the available hst pre - sn observations are not very suitable to constrain the properties of the secondary .",
    "the ultimate proof of the binary nature of sn  2011dh must come from the possible detection of a very hot star once the sn light fades enough .",
    "this situation would be similar to what occurred with sn  1993j but with different properties of the companion . in any case , we should remark that detecting the companion star of sn  2011dh would provide valuable information on the efficiency of the mass transfer process and evolution of massive cbss in general .",
