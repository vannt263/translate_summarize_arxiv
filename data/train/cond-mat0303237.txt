    "there is a strong evidence of the multigap nature of superconducting state in the recently discovered @xcite compound mgb@xmath0 .",
    "the concept of multiband superconductivity was introduced in @xcite for the case of large disparity of the electron - phonon interaction for the different fermi - surface sheets . for mgb@xmath0 ,",
    "first - principles calculations of the electronic structure and the electron - phonon interaction @xcite have revealed two distinct groups of bands , namely strongly superconducting quasi - two - dimensional @xmath4-bands and weakly superconducting three - dimensional @xmath5-bands . quantitative predictions for various thermodynamic and transport properties of mgb@xmath0 were made in the framework of the two - band model .",
    "@xcite    a large number of experimental data , in particular tunneling , @xcite point contact measurements,@xcite and heat capacity measurements,@xcite directly support the concept of a double gap mgb@xmath0 .",
    "intraband impurity scattering in both bands may vary in large limits , while interband scattering is always weak due to the disparity of @xmath4- and @xmath5-band wave functions.@xcite this explains the extremely weak suppression of @xmath2 by impurities and the weak correlation between @xmath2 and the resistivity .",
    "therefore , a unique feature of the mgb@xmath0 is that the two - gap nature of superconductivity persists even in the dirty limit for the intraband scattering rates .",
    "superconductivity in the two bands is characterized by different energy and length scales which show up in several properties of a superconductor .",
    "particularly interesting are the properties of the mixed state .",
    "the c - axis abrikosov vortex structure in mgb@xmath0 was studied by stm in ref .  , which probes mainly the weakly superconducting @xmath5-band .",
    "a large vortex core size compared to estimates based on @xmath1 and the rapid suppression of the apparent tunneling gap by small magnetic fields has been reported .",
    "these observations can be naturally explained within the two - band model.@xcite    one of the most spectacular consequences of the two - band superconductivity is the unusual behavior of anisotropy factors for different physical parameters.@xcite it was demonstrated that in clean mgb@xmath6 samples the anisotropy of the london penetration depth,@xcite @xmath7 , has to be very different from the anisotropy of the upper critical field,@xcite @xmath8 .",
    "both anisotropy factors should strongly depend on temperature and have opposite temperature dependencies : @xmath7 is expected to increase and @xmath8 is expected to decrease with temperature .",
    "strong temperature dependence of @xmath8 has been reliably confirmed by experiment.@xcite typically , @xmath8 drops from 5 - 6 at low temperatures down to @xmath9 2 near @xmath3 .    in this paper",
    "we consider in detail the behavior of the upper critical field for different field orientations for the case of a _ dirty _ two - band superconductor with weak interband scattering .",
    "the model is based on the multiband generalization of the quasiclassical usadel equations.@xcite the same model has been used recently to describe vortex core structure in mgb@xmath6.@xcite the general equations for determination of the upper critical field within this model have been derived in recent paper .",
    "however , calculations in this paper have been done only for the case of small band anisotropies . in this paper",
    "we address the case of very high anisotropy in the quasi-2d band , more suitable for mgb@xmath0 .",
    "we demonstrate that the strong temperature dependence of the @xmath1-anisotropy exists also in the dirty case and therefore represents a general property of a two - band superconductor .",
    "the main reason for this dependence is the strong reduction of the in - plane upper critical field by the weak @xmath5-band in the very narrow temperature region near @xmath3 .",
    "this also leads to the significant upward curvature of the temperature dependence of the in - plane upper critical field near @xmath3 .",
    "this behavior illustrates breakdown of the anisotropic ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory for description of this superconductor .",
    "we demonstrate that , due to the large difference between microscopic coherence lengths in the c - direction for the two bands , the anisotropic gl theory is applicable only within the extremely narrow temperature range near @xmath3 .",
    "we analyze the angular dependence of the upper critical field and show that it strongly deviates from the standard `` effective - mass '' dependence predicted by the anisotropic gl theory .",
    "contrary to naive expectations , these deviations are strongest for temperatures quite close to @xmath3 ( at @xmath10 ) and vanish only for temperatures extremely close to @xmath3 ( for @xmath11 ) . in the past the angular dependence of the upper critical field have been studied in ref . for a clean two - band superconductor .",
    "it was shown that for the case of two weakly deformed spherical fermi surfaces with opposite anisotropies the angular dependence also strongly deviates from the `` effective - mass '' law .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : model ] we present usadel equations for a two - band superconductor and introduce parameters relevant for mgb@xmath6 . in section [ sec",
    ": c - axis ] we derive equation for the upper critical field in the c - direction and obtain the exact asymptotics at small and high temperatures . in section [ sec : a - axis ] we consider the in - plane upper critical field .",
    "we derive general equations for determination of this field and study solutions of these equations in different regimes .",
    "we demonstrate that the gl result for the in - plane @xmath1 is valid only within a very narrow range of temperatures .",
    "we also numerically calculate in - plane @xmath1 and the anisotropy parameter @xmath8 in the whole temperature range . in section [ sec : tilted ] we study the angular dependence of the upper critical field and analyze quantitatively the deviations from the effective - mass law .",

    "are performed .",
    "the results demonstrate the deviation from the effective - mass dependence .",
    "this means the breakdown of anisotropic gl theory .",
    "further , we have shown that the temperature range of applicability of the gl theory is extremely narrow in the considered two - band case .",
    "another issue is strong coupling corrections to @xmath1 . in this paper",
    "the weak coupling approach was used . on the other hand ,",
    "it is known from work on isotropic superconductors @xcite that strong coupling corrections renormalize the absolute value of @xmath1 by the factor @xmath249 , where @xmath250 is the coupling constant and @xmath251 . since electron - phonon coupling in mgb@xmath0 is relatively strong ( according to ref .  ,",
    "@xmath252 ) , these corrections are important for calculation of absolute values of @xmath1",
    ". however , we do not expect qualitative changes in the temperature and angle dependencies of the anisotropy ratio calculated in the present paper .",
    "extension of our results to the strong coupling eliashberg regime is an interesting subject for future work .",
