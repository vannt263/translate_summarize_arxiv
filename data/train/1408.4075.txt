    "<S> this may be the case at central rapidities , especially at the lhc . in the cgc framework , quark pair production in this dense - dense regime can not be computed analytically but may be feasible numerically . </S>",

    "<S> however , ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : pt ] ) , we are able to describe the phenix data on the @xmath2 dependence at forward rapidity . the small discrepancy with phenix data at central rapidities may reflect the fact that our formalism is most reliable for large c.m energy or for forward rapidities . as stated previously , our computation is the first that includes contributions from both the color singlet and color octet channels to the total cross - section . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the color singlet model ( csm )  @xcite prediction , we find that in our formalism the cs contribution is only 10% of the total cross section . </S>",

    "<S> the results become sensitive to @xmath90 in either the projectile or target ( and conversely very small @xmath0 in the target or projectile ) . at these forward ( or backward ) rapidities , as discussed previously , the matching of the dipole amplitude to the unintegrated pdfs at large @xmath0 is important . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : pt ] , we compare our results for @xmath1 differential cross section as a function of @xmath2 with experimental data at several c.m energies and rapidity regions . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that small @xmath2 data is well described by our cgc+nrqcd formalism . </S>",
    "<S> further , as anticipated in the previous discussion , the results in this formalism begin to disagree with data at higher @xmath2 . from previous experience with single inclusive lhc data  @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> one expects to overshoot the data with mv initial conditions  this is precisely what we see . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : pt ] , we also show the nlo collinear factorized nrqcd results  @xcite which show good agreement with data at large @xmath2 . </S>",

    "<S> most of the experimental data presented are for inclusive @xmath17 production . </S>",
    "<S> these include @xmath1 s produced from @xmath96-meson decays as well as prompt production of @xmath1 s . </S>",
    "<S> the latter includes feeddown from higher excited charmonium states as well as direct @xmath17 production . </S>",
    "<S> however we only considered direct @xmath17 production contribution in our theory results . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the comparison is meaningful . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , the @xmath96-meson decay contribution in the small @xmath2 region is small , of order less than 10% . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , the ldmes in @xcite are obtained by fitting prompt @xmath17 data . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath1 production data is feasible in the near future . as a first step , we compare our results for the @xmath3 differential cross section as a function of @xmath2 with data in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : pt ] . in this comparison </S>",
    "<S> , we set the charm quark mass to be @xmath97 and used the co ldmes extracted in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> theory and data agree well . however , if we set @xmath80 for @xmath3 , the results overshoot the data . as noted </S>",
    "<S> , one anticipates the sensitivity to the quark mass in the short distance cross sections to be offset by their dependence in the ldmes . </S>",
    "<S> however , for @xmath3 , only two linear combinations of the three co ldmes of @xmath98 can be determined  @xcite ; because it is unconstrained , we set @xmath99}}}})\\rangle}}=0 $ ] here . thus @xmath3 has larger systematic uncertainties relative to @xmath17 that subsume the sensitivity of results to the quark mass . </S>",
    "<S> based on our present work , all three @xmath98 co ldmes can be determined from a global fit . </S>",
    "<S> a consistent treatment of all charmonium and bottomonium states is in progress @xcite . in the latter case </S>",
    "<S> , we anticipate a larger contribution from the logarithmic resummation of @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> comparing our results to related work , @xmath17 total cross sections were studied recently in the csm within the broad framework of collinear factorization  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while the trend of the total cross section is described , the theory uncertainties have to be as large as a factor of 10 for data to lie within errors . </S>",
    "<S> likewise , the cem with collinear factorization  @xcite describes the total cross section , rapidity distributions and @xmath2 distributions with much larger uncertainties than our framework .    </S>",
    "<S> the results presented here are timely given the wealth of data extant and anticipated from rhic to lhc for p+p and p+a collisions . </S>",
    "<S> when combined with developments in collinearly factorized nrqcd , they set the groundwork for a comprehensive understanding of the mechanism of heavy quark hadronization in qcd . </S>"
