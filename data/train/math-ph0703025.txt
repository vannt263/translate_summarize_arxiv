    ", it is believed that there is no algorithm that solves this problem in time polynomial in @xmath8 ( or @xmath10 ) .",
    "this class of optimization problems has been widely discussed in the computer science literature .",

    "this class of problems is general enough to model physical problems , where one seeks the lowest - energy state of a set of particles having pairwise attractive or repulsive forces .",
    "even special cases have subtle computational - complexity issues .",
    "for example , suppose that one is given a set of @xmath8 _ integer grid points _ and the objective is to find a set of @xmath10 points that minimizes the average pairwise manhattan or euclidean distance between points .",
    "it is not known if these special cases are np - complete , and no polynomial - time algorithms have been discovered .",
    "furthermore , even if the original @xmath8 points make up a square region of the grid it is not known if this problem is np - complete .",
    "this family of problems is so computationally difficult that the usual approach in the literature has been to find algorithms that produce approximate solutions  @xcite .",
    "this paper presents the solution to a continuum version of an optimization problem from this class of discrete problems . to be specific ,",
    "our limited objective here is to identify and to characterize the optimal two - dimensional geometrical shape of a blob that minimizes the average pairwise distance between points in the blob . an intuitive way to understand the optimal shape is to view think of the blob as a city . by optimal , we mean that the average travel distance between any two points in the city is minimized . for the case of a city ,",
    "a particularly appropriate metric is the _",
    "manhattan distance _ , which is the sum of the east - west distance along streets and the north - south distance along avenues .",
    "it is interesting that while the optimal shape of a city is not circular , it is extremely close to circular  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider the general case of @xmath0 norms in @xmath3 , for which the @xmath0 distance between two points @xmath1 and @xmath11 is defined to be @xmath12 we use variational methods to determine the shape of the region that minimizes the average @xmath0 distance when the area of this region is held fixed .",

    "we then examine three special cases : for @xmath5 ( the euclidean metric ) the integral equation reduces to a separable first - order nonlinear differential equation , whose solution , as one would expect , is a circle . for @xmath6 ( the manhattan metric ) and for @xmath7 ( the _ maximum _ or _ chebychev _ metric ) the integral equation reduces to the second - order nonlinear differential equations that are previously derived in refs .",
