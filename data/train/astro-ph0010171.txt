    "the bbn prediction of a large primeval abundance of @xmath2he ( @xmath4 ) was the first success of the hot big - bang model . for two decades",
    "the consistency of the bbn predictions for the abundances of d , @xmath1he , @xmath2he and @xmath3li with their inferred primeval abundances has been an important test of the standard cosmology at early times ( @xmath5sec ) .",
    "bbn has also been used to `` inventory '' ordinary matter at a simpler time and to probe fundamental physics ( see e.g. , schramm & turner 1998 or olive et al .",
    "2000 ) .    with the detection of the deuterium ly-@xmath6 feature in the absorption spectra of 3 high - redshift ( @xmath7 ) quasars and the accurate determination of the primeval abundance of deuterium , ( d / h)@xmath8 ( burles et al .",
    "2000 ; tytler et al .",
    "2000 ; omeara et al .",
    "2001 ) bbn has entered a new precision era ( schramm & turner 1998 ) . because its abundance depends strongly upon the baryon density , and its subsequent chemical evolution is so simple ( astrophysical processes only destroy d ) , deuterium can accurately peg the baryon density .",
    "once determined , the baryon density allows the abundances of @xmath1he , @xmath2he and @xmath3li to be predicted .",
    "these predictions can be used to test the consistency of the big - bang framework and to probe astrophysics .",
    "the chemical evolution of @xmath2he is simple ( stars produce it ) and so its predicted abundance , @xmath9 ( lopez & turner 1999 ) , can be used as a consistency test of bbn and the standard cosmology . because the @xmath3li abundance in old pop ii stars may be depleted , lithium probes both stellar models and the consistency of the standard cosmology .",
    "while the post - big - bang evolution of @xmath1he is complex , the sum d+@xmath1he can be used to study the chemical evolution of the galaxy .",
    "all stars burn d to @xmath1he as they evolve onto the main sequence ( ms ) .",
    "later stages of stellar evolution may produce or destroy @xmath1he , depending on stellar mass and subject to uncertainty in modeling .",
    "thus , the evolution of d+@xmath1he measures the net stellar production of @xmath1he beyond pre - ms burning ( yang et al .",
    "1984 ) , providing an important probe of stellar models .",
    "a key to realizing bbn s full potential in the precision era is accurate and reliable predictions . with this in mind , we have recently used monte - carlo techniques ( burles et al . 1999 ; nollett & burles 2000 ) to link the calculated abundances directly to the nuclear data , making the predictions more reliable .    previous work ( smith et al . 1993 , fiorentini et al . 1998 ) was based on fitting cross - section data to standard forms , estimating conservative uncertainties to accommodate most or all of the data for each reaction .",
    "very recent work ( esposito et al . 2000 ; vangioni - flam et al . 2000 ) computes only `` maximum '' uncertainties , using upper and lower limits quoted in a compilation of charged - particle reaction rates ( angulo et al .",
    "in contrast , our procedure ties the abundance errors directly to the experimental measurements by weighting the data by their quoted errors , and furthermore , leads to smaller estimated abundance errors ( by factors of 2 - 3 ) .    in this _ letter _",
    "we present our results in the form of analytic fits for the abundances and their error matrix .",
    "we then use these predictions to make inferences about the baryon density , the consistency of bbn , @xmath3li depletion and stellar @xmath1he production .",
    "our bbn code draws reaction rates from a statistical distribution and computes the corresponding distribution of bbn yields .",
    "it varies all of the laboratory data ( over 1200 individual data points ) simultaneously , drawing random realizations of each data point and normalizations for each data set from gaussian distributions representing reported values and uncertainties . for each realization ,",
    "the bbn yields are computed using thermally - averaged smooth representations of the realized data .",
    "the results presented here are based on 25 000 such realizations of the data ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . more details are given in burles et al ( 1999 ) , and nollett & burles ( 2000 ) .",
    "here we present fits of the means , variances , and correlation matrix of the predicted abundances to fifth - order polynomials in @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the baryon - to - photon ratio ; see tables 13 .",
    "applicable over the range @xmath12 , our fits are accurate to better than 0.2% for the abundances and 10% for the variances . for the mean @xmath2he yields , we adopt the fitting formula of lopez & turner ( 1999 ) which is accurate to 0.05% .",
    "some of the abundances follow approximate power laws , and so we have obtained accurate fits by fitting the means and variances of their base - ten logarithms in all cases except the mean @xmath13 . because our estimates for the uncertainties are small , @xmath14 .",
    "the covariance matrix is written in terms of the variances and a correlation matrix @xmath15 : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is baryon fraction for @xmath2he and number relative to hydrogen for the other nuclides , and @xmath18 is its mean over the output yields .",
    "finally , because bbn produces @xmath3li by two distinct processes , direct production and indirect production through @xmath3be with subsequent electron capture to @xmath3li , we have split the @xmath3li yield into these two pieces to obtain more accurate fits .",
    "the mean prediction for @xmath3li is just the sum of the two contributions ; the variance @xmath19 .",
    "the covariance between the total bbn @xmath3li and another nuclide @xmath20 .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ fig : abundances ]",
    "to use our predictions we need observed abundances of the light elements .",
    "this is a lively area of research , with some controversy . here , based upon our evaluation of the data , we state our choices with brief justification and point the reader interested in more detail to the relevant literature .    for the primordial deuterium abundance we use the weighted average of the 3 detections in high - redshift ly-@xmath6 , ( d / h)@xmath21 ( for further discussion see burles et al . 2000 ; tytler et al . 2000 ; omeara et al .",
    "2001 ) .    for the present abundance of d+@xmath1he",
    ", we use measurements of both elements made in the local interstellar medium ( ism ) . the deuterium abundance , d / h@xmath22 , comes from hst , iue and copernicus measurements along 12 lines of sight to nearby stars ( linsky 1998 ; lemoine et al . 1999 ; mccullough 1992 ) .",
    "the first error is statistical , and the second error represents the possibility of scatter due to spatial variations ( vidal - madjar & gry 1984 ; linsky 1998 ; vidal - madjar et al .",
    "1999 ; sonneborn et al .",
    "2000 ) ; as it turns out , the uncertainty in @xmath1he dominates both .",
    "gloeckler & geiss ( 1998 ) have determined the ratio of @xmath1he to @xmath2he in the local ism using the pick - up ion technique . allowing for a local @xmath2he mass fraction between 25% and 30%",
    ", their measurement translates to @xmath1he / h@xmath23 and ( d+@xmath1he)/h@xmath24 .    for the primordial @xmath3li abundance we use the value advocated by ryan ( 2000 ) , based upon the extant measurements of @xmath3li in the atmospheres of old halo stars .",
    "his value , @xmath3li / h@xmath25 , includes empirical corrections for cosmic - ray production , stellar depletion , and improved atmospheric models , and the uncertainty arises mainly from these corrections .",
    "this is consistent with other estimates ( see e.g. , bonifacio & molaro 1997 ; ryan et al .",
    "1999 ; thorburn 1994 ) .",
    "the primordial abundance of @xmath2he is best inferred from hii regions in metal - poor , dwarf emission - line galaxies .",
    "while such measurements are some of the most precise in astrophysics , the values for @xmath13 obtained from the two largest samples of such objects are not consistent and concerns remain about systematic error .",
    "olive et al ( 1997 ) have compiled a large sample of objects and find @xmath26 . on the other hand , izotov & thuan ( 1998 )",
    "have assembled a large sample from a single observational program , extracting @xmath13 from the spectra by a different method .",
    "they find @xmath27 ( consistent with the earlier sample of kunth & sargent 1983 , which found @xmath28 ) .",
    "further , they have shown that at least one of the most metal - poor objects ( izw18 ) used in the earlier sample suffered from stellar absorption , and argue that it and possibly other metal - poor objects in this sample explain the discrepancy .",
    "viegas et al .",
    "( 2000 ) argue that the izotov and thuan sample should be corrected downward by a small amount ( @xmath29 ) to account for neutral and doubly ionized @xmath2he ; ballantyne et al .",
    "( 2000 ) agree on the magnitude of the effect , but not the direction .",
    "finally , a recent study of different parts of a single hii region in the smc finds @xmath30 ( peimbert et al .",
    "2000 ) , at face value implying @xmath31 .",
    "clearly , the final word on @xmath13 is not in . for now , because of the homogeneity and size of the izotov and thuan sample and the possible corruption of the other sample by stellar absorption , with caution we adopt @xmath32 .",
    "( had we adopted an intermediate value , with a systematic error reflecting the discrepancy between the two data sets , our conclusions would be largely the same . )    using these choices , we have constructed separate likelihood functions for the baryon - to - photon ratio @xmath11 from the abundances of d , d+@xmath1he , @xmath2he and @xmath3li , assuming gaussian distributions for the uncertainties ; see fig .  2 .",
    "while the d , d+@xmath1he and @xmath2he abundances are all consistent with @xmath33 , most precisely pegged by d , the @xmath3li abundance favors a significantly lower value . combining these , we find @xmath34 for 3 degrees of freedom ( 4 abundances minus 1 parameter ) .",
    "this is the well - known lithium problem : the deuterium - inferred value for the baryon density predicts a @xmath3li abundance that is about @xmath35 larger than that measured in old pop ii halo stars ( see e.g. , burles et al .",
    "1999 ; or olive et al .",
    "2000 )    since it is possible , and some stellar models suggest , that there has been more depletion of @xmath3li in old halo stars than the 5% inferred by ryan ( 2000 ) , we introduce a model parameter , @xmath36 , the ratio of the inferred @xmath3li / h in old pop ii stars to its predicted primordial value .",
    "it quantifies how much the primordial @xmath3li / h has been affected by additional stellar depletion , cosmic - ray production , or theoretical difficulties ( e.g. , systematic errors in the nuclear cross sections or in the modeling of stellar atmospheres ) .",
    "an @xmath37 might also reflect fundamental problems , such as systematic problems with the deuterium abundance or inconsistencies in bbn .",
    "[ fig : face - value ]    since there is no reason to believe that the present value of @xmath38 in the local ism is the primordial value , we introduce an analogous factor , @xmath39 , which is the ratio of the present @xmath40 to its primordial value .",
    "if @xmath41 , then the light - element abundances are consistent with the simple hypothesis that stars only convert d into @xmath1he during pre - ms burning , conserving d+@xmath1he by number ; @xmath42 indicates additional net stellar production of @xmath1he , and @xmath43 indicates net stellar destruction of @xmath1he after the pre - ms .",
    "3 shows the distributions for @xmath36 and @xmath39 , each marginalized over our other two parameters ( e.g. , the @xmath39 curve results from marginalizing over @xmath11 and @xmath36 ) .",
    "the most likely value for @xmath36 is 0.32 , with 95% confidence interval @xmath44 .",
    "that is , consistency between the deuterium - predicted @xmath3li abundance and the pop ii abundance requires a depletion of greater than a factor of two or some as - yet unidentified source of systematic error in the bbn prediction or measurement .",
    "such depletion can be achieved in stellar models and still be consistent with other observational constraints , including the plateau in @xmath3li abundance in old pop ii stars and the detection of @xmath45li in several stars ( see e.g. , vauclair & charbonnel 1995 ; pinsonneault et al .",
    "1999 ; salaris & weiss 2001 ) .",
    "the most likely value for @xmath39 is 0.88 , with 95% confidence interval @xmath46 .",
    "unlike @xmath36 , this new parameter has essentially no effect on the question of concordance , and its value supports the simple hypothesis of only pre - ms @xmath1he production .",
    "it also disfavors stellar models that predict significant net @xmath1he production ( or destruction ) and is consistent with an earlier comparison of pre - solar and ism measurements of d+@xmath1he which showed no evidence for an increase over the last 4.5gyr ( turner et al .",
    "this is somewhat surprising , since the conventional models for the galactic chemical evolution of @xmath1he predict a significant increase in d+@xmath1he due to net @xmath1he production by low mass stars ( iben & truran 1978 ; dearborn , schramm , & steigman 1986 ) .",
    "however , wasserburg , boothroyd , & sackmann ( 1995 ) argue that @xmath1he destruction by some low - mass stars is possible .    [",
    "fig : d23 ]    bbn and the light - element abundances can be used to fix the baryon - to - photon ratio at the end of bbn ( @xmath47sec ) .",
    "we have computed the likelihood function for the baryon density using the abundances of all four light elements and marginalizing over @xmath36 and @xmath39 , giving all the weight to d and @xmath2he .",
    "we find : @xmath48 , shown as the `` two - parameter '' curve in fig .  2 .",
    "the value is driven almost entirely by deuterium : using the deuterium alone we find @xmath49 .    to relate @xmath11 to the present baryon density ( @xmath50 ) one needs to know the present photon temperature ( @xmath51k ) and the average mass per baryon number , @xmath52 g for the post - bbn mix ( solar abundance ) , and",
    "make the assumption that the expansion has been adiabatic since bbn .",
    "then , @xmath11 and the baryon density are related by @xmath53 . within the standard cosmology",
    ", @xmath54 translates to a baryon density , @xmath55    finally , we mention other recent likelihood analyses of bbn .",
    "hata et al . ( 1995 ) addressed the consistency of bbn , focusing especially on @xmath2he and @xmath3li ( also see copi et al . 1995 ) .",
    "olive & thomas ( 1997 ) and fiorentini et al .",
    "( 1998 ) carried out assessments of bbn using older estimates of the theoretical errors and a broader range for primordial d / h .",
    "the present analysis is the first using the new nollett & burles ( 2000 ) error estimates as well as the recently clarified primeval d / h .",
    "we have presented analytical fits for our new , more accurate predictions of the light - element abundances and their error matrix .",
    "these results have already renewed interest in more accurately determining key nuclear rates , and further improvements are likely ( see e.g. , schreiber et al . 2000 ; rupak 2000 ) .    using our results and the primeval deuterium abundance from three high - redshift ly-@xmath6 systems we infer @xmath0 ( 95% cl ) . for @xmath56 ,",
    "this implies a baryon fraction @xmath57 , with the error dominated by that in @xmath58 .",
    "measurements of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy have recently also determined the baryon density .",
    "the physics underlying this method is very different  gravity - driven acoustic oscillations in the universe at 500 000 yrs  but the result is similar : @xmath59 at 95% cl ( jaffe et al . 2000 ) .",
    "while there is about a @xmath60 difference , this first result from cmb anisotropy confirms the long - standing bbn prediction of a low baryon density , and with it , the need for nonbaryonic dark matter .",
    "the sum of d+@xmath1he predicted for the deuterium baryon density is consistent with that in the ism today , implying no significant production ( or destruction ) of @xmath1he beyond pre - ms burning .",
    "the deuterium - predicted @xmath2he abundance is an important consistency test of bbn ; however , systematic measurement error ( the @xmath13 values from the two key data sets differ by 5 times the statistical error ) precludes firm conclusions at this time .",
    "likewise , the discrepancy between the predicted @xmath3li abundance and the abundance measured in pop ii stars has no simple explanation : the discrepancy could indicate that @xmath3li has been depleted in pop ii stars by about a factor of two , that uncertainties ( in observations or predictions ) have been grossly underestimated , or that there is an inconsistency in bbn ."
