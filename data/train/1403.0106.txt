    "the superfluid response comes from the second shell ( farthest from the wall ) .",

    "the bulk phase exists at @xmath87k .",
    "it can be viewed as two outer shells coexisting with the low density superfluid filling the pore bulk .",
    "the bulk density @xmath59 and the superfluid density ( shown by the c - map ) are both modulated in the radial direction at the wavelength corresponding to the roton .",
    "these modulations observed in a sample @xmath88k are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : roton ] .",
    "these are the precursors of the shells which eventually form the cs and css .",

    ", the strong attractive wall potential creates several ( here we show two ) outmost hexagonal shells wrapped around the wall .",
    "since being closely packed in 2d , such shells minimize the surface energy .",
    "the @xmath85 axis in these shells is oriented radially with respect to the pore axis . in the inner part of the pore ,",
    "however , the @xmath85 axis is aligned with the cylinder axis similarly to the director in the non - singular nematic disclination solution ( see in ref .",
    "simulations of pores with radii @xmath89@xcite as well as our present work with the pore of almost twice that radius show that this configuration is not realized at least in pores with radii less than @xmath90 30 .",
    "the preferred configuration is the compactified @xmath79 solid shown in the bottom panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : cs_s ] .",
    "this configuration hosts the frank disclination of index @xmath0 , with its core coinciding with the cylinder axis at @xmath91 .",
    "there is a string of atoms arranged along a very narrow line at @xmath91 .",
    "let s consider in detail the ideal compactified @xmath79 geometry .",
    "in order to produce minimal residual strain the a - b hexagonal ( basal ) planes of the standard @xmath79 structure should be rolled into concentric cylinders along the direction of the elementary cell vector belonging to the basal plane so that the orthogonal direction is aligned with the cylinder axis .",
    "eight such shells are seen in the bottom panel in fig .",

    "in addition to the radial compression , there is shear strain of one shell with respect to its neighbor .",
    "the `` quantization '' rule @xmath108 , eq.([shells ] ) implies that the circumference of each shell is broken into 5 equal angular segments , each subtended by an angle @xmath109 . within each segment",
    ", the smallest distance between two atoms from neigboring shells reaches the minimum @xmath110 along one radial line .",
    "[ there are five of such lines forming the @xmath111 symmetric pattern ] .",
    "thus , this strain can be estimated as @xmath112 at its maximum , and about @xmath113 on average for the whole sample . in simulations",
    "we have observed that such strain has been relaxed to about @xmath114 by the static angular modulation of atomic displacement about @xmath115   along the pore axis with the angular period @xmath109 .",
    "[ fig : unrolled ] shows this pattern ( see also fig .  [",

    "thus , the cs structure can be characterized by the @xmath116 compression strain and by about @xmath114 of the shear strain .",
    "we estimate the resulting energy change as being due to the elastic energy @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is determined by elastic constants defining the debye energy @xmath119k of solid 4.thus , the compactification costs about extra @xmath120k per particle . in other words , the non - compactified @xmath79 4 of the same average density represented in the upper panel in fig .",

    "we estimate the energy of such misfit as being larger than @xmath123k .",
    "thus , the total excess energy of the cs can be written as @xmath124 .",

    "<S> our _ ab initio _ simulations show that css must occur in 4 confined to materials with a cylindrical geometry with mesoscopic diameter as large as 30 nm ( see below ) , that is , in vycor glass or in artificially made nanopores . </S>",
    "<S> due to its topological nature , the css is robust against smooth deformations of the pores or disorder , implying that simulations inside an ideal cylinder are sufficient for elucidating its main features . </S>",
    "<S> there are also , as we will see , experimental signatures consistent with its existence . </S>",
    "<S> the description of css as well as of the _ compactified solid _ ( cs ) naturally invokes variables , objects and terminology typical for liquid crystals . </S>",

    "<S> such a modulation as well as the liquid crystal layers both exhibit zero shear response in the tangential directions . </S>",
    "<S> if the hard wall has cylindrical shape , the crests and troughs of the modulation acquire the cylindrical shape and form a structure containing the frank disclination observed in liquid crystals ( see fig.2a in ref .  </S>",

    "<S> this mechanism is similar to the strain - induced superfluid core of some dislocations in _ hcp _ 4 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there is , though , a significant difference between the two : in contrast to dislocations , the disclination is a part of the _ ground state _ of the css and cs . in our simulations </S>",
    "<S> we have observed both phases as well as the transformation between them characterized by a very wide hysteresis which implies that rather long - lived metastable superfluidity can exist at pressures much higher than in macroscopic 3d samples of solid 4 .    </S>",

    "<S> accordingly , @xmath13 winds around the cylinder axis in the same manner as the _ director _ field does in a liquid smectic - a crystal containing frank disclination with the index @xmath0 . at high pressure , </S>",
    "<S> the modulations become crystalline shells which , in addition to the director field @xmath14 setting the local orientation of the hcp axis , must be also described by the intra - shell ( quasi- ) hexagonal order .    similarly to liquid crystals , the contributions of @xmath14 to the energy can be chacterized by _ splay _ , _ twist _ and _ bend _ as well as by shell deformations . given the simplest geometry , we ignore _ twist _ and _ bend _ and consider only the _ splay _ energy e_s ~d^2r dz ( ) ^2 ~(r_0/r ) l_z . </S>",

    "<S> there is also a central ( insulating ) core hosting 4 atoms along a very narrow straight line coinciding with the cylinder axis . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : energy ] . </S>",
    "<S> a weak dependence of @xmath67 vs @xmath34 of the cs shown in fig .  [ fig : nmu ] indicates that doping is still possible in this insulating state . </S>",
    "<S> however , the extra particles ( or vacancies ) do not form a superfluid . </S>",
    "<S> instead , they phase separate , very similarly to the case of macroscopic samples studied in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . lowering @xmath34 below @xmath73k results in a jump - like melting of the cs into the bulk sf ( which gradually transforms into the css as @xmath34 increases ) . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates closing of the hysteresis at its low end as marked by the double sided arrows in the curves @xmath67 vs @xmath34 ( fig .  [ fig : nmu ] ) and in @xmath60 vs @xmath34 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : energy ] ) .    while the cs is metastable at @xmath75k@xmath76k , the css is stable in this region and becomes metastable above @xmath77k . due to the very wide hysteresis a more accurate finding of the transition point turned out to be very challenging . as fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : nmu ] indicates , the upper end of the hysteresis , where the metastable css transforms into the stable cs , could not be determined : the css persisted at @xmath34 as high as 38k , in sharp contrast to the results in the slab geometry with the hysteresis loop being only 4k wide ( see above ) .    _ </S>",
    "<S> discussion_. one of the longstanding open questions is the nature of solid 4 in a vycor . </S>",
    "<S> superfluidity there persists at a pressure @xmath30 as high as 10 - 20 bar above the melting pressure . </S>",
    "<S> several models have been proposed to explain this effect @xcite , including the conjecture that 4 remains liquid close to the vycor wall with the solid forming away from the wall @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> mc simulations of about 200 4 atoms @xcite with the artificially fixed hcp solid at some small distance from the wall support this picture . as our simulations of bigger samples in a realistic geometry show </S>",
    "<S> , there is no liquid layer adjacent to the wall , and , instead , there is a liquid core at the pore center . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that our observations are in contrast to the variational results @xcite predicting that the solid in a nanopore is always a supersolid .    </S>",
    "<S> the wetting models @xcite , where 4 at the wall remains liquid until pressure overcomes the surface tension nucleation barrier , encounter troubles explaining the gradual decrease of the superfluid response with pressure @xcite because the nucleation mechanism implies an abrupt solidification . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the css is characterized by a gradual decrease of its superfluid response with pressure . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental observation of the overall decrease of entropy of the liquid part of 4 in vycor with increasing pressure , seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1c of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , is also consistent with the shrinking of the superfluid core with pressure observed in our simulations .    </S>",
    "<S> our analysis and simulations of the topological phases of 4 in nanopores are directly relevant to pores with radii below a threshold , @xmath78   ( as estimated in the suppl . mat .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , well above typical radii in vycor or gelsil glass . we consider it a lower bound because the cs or css may exist as metastable phases in much larger pores due to the geometrical ( macroscopic ) energy barrier between the compactified and standard @xmath79 solids . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the css can be grown and studied in a more controlled way in artificially created pores .     classification . ]    in the recent experiment @xcite , 4 in vycor was found to be in the _ bcc _ phase at @xmath80 bar and @xmath81k , whereas the transformation to the @xmath79 solid takes place at higher pressure . </S>",
    "<S> the structure factor for cs and css ( averaged over all orientations ) found in our simulations and shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : structure ] is strikingly similar to the one found in ref.@xcite at high pressure . </S>",
    "<S> it features three main peaks in the momentum region @xmath82@xmath83 : one strong and two satellite peaks reminiscent of the three main bragg peaks of _ hcp _ solid . </S>",
    "<S> the higher order peaks are washed out by quantum fluctuations and are `` hidden '' under the wide shoulder at high momenta . in future work it would be important to repeat the experiment @xcite at lower temperatures , as well as to perform the mc simulations at temperatures higher than @xmath38k . </S>",
    "<S> one possibility is that there is a non - trivial transition line in the @xmath84 plane where the compactified _ hcp _ solid becomes a compactified _ bcc _ solid .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we suggest ( and leave the analysis for future work ) that the css disclinations ending at the interface of vycor and the bulk solid 4 may attract ( and also create ) the bulk dislocations with superfluid cores  @xcite , so that the superflow through the bulk becomes possible as observed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> _ conclusion _  when 4 is subjected to geometrical confinement with cylindrical topology , it can be found in the compactified solid and compactified supersolid phases . </S>",
    "<S> both are characterized by the shelled structure reminiscent of smectic - a liquid crystal containing frank s disclination . </S>",
    "<S> while the cs is insulating , the css exhibits superfluid response within the melted core of the disclination . </S>",
    "<S> such a core can persist in a metastable state at pressures significantly exceeding the spinodal for the overpressured superfluid in macroscopic samples of 4 . </S>",
    "<S> this finding offers a compelling explanation for the physics of 4 confined to restricted geometries at high pressure where the local @xmath85 axis , playing the role of the nematic director , can not be uniquely defined everywhere . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in the multiple - connected geometry of nanoporous materials confining 4 the superfluid response at high pressure should be controlled by a network of the disclinations .    </S>",
