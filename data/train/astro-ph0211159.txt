    "the one - point probability distribution function ( pdf ) of a random mass density field @xmath3 , or the counts - in - cells ( cic ) statistics of a discrete random distribution such as galaxies , is probably the first statistics used to reveal the clustering feature of galaxy distribution . in the famous work by edwin hubble ( 1934 ) , he showed that the frequency distribution of galaxy count @xmath4 in angular cells is not gaussian , but lognormal .",
    "this result indicates that the pdf of galaxy distribution is fundamental in characterizing the cosmic mass and velocity fields .",
    "although current samples applied for large - scale structure study have much deeper redshift and much wider angular size than available in hubble s time , the one - point statistics is still frequently applied .",
    "this is because the one - point distribution and its moments contain complete information of the field , which might not be easily detected by other conventional methods . unlike the fourier amplitude ,",
    "cic is not subject to the central limit theorem .",
    "it can detect the non - gaussianity of a field consisting of randomly distributed non - gaussian clumps , while the pdf of the fourier amplitudes is still gaussian due to the central limit theorem ( fan and bardeen 1995 ) .",
    "even the 2nd moment of one - point distribution is different from the 2nd moment of the fourier decomposition  power spectrum .",
    "the former contains perturbations on scales larger than the size of the observed sample , while the latter does not .",
    "therefore , one - point statistics is applied on various samples of large - scale structures , including galaxy surveys ( e.g. hamilton 1985 ; alimi et al 1990 ; gaztaaga 1992 ; szapudi et al 1996 ; kim & strauss 1998 ) , transmitted flux of quasars ly@xmath5 absorption spectrum ( e.g. meiksin & bouchet 1995 ; gaztanaga & croft 1999 ; zhan & fang 2002 ) , and n - body simulation samples ( e.g. coles & jones 1991 ; taylor & watts 2000 ) .",
    "one - point statistics of a density fluctuation field @xmath6 is given by the distribution of the one - point variable @xmath7 , which is a sampling of the field by a window function @xmath8 around position @xmath9 and on scale @xmath10 , i.e. @xmath11 the variable @xmath7 is actually a mean value of the field at position @xmath9 and on scale @xmath10 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath7 gives a pdf description of the field .",
    "eq.(1 ) is a space(@xmath9)-scale(@xmath10 ) decomposition of the field @xmath6 with bases @xmath12 .",
    "most popular windows @xmath8 are gaussian and top - hat filters .",
    "the gaussian windows generally are not orthogonal , i.e. the function @xmath8 does not satisfy @xmath13 , if @xmath14 .",
    "thus , the variables @xmath7 are either incomplete or redundant . in turn",
    ", these may lead to 1 ) loss of information of the field @xmath6 ; and 2 ) false correlation .",
    "it is possible to construct an orthogonal and complete set of bases from top - hat windows .",
    "however , they are not localized in the fourier space",
    ". the index @xmath10 does not refer to a well defined scale @xmath15 . as a consequence ,",
    "the one - point statistics with conventional windows are not suitable for problems with a scale - dependence .",
    "for instance , the redshift distortion on the one - point statistics can be properly estimated only if we know how the redshift distortion depends on the scale and shape of the window function .",
    "therefore , a better algorithm for the one - point statistics is needed , for example , to recover the real - space rms density fluctuation @xmath16 from redshift distortion .    in this paper , we show that these problems can be solved with a multiresolutional decomposition via the discrete wavelet transform ( dwt ) .",
    "the bases of the dwt decomposition are complete , orthogonal , and localized in both physical and fourier spaces .",
    "it was shown in the last few years that the dwt can be employed as an alternative representation in most conventional statistics of cosmic mass and velocity fields , including power spectrum ( pando & fang 1998 ; fang & feng 2000 ; yang et al 2001a , 2002 ) , high order correlations ( pando & fang 1998 ; pando , feng & fang 2001 ; feng , pando & fang 2001 ) , bulk and pair - wise velocity ( zhan & fang 2002 ; yang et al .",
    "2001b ) , and identification of halos and clusters ( xu , fang & wu 2000 ) .",
    "the dwt representation is also able to reveal statistical features , which might not be easily detected without a set of decomposition bases localized in both physical and scale spaces . with the dwt analysis ,",
    "the intermittency of the fluctuations of quasars ly@xmath5 transmitted flux has been detected ( jamkhedkar , zhan & fang 2000 ; pando , feng & fang 2000 ; zhan , jamkhedkar & fang 2001 ; pando et al .",
    "this property can not be simply detected by the popular @xmath8 or fourier decompositions .",
    "we also show that the dwt decomposition is very useful for one - point statistics .",
    "we establish the algorithm of the one - point variable and its moments in considering various corrections , such as poisson sampling and selection function . to demonstrate the advantage of the dwt one - point statistics , we show that one can map between the one - point statistics in real and redshift spaces scale - by - scale , taking account the distortion due to bulk velocity , velocity dispersion and selection function . with these results",
    "one can construct @xmath1 ( redshift distortion parameter ) estimators with moments of the dwt one - point variables .",
    "unlike conventional estimators , the dwt estimators do not need extra - information or _",
    "ad hoc _ assumption when the non - linear redshift distortion is not negligible .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    " 2 presents the algorithm for the pdf of one - point variables with the dwt space - scale decomposition . ",
    "3 discusses the second moment of the one - point variables in considering the effects of poisson sampling and selection function . in",
    "4 we develop the theory of redshift distortion of the dwt one - point variables .",
    " 5 tests the theoretical results in  4 on n - body simulation samples .",
    "the emphases are the redshift - to - real - space mapping of the diagonal and off - diagonal second moments . ",
    "6 shows the application in estimating the redshift distortion parameter . finally , the conclusions and discussions are given in  7 .",
    "the appendix provides relevant formulae for quantities defined in  4 .",
    "we release the codes for calculating these quantities via anonymous ftp at samuri.la.asu.edu/pub/zhan/dwtcic.tgz .",
    "as emphasized in  1 , a key problem for one - point statistics is to have proper window functions @xmath17 , and define the variable with eq.(1 ) . in the dwt analysis",
    ", this is done by the so - called scaling function .",
    "let us first briefly introduce the dwt - decomposition of a random field .",
    "for the details of the mathematical properties of the dwt see mallat ( 1989a , b ) ; meyer ( 1992 ) ; daubechies ( 1992 ) , and for physical applications see fang & thews ( 1998 ) .    to simplify the notation",
    ", we first consider a one - dimensional ( 1-d ) density fluctuation @xmath18 on a spatial range from @xmath19 to @xmath20 .",
    "we first divide the space @xmath20 into @xmath21 segments labeled by @xmath22 .",
    "each segment is of size @xmath23 .",
    "the index @xmath24 can be a positive integer .",
    "it stands for a length scale @xmath23 . the higher the @xmath24 , the smaller the length scale .",
    "even though we often refer some properties to a ( range of ) @xmath24 in the analyses below , it must be read as an association of the properties with the length scale @xmath23 .",
    "the index @xmath25 is for position , and it corresponds to the spatial range @xmath26 .",
    "that is , the space @xmath20 is decomposed into cells @xmath27 .    in the dwt analysis ,",
    "each cell @xmath27 supports two compact functions : the scaling function @xmath28 and the wavelet @xmath29 .",
    "one example of such functions is the daubechies 4 ( d4 ) wavelets , which have to be constructed recursively ( daubechies 1992 ; see also fang & thews 1998 ) .",
    "the properties of d4 wavelets are listed below and in the appendix  a.1 .",
    "we show , in fig . 1 , examples of the d4 scaling function and wavelet , and their fourier transform @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "one can see from fig .",
    "1 that both the scaling function and the wavelet are localized in fourier space as well as in physical space .",
    "generally , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are localized in cell @xmath27 , @xmath30 is localized in the scale range @xmath32 , and @xmath31 in the range @xmath33 , where @xmath34 .",
    "obviously , the scaling function @xmath28 is a window function on scale @xmath24 and around the segment @xmath25 . it can be used to measure the mean field in cell @xmath27 @xmath35 where @xmath36 is called scaling function coefficient ( sfc ) , given by @xmath37 in analogous to eq.(1 ) , eqs.(2 ) and ( 3 ) show that the sfc @xmath36 or @xmath38 can be employed as the variable for one - point statistics .",
    "1 also demonstrates that wavelets are admissible , i.e. @xmath39 , and therefore , they are used to measure the fluctuations of a field with respect to its mean in cells @xmath27 @xmath40 where @xmath41 is called the wavelet function coefficient ( wfc ) .",
    "the scaling function @xmath28 and the wavelet @xmath29 satisfy a set of orthonormal relations as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the kronecker delta function . to be consistent with eq.(5 ) , the scaling function @xmath28 is normalized to @xmath44 with these properties , a 1-d density field @xmath18 can be decomposed into @xmath45 the second term on the r.h.s of eq.(9 ) contains only the information of the field @xmath18 on scales equal to and less than @xmath23 . therefore",
    ", the @xmath21 variables ( sfcs ) @xmath36 , with @xmath46 , completely describe the behavior of the field on scales larger than @xmath23 .",
    "for instance , if the resolution of the sample is @xmath47 , @xmath18 can be described by the @xmath48 sfcs @xmath49 .",
    "because of the orthogonal relation eqs.(5 ) and ( 7 ) , the @xmath21 variables ( sfcs ) @xmath36 are independent and irredundant .    in a functional space consisting of functions , which are smoothed on scales equal to and less than @xmath23 , the completeness of the scaling function @xmath28 can be expressed as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the dirac delta function .",
    "all the above - mentioned results can be easily generalized to three - dimensional ( 3-d ) fields .",
    "let us consider a 3-d distribution @xmath6 in a volume @xmath52 to @xmath53 .",
    "similar to the 1-d case , we divide the volume @xmath54 into cells @xmath55 , where @xmath56 refers to the length scale @xmath57 , and @xmath58 refers to the spatial range of the cell , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , where @xmath61 .",

    "is not needed in calculating the one - point statistics , therefore , we do not show the details of @xmath67 , but only give the orthogonal relations @xmath68 if we consider only functions smoothed on scales equal to and less than the scale of @xmath69 in each dimension , the set of bases @xmath63 is orthogonal and complete .      in one - point statistics ,",
    "the statistical feature of the field @xmath6 is characterized by the moments of the distribution of @xmath70 .",
    "the @xmath71th moment is @xmath72 , where @xmath73 stands for an ensemble average . using eq.(11 ) , we have @xmath74 for a homogeneous field , these moments are @xmath75-independent .",
    "moreover , when the  fair sample hypothesis \" ( peebles 1980 ) holds , or equivalently , when the random field is ergodic , the @xmath76 sfcs @xmath70 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 for a given scale @xmath69 can be considered as @xmath76 independent measurements , because they are measured by projecting onto the mutually orthogonal basis @xmath63 .",
    "accordingly , the @xmath76 sfcs form a statistical ensemble on the scale @xmath69 .",
    "this ensemble represents actually the one - point distribution of @xmath70 over the dwt modes at a given scale @xmath69 .",
    "thus , the average over @xmath75 is a fair estimation of the ensemble average , i.e. @xmath77",
    "we now consider the 2nd moment @xmath78 . from eq.(15 ) , the 2nd moment is determined by the usual two point correlation function @xmath79 .",
    "we define a dimensionless 2nd moment on scale @xmath69 by @xmath80 using eqs.(12 ) and ( 15 ) , one can rewrite eq.(17 ) as @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the fourier transform of the basic scaling function ( see eq.(a1 ) in appendix a ) .",
    "the term @xmath83 in eq .",
    "( 18 ) is the fourier power spectrum defined by @xmath84 where @xmath85 with @xmath86 , and @xmath87    one can compare the 2nd moment @xmath88 with the dwt power spectrum given by fang & feng ( 2000 ) as @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the fourier transform of the basic wavelet .",
    "therefore , both the dwt power spectrum and the dwt one - point statistics can be calculated with a single dwt decomposition .",
    "the former relies on the wavelet , while the latter on the scaling function .",
    "the fourier transform of the scaling function @xmath82 is non - zero in @xmath91-space where @xmath92 , and @xmath90 is mainly in @xmath93 ( fig . 1 and eq.(a4 ) ) .",
    "therefore , the dwt power spectrum @xmath94 is actually a banded fourier power spectrum in the wavenumber range @xmath95 , while the 2nd moment @xmath96 contains all powers with @xmath97 .",
    "it is well known that the 2nd moment of one - point statistics , such as @xmath88 or @xmath16 , is sensitive to long wavelength behavior of the perturbations .",
    "this can also be seen from the relation between the scaling functions and wavelets as follows @xmath98 that is , the factor @xmath99 in eq.(22 ) extracts all powers on scales larger than @xmath23 .",
    "eq.(22 ) holds only for compactly supported discrete wavelets such as daubechies wavelets .",
    "we now consider distributions of discrete objects , such as simulation particles and observed or mock galaxies .",

    "4 is that @xmath264 and @xmath265 are almost equal to 1 from @xmath266 to 6 , which corresponds to spatial scales from 200 to 12.5 h@xmath0 mpc on the celestial sphere , and 200 to 100 h@xmath0 mpc along the los .",

    "the factor @xmath263 is sensitive to @xmath261 ( as a variable ) when the scale along the los is small , but insensitive when the scale is large .",

    "if we try to use a scale - independent @xmath269 to recover the real space power spectrum , we should chose @xmath269 to give a good fitting on small scales , because the value of @xmath269 does not significantly affect the large scales .",

    ", we benefit from the dwt representation to see the different behavior of the two types of the redshift distortion .",
    "the former is sensitive to the shape of the mode , not the scale , while the latter just the contrary .",
    "we neglect the effect of selection function here for the simulation samples , which is similar to that on the dwt power spectrum tested in yang et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . since the matrix @xmath168 is quasi - diagonalized with respect to @xmath274 , we have approximately @xmath275 .",
    "thus , eq.(59 ) yields @xmath276 in eq.(75 ) , the contributions of the operators @xmath165 and @xmath166 to the redshift distortion are separated .",
    "usually terms of @xmath166 ( @xmath249 and @xmath250 ) are called linear redshift distortion , and that of @xmath165 ( @xmath258 ) non - linear distortion .",
    "these terminologies may cause a confusion . here",
    "`` linear '' means only that @xmath166 is from the linear term of @xmath190 in the approximation eq.(48 ) , and `` non - linear '' means that @xmath165 is non - linear of the velocity dispersion @xmath277 . it does not imply that the terms of @xmath166 is enough for estimating the redshift distortion of a field that is in the linear regime . since the velocity dispersion @xmath269 is non - zero in the linear regime , the non - linear distortion term of @xmath165 may also play a non - negligible role even when the field is linear . in this paper , we follow the tradition to call the terms of @xmath166 and @xmath165 the linear and non - linear effects of redshift distortion , respectively . however , it should be kept in mind that these names do not reflect whether the field is linear or non - linear .    for @xmath69-diagonal modes , equation ( 75 )",
    "reduces to @xmath278 .",
    "the factors within the parentheses are known as the linear redshift - to - real space mapping for two - point correlation function ( kaiser 1987 ) .",
    "figure 5 shows the recovery of @xmath69-diagonal @xmath88 .",
    "it is evident that the recovery equation ( 75 ) works very well on all scales and redshifts considered , except for the scdm model at @xmath279 . due to greater @xmath1 parameters , the distortions of the tcdm and",
    "the scdm models are generally stronger than that of the rest .",
    "for these two models , @xmath280 is almost parallel to @xmath88 , which indicates a very weak non - linear redshift distortion on all scales .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the velocity dispersions of the two models are small on all scales compared to the others . since the volume of a cubic cell with @xmath281h@xmath0mpc on each side is approximately the same as that of a sphere with a radius of @xmath282h@xmath0mpc , the values of @xmath283 are consistent with @xmath284 at corresponding redshifts for each model .",
    "the differences , nevertheless , are due to the difference in the window functions .",
    "similar to @xmath88 , one can generalize @xmath16 to @xmath285 , which is the _ rms _ density fluctuation in a sphere of radius @xmath10 .",
    "since the behavior of @xmath286 is the same as @xmath287 , one can recover the real space @xmath285 from the redshift space @xmath288 in a similar way as eq.(75 ) , i.e. @xmath289^{1/2 } \\sigma_r$ ] , where @xmath24 is chosen to match the volumes of the dwt cell and the spherical top - hat window of radius @xmath10 .",
    "figure 6 demonstrates the recovery of @xmath285 for all the models .",
    "it is a coincidence that @xmath290 for the low density models .",
    "figures 7 and 8 give the recovery of off - diagonal @xmath88 .",
    "this recovery works well on scales above 50 h@xmath0 mpc . on scales",
    "less than 50 h@xmath0 mpc , the error is noticeable but still small .",
    "this is partially due to the approximation of the quasi - diagonality of the covariance @xmath291 in equation ( 56 ) .",
    "moreover , the separation between the factors involving operators @xmath165 and @xmath166 in eq.(75 ) is not perfect as well .",
    "the errors of recovering @xmath88 can be more clearly seen via a comparison with the recovery of the dwt power spectrum from redshift space @xmath292 to real space @xmath293 .",
    "it is ( yang et al .",
    "2002 ) @xmath294 where @xmath295 is defined by eq.(50 ) but with replacement of @xmath296 to @xmath297 .",
    "the factors @xmath298 and @xmath299 also satisfy @xmath300 and @xmath301 .",
    "the non - linear term @xmath302 behaves the same as @xmath258 , but with a little stronger dependence on @xmath69 .",
    "we find that the recovery of @xmath88 by eq.(75 ) has an error within 10% in most cases , while the dwt power spectrum recovery eq.(76 ) is accurate to 5% or better .",
    "this is because that the quasi - diagonality of the sfc s covariance @xmath303 is poorer than the quasi - diagonality of the wfc s covariance @xmath304 .",
    "as we know from the dwt analysis , the covariance @xmath305 is always quasi - diagonal for a gaussian field , regardless the power spectrum . on the other hand ,",
    "the quasi - diagonality of the covariance @xmath306 is not a generic mathematical property , but only an approximation .",
    "all the above algorithms can be applied to real samples as well . however , there are several problems to be considered in the analysis on real data .",
    "data assignment on grid _    to calculate the moments of counts - in - cells , one has to cast a grid on the data set either explicitly or implicitly , and assign the data in cells defined by the grid .",
    "the arbitrariness of the assignment may lead to significant error ( colombi , bouchet & schaeffer 1995 ) .",
    "one way to reduce this error is to shift the grid .",
    "it is well known that this assignment may also result in spurious features of the power spectrum on scales around the nyquist frequency of the grid . in the dwt analysis",
    ", one can use different grids , but no shift is needed . for a given grid ,",
    "the assignment is realized by the same scaling function used for the data decomposition . since scaling functions",
    "are orthogonal and complete in each given scale @xmath69 , the spurious features and false correlations can be completely avoided ( fang & feng 2000 ) . to test the effect of the assignment on the one point statistics , we calculate @xmath287 for a snapshot sample of lcdm1 with randomly shifted grids .",
    "the snapshot sample is take at @xmath307 . in fig .",
    "9 , snap-0 represents @xmath287 without grid shifting , while snap-32 and snap-1024 , respectively , the average over 32 , and 1024 random shifts for grids on all scales .",
    "no significant deviation is detected among the results .",
    "_ 2 . boundary condition and edge effect _    in a real survey , the edge effect is unavoidable due to the geometry ( e.g. szapudi & colombi 1996 ) .",
    "since the dwt bases are localized in physical space , the effect of edges can be effectively suppressed by dropping modes that are close to the boundary of the samples . in other words ,",
    "when calculating @xmath88 , the averaging in eq.(17 ) runs only over modes that are not significantly affected by the edge effect , and the normalization factor @xmath308 is replaced by the volume over which the average takes place .",
    "this method has been tested numerically in the power spectrum detection ( pando & fang 1998b ) .",
    "it shows that the power spectrum can be fairly reconstructed regardless whether applying a periodic boundary or zero padding outside of the samples .",
    "the treatment of dropping edge modes has also been successfully employed to obtain the power spectrum for the las campanas redshift survey of galaxies , which has a slice - like geometry ( yang et al .",
    "when the interested scale is close to the dimension of the sample , one can not afford to drop all the edge modes , and then a more thorough treatment is needed .",
    "the edge effect exists in our simulation sample because the light - cone output is not periodic along the redshift axis , while we have used periodic d4 wavelets in the analysis . for comparison , the real - space light - cone @xmath287 from fig . 5",
    "is included in fig .",
    "9 . there is no significant difference between the results from the snapshot , which is truly periodic , and that from the light - cone around the same redshift .",
    "the slightly larger standard deviation of the light - cone result at 200 @xmath238mpc ( a quarter of the simulation box ) is due to a larger fraction of edge cells .",
    "non - poisson sampling _    in  3.3 , we have considered the correction for poisson sampling .",
    "it is sufficient for simulation samples .",
    "however , it may not be typical for real samples . for instance , some galaxy catalogs may be given by sub - poisson sampling on small scales , or small halos ( e.g. bullock , wechsler & somerville , 2002 ) .",
    "the sub - poisson distribution is simply due to very low mass of the considered halo , so that it can not host any additional objects . in other words ,",
    "the sub - poisson distribution is significant on small scales on which galaxies are anticorrelated .",
    "therefore , this sub - poisson sampling is similar to the sub - poisson distribution of the fermi - dirac statistics ( one state can host no more than one particle ) .",
    "the effect of this sub - poisson has been extensively studied in quantum optics ( e.g. martin & landauer , 1992 ) .",
    "it is possible to extend the poisson sampling eq.(35 ) to include fermi - like sampling .",
    "the algorithm for a modified poisson sampling has been developed by jamkhedkar , bi and fang ( 2001 ) ( see their append b ) .",
    "we first consider a @xmath1 estimator without non - linear effect .",
    "for instance , @xmath309 ( fig .",
    "4 ) , i.e. the non - linear effects are small above 100 h@xmath0 mpc along the los , eq.(75 ) gives @xmath310 it is easy to construct a @xmath1 estimator with eq.(77 ) , because the quantities @xmath88 , @xmath280 , and @xmath311 are not rotationally invariant , but they satisfy the following symmetries with respect to the triple indices @xmath312 .    1 .   if the cosmic density and velocity fields are statistically isotropic , @xmath88 in real space is invariant with respect to cyclic permutations of index @xmath56 , i.e. @xmath313 2 .   in the plane - parallel approximation ,",
    "i.e. the coordinate @xmath112 is in the redshift direction , we have @xmath314 @xmath315    using eqs.(77)-(80 ) , we have a @xmath1 estimator as follows @xmath316 eq.(81 ) looks very similar to the @xmath1 estimator with quadrupole - to - monopole ratio , or the multipole moments of two - point correlation function .",
    "however , eq.(81 ) contains not only the information of shape ( like multipole moments ) , but also scales .",
    "all the dwt quantities in eq.(77 ) are on scale @xmath69 .",
    "that is , the @xmath1 in eq.(77 ) refers to mode @xmath56 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath1 is scale - dependent , the @xmath1 estimated by eq.(81 ) is its value referring to @xmath69 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath1 is scale - free , the values of @xmath1 given by estimator eq.(81 ) with different mode @xmath69 should be the same .",
    "figure 10 plots the results in the case of a scale - free @xmath1 for the lcdm1 model using estimators with @xmath317 .",
    "the results indeed show that the estimated @xmath1 is independent of the @xmath69 used in the estimator , and it follows the theoretical curves in the entire redshift range considered .",
    "therefore , we expect that the estimator ( 81 ) would be useful to study the scale - dependence of bias parameters of galaxies .    for comparison , fig 11 shows the @xmath1 estimated from quadrupole - to - monopole ratio as @xmath318 where @xmath319 and @xmath320 are the quadrupole moment and the monopole moment of the power spectrum @xmath321 respectively ( cole , fisher & weinberg 1994 , hereafter cfw ; hamilton 1997 ) .",
    "we average the results from wavelength 50 h@xmath0mpc to 400 h@xmath0mpc for each realization .",
    "thus the error bars are among different realizations of each model .",
    "as noticed in cfw , this estimator gives a lower @xmath1 than the true value at @xmath214 even for wavelengths @xmath322 h@xmath0mpc .",
    "in addition , we find that it progressively overestimates @xmath1 at higher and higher redshifts .",
    "it is suggested in cfw that the underestimate at short wavelengths is due to the impact of non - linear gravitational clustering .",
    "however , this explanation is still difficult to apply for the underestimate at long wavelengths , and the overestimate at high redshift , as cosmic field on long wavelengths or high redshifts should be linear .",
    "this discrepancy occurs because the quadrupole - to - monopole ratio eq.(82 ) is scale - dependent even when the field is in linear regime .",
    "this scale - dependence is given by the non - linear redshift distortion , or the distortion of velocity dispersion .",
    "as mentioned in  5.3 , @xmath277 is non - zero in linear clustering regime , the non - linear redshift distortion ( or the distortion of @xmath277 ) should be considered regardless whether the field is linear or non - linear .",
    "therefore , the discrepancy in cfw can not be eliminated for long wavelengths or high redshift . to solve this problem , extra information , such as the power - spectrum index of the density fluctuations , or the real - space correlation function ,",
    "is added in the quadrupole - to - monopole ratio estimator eq.(82 ) ( peacock et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "different from the quadrupole - to - monopole ratio , the dwt @xmath1 estimators are scale - decomposed .",
    "it is useful to consider scale - dependent effect .",
    "the dwt estimators are able to consider the non - linear redshift distortion ( @xmath277 redshift distortion ) without assuming extra information .",
    "actually , the result with estimator eq.(81 ) has already shown the effect of the non - linear redshift distortion .",
    "we can see from fig .",
    "10 that the @xmath1 estimated by eq.(81 ) are slightly dependent on @xmath24 , and it is progressively higher in the order @xmath323 .",
    "this can be explained with fig .",
    "4 , which shows that the factor @xmath258 is less than one , and is smaller for a smaller scale .",
    "thus the estimator eq.(81 ) , which ignores the factor @xmath258 in eq.(77 ) , leads to a progressively higher @xmath1 in the order @xmath323 .",
    "thus , a simplest way to estimate the non - linear effect is to take an average over @xmath1 given by eq.(81 ) with different @xmath24 .",
    "the left panel of figure 12 presents the averaged @xmath1 from fig .",
    "10 for the four models .",
    "the error bars contain the contribution of the non - linear effect .",
    "that is , the dwt algorithm can do a self - test on whether the result is largely affected by the non - linear effect .",
    "more delicate @xmath1 estimators can be constructed if we consider the following properties : the non - linear factor @xmath258 depends only on @xmath270 , but independent of @xmath273 if the los scale is above 100 h@xmath0mpc , while the linear factors @xmath249 and @xmath250 depends only on the shape of the dwt mode (  5.2 ) .",
    "these properties apply to @xmath302 , @xmath298 , and @xmath299 as well .",
    "thus , we can combine modes with similar @xmath270 but different shapes to cancel the non - linear factors , such as @xmath324 thus , from eq.(76 ) , we have a @xmath1 estimator as @xmath325 this estimator is similar to that in yang et al .",
    "it can be used for any pairs ( @xmath24 @xmath326 @xmath327 ) even when the scale of @xmath24 is small .",
    "the right panel of figure 12 shows that for the four models , the @xmath1 estimated by eq.(84 ) has no more than about 15% error at all redshifts @xmath328 .",
    "one can also use the modes @xmath329 , @xmath330 to replace modes @xmath331 and @xmath332 in eqs.(83 ) and ( 84 ) , which gives similar results to fig .",
    "that is , the weakly non - linear redshift distortion can be considered by the dwt @xmath1 estimators on scales until about @xmath333 h@xmath0 mpc when the quadrupole - to - monopole estimator shows significant errors ( fig .",
    "the counterpart of eq.(84 ) with @xmath88 , @xmath334 is not as good as eq.(84 ) .",
    "it causes an error of about 40% in @xmath1 because again the quasi - diagonality of the sfc s covariance is poorer than that of wfc s . since a dwt decomposition of a random field yields variables for calculating both the power spectrum and one - point statistics , the @xmath1 estimations with eqs.(81 ) and ( 84 )",
    "can be done in the same time .",
    "an accurate @xmath1 estimator requires the knowledge of a precise recovery of @xmath293 or @xmath88 , which accounts for the non - linear redshift distortion due to the velocity dispersion , and even the second order effect of the bulk velocity ignored in eq.(48 ) . in other words ,",
    "the non - linear redshift distortion exists even on scales that are linear in the sense of structure formation , and it must be corrected to achieve a reliable and accurate @xmath1 .",
    "we have developed the one - point statistics of a perturbed density field with the multiresolutional decomposition based on discrete wavelet transform .",
    "since the scale and shape of the dwt bases are well defined , this frame work is very effective to deal with problems of how the one - point distribution and its moments depend on the scale and shape of the window function . with this property ,",
    "we have established the algorithm of one - point variable and its moments in considering the effects of poisson sampling and selection function .",
    "we have also established the algorithm for recovering the dwt one - point statistics from the redshift distortion due to bulk velocity , velocity dispersion and selection function .",
    "because the recovery of the real - space dwt one - point variable and its moments can be realized scale - by - scale , one can design @xmath1 estimators which are sensitive to the scale - dependence of @xmath1 , for instance , caused by the scale - dependence of bias parameter of galaxies .",
    "these @xmath1 estimators are effective in avoiding the difficulty caused by the scale - dependence of the non - linear redshift distortion . compared with conventional @xmath1 estimators ( peacock et al 2001 )",
    ", the dwt @xmath1 estimators do not need to assume that the velocity dispersion is scale - independent , or to add extra information , such as the power - spectrum index or the real - space correlation function of the field .",
    "numerical tests by n - body simulation samples show that the proposed estimators can yield the correct value of @xmath1 with about 15% uncertainty for all popular cdm models in the redshift range @xmath335 .    since dwt decomposition contains two sets of bases , the scaling function @xmath28 and wavelet @xmath29 , a dwt decomposition of a density field @xmath18 actually yields variables for one - point statistics @xmath336 as well as the variables for calculating the power spectrum @xmath337 ( fang & feng 2000 ) .",
    "in this sense , one can say that the dwt decomposition unifies the algorithm of cic and power spectrum , which are only two aspects of the statistics with the dwt variables sfcs and wfcs respectively . for a finite size sample , these two aspects of statistics can play different roles : the former contains information of the perturbations on scales larger than the size , while the latter does not .",
    "however , the latter generally has diagonalized covariance , while the former does not . therefore ,",
    "the @xmath1 estimators with wfcs are better than sfcs , while sfcs are useful to estimate the effect of perturbations on large scales .",
    "actually , the dwt decomposition can provide more types of statistics variables . for 2-d or 3-d samples",
    ", we have variables defined as @xmath338 @xmath339 obviously , these variables are sampled partially by the scaling function @xmath28 , and partially by the wavelet @xmath29 .",
    "statistics with these variables are not typical cic , or power spectrum . they are , however , useful to study the one - point statistics , or power spectrum of 2-d and 3-d samples . with the method developed in this paper , it is not difficult to calculate various corrections ( poisson sampling , selection function , redshift distortion ) on the one - point statistics with variables ( 86 ) or ( 87 ) .",
    "hz is grateful to daniel eisenstein for extensive discussions on this paper and facilitating the lcdm2 simulation .",
    "hz would also like to thank david burstein for hosting the utility codes in this paper .",
    "let us consider the plane - parallel approximation , i.e. coordinate @xmath112 is in the redshift direction . by definition eq.(50 )",
