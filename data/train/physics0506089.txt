    "the introduction of kerr - lens mode - locked lasers ( klml ) as referenced optical frequency synthesizers @xcite represents a milestone in optical frequency synthesis . before the advent of klml , optical frequency synthesis and measurements",
    "were generally performed through harmonic generation in frequency chains @xcite relying on involved apparatuses . in addition , only narrow portions of the optical spectrum were accessible .",
    "alternative techniques of frequency interval bisection @xcite and optical comb generators @xcite simplified to some extent the task of synthesizing optical frequencies , but still could not provide a single instrument to cover the whole optical spectrum from the visible to the near infra - red .    by providing a wide ruler of well spaced optical frequencies ,",
    "klml now represent the best solution to measure and synthesize optical frequencies ranging from the near ir to most of the visible .",
    "these lasers have a spectrum composed by a comb of frequencies @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the repetition rate of the pulsed laser , @xmath2 is the carrier envelope offset frequency , and @xmath3 is an integer @xcite . on one hand , optical frequency measurements are performed by measuring the beat note between the optical frequency @xmath4 to be measured and the closest tooth of the klml comb , and then determining the integer @xmath3 from a rough wavelength measure . on the other hand , an optical frequency can be synthesized by locking the frequency of a continuous wave optical field to a tooth of the klml comb .    from the practical point of view ,",
    "such optical measurements depend critically on two issues : the determination and stabilization of the comb parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and the amount of power available at the frequency component @xmath5 closest to the one of the laser field to be measured @xcite . while @xmath1 is directly available from the amplitude modulation of the klml , the determination and stabilization of @xmath2 , typically known as _ self - referencing _ ,",
    "involves delicate manipulation of the ultra - broadband light , e.g. by means of nonlinear optical processes such as frequency doubling of the red tail of the spectrum and its beating with the blue tail @xcite or even more complex schemes , as discussed in  @xcite .",
    "this , in turn , requires the use of octave - spanning sources such as ti : sa femto - second lasers spectrally broadened through micro - structured fibers @xcite , or ultra - broadband femto - second lasers @xcite . from the point of view of the power available on the frequency component @xmath5 of interest , self - referenced comb generators were demonstrated to have a suitable spectrum to measure frequencies in the wavelength range from 500 nm up to 2@xmath6 m @xcite .",
    "the region of optimal sensitivity for the measurement depends on the frequency comb spectral envelope and therefore on the nature of the medium used to generate the ultra - broadband spectrum @xcite .",
    "we propose a different approach to directly synthesize optical fields from mode - locked lasers .",
    "the basic idea consists in the conversion of the comb of frequency components present in a mode - locked laser into a single frequency component @xmath7 .",
    "the idea can be implemented to devise an optical rectifier that efficiently converts a pulsed light source into a monochromatic continuous wave optical field .",
    "two regions of the spectrum of a mode - locked laser are sent through a non - linear crystal so as to generate radiation via difference frequency generation ( dfg ) . the nonlinear polarization in the crystal",
    "is composed by a comb of frequency which are integer multiples of the repetition rate @xmath1 .",
    "an optical cavity surrounds the non - linear crystal and is resonant with the polarization component at frequency @xmath7 , while all other components are off - resonance with respect to all cavity modes . in these conditions ,",
    "the polarization mode at @xmath7 solely contributes to the field circulating in the cavity , hence a nearly monochromatic radiation is generated with a power proportional to the finesse of the cavity .",
    "this results in a power on the component at @xmath7 orders of magnitude higher than the one that would be obtained by means of a simple frequency filtering of the radiation generated by a single - pass dfg .",
    "moreover , the suppression of all non resonant components by the action of the cavity results in a significant reduction of the amplitude noise spectrum .",
    "consider a ring cavity of total length @xmath8 containing a slab of nonlinear medium of length @xmath9 , as sketched in fig.[fig : setup ] .",
    "the cavity mirrors are assumed to be perfectly transmitting for the source laser light so as to avoid the need of matching the cavity spectral range with the comb spacing , but highly reflecting at the @xmath10 of the radiation to be generated so as to take advantage of resonance effects at @xmath10 . here",
    ", the reflectivity @xmath11 of three mirrors will be taken exactly 1 , while the fourth one will have a finite but small transmission @xmath12 and will be considered as the output of the system .",
    "the source beam consists of a train of ultrashort pulses @xmath13 where @xmath14 describes the shape of each pulse , @xmath15 is the temporal spacing of the pulses and @xmath16 is their relative phase . in fourier space",
    "this train of pulses corresponds to a comb of @xmath17-function peaks @xmath18 at equispaced frequencies @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the comb spacing and @xmath21 is the carrier envelope offset .",
    "the comb envelope @xmath22 is the fourier transform of the single pulse profile @xmath14 , which is centered at the carrier frequency @xmath23 and has a width of the order of the inverse of the single pulse duration @xmath24 .",
    "since we are interested in generating light at a given frequency @xmath25 , two spectral sections of the comb are selected centered at @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively , and such that their difference @xmath28 is close to @xmath29 . in the following",
    ", we shall see that the width @xmath30 of the two sections is limited by the acceptance bandwidth @xmath31 of the nonlinear crystal as well as by the different group velocity of the two sub - pulses at @xmath32 during the propagation towards the crystal , i.e. the dephasing of the different teeth within each of the two sections .",
    "concerning the latter point , dispersion can be compensated with standard techniques such as chirped mirrors and/or negatively dispersing optical elements , while for the dispersion in the nonlinear crystal the acceptance bandwidth is directly obtained from data available in literature .",
    "we will discuss in the following a possible experimental realization .",
    "we start by assuming a constant nonlinear susceptibility of the crystal equal to @xmath33 , and we neglect source depletion and reflections at the crystal interfaces . as the relative phase between the different teeth within each of the two sections around @xmath32",
    "is assumed to be negligible , the nonlinear polarization inside the crystal can be written as : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the linear refractive index of the nonlinear medium at @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the corresponding wave vector ; @xmath38 is assumed to be real at all frequencies of interest ; the indices @xmath39 and @xmath3 run over the frequency components of the comb .",
    "the fourier transform of ( [ eq : p_2omega ] ) is a comb of @xmath17-function peaks spaced of @xmath40 with a vanishing offset .",
    "the amplitude of the component at the frequency @xmath41 is given by the sum over all pairs @xmath42 such that @xmath43 .",
    "the steady - state amplitude of the cavity field is obtained by solving the wave equation with the source term corresponding to the nonlinear polarization ( [ eq : p_2omega ] ) . as the calculation is somewhat lengthy , the details",
    "are given in the appendix  [ sec : appendix ] , and we here discuss the final result only .",
    "the frequency spectrum of the cavity field has the same discrete structure of the nonlinear polarization . on the internal side of the output mirror",
    ", the amplitude of the @xmath44 component has the explicit expression : @xmath45\\ell}-1 }   { k_p^2-k_{\\rm nl}^{(j , m)\\;2}}\\,\\chi{^{(2)}}\\,e^*(\\omega_{m})\\,e(\\omega_{j } ) , \\nonumber   \\ ] ] where the optical length of the cavity is defined as usual as @xmath46 and @xmath47 gives the position of the front interface of the crystal .",
    "the denominator of the first fraction on the rhs accounts for resonance effects due to the presence of the cavity whose modes are determined by the usual round - trip condition @xmath48 ( @xmath49 integer ) . for a weak transmittivity @xmath50 of the output mirror , and in the absence of significant losses in the cavity , the damping rate @xmath51 of the cavity modes is determined by the finite transmittivity @xmath52 of the output mirror @xmath53 .",
    "the fraction in the sum takes into account the phase - matching effects associated with the refractive index dispersion of the nonlinear crystal .",
    "because of dispersion , the polarization at @xmath54 produced by the different pairs @xmath42 has a different wave vector @xmath55 .",
    "this wave vector has to be close to the one of the radiation to be generated @xmath56 for the dfg process to be efficient .",
    "physical insight on the spectrum of the generated light can be found by rewriting the amplitude of the output beam @xmath57 in terms of the field @xmath58 that would be generated by the same crystal in a single - pass geometry .",
    "the same calculations ( see appendix  [ sec : appendix ] ) that led to ( [ eq : electrfield0 ] ) give the following expression : @xmath59 for @xmath50 , one sees that the output power which is obtained under the resonance condition is a factor @xmath60 larger than the one that would be obtained in a single - pass geometry . if the non - radiative cavity losses @xmath61 are not negligible , the output power is a factor @xmath62 weaker .",
    "as we are interested in obtaining a single - frequency output beam , a single tooth out of the comb of frequencies actually present in the nonlinear polarization spectrum has to be singled out by the action of the cavity .",
    "this has therefore to be designed in such a way that only the component at the desired frequency @xmath10 is on resonance with a cavity mode , while all the others , being off - resonance , are suppressed . to this purpose",
    ", several strategies can be adopted .",
    "the most trivial one consists in choosing the cavity free spectral range and the repetition rate of the source laser to be non - commensurate to avoid multiple exact resonances @xcite .",
    "another option is , in analogy with standard laser techniques , to insert in the cavity some frequency discriminators , like fabry - perot etalons , which introduce additional losses to suppress unwanted resonances keeping the resonant enhancement only for the mode of interest .    as an illustrative example",
    ", we consider a resonator with a free spectral range ( fsr ) of 1,13ghz pumped by a femtosecond laser with a repetition rate @xmath63 of 1ghz and containing two uncoated glass etalons 410@xmath6 m and 2.2 mm thick .",
    "the two etalons have unity transmission at @xmath7 , and the finesse of the cavity is 1570 and limited by the transmissivity of the output mirror @xmath64=0.2% .",
    "the polarization of the non - linear crystal is a @xmath65 profile with fwhm of 6.4thz and centered on @xmath7 .",
    "figure [ fig : spectrum ] represents the output spectrum for these specific parameter values with the optical power normalized to field at @xmath7 generated in single - pass dfg .",
    "the inset shows that the resonator not only enhances the component at @xmath7 but also suppresses the power on most of the other , non - resonant , components . with the parameters considered here ,",
    "the power at @xmath7 is increased by a factor 2000 with respect to the single - pass conversion , and the sum of the power on all non - resonant modes amounts to 13% of that at @xmath7 .",
    "this means that the output is indeed a continuous wave field at frequency @xmath7 superposed to a small , amplitude modulation at frequency @xmath1 and its higher harmonics with a bandwidth of the order of the frequency spread of the dfg polarization , of the order of @xmath66 .",
    "giving a realistic estimate of the power generated by the optical rectifier requires stringent assumptions on the experimental parameters @xcite .",
    "we examine , for instance , the case in which the optical rectifier synthesizes radiation at 2.8@xmath6 m . we consider the spectral windows at 680 and 900 nm form a mode - locked laser , each having a spectral width of 3thz equal to the acceptance bandwidth of the non - linear crystal . supposing that the model - locked laser has 1ghz repetition rate and delivers both at 680 and 900 nm 30pj per pulse @xcite , that the non - linear medium is a 1 mm crystal of periodically poled lithium niobate ( ppln ) , neglecting losses @xcite , then the single - pass dfg energy can be estimated to be of 0.2pj per pulse . with the given repetition rate @xmath1=1ghz and spectral width for the envelope of the dfg radiation , the peak single - pass conversion to 2.8@xmath6",
    "m is about 35nw per frequency component .",
    "the use of the optical rectifier increases the output power at @xmath7 to 70@xmath6w .",
    "this value is comparable @xcite or larger @xcite than the power produced by alternative systems with analogous spectral characteristics .",
    "let s now summarize the main advantages offered by the proposed optical rectifier as a frequency synthesizer of continuous wave optical fields .",
    "it is well known that the frequency components generated by dfg between separate spectral regions of one mode - locked laser depend only on the repetition rate @xmath1 and not on the carrier envelope offset frequency @xmath2 .",
    "this makes its stabilization unnecessary and therefore reduces the complexity of the system .",
    "another common feature of dfg processes with mode - locked lasers is that the amplitude at the frequency @xmath67 is not determined by a single @xmath68 pair , but from the constructive interference of all the pairs @xmath69 that lie within the acceptance window of the nonlinear crystal @xmath70 . if we denote by @xmath71 the pair of components which gives exact phase matching @xmath72 and we linearize the dispersion of the refractive index around its values respectively at @xmath73 and @xmath74 , the number @xmath75 of pairs which are actually phase matched can be estimated to be of the order of : @xmath76 the power of the generated beam is therefore a factor @xmath77 larger than the one that would be generated by a single @xmath68 pair .    in our cavity - enhanced set - up ,",
    "the power of the generated light is further enhanced by a factor proportional to the finesse . moreover , suppressing the power on all frequency components available from the polarization but @xmath7 , the optical rectifier allows for a strong reduction on the amplitude modulation of the generated field .",
    "this results into a reduction of the noise spectrum of the beatnote signal between the synthesized frequency and that to be measured @xcite .",
    "this should lead to high contrast measurements even with relatively weak fields .    in conventional lasers",
    "the coherence properties of the generated light are determined by the spontaneous symmetry breaking induced by coupling between the cavity and the gain medium @xcite .",
    "however , it is worth noting that in our optical rectifier the coherence properties of the output are determined by the ones of the mode - locked laser and , in particular , through its repetition rate .",
    "the cavity plays only the role of selector among the pairs of frequencies allowed by difference frequency generation , enhancing one single frequency while suppressing the others .    from the practical point of view",
    ", the spectrum of the pumping mode - locked laser has to be taken into account in the choice of the cavity parameters . neglecting all cavity losses but",
    "the output mirror , equation ( [ eq : electrfieldt2 ] ) shows that output power increases as @xmath78 .",
    "this holds true in the most usual case when the linewidth of each frequency component of the mode - locked laser is narrower than the linewidth of the cavity mode .",
    "by increasing the finesse of the cavity beyond this condition one can easily prove that the circulating power now increases proportionally to 1/t , while the output power tends to a constant .",
    "in conclusion , we presented a novel scheme for synthesizing continuous wave and single - frequency optical beams from pulsed mode - locked lasers . we believe that this scheme for optical rectification holds promises for applications to optical frequency metrology and direct synthesis of cw optical fields from radiofrequencies .",
    "the continuous wave optical synthesizer would be composed by a mode - locked laser spanning the spectral regions to pump the dfg , with the repetition rate stabilized to a radiofrequency reference , followed by the optical rectifier tuned to the frequency to be generated .",
