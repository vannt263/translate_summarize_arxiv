    "high resolution spectra of h  i ly@xmath0 lines from the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) have proven to be useful for many purposes .",
    "hydrogen and deuterium atoms in the interstellar medium produce absorption features in stellar ly@xmath0 spectra that can be analyzed to yield information about the ism . of particular interest",
    "are measurements of the local deuterium - to - hydrogen ( d / h ) ratio , which has been a focal point for these analyses in the past due to its relevance for cosmology and galactic chemical evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "in addition to the ism absorption , some of the ly@xmath0 spectra of nearby stars also show absorption from the outer heliosphere and/or absorption from the analogous `` astrospheres '' surrounding the observed stars @xcite .",
    "the region of the outer heliosphere that is probed by the heliospheric absorption is not observable by any other means .",
    "astrospheres and the solar - like stellar winds that are implied by their presence are also otherwise completely undetectable .",
    "thus , the heliospheric and astrospheric diagnostics provided by the hst ly@xmath0 absorption spectra are truly unique .",
    "@xcite provides a complete review of past results concerning the analysis of the heliospheric and astrospheric absorption .",
    "the most important quantitative results from the astrospheric ly@xmath0 absorption analyses are the first measurements of mass loss rates for solar - like stars , although they could also in principle be used as ism diagnostics @xcite . collectively , these measurements suggest that mass loss increases with magnetic activity and decreases with stellar age , suggesting that the solar wind was stronger in the past @xcite .",
    "in addition to its obvious importance for solar / stellar astronomy , the implied stronger wind of the young sun could have important ramifications for our understanding of the evolution of planetary atmospheres in our solar system .",
    "however , the inferred mass - loss / activity and mass - loss / age relations for cool main sequence stars are based on only six astrospheric detections .",
    "many more detections are necessary to confirm and refine these results .    motivated primarily by the need to increase the number of astrospheric detections , we have searched the hst archive for additional ly@xmath0 spectra of nearby cool stars .",
    "we find 33 new data sets to analyze .",
    "in addition to identifying lines of sight with detectable astrospheric absorption , we also analyze these data for other purposes : ( 1 ) to search for heliospheric ly@xmath0 absorption , ( 2 ) to measure ism h  i column densities , and ( 3 ) to measure chromospheric ly@xmath0 fluxes corrected for ism , heliospheric , and astrospheric absorption . by combining our results with previous measurements ,",
    "we ultimately provide here a complete list of ly@xmath0 measurements based on high resolution hst spectra of nearby cool stars , and we discuss some implications of these results .",
    "in the top section of table  1 , we list 29 lines of sight with hst ly@xmath0 spectra that have been analyzed and published .",
    "( see the references listed in the last column of the table . ) except for 36  oph  a , all these spectra were taken by the goddard high resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) instrument .",
    "the 36  oph  a spectrum was taken by the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) , which replaced the ghrs on hst in 1997 .",
    "the eighth column of table  1 lists the ism h  i column densities ( in @xmath3 ) measured towards the observed stars .",
    "the ninth column indicates whether high resolution hst spectra of the interstellar mg  ii h & k absorption lines ( at 2803    and 2796   , respectively ) are available to provide information on the velocity structure of the ism .",
    "when available , this information is always taken into account in the analysis of the broad , saturated ism ly@xmath0 absorption , which increases confidence in the results of the complex ly@xmath0 analysis .",
    "note that only the highest resolution gratings of the ghrs and stis instruments , with @xmath4 , can resolve the narrow mg  ii absorption lines , so column  8 of table  1 does not acknowledge the presence of low ( @xmath5 ) or moderate ( @xmath6 ) resolution spectra of mg  ii in the hst archive .",
    "the tenth and eleventh columns of table  1 indicate which ly@xmath0 spectra show the presence of heliospheric absorption and astrospheric absorption , in addition to the ism absorption .",
    "marginal detections are indicated by question marks . whether a detection is marginal or not is based on our own determination , after inspecting and working with the data ourselves . @xcite and @xcite",
    "find evidence for weak heliospheric absorption towards the similar capella and g191-b2b lines of sight , but these claims rely on subtle statistical arguments rather than clearly visible excess absorption , so we do not consider these to be detections for our purposes here .    for eight of the stars in table  1 , the tenth and eleventh columns are left blank because the ly@xmath0 spectra are moderate resolution ghrs spectra , which generally lack sufficient spectral resolution to allow a clear detection of heliospheric or astrospheric absorption .",
    "the exception is sirius , which shows detectable heliospheric absorption in its moderate resolution ghrs spectrum @xcite .",
    "this detection owes its success in large part to the extremely low ism h  i column density for that line of sight , which minimizes the ism absorption and makes the heliospheric absorption easier to detect .",
    "nearly all of the stars listed in table  1 are cool stars , but there are a few exceptions : sirius , hz  43 , g191-b2b , feige  24 , and gd  246 .",
    "these stars will not have solar - like astrospheres around them since they do not have solar - like winds .",
    "for this reason , column 11 is left blank for these stars .",
    "our goal here is to find additional ly@xmath0 spectra lurking in the hst archive to provide new measurements of ism absorption , and hopefully new detections of heliospheric and astrospheric absorption .",
    "we confine our attention to lines of sight shorter than 100  pc .",
    "longer lines of sight will almost certainly have ism h  i column densities too high and ism ly@xmath0 absorption too broad to hope to detect any heliospheric or astrospheric absorption .",
    "we also restrict ourselves to observations of cool stars of spectral type f and later , which will presumably have coronal winds analogous to that of the sun and will therefore potentially have detectable astrospheres analogous to the sun s heliosphere .",
    "finally , the ly@xmath0 spectra must have sufficient spectral resolution to allow for a reasonably confident identification of heliospheric and astrospheric absorption , if present .",
    "ideally , this means high resolution spectra with either the ghrs ech - a grating or the stis e140h grating , which are both capable of fully resolving the h  i and d  i ly@xmath0 absorption line profiles .",
    "unfortunately , all the ech - a and e140h data that fit our criteria have already been analyzed and are listed in the top section of table  1 . as mentioned above , the @xmath6 moderate resolution ghrs spectra do not generally have sufficient spectral resolution for our purposes . in order to clearly identify the presence of heliospheric and astrospheric absorption , which is",
    "always highly blended with the ism absorption , it is necessary to use the information provided by the ism d  i absorption profile to constrain the ism h  i absorption , so resolving d  i is crucial ( see  4.2 ) .    although moderate resolution ghrs spectra do not meet our resolution requirements , moderate resolution stis spectra with the e140 m grating _ are _ acceptable .",
    "the stis e140 m spectra have @xmath7 , which is sufficient to mostly resolve the d  i absorption profile .",
    "furthermore , stis e140 m spectra cover a wide wavelength range of 11501730   , meaning that there are many e140 m spectra in the hst archive taken to observe different emission lines within e140 m s broad spectral range that will nevertheless also include the ly@xmath0 line at 1216    in which we are interested .",
    "we have searched the hst archive for previously unanalyzed stis e140 m spectra of cool stars within 100  pc , and in the bottom portion of table  1 we list the 33 lines of sight observed by hst that meet these criteria .",
    "all observations except those of @xmath1  boo  a and 61  vir were performed through the @xmath8 aperture . the @xmath1  boo  a and 61  vir data were obtained through the narrower @xmath9 aperture .",
    "the data were reduced using the stis team s calstis software package written in idl @xcite .",
    "the processing includes wavelength calibration using spectra of the calibration lamp taken during the observations , and includes correction for scattered light .",
    "we generally coadd all available e140 m spectra in the archive , with two exceptions . for ad leo",
    ", there are separate data sets on 2000 march 10 and 2002 june 1 .",
    "we choose not to include the latter because the geocoronal ly@xmath0 emission is difficult to remove in those data .",
    "( see  3 for more discussion about the geocoronal emission and its removal . ) for v471  tau , there are three different large data sets . for the sake of simplicity , we choose to reduce only the observations taken on 2000 august 2427 .",
    "figure  1 shows the final processed spectra of all 33 stars , focusing on the ly@xmath0 region .",
    "each spectrum shows a stellar emission line upon which is superimposed a very broad h  i ly@xmath0 absorption feature centered near the rest wavelength of 1215.670   .",
    "the spectra also show narrow d  i ly@xmath0 absorption about @xmath10    from the center of the h  i absorption , except in cases where the h  i absorption is broad enough to obscure the d  i absorption ( see  4.2 ) .",
    "finally , the spectra are contaminated by h  i ly@xmath0 emission from the earth s geocorona , which is shaded in figure  1 .",
    "these geocoronal lines are narrow , and most are conveniently contained within the saturated core of the ism h  i absorption , allowing them to be easily removed . in such cases ,",
    "we remove the geocoronal lines by fitting gaussians to the lines and then subtracting the gaussians from the data . note that the hd  209458 spectrum is the sum of spectra taken at two different times when the geocoronal emission was at different wavelengths , so two gaussians are fitted to the data in this case .    in some cases",
    "the geocoronal emission is blended with the sides of the h  i absorption profile , making the geocoronal subtraction significantly harder and more uncertain ( e.g. , hd  73350 ) . in such instances ,",
    "we still use gaussian fitting to estimate the absorption , but we only fit the side of the emission close to the absorption core and we force the fitted gaussian to be at the expected wavelength , which we know to within about 2 km  s@xmath11 based on the accuracy of the wavelength calibration ( see below ) . nevertheless , the uncertainty in the geocoronal subtraction for these blended cases could be a significant source of systematic error in the analysis of the h  i absorption lines . in all future figures , ly@xmath0 spectra will be shown with the geocoronal emission removed .",
    "although the geocoronal emission is an annoyance when it is blended with the sides of the absorption profile , its presence is actually beneficial when it is fully within the absorption core , because it can be used as a secondary wavelength calibrator .",
    "the data reduction places the spectra in a heliocentric rest frame , which means that the geocoronal emission is centered at the projected velocity of the earth towards the star at the time of observation .",
    "this quantity is known accurately and can be compared with the measured center of the emission , in order to test the wavelength scale . in figure  2",
    ", we plot the velocity discrepancies of the geocoronal emission from their expected locations ( @xmath12 ) for all the newly analyzed stars .",
    "these are all stis e140 m spectra , so this represents an excellent test of the stis e140 m wavelength calibration .",
    "the weighted mean and standard deviation of the data points in figure  2 is @xmath13 km  s@xmath11 .",
    "this result suggests that calstis - processed e140 m spectra are systematically blueshifted by 1.2 km  s@xmath11 from where they should be , at least in the ly@xmath0 spectral region .",
    "the standard calstis data reduction computes a global wavelength offset for the entire stis spectrum from the wavelength calibration images .",
    "perhaps the ly@xmath0 spectral region , which is near the edge of the e140 m grating s spectral coverage , is systematically shifted from the average offset value .",
    "there are also a few individual spectra that show significant discrepancies of up to 4 km  s@xmath11 from the average @xmath14 value",
    ". whatever the cause of the systematic wavelength shift and the scatter around it , we believe that the geocoronal lines provide a better velocity scale , so for all spectra in which a geocoronal emission centroid can be measured , we correct the wavelengths of our spectra using the @xmath14 values in figure  2 .",
    "the d  i ly@xmath0 absorption lines are relatively easy to analyze by themselves .",
    "because they are narrow , a reasonably accurate continuum can be interpolated over these lines and an absorption profile can then be fitted to the d  i lines .",
    "@xcite have already performed these measurements for some of the stars in our sample .",
    "figure  3 shows examples of some of the d  i fits .",
    "the thin solid line shows the assumed background continuum , the dotted lines show the individual absorption components of the fit , and the thick solid line shows the combination of all the components after convolution with the instrumental line spread function ( lsf ) .",
    "the stis e140 m lsf used here is from @xcite .",
    "analyzing the h  i ly@xmath0 absorption is much trickier .",
    "not only is the visible absorption broad and difficult to interpolate over , but ism h  i column densities towards even the nearest stars are high enough for the h  i absorption profile to have extended damping wings .",
    "thus , analyzing the h  i absorption essentially requires first reconstructing the entire stellar ly@xmath0 profile .",
    "this can be done as follows .",
    "the first step is to use a fit to the d  i absorption to infer what the central wavelength and doppler broadening parameter should be for the h  i line .",
    "the ism h  i absorption should presumably have the same centroid velocity as d  i , so @xmath15 , and since past work has demonstrated that h  i and d  i absorption lines in the local ism are dominated by thermal broadening ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , their doppler parameters are related by @xmath16 . with this information , an h  i opacity profile , @xmath17 ( assumed to be a voigt profile ) ,",
    "can be computed for various assumed values of the h  i column density , @xmath18 . for each opacity profile",
    ", we can then reconstruct the wings of the stellar emission line profile by multiplying the data by @xmath19 .",
    "( note that since we are interested in modeling the damping wings rather than the central part of the absorption , the assumed value of @xmath20 is actually unimportant . )    figure  4 shows the results of this exercise using the @xmath1  boo data as an example , with the d  i absorption having been removed .",
    "stellar line profiles are reconstructed assuming ism h  i column densities in the range @xmath21 ( units @xmath3 ) . only the wings of the profile outside the dashed lines",
    "are reconstructed using the opacity profiles computed as described above . in order to estimate the profile in between the dashed lines , we either use a polynomial fit to the wings to interolate between them , or more commonly we use the mg  ii h & k lines to estimate the shape of the central portion of the ly@xmath0 profile .",
    "the justification for this is that ly@xmath0 and the two mg  ii lines are all highly optically thick chromospheric lines that have similar profiles in the solar spectrum @xcite .",
    "table  1 indicates which hst data sets include high resolution mg  ii spectra .",
    "if high resolution mg  ii spectra are not available for a star , we often use the mg  ii profile of a similar star .",
    "( the @xmath1  boo  a mg  ii profiles are the most commonly used surrogates . )      the profile reconstruction technique described in  4.1 results in a family of stellar ly@xmath0 profiles , as in figure  4 , each of which can be used as a starting point for an analysis of the h  i absorption . with each assumed profile , an initial h  i+d  i absorption fit is performed , which is done using a @xmath22 minimization technique @xcite .",
    "all necessary atomic data for the d  i and h  i ly@xmath0 lines are taken from @xcite .",
    "the absorption is convolved with the lsf before comparing with the data , as in the d  i fits in figure  3 . in all our fits involving h  i absorption , we fit h  i and d  i simultaneously and constrain the problem by forcing @xmath15 and @xmath23 . after the initial fit , the assumed stellar profile",
    "is then altered based on the residuals of the fit , and then a second , presumably improved absorption line fit is performed .",
    "additional iterations can be done to further refine the fit . for a simple line of sight with one ism absorption component and no heliospheric or astrospheric absorption ,",
    "the problem is well constrained enough that this iterative process ultimately ends up driving the fit parameters of the single absorption component towards the same solution _ no matter which of the assumed stellar profiles one actually starts out with .",
    "_ however , this is not always the case in more complicated multi - component lines of sight , especially when heliospheric or astrospheric absorption is present ( see * ? ? ?",
    "fortunately , it is possible to constrain the analysis even further by assuming a d / h ratio . using uv spectra from hst and the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ ( fuse ) , a consensus has been reached that the interstellar d / h ratio is invariable within the local bubble .",
    "based on different compilations of measurements , @xcite finds @xmath24 , @xcite quotes @xmath25 , and @xcite computes @xmath26 , with no evidence for significant variation within 100  pc .",
    "since all our targets are located within the local bubble , we simply assume @xmath27 , consistent with the values quoted above . with the addition of this assumption , all three fit parameters of the difficult - to - analyze h  i absorption [ @xmath28 , @xmath20 , and @xmath18 ] are dependent on the much better constrained d",
    "i fit parameters [ @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .",
    "the ism h  i absorption profile is therefore much more tightly constrained , even when multiple ism components are included .",
    "this assumption also means that we do not have to experiment with all the stellar profiles reconstructed as in figure  4 .",
    "we can instead immediately focus on the profile that was constructed assuming the @xmath18 value that the d  i fit suggests should yield @xmath27 . in the case of @xmath1  boo  a that value is @xmath33 , and this profile is emphasized in figure  4 . not having to consider the other profiles as possible starting points for the h  i absorption analysis greatly simplifies what would otherwise be a formidable and time - consuming problem considering the number of spectra that we wish to analyze .    in order to provide the reader with an idea of how h  i+d  i absorption profiles vary under the constraints described above , figure 5",
    "shows profiles computed for a range of column densities , @xmath34 , and for two different doppler parameters , @xmath35 km  s@xmath11 and @xmath36 km  s@xmath11 . with only a few exceptions ,",
    "the range of column densities covers the values observed for the @xmath37 lines of sight listed in table  1 .",
    "the two doppler parameters represent temperatures of @xmath38  k and @xmath39  k , respectively ( in the absence of nonthermal broadening ) , which roughly define the range of temperatures that are generally observed in the local ism ( see  4.4 ) .    in figure 5 ,",
    "the d  i line is clearly narrower for the lower @xmath40 value , and at low column densities the doppler core of the h  i absorption is also narrower , but the far damping wings of the h  i absorption are only dependent on the column density . at the highest column densities shown",
    ", the doppler core of the h  i absorption has been obliterated by the broadening absorption from the damping wings , so nearly all dependence on @xmath40 is lost .",
    "by @xmath41 , the d  i absorption has become saturated and almost completely blended with h  i. thus , the d  i line is no longer very useful for constraining @xmath18 via the @xmath27 assumption .",
    "however , the width of the base of the h  i absorption has become much more sensitive to @xmath18 , so a reasonably accurate h  i column density can still be measured in this high column regime .    the ism velocity structure along a line of sight is something that we take into account in our ly@xmath0 fits , when this information is available .",
    "unfortunately , the thermal width of the d  i line is too large to suggest the presence of any but the most widely separated ism components , and the h  i absorption is naturally far too broad and opaque for these purposes .",
    "the ism mg  ii h & k absorption lines are the most commonly used lines for studying the velocity structure of the local ism , although weaker fe  ii lines observable in near - uv spectra can be useful as well .",
    "the large atomic weights of the mg  ii and fe  ii species mean that the thermal broadening of their ism absorption lines is much lower than for d  i and h  i. in fact , these lines are typically dominated by nonthermal rather than thermal broadening .",
    "thus , when observed at the highest spectral resolution accessible to ghrs or stis , the very narrow mg  ii and fe  ii lines are ideal for indentifying multiple ism velocity components .",
    "table  1 indicates which of our lines of sight have high resolution mg  ii data that can be used to infer the ism velocity structure .",
    "* hereafter rl02 ) have already analyzed these and other data to provide a complete survey of observed ism mg  ii and fe  ii absorption for lines of sight within 100  pc . in cases where multiple ism components are seen",
    ", we use the results of rl02 to constrain multi - component fits to our ly@xmath0 data . in a multi - component ly@xmath0",
    "fit we force the velocity separations of the components to be the same as those seen for mg  ii .",
    "we do not fix the velocities themselves in order to allow the fit to account for possible differences in the wavelength calibrations of the mg  ii and ly@xmath0 spectra , so we allow one component centroid to vary and force the other components to have the appropriate shifts from that component . because the ism components are so highly blended in the broad h  i and d  i lines , our philosophy is to initially assume as many constraints as possible .",
    "thus , initially we force all components to have the same doppler parameter in our fits ( though we do not force a particular value ) , and we also assume that the column density ratios of the individual components are the same as found for mg  ii . if a reasonable fit to the data can not be obtained with these constraints we try relaxing them , the justification being that warm , neutral material within the local bubble is not entirely homogeneous . temperatures and dust depletions within the local ism vary to some extent , resulting in variations in doppler parameters and mg  ii / h  i column density ratios @xcite .",
    "however , all components are always constrained by the deuterium - hydrogen self - consistency requirements described above",
    ".    note that throughout this paper , the `` reasonableness '' of a fit is ultimately assessed by eye .",
    "the fitting process includes the tweaking of the assumed stellar emission profile to maximize the quality of a fit ( see above ) . since this tweaking is not automated , the final value of @xmath22 is in large part dependent on our ability to alter the ly@xmath0 profile in a reasonable fashion .",
    "this ability is imprecise and hard to quantify , so the final value of @xmath22 is of limited usefulness in assessing whether a fit is acceptable , or whether it is necessary to relax certain assumptions in order to obtain a better fit .",
    "thus , we ultimately rely on our own subjective judgment rather than using a certain @xmath22 threshold or some other statistical test .    for 25 of the 33 lines of sight , we are able to adequately fit the ly@xmath0 spectra with only ism absorption .",
    "the resulting fits are shown in figure  6 along with the reconstructed stellar ly@xmath0 profiles . only the total ism absorption is shown in figure  6 .",
    "for the multi - component fits , figure  3 provides an idea of what the absorption contributions from the individual components are like .",
    "( although the figure  3 fits are d  i - only fits , the h  i+d  i fits in figure  6 will not be very different in how they fit the d  i line due to the constraints described above that are imposed on these fits . )    table  2 lists the parameters of these fits , using the i d numbers assigned in table  1 to identify the stars .",
    "the quoted 1@xmath42 uncertainties indicate only the random errors induced in the fits by the noise of the spectra .",
    "there is no attempt to include systematic errors such as those associated with the shape of the assumed stellar line profile , which surely dominate the uncertainty in the analysis .    for the h  i column densities , which are of particular interest for ism studies ,",
    "systematic errors include uncertainties in the assumed d / h value , keeping in mind that for most of our lines of sight the dominant constraint on @xmath18 is @xmath43 .",
    "the uncertainties in the average local bubble d / h values quoted near the beginning of this section are @xmath44% .",
    "when combined with uncertainties related to the reconstructed stellar line profile and the ism velocity structure , we believe that typical uncertainties in the _ total _",
    "h  i column densities listed in table  1 are @xmath45% , or about 0.04 dex in @xmath46 .",
    "( see the notes on the @xmath1  boo analysis in  4.5 for discussion on how such errors might affect detection of heliospheric and astrospheric absorption . ) however , in cases where a good d  i profile is not present in the data , either due to poor s /",
    "n or a high column density that leads to d  i being saturated and blended with h  i ( e.g. , hd  203244 , hd  106516 , hd  128987 , hd  28568 , hd  28205 , hd  28033 , hd  209458 , and @xmath47  cap ) , systematic uncertainties in the @xmath46 values listed in table  1 are probably more like @xmath48  dex .    it should be noted that in multi - component cases , the total h  i column density along a line of sight will be known better than the column densities of the individual components , which are listed in table  2 , because the components are so highly blended that the component h  i column densities will be highly dependent on the assumptions made about the components described above . thus , systematic errors for the @xmath46 values listed in table  2 for the individual components will be even higher than those estimated above for the total h  i column densities . for the multi - component fits , the component numbers listed in table  2 are the same numbers as those used by rl02 . the last column of table  2 indicates which lines of sight are discussed in more detail in  4.5 .",
    "there are three different velocities listed in table  2 that can be compared with the measured ism velocity , @xmath28 : @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 . the @xmath49 quantity indicates the line - of - sight velocity predicted by the local interstellar cloud ( lic ) vector @xcite , which is pointed towards galactic coordinates [ @xmath52 , @xmath53 with a magnitude of 25.7 km  s@xmath11 .",
    "this agrees well with measurements of ism particles moving through the solar system , which suggest a flow directed at coordinates [ @xmath54 , @xmath55 at a speed of 26.3 km  s@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "however , for lines of sight near the galactic center direction , the so - called g cloud vector of @xcite can be a better predictor of ism absorption line velocities , so the @xmath50 quantity indicates the velocities suggested by this vector . a sky map from @xcite",
    "provides a crude estimate of the region on the sky where the g cloud vector is applicable , which suggests that the g cloud vector is most likely to apply for stars 33 , 39 , 45 , 46 , and 52 .",
    "it is worth noting that it is very questionable whether the g cloud is truly distinct from the lic and other nearby clouds , or if the apparent different velocity vector in that direction is merely a product of complex velocity gradients within local ism material @xcite . despite this ambiguity ,",
    "the g cloud vector is still useful for our purposes as a predictor of ism velocities in directions where the lic vector clearly does not work .",
    "finally , for lines of sight that have mg  ii measurements , we also list in table  2 the mg  ii velocities from rl02 , @xmath51 , although for @xmath56  peg and @xmath47  cap we choose to quote the fe  ii velocities instead ( see  4.5 ) .",
    "the null assumption in all our ly@xmath0 analyses is that there is no heliospheric or astrospheric absorption present .",
    "we make every effort to find a reasonable fit to the h  i+d  i ly@xmath0 absorption assuming the presence of only ism absorption .",
    "however , for 8 of our 33 lines of sight we conclude that there is simply no way that the d  i and h  i absorption can be fitted in a self - consistent manner without including additional h  i absorption beyond that from the ism .",
    "the additional h  i absorption component must have a column density too low [ @xmath57 ) ] to produce any absorption in lines from much less abundant species such as d  i , mg  ii , or fe  ii .",
    "it is this excess h  i absorption that we interpret as being from the heliosphere or from the astrospheres surrounding the observed stars .    in our fits to these data in figure  7 , we add a single absorption component to the analysis to represent heliospheric and/or astrospheric absorption .",
    "this component is labeled as `` hs / as '' in table  2 , where the final fit parameters are listed for all our ly@xmath0 fits . in figure  7 , we show the absorption provided only by the ism , the discrepancy with the data indicating the excess absorption that we believe must be coming from hs / as absorption .",
    "past theoretical work has shown that the heliosphere only produces excess absorption on the red side of the ly@xmath0 absorption line , while astrospheric absorption produces excess absorption on the blue side of the line @xcite .",
    "the redshift of heliospheric absorption relative to the ism is mostly due to the deceleration and deflection of h atoms as they cross the bow shock , whereas the corresponding effect for astrospheres results instead in a blueshift since our perspective is from outside the astrosphere rather than inside .",
    "thus , based on the fits in figure  7 , we report and list in table  1 the following new astrospheric absorption detections : ev  lac , 70  oph , @xmath1  boo , 61  vir , @xmath2  eri , hd  128987 , and dk  uma . however , we consider the 61  vir and dk  uma detections to be marginal ( see  4.5 ) .",
    "the new heliospheric absorption detections are : 70  oph , @xmath1  boo , 61  vir , and hd  165185 .",
    "details about the evidence for the presence of the hs / as absorption will be provided in  4.5 for each individual line of sight , but some general comments can be made here .",
    "the most important one is that it is impossible to overstate the importance of the constraints on the ism h  i absorption provided by the d  i absorption . in cases where only heliospheric _ or _ astrospheric absorption is present ( ev  lac , @xmath2  eri , hd  165185 , hd  128987 , and dk  uma ) , the hs /",
    "as absorption produces a significant shift of the h  i absorption centroid away from that suggested by the d  i absorption ( see fig .",
    "if multiple ism components are present , one can try to account for this by allowing the ism components to have different doppler parameters .",
    "given the saturated nature of the h  i absorption , increasing @xmath20 for one component can significantly increase the absorption in this component relative to the others , whereas this will not be the case for the unsaturated d  i line , which is far more affected by the relative column densities of the components than by their relative @xmath31 values .",
    "multiple ism components can therefore in principle induce an apparent shift of the h  i absorption relative to d  i. however , because the ism absorption components are always so highly blended , and because of the stringent deuterium - hydrogen self - consistency constraints described in  4.2 , the relative velocity shift that can be induced in this fashion without resulting in poor fits to either d  i or h  i is limited .    a second source of evidence for hs / as absorption , especially important in cases where _ both _ heliospheric and astrospheric absorption are present ( 70  oph , @xmath1  boo , and 61  vir ) , is the overall width of the base of the h  i absorption . the presence of hs / as absorption makes this width larger than can be explained by ism absorption alone ( see fig .",
    "7 ) . in the h  i column density regime of concern here",
    ", one can try to broaden an ism h  i component either by increasing @xmath20 or @xmath18 .",
    "however the @xmath27 constraint means that it is not possible to greatly increase @xmath18 without producing too much d  i absorption , and the @xmath23 constraint means that increasing @xmath20 too much will eventually make the d  i absorption too broad .    in principle , the stellar ly@xmath0 profiles can be altered to account for the excess hs / as absorption in figure  7 , but this does not work in practice since the alterations necessary to remove the need for the hs / as absorption yield profiles that are completely implausible @xcite .",
    "using @xmath2  eri as an example , changing the stellar profile to fit the data without requiring the existence of the excess h  i absorption seen in figure  7 necessitates the assumption of a profile that decreases from about where it is in figure  7 at 1215.45  (@xmath58 ergs @xmath3",
    "s@xmath11 @xmath11 ) down to zero flux at about 1215.57   .",
    "this is not a reasonable stellar profile .",
    "reasonable alterations to stellar profiles do not include the introduction of extreme profile slopes or zero flux within the emission profile .",
    "note that although we list the parameters for the hs / as components in table  2 for completeness , they are of little use in estimating properties of the heliospheric and/or astrospheric gas . more sophisticated analyses of this excess absorption using hydrodynamic modeling of the heliosphere and astrospheres is required to extract meaningful quantitative information from the heliospheric and astrospheric absorption @xcite , which will be done in a future paper .",
    "we do not bother using separate heliospheric and astrospheric absorption components even when both are clearly present , partly because of the limited usefulness of the fit parameters of these empirical absorption components , and partly because our goal here is simply to infer the presence of the hs / as absorption and illustrate the amount of excess absorption in figure  7 .",
    "the fit parameters listed for the ism absorption components in table  2 provide useful diagnostics for the local ism .",
    "the column densities indicate the average ism h  i densities along the lines of sight when divided by the target distances , the velocities provide information on the ism flow vector , and the doppler parameters indicate the temperature of the gas , which can be estimated by the equation @xmath59 if the small contributions of turbulent velocities to the line broadening are neglected @xcite .",
    "however , interpreting the meaning of these measurements is somewhat problematic unless the velocity structure is known .",
    "the high resolution mg  ii and fe  ii spectra that provide this information are only available for 12 of our 33 lines of sight . since 7 of these 12 sight lines show multiple ism components ,",
    "the prevalence of multiple velocity components is clear .",
    "the presence of unresolved velocity structure can shift the centroid of the ism absorption away from the expected @xmath49 or @xmath50 values , and it can also broaden the absorption lines , thereby artificially increasing the d  i and h  i doppler parameters .    of the 12 lines of sight with mg  ii and/or fe  ii information ,",
    "all but one show an absorption component within 3 km  s@xmath11 of the expected @xmath49 or @xmath50 values , the exception being au  mic ( star # 39 ) .",
    "this comparison is valid whether the measured velocities considered are @xmath28 or @xmath51 , with the exception of @xmath47  cap , for which the @xmath28 velocities are poorly constrained and therefore discrepant ( see  4.5 ) . of the 21 lines of sight without the benefit of the mg  ii or fe  ii data ,",
    "10 show line centroids over 3 km  s@xmath11 from the expected @xmath49/@xmath50 values .",
    "the worse agreement for these sight lines is surely due to unresolved velocity structure , especially considering that the @xmath20 values for 7 of these 10 lines of sight are suspiciously high based on previous work .",
    "previous analyses of high resolution hst spectra , constrained by knowledge of the ism velocity structure , have generally suggested that warm , partially neutral clouds within the local bubble typically have temperatures of @xmath60  k , corresponding to doppler parameters of @xmath61 km  s@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "thus , doppler parameters of @xmath62 km  s@xmath11 are suggestive of possible unresolved velocity components .",
    "( see the notes on the ad  leo analysis in  4.5 for an example of how unresolved velocity structure can artificially increase measured doppler parameters . )",
    "one issue that should be mentioned is that the @xmath20 values reported in table  2 , which are derived from the h  i+d  i fits , are almost always @xmath63 km  s@xmath11 larger than those that we measure from the d  i - only fits [ assuming @xmath23 ] , such as the fits shown in figure  3 .",
    "the most likely explanation for this is that the lsf we are assuming is slightly broader than it should be , meaning that we are overcorrecting for instrumental broadening .",
    "for the two single - component fits in figure  3 ( @xmath1  boo and dk  uma ) , the difference between the pre- and post - convolution fits indicates the extent that the d  i absorption profile is unresolved based on our assumed lsf .",
    "the d  i line is clearly not entirely resolved in the e140 m data , which means that the convolution correction is important and that uncertainties in the lsf will lead to uncertainties in the fit parameters , especially @xmath31 .",
    "this emphasizes the importance of high spectral resolution in the ly@xmath0 analyses .",
    "finally , since we are _ a priori _ assuming a d / h value in our fits , our analysis can not refine the value of the local bubble d / h ratio , but we can at least say that our success in fitting the data in figures  6 and 7 indicates that the ly@xmath0 data analyzed here are all consistent with the assumed value of @xmath27 .",
    "we here provide comments on some of the individual lines of sight that have been analyzed .",
    "these include not only notes of particular interest about the lines of sight , but also in some cases details about how multiple ism components were constrained and especially the precise evidence for heliospheric and astrospheric absorption , when present .",
    "the comments frequently refer to information listed in tables 1 and 2 .    ad leo ( # 31 ) : : :    this line of sight is notable for having a remarkably high ism h  i    column density , @xmath65 , given its very    short distance of 4.69  pc .",
    "the implied average density of    @xmath66 @xmath67 is to our    knowledge the highest average density yet measured for any line of    sight within 100  pc ( i.e. , within the local bubble ) , being slightly    above the @xmath68 @xmath67 value    towards hd  82558 ( see table  1 ) .",
    "the large @xmath20    value of the fit and the discrepancy between    @xmath28 and the expected @xmath49    velocity strongly imply the presence of multiple ism components .",
    "there    are no high resolution mg  ii spectra available to verify this , but in    figure  8 we show an alternative fit to the data where an arbitrary    second ism component is included .",
    "the second component is assumed to    be redshifted by 12 km  s@xmath11 from the primary    component , with a column density a factor of 10 lower than that of the    primary component .",
    "the doppler parameters of the two components are    forced to be identical , and in the fit the doppler parameter of both    components ends up at @xmath36    km  s@xmath11 .",
    "this is a more plausible result than the high    @xmath69 km  s@xmath11 value from    the single component fit , illustrating how the presence of multiple    components can artificially increase measured doppler parameters .",
    "the    primary reason that the figure  6 fit has such a poor    @xmath22 value ( @xmath70 ) is    the very high signal - to - noise ( s / n ) of the data .",
    "the high s / n is a    result of the unusually long 52  ksec exposure time of the coadded hst    spectrum , which was taken as part of an extensive flare monitoring    campaign @xcite .",
    "ev lac ( # 32 ) : : :    figure  7 shows that there is a lot of excess h  i absorption on the    blue side of the line , resulting in the centroid of the h  i absorption    being highly blueshifted with respect to the d  i absorption .",

    "3 ) , we find that we can not fit the data well enough while forcing    the column density ratios of the 3 components to be consistent with    those of the mg  ii fit , so in figure  3 we have allowed the column    density ratios to be different .",
    "this d  i fit predicts a doppler    parameter for the h  i absorption of    @xmath71 km  s@xmath11    [ assuming as always @xmath23 ] ,    implying a very low ism temperature of @xmath72  k ,    consistent with the results of @xcite .",

    "this fit    obviously produces d  i absorption much too broad to fit the d  i line ,    considering the low @xmath74    km  s@xmath11 measurement quoted above from the d  i - only    fit .",
    "thus , the data require the addition of an hs / as component in    order to explain the overly broad h  i absorption .",
    "the best fit in    figure  7 shows excess absorption on both sides of the line , implying    the presence of both heliospheric and astrospheric absorption .",
    "note    that because the blueshifted component  3 is not a strong contributor    to the d  i absorption , it is possible to allow _ only _ that component    to have @xmath73 km  s@xmath11    while still fitting d  i reasonably well . in doing so , component 3    becomes broad enough to account for the excess blue - side h  i    absorption , as shown in figure  9b , meaning that only heliospheric h  i    absorption would be inferred from the data .",

    "there are no mg  ii or    fe  ii spectra to precisely define the ism velocity structure of this    line of sight , but inspection of the d  i absorption reveals that this    is one case where ism velocity components are so widely separated that    evidence for multiple components is apparent even in the broad d  i    line ( see fig .  3 ) .",
    "thus , in figure  3 d  i is fitted with two    components .",

    "thus , the    @xmath51 velocities listed in table  2 for    @xmath47  cap are actually fe  ii velocities .",
    "the h  i column    density for this line of sight , @xmath91 ,    is high enough that d  i is nearly saturated and is almost completely    blended with the h  i absorption .",

    "we believe that the large h  i doppler parameters ,    @xmath92 km  s@xmath11 , and the large    discrepancies between the @xmath28 and    @xmath51 velocities in table  2 are a consequence    of these difficulties and the discrepancies should therefore be    regarded with skepticism .",
    "the 33 new lines of sight that we have analyzed have resulted in 4 new detections of heliospheric ly@xmath0 absorption .",
    "this brings the total number of detections to 8 , if one considers the alpha / proxima cen detections as a single line of sight .",
    "this is a large enough number that we can investigate what the lines of sight that produce detectable absorption have in common .",
    "there are really only two factors that determine whether a line of sight will have detectable heliospheric ly@xmath0 absorption .",
    "one is the ism h  i column density , since a high ism column will mean a broad absorption line that will hide the heliospheric absorption .",
    "the second factor is the orientation of the line of sight through the heliosphere .",
    "this orientation is most simply described by the angle , @xmath93 , between the line of sight and the upwind direction of the ism flow seen by the sun .",
    "this upwind direction has galactic coordinates of @xmath94 , @xmath95 @xcite .    in figure  13",

    "different symbols are used to indicate which lines of sight have detectable heliospheric absorption and which do not .",
    "the detections are nicely separated from the nondetections in this parameter space .",
    "as expected , the lines of sight that yield detections tend to have low @xmath18 values .",
    "it is also clearly easier to detect heliospheric absorption in upwind directions ( @xmath96 ) than in downwind directions ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "models of the heliosphere can explain this behavior quite nicely .",
    "it is in upwind directions that the heliospheric h  i suffers the strongest deceleration at the bow shock @xcite .",
    "thus , the heliospheric absorption in these directions will be shifted away from the ism absorption to the greatest extent , making it easier to detect .",
    "the success of the models in explaining the detection tendencies illustrated in figure  13 is additional strong evidence that heliospheric absorption is indeed the correct interpretation for the red - side excess ly@xmath0 absorption .    for the upwind directions ,",
    "heliospheric absorption is only detected when @xmath98 , but in downwind directions a detection requires @xmath99 .",
    "there simply are not many lines of sight that will have interstellar column densities of @xmath99 .",
    "thus , the downwind detection of heliospheric absorption towards sirius may forever remain unique @xcite .",
    "the properties of a line of sight through the heliosphere are described entirely by the angle @xmath93 only if the heliosphere is precisely axisymmetric",
    ". however , significant deviations from axisymmetry are possible due to latitudinal solar wind variations , an ism magnetic field that is skewed with respect to the ism flow direction , or unstable mhd phenomena near the plane of the heliospheric current sheet @xcite .",
    "there are now enough heliospheric absorption detections to conduct at least a crude investigation into whether there is evidence for any such asymmetries , and this will be a project for the near future .",
    "the 7 new astrospheric detections found here bring the total number of detections up to 13 .",
    "the astrospheric detections are primarily of interest because the astrospheric absorption provides a diagnostic for stellar winds that are otherwise completely undetectable .",
    "mass loss rates have been measured for all of the older detections , and these measurements have been used to infer how winds vary with age and activity for solar - like main sequence stars @xcite .",
    "we are currently measuring mass loss rates using the new astrospheric detections , but these results will have to wait for a future paper .    we can use the new detections to investigate what is common among the lines of sight that have detections , as we did for the heliospheric detections in  5 , but the situation is more complicated in the case of astrospheres .",
    "there are many more factors involved in the detectability of the astrospheric absorption , including the nature of the ism surrounding the star , the total integrated ism h  i column density for the line of sight , the speed and orientation of the ism flow vector seen by the star , and the properties of the stellar wind .",
    "a nondetections of astrospheric absorption could be due to any number of these factors , so it is generally impossible to use nondetections of astrospheric absorption to infer anything about the stellar wind or surrounding ism , unlike what can be done with the nondetections of heliospheric absorption ( see  5 ) .    in figure  14",
    ", we plot the ism column density versus stellar distance for all of the hst - observed lines of sight listed in table  1 .",
    "the hst data points are placed into three categories : lines of sight that yield detections of astrospheric absorption , lines of sight that yield nondetections , and other lines of sight for which a search for astrospheric absorption is not appropriate due to a hot star target or low spectral resolution ( see  2 ) .",

    ", the detection rate is quite high within 10  pc , with 10 of 17 independent sight lines producing detections for a detection rate of 58.8% .",
    "the situation worsens dramatically beyond 10  pc , with only 3 of 31 lines of sight yielding detections , for a detection rate of only 9.7% .",
    "furthermore , 2 of the 3 detections beyond 10  pc are considered only marginal detections ( see table  1 ) .",
    "there are two reasons for the distance dependence of astrospheric detectability .",
    "one is simply that longer lines of sight tend to have higher ism column densities , as shown by figure  14 .",
    "this means that the ism h  i ly@xmath0 absorption will be broader , which can hide the astrospheric absorption .",
    "a second major problem with more distant targets is that there is a high probability that they will be surrounded by hot , ionized ism material with no neutrals , which will therefore inject no h  i into the astrospheres to produce ly@xmath0 absorption .",
    "the local bubble is believed to be mostly filled with this ionized material ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there are regions of warm , partially neutral material embedded within the local bubble , and it just so happens that the sun is located within one of these regions , explaining why even the nearest lines of sight have substantial h  i column densities ( see table  1 )",
    ". however , the further a star is from the sun , the more likely it will be located in the more prevalent ionized ism .",
    "this is evident in figure  14 , which shows that h  i column densities do not increase much beyond 10  pc , and average h  i densities therefore decrease .",
    "since an astrospheric detection requires the presence of neutral material in the ism surrounding the observed star , a detection of astrospheric absorption represents an _ in situ _ detection of neutral ism at the star s location .",
    "thus , the astrospheric detections can in principle be used to crudely map out locations of warm , partially neutral clouds embedded within the local bubble . the 58.8% detection fraction within 10",
    "pc suggests that neutral clouds occupy about 58.8% of space within 10  pc , although in reality this is really just a lower bound since nondetections of astrospheres can be for many reasons other than an ionized surrounding ism ( see above ) .",
    "it must also be noted that the observed targets are preferentially nearby rather than being randomly distributed throughout the volume of space within 10  pc , so the filling fraction lower limit of 0.588 is biased towards shorter distances .",
    "nevertheless , these results clearly suggest that most of the ism within 10  pc is warm , partially neutral gas , which is atypical within the local bubble .    various observations of ism h  i atoms flowing through the heliosphere provide estimates of the h  i density immediately surrounding the sun .",
    "these estimates are typically @xmath100 @xmath67 @xcite . except for the new measurement towards ad  leo ( see  4.5 ) , average line - of - sight densities within 10  pc are always well below this value ( see fig .",
    "14 ) , so crude models of the distribution of gas in the very local ism have typically assumed instead @xmath101 @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "most of the 10  pc lines of sight shown in figure  14 have densities even lower than this , including most of the astrospheric detections .",
    "of particular interest is the @xmath1  boo line of sight .",
    "the mg  ii absorption data show only a single velocity component , with a velocity consistent with the lic vector ( rl02 ) .",
    "since @xmath1  boo is an astrospheric detection , that would suggest that the lic must extend the entire 6.70  pc distance towards @xmath1  boo , but this means that the lic would have an average density of only @xmath102 @xmath67 for this sight line , much lower than the @xmath103 @xmath67 value measured for the lic at the sun s location .",
    "photoionization models of the lic predict that hydrogen ionization should increase and the h  i density therefore decrease towards the edge of the cloud due to less shielding from ionizing radiation ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , but not to the extent that one would expect to see _ this _ large a decrease in an _ average _ line - of - sight density .",
    "there are two alternative explanations for the low average density .",
    "it is possible that there are in fact two separate clouds along the line of sight that just happen to have the same projected velocity , in which case a sizable gap in between the clouds could explain the low average density .",
    "such a situation must be the case for dk  uma if its marginal astrospheric detection is to be believed .",
    "only a single lic mg  ii absorption component is observed towards dk  uma ( rl02 ) , but there is no way that the lic extends the 32.4  pc distance to that star .",
    "the second explanation is that the lic has a substantial amount of subparsec scale patchiness , with the sun being located within a small , high - density patch .",
    "both of these two explanations indicate that the ism velocity structure information provided by mg  ii and fe  ii absorption data may not be sufficient to infer the true character of the lic and other very nearby interstellar material .",
    "it is worth noting that everything said above about the @xmath1  boo sight line also applies to the 36  oph sight line , except that the g cloud vector applies towards 36  oph instead of the lic vector .",
    "both @xmath0  cen and 36  oph are g cloud lines of sight with astrospheric detections and with mg  ii spectra that show only a single g cloud component . however , the implied average h  i densities towards these stars are very different : @xmath104 @xmath67 and @xmath105 @xmath67 , respectively .",
    "thus , the nearby ism in the direction where the g cloud vector applies appears to be just as inhomogeneous as the @xmath1  boo line of sight , despite the apparent simplicity of the mg  ii velocity structure .    with only 3 astrospheric detections beyond 10  pc , and with 2 of them being marginal detections",
    ", it is harder to infer general properties of the ism beyond 10  pc from these results .",
    "the low detection fraction is a serious problem for potential observational searches for astrospheric absorption beyond 10  pc .",
    "in addition to our desire to use astrospheres to probe the ism beyond 10  pc , the stellar wind research would also benefit from more distant detections , since there are many classes of stars that do not have many representatives within 10  pc . if the goal is to investigate what astrospheric absorption and stellar winds are like for giants or young , solar - like g stars , for example , it is necessary to look beyond 10  pc to find targets .",
    "if astrospheres could be detected from the ground , an extensive observing program could be proposed and a low @xmath106% detection fraction tolerated , but this is not practical when the only instrument capable of detecting the astrospheres is the uv spectrograph on board hst . for the time being , this point may be moot .",
    "the apparent recent demise of the stis instrument in 2004 august means that no new high resolution ly@xmath0 spectra will be possible for the foreseeable future .",
    "the h  i ly@xmath0 line is one of the strongest and most important emission lines from the upper chromospheres of cool stars .",
    "however , the very strong ism absorption that is always present in observations of this line makes measuring reliable line fluxes difficult ( landsman & simon 1993 ) . in order to measure an accurate line flux",
    ", a high resolution spectrum must be obtained that resolves the line profile , and then the intrinsic stellar profile must be reconstructed using the kind of time - consuming analysis technique described in  4 . due to these complications ,",
    "more attention has been given to other chromospheric diagnostics , such as the mg  ii h & k lines .",
    "since relatively little has been done with ly@xmath0 measurements in the past , we believe it is worthwhile to see how our ism - corrected ly@xmath0 fluxes correlate with other , more popular activity diagnostics .",
    "we use the reconstructed ly@xmath0 profiles shown in figures  6 and 7 to measure integrated ly@xmath0 fluxes for our stars , and these fluxes are listed in table  3 ( in ergs  @xmath3  s@xmath11 ) , along with fluxes measured from previously analyzed data ( see references in table  1 ) . for capella ( # 13 ) and hr  1099 ( # 21 )",
    ", the fluxes are divided between the two unresolved stars of these binaries .",
    "the division was made during the absorption analysis for capella @xcite , while for hr  1099 we assume the division between the stars is the same for ly@xmath0 as it is for the mg  ii lines @xcite .",
    "many of the ly@xmath0 profiles in figures 6 and 7 have self - reversals near line center .",
    "this is due to the frequent use of the mg  ii h & k lines to provide an initial guess for the shape of the ly@xmath0 profile .",
    "however , it should be emphasized that the exact line shape should not be considered to be terribly precise , especially the parts of the line profile that lie above the saturated h  i absorption core where the data provide absolutely no information on the profile .",
    "uncertainties in the integrated line fluxes in table  3 will generally be larger for the lines of sight with higher ism column densities since the correction for absorbed flux will generally be higher in those cases , but a typical average error for the fluxes in table  3 is of order 20% .",
    "coronal x - ray and chromospheric mg  ii fluxes are also listed in table  3 for comparison with the ly@xmath0 fluxes .",

    "these data will be discussed in detail in a future paper , but we can report here that 70  oph  a and 36  oph  a contribute 60.4% and 58.2% of the fluxes of these binaries , respectively , so these results are used to modify the rass fluxes in table  3 .",
    "the mg  ii fluxes in table  3 are combined fluxes of the h & k lines .",
    "most of the fluxes are measured from hst spectra .",
    "although many of the ism mg  ii lines are discussed and analyzed by rl02 , and some of the references in table  1 also discuss mg  ii spectra , emission line fluxes have not usually been reported so we generally have to measure these fluxes ourselves .",
    "however , we use the measurements of @xcite and @xcite for capella ( # 13 ) and hr  1099 ( # 21 ) , respectively .",
    "the chromospheric mg  ii emission line lies in the middle of a broad photospheric absorption line .",
    "it is difficult to know what the profile of the absorption line is underneath the chromospheric emission line .",
    "however , we measure our mg  ii fluxes by simply integrating the fluxes of the emission line without trying to correct for any continuum that may be underneath the lines ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this basically assumes that the photospheric absorption is broad and saturated underneath the line .",
    "this assumption will be a significant source of uncertainty ( @xmath110% ) only for the f stars in our sample , which have the strongest photospheric uv continua .",
    "for those stars without high or moderate resolution hst spectra of mg  ii , we look for high resolution iue spectra that can be used to measure mg  ii fluxes .",
    "fluxes measured from iue data are flagged in table  3 . in all our mg  ii measurements we try to remove ism absorption before making the flux measurements .",
    "this is difficult in high resolution iue or moderate resolution hst spectra , since the narrow ism lines are not well resolved .",
    "it is impossible in low resolution iue spectra , which do not even have sufficient resolution to separate the two mg  ii lines , so low resolution iue spectra are not used here .    in order to convert measured fluxes to surface fluxes",

    ". references in the table indicate the sources of the periods .",
    "most are genuine photometric periods , but some are estimated from ca  ii measurements and a known ca  ii - rotation relation .",

    "in addition to plotting the stellar data listed in table  3 , we also add a solar data point to these figures .",
    "we assume a solar ly@xmath0 flux of @xmath111 ergs @xmath3 s@xmath11 , the midpoint of a range quoted by @xcite .",
    "a figure in @xcite implies that quiescent solar mg  ii k fluxes are about 1.6 times larger than ly@xmath0 .",

    "figures 15a - c show separate least squares fits to the f  v+g  v , k  v , and giant ( iii ) stars , in addition to fits to all the stars combined .",
    "we combine the f  v stars with the g  v stars since the few f  v stars are all late f stars and these data points are basically consistent with the more numerous g stars .",
    "there are not enough subgiants ( iv ) and m  v stars to justify making separate fits to those data . in order to estimate uncertainties in the fit parameters , we use a monte carlo method . for a large number of trials",
    ", we randomly vary the data points within assumed error bars , conduct new fits for each of these trials , and see how much the fit parameters vary .",
    "the assumed error bars are estimated as follows .",
    "the biggest source of uncertainty in the fluxes is generally target variability rather than measurement uncertainty .",
    "@xcite estimates that _ rosat _ pspc fluxes should cover a range of about a factor of 4 during solar - like activity cycles , so we assume 0.3  dex uncertainties for the @xmath114 values .",
    "the solar ly@xmath0 flux range quoted by @xcite represents a @xmath115% variation from the median value due to solar cycle and rotational variability .",
    "we assume this result roughly applies to the mg  ii fluxes as well and therefore estimate 0.08  dex uncertainties for @xmath116 .",
    "combining this uncertainty with the previously quoted @xmath117% measurement uncertainty for the ly@xmath0 fluxes leads us to assume 30% ( 0.11  dex ) uncertainties for @xmath118 .",

    "table  4 lists the resulting fit parameters and 1@xmath42 uncertainties for all the fits in figures  15a - c .    although ly@xmath0 and mg  ii are both broadly called chromospheric lines , the relations between @xmath118 and @xmath116 in figure  15b are not quite linear . for example",
    ", the power law index for the f  v+g  v stars quoted in table  4 is @xmath120 .",
    "this is well below 1 and suggests that the ly@xmath0 flux increases more rapidly with activity than mg  ii .",

    ", we find @xmath123 while @xcite quotes @xmath124 .",
    "since higher temperature lines are known to exhibit stronger increases when plotted as a function of any activity diagnostic , these results suggest that the ly@xmath0 line is formed at somewhat hotter temperatures than mg  ii , consistent with the predictions of atmospheric models @xcite . it is interesting that the @xmath125 relation of the giant stars appears to be noticeably more linear than for the dwarfs , and surprisingly tight considering the diverse makeup of this group of stars .",
    "@xcite quote a power law index of @xmath126 in their plot of c  ii fluxes versus @xmath119 for a selection of solar - like g stars .",
    "this is somewhat steeper than our analogous @xmath127 relation , which has a power law of @xmath128 ( see table  4 ) .",
    "this suggests that the ly@xmath0 lines are formed at temperatures cooler than c  ii , and therefore somewhere in between the mg  ii and c  ii line formation temperatures .",
    "the k dwarf relations in figures  15a and 15c are reasonably tight , but this is not the case in 15b .",
    "the k star data points in figure  15b show a lot of scatter , with the two largest discrepancies being the two latest type stars , 61  cyg  a and @xmath129  ind ( both k5  v ) .",
    "given that the two m dwarfs in the figure are also discrepant in the same sense , perhaps the relation between mg  ii and ly@xmath0 undergoes a drastic change for stars with spectral types later than early k. it is also interesting to note that the k dwarf power law relation in figure  15a is noticeably steeper than that of the g star relation , while in figure  15c it is noticeably shallower .",
    "the implication is that for a given increase in rotation , the chromospheric and coronal emission from k stars increases less than that of g stars , but for a given increase in chromospheric emission the x - ray fluxes of k stars increase _ more _ than the g stars .",
    "the last panel of figure  15 compares our hst ly@xmath0 fluxes with previous measurements from iue data .",
    "analyzing the ly@xmath0 line in iue spectra is much more difficult than in hst spectra for many reasons .",
    "the s / n is lower , the spectral resolution is poorer , and not only must one correct for ism absorption but also for geocoronal contamination , which can be severe due to the much larger apertures of iue compared with hst .",

    "the agreement between the iue and hst fluxes is reasonably good .",
    "some of the scatter could be due to real stellar variability .",
    "for the lower fluxes , the iue measurements tend to be systematically higher than suggested by hst , which may be due to inaccuracies in the iue s flux calibration at ly@xmath0 or due to the difficulties in subtracting the geocoronal signal .",

    "2 . : :    our analysis of the d  i and h  i ly@xmath0 absorption    lines has led to 4 new detections of heliospheric    ly@xmath0 absorption ( 70  oph , @xmath1  boo ,    61  vir , and hd  165185 ) , bringing the total number of detections to 8 .",
    "we find 7 new astrospheric detections ( ev  lac , 70  oph ,    @xmath1  boo , 61  vir , @xmath2  eri , hd  128987 ,    and dk  uma ) , although we consider the 61  vir and dk  uma detections to    be marginal .",
    "this brings the total number of detected astrospheres to    13 .",
    ": :    we have measured interstellar h  i column densities for all 33 lines of    sight , which are listed in tables  1 and 2 . of particular interest are    the surprisingly high column densities towards ad  leo    [ @xmath65 ] and hd  203244    [ @xmath87 ] . for the short 4.69  pc line of    sight to ad  leo , the suggested average density of    @xmath66 @xmath67 represents a    new high for a local bubble line of sight .",
    "the rarity of    @xmath133 lines of sight within the local    bubble implies that detections of column densities this high are    probably due to compact clouds that likely have densities well above    the @xmath88 @xmath67 values    believed to apply to the very local ism within 10  pc .",
    "4 . : :    when plotting ism h  i column densities versus @xmath93 ,    the angle between the line of sight and the upwind direction of the    ism flow , the heliospheric detections are nicely separated from the    nondetections .",
    "only lines of sight with low ism h  i column densities    have detected heliospheric absorption , and it is much easier to detect    the heliospheric absorption in upwind directions ( i.e. ,    @xmath134 ) . in the most upwind directions , an    ism column of @xmath135 is required to    detect heliospheric absorption , while in downwind directions one must    have @xmath136 . this behavior is    consistent with expectations from heliospheric models and represents    further strong evidence in support of the heliospheric interpretation    of the excess red - side ly@xmath0 absorption . 5 . : :    within 10  pc , 10 of the 17 analyzed hst lines of sight have yielded    detections of astrospheric absorption , for a detection rate of 58.8% .",
    "since the presence of h  i in the surrounding ism is one necessary    ingredient for an astrospheric detection , the 58.8% detection fraction    represents a lower limit for the filling factor of neutral ism    material within 10  pc , meaning that neutral hydrogen must be present    in most of the ism within 10  pc .",
    "however , beyond 10  pc only 3 of 31    hst lines of sight have astrospheric detections , for a much lower    detection rate of 9.7% .",
    "some of this difference is due to generally    higher ism h  i column densities for longer lines of sight , which    results in broader ism absorption that can hide the astrospheric    signal .",
    "however , beyond 10  pc most of the stars are probably    surrounded by the hot , ionized ism material that is believed to fill    most of the local bubble , and this will account for many nondetections    of astrospheric absorption beyond 10  pc .",
    "6 . : :    our ly@xmath0 absorption analyses requires the    reconstruction of intrinsic stellar ly@xmath0 emission    lines .",
    "we use these lines to measure chromospheric h  i    ly@xmath0 fluxes for our sample of stars , which are    corrected for ism absorption .",
    "we correlate these fluxes with coronal    x - ray and chromospheric mg  ii fluxes , and we also study the dependence    of ly@xmath0 emission on rotation period .",
    "we present in    table  4 the derived relations for various classes of stars .",

    "<S> we search the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) archive for previously unanalyzed observations of stellar h  i ly@xmath0 emission lines , our primary purpose being to look for new detections of ly@xmath0 absorption from the outer heliosphere , and to also search for analogous absorption from the astrospheres surrounding the observed stars . </S>",
    "<S> the astrospheric absorption is of particular interest because it can be used to study solar - like stellar winds that are otherwise undetectable . </S>",
    "<S> we find and analyze 33 hst ly@xmath0 spectra in the archive . </S>",
    "<S> all the spectra were taken with the e140 m grating of the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) instrument on board hst . </S>",
    "<S> the hst / stis spectra yield 4 new detections of heliospheric absorption ( 70  oph , @xmath1  boo , 61  vir , and hd  165185 ) and 7 new detections of astrospheric absorption ( ev  lac , 70  oph , @xmath1  boo , 61  vir , @xmath2  eri , hd  128987 , and dk  uma ) , doubling the previous number of heliospheric and astrospheric detections . when combined with previous results , 10 of 17 lines of sight within 10  pc yield detections of astrospheric absorption . </S>",
    "<S> this high detection fraction implies that most of the ism within 10  pc must be at least partially neutral , since the presence of h  i within the ism surrounding the observed star is necessary for an astrospheric detection . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the detection percentage is only 9.7% ( 3 out of 31 ) for stars beyond 10  pc . </S>",
    "<S> our ly@xmath0 analyses provide measurements of ism h  i and d  i column densities for all 33 lines of sight , and we discuss some implications of these results . finally , we measure chromospheric ly@xmath0 fluxes from the observed stars . </S>",
    "<S> we use these fluxes to determine how ly@xmath0 flux correlates with coronal x - ray and chromospheric mg  ii emission , and we also study how ly@xmath0 emission depends on stellar rotation . </S>"
