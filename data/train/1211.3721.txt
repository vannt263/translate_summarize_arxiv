    "the extremely precise photometry and nearly continuous observations provided by the _ kepler _ satellite have led to the discovery of a number of transiting planetary systems around stellar binaries . at the time of this writing ,",

    "2012 , kostov et al .",
    "the stars in these systems have masses of order of the mass of the sun or smaller , and the planets have radii ranging from 3 earth radii ( kepler-47b ) to 0.76 jupiter radii ( kepler-34b ) .    by virtue of their detection methods , all the kepler circumbinary systems",
    "have highly aligned planetary and stellar orbits , with the mutual orbital inclinations constrained between @xmath0 ( for kepler-38b ) and @xmath1 ( kepler-34b and kepler-35b ) . in kepler-16 ,",
    "measurement of the rossiter - mclaughlin effect further indicates that the spin of the primary is aligned with the orbital angular momentum of the binary ( winn et al .",
    "a natural question arises : do misaligned ( @xmath2 ) circumbinary planetary systems exist ?",
    "if so , under what conditions can they form ?",
    "one might expect that circumbinary systems naturally form with highly aligned orbits , since the associated orbital angular momenta originate from the protostellar cores .",
    "however , several lines of evidence suggest that misaligned configurations may be present in some systems : ( i ) solar - type main - sequence binaries with large separations ( @xmath3  au ) often have a rotation axis misaligned relative to the orbital angular momentum ( hale 1994 ) .",
    "misalignments are also observed in some short - period binaries , such as di hercules ( with orbital period of 10 days ; albrecht et al . 2009",
    "; see also albrecht et al .",

    "\\(ii ) some binary young stellar objects ( ysos ) are observed to contain circumstellar disks that are misaligned with the binary orbital plane ( e.g. , stapelfeldt et al .",
    "also , several unresolved ysos or pre - main sequence binaries have jets along different directions , again suggesting misaligned disks ( e.g. , davis , mundt & eislffel 1994 ; roccatagliata et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "\\(iii ) imaging of circumbinary debris disks shows that the disk plane and the binary orbital plane are aligned for some systems ( such as @xmath4 crb , @xmath5 tri and hd 98800 ) , and misaligned for others ( such as 99 herculis , with mutual inclination @xmath6 ; see kennedy et al .",
    "2012a , b ) . also , the pre - main sequence binary kh  15d is surrounded by a precessing circumbinary disk inclined with respect to the binary plane by @xmath7-@xmath8 ( e.g. , winn et al .  2004 ;",
    "chiang & murray - clay 2004 ; capelo et al .",
    "2012 ) , and the fs tauri circumbinary disk appears to be misaligned with the circumstellar disk ( hioki et al .",
    "2011 ) .    while the aforementioned `` misalignments '' may have various origins ( e.g. , dynamical interactions in few body systems ) , in this paper we focus on the possible existence of warped , misaligned disks around proto - stellar binaries .",
    "we consider scenarios for the assembly of circumbinary disks in the context of binary star formation ( section 2 ) .",
    "these scenarios suggest that circumbinary disks may form with misaligned orientations with respect to the binary .",
    "we then study the mutual gravitational interaction between the misaligned disk and the binary ( section 3 ) and the long - term evolution of the binary - disk systems ( section 4 ) .",
    "we discuss our results in section 5 and conclude in section 6 .",
    "binary stars are thought to form by fragmentation inside the collapsing cores / clumps of molecular clouds , either due to turbulent fluctuation in the core ( `` turbulent fragmentation '' ; e.g. , goodwin et al .  2007 ;",
    "offner et al .",
    "2010 ) or due to gravitational instability in the resulting disk ( `` disk fragmentation '' ; e.g. , adams et al .  1989 ; kratter et al .",
    "2008 ) . in the turbulent fragmentation scenario , the binaries form earlier and have initial separations of order 1000  au",
    ". disk fragmentation also leads to binaries with large initial separations ( @xmath9  au ) . in both cases , continued mass accretion and inward migration , either due to binary - disk interactions ( e.g. , artymowicz & lubow 1996 ) or dynamical interactions in few - body systems , are needed in order to produce close ( sub - au ) binaries .",
    "planet formation can take place in the circumbinary disk during or after the binary orbital decay .    in the simplest picture ,",
    "the proto - binary and circumbinary disk rotate in the same direction .",
    "however , molecular clouds and their collapsing cores are turbulent ( see mckee & ostriker 2007 ; klessen 2011 ) .",
    "it is natural that the condensing and accreting cores contain gas which rotates around different directions .",
    "even if the cores are not turbulent , tidal torques between neighboring cores in a crowded star formation region can change the rotation direction of the outer regions of the condensing / accreting cores .",
    "thus the gas that falls onto the central protostellar core and assembles onto the disk at different times may rotate in different directions . such `` chaotic '' star formation has been seen in some numerical simulations ( bate et al .",
    "2003 ) . in this scenario",
    ", it is reasonable to expect a rapidly rotating central proto - stellar core which fragments into a binary , surrounded by a misaligned circumbinary disk which forms as a result of continued gas accretion .",
    "the mutual gravitational interaction between a proto - binary and the circumbinary disk leads to secular evolution of the relative inclination between the disk and the binary plane . in most cases , this interaction , combined with continued mass accretion , tends to reduce the misalignment .",
    "we will address these issues in the next two sections .",

    "disks inclined relative to the binary ( e.g. , papaloizou & terquem 1995 ; bate et al .",

    "theoretical studies of warped disks ( papaloizou & pringle 1983 ; papaloizou & lin 1995 ) have shown that there are two dynamical regimes for the linear propagation of warps in an accretion disk .",

    "\\(ii ) we have assumed that there is a constant supply of gas at the outer disk and the total angular momentum of the disk , @xmath174 , is much larger than that of the binary , @xmath175 .",
    "if we consider an isolated circumbinary disk ( e.g. , when an episode of mass infall from the turbulent cloud / core onto the central binary occurs ) with @xmath176 comparable or smaller than @xmath175 , then both the binary and the disk will precess around a common total angular momentum axis while the mutual inclination @xmath108 evolves . in this case ,",
    "equation ( [ eq : dtheta ] ) is replaced by = -_alignl_b-_align",
    "l_disk =- t_align ( 1+l_bl_disk ) .",
    "[ eq : dthetadt ] this equation neglects the accretion torque , so that @xmath177 . note that in general , @xmath141 and @xmath178 will be modified from the expressions given in section 3 .",
    "but as long as @xmath179 , we expect the corrections to be small ( foucart & lai , in preparation ) .",
    "it is also of interest to note that when @xmath180 , the gravitational torque tends to drive @xmath108 toward @xmath181 ( i.e. , counter - alignment ) .",
    "however , this criteria is only valid instantaneously : both @xmath174 and @xmath175 vary in time due to dissipation in the disk and accretion onto the binary , and there is thus no guarantee that the evolution of @xmath108 is monotonic . to determine which initial conditions lead to counter - alignment",
    ", assumptions have to be made regarding the evolution of @xmath174 and @xmath175 .",
    "king et al.(2005 ) showed that if @xmath175 is constant ( negligible accretion onto the binary ) , counter - alignment will occur if the less restrictive condition @xmath182 is satisfied  even though initially @xmath183 .",
    "is identical to the circumbinary case ( compare e.g. eq .  ( [ eq : dthetadt ] ) of this work with eq.(18 ) of king et al . ) . ]",
    "in this paper , we have considered scenarios for the assembly of proto - planetary disks around newly formed stellar binaries .",
    "the shape and inclination of the disk relative to the binary will determine the orbital orientations of the circumbinary planets that are formed in the disk . because of the turbulence in molecular clouds and dense cores , inside which protostellar binaries and circumbinary disks form , and also because of the tidal torques between nearby cores",
    ", it is possible , and even likely , that gas falling onto the outer region of the circumbinary disk rotates along a direction different from the rotation axis of the binary .",
    "thus in general , the newly assembled circumbinary disk will be misaligned with respect to the binary .",
    "however , the gravitational torque from the binary produces a warp and twist in the disk , and the back - reaction torque associated with that twist tends to align ( under most conditions ) the disk and the binary orbital plane .",
    "we have presented new calculations of the interaction between the warped / twisted disk and the binary , and showed that the disk warp is small under typical conditions .",
    "more importantly , we have derived new analytic expressions for the binary - disk alignment torque and the associated timescale [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : talign2 ] ) ] .",
    "our results show that the misalignment angle can be reduced appreciably after the binary accretes a few precent of its reduced mass [ see eq .",
    "[ eq : dme ] ] .",
    "proto - binaries formed by fragmentation ( either turbulent fragmentation or disk fragmentation ; see section 2 ) have initial separations much larger than 1  au .",
    "significant inward migration must occur to produce close ( sub - au ) binaries .",
    "since mass accretion necessarily takes place during disk - driven binary migration , our results then suggest that close binaries are likely to have aligned circumbinary disks , while wider binaries _ can _ have misaligned disks",
    ". this can be tested by future observations .",
    "the circumbinary planetary systems discovered by _ kepler _ ( see section 1 ) all contain close ( period @xmath184  d ) binaries .",
    "if the planets form in the late phase of the circumbinary disk ( as is likely to be the case considering the relatively small planet masses in the _ kepler _ systems ) , then the planetary orbits will be highly aligned with the binary orbits , even if the initial disk has a misaligned orientation .",
    "this is indeed what is observed .",
    "of course , given the complexity of the various processes involved , one may see some exceptions .",
    "in particular , in this paper we have not considered any dynamical processes ( few body interactions ) that may take place after the binary and planet formation .",
    "such processes can also affect the mutual inclinations of circumbinary planets .",
    "observationally , tertiary bodies on misaligned orbits around close , eclipsing binaries can be detected by searching for periodic eclipse timing variations .",
    "this has led to the identification of many binaries with tertiary companions ( e.g. , liao & qian 2010 ; gies et al .",
    "a number of post - main - sequence eclipsing binaries have been claimed to host candidate circumbinary planets , such as hw virginis ( lee et al .",
    "2009 ) , hu aquarii ( qian et al .  2011 ; gozdziewski et al .",
    "2012 ) , nn serpentis ( beuermann et al .  2010 ) , dp leonis ( beuermann et al .  2011 ) and ny vir ( qian et al .",
    ". however , some of these claims are controversial since the proposed planetary orbits may be dynamically unstable on short timescales ( see horner et al .",
    "2011,2012 ) .",
    "currently , no misaligned ( inclination @xmath185 ) circumbinary planets have been confirmed around main - sequence binaries .",
    "overall , our calculations in this paper illustrate that the mutual inclinations and other orbital characteristics of circumbinary planetary systems can serve as a diagnostic tool for the assembly and evolution of protoplanetary disks and the condition of formation of these planetary systems .",
