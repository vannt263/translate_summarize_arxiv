    "the existence of dark matter halos surrounding large , bright galaxies is well established ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) , and in the standard cold dark matter ( cdm ) paradigm , the halos of large field galaxies are expected to extend to virial radii of @xmath5  kpc to @xmath6  kpc and have masses of @xmath7 ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . until very recently",
    ", however , direct observational constraints on the nature of the dark matter halos of field galaxies have not been especially strong . in particular , it has been challenging to address the question as to whether the halos of observed galaxies are consistent with the halos that one would expect in a cdm universe .",
    "the lack of a keplerian fall  off in the rotation curves of the disks of most spiral galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) indicates that the dark matter halos extend far beyond the visible radii of the galaxies .",
    "therefore , in order to place constraints on the total mass distribution , it is necessary to use tracers of the halo potential that exist at large projected radii ( @xmath8  kpc ) .",
    "two such tracers of the large  scale potential are satellite galaxies that are in orbit about isolated host galaxies , and photons emitted by distant galaxies that , on their way to the observer , happen to pass through the potential wells of more nearby galaxies at small impact parameters ( i.e. , gravitational lensing ) .",
    "`` strong '' gravitational lensing , in which multiple and highly  distorted images of a source occur , is a rare phenomenon because it requires nearly perfect alignment of the lens and source galaxy ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "`` weak '' gravitational lensing , in which multiple images and significant image distortion do not occur , is , however , commonplace in the universe ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , and it is on this extremely mild regime of gravitational lensing that i will focus for this discussion .",
    "weak lensing of background galaxies by foreground galaxies ( `` galaxy  galaxy '' lensing ) and the motions of satellite galaxies about host galaxies are phenomena that can only lead to constraints on halo potentials through ensemble averages over statistically large samples .",
    "that is , for any given foreground galaxy , the distortion that it induces in the images of background galaxies due to weak lensing is so small that the signal can not be detected convincingly for any one foreground lens galaxy .",
    "similarly , isolated host galaxies are typically found to have 1 to 2 satellite galaxies on average and , so , the potential of any one host galaxy can not be constrained at all well by the motions of its own satellites .",
    "both galaxy  galaxy lensing and satellite dynamics , therefore , lead to statistical constraints on the halo population as a whole and by their very nature they require large samples of galaxies in order to obtain such constraints . until several years ago , galaxy  galaxy lensing and satellite dynamics were both tantalizingly close ( or frustratingly close , depending on one s point of view ) to being able to fulfill their theoretical promise to map out the gravitational potentials of the halos of field galaxies . with the advent of routine availability of wide  field imagers and the completion ( or near completion ) of large redshift surveys , however , both galaxy  galaxy lensing and satellite dynamics are now yielding sufficiently strong constraints on the dark matter halos of galaxies that the observations can be used to test the theoretical predictions ( i.e. , cdm ) at a substantive level .",
    "there are distinct advantages and disadvantages of galaxy  galaxy lensing versus satellite dynamics when it comes to constraining halo potentials . a clear advantage of galaxy ",
    "galaxy lensing is that it can be applied to _ all _ foreground galaxies and , since gravitational lensing is affected only by the total mass along the line of sight and not its dynamical state , the halos of the foreground lens galaxies need not be virialized . a complicating factor in galaxy ",
    "galaxy lensing is that it is not correct to assume that each background galaxy has been lensed solely by one foreground galaxy ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "instead , photons emitted by the distant galaxies are deflected by _ all _ mass along the line of sight , including individual galaxies , groups , and clusters ( e.g. , figure  [ multiple ] ) .",
    "that is , galaxy  galaxy lensing is inherently a multiple  deflection problem and care must be taken when using observations of galaxy  galaxy lensing to constrain the halos of a given subset of lens galaxies ( i.e. , the halos of early  type galaxies versus late  type galaxies , or the halos of high  luminosity galaxies versus low  luminosity galaxies ) .",
    "therefore , a computation of the weak lensing signal about the white lenses in figure  [ multiple ] above is _ not _ identical to a measurement of weak lensing signal _ produced by _ the white lenses since the black lenses also contribute to the net shape of the final image .",
    "that is not to say that galaxy ",
    "galaxy lensing can not be used to probe the potentials of halos surrounding lenses of differing types ; it most certainly can , but the presence of multiple deflections in the data must be taken into account when modeling the observed signal . in the case of relatively shallow data ( @xmath9 )",
    ", most sources will have been lensed by only one foreground galaxy ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but in deep data sets ( @xmath10 ) most source galaxies will have been lensed at a significant and comparable level by two or more foreground galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite )",
    ". a further disadvantage of galaxy  galaxy lensing is that the signal is very small ( systematic image distortions of @xmath11% or in the image ellipticities ) , so the images of millions of background galaxies must be obtained and , in general , be meticulously corrected for the presence of anisotropic , spatially ",
    "varying point spread functions . finally , it is possible that newtonian tidal distortions of genuine satellites of the lens galaxies could masquerade as a weak lensing signal .",
    "happily , such distortions appear to be at most a very small contributor to the observed weak lensing signal ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "an advantage to using dynamics of satellite galaxies to probe the potentials of the halos of isolated host galaxies is that , unlike deep weak lensing data , the only important potential well in the problem is that of the host galaxy . in principle , this is a `` cleaner '' , more straightforward probe of the halo potential which is intentionally restricted to the physical scales that one would expect to characterize the halos of individual large galaxies .",
    "however , there are a number of arguments against the use of satellite dynamics to probe the mass distributions of host galaxies : ( 1 ) satellites must be found at large projected radii in order to probe the halo potential on the very largest scales , ( 2 ) noise is introduced by the presence of `` interlopers '' ( i.e. , galaxies that are selected as satellites but which are , in fact , not associated dynamically with the host galaxy ) , and ( 3 ) the relaxation times of these systems are large compared to the age of the universe .",
    "the first argument is much less compelling now than it was in the past simply because of the availability of large redshift surveys ( i.e. , the data bases are now sufficiently big that although it is rare to find satellites at , say , a projected radius of 500  , the large number of redshifts that are now available makes it possible to compile statistically significant samples ) .",
    "the second argument has also become much less compelling with the realization that it is straightforward to account for the effects of interloper galaxies on the determination of the velocity dispersion ( see below ) .",
    "the third argument can still be compelling , since it makes little sense to apply a virial  type mass estimator to systems which are not relaxed . however , an assumption of virialization is not necessary _ a priori _ , and the use of secondary infall models can be used to bypass this assumption ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for the sake of a certain amount of brevity and , at the very least , an attempt at providing some level of coherent argument , i will focus here on only the most recent results that are directly relevant to the halos of field galaxies and which have been obtained from four large surveys : the combo17 survey , the red  sequence cluster survey ( rcs ) , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , and the two degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) .",
    "even with this restriction , it is simply not possible to discuss all of the most recent results from these studies in great detail , and the reader should consult the source literature for further information .",
    "finally , i should hasten to add that all errors or omissions in this article in regards to my colleagues work are entirely unintentional and entirely my own fault .",
    "i can only hope that my colleagues will be kind enough to forgive me .",

    "the combo17 survey consists of high  quality imaging data with the ability to obtain both rest frame colors and accurate photometric redshifts ( @xmath12 for @xmath13 , @xmath14 for @xmath15 , and @xmath16 for @xmath17 ) .",
    "the survey consists of 5 fields , including an extended region in the location of the chandra deep field south ( cdfs ) .",
    "the observations were carried out using the wide field imager at the 2.2m mpg / eso telescope .",
    "the field of view of the camera is @xmath18 and the 17band filter set covers a wavelength range of @xmath19 .",
    "the latter allows for a rough determination of the spectral energy distributions of the objects , which in turn leads to both reliable classification of the objects into galaxies , quasars , and stars , as well as the ability to determine accurate photometric redshifts .",

    "the data set is particularly well  suited to this task because of the reliability with which background galaxies ( i.e. , lensed sources ) can be separated from foreground galaxies ( i.e. , the lenses ) .",
    "note , too , that although the full combo17 survey covers 5 fields , the results shown here come from only 3 of the fields ( a field centered on the cluster a901 , the cdfs field , and a random field @xcite ) .",

    "although the foreground  background distinction between a given pair of galaxies in the rcs data is by no means as secure as in the combo17 data , the rcs is nevertheless a superb data set for galaxy  galaxy studies simply because of the area covered ( @xmath27 times larger than combo17 for the weak lensing work ) . given that weak lensing is primarily a statistical game , this is a good example of how well the galaxy  galaxy lensing signal can be detected and also used to constrain the nature of dark matter halos given only minimal distance information and a tremendous number of candidate lenses and sources .",

    "general relativity tells us that any mass will cause a curvature of spacetime in its vicinity . therefore , any mass located along the line of sight to a distant luminous object will act as a gravitational lens by deflecting light rays emanating from the object as they propagate through the universe .",
    "the most striking instances of gravitational lensing ( e.g. , multiple images , rings , arcs ) are examples of rare phenomena caused by strong gravitational lenses , which greatly distort the images of distant galaxies . in contrast to this , weak gravitational lenses distort the images of distant galaxies very little but produce a net coherent pattern of image distortions in which there is a slight preference for the lensed galaxies to be oriented tangentially with respect to the direction vector that connects their centroids with the center of the gravitational potential of the lens .",
    "while weak lenses do not give rise to stunning individual images , they are detectable in a statistical sense via ensemble averages over many mildly  distorted images ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    provided the distance traveled by the light ray is very much greater than the scale size of the lens , it is valid to adopt the `` thin lens approximation '' in order to describe a gravitational lens . consider a lens with an arbitrary 3-dimensional potential , @xmath43 . in the thin lens approximation a conveniently scaled 2-dimensional potential for the lens ( i.e. , the 3-dimensional potential of the lens integrated along the optic axis ) is given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the location of the lensed image on the sky , measured with respect to the optic axis , and @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 are angular diameter distances between the lens and source , observer and lens , and observer and source , respectively ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is then straightforward to relate the gravitational potential of the lens to the two fundamental quantities that characterize the lens : the convergence ( @xmath49 ) and the shear ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "the convergence , which describes the isotropic focusing of light rays , is given by @xmath51 the shear describes tidal gravitational forces acting across a bundle of light rays and , therefore , the shear has both a magnitude , @xmath52 , and an orientation , @xmath53 . in terms of @xmath54 ,",
    "the components of the shear are given by @xmath55\\ ] ] and @xmath56.\\ ] ]    the effect of convergence and shear acting together in a gravitational lens is to distort the images of distant objects . consider a source galaxy which is spherical in shape . in the absence of a gravitational lens , an observer would see an image of the galaxy which is truly circular .",
    "if a gravitational lens is interposed along the line of sight to the distant galaxy , the observer will see an image which , to first order , is elliptical and the major axis of the ellipse will be oriented tangentially with respect to the direction vector on the sky that connects the centroids of the image and the lens .",
    "that is , the circular source is distorted into an ellipse , and to first order the distortion consists of both a tangential stretch of @xmath57 and a radial compression of @xmath58 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the weak lensing regime , both the convergence and shear are small ( @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) .",
    "the fundamental premise in all attempts to detect weak lensing is that , in the absence of lensing , galaxy images have an intrinsically random ellipticity distribution .",
    "gravitational lensing then introduces a shift in the ellipticity distribution that , in the mean , manifests as a tangential alignment of background sources around foreground lenses .",
    "the image of a distant galaxy can be approximated an ellipse with complex image ellipticity given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the major and minor axes , respectively , and @xmath64 is the position angle .",
    "the complex image ellipticity is often referred to as the `` image polarization '' ( e.g. , @xcite ) and is computed in terms of flux  weighted second moments , @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the intensity at a given pixel and @xmath67 is a weighting function .",
    "the real and imaginary components of the image polarization are then given by : @xmath68    the _ observed _ image polarization for any one source is , of course , a combination of its intrinsic ellipticity and any ellipticity that is induced by lensing . in the limit of weak lensing , the observed image polarization , @xmath69 , is related to the intrinsic image polarization , @xmath70 through a shift in the complex plane . although we can not determine @xmath70 for any one particular source galaxy , we have that the mean intrinsic ellipticity distribution for an ensemble of source galaxies is @xmath71 since the galaxies should be randomly  oriented in the absence of lensing .",
    "an estimator for the shear induced by weak lensing is then @xmath72 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this simple estimator does not reflect the fact that the way in which the shear alters the shape of a source depends upon its intrinsic ellipticity , and in practice this is generally taken into account when computing the shear .",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for discussions of the `` shear polarizability '' and `` shear responsivity '' of sources .",
    "in addition , it is worth noting that , while it is common practice to approximate image shapes as ellipses , there will be some images that have been sufficiently distorted by galaxy ",
    "galaxy lensing that a mild bending , or `` flexion '' , of the images will occur and such images can not be accurately represented as ellipses . in principle , flexion of images can be used to detect weak lensing with a signal  to  noise that is increased over the common practice of fitting equivalent image ellipses @xcite , @xcite . a preliminary application of this technique",
    "@xcite has been carried out with the deep lens survey @xcite , and it will be interesting to see how the technique is further developed and implemented in practice .    the first attempts to detect systematic weak lensing of background galaxies by foreground galaxies ( @xcite , @xcite ) were met with a certain degree of skepticism because the apparent distortion of the source galaxy images was rather smaller than one would expect based upon the typical rotation velocities of the disks of large spiral galaxies .",
    "the situation changed when brainerd , blandford & smail @xcite measured the orientations of 506 faint galaxies ( @xmath73 ) with respect to the locations of 439 bright galaxies ( @xmath74 ) and found that the orientation of the faint galaxies was inconsistent with a random distribution at the 99.9% confidence level .",
    "the faint galaxies showed a clear preference for tangential alignment with the direction vector on the sky that connected the centroids of the faint and bright galaxies , in agreement with the expectations of systematic weak lensing of the faint galaxies by the bright galaxies .    almost immediately , a number of similar investigations followed in the wake of brainerd , blandford & smail @xcite ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these studies made use of a wide variety of data and analysis techniques , and all were broadly consistent with one another and with the results of brainerd , blandford & smail @xcite ( see , e.g. , the review by brainerd & blandford @xcite ) . the first truly undeniable detection of galaxy  galaxy lensing was obtained by fischer et al .",
    "@xcite with 225 sq .",
    "deg .  of early commissioning data from the sdss , and it was this result in particular that helped to make the study of galaxy  galaxy lensing into a respectable endeavor , whereas previously many had considered the whole field rather dodgy at best .",
    "fisher et al .",
    "@xcite demonstrated conclusively that even in the limit of somewhat poor imaging quality , including the presence of an anisotropic point spread function due to drift scanning , galaxy  galaxy lensing can be detected with very high significance in wide  field imaging surveys . in the last few years , detections of galaxy  galaxy lensing and the use of the signal to constrain the dark matter halos of field galaxies has improved dramatically ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) owing to a number of factors that include such things as very large survey areas , sophisticated methods for correcting image shapes due to anisotropic and spatially  varying point spread functions , and the use of distance information for large numbers foreground lens galaxies in the form of either spectroscopic or photometric redshifts .",
    "figure  [ henk : gammat ] shows one example of the high statistical significance with which weak lensing due to galaxies is now being routinely detected .",
    "the result comes from an analysis of the distortion of the images of @xmath75 source galaxies due to @xmath76 lens galaxies in the rcs @xcite , where the lens and source populations were separated solely on the basis of their apparent magnitudes .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ henk : gammat ] shows the mean tangential shear _ computed _ about the lens centers which , because of the clustering of the lens galaxies , is not simply interpreted as the tangential shear _ due to _ individual lens centers .",
    "instead , it is a projected ( i.e. , 2dimensional ) galaxy  mass cross  correlation function , and in order to compute the average properties of the halos of the lens galaxies it is necessary to , e.g. , make use of monte carlo simulations that include all of the multiple weak deflections that the sources have undergone .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ henk : gammat ] shows a control statistic in which the tangential shear about the lens centers is computed after rotating the images of the sources by @xmath77 .",
    "if the signal in the top panel of figure  [ henk : gammat ] is caused by gravitational lensing , the control statistic in the bottom panel of figure  [ henk : gammat ] should be consistent with zero ( and indeed it is ) .",
    "note that , although the tangential shear about the rcs lenses persists to scales of order @xmath78 , the shear on such large scales is not indicative of the masses of individual lens galaxies ; rather it reflects the intrinsic clustering of the lenses .",
    "it is also worth noting that less than decade ago observers were struggling to measure a tangential shear of @xmath79 with a modest degree of confidence .",
    "now , however , confident detection of tangential shears of @xmath80 is effectively `` routine '' in these extremely large data sets .",
    "the mean tangential shear , @xmath81 , in an annulus of projected radius @xmath82 is related to the projected surface mass density of the lens through @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the mean surface mass density interior to the projected radius @xmath82 , @xmath85 is the projected surface mass density at radius @xmath82 ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , and @xmath86 is the so  called critical surface mass density : @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the velocity of light and @xmath48 , @xmath47 , and @xmath46 are again angular diameter distances @xcite .",
    "the quantity @xmath89 above is , therefore , a mean excess projected mass density . shown in figure  [ erin : fig6 ]",
    "is the mean excess projected surface mass density in physical units of @xmath90 for @xmath91 lens galaxies in the sdss for which spectroscopic redshifts are known @xcite .",
    "in addition to spectroscopic redshifts for the lenses , photometric redshifts were used for @xmath92 source galaxies . moreover , because the redshifts of the lens galaxies are known , @xmath93 can be computed as a function of the physical projected radius at the redshift of the lens ( rather than an angular scale ) . in figure",
    "[ erin : fig6 ] , @xmath93 has been corrected for the clustering of the sources around the lenses via a function which is effectively a weighted cross ",
    "correlation function between the lenses and sources @xcite .",
    "having obtained a measurement of @xmath94 , or equivalently @xmath89 , constraints can then be placed on the nature of the dark matter halos of the lens galaxies by modeling the observed signal . as mentioned earlier",
    ", quite a bit of care has to be taken in doing this if the goal is to constrain the halo parameters as a function of , say , the host luminosity , color , or morphology ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in the past few years , however , good constraints on the mass of an `` average '' halo associated with an @xmath95 galaxy , as well as fundamental differences between the halos of @xmath95 ellipticals versus @xmath95 spirals , have emerged from galaxy  galaxy lensing studies and it is those studies which are summarized below .",
    "in order to use satellite galaxies to probe the potentials of host galaxies , one needs to _ define _ an appropriate sample of host and satellite galaxies . unlike cosmology simulators who are blessed with full 6-dimensional phase space information ,",
    "observers are , of course , limited to 3 dimensions ( ra , dec , and redshift ) . given this limited information , then , one must base the selection criteria on projected radii ( evaluated at the redshift of the host ) and relative radial velocities , @xmath96 , of the candidate hosts and satellites . to guarantee that the dynamics of the satellites are determined solely by their host galaxy , the hosts must be determined to be `` isolated '' in some sense .",
    "that is , if another large , bright galaxy is too close to a candidate host galaxy to guarantee that the satellite orbits are affected solely by the candidate host , that candidate host and its satellites are rejected from the sample .",
    "satellites must , necessarily , be fainter than their host , be found within some reasonable projected radius of the host , and have some reasonable line of sight velocity with respect to the host .",
    "there are a number of different selection criteria that have been used in the recent literature , and three sets of selection criteria that have been used in more than one investigation are summarized below :    1 .",
    "hosts must be at least 8 times brighter than any other galaxy that is within @xmath97  kpc and @xmath98  km  sec@xmath99 .",
    "in addition , hosts must be at least 2 times brighter than any other galaxy that is within @xmath100  mpc and @xmath98  km  sec@xmath99 .",
    "satellites must be at least 8 times fainter than their host , must be found within @xmath97  kpc , and must have @xmath101  km  sec@xmath99 . here @xmath102 has been adopted ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "2 .   hosts must be at least 2 times brighter than any other galaxy that falls within @xmath103  mpc and @xmath104  km  s@xmath99 .",
    "satellites must be at least 4 times fainter than their host , must be found within @xmath105  kpc and must have @xmath98  km  s@xmath99 .",
    "here @xmath106 has been adopted ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "3 .   hosts must be at least 2.5 times brighter than any other galaxy that is within a projected radius of @xmath107  kpc and a relative radial velocity difference of @xmath98  km  sec@xmath99 .",
    "satellites must be at least 6.25 times fainter than their host , must be found within @xmath97  kpc , and the host  satellite velocity difference must be @xmath101  km  sec@xmath99 . here",
    "@xmath106 has been adopted ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "although the above criteria may seem lax or even somewhat arbitrary , in the case of the first two sets of criteria , both the milky way and m31 would be excluded from the sample of hosts .",
    "that is , these particular selection criteria give rise to samples of unusually isolated host galaxies .",
    "in addition , both prada et al .",
    "@xcite and brainerd @xcite adopted a number of different selection criteria in their investigations of the satellites of sdss galaxies and concluded that there were no statistical differences between results that were obtained with different selection criteria .",
    "in other words , provided sufficiently `` reasonable '' criteria are adopted for selecting isolated hosts and their satellites , the results of the investigations are stable to modest differences in the details of those selection criteria .",
    "no matter what selection criteria are adopted , however , there will always be `` interlopers '' in the satellite data .",
    "interlopers are galaxies that are falsely identified as satellites ; that is , they pass the formal selection criteria , but they are not , in fact , dynamically associated with the host galaxy .",
    "the presence of interlopers will artificially inflate any measurement of the velocity dispersion of genuine satellites , and recent investigations of satellite dynamics ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) have corrected for the effects of interlopers by modeling the distribution of host  satellite velocity differences as the sum of a gaussian distribution ( due to the genuine satellites ) and a constant offset ( due to the interlopers ) .",
    "prada et al.@xcite used numerical simulations to show that this is a sensible way in which to correct for the effects of interlopers . moreover , both brainerd & specian @xcite and prada et al .",
    "@xcite have pointed out that an accurate determination of the velocity dispersion profile , @xmath108 , for satellite galaxies depends on a proper determination of the interloper fraction as an explicit function of the projected radius .",
    "that is , by purely geometrical effects , the interloper fraction is necessarily an increasing function of @xmath82 .",
    "an example of fitting a `` gaussian plus offset '' to the distribution of velocity differences for late  type galaxies and early  type galaxies in the 2dfgrs is shown in figure  [ dv : fit ] .",
    "one can clearly see from this figure that the velocity dispersion of the satellites is a function of the morphology of the host galaxy ( being larger for early  type hosts than late  type hosts ) , and that the interloper fraction increases with projected radius .",
    "the above `` gaussian plus offset '' fit to the distribution of host  satellite velocity differences accounts for the fact that the number of interlopers is a function of projected radius , and it assumes _ a priori _ that the number of interlopers at a given projected radius is constant with @xmath109 .",
    "recently , however , van den bosch et al .  @xcite used simulations of galaxy redshift surveys to investigate this and found a sharp increase in the number of interlopers for small relative velocities .",
    "van den bosch et al .",
    "@xcite note , however , that the value of @xmath110 that is determined from a simple `` gaussian plus offset '' fit is not strongly affected by the fact that the number of interlopers varies with @xmath109 .",
    "this is because the best ",
    "fitting value of @xmath110 is rather insensitive to the precise value of the interloper fraction .",
    "brainerd @xcite also finds that the number of interlopers is larger for small values of @xmath109 than it is for large values of @xmath109 , but that the effect is not nearly as pronounced as found by van den bosch et al .",
    "given the size of the error bars on the distribution of host  satellite velocity differences in the current observational samples , then , it would appear that the simple `` gaussian plus offset '' fit to the distribution of velocity differences is more than adequate to the task of estimating @xmath108 .",

    "the errors on @xmath108 are large , and formally @xmath108 for the deep2 galaxies is fitted well by a constant value : @xmath169  , @xmath170  , @xmath171  . therefore , isothermal halos for the deep2 galaxies can not be ruled out at the moment .",

    "although it ought to be straightforward and even easy to compare the halo masses and galaxy mass  to  light ratios that are obtained from different studies , in practice it is rather like comparing persimmons to tomatoes ; i.e. , they are vaguely similar on the inside and outside , but they are definitely not interchangeable .",
    "the fundamental problem is that it is simply not possible to measure the `` total '' mass of a galaxy halo ( since it is not possible to say where such a halo `` ends '' ) and , hence , all halo masses are simply masses that are contained within some physical radius of the center of the halo . along those same lines , and given that velocity dispersion profiles of nfw halos decrease with radius , if one wants to compare the results of two investigations which have measured a velocity dispersion averaged over some large scale , it is important that those scales be _",
    "identical_. that is , suppose a single measurement of @xmath174 is made by averaging over scales @xmath175  kpc in one study and a single measurement of @xmath174 is made by averaging over scales @xmath176  kpc in another .",
    "if the second measurement of @xmath174 is lower than the first by some significant amount , that does not necessarily mean that the values are in disagreement . they would be in disagreement if both halos were isothermal spheres , but if the halos are nfw objects , then it is only to be expected that the second measurement would be lower than the first .",
    "a more subtle problem is the definition of the `` virial radius '' in the context of nfw halos . while @xmath111 was originally proposed as the radius at which the interior mass density is 200 times the critical mass density ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , it is not at all uncommon to find that investigators who have fit nfw models to their data have defined the virial radius as the radius at which the interior mass density is 200 times the mean mass density of the universe",
    "therefore , what is meant by a `` virial mass '' in the context of an nfw fit to data can ( and does ) vary from investigation to investigation , and a certain amount of care has to be taken when comparing such results . despite the difficulties of comparing the conclusions of different studies , i will forge ahead because it is becoming clear that a consistent picture really is emerging on the topic of the masses of the halos of field galaxies , and their corresponding mass  to  light ratios .",
    "the weak lensing studies yield results that are by and large consistent with each other , and the dynamical studies seem to be in general agreement with the trends in the weak lensing data : the halos have masses that are consistent with expectations for galaxy  sized halos in cdm , and there are real , physical differences between halos surrounding ( i ) early  type and late  type galaxies and ( ii ) high  luminosity and low  luminosity galaxies .      in the case of galaxy  galaxy lensing , it is not possible at the moment to discriminate between shear profiles that are caused by nfw versus isothermal galaxy halos .",
    "therefore , investigators will often choose one or the other to constrain the properties of the halos that are producing the lensing signal .",
    "in the case of isothermal sphere halos , the velocity dispersions of the lens galaxies used to model the observed signal are often chosen to scale as in eqn .",

    "@xcite , however , no correction for an increasing number of interlopers with projected radius was made and this may have led to an incorrect conclusion that @xmath218 was independent of @xmath82 . in the case of brainerd & specian @xcite , the increasing number of interlopers at large @xmath82 was taken into account , but only galaxies from the 100k data release of the 2dfgrs were used ( i.e. , roughly half as many galaxies as in the full data release ) , and although @xmath219 was consistent with a constant value in their data , the later analysis by brainerd @xcite showed that this was simply due to the rather large error bars in brainerd & specian @xcite .",
    "this being the case , the mass  to  light ratios published by these two studies are suspect at some level , but it is unclear at the moment just how suspect they may actually be .",

    "in addition , when the weak lenses and host galaxies are each modeled as nfw objects , a fairly consistent value of the average virial mass of the halos of @xmath95 galaxies is found : @xmath241 .",
    "further , it seems to be clear that both weak lensing and satellite dynamics indicate that the masses of the halos of early  type galaxies are larger than that of late  type galaxies , and that at fixed luminosity the mass  to  light ratios of early  type galaxies are larger than those of late  type galaxies .",
    "although the simple isothermal sphere can reproduce the flatness of the rotation curves of the disks of spiral galaxies at large radii , there are both observational and theoretical arguments in favor of halos which are flattened , rather than spherical .",
    "direct observational evidence for halo flattening that has come from studies of individual galaxies is somewhat scarce , however , owing to the fact that there are relatively few galaxies for which the shape of the halo potential can be probed directly . nevertheless , the evidence for flattened halos of individual galaxies is diverse and includes such observations as the dynamics of polar ring galaxies , the geometry of x - ray isophotes , the flaring of hi gas in spirals , the evolution of gaseous warps , and the kinematics of population ii stars in our own galaxy .",
    "in particular , studies of disk systems which probe distances of order 15  kpc from the galactic planes suggest that the ratio of shortest to longest principle axes of the halos is @xmath242 ( see , e.g. , the comprehensive review by sackett @xcite and references therein ) .",

    "@xcite found that , provided the disk mass is small compared to the halo mass , the halo of the spiral galaxy which lenses the quasar b1600 + 434 is consistent with @xmath243 .",
    "in addition , the 17 strong lens systems studied by keeton , kochanek & falco @xcite showed some preference for flattened mass distributions , although extremely flattened ( i.e. , `` disky '' ) mass distributions were ruled out .",
    "finally , a recent analysis of the luminous halos of 1047 edge  on disk galaxies in the sdss suggests that the old stellar populations of these galaxies consist of moderately flattened spheroids with axis ratios of @xmath244 @xcite .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "high  resolution simulations of dissipationless cdm models consistently produce markedly non  spherical galaxy halos with a mean projected ellipticity of @xmath245 ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "it is known , however , that the dark matter will react to the condensation of baryons during galaxy formation ( e.g. , @xcite ) and that the resulting increase in the central density leads to a more spherical shape than if dissipation were not considered ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recent simulations performed by kazantzidis et al .",

    "however , on scales @xmath248 kazantzidis et al .",
    "@xcite find that the projected ellipticity is @xmath245 .",
    "since both the weak lensing shear and satellite dynamics are determined primarily by the large  scale mass distribution of the halos , the roundness of the mass distribution on small scales due to gas cooling should not have a dramatic effect . from a theoretical standpoint , therefore , it is not at all unreasonable to expect that galaxy ",
    "galaxy lensing and satellite dynamics should reflect a significant flattening of the halos .      unlike a spherically  symmetric lens for which the gravitational lensing shear is isotropic about the lens center , the shear due to an elliptical lens is anisotropic about the lens center .",

    "further , they assumed that the major axis of the lens image was aligned with the major axis of the halo in projection on the sky .",
    "this is a sensible assumption provided the majority of the lenses are relaxed systems , and it is justified at least partially by the observations of kochanek @xcite who found that the major axes of the mass and light of strong lens galaxies were aligned to within @xmath259 in projection on the sky .",
    "hoekstra , yee & gladders @xcite performed a maximum likelihood analysis and concluded that spherical halos ( i.e. , @xmath260 ) could be ruled out at the 99.5% confidence level on the basis of their weak lensing signal ( see figure  [ henk : flat ] ) .",
    "formally , hoekstra , yee & gladders @xcite found @xmath261 .",
    "since the mean ellipticity of the lens images in their study was @xmath262 , this implies a mean halo ellipticity of @xmath263 and a projected axis ratio of @xmath264 .",
    "this is in excellent agreement with the expectations for cdm halos , as well as previous observational constraints on halo flattening obtained on large physical scales ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "while it may yet be a bit premature to call this result a `` definitive '' measurement of the flattening of field galaxy halos , it is certainly impressive and the statistics will only improve as weak lensing surveys become larger .      in the case of substantially flattened halos of host galaxies",
    ", one would naively expect that satellite galaxies would show a somewhat anisotropic distribution about the host .",
    "that is , barring possible effects due to infall rates and orbital decay , one would expect the satellites to have some preference for being located near to the major axis of the host s halo . until very recently ,",
    "however , such an observation had not been confidently made and , moreover , a preference for clustering of satellite galaxies along the _ minor _ axes of host galaxies has been reported at a statistically significant level by a handful of authors ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the apparent alignment of satellite galaxies with the minor axes of the host galaxies is often referred to as the holmberg effect and in the naive picture of satellite orbits in flattened potentials , observations of the holmberg effect lead to the uncomfortable conclusion that not only is the halo mass flattened , but it is also anti  aligned with the luminous regions of the galaxy .    while one is tempted to dismiss the minor axis clustering of satellites observed by zaritsky et al .",

    "she selected her samples using three different criteria : ( 1 ) the criteria used by sales & lambas @xcite in their investigation of the holmberg effect for 2dfgrs galaxies , ( 2 ) the criteria used by mckay et al .",

    "further , the mean angle between the major axis of the host and the direction vector on the sky that connected the centroids of the hosts and satellites was found to be @xmath270 for sample 1 , @xmath271 for sample 2 , and @xmath272 for sample 3 .",
    "that is , a clear anisotropy in the distribution of satellites about the hosts was seen , and the satellites showed a preference for being aligned with the _ major _ axis of the host rather than the minor axis ( see figure  [ holmberg1 ] ) .",
    "in addition , brainerd @xcite investigated the dependence of @xmath273 with projected radius on the sky and found that the majority of the anisotropy arose on small scales ( @xmath274  kpc ) in all three samples ( see figure  [ holmberg2 ] ) .",
    "in other words , the anisotropy was detected on physical scales that are comparable to the expected virial radii of large , bright galaxies . on scales",
    "much larger than the expected virial radii of galaxy ",
    "sized halos ( @xmath275  kpc to 500  kpc ) , the distribution of satellites about the sdss hosts was consistent with an isotropic distribution at the 1@xmath20 level .    aside from the brainerd @xcite claim of `` planar '' ( rather than `` polar '' ) alignment of satellites with the symmetry axes of their hosts ,",
    "there has been only one other similar claim .",
    "valtonen , teerikorpi & argue @xcite found a tendency for compact satellites to be aligned with the major axes of highly  inclined disk galaxies ; however , their sample consisted of only 7 host galaxies .",
    "although it is extremely tempting to accept its veracity based upon an intuitive sense that planar alignment of satellites is more dynamically sensible than polar alignment , it is clear that the brainerd @xcite result is badly in need of independent confirmation .",
    "sales & lambas @xcite used a data set of very similar size ( and in one case identical selection criteria ) to that of brainerd @xcite yet did not detect any anisotropy in the satellite distribution when they analysed their entire sample .",
    "why this is the case remains a mystery at the moment , but it may be attributable to a combination of two things .",
    "first , the velocity errors in the 2dfgrs are typically larger than those in the sdss ( @xmath276  versus @xmath37  to @xmath38  ) . at some level",
    ", this would lead to a higher fraction of interlopers ( i.e. , false satellites ) in the sales & lambas @xcite sample than in the brainerd @xcite samples .",
    "second , van den bosch et al .",
    "@xcite found that when they combined mock redshift surveys with the 2dfgrs , there was a clear absence of satellites at small projected radii in the 2dfgrs .",
    "since the majority of the anisotropy seen by brainerd @xcite appears to come primarily from small scales , it could be that sales & lambas @xcite simply had too few pairs of hosts and satellites at small separations to detect the anisotropy .",
    "any lack of host  satellite pairs in the 2dfgrs data , however , does not explain why a holmberg effect was detected by sales & lambas @xcite when they restricted their analysis to host ",
    "satellite pairs with @xmath266  .",
    "when brainerd @xcite imposed the same restriction on her sample 1 ( i.e. , the sample selected using the sales & lambas @xcite selection criteria ) , she found that the satellites with @xmath266   displayed an anisotropy that was identical to that of the full sample : a clear alignment of the satellites with the host major axes .",
    "the cause of this discrepancy is not at all obvious",
    ". it may in part be attributable to the fact that a value of @xmath277  is comparable to the error in a typical measurement of @xmath109 for hosts and satellites in the 2dfgrs . also , work by van den bosch et al .",
    "@xcite suggests that the interloper fraction is substantially higher for host  satellite pairs with low values of @xmath109 than it is for host  satellite pairs with high values of @xmath109 .",
    "it could , therefore , be possible that the sales & lambas @xcite sample with @xmath266  is heavily contaminated with interlopers and some strange , unknown selection bias is giving rise to their signal .",
    "finally , it is worth notating that not only are the observational conclusions about the distribution of satellite galaxies particularly muddy at the moment , so too are the theoretical conclusions .",
    "zaritsky et al .",
    "@xcite compared their observed holmberg effect with high  resolution cdm simulations and were unable to recover their observations .",
    "pearrubia et al .",
    "@xcite investigated both polar and planar orbits of satellites inside a massive , flattened dark matter halo and found that the planar orbits decayed more quickly that the polar orbits .",
    "they therefore suggest that such differences in orbital decay rates could be the origin of the holmberg effect .",
    "abadi et al .",
    "@xcite suggest that the holmberg effect could be caused by the cumulative effects of accretion of satellites by the primary .",
    "however , knebe et al .",
    "@xcite found that the orbits of satellites of primary galaxies in cluster environments were located preferentially within a cone of opening angle 40@xmath278 ( i.e. , planar alignment , not polar ) .",
    "since the structure of cold dark matter halos is essentially independent of the mass scale of the halo ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) , the implication of this result would be a preference for the satellites of isolated galaxies to be aligned with the major axis of the host .",
    "all of this in mind , perhaps the only answer to the question `` are either the sales & lambas @xcite or brainerd @xcite observations of anisotropic satellite distributions consistent with galaxy halos in a cdm universe ? ''",
    "is , for now , `` maybe '' .",
    "there has been a long period of time over which it has been perfectly acceptable to write papers on investigations into the nature of the dark matter halos of field galaxies that begin with a statement along the lines of `` although modern theories of galaxy formation posit that all large galaxies reside within massive halos of dark matter , the characteristic properties of those halos ( e.g. , mass , radial extent , and shape ) are not well  constrained by the current observations '' .",
    "that time is now coming to an end .",
    "the wealth of data that has been acquired in recent years is truly beginning to place strong , direct constraints on the dark matter halos of field galaxies .",
    "weak lensing and satellite dynamics have proven themselves to be excellent probes of the gravitational potentials of large , bright galaxies on physical scales @xmath279  kpc . while one might be skeptical and discount the results that come from one technique or the other , the fact that both are yielding consistent constraints can not be ignored . both weak lensing and satellite dynamics",
    "lead to statistical constraints on the halo population as a whole , rather than constraints on any one particular galaxy halo , and it is especially the acquisition of extremely large data sets that has allowed these techniques to begin to fulfill their promise of mapping out the gravitational potentials associated with large , massive halos .",
    "weak lensing and satellite dynamics have inherent advantages and disadvantages , but since their systematic errors and selection biases are completely uncorrelated , they are extremely complementary to each other .",
    "at least at the moment , when strong constraints are only just beginning to emerge from each technique , this complementarity is very reassuring .    based upon my own critical , and hopefully unbiased , reading of the recent literature ,",
    "i think it is fair to say that , both individually and in combination , weak lensing and satellite dynamics are pointing toward the following scenario for the nature of large , bright field galaxies and their halos :    * the dark matter halos are well - characterized by nfw ",
    "type objects in terms of their gravitational properties .",
    "the dynamics of satellite galaxies strongly prefer nfw halos to isothermal halos . *",
    "the virial masses that are inferred for large field galaxies are in good agreement with the predictions for galaxy  mass halos in the context of cold dark matter .",
    "specifically , the virial mass of the halo of an `` average '' @xmath139 galaxy is in the range @xmath280 when nfw profiles are fit to the data .",
    "* there are clear differences in the depths of the potential wells of the halos that surround galaxies of differing morphology and differing intrinsic luminosity .",
    "specifically , the virial masses of the halos of @xmath139 ellipticals exceed those of @xmath139 spirals by a factor of at least 2 .",
    "the actual value of the mass excess depends upon details of the data and its analysis .",
    "in addition , the virial masses of the halos of high luminosity galaxies exceed those of low luminosity galaxies .",
    "again , however , the amount by which they differ depends upon details of the data and its analysis . *",
    "averaged over all galaxies with @xmath0 , the mass  to  light ratio computed on scales larger than the optical radii of the galaxies is , at most , weakly ",
    "dependent upon the luminosity of the galaxy . at the 2@xmath20 level ,",
    "the mass  to  light ratio of the average galaxy with @xmath0 is consistent with a constant value . * the dark matter halos",
    "are flattened , rather than spherical , and the degree of flattening on large scales ( @xmath281  kpc to @xmath282  kpc ) is consistent with the predictions of cold dark matter .",
    "it is worth noting that the above list comes from quite a diverse set of data . in particular ,",
    "the data are spread over a wide range in redshift . with the exception of preliminary data from deep2 ,",
    "the satellite dynamics studies have median redshifts of @xmath283 .",
    "the weak lenses in the sdss data have a median redshift of @xmath284 and the weak lenses in the rcs and combo17 data have considerably higher redshifts , @xmath285 .",
    "since it is clear that the field galaxy population has evolved since @xmath286 , it is not entirely fair to lump the results from all of these studies together , and i think the big challenge to the weak lensing community in particular will be to eventually place constraints on the evolution of field galaxies and their halos from , say , @xmath287 to the present .",
    "nevertheless , i think we have reached a particularly gratifying time in which we are really being able to measure some of the fundamental properties of dark mater halos on physical scales that extend well beyond the visible images of the galaxies at their centers .",
    "a remarkably consistent picture of the large  scale gravitational properties of the halos is emerging from the observations and , at least for now , that picture seems entirely in accord with a cold dark matter universe .",

    "<S> galaxy lensing and ( ii ) the dynamics of satellite galaxies in orbit about large host galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> both of these techniques are statistical in their nature ( i.e. , large samples of galaxies are required to obtain a `` signal '' ) , but since they have inherently different selection biases and systematic errors , they are quite complementary to each other . results of work over the last several years on weak lensing and satellite dynamics is revealing a remarkably consistent picture regarding the dark matter halos of bright field galaxies ( @xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the halos extend to large physical radii ( @xmath1  kpc ) and are flattened in projection on the sky , there is a marked difference in the depths of the potential wells of early  type galaxies and late  type galaxies , and the velocity dispersion profiles of the halos , @xmath2 , decrease at large projected radii . </S>",
    "<S> all of these are expected to hold true in a cold dark matter universe and , while neither technique can address the possible small  scale ( @xmath3  kpc ) conflicts between cold dark matter and observed galaxies , on scales @xmath4  kpc both techniques yield results that are consistent with each other , and with the predictions of cold dark matter .     </S>",
