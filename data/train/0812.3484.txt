    "a wide class of problems concerned with the quantum information processing requires an efficient and robust methods of the creation of highly - entangled states from individual qubit states @xcite , @xcite .",
    "therefore , the search and the development of reliable schemes for entanglement production appears to be a rather important quantum computational issue .",
    "recently , several proposals for the entanglement generation in the semiconductor nanostructures based on the quantum dots ( qds ) ( see , e. g. , refs .",
    "@xcite - @xcite ) and its application ( see , e. g. , refs .",
    "@xcite - @xcite ) have been made . in those works , the fault - tolerant quantum algorithms @xcite - @xcite , the mechanisms of the quantum teleportation @xcite - @xcite , and the cluster state preparation in the measurement - based quantum computations @xcite exploit specific entangled charge or spin states of electrons bound in the qds .",
    "in particular , the logical states of an individual ( physical ) qubit can be presented by two single - electron orbital states localized in the spatially separated potential minima of a double quantum dot ( dqd ) @xcite - @xcite .",
    "the quantum operations on that so - called charge qubit can be accomplished via adiabatic variation of the dqd confinement potential @xcite - @xcite or by the electromagnetically induced resonant transitions between the dqd states @xcite - @xcite . in order to perform some non - trivial two - qubit operation on an arbitrary pair of qubits in a quantum register",
    "one should organize the interaction between those qubits for a finite period of time .",
    "in general , after interaction is off , the qubits become entangled with each other , i. e. , their total wave function can not be presented as the product of an individual qubit wave functions .",
    "the charge qubit entanglement via electrostatic control over the tunnel coupling between two neighboring qubits has been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite - @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we suggest another technique of entanglement production in the two - dimensional array of the charge qubits .",
    "the coupling between the qubits is now indirect and mediated by an auxiliary structure ( as ) fabricated from the quasilinear chains of the qds and containing a single ( probe ) electron in the quantized part of its conduction band .",
    "the single - electron energy spectrum of that structure is affected by qubit states through the electrostatic interaction between the probe and qubit electrons . in order to demonstrate how to entangle the qubits we analyze in detail the probe electron dynamics in a separate quasilinear qd as capacitively coupled to the charge qubit .",
    "as we shall see , appropriate variation of the confinement potential of such an as through the application of compensating voltages aligns the energy levels of individual as qds for _ one of two _ logical qubit states .",
    "it amounts to sharp increase of the tunnel coupling between the as qds that , in its turn , allows for efficient probe electron transfer ( pet ) along the as through one of the hybridized as states ( the transport state ) .",
    "the transfer protocol is accomplished via the resonant transitions connecting two states each localized in corresponding edge as qd and the transport state delocalized over the as .",
    "the numerical simulation of electron dynamics under tight - binding approximation confirms the possibility of successful pet implementation .",
    "two points are important here .",
    "firstly , pet from one edge as qd to another and back results in the implementation of the phase operation on attached qubit . secondly , the pet between the edge as qds takes place only if the qubit is in the predetermined logical state .",
    "therefore , the following dynamics of probe electron appears , in its turn , to be predetermined ( conditioned ) by the qubit state .",
    "it enables us to organize conditional quantum operations ( in particular , controlled - phase operation ) that is the key part of entangled state preparation . using these results and assuming that pet in a complex planar",
    "as can be divided into the sequence of elementary pets along its quasilinear components , it becomes possible to construct any desired entangled state of the charge qubits attached to that as .",
    "particularly , the set of described manipulations underlying controlled - phase operations , combined with single qubit hadamard rotations , is sufficient for the nine - qubit shor encoding procedure @xcite .",
    "moreover , the conditional pet may be exploited for an error syndrome measurements and for usual qubit state measurement as well .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we examine in detail the energy spectrum of the auxiliary qd structure attached to single qubit as well as the organization of conditional probe electron dynamics in that structure .",
    "this specific operation amounts to a single - qubit phase shift and can be used for implementation of controlled - phase shift of target qubit in two - qubit circuits and , therefore , for entanglement generation .",
    "section 3 describes the algorithm of nine - qubit shor encoding which exploits two - qubit gates based upon conditional probe electron evolution to entangle the qubits .",
    "auxiliary structure used in the algorithm is arranged from quasilinear qd chains considered in section 2 .",
    "we conclude our study by section 4 .",
    "in this section we study a way of how to manipulate the two - electron system composed of charge qubit and auxiliary structure by selective driving of one of its components , namely , of the probe electron localized in the as .",
    "as we shall see , the probe electron evolution in the as depends on the qubit state , and , in its turn , may change internal qubit phase . both aspects",
    "are important for an algorithm of entanglement production in many - qubit systems .",
    "consider the single - electron as composed of @xmath0 electrostatically defined qds @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) that are stacked in a quasilinear chain and separated by the finite potential barriers ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the structure parameters are chosen in such a way that the edge qd @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) contains at least two bound electron states , namelly , the well - localized ground state @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) and the excited state @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) lying closely to the barrier s top , while each internal qd @xmath1 [ @xmath9 contains at least one bound electron state @xmath10 .",
    "the qds @xmath3 and @xmath4 are supposed to be spatially isolated from each other so that the electron tunneling between the states @xmath11 and @xmath12 is negligibly small .",
    "if an electron occupies one of those states , it can stay there for extremely long time .",
    "we assume that the energies @xmath13 and @xmath14 of excited states of the edge qds and the energies @xmath15 of states of the internal qds are approximately equal to each other . given the tunnel coupling @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) between the states @xmath10 and",
    "@xmath18 is large as compared with the energy difference @xmath19 ( resonant tunneling condition ) , those states become hybridized . if this condition holds for any neighboring as qd states @xmath20 and @xmath21 , then the single electron tunneling between qds results in formation of a @xmath0-fold excited state subband .",
    "each state in that subband is a superposition of states @xmath10 ( @xmath2 ) and is thus delocalized over the as .",
    "here we imply that the ground states of edge qds do not hybridize with the excited states as long as @xmath22 .    if charge qubit is positioned along the structure axis @xmath23 , as shown in figure 1 , the energies of the as qd levels are shifted relative to their unperturbed values @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath15 by @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , respectively , due to the electron - electron interaction . for definiteness ,",
    "those shifts are completely associated with bare single - electron levels of the as qds .",

    "in particular , the tunneling collapse described above manifests itself in that the edge subband state with @xmath87 = 1 ( @xmath87 = @xmath0 ) splits off the subband and transforms at quite large positive ( negative ) values of @xmath76 ( @xmath100 ) into the isolated state of the qd @xmath4 with @xmath101 1 ( @xmath102 1 ) .",

    "therefore , the probe electron can be transferred from the qd @xmath3 via the as to any other qubit provided that this first ( control ) qubit is in the state `` one '' .",
    "thus , it makes possible to implement the controlled - phase operation on given pair of ( remote ) qubits .    in general , to perform a phase shift by an angle @xmath238 on the target qubit provided that the control qubit is in the state `` one ''",
    ", we have to implement conditional pet from initial qd of the structure to the qd positioned near control qubit ( if and only if its state is `` one '' ) .",
    "secondly , the conditional transfer from this near - to - control - qubit qd to the qd positioned near target qubit ( again , if and only if its state is `` one '' ) should be carried out . therefore , if the two - qubit state is @xmath239 , phase is accumulated in target qubit according to the scenario given in this section .",
    "if the two - qubit state is nt @xmath240 , the probe electron does nt go to target qubit and , therefore , phase is nt accumulated .",
    "it is equivalent to the transition from two - qubit state @xmath241 to state @xmath242^{ab}\\left| ab \\right\\rangle$ ] , where @xmath243 = ( 0 , 1 ) .",
    "it is known that any realistic quantum computational scheme should be protected from quantum errors caused by the environmental decoherence and the external control imperfections . for this purpose",
    ", one may use the quantum error correction codes converting individual qubit state into the specific entangled state of several qubits that , after decoding , restores initial single qubit state ( see , e.g. , the book of nielsen and chuang @xcite for detail ) . in this section",
    "we present the algorithm realizing the nine - qubit quantum error correction code developed by shor @xcite .",
    "the encoding procedure requires us to arrange the qubits in such a way that the interactions between them can be switched on / off on demand in controllable manner . making use of the results of sec .",
    "2 , we propose the following model of auxiliary structure to mediate the interqubit coupling and to assist the entanglement generation needed for the implementation of shor encoding ( see figure 6 ) .",
    "such an as incorporates three branches @xmath244 , @xmath245 , and @xmath246 each represented by a t - shaped qd structure .",

    "when a negative voltage is applied to one of those gates , the potential barrier separating the qd @xmath3 from corresponding branch grows exponentially , and the electron tunneling across the barrier quickly falls . as the calculations show the decrease of tunneling matrix element @xmath60 between two neighboring qds by two orders of magnitude is enough to treat those qds as isolated from each other .",
