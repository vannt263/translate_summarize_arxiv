    "all numerical studies that have been performed so far for understanding the shape transformations of membranes ignore the landau - ginzburg ( lg ) model @xcite , which is based on the usage of the surface tangential vector , and apply the helfrich - polyakov ( hp ) model @xcite , which is defined by means of the normal vector to the surface in @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the hp model includes the spring and beads model , of which the curvature energy is defined by the normal vector @xcite . to the contrary , the order parameter of the lg model is the tangential vector @xmath4 of the surface , the position of which is denoted by @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , the definition of the hp model is completely different from that of the lg model , and for this reason it is still unclear whether or not the numerical result of the hp model should be consistent with the theoretical prediction of the lg model .",
    "in fact , numerical simulations of the lg model are yet to be performed .",
    "we should mind that the curvature energy in the lg hamiltonian consists of the out - of - plane and in - plane bending components .",
    "in addition , an in - plane shear energy component is also included in the energy term of the fourth power of @xmath6 in the lg hamiltonian . in contrast , the hp hamiltonian has the extrinsic curvature energy without the in - plane shear energy component . for this reason ,",
    "the lg model is in sharp contrast to the hp model .",
    "moreover , we know that the existence of in - plane shear energy influences the order of the crumpling transition in the case of meshwork models @xcite . therefore , we consider it is a nontrivial problem to find out whether or not the order of the transition of the lg model is identical with that of the hp model",
    ".    it should also be minded that the order parameter @xmath6 forms the induced metric @xmath7 of the surface .",
    "this metric is closely related to the shape of triangles in the discrete model on triangulated surfaces , because @xmath6 just corresponds to the edge length of triangles .",
    "the regular triangle corresponds to the euclidean metric @xmath3 which is a special case of @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , the anisotropic shape transformation is a direct consequence of the anisotropic shape of triangles in the triangulated surface model @xcite .",
    "thus , the model of david - guitter ( dg ) is very interesting because it demonstrates the dependence of the transition on the shape of triangles @xcite .",
    "indeed , the dg hamiltonian includes the energy term of the strain tensor @xmath8 , which measures a difference between the induced metric and the euclidean metric .    in this paper , we numerically study the lg and dg models on triangulated surfaces .",
    "our aim is to find out whether the first - order transition is seen in the models or not and to find the dependence of the transition on the shape of triangles .",
    "both the self - avoiding and phantom surface models are studied .",
    "here the phantom model is the model of the surface that is allowed to self - intersect .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ lg - model ] , we study the lg model . the continuous lg model is introduced and the mean field description of the model is reviewed in subsection [ lg - continuous ] .",
    "the discretization of the lg model on triangulated surfaces is described in detail in subsection [ lg - discrete ] , and the mc results are shown in subsection [ lg - monte ] , where the first - order transition is confirmed .",
    "the mc results of the lg model in higher dimensions and those of the self - avoiding surfaces are briefly presented and discussed in subsection [ lg - sa - highdim ] . in section [ dg - model ] , we study the dg model",
    ". the continuous dg model is introduced , and a relation between the strain tensor and the surface metric is mentioned in subsection [ dg - continuous ] .",

    "the landau - ginzburg hamiltonian for membranes is given by @xcite @xmath10 the variable @xmath11 ) denotes a local coordinate of the surface .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath12 should be written as @xmath13 since @xmath14 is the order parameter , however , we here write @xmath15 as @xmath12 because @xmath5 is the dynamical variable of the model . the first term @xmath16 is identical to the gaussian bond potential in the hp model and represents the in - plane tensile elasticity , and the coefficient @xmath17 is the microscopic surface tension .",
    "the second term @xmath18 is the curvature energy with the bending rigidity @xmath19 .    here",
    "we comment on the difference between this @xmath18 and that of the hp model .",
