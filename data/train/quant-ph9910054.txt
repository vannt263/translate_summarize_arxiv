    "rapid advances of trapping and cooling of alkali atoms @xcite have led to the recent dramatic achievement of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) @xcite . focusing these",
    "highly successful trapping and cooling methods onto fermions instead of bosons offers additional rich opportunities for studying degenerate fermionic atomic gases .",
    "the description of these magnetically trapped fermi gases presents additional simplification as the pauli exclusion principle forbids the unsuppressed low energy s - wave collisions among atoms in the same hyperfine state .",
    "thus these dilute trapped atoms behave very close to the ideal fermi gas so ubiquitous in physics textbooks for decades .",
    "recent highlights from several leading experimental groups have indicated that we are at the edge of being able to explore quantum degenerate fermi gas @xcite inside laboratories .",
    "once such a degenerate gas is achieved , how do we perform diagnostic measurements on its properties ?",
    "a standard method in atomic physics is to probe the gas with light scattering .",
    "this is the problem to be addressed in our paper .",
    "these spectroscopic light scattering methods have already been suggested for bec in both the weak and strong field scattering regimes @xcite .",
    "these early theoretical investigations had limited impact on bec experimental observations so far , partly because the resonant photon - atom interaction becomes a complicated many body problem when a condensate is involved .",
    "the recent dramatic demonstration of low group velocity of light propagation inside a condensate @xcite , the bragg scattering experiment @xcite , and the surprising observation of super - radiant collective spontaneous emission from mit @xcite all call for more detailed applications of quantum field theory of photons interacting with atoms . in the last several years , light scattering off fermi degenerate atoms",
    "have already been discussed by several groups ; some of these investigations focused on the case of a distribution of ideal atoms obeying fermi - dirac statistics @xcite ; while others considered more exotic state for a cooper paired fermionic condensate @xcite .",
    "one notable feature for a fermi degenerate gas is that the pauli exclusion principle blocks ( inhibits ) scattering events for atoms into already occupied states @xcite .",
    "this paper aims at detailed quantitative information of light scattering from trapped fermi gases within parameter regimes of current / future experiments , specifically results explicitly demonstrating temperature and quantum statistical effects are sought .    in a previous paper involving two of us ( ly and ml ) an optical method for detection of the properties of bec",
    "was proposed @xcite .",
    "this detection involves the limiting case of scattering short but intense laser pulses from a system of cooled bosonic atoms in a trap . in particular , the case of laser pulses with areas of 2@xmath1",
    "was investigated .",
    "( the pulse area to be defined later is proportional to the integral of the slowly varying envelope of the electric field multiplied by the atomic dipole moment ) .",
    "it was shown that such pulses mainly cause cyclic rabi oscillations for atoms in their excited and ground states .",
    "thus to zero - th order involves no photon scattering ( except the stimulated interaction with the driving field ) .",
    "however , atoms can spontaneously emit photons while in their excited states , therefore , the previous zero - th order picture involving coherent evolution of all atoms can be interrupted by spontaneous emissions of individual atoms . thus scattered light from these emissions can be collected and their properties reflect to a certain degree the properties of the trapped atoms .",
    "it was shown that for the case of bec , above the critical temperature , @xmath2 , the coherent scattering is very weak and is predominately in the forward direction due to phase matching effects . however , below the critical temperature the number of scattered photons increases dramatically and the coherent scattering occurs within a solid angle determined by the size of the condensate .",
    "for sufficiently short @xmath3-pulses the system is preserved even below @xmath2 so that this method can be potentially used as a non - destructive probe of bec .",
    "this paper presents a continuation of our investigations to the case of a system of trapped _",
    "fermionic _ atoms . the ideal gas of a fermi - dirac distribution is considered in this paper .",
    "the static properties of harmonic trapped ideal fermionic atoms as considered by several groups previously will be used as inputs @xcite . the more subtle case involving a weak attractive interactions between atoms",
    "could potentially develop into a bcs type cooper paired condensate @xcite , and whose pulsed light scattering properties @xcite will be explored in a future publication . in the present study involving ideal non - interacting fermionic atoms",
    ", we do not expect to see a dramatic change in the spectrum as one cools the gas since no phase transition occurs in the trapped gases even at zero temperature .",
    "however , with a finite number of atoms ( say @xmath4 million ) and cooled far below the fermi temperature @xcite one does expect that the quantum statistics should play a role in the spectrum .",
    "indeed , we demonstrate that when number of atoms are sufficiently large such that coherent scattering dominates , spectrum of scattered light exhibits qualitative changes in its temperature dependence , a signature potentially useful to probe quantum degeneracy of the system .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows ; first we review the formulation as was presented previously @xcite for trapped bosons . in the second quantized form ,",
    "the only difference lies at the commutation relations between atomic operators .",
    "we then calculate the spectra of scattered light taking into account the fermionic nature of the atomic operators . in sect .",
    "ii , we present the formulation of our model system . the near resonant laser pulse is assumed to be intense so that its interaction with trapped atoms is taken to be the zeroth order coherent process for which exact analytical solutions for the dynamics of atomic operators are given . in sect .",
    "iii , the interaction of weak scattered light with trapped atoms is treated quantum mechanically with perturbation method .",
    "the zeroth order solution of atomic operators from sect .",
    "ii is used to evaluate the dynamics of scattered photons . in section iv",
    ", our new results for the total and differential spectrums of scattered photons are then displayed numerically .",
    "a discussion section follows where both the angular and spectral distributions are presented .",
    "we also find the total number of atoms scattered for typical experimental parameter sets .",
    "finally we conclude with a summary of the essential physics learned from this investigation . in the appendix",
    "we show how we can re - write the expression for the spectrum of the coherently scattered light in a form that is suitable for numerical calculation .",
    "as will become obvious by the introduction of many newly derived analytic formulae , the trapped fermion case is numerically far more difficult to calculate than the previous bosonic one . at low temperatures the fermionic system consists of many stacked energy levels @xcite whereas the bosonic system nicely condenses to a few of the lowest energy levels .",
    "also the numerical methods for infinite series summations used previously for bosons are only applicable for the high temperature regime of a fermi gas .",
    "new methods are therefore developed to cope with the additional difficulties of the fermionic system .",
    "the first few sections of this paper follows closely to the bec situation .",
    "initially the treatment is formally the same for both bosons and fermions , the only difference being the commutation relations .",
    "however , these differences become significant later especially with the calculation of the spectrum .",
    "we consider a system consisting of @xmath5 fermionic atoms confined in a trap interacting with light .",
    "let us write down its hamiltonian in the fock representation and in the second quantized form @xcite : @xmath6   \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\sum_{\\mu}\\int d{\\vec k}\\ ck\\ ; a^{\\dag}_{{\\vec k}\\mu}a_{{\\vec k}\\mu } .",

    "if the system is driven by a coherent laser pulse then we may neglect spontaneous emission effects during the pulse if the pulse is sufficiently short and intense .",

    "the pulses we intend to use should have duration @xmath37 ps or shorter , i.e. width @xmath38 hz .",
    "a first estimate shows that @xmath39 mhz , so that spontaneous emission may be neglected during the interaction time of the pulse with the atoms . the current estimate for single excitation spontaneous emission is a far better one than in the bosonic case as there is no bose enhancement .",
    "however , the fermionic nature may come into play at very low temperatures where the effective spontaneous emission rate will be greatly reduced due to suppression by the fermi sea of ground levels .",

    "we used the same curve formats as before for the three temperatures .",
    "we see that all three curves are almost on top of each other for angular ranges @xmath220 and @xmath221 , which corresponds to back - scattering regime . the single atom spectra @xmath222 are appreciable only within a frequency scale @xmath223 , much shorter than the frequency scale @xmath224 for any significant change in form functions @xmath225 and @xmath226 .",
    "thus , frequency dependence of form functions can not play a role in determining the behavior of the spectrum of the scattered photons .",
    "we approximate from eq.([spec_th ] ) that angular behavior of differential spectrum follows @xmath227 $ ] .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the decrease in the first peak is due to the increase of @xmath228 at large number of atoms and at low temperatures .",
    "the second peak is not affected since within the frequency scale of single atom spectra , the form function is already diminishingly small at those angles .",
    "the minus sign in @xmath229 is due to anti - commutation of fermionic atomic operators , thus is purely quantum statistical . in fig .",
    "[ fig09 ] we see that again all three curves follow one another closely .",
    "however they now possess a dip at the resonance frequency .",
    "because these spectrum consists of incoherent processes , unlike the case of coherent scattering at high temperatures , there is no phase matching effects .",
    "the dip in the frequency spectrum is mathematically due to the requirement that all the three temperature curves meet at @xmath230 equal zero . for this particular point",
    "the form functions and hence the spectra does not depend on the temperature , reminiscent of some kind of optical theorem @xcite .",
    "the total number of scattered photons is also directly observable in an experiment . by calculating the total number of scattered photons from a simple pulse excitation",
    "we can study its dependence on the temperature .",
    "we again separate these into coherent and incoherent components .",
    "the number of scattered photons scales as @xmath171 for the coherent case and as @xmath5 for the incoherent one . for larger numbers of atoms",
    "one expects that the scattering will be dominated by the coherent scattering in the short pulse limit . similarly , for low atom numbers , the incoherent scattering will become dominate and thus be observable when only few atoms are scattered .",
    "the coherent scattering becomes more dominant at lower temperatures for the system of one million atoms .",
    "our preference for a dominant coherent scattering is due to the more sensitive nature of the coherent scattering to changes in temperature .",
    "this is shown clearly in the following figure , fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] showing coherent and incoherent scattering as a function of the temperature for one million atoms .",
    "the coherent results are plotted as circles while squares denote the incoherent ones . for comparison",
    "the triangle plots are calculated using the maxwell - boltzmann distribution ( mbd ) for a classical gas .",
    "the coherent curve displays temperature - dependent sensitivity across the full range of temperatures both above and below @xmath231 . the incoherent curve , on the other hand , is flat across the entire range of temperatures that we used .",
    "as is expected , the mbd and fdd coherent curves are the same at high temperatures since quantum statistical nature of the atom becomes less important as @xmath232 is greater than @xmath215 .",
    "they start to deviate from each other for @xmath232 between @xmath120 and @xmath215 .",
    "this becomes very pronounced at very low temperatures when @xmath232 is less than one - tenth .",
    "the fdd curve ( circles ) displays a flattening off at very low temperatures . the mbd curve ,",
    "on the other hand , does not share this feature , but it displays a rapid increase in scattering at these low temperatures . thus the flattening off is caused by the fermionic nature of the atoms .",
    "previous work on a bosonic system displayed a dramatic increase scattering at these low temperatures .",
    "this flattening originates from the inhibition of spontaneous emission far below the fermi temperatures where the lower levels are  stacked \" so that spontaneous emission into these levels are forbidden by the pauli s exclusion principle @xcite .",
    "we have studied theoretically the scattering of intense short laser pulses off a system of cold atoms . we have presented a detailed theory of such processes .",
    "we have demonstrated that by scattering pulses of area @xmath3 one may observe signatures of fermionic degeneracy in a system of trapped atoms . in the regime of validity of our theory , @xmath3 pulses",
    "leave the system of trapped atoms practically unperturbed . at high temperatures",
    "when the average energy per atom is many times the fermi temperature @xmath233 the coherent scattering is very weak and occurs in a very narrow cone in the forward direction due to phase matching effects , which is the same effect as for the case of bosons @xcite .",
    "as the temperature @xmath183 becomes of order less than one half of @xmath231 , angular distributions of scattered coherent photons broadens as the influence of the phase matching effects are reduced .",
    "incoherent scattering is insensitive , in both angular and frequency spectra ( hence total photons scattered ) to the temperature at small atom numbers @xmath234 . for such small number of atoms incoherent scattering dominates and scattering of short laser pulses is weakly temperature dependent . on the other hand",
    ", we find for larger number of atoms ( @xmath235 atoms with other parameters chosen as in this study ) , the angular incoherent spectrum , as well as the total number of scattered photons , exhibit qualitative effects depending on temperature .",
    "the number of scattered photons increases as the system of atoms are cooled but the rate of this increase tails off as the fermionic nature sets in to suppress photon scattering events leading to atoms into already occupied motional states .",
    "this temperature dependent property is compared with results calculated for atoms obeying the maxwell - boltzmann statistics . in this case of distinguishable classical atoms , the number of scattered photons follow the fermionic system at high temperatures , as it should , but starts to deviate at low temperatures ( around one half of @xmath231 ) where it continues to increase at a higher rate .",
    "scattering of short laser pulses on a system of trapped atoms thus provides a useful method for detecting the temperature and hence degree of degeneracy of a fermionic system .",
