    "in order to connect a huge number of devices as an internet of things ( iot ) , individual devices have to be manufactured at low cost .",
    "in addition , to protect personal information , a stable security system must be implemented .",
    "a physically unclonable function(puf ) is considered to be one of the important mechanisms for providing a unique i d for each device at low cost .",
    "a puf outputs a response i d to a challenge signal .",
    "the origins of the puf signal come from process variations of transistors and circuits .",
    "many types of puf have been already proposed .",
    "an arbiter puf that uses the circuit delay is the most intensively investigated  @xcite .",
    "an sram - puf that uses the initial memory value of sram is considered the most advanced  @xcite .",
    "altera has announced its intention to implement an sram - puf unit in the company s high - end fpga .",
    "initial defects of memories  @xcite or trap sites in the transistor  @xcite can be also used to constitute a puf .",
    "the first puf based on ring oscillators ( ro - puf ) was presented by suh _",
    "et al_.  @xcite , in which the frequency difference between two ros is used as the puf output .",
    "the ro - puf has an advantage in that it can be implemented in commercial fpgas without difficulty and the stability is proved  @xcite .",
    "however , previous ro - pufs using the frequency difference between ro pairs have disadvantages : the number of ro pairs corresponds to the length of the i d , resulting that a large number of ros is required .",
    "thus , from viewpoint of iot which requires low - power other than low - cost , continuous running of ro of conventional ro - puf is not desirable .    because fpgas are widely used as the basic tools to implement designs ,",
    "fpga - based pufs are expected to protect the individual properties . here",
    "we propose a puf based on a ring oscillator ( ro ) using the initial waveform of the ro output just after the oscillation starts .",
    "we use an ro pair in which one ro is used for sampling of the other ro .",
    "because the frequency of ro ( @xmath0 1  ghz ) is much faster than the system clock ( @xmath0 50 - 100 mhz ) , the sampling process is finished within a couple of cycles of the system clock , resulting in fast i d generation and low power consumption .",
    "we tested our idea on altera cyclone v ( 28 nm ) , and xilinx ( spartan-6 and spartan-3e ) devices .",
    "our puf is flexible because there is no design constraint .",
    "we use a simple verilog circuit .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we discuss related works regarding the ro - puf . in section iii , we present our ro - puf using a starting wave of the ro output .",
    "experimental details and results are presented in section iv .",
    "section v is devoted to the performance evaluation of the proposed puf . in section",
    "vi , we discuss temperature dependence .",
    "section vii presents conclusions .",
    "the mechanism of previous proposed ro - pufs involves comparing frequencies between two ros , and the large frequency variance leads to robustness of ro - pufs . in the first proposal of an ro - puf  @xcite the best ro pair with large frequency difference is selected out of many ros , resulting in the requirement of a large number of ros .",
    "_ found that the ro frequency depends on the location on the fpga , and improved the reliability of an ro - puf by implementing each ro in one configurable logic block  @xcite .",
    "et al_. show a chain - like structure that enhances the frequency difference using the frequency difference of nearest neighbor ros  @xcite .",
    "et al_. proposed a more efficient ro - puf by considering the programmable delay lines  @xcite .",
    "there are many proposals regarding pufs based on fpga other than ro - pufs .",
    "et al_. proposed the butterfly - puf  @xcite and flip - flop(ff)-puf  @xcite .",
    "the butterfly - puf shows excellent performance of the hamming distance and small temperature dependence .",
    "the butterfly - puf uses a bistable state of two ffs and is an fpga version of the sram - puf .",
    "although the butterfly - puf shows excellent puf performance , precise symmetry is required in the bistable ff structure .",
    "et al_. proposed a puf using rs - ff  @xcite in which inhibition input of rs - ff is used to reflect the chip identity .",
    "these pufs require routing constraints or hard macro , resulting in lack of generality in the conventional use of fpga , in which various applications and ips are implemented at low cost .",
    "the ro - puf presented here requires neither routing constraint nor hard macro",
    ". circuits automatically implemented by fpga software are measured in three kinds of fpga devices .",
    "various puf performances are estimated .",
    "the origin of a puf is the process variation of transistors and circuits , and the previously proposed ro - pufs show that the process variations appear in the frequency of ros .",
    "the frequency difference among different ros means that the period of one cycle between rising edges differs depending on each ro .",
    "thus , it is natural to consider that the waveform difference of an ro can be used as the source of a puf .",
    "the ro begins to oscillate when the supply voltage is applied or the enable switch is on . when the initial output value of the ro is 0 , the time to first rising edge of oscillation signals differs depending on each ro .",
    "however , because the frequency of ros ( @xmath0 1  ghz ) is much higher than the clock frequency of the conventional circuit board ( @xmath0 50 - 100 mhz ) , the conventional ro set up shown in fig.1  ( a ) is insufficient to capture the oscillation signal . in order to capture the oscillation signal of the ro at higher time resolution",
    ", we use other ros as the sampling clock of ff . figure 1(b ) is the minimum unit of the proposed puf using the waveform of ros ( wro - puf ) . because the output frequency of fig.1(b ) is still high ,",
    "we need ffs to convert the higher - frequency signals to the lower - frequency digital data used in the other circuit .",
    "figure 2 is the basic unit of the wro - puf , where the number of ffs corresponds to the length of generated i d for this element .",
    "let us analyze the waveform of fig.1(b ) .",
    "figure 3 shows the two possible patterns of the initial waveforms of the two ros .",
    "when @xmath1 , the ros start to oscillate , and the initial value of ros is set to 0 by the nand element in fig.1(b ) .",
    "the time to the first rising edge differs depending on ros .",
    "when the period of the waveform of ro1 is longer than that of ro2 ( @xmath2 ) , the initial value of the output in fig.1(b ) is 0 .",
    "when @xmath3 , the initial value of the output in fig.1(b ) is 1 .",
    "the variation of the oscillation period depends on the properties of the transistors included in the ros .",
    "thus this mechanism resembles that of the conventional ro - pufs .",
    "moreover , because the waveforms are analog data , the relative difference @xmath4 between two waveforms is the origin of new degrees of freedom when they are digitized .",
    "figure  [ doublewave ] shows an example where the output signal ( out ) pattern of wro - puf greatly changes depending on the relative change @xmath5 even when we limit @xmath2 .",
    "if we take the first 32bits from these output signals , the number of the different bits between the two signals is 13 , which corresponds to the hamming distance of the two data .",
    "1 ghz ) is much higher than the clock frequency of the conventional circuits ( @xmath0 50 - 100 mhz ) .",
    "( b ) our proposed puf consists of two ros . in order to detect the high frequency output of ro1 , the output signal of ro1 is sampled by the output of ro2.,width=302 ]             and ( b ) @xmath6.,width=226 ]    we consider that the device i d of fpga consists of outputs of several ro pairs in fig .",
    "[ allcircuit ] .",
    "thus , the number of the ffs in fig .  [ allcircuit ] corresponds to the length of a unit i d component .",
    "because the frequency of ro is very high , it is considered that the sampling by ros is out of the conventional operational region of ffs . in particular , the change of signal in @xmath7 terminal is compatible with @xmath8 terminal , resulting in the difference of output depending on the chip .",
    "in addition , the output of fig .",
    "[ allcircuit ] is considered to be affected by the wire delay between the output of ro2 and ffs .",
    "this effect changes the periodic waveform to partly aperiodic waveform .",
    "this mechanism resembles the arbiter - puf or ff - puf .",
    "thus , our wro - puf generates i d from the causes of ro - puf ( transistor variation ) and the arbiter - puf(circuit variation ) .",
    "generate 256-bit length i d of the fpga . in this case",
    ", the number of ros in an fpga is 16 and the number of ffs is @xmath9.,width=226 ]        table i +   details of the datasets used .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     , @xmath10 , @xmath11 ... show the fpga device names , width=283 ]",
    "we evaluate the puf performance of our wro - puf based on the metrics discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the results of the evaluation are shown in table ii . here , uniqueness is calculated from @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the number of the tested devices , @xmath14 is the length of the i d , and @xmath15 is the i d pattern that appears most frequently .",
    "reliability is calculated from @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the number of times sampling is done .",
    "uniformity is calculated from @xmath18 the average results over all samples are listed in table ii .    the uniformity and the reliability are close to the desirable values , whereas the uniqueness is smaller than the ideal value .",
    "when we see that the arbiter - puf shows smaller values of the uniqueness from ref.@xcite , the small value of the uniqueness is considered to come from the arbiter - puf performance , because our puf is a combination of the ro - puf and the arbiter - puf .            c. the i d linearly changes as the temperature difference from 20  @xmath19c increases .",
    "( b ) the temperature dependence of the 16-bit counter of fig .  [ system ] for two ros of two spartan-3e devices .",
    "the count linearly decreases as the temperature rises .",
    "the temperature dependence of the count is different depending on ros and devices .",
    "this means that the temperature measurement can be combined with the output of the ro pair .",
    ", width=321 ]",
    "in general , as the temperature rises , ro frequency linearly decreases . similarly , the change of supplied voltage affects the puf outputs . in order to use ro - puf",
    ", we have to take into account the effects of these environmental changes . the general solution to the changing i d",
    "is to add some feedback circuit to the puf system  @xcite .",
    "however , for the low - cost puf and fpga - puf , an analog circuit is not preferable .",
    "the simple solution to this problem is to detect the environmental change and provide ids that also change according to the environment .",
    "figure  [ system ] shows our proposed circuit .",
    "we prepare the 3rd ro , ro3 , whose frequency is estimated by a counter and shows the status of the environment  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ temperature](a ) shows the average hd from the i d at 20  @xmath19c in the case of sampling done more than thousand times .",
    "as can be seen , the i d tends to change linearly as the temperature difference from 20  @xmath19c increases .",
    "the small temperature change would be correctable by an error - correcting code .",
    "figure  [ temperature](b ) shows the count of the ro3 in fig .  [ system ] .",
    "it can be seen that the count has clear linear dependence on the temperature . when the ro3 is closely placed near the wro - puf",
    ", the change of the physical environment of wro - puf is correctly detected by the count of the ro3 .",
    "thus , in our scheme , by collating the count of ro3 ( temperature i d ) to the puf - id , we can check the correct i d of the device .",
    "we proposed a ro - puf using the initial waveform ( wro - puf ) accompanied by a temperature detection system that is also constituted by ros .",
    "although it is preferable that puf units are placed compactly in the small area of the fpga cell to avoid extra noises by the global wires in the fpgas , the wro - puf is implemented just by downloading a verilog circuit , without any manual routing .",
    "we proved the wro - puf is applicable to various fpgas of altera and xilinx .",
