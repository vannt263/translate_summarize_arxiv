    "highly excited sextet states in five - electron ions provide a form of energy storage .",
    "the research for stimulated vuv- and x - ray emission from highly excited sextet states in five - electron ions has attracted attention in recent years .",
    "this new form of energy storage and potential vuv - ray lasers could have many applications in basic science , technology , medicine , and defense . in a proposed vuv and x - ray laser system ,",
    "one seeks a probability to trigger a release of k- and l - hole energies of sextet states in boron - like ions . although k- and l - hole energies are not as high as energies released in nuclear fusion , capacity of highly excited sextet states in five - electron ions to store energy is significant ( several hundred electron volts per atom shown in fig .",
    "such a system involves long - lived  storage  metastable states , and there nearby are short - lived higher excited sextet states , from which transitions are emitted with photon radiation , and quintet continuum .",
    "an ideal system where vuv and x - ray lasers may be implemented would be among heavy and highly excited ions that have metastbale sextet states with long lifetimes .",
