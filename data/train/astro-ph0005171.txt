    "when butcher & oemler ( 1978 , 1984 ) discovered an excess of galaxies bluer than the elliptical sequence in clusters at @xmath5 , nothing was known about the galactic morphologies at such large distances .",
    "the first evidence of the disky / spiral nature of the butcher - oemler galaxies came from high - resolution ground - based imagery which also found several cases of galaxies with disturbed morphologies and/or close neighbors ( thompson 1986 , 1988 , lavery & henry 1988 , 1994 , lavery , pierce & mcclure 1992 ) .    over the past five years , thanks to the high spatial resolution imaging achieved with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst ) _ , it has been established that the morphological properties of galaxies in rich clusters at intermediate redshift differ dramatically from those in nearby clusters .",
    "the most obvious difference is the overabundance of spirals in the cluster cores at @xmath6 ( couch et al .",

    "the spiral population in the distant clusters consist of the great majority of the blue galaxies responsible for the butcher - oemler effect , as well as a sizeable fraction of the _ red population ( dressler et al .",
    "1999 [ morphs ] , poggianti et al .",
    "1999 [ morphs ] ) . a considerable proportion of these spirals have disturbed morphologies , in some cases quite clearly as the result of an ongoing merger / interaction while in others possibly connected to some other dynamical mechanism ( e.g. interaction with the hot intracluster medium or the cluster tidal field , moore et al .",
    "1996 , 1998 , abadi et al .",
    "_    the second major piece of evidence for morphological evolution in clusters was uncovered only from post - refurbishment data : coupled to the increase in the spiral fraction , the s0 galaxies at intermediate redshifts are proportionately ( x23 ) _ less abundant than in nearby clusters , while the fraction of ellipticals is already as large or larger ( d97 , s97 ) .",
    "this result strongly suggests that a large number of the cluster spirals observed at @xmath7 have evolved into the s0 s that dominate the cores of rich clusters today ( d97 , couch et al .",
    "1998 , van dokkum et al .",
    "1998 , but see andreon 1998 for a different view ) .",
    "thus the disk galaxy populations appear to be greatly affected by the cluster environment , while the ellipticals in dense regions seem to have changed little since @xmath8 as far as both their abundance and their stellar populations are concerned ( van dokkum & franx 1996 , andreon , davoust & heim 1997 , d97 , ellis et al .  1997 ( morphs ) , kelson et al .",

    "morphological studies at redshift greater than 0.6 have been limited to three clusters so far , pointing to a low fraction of early - type galaxies in two clusters at @xmath9 ( lubin et al .",
    "1998 , van dokkum et al .",
    "2000 ) , a high early - type galaxy fraction in a cluster at z=0.9 ( lubin et al . 1998 ) and a surprisingly high rate of mergers in a cluster at z=0.83 ( van dokkum et al .",
    "_    further proof of the changes occurring in clusters is the observed evolution of the morphology - density ( md ) relation  the correlation between galaxy morphology and local projected density of galaxies that dressler ( 1980a , d80a ) found _ in all types of clusters _ at low redshift , whereby the elliptical fraction increases and the spiral fraction decreases with increasing local galaxy density . an md relation qualitatively similar to that found by d80a was discovered by d97 to be present _ in regular clusters and absent in irregular ones at @xmath8_. interestingly , the incidence of ellipticals is already very high in all the distant clusters regardless of their dynamical status , therefore the formation of the ellipticals must occur independently of and before cluster virialization ( d97 ) .",
    "overall , the available data seem to require a strong morphological evolution in clusters between @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "still , it is worth keeping in mind that these conclusions , although grounded on high - quality data obtained with a monumental observational effort , are based on a `` small '' sample of distant clusters and on the comparison of a limited redshift range around @xmath12 with the present - day cluster populations ( dressler 1980b , d80b ) . clearly the @xmath13 regime - which up until now has remained largely unexplored - is crucial for a better understanding of the progression of galaxy evolution in dense environments . at these moderate redshifts ,",
    "performing an analysis comparable to that of the morphs requires either ground - based ccd imaging taken over quite a large field under excellent seeing conditions , or a time - consuming mosaic coverage with _",
    "hst_.    the goal of this paper is to begin to fill in the observational gap between the distant clusters observed with _",
    "hst _ and the nearby clusters , and hence trace , for the first time , the evolution of the morphological mix at a look - back time of @xmath14 gyr .",
    "in addition , by enlarging the sample of clusters whose galactic morphologies have been studied in detail , we hope to shed some light on the dependence of the observed evolutionary trends on the cluster properties .",
    "we present ground - based , good - seeing images of the central regions of 9 clusters at @xmath15 (  2 ) and we perform a detailed morphological analysis of the galaxies in these clusters (  3 ) . we study the relative occurrence of ellipticals , s0 s and spirals as a function of the cluster properties and we compare them with similar studies at lower and higher redshift (  4 ) .",
    "finally , we examine the morphology - density relation of the total sample and of the high- and low - concentration clusters separately (  5 ) and we present our conclusions in  6 . throughout this paper",

    "in order to evaluate the errors associated with background subtraction , we have computed the changes in the morphological fractions that occur if the field correction for each cluster and galactic type is varied by an amount equal to the correction itself ( 100% error , see table  5 available in cd - rom form ) .",
    "the variation in the morphological fractions is on average 0.03 , ranging between 0.01 and 0.08 . in figs .",
    "9 and 10 the errorbars represent the poissonian errors due to the small numbers of galaxies and are typically greater than 0.1 .",
    "therefore the poissonian errors always dominate over the errors due to field subtraction .    in spite of the large errors ,",
    "it is clear from these figures that there are systematic trends with z : the spiral fraction declines and the s0 fraction rises in going towards lower redshifts .",
    "the morphological fractions in our clusters are intermediate between the high and the low redshift values and seem to trace a continuous change of the abundance of s0 and spiral galaxies .",
    "in contrast , the elliptical fraction ( top panel in fig .",
    "9 ) shows no particular trend with redshift , but rather a large scatter from cluster to cluster at any epoch .",
    "the mirror - like trends of the s0 and spiral fractions ( figures  9b , c ) are well represented by the behaviour of the s0/sp ratio in fig",
    ".  10b . from this",
    ", we can confidently argue that , as the redshift becomes lower , the s0 population tends to grow at the expense of the spiral population .",
    "figure  10a suggests the existence of a large intrinsic scatter in the s0/e ratio , which , at least within our sample , can be mostly ascribed to the different cluster morphologies : clusters showing a marked concentration of ellipticals in the central region have lower s0/e ratios with respect to the clusters in which e galaxies are more or less uniformly distributed inside the cluster area .",
    "a similar tendency is possibly seen at higher redshift as well and at low redshift comparing elliptical - rich and s0-rich clusters .",

    "square weighted fits ( 0.09@xmath76z@xmath760.65 ) to the hec and lec clusters , respectively . in spite of the scatter ,",
    "likely due to the intrinsic dependency of the s0/e ratio on the cluster morphology , the trend with redshift found by d97 ( full line in figure  10a ) turns out to be confirmed .",

    "the local densities have been computed  following d80a and d97  in a rectangular area containing the 10 nearest neighbors . in figure  11",
    "we present the local density distributions of galaxies of the different morphological types ( upper panels ) , together with the corresponding distributions of morphological fractions ( lower panels ) for our global cluster sample ( leftmost panels ) , as well as the @xmath62 and @xmath61 sub - samples ( middle and rightmost panels ) .",
    "number and fraction of galaxies of different morphological types as a function of the local density for the 9 clusters in our sample ( leftmost panels ) and for the sub - samples of @xmath62 ( middle panels ) and @xmath61 ( rightmost panels ) clusters .",
    "the distributions of elliptical , s0 and spiral galaxies are indicated with a full line , a dotted line and a shaded histogram , respectively .    apart from the different value of the global s0/sp ratios , our distributions ( fig .",
    "11d , e and f ) look qualitatively very similar to those of the morphs sample ( figs .  4 ,  5 and  6 in d97 ) , particularly if we compare our @xmath61 and @xmath62 cluster families with the high- and low - concentration families in d97 . as in the higher redshift clusters ,",
    "a morphology - density relation is present in highly concentrated clusters and absent in the low concentration clusters where a possible small _ anticorrelation _ can be noted both here and in d97 .",
    "the fact that the density distributions at @xmath79 resemble those at @xmath80 much more closely than those at @xmath81 could suggest that the morphology - density relation in low concentration clusters was established in the last 1 - 2 gyr , but a definite conclusion can not be reached on the basis of the available data .",
    "another remarkable feature of the md distributions is that , moving from high redshift to the intermediate redshift regime , the fraction of es as a function of the local density appears to be practically unchanged for both @xmath61 and @xmath62 clusters , i.e. the elliptical - density relations at @xmath82 are also _ quantitatively _ similar to that of the morphs sample at @xmath83 .",
    "we also note that the @xmath62 distributions remain relatively flat over this redshift interval , while a strong increase in the s0/sp fraction takes place ( compare our fig .",
    "12e with fig .  8 in d97 ) .",
    "this suggests that in the @xmath62 clusters the sp@xmath84s0 transformation process is highly efficient and that the efficiency is largely independent of local density .",
    "in contrast , the s0 and spiral  density distributions in @xmath61 clusters at the two different redshifts ( compare our fig .",
    "11f with fig .  6 in d97 ) , have quite different slopes , suggesting that the process of transfer from spirals to s0s is more efficient in low density regions than in high density ones .",
    "the above analysis is based on the comparison of two rather small cluster samples and , therefore , it needs to be confirmed by the morphological study of more sizeable samples .",
    "nevertheless , there is the suggestion that , at least in our range of observed local densities ( 1.3@xmath852.4 ) , the efficiency of the possible transition from spiral to s0 morphology seems to increase with decreasing local density .",
    "finally , the fact that no md relation is found in our @xmath62 clusters demonstrates that the dichotomy in the s0/e ratio discussed in the previous section can not merely be ascribed to a universal md relation at @xmath82 combined with different density ranges for the @xmath61 and @xmath62 clusters : the two types of clusters are intrinsically different both in their global morphological content and in the arrangement of the morphological types as a function of the local density .",
    "\\1 ) the morphological properties of the galaxy populations in nine clusters at @xmath86 are found to be intermediate between those at @xmath87 and those at low - z , with a moderate spiral content and a moderate `` deficiency '' ( as compared to lower redshifts ) of s0 galaxies .",
    "our results support the evolutionary scenario , inferred from higher redshift studies ( d97 , s97 , couch et al .",
    "1998 ) , involving the disk galaxy populations in which there is a progressive morphological conversion in clusters , from spirals into s0 s .",
    "\\2 ) at @xmath55 , we find a dichotomy in the relative occurrence of s0 and elliptical galaxies : four of our clusters display a low s0/e ratio ( @xmath88 ) while two of our clusters have a significantly higher ratio ( @xmath89 ) similar to the other clusters in our sample at @xmath90 .",
    "the most likely interpretation of this dichotomy and of the large scatter in the s0/e ratio at @xmath55 is that such a ratio is both a function of the redshift and of the cluster `` type '' , being significantly lower in clusters with a strong central concentration of elliptical galaxies .",
    "\\3 ) at @xmath13 a morphology - density relation exists only for the high - concentration clusters and is absent in the low - concentration ones .",
    "the same result was found at @xmath80 ( d97 ) , while at low redshift the correlation between galaxy morphology and local density is present in all types of clusters of the d80a sample .",
    "although the number of galaxies is too small to draw definite conclusions , these results seem to suggest that the morphology - density relation in low - concentration clusters was established only in the last 1 - 2 gyr , but only additional data and a homogeneous systematic analysis both at low and moderate redshifts will clarify this matter .",
    "moreover , comparing our md relations with the corresponding ones at @xmath80 ( d97 ) , we suggest that the efficiency of the sp@xmath84s0 transformation process anticorrelates with the local density .",
    "the relation between the s0/e ratio and the spatial concentration of the ellipticals is not surprising in the light of the well - known correlations between the galaxy content and the cluster type in low - redshift clusters .",
    "as mentioned in  4 , oemler ( 1974 ) grouped clusters in three classes : spiral - rich ( sr ) , elliptical - rich ( er , the most spherical in shape and concentrated ) and s0-rich ( s0r , named `` spiral - poor '' by o74 , `` not quite as centrally concentrated as the er class , but more regular than the sr class '' ) .",
    "interestingly , o74 suggested that s0-rich clusters are dynamically evolved clusters ( they already show segregation by mass and morphological type ) representing a later evolutionary stage of spiral - rich clusters , following the evolution of a significant fraction of the spiral galaxies into s0 s . in contrast , in the scenario proposed by o74 , e - rich clusters are well evolved but _ intrinsically different from the s0r clusters : although possibly the dynamically oldest type of clusters , their high elliptical content implies that they did not evolve from the spiral - rich clusters and is likely due to an enhanced formation rate of ellipticals in regions that began as the densest fluctuations in the early universe .",
    "_    we speculate that in our sample at @xmath91 , the four clusters with a strong central concentration of ellipticals ( and the lowest s0/e ratios ) are presumably the analogues ( and progenitors ) of the low - z e - rich clusters ( see the extrapolation at low redshift of dotted line in figure  10a ) , while the low - concentration clusters ( with the highest s0/e ratio ) seem to be the analogues of the `` s0-rich '' clusters .",
    "the effects of redshift ( evolution ) and cluster type are expected to mingle in various proportions at the different epochs .",
    "following o74 , we suggest that the relative occurrence of s0 s and spirals is mostly linked with the `` maturity '' of the cluster with spirals progressively evolving into s0 s , while the ellipticals are well in place at redshifts greater than those considered here and their abundance and concentration reflect an `` original imprinting '' ( see also d97 ) . then , the s0/sp ratio should be related to the evolutionary epoch of the cluster and the s0/e value should be determined both by the epoch and the cluster type ( nurture and nature , in a way ) , with the redshift being the dominant effect at early epochs .",
    "all types of clusters are expected to display a low s0/e ratio ( with smaller fluctuations among the different types of clusters ) , as indeed is observed in the morphs dataset , simply because many of the s0 s have not yet formed . ]",
