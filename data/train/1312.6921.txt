    "unconventional superconductivity@xcite is now ubiquitous in strongly correlated electron systems , such as cuprate@xcite , pnictide@xcite and heavy fermion compound@xcite .",
    "however , theoretical understanding of those unconventional superconductors and its underlying pairing mechanism are still rather uncompleted despite extensive and intensive study in the past decades .",
    "the common belief of superconductivity is that the superconducting state results from the pairing instability of original non - superconducting normal state .",
    "this is implicitly assumed in the classic bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) theory where the usual fermi liquid state plays the role of the non - superconducting background state.@xcite thus , logically and in principle a non - fermi liquid normal phase might lead to a corresponding unconventional superconducting phase if exists .",
    "recently , the simplest non - fermi liquid called orthogonal metal , which has similar thermal and transport properties of the conventional landau fermi liquid but with gapped single - particle excitation , has proposed based on the study of @xmath0 slave - spin representation.@xcite some extensions have been investigated in detail by mean - field theory or by exactly soluble models constructed.@xcite    in light of those minimal non - fermi liquid metallic states , we explore a @xmath0 fractionalized bcs superconducting state , which could be considered as a minimal extension of usual bcs framework .",
    "it is found that this state has similar thermal and transport properties but its single - particle feature strongly deviates from the coherent quasiparticle behavior in the usual bcs state . the signature of such @xmath0 bcs state is the absence of the bcs coherent peak and instead a kink in the local density of state ( dos ) occurs at the position of the coherent peaks .",
    "this result in principle could be probed by scanning tunneling microscopy@xcite or point - contact spectroscopy experiments .",
    "we emphasize that this new feature has not been reported in existing literature and is the main finding of the present paper .",
    "to make further insight into such a @xmath0 bcs state , we present an exactly soluble model that realize the desirable @xmath0 fractionalized bcs superconducting state .",
    "we find the superfluid density is consistent with the usual bcs state but the coherent peaks are absent .",
    "to contact with realistic lattice models in condensed matter physics , the @xmath0 slave - spin representation@xcite is applied to the extended hubbard or @xmath4 model .",
    "@xcite the proposed @xmath0 bcs phase may be stable fixed points in the phase diagram if the pairing structure has full gap or a small number nodes at underlying fermi surface .",
    "the usual uniform s - wave and @xmath5-wave fulfill such requirement and even chiral @xmath6/@xmath7 are possible as well .",
    "in addition , the prototypical wave - function of such fractionalized bcs state is also proposed , which could be utilized by numerical techniques .",
    "the relations among @xmath0 bcs states , @xmath8@xcite and parent orthogonal metals are also analyzed .",
    "interestingly , we argue the weak and strong coupling pairing mechanism of @xmath0 bcs state , which implies a link among fermi liquid , orthogonal metal and gauge - theory description . since the parent orthogonal metals and the proposed @xmath0 bcs phase have not been found experimentally , we have to expect they may be realized in the exactly soluble models in terms of the versatile cold - atom simulations.@xcite if such experiments are available , the theoretical predictions are the mentioned absence of coherent peaks , the occurrence of a kink in dos and the normal behavior of superfluid density response .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sec2 ] , we introduces an exactly soluble model to illustrate the idea of the @xmath0 fractionalized bcs state and the local dos and superfluid density are calculated . in sec.[sec3 ] , we study the extended hubbard or @xmath4 model with the help of the @xmath0 slave - spin representation",
    ". the interesting prototypical wave - function of the fractionalized bcs is given in sec.[sec4 ] .",
    "finally , we end this work with a brief conclusion in sec.[sec5 ] .",
    "firstly , let us consider the following exactly soluble model to illustrate the idea of the @xmath0 fractionalized bcs state.[extension to other lattices like honeycomb and triangular lattices is straightforward and we do not present it in this paper . ]",

    "@xmath0 field @xmath12 are usual pauli matrices defined on the link of lattice and @xmath13-term serves as the kinetic energy while @xmath3-term acts like a potential ( @xmath14 denotes four nearest - neighbor sites , i.e. @xmath15 ) .",

    "however , @xmath24 is not the original electron operator but just the auxiliary fermion , so properties of physical electrons are determined by combined auxiliary fermion @xmath25 ( omitting the subscript ) with the ising spin @xmath26 . for the quantum ising model @xmath11 , there exist two phases characterized by the order parameter @xmath27 when @xmath28 ( the paramagnetic phase ) and @xmath29 if @xmath30 ( the ferromagnetic phase ) .",
    "meanwhile , a second - order quantum phase transition exists between these two phases whose critical behaviors belong to the 3d ising universal class.@xcite therefore , the ferromagnetic phase of ising spin implies a usual bcs superconducting state since @xmath31 with nonzero quasiparticle weight @xmath32 .",
    "in contrast , the paramagnetic phase leads to a distinct bcs state because of coherence of electron and auxiliary fermion is lost due to gapped ising spin @xmath27 .",
    "we state that the system with @xmath33 still corresponds a bcs state since the auxiliary fermion @xmath25 is always in the bcs state and it contributes physical thermal and transport behaviors as usual bcs states .",
    "in fact , the system with gapped ising spins should be considered as a @xmath0 fractionalized bcs state .",
    "this can be seen as follows .",
    "firstly , the extended kitaev toric code model @xmath10 in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) is known to have the @xmath0 gauge structure since the @xmath0 gauge transformation operator @xmath34 is commuted with the hamiltonian eq.([eq1]).@xcite then , when @xmath28 , the dual ising spin has @xmath27 and this relates to the vanishing small contribution of @xmath13 term in @xmath10 .",

    "combined with the performed bcs state of @xmath36 fermions , we have obtained a @xmath0 fractionalized bcs phase .",
    "since the observable thermal and transport properties of such @xmath0 bcs phase are dominated by the auxiliary fermion part and the ising spin is gapped and incoherent in this phase , we expect the single particle feature , e.g. , local density of state , should show strongly deviation from the coherent quasiparticle behavior in the usual bcs state . [",
    "although the @xmath0 fractionalized bcs state has the elusive topological order@xcite in contrast to the usual bcs one , this property is rather hard to be detected by current experimental techniques . ]      the local dos of physical electrons is calculated by @xcite @xmath37,\\label{eq3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 , @xmath39 are the dos for ising spin @xmath40 and auxiliary fermion @xmath25 .

[ ] , the dos is calculated for the slave - rotor approach . ] for the ising spin is gapped in the @xmath0 bcs phase , its dos can be approximated as @xmath41 with @xmath42 being the gap of ising spin . in the disordered states of ising spins ,",
    "its green function reads @xmath43.@xcite one integrates it over momentum @xmath44 and can obtain the dos .",
    "the dos of auxiliary fermions has the usual bcs superconducting expression , which reads @xmath45 for uniform s - wave pairing states and @xmath46 for @xmath5-wave superconducting phase with @xmath47 denoting the dos at fermi energy .",
    "interestingly , we obtain an analytical formalism for the electron dos in the s - wave case as @xmath48    we have shown the dos of physical electrons for uniform s - wave pairing in fig.[fig:1 ] and @xmath5-wave in fig.[fig:2 ] with parameters superconducting gap @xmath49 , ising - spin gap @xmath50 and @xmath51 . from figs.[fig:1 ] and [ fig:2 ] , we observe that the well - known bcs coherent peak of the local dos is absent in the @xmath0 fractionalized superconducting state .",
    "this suppression of the bcs coherent peak is due to the incoherent ( gapped ) ising spin , which destroys the superconducting quasiparticle behaviors such as the mentioned bcs coherent peak .",
    "usually , the location of the bcs quasiparticle coherent peak implies the value of superconducting gap particularly in realistic experiments . as for the @xmath0 fractionalized bcs state , we find that the local dos of physical electrons has a kink structure exactly at energy @xmath52 as what can be seen in figs.[fig:1 ] and [ fig:2 ] and eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) .",
    "such emergent kind structure is the reminiscent of the whole gap formed by both ising - spin and auxiliary - fermion .",
    "thus , one can encode the total value of the ising - spin gap @xmath42 and the superconducting gap @xmath53 in spite of the lack of the usual bcs coherent peak .",
    "if certain realistic materials are true @xmath0 fractionalized bcs state , and for the purpose of explicitly extracting the value of these two gaps , a useful method is to fit the superfluid density data with the effective one - band and/or two band bcs model@xcite .",
    "after such fit , the superconducting gap @xmath53 can be extracted and combining with the result of local dos , the ising - spin gap @xmath42 could be finally obtained .    for completeness",

    "we should remind the reader that this normalized superfluid density totally comes from the auxiliary fermion @xmath25 and has the identical formalism in either usual bcs or @xmath0 bcs phase as expected from the study of orthogonal metal and related issues .",

    "interestingly , if tuning the ising spin part @xmath11 into its quantum critical point , one will have a critical bcs state following the discussion in last subsection .",
    "note that we do not call it critical @xmath0 bcs state since the @xmath0 deconfined feature of the original @xmath0 gauge field is lost at criticality .",
    "since the ising spin is critical , its green function may be approximated as @xmath64 with @xmath65 being the critical exponent of 3d ising universal class.@xcite thus , the dos of ising spin reads @xmath66\\sim \\omega^{\\eta}$ ] .",
    "the corresponding local dos is shown in figs.[fig:5 ] and [ fig:6 ] for s - wave and @xmath5-wave pairing structure , respectively . without surprise , we find that the bcs coherent peak is lost and there exists a kink structure at @xmath67 in the critical bcs state .",
    "therefore , the qualitative physics is similar to the result of the @xmath0 bcs state , however we do not expect any topological order in this critical bcs state due to the gaplessness .     the local dos of critical s - wave bcs phase ( @xmath59 ) . for comparison ,",

    ", we use the @xmath0 slave - spin representation to split the physical electron @xmath70 into an auxiliary fermion @xmath25 and an ising - spin @xmath26 as @xmath71 .",
    "the auxiliary fermion @xmath25 carries all physical quantum number of electrons while the ising - spin @xmath26 denoting the collective coherent motion , thus no spin - charge separation is introduced at this level in contrast to the slave - boson or slave - rotor approach.@xcite utilizing the @xmath0 slave - spin representation with the constraint @xmath72 enforced in every site , eq.([eq5 ] ) is transformed into @xmath73 where @xmath74 . here",

    "obviously , @xmath22 remains an interacting hamiltonian though we have used a mean - field approximation .",
    "since we are interested in the possible superconducting phase and have no ambition to establish the whole phase diagram of eq.([eq7 ] ) , we could phenomenologically add a pairing term @xmath85 $ ] into it .",
    "[ actually , the antiferromagnetic @xmath3 term is able to induce the superconducting pairing based on the resonance - valence - bond ( rvb ) picture@xcite or antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation framework@xcite . ] therefore , the auxiliary fermion hamiltonian @xmath22 has a similar expression as the one in eq.([eq2 ] ) but with extra antiferromagnetic spin - density - wave mean - field term ( the term with @xmath3 below ) , @xmath86.\\label{eq8}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    now , it is easy to see that when the ising spin is condensed ( @xmath87 ) , the system is in the usual bcs phase due to nonzero overlaps between physical electrons @xmath70 and auxiliary fermion @xmath25 ( @xmath88).[the antiferromagnetic spin - density - wave mean - field term does not introduce interesting physics , so we will not cover it in the following discussion .",
    "] however , if the ising spin is disordered / gapped ( @xmath89 ) , we still have a superconducting state but its single - particle behaviors are suppressed due to incoherent ising spins as what is shown in last section . as a matter of fact",
    ", this superconducting state could be just the wanted @xmath0 fractionalized bcs state as can be seen as follows .    to demonstrate the @xmath0 fractionalized bcs state",
    ", we only have to verify that it is in the deconfined phase of @xmath0 gauge field since it is always superconducting . here , it is useful to use the action formalism of ref . [ ] to achieve our goal , where the dynamical @xmath0 gauge field @xmath90 is introduced to reflect the fluctuation beyond the mean - field level , @xmath91 where @xmath92 is a compact u(1 ) gauge field and summation over the the integer - valued auxiliary field @xmath93 enforces @xmath90 to be a true @xmath0 field .",
    "the trivial berry phase term of @xmath92 is neglected since it does not change the universal low - energy physics .",
    "furthermore , the ising - spin term can also be dropped out due to gapped ising spins in this phase .",
    "thus , one may integrate over auxiliary fermions but this process turns out to be not trivial . if @xmath36 forms the full gapped superconducting phase such as the uniform s - wave pairing state , the integration can be done without any singularity and we have the bf term below @xmath94 such bf term is known to well describe the universal low - energy physics of @xmath0 gauge theory at its deconfined phase.@xcite therefore , gaped ising spins and s - wave pairing bcs state of auxiliary fermions indeed corresponds to the @xmath0 fractionalized bcs state .",
    "but , if the superconducting phase of auxiliary fermions is gapless , we can not perform the integration safely and exactly.@xcite this is just the terrible problem encountered in gauge - theory description of high temperature superconductivity,@xcite quantum magnetism@xcite and @xmath95 quantum hall effect.@xcite for our interested @xmath5-wave case , its low - energy excitation is the dirac fermion at @xmath96 and the corresponding low - energy description reads @xmath97.\\label{eq11}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as argued by senthil and fisher,@xcite the topological order ( nontrivial ground - state degeneracy on closed manifold ) of deconfined @xmath0 gauge theory survives when the matter field has a linearly gapless spectrum ( the dirac fermions here are belong to this case ) .",
    "this means that the bf term is stable even when the gauge field @xmath98 is coupled to gapless dirac fermion @xmath99 .",
    "[ bf term encodes the topological order and vice - versa . ] therefore , even @xmath5-wave state of auxiliary fermions leads to the expected @xmath0 structure .",
    "so , combining the cases of s- and @xmath5-wave above , we conclude that the disordered ising spins with s- or nodal d - wave states of auxiliary fermions represents the desirable @xmath0 fractionalized bcs state .",
    "following this logic , there may exist @xmath0 fractionalized bcs states with the chiral @xmath6 or @xmath7 pairing@xcite since those pairing structures are generically gapped or only has a small number of nodes .    for physical observable",
    ", we expect that the local dos of @xmath0 fractionalized bcs state found in the extended hubbard model should be similar to the one in last section , in which the coherent bcs peak are absent . the thermodynamic quantity , e.g. , specific heat , and transport behavior such as the superfluid density are similar to the usual bcs superconductors .",
    "in the main text , we have study the possible @xmath0 fractionalized bcs state in both exactly soluble models and the extended hubbard model , but it is interesting to ask what is the many - body wave - function of such fractionalized bcs state ? based on the study in ref . [ ] and considering the superconducting background , we may propose the following typical wave - function : @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the so - called paired boson superfluid wave function , which denotes the condensate of molecules formed by a pair of bosons.@xcite @xmath102 is the standard bcs wave - function . with such wave - function in hand , one may use the variational monte carlo technique to find the @xmath0 fractionalized bcs state in various lattice models .",
    "we note that the authors of ref .",
    "[ ] have studied the superfluid response of a @xmath0 fractionalized superconducting state ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "such @xmath8 state is formed by a bcs state of conduction electrons and a @xmath0 spin liquid of local electrons .",
    "this can be considered as a natural extension of the fractionalized fermi liquid.@xcite however , in our case we emphasize the pairing instability of orthogonal metals,@xcite which is rather different from the @xmath8 .      from the viewpoint of the weak coupling ,",
    "the superconducting state results from the pairing instability of certain parent normal ( metallic ) state and the usual bcs state indeed comes from the fermi liquid state .",
    "when it comes to the @xmath0 fractionalized bcs state , one may expect this mechanism still works and some unknown pairing glues lead to the superconducting instability of parent orthogonal metals .",
    "if this is true , we can write down the corresponding energy functional for the orthogonal metals like the usual landau fermi liquid , @xmath103 here , the energy of ising spins are not included and the only difference from the landau fermi liquid is that the `` quasiparticle '' @xmath104 represents the auxiliary fermion @xmath25 but not realistic electrons . the interaction effect between `` quasiparticles ''",
    "has been included in the function @xmath105 .",
    "then , one can add pairing interaction into it and some superconducting phases will be readily obtained .    however , if strong coupling is assumed ( e.g. rvb mechanism @xcite ) , particularly when system is approaching mott transition point , the energy functional eq.([eq12 ] ) is useless due to the dominate localization tendency .",
    "fortunately , following ref . [ ] and [ ] and using the hydrodynamical equation of eq.([eq12 ] ) and dual transformation , we can obtain actions similar to the ones encountered in gauge - theory description of high temperature superconductivity@xcite and kondo - breakdown mechanism@xcite for heavy - fermion compounds . in this way , the physical electrons are fractionalized to three parts : ising spin , fermionic spinon and bosonic chargon",
    ". then , based on the framework of rvb,@xcite the pairing of spinons and condensation of chargon will lead to the expected @xmath0 fractionalized bcs state .",
    "in summary , we have proposed an unconventional @xmath0 fractionalized bcs superconducting state .",
    "it has similar thermal and transport properties to the conventional bcs superconducting state , but its single - particle is strongly incoherent .",
    "such incoherence leads to the absence of the bcs coherent peak of the local density of state in this @xmath0 bcs state and this feature in principle could be probed by scanning tunneling microscopy or point - contact spectroscopy experiments .",

    "the prototypical wave - function of such @xmath0 bcs state is also proposed and it may be useful as trial wave - function in numerical simulations . the relations among @xmath0 bcs states , @xmath8 and parent orthogonal metals are also analyzed .",
