    "all spectra were obtained at the parallactic angle .",
    "the spectra were flux - calibrated using the blue spectrophotometric standards ( massey et al .",
    "repeat observations of one of our wd candidates over 4 nights showed that the wavelength dependent variations in the continuum shape are on the order of 6% for our typical wd spectra .",
    "hence , the relative flux levels at different wavelengths are reliable at the 6% level .",
    "the first step in our analysis is to smooth the observed spectra to a common resolving power in order to compare them with the same set of wd model atmospheres .",
    "we have chosen to smooth the spectra to @xmath13 2500 .",
    "this also increases slightly the signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath14 ) of the observed spectra .",

    "the spectra were normalized using two different procedures : @xmath16 determining the continuum by iteratively fitting a polynomial ( 6 iterations ) , then dividing by the fit , and @xmath17 dividing each spectrum by its median value .",
    "in the first case , the shape of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) is effectively removed , losing valuable information but avoiding systematic errors in the flux calibration and the effects of reddening .",

    "the grid of wd model atmospheres covers effective temperatures from 6,000 k to 30,000 k in steps of 1,000 k , and surface gravities from @xmath2 g = 5.0 to 9.0 in steps of 0.25 dex .",
    "the best - fit parameters are determined for each star by searching for the minimum @xmath18 in the range covered by the spectrum using the nelder - mead algorithm ( nelder & mead 1965 ) , performing quadratic bezier interpolation of the spectra in both @xmath19 and @xmath2 g ( allende prieto 2004 ) . in the case of full continuum normalization ( case @xmath20 )",
    ", we only fit the balmer line profiles , whereas we fit the entire spectrum in case @xmath21 .",
    "the derived error bars for the parameters are simply the square roots of the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix ( press et al .",
    "1986 ) .",
    "if the analysis is carried out at different resolving powers , the results change slightly for case @xmath20 where we fit the balmer lines .",
    "we have repeated our fits with @xmath22 changing from 2500 to 200 , and found that the drift can be approximately matched with a 1/@xmath22 law .",
    "we find that a reduction of resolving power from infinity to 2500 causes @xmath19 to be over - estimated by 1% and @xmath2 g by 0.04 dex .",
    "since our spectra are mostly composed of strong balmer lines , it is hard to determine the continuum in the blue part of the spectrum .",
    "in addition , the removal of the continuum sacrifices useful information and , in the presence of noise , introduces degeneracy  a decrease in @xmath19 can be compensated by an increase in @xmath2 g , and multiple minima are apparent , although one is usually significantly deeper than the other .    in case @xmath21 where we fit the entire spectrum , the parameters that we derive are independent of the resolution that we use down to @xmath23 200 ,",
    "therefore these results are more robust than those derived from the normalized spectra . in addition , the degeneracy problem is resolved with the additional information contained in the continuum shape . a comparison of our fits for cases @xmath20 and @xmath21 shows that on average our temperature and @xmath2 g estimates differ by @xmath7800 k and 0.07 dex , respectively .",

    "our fits to the original spectra contain more information than the continuum corrected spectra which help us resolve the @xmath19 and @xmath2 g degeneracy problem , and the solutions are independent of the spectral resolution used . our choice of spectral normalization ( case @xmath21 over case @xmath20 ) does not change our results significantly ( see figure 2 ) .",

    "thus , j0917 + 46 is the lowest gravity wd currently known .",
    "the discrepancy between the sdss photometry and our spectroscopic analysis initially puzzled us .",

    "what went wrong ?",
    "we begin by comparing the seds of our low mass candidates with the sdss broadband photometry .",

    "we have examined the seds of our candidates obtained from the sdss photometry , and compared them to our best fit solutions from spectroscopy .",
    "we have applied the following ab corrections to the observed sdss magnitudes : @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and no corrections in @xmath4 and @xmath28 ( see eisenstein et al .",
    "the sdss database gives the total interstellar absorption and reddening along the line of sight for each star , determined from the dust emission maps of schlegel et al .",
    "since all of our targets are at relatively high galactic latitudes , the total absorption and reddening are small ; the median total absorption @xmath29 is 0.11 , and the median total reddening @xmath30 is 0.05 .",
    "therefore , the errors in the reddening corrections have little effect on our analysis .",
    "we have calculated the predicted fluxes from our best fit model atmosphere by integrating over the sdss filter bandpasses . without knowing the radii and distances to the wds",
    ", we have used a @xmath18 minimization technique to match the predicted fluxes with the observed fluxes .",
    "the value of @xmath18 is taken as the sum over all bandpasses of the difference squared between the predicted and observed fluxes , properly weighted by the corresponding observational uncertainties .",
    "figure 6 shows the seds of four of the objects observed at the mmt plus the lowest mass wd candidate identified by eisenstein et al .",
    "the de - reddened sdss photometry and the fluxes predicted for the parameters derived from our spectroscopic analysis are shown as error bars and circles , respectively .",
    "a comparison of the photometry and our best fit solutions shows that the sdss @xmath4-band photometry is systematically discrepant .",
    "for example , our best fit solution for j0745 + 18 and j1529 + 33 ( top two panels ) reproduce @xmath31 , and @xmath32 photometry reasonably well .",
    "however , the sdss @xmath4 magnitudes are 20 - 30% brighter than expected for these two objects ( as well as many other candidates in the mmt sample ) . in order to check",
    "if the discrepancy is caused by our small reddening correction , we have also compared the predicted fluxes to the observed ( not - dereddened ) sdss photometry , and found the same discrepancy in the @xmath4-band .",
    "brighter @xmath4-band magnitudes cause the objects to have more positive @xmath10 colors and more negative @xmath11 colors that are consistent with low mass wds .",
    "this suggests that sdss photometry can not be used by itself to identify elm wds .",
    "we note that the @xmath4-band magnitude for the previous lowest mass wd candidate , j2049 + 00 ( eisenstein et al .",
    "2006 ) , may also be suspect .",
    "the bottom panel of figure 6 shows that the sed of j2049 + 00 is discrepant with its @xmath4-band magnitude , and thus we revisit its identification as an elm wd .",
    "we now bring together the low mass wd candidates previously found in sdss .",

    "1987 ; rappaport et al .",
    "they also argued that if the initial orbital period of the system is between 0.95 and @xmath71.50 days ( the upper limit is the bifurcation orbital period ) , the systems would evolve towards shorter orbital periods and lmxbs with orbital periods of @xmath55 10 hours will be formed .",
    "ergma et al .",
    "( 1998 ) found that the lowest mass wds in such systems would be 0.15 - 0.16 @xmath3 and 0.17@xmath3 for population i and ii stars , respectively .",
    "these low mass limits also seem consistent with the analysis of benvenuto & de vito ( 2005 ) .    binary millisecond pulsar systems with low mass wd secondaries",
    "are thought to be the descendants of the lmxbs .",
    "all of the currently known wds in the field and around the millisecond pulsars have masses larger than 0.17 @xmath3 .",
    "the masses of some of these wds have been determined from the shapiro ( 1964 ) delay of the pulsar signal in the gravitational field of the companion wd ( lhmer et al . 2005 ) .",
    "this delay is linearly proportional to the mass of the companion , and therefore the non - detection of @xmath56 0.17 @xmath3 wds around pulsars may be an observational bias . a more targeted search for these objects may find wds with smaller masses , however identifying these low gravity objects as low mass wds may be challenging . on the other hand ,",
    "if the binary formation models of low mass he - core wds around neutron stars are correct , we would expect to find lower mass wds only in ultra - compact lmxbs and their descendants .",
    "we have performed spectroscopic analysis of the low mass wd candidates found in the sdss .",
    "we have shown that sdss j0917 + 46 is the lowest mass wd currently known with @xmath59 .",
    "in addition , there are three more wds in the sdss with masses smaller than 0.2 @xmath3 .",
    "these wds presumably have unseen companions . a radial velocity search for",
    "these unseen companions will be necessary to constrain their masses and the evolutionary scenarios for the formation of extremely low mass wds .",
    "so far both of the spectroscopically confirmed @xmath70.2 @xmath3 wds with known companions ( psr j1012 + 5307 and j1911 - 5958a ) are in 14.5 - 20 hour orbits around neutron star companions ( van kerkwijk et al .",
    "1996 ; bassa et al .",

    "however , their sample included only one wd with @xmath60 ( sdss j1234 - 02 ) .",
    "liebert et al .",
    "( 2004 ) argued that if the binary separation is appropriate , it is possible to create an extremely low mass wd in a wd - wd binary as well .",
    "time - resolved radial velocity measurements will be necessary to differentiate between these two formation scenarios . excluding the ultra - short period lmxbs , the models for the formation of low mass helium wds in millisecond pulsar binary systems predict the lowest mass wds to have @xmath61 .",
