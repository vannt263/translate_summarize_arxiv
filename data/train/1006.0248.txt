    "we write down the simplest solution which interpolates between self - dual and anti - self - dual abelian homogeneous fields and consider the spectrum of covariant derivative squared @xmath4 in the presence of this kink background field .",
    "the kink configuration is seen here as a domain wall separating the regions with almost self - dual and anti - self - dual abelian gauge field .",
    "it should be stressed that consideration itself and the results of this paper can be seen as instructive but very preliminary ones .",
