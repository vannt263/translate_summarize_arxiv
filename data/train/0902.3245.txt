    "populations of lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) have now been identified up to @xmath12 , when the universe was less than 1 gyr old .",
    "observations now point to earlier times as an important period in the evolution of galaxies .",
    "first , some galaxies at @xmath12 have well established stellar populations , with ages @xmath15 myrs and masses @xmath16 m@xmath17 ( @xcite , 2007 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , requiring significant star formation at @xmath5 .",
    "second , these `` first galaxies '' likely played an essential role in the reionization of the intergalactic medium , which occurred sometime between @xmath6 and 14 ( from the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ , wmap ; @xcite ) .",
    "observations of these @xmath18 galaxies are crucial ; however , the search has been significantly more difficult than surveys for lbgs at @xmath19 . at @xmath20 ,",
    "the lyman break passes into the @xmath21-band , and galaxies must be identified with near - infrared imaging , where sensitivity and area are limited . to make matters more challenging , evolution of the uv luminosity function shows declining numbers of luminous lbgs with increasing redshift , over the period of @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "regardless of whether this trend continues to @xmath6 , the low density of luminous lbgs at @xmath12 ( a few hundred degree@xmath22 to @xmath23  = 26 ) means that both wide area and sensitivity are necessary to continue the search to @xmath5 .",
    "progress in this search for high@xmath24 lbgs has been made on three fronts .",
    "first , wide - area surveys have probed the bright end of the luminosity function ( lf ) .",
    "@xcite used the vlt / isaac nir data in goods south to search 130 arcmin@xmath2 to @xmath25 , and @xcite searched eleven independent sight lines covering 360 arcmin@xmath26 to @xmath27 .",
    "both teams find only a few marginal candidates which they interpret as probable interlopers .",
    "their limits are roughly consistent with extrapolation of the @xmath12 lf , although @xcite report a slight decline to @xmath6 . at higher redshifts",
    ", we have searched 135 arcmin@xmath2 of deep @xmath4  and @xmath28   parallel images for galaxies at @xmath29 , uncovering one @xmath8 candidate ( jd2325 + 1433 ; @xcite ) .",
    "a second approach has been to use strong gravitational lensing to probe the fainter luminosities , where the volume density of @xmath5 galaxies should be higher .",
    "several candidates have been found by this technique ( @xcite ; @xcite , 2008 ) .",
    "however , in an independent analysis of the @xcite data , @xcite suggest that most of these galaxies are either spurious detections , or they fail to meet the @xmath5 selection criteria . this disagreement is indicative of the challenge posed by the search for these extremely faint galaxies . to make progress ,",
    "very deep observations are needed in both the optical and near - infrared .",
    "this challenge is mitigated by the use of deep nicmos imaging in goods , including the ultra deep field ( udf ) , the hubble deep field north ( hdfn ) , and various parallel exposures ( @xcite ; 2005 , 2008 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "although only eight candidates are found in these @xmath30 arcmin@xmath2 , and none are spectroscopically confirmed , @xcite report a luminosity function with a bright end that continues to evolve in the same manner as those at @xmath19 .",
    "while uncertain , these data suggest that the density of the most luminous @xmath6 galaxies is even smaller than at @xmath12 .",
    "because only eight of these galaxies have been found , expanding the most sensitive combined infrared and optical coverage to identify even one additional @xmath31dropout lbg would be a significant contribution .",
    "accordingly , we have obtained @xmath32 arcmin@xmath2 of coordinated nicmos parallel observations in @xmath4  and @xmath28 , taken in the goods fields ( @xcite ) , cosmos ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and ssa22 @xcite . the goods and cosmos images reach 5 @xmath3 = 26.0 - 26.7 in @xmath4  ( 06 diameter aperture) 1 - 2 magnitudes deeper than the wide area ground based searches carried out by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the two parallel fields in ssa22 are significantly deeper , reaching 5 @xmath33 and 27.0 in @xmath4 .",
    "although most of this area is less sensitive than the udf and hdfn , four out of eight @xmath6 candidates in bouwens et al .",
    "( 2008 ; @xmath30 arcmin@xmath2 ) are bright enough to be detected in the deepest of these new goods and cosmos images , and most are bright enough to be detected in the ssa22 fields .",
    "in addition to this search , we have carried out deep follow - up optical imaging of jd2325 + 1433 , the @xmath8 candidate presented in @xcite .    in  [ data ] we describe the data reduction and photometry , as well as an overview of the public data products that we use . in ",
    "[ selection ] we describe the selection of @xmath5 candidates and the criteria which we use to discriminate against interlopers . in  [ discussion ] we derive a new upper limit on the volume density of @xmath20 galaxies , and discuss implications for the reionization of hydrogen in the intergalactic medium . finally , in  [ jd2_followup ]",
    "we present new observations of the @xmath8 candidate mentioned above , which suggest that it is an intermediate redshift interloper .",
    "we use @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and ab magnitudes throughout .",
    "the data used here consist of nicmos parallel observations taken during go programs 10872 in goods and 11236 in cosmos ( pi h. teplitz ) , and 11188 in ssa22 ( pi b. siana ) .",
    "for the goods fields , 15 parallel fields were observed in @xmath4  and @xmath28 , and nine lie within the goods footprint where acs data are available .",
    "the positions of these fields within goods are shown in figure [ goods_footprint ] and coordinates are listed in table [ obstable ] . in total , this corresponds to 5.9 square arcminutes of new nicmos imaging in goods .",
    "we note that three fields ( cdfs-1,-2 , and -3 ) are also included in the @xcite search , where they are found not to contain any @xmath5 candidates .",
    "however , in light of the large discrepancy seen in the same nicmos data by @xcite and @xcite , we include these fields in our search as a consistency check .",
    "typical exposures for these nicmos parallels in goods were 8 ks in @xmath4  and 5 ks in @xmath28 .",
    "the cosmos parallels consist of twelve fields observed in @xmath4  and @xmath28 , eleven of which lie within the subaru / suprimecam images in @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath13 , and @xmath39 .",
    "seven of these eleven fields are also within the acs @xmath40  footprint .",
    "a twelfth parallel field lies in the north - east corner of cosmos , where the limited suprimecam coverage is not sensitive enough to discriminate between @xmath5 galaxies and interlopers with typical galaxy colors .",
    "therefore , we exclude this field from our survey . for the remaining eleven cosmos fields , although the optical imaging is not as deep as in goods , it is adequate to remove interlopers , because , as we will show in   3.1 ,",
    "no @xmath5 candidates are found in the cosmos fields . in total",
    "these eleven nicmos parallel fields cover 7.2 arcmin@xmath2 .",
    "their locations are shown in figure [ cosmos_footprint ] and coordinates are listed in table [ obstable ] .",
    "typical exposures were 6 - 8 ks , divided between @xmath4  and @xmath28 .",
    "lastly , we include two parallel fields in ssa22 , which comprise some of the deepest available nicmos imaging . however , at these faint limits , optical data in ssa22 that are deep enough to be useful are limited .",
    "ground - based optical images are not sensitive enough to detect the faintest sources in the nicmos images , even if they have typical galaxy seds .",
    "the only available observation that can adequately rule out interlopers is an acs @xmath40  image ( go 10405 , pi s. chapman ) , which covers only ssa22 - 2 . because all nicmos sources are detected in this @xmath40  image , we know that no candidates are found in this parallel field ( see  [ selection ] ) without considering @xmath21-band data , so we can include it in our survey volume .",
    "although ssa22 - 1 can not be used in the @xmath6 search , we are able to use both fields for the @xmath4-dropout lbg search , because there are no sources that are red enough in @xmath4  - @xmath28   to meet the @xmath8 selection criterion in either ssa22 parallel field .    with these data ,",
    "we select @xmath5 candidates as @xmath31dropouts and @xmath4-dropouts , using the deep optical images to reject interlopers .",
    "this will be discussed in detail in  [ selection ] .",
    "the nicmos images were reduced and combined with a combination of custom idl and python scripts and available iraf procedures .",
    "first , images were pedestal - corrected , and the south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) darks were subtracted for impacted orbits . following the saa correction , the pedestal correction was repeated to improve the subtraction .",
    "next , the sky frames were made and subtracted using mcleod s nicred ( 1997 ) code , and a static bad pixel mask which included the vignetted rows was created from these sky frames . to remove any remaining gradients in the images",
    ", we made sky images with each column replaced by its median .",
    "this image was smoothed by a three - pixel wide boxcar and subtracted from each nicmos frame",
    ". then this process was repeated for each row of pixels to remove top - to - bottom gradients . next",
    ", intermittent bad pixels were identified in each image using the iraf package crutil .",
    "these masks were combined with the static bad pixel mask , and finally frames were drizzled @xcite , using the parameters recommended in the dither handbook ( pixfrac = 0.6 , and scale = 0.5 ) .",
    "shifts were derived so that the final @xmath4   and @xmath28  images are drizzled onto the same frame and are therefore aligned .",
    "the resulting pixels are 01 , and the zero points that we use are adjusted by -0.16 and -0.04 magnitudes in @xmath4  and @xmath28 , to correct for the non - linearity reported by @xcite .",
    "sensitivities were measured by randomly placing 06 diameter apertures in the images , rejecting apertures which contained light from objects .",
    "this procedure is repeated for each nicmos image , as exposure times varied .",
    "the 5@xmath3 limits are 26.0 - 27.5 in @xmath4  and 25.9 - 27.0 in @xmath28 , with the faintest limits reached in the small area in ssa22 ( see table [ obstable ] ) .",
    "the point - spread - function ( psf ) for these nicmos images was derived by stacking several isolated , unsaturated stars .",
    "the resulting psf has a fwhm @xmath1 03 in both bands .",
    "the point source aperture correction for a 06 diameter aperture is 0.31 magnitudes .",
    "[ [ goods ] ] goods + + + + +    we use the publicly available v2.0 acs goods images in @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath23   bands . included in v2.0 is additional data used to search for type ia supernovae , which doubles the v1.0 exposure time in the @xmath23  band , and also increases the sensitivity in @xmath43 .",
    "this significantly enhances the sensitivity to galaxies at @xmath44 , and improves identification of faint interlopers .",
    "as with the nicmos images , a psf is determined by stacking several point sources found in the acs images .",
    "we find a fwhm of @xmath1 01 in @xmath23 .",
    "typical 3@xmath3 limits are 28.7 , 28.8 , 28.3 , in @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , measured in 04 diameter apertures . as we will describe in  [ phot ] ,  @xmath23  magnitudes are measured from 06 diameter apertures in images matched to the nicmos resolution . for these",
    ", the 3@xmath3 sensitivity is @xmath45 magnitudes .",
    "some parallel fields near the edge of the goods footprint have reduced sensitivity .",
    "we carefully measure the sensitivity in each of the fields , as our objective is to determine whether each source is detected in @xmath41 , @xmath42 , or @xmath43 .",
    "[ [ cosmos ] ] cosmos + + + + + +    the cosmos data that we use are less homogenous than the goods data , consisting of both subaru / suprimecam images at @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath13 , and @xmath39 , and where available , acs @xmath40  images .",

[ [ ssa22 ] ] ssa22",
    "+ + + + +    as described above , the only optical imaging that we use for the ssa22 parallels is an acs @xmath40  image that covers ssa22 - 2 .",
    "we use the `` drz '' image , directly from the archive , which has a 3@xmath3 sensitivity of 28.3 in a 04 diameter aperture .      to select @xmath5 galaxies , we compare",
    "the above described @xmath39or @xmath23  data to nicmos images .",

    "we describe these approaches below .",
    "[ [ goods-1 ] ] goods + + + + +    to measure accurate colors of all the galaxies in the nine nicmos fields in goods , we downgraded the resolution of the acs @xmath23  images by matching the nicmos psf . to achieve this",
    ", we use the iraf task psfmatch , which convolves the acs images with a kernel made from the nicmos and acs psfs .",
    "the convolved acs images are then rebinned and aligned with the nicmos images .",
    "then , we use sextractor @xcite in dual - image mode , with an inverse - variance weighted average @xmath4  + @xmath28  image as the detection image . for detection ,",
    "we require five contiguous pixels 1.3 @xmath3 above the background .",
    "in addition , we use the gauss_3.0_5x5.conv filter , which is optimized for finding faint sources .",
    "lastly , spurious detections , artifacts , and electronic ghosts are manually removed from the catalog .",
    "the @xmath23  - @xmath4   and @xmath4  - @xmath28  colors are measured in 06 diameter apertures , and the two - color plot is shown in figure [ ccp ] ( left ) .    in order to test for non - detections at bands shorter than @xmath23",
    ", we measure the flux in 04 apertures in the original , unconvolved @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43  images , at the positions predicted by our nicmos detections .",
    "[ [ cosmos-1 ] ] cosmos + + + + + +    the cosmos data require a different approach , because downgrading the resolution of the nicmos images to 12 seeing causes a significant loss of sensitivity .",
    "instead , we resample the @xmath39  images to 01 per pixel ( the same as nicmos ) , and align them to match nicmos .",
    "we then used sextractor in the same manner as with goods , except we use 06 diameter apertures in @xmath4  and @xmath28 , and 12 in @xmath39 .",
    "the aperture corrections for point sources in these apertures are 0.31 magnitudes for nicmos and 0.74 magnitudes for cosmos .",
    "because galaxies at @xmath18 should be compact in nicmos images ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , this treatment is appropriate for the sources that we are interested in . for extended sources ,",
    "we expect blue - ward scatter in @xmath39  - @xmath4  ( away from the @xmath5 selection ) , as more light will be missed from the higher resolution data .",
    "this trend is confirmed for simulated galaxies , using the iraf artdata package . the two - color plot for the cosmos fields",
    "is shown in figure [ ccp ] ( right ) .",
    "as with the goods data , we measure the flux at the positions predicted by the nicmos detections , using 08 apertures in b , @xmath38 and @xmath13 , and 04 apertures in @xmath40 .    [ [ ssa22 - 1 ] ] ssa22 + + + + +    as we are not using any @xmath31 band data for ssa22 , there is no need to properly account for @xmath31 @xmath4  colors measured with mismatched apertures and resolutions .",
    "therefore , we simply follow the same procedures described above for the goods and cosmos parallels measuring @xmath4  and @xmath28  with sextractor , and testing for @xmath40  detections in 04 diameters apertures in ssa22 - 2 where the acs data are available .",
    "candidates for @xmath5 galaxies are selected using the following criteria : first , we require that galaxies are detected in the @xmath4  + @xmath28  detection image at @xmath46 significance . in total , we find 696 sources that meet this criterion in goods , 701 in cosmos , and 211 in ssa22 .",
    "next , @xmath5 candidates must be undetected at the 2 @xmath3 level in bands bluer than @xmath39  or @xmath23 .",
    "this eliminates the vast majority of sources , with only two candidates remaining in the goods fields , two in cosmos , and none in ssa22 - 2 .",
    "we list these sources in table [ dropouts ] , and we will proceed to show that all are interlopers .",
    "we next use the colors of these sources to determine if any have seds consistent with @xmath6 galaxies .",
    "we adopt the color cutof bouwens et al .",
    "( 2008 , 2009 ) , so that candidates must have @xmath21 - @xmath4  > 0.8 and @xmath21 - @xmath4   @xmath47 ( @xmath4- @xmath28 ) , and @xmath4   -@xmath28  @xmath48 ( where @xmath21 refers to both @xmath23  and @xmath39 ) .",
    "all four of the `` dropout '' sources mentioned above lie outside this selection .",

    "while @xcite have suggested a stricter cut of @xmath23- @xmath4@xmath50 , adopting this cut would make no difference in our search , because we have not found any candidates with the most generous selection .",
    "the red @xmath4  - @xmath28   colors of these three sources could be an indication of the lyman break in the @xmath4 band , and redshifts @xmath51 ( @xcite ; @xcite , 2008 ) .",
    "however , @xmath4  - dropouts must also be undetected at the 2@xmath3 level in the @xmath39  or @xmath23  bands .",
    "this restriction eliminates cdfs3-jd1 and cdfs4-jd1 . the remaining source , c8-jd1 ,",
    "can not be ruled out on the basis of optical / nir data alone , but longer wavelength data from irac on the _ spitzer space telescope _ show strong detections at 3.6 and 4.5  ( @xmath28  - [ 3.6 ] = 2.4 , @xmath28  - [ 4.5 ] = 2.7 ) . for @xmath8 ,",
    "these colors correspond to a rest - frame uv slope which is much redder than lyman break galaxies , so this galaxy is more likely an interloper at @xmath52 with a dusty starburst or an old stellar population . in conclusion ,",
    "none of the four optical `` dropout '' sources that we find can be described as a plausible @xmath5 galaxy .",
    "we have rejected as interlopers any sources which have 2@xmath3 detections in @xmath41 , @xmath37 , @xmath42 , @xmath38 , @xmath13 or @xmath40 .",
    "while this approach is commonly taken in lbg surveys , it does not consider the possibility that a weak detection in any or all of these `` veto '' bands could arise from foreground contamination .",
    "in fact , as we will demonstrate , the probability of contamination is significant .    to estimate the influence of foreground contamination , we use the udf acs catalogs .",
    "the surface density of sources brighter than our typical 2@xmath3 detection limits in goods ( @xmath41 , @xmath42  and @xmath43@xmath1 29.1 , 29.2 , and 28.7 ) is @xmath1 400 arcmin@xmath22 .",
    "this corresponds to about a 10% probability of a foreground contaminant lying within 05 of a nicmos detected source . for the cosmos fields , the @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath13  limits are shallower , so the surface density of possible contaminants is lower ( @xmath1 250 arcmin@xmath22 )",
    "however , the seeing - limited resolution requires larger apertures . in this case",
    ", we find that the probability of a foreground source lying within 1  of a @xmath5 candidate is about 20% .",
    "we therefore estimate that 10 - 20 % of true @xmath5 galaxies would be rejected by our survey because of faint foreground contaminants .",
    "while we have not detected any candidate @xmath5 galaxies , we can place limits on the luminosity functions ( lfs ) of @xmath31 dropouts at @xmath6 , and @xmath4  -dropouts at @xmath8 .",
    "furthermore , we can compare this limit to predictions from lfs at @xmath19 and place constraints on evolution from @xmath12 to 7 .",
    "first , we calculate the survey volume following @xcite : @xmath53 the quantity @xmath54 is the probability of both detecting a source of a given absolute magnitude and redshift , and selecting it as a @xmath31 or @xmath4- dropout based on the criteria that we established in  [ selection ] .",
    "this probability can be expressed as @xmath55 , with @xmath56 representing the selection function , and @xmath57 the photometric completeness .",
    "we use simulations to determine these quantities for both @xmath6 and @xmath8 . to obtain @xmath56",
    ", we require only one assumption , namely , a distribution of galaxy spectra .",
    "we use a gaussian distribution of uv power - law slopes estimated from @xmath12 galaxies ( @xmath58 ; @xmath59 ; stanway et al . 2005 ) .",
    "then , for every m , @xmath21 , and @xmath60 , we predict the @xmath39 , @xmath23 , @xmath4  and @xmath28 band magnitudes , as well as the the magnitude in the @xmath4  + @xmath28  image that we used for detection .",
    "sources are required to be ( 1 ) bright enough to be detected at @xmath61 significance in the @xmath4  + @xmath28   image , and ( 2 ) meet the color selection criteria discussed in  [ selection ] .",
    "we also assume that 15% of all @xmath5 galaxies are missed because of foreground contamination , as we showed in  [ foreground_contam ] .",
    "we calculate @xmath56 for both the @xmath39  ( cosmos ) and @xmath23  ( goods ) filter sets , and find that the difference is less than 2% ( for a fixed @xmath4  + @xmath28  apparent magnitude limit ) .",
    "therefore , the only difference in the goods and cosmos portions of this survey is that the nicmos images in cosmos are slightly shallower .",
    "we measure the photometric completeness , @xmath57 , using the iraf package , artdata , to add point sources to the @xmath4  + @xmath28   images .",
    "we then use sextractor with the same configuration that we used for the photometry described in ",
    "we find a typical completeness of 70 - 80% at the 5@xmath3 detection threshold for the aggressive sextractor parameters that we have chosen . finally ,",
    "to evaluate equation ( 1 ) , we assume that all of the @xmath31dropouts are at @xmath62 , and the @xmath4-dropouts are at @xmath63 , so that @xmath57 translates to @xmath64 .",
    "the resulting effective survey volumes for @xmath6 and @xmath8 are shown in figure [ veff_fig ] . as mentioned in ",
    "[ data ] , due to limited optical data , we can only include ssa22 - 2 in the @xmath6 search , but both ssa22 fields are included in the @xmath8 upper limit , as they contain no candidates with @xmath4- @xmath28  @xmath65 .",

    "it is important to note that this conversion assumes no extinction , solar metallicity , and a salpeter imf with @xmath80 from @xmath81 . while a correction to a more likely metallicity of @xmath82 is negligible ( @xmath83 % ) , a shallower imf slope of -1.7 will decrease the sfr by a factor of 3.2 ( calculated from starburst99 ; @xcite ) .",
    "an important question remains whether galaxies at @xmath84 are capable of reionizing the neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium .",
    "this question is difficult to address , as it depends on the duration of the reionization .",
    "a longer reionization will require more ionizing photons over the lifetime of the galaxies in order to account for recombination @xcite . nonetheless , it is interesting to compare our upper limit to the recombination rate at @xmath6 , for a completely ionized igm ( consistent with the wmap 5 year electron scattering optical depth ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite report this rate in terms of the critical sfr required to maintain an ionized igm :    @xmath85    where , again , solar metallicity and a salpeter imf from 0.1 - 100 @xmath86 are assumed .",
    "this critical sfr also depends on a number of other important , but uncertain parameters .",
    "the escape fraction of ionizing photons , @xmath87 , has been difficult to measure . while a number of authors have found that the escape fraction is small ( @xmath88 5 - 10% relative to photons escaping at 1500 ; @xcite ; @xcite , bridge et al .",
    ", in prep ) , there remains some evidence that it could increase with redshift ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the hii clumping factor , @xmath89 , is also important , as this dictates the average recombination rate per hydrogen atom relative to an igm of uniform density .",
    "while many authors have adopted an estimate of @xmath90 , based on simulations by @xcite , more recent work suggests that this estimate is much too high , and @xmath91 may be more appropriate ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in order to meet the requirement posed by our upper limit of 0.019 @xmath92 at @xmath6 , we find that @xmath93 .",
    "however , this number is strongly influenced by the faint end slope of the lf , because we have integrated our constraints to zero luminosity .",
    "we have assumed a faint end slope of @xmath77 , based on @xcite , but @xcite show that this slope is influenced by input assumptions such as dust extinction and igm neutral hydrogen absorption ( which alter the effective survey volume ) .",
    "for the shallower slope of @xmath94 , reported by oesch et al .",
    ", our upper limit is reduced by a factor of 1.7 , and we then require @xmath95 . on the other hand , it has been predicted that @xmath96 approaches 2 for a sample of young galaxies undergoing their first significant bursts of star formation @xcite . in this case , constraints are more dependent on the true low luminosity cutoff .",
    "the effects of metallicity and imf are also important in determining the ionizing output of galaxies .",
    "we use starburst99 models @xcite to calculate the ionizing photon rate for metal poor stellar populations ( @xmath97 ) and for a shallower imf slope . for a salpeter imf and @xmath98",
    ", a stellar population will produce 1.4 times more ionizing photons than a solar metallicity population with the same uv luminosity .",
    "consequently , the constraint from this survey becomes @xmath99 .",
    "likewise , with @xmath98 and a shallower imf slope of @xmath100 , this constraint is relaxed to @xmath101 .",
    "lastly , it has also been noted that the electron temperature in the primordial hii regions will play an imortant role ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "because the recombination coefficient is proportional to @xmath102 , a factor of two increase in temperature decreases the critical star formation rate by a factor of @xmath103 .    in summary , we find that for reasonable models , @xmath104 is required to maintain an ionized igm at @xmath6 .",
    "this echos constraints reported by @xcite , who finds that for @xmath105 ( `` high - v '' case ) and a salpeter imf the number of ionizing photons produced is too low to reionize hydrogen , unless the reionization occurred rapidly between @xmath106 .",
    "[ jd2_followup ] in @xcite we reported the discovery of a luminous @xmath8 candidate from the wide area , nicmos pure parallel survey ( 135 arcmin@xmath2 to @xmath4  and @xmath28  @xmath107 ab ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this candidate , jd2325 + 1433 , was identified as having a strong spectral break between the @xmath4  and @xmath28  bands , with a faint but detected @xmath4  flux and @xmath4  - @xmath28  = 1.7 .",
    "subsequent followup observations with _",
    "spitzer_/irac showed a flat spectrum in @xmath28  - [ 3.6 ] , and a second spectral break between 3.6  and 4.5 .",
    "the only possibility for two breaks are the lyman and balmer breaks , and a redshift of @xmath8",
    ". however , given the uncertainties in irac flux , the significance of the second break is only about 95% , and without this break , the galaxy spectrum could also be fit by an intermediate - redshift elliptical or post - starburst galaxy .    the main impediment to a robust identification of jd2325 + 1433  as a @xmath8 galaxy is the lack of deep optical imaging to verify that we have indeed identified the lyman break .",
    "such observations require a significant investment , and a non - detection at @xmath108 ab would ultimately not be definitive because interlopers could be even fainter than this .",
    "on the other hand , obtaining a detection would definitively rule out the @xmath8 interpretation .",
    "therefore , we have obtained @xmath13  observations with the mmt to attempt to understand the nature of jd2325 + 1433 .",
    "the @xmath13   observations consisted of a series of exposures , of length 300 to 500s each ( @xmath109 hours ) , taken on the nights of 2008 june 19 - 24 with megacam at the 6.5 m mmt ( mcleod et al .",
    "the observations were carried out through thin cirrus , except for the nights of 2008 june 20 and 21 , which were photometric .",
    "seeing varied from as low as 08 to as high as 16 , and averaged about 10 .",
    "the data were reduced interactively using standard techniques : bias - subtracted and flattened exposures were treated to remove cosmic rays and bad pixels before calculating the coordinates using stars from the usnob1.0 catalog and correcting the photometry for off - axis scattered light .",
    "the resulting exposures were spatially registered to a common coordinate system .",
    "all frames taken on the nights of 2008 june 19 , and 22 - 24 were then flux - calibrated using exposures from the photometric nights , and all the frames were then coadded to create an @xmath13  mosaic .",
    "the final image has a seeing fwhm of 12 .",
    "we show a cutout image centered on jd2325 + 1433  in figure [ stampfig ] , alongside our nicmos and irac images that are described in @xcite .",
    "we use the nicmos images to predict the position of jd2325 + 1433  in the @xmath13  image , and measure the flux in a 13 diameter aperture at this position .",
    "the noise is measured by randomly placing apertures in blank parts of the image , as was done with the nicmos and other optical images ( see  [ data ] ) .",
    "we find a s / n of 2.6 , and an aperture magnitude of @xmath110 .",
    "the aperture correction measured for point sources in the field is @xmath111 in flux units , and so the result is @xmath13= @xmath112 , total .",
    "although the detection is weak , it strongly suggests an intermediate redshift interloper .",
    "the probability of the @xmath13  detection being the result of a foreground contaminant ( as we described in  [ foreground_contam ] ) within 1  of jd2325 + 1433  is low ( @xmath1 5% ) , as the @xmath13  image is not as deep as the goods and cosmos optical images .",
    "we update the photometric redshift of jd2325 + 1433  by including the @xmath13  measurement , and repeating the fit that we performed in @xcite .",
    "to do this , we use the photometric redshift code ,   _ hyperz _",
    "@xcite , with @xcite stellar synthesis templates .",
    "we fit for redshift , allowing age , extinction ( using calzetti et al .",
    "2000 ) , and metallicity to be free ( @xmath113 ) , and using four star formation histories : an instantaneous burst , a constant sfr , and two exponentially declining star formation histories with e - folding times ( @xmath114 ) of 100 and 500 myrs . as in @xcite",
    ", we do not include the upper limits at 5.8 and 8.0 , as they do not constrain the fit .",
    "the revised , best - fitting model is shown in figure [ newsedfig ] .",
    "it is described by a 250 myr instantaneous burst at @xmath14 , with solar metallicity , @xmath115 , and a stellar mass of @xmath116 .",
    "the absolute b - band magnitude is @xmath117 .",
    "we use monte carlo simulations to assess this underconstrained problem by constructing a five dimensional ( @xmath21 , age , @xmath118 , metallicity , and star formation history ) probability density function .",
    "this is done by generating @xmath119 realizations of the photometry , with magnitudes simultaneously perturbed according to the uncertainties .",
    "we then repeat the fit described above . the probability distribution in redshift space",
    "is shown in figure [ newsedfig ] .",
    "now , @xmath120 solutions are favored , with 74% of realizations having a best fit at @xmath121 .",
    "the fact that the @xmath29 interpretation still comprises a significant fraction of the simulated fits is guaranteed by the low s / n @xmath13  detection , which frequently dips below 1@xmath3 when perturbed in the monte carlo simulation .",
    "for these cases we do not include the @xmath13  observations and the fits strongly favor the @xmath8 solution .",
    "regardless , the inclusion of this weak detection in our analysis adjusts the preferred redshift to @xmath120 .",
    "this is more in line with an extrapolation of the bouwens et al .",
    "( 2006 , 2007 ) luminosity functions , which imply a low likelihood of a galaxy at @xmath8 .",
    "the additional constraints from our monte carlo simulation suggest , for @xmath121 : ( 1 ) a poorly constrained age with a median of 360 myrs , and a 68% confidence interval ranging from 100 myrs to 1 gyr and ( 2 ) little or no extinction , with 68% of realizations preferring @xmath118 of 0.5 or less .",
    "the discovery that jd2325 + 1433  is an interloper has important implications for future @xmath8 surveys , because similar sources will be readily discovered with new near - infrared instruments .",
    "in addition to jd2325 + 1433 in the nicmos pure parallel survey we find 12 more galaxies down to @xmath28  @xmath122 which have similarly red @xmath4  - @xmath28@xmath123 .",
    "as this wide area survey is complete for such red galaxies at this limit , the density of these objects is approximately 200 degree@xmath22 .",
    "longer wavelength irac observations of a few of these sources indicate rising seds that are indicative of interlopers , but not all of these unusually red galaxies have yet been observed with irac .",
    "so it is likely that more galaxies with extremely red @xmath4  - @xmath28  and a flat spectrum at longer wavelengths have been detected in the nicmos pure parallel imaging .",
    "these sources will be difficult , if not impossible to distinguish from @xmath124 galaxies in future surveys , meaning that deep optical imaging or a high s / n detection of the balmer break will be crucial .    using deep optical imaging to distinguish @xmath124 galaxies from interlopers will be challenging . at the faint magnitudes where these galaxies are more likely to be confirmed ( @xmath125 ab ) , optical observations with the _ james webb space telescope _ will take at least 10 hours per pointing to reach @xmath126 ab at the 2 @xmath3 level required for non - detection . in total , this investment in telescope time simply to confirm non - detections could amount to hundreds of hours .",
    "in addition , as we showed in",
    " [ foreground_contam ] , foreground contamination from faint , lower - redshift objects can be a substantial source of incompleteness . extrapolating number counts from the udf",
    ", we estimate the surface density of galaxies brighter than @xmath127 ab ( total magnitudes ) in @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43  is @xmath128 arcmin@xmath22 , or 0.25 arcsec@xmath22 .",
    "clearly , high angular resolution will be necessary to distinguish interlopers from @xmath51 galaxies , as ground - based seeing limited observations would suffer from severe confusion .",
    "the absence of any @xmath5 galaxies in our new nicmos data strongly constrains the volume density of @xmath5 galaxies .",
    "we have shown that at @xmath6 , if @xmath9 , then @xmath129 , and the cosmic star formation density ( integrated to zero luminosity ) is @xmath130 .",
    "although the luminosities that we observe are much brighter than the candidates reported from lensing surveys ( richard et al .",
    "2006 , 2008 ) , we can indirectly address their discrepancy with the field survey of @xcite .",
    "our non - detection is consistent with bouwens et al .",
    ", so our independent result supports their reported evolution for the most luminous sources .",
    "this suggests an additional fading of @xmath131 by 0.4 magnitudes at from @xmath12 to @xmath6 .",
    "clearly , large uncertainties remain as the few reported candidates are hardly robust detections .",
    "upcoming surveys using the wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) on board hst will address this issue with its improved resolution and sensitivity , increasing the number of known @xmath6 candidates by an order of magnitude .",
    "current plans to use pure parallel mode observations to cover a wide area ( pis m. trenti , h. yan , and m. malkan ) will also provide crucial measurements of the luminous sources .",
    "interpretation of the uv luminosity function in terms of the ionizing photon budget required for neutral hydrogen reionization is uncertain , for reasons that we ( in  [ discussion ] ) and many others ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) have discussed .",
    "however , for a salpeter imf and a faint end slope of @xmath77 ( reported at @xmath12 by @xcite ) , we find @xmath132 is required to maintain a completely ionized igm at @xmath6 . for current estimate of @xmath133",
    "( @xcite ; @xcite ) and the commonly adopted @xmath134 ( e.g. @xcite ) , this ratio is @xmath135 far too high for star forming galaxies to maintain a completely ionized igm at @xmath6 .",
    "however , what is more likely is that our result provides indirect evidence for significant evolution in one or both of @xmath136 and @xmath87 .",
    "we also present followup observations of the @xmath8 candidate reported in @xcite . with deep imaging from the mmt",
    "we find a 2.6@xmath3 detection at @xmath13 , which suggests an intermediate - redshift interloper .",
    "this interpretation of the former @xmath8 candididate , jd2325 + 1433 , is more consistent with upper limits reported by bouwens et al .",
    "( 2005 , 2008,2009 ) , as well as the upper limit which we find in this study .",
    "the fact that this interloper has such an extremely red @xmath4  - @xmath28 and lbg - like sed at longer wavelengths means that similar sources at fainter magnitudes will require a large investment in optical imaging in future surveys , such as those with wfc3 and in the longer term , jwst and future thirty - meter class telescopes .",
