    "the @xmath0-state potts model is of fundamental interest in two - dimensional statistical physics .",
    "it arises in an amazing number of different contexts in mathematics and theoretical physics alike : algebra , combinatorics , probability theory , graph theory , integrability , conformal field theory ( cft ) , stochastic loewner evolution ( sle ) , etc .",
    "thus progress in understanding the potts model serves as a useful gauge for progress in many of these fields .    via its underlying algebraic formulation  in terms of the temperley - lieb algebra @xcite  the potts model can be recast in several similar ways , but which do however present subtle differences .",
    "its formulation as a model of completely packed loops with non - local weights is prototypical within the large ( and still growing ) class of so - called _ loop models _ in classical statistical mechanics .",
    "such models push the limits of cft , as they present non - unitary and logarithmic features @xcite , and they link directly to physics - inspired models of extended objects , such as polymers .",
    "the loops underlying the potts model role as convenient lattice regularizations of sle traces @xcite .",
    "they can also be interpreted as particle trajectories in various models of disordered systems , such as the spin quantum hall effect @xcite .",
    "studying several _ coupled potts models _ is a challenge for all of the techniques listed above , and also serves as a worthwhile purpose on its own right .    in particular , coupled potts models",
    "arise naturally when studying _ quantum _ loop models @xcite .",
    "each configuration in the classical loop model is a basis element of the hilbert space of the quantum loop model .",
    "the reason why two coupled copies of the loop model arise in this context is elementary quantum mechanics .",
    "when computing expectation values , one of course weights by the wavefunction squared .",
    "thus one loop model comes from the bra , and the other from the ket .",
    "our results are very useful for quantum loop models , because the critical phase we find below in the classical model implies the existence of a phase with _",
    "topological order _ in the quantum loop model with completely packed loops @xcite . in a topological phase",
    ", the excitations are fractionalized , and have anyonic statistics .",
    "these features are possible when the ground state of the quantum system is a sum over different loop configurations ; the non - locality of loops makes anyonic braiding possible . for the anyonic excitations to be deconfined",
    ", the underlying classical loop model must be critical , so that all lengths of loops appear in the partition function .",
    "coupled potts models are also at play when studying a single potts model with quenched random bond disorder . using the replica trick , this corresponds to coupling @xmath2 pure potts models via the product of their energy operators , followed by the formal limit @xmath3 . for @xmath4 and in the limit of weak non - frustrated disorder , this can be done within the perturbative renormalization group ( rg ) approach of cft @xcite .",
    "there exists ample numerical evidence that the replica symmetry is not broken in this case .",
    "moreover , the formal expressions obtained for the critical exponents corresponding to @xmath5 integer have been identified ",
    "order by order in the perturbation  with those of particular critical points of @xmath2 coupled lattice models .",
    "if exact results for these critical points could be obtained exactly , their analytical continuation to the @xmath6 limit would provide exact results for the random - bond potts model @xcite . in this context , the case of two coupled models to be studied here is somewhat particular , since the rg flows depend on the coupling @xmath7 in the combination @xmath8 .    in the present study",
    "we assume ( as in @xcite ) that the coupled potts models are self - dual , i.e. , they are left invariant under the combined duality transformation of both underlying models . although it is known in the special case of @xmath9 that mutually dual pairs of critical points",
    "do exist , it seems plausible that self - duality will generically allow for the highest multicritical  and thus most interesting  behavior .    among the directions that we leave for future investigation ,",
    "one of the most elusive is undoubtedly to provide a coulomb gas ( cg ) description for coupled potts models . a putative cg construction would allow one to compute the critical exponents of certain non - local operators analytically , an issue that we only pursue numerically here .",
    "suffice it to say that our analytical result for the central charge at the new self - dual critical point hints at a cg with three height components , but only two of those are easy to identify geometrically .",
    "this is not without reminding us of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : potts ]",
    "we introduce the models to be studied , and summarize our main results . in section  [ sec : critpoint ]",
    "we derive the location and universality class of a new self - dual critical point .",
    "the cornerstone of the arguments is a level - rank duality in a related @xmath10 symmetric integrable model .",
    "numerical calculations are used to verify the consistency of the proposed phase diagram , and to give results for the dimensions of watermelon operators at the new critical point . in section  [ sec : critphase ] we argue that adjacent to the new critical point , the loop model possesses a critical phase , with parameter - independent critical exponents .",
    "we provide evidence that the phase transition into this phase is simultaneously first and second order . in section  [ sec : dilute ] we generalize the model to include vacancies .",
    "we argue that dilution is an irrelevant perturbation of the completely packed model .",
    "the phase diagram for the dilute model is presented .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : differentq ] we generalize our results to the case where the two coupled potts model have a different number of states .",
    "the original formulation of the @xmath0-state potts model places a spin @xmath11 taking integer values @xmath12 on each site of some lattice . in this paper",
    "we shall discuss exclusively the square lattice , but we expect by universality that our results will apply qualitatively and sometimes quantitatively to other lattices .",
    "the potts model has nearest - neighbor interactions invariant under the permutation group @xmath13 , so that the interaction energy @xmath14 only depends on whether adjacent spins @xmath11 and @xmath15 are the same or different .",
    "the potts model on the square lattice has a kramers - wannier ( high- to low - temperature ) duality @xcite .",
    "this is a non - local map of spins which preserves the bulk free energy .",
    "the self - dual point is critical @xcite when @xmath16 . in a field - theory description of the region around these critical points ,",
    "taking the temperature off the self - dual value corresponds to perturbing by the energy operator @xmath17 ( the continuum limit of @xmath18 ) .",
    "the energy operator is odd under duality , @xmath19 , so that perturbing by this operator with one sign describes the high - temperature phase , while the other sign gives the low - temperature phase .",
    "although the original definition of the potts model requires @xmath0 to be an integer , there exist generalizations to all @xmath0 which are still commonly known as the potts model .",
    "we will treat two closely - related but distinct models , which we refer to as the _ loop _ and the _ height _ models .",
    "the transfer matrices of the original potts model and the two generalizations are most conveniently defined in terms of the temperley - lieb algebra ; each model then corresponds to a different representation .",
    "the algebra for a system of width @xmath20 has @xmath20 generators @xmath21 acting at positions @xmath22 as well as the identity @xmath23 , which obey the relations @xcite @xmath24 the transfer matrix at the self - dual isotropic point for width @xmath20 is then @xmath25 where @xmath26 for the ferromagnetic self - dual point , and @xmath27 for the ( non - unitary ) antiferromagnetic self - dual point .",
    "the partition function for an @xmath28 lattice with periodic boundary conditions in the `` time '' direction is then given by @xmath29 in this formulation , duality amounts to exchanging @xmath21 with @xmath23 on each plaquette .",
    "it is convenient to parameterize @xmath30 defining the parameter @xmath31 .",
    "when @xmath31 is an integer obeying @xmath32 ( so that @xmath33 ) representations of the algebra have special properties .",
    "one important one discussed below is the existence of a height representation , with positive and locally defined boltzmann weights .",
    "having @xmath31 integer is also desirable for the quantum loop models , because the existence of the jones - wenzl projector at these values means that the number of ground states remains finite even when the theory is defined on a torus @xcite .",
    "( left picture ) and @xmath21 ( right picture ) on a pair of strands at positions @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the transfer ( time ) direction is upwards .",
    "each picture corresponds to a plaquette of the dual lattice . ]    in the _ loop representation _ of the temperley - lieb algebra , the generators act on @xmath20 strands , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tl ] .",
    "the result is a _ completely packed _ set of self - avoiding and mutually - avoiding loops .",
    "complete packing means that the loops cover every link of the square lattice ; the only degrees of freedom are the two ways in which the loops avoid each other at each vertex of the lattice .",
    "the transfer matrix adds @xmath20 plaquettes to the dual lattice as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : transfer ] , so it is acting on a zig - zag row of @xmath20 plaquettes . multiplying out the product in ( [ transfermatrix ] )",
    "makes it obvious that each configuration in the completely packed loop model appears with a coefficient which is just @xmath36 when @xmath26 , and @xmath37 when @xmath38 .",
    "note in particular that the parameter @xmath31 in ( [ paramk ] ) does not need to be an integer for the loop representation to be defined .     on a zig - zag row of @xmath20 plaquettes .",
    "the left ( resp .",
    "right ) picture illustrates periodic ( resp .",
    "free , or reflecting ) boundary conditions in the space direction.,width=529 ]    a remarkable property of the loop representation is that the boltzmann weight of a configuration depends only on topological properties of the loops .",
    "( in fact , for this reason the loop representation of the temperley - lieb algebra underlies the jones polynomial in knot theory . )",
    "the local topological properties follow directly from the temperley - lieb algebra ( [ tlalg ] ) .",
    "the second relation means that configurations which are topologically equivalent receive the same weight , while he first relation means that a closed loop not wrapping around a cycle receives a weight @xmath39 relative to the configuration without the loop .    to evaluate the full partition function in the loop representation ,",
    "we need to define the trace in ( [ zt ] ) , which corresponds to imposing periodic boundary conditions in the `` time '' direction .",
    "it is natural to require that closed loops wrapping around the time direction also receive a weight @xmath39 .",
    "thus the weight of a given loop configuration @xmath40 is found simply by counting the number @xmath41 of loops is the configuration : @xmath42 this defines the markov trace of elements of the temperley - lieb algebra .",
    "a loop is inherently a non - local object , so even though the boltzmann weights here are all positive for @xmath43 , the corresponding field theory is typically not unitary .",
    "when @xmath31 is an integer , the temperley - lieb algebra has a _ height representation _ where the resulting lattice model ( often known as rsos , or restricted solid - on - solid , model ) has positive boltzmann weights @xcite .",
    "the heights @xmath44 live on the dual lattice , so that each plaquette illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : transfer ] has four heights at its corners .",
    "heights of neighboring sites satisfy the rsos constraint @xmath45 .",
    "the generator @xmath21 now acts locally as @xmath46 and the trace in ( [ zt ] ) is simply the usual matrix trace .    the connection between the loop and height models ",
    "valid when both are defined , i.e. , for @xmath31 integer  is based on exact partition function identities @xcite that hold strictly speaking only when the underlying lattice is _ planar_. imposing doubly periodic boundary conditions leads to further subtleties , which are however not important in the context of this work .",
    "this paper is devoted to studying _ two coupled self - dual potts models _ , in both their loop and height formulations .",
    "we thus consider two potts models on the same lattice , described respectively by two independent sets of temperley - lieb generators labeled by @xmath21 and @xmath47 . here",
    "we require that @xmath0 be the same for the two models ; later we will consider the more general case .",
    "we require that the coupled model remain self - dual under the combination of the duality transformations in both models , and that it be invariant under exchange of the two models .",
    "the transfer matrix remains of the form ( [ transfermatrix ] ) , with @xmath48 for each plaquette given by @xmath49        in the loop representation , this is very simple to represent ; the four possible configurations at each vertex are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig:4vertices ] .",
    "the two copies mean that on each link there are two species of loops .",
    "loops of each species can not cross at vertices , but the two species can cross . the partition function is a sum over all configurations @xmath40 and @xmath50 of the two species of loops : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the number of times the rightmost two vertices in fig .",
    "[ fig:4vertices ] occur .",
    "this is a completely packed version of the loop model discussed in @xcite ; we will make contact with the results discussed there when we discuss the dilute generalization in section  [ sec : dilute ] .",
    "when the parameter @xmath53 and @xmath54 , we have decoupled ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic models respectively , both critical .",
    "when @xmath55 , @xmath48 describes a single @xmath56-state potts model , because the products @xmath57 generate a temperley - lieb algebra ( [ tlalg ] ) with @xmath0 replaced by @xmath56 . in the loop representation , @xmath55",
    "amounts to requiring that the loops in the two models be identical , so that each loop gets a weight @xmath58 .",
    "taking the dual of one of the two models exchanges @xmath59 , so we restrict our attention to @xmath60 .    in the height representation , the theory remains unitary for @xmath61 .",
    "this follows by explicitly examining the boltzmann weights ; they all remain positive except for one type of plaquette .",
    "namely , a negative boltzmann weight occurs for @xmath62 for all plaquettes where the heights in one rsos model differ in the time direction , while the heights in the other rsos model differ in the space direction .",
    "because of the periodic boundary conditions in the time direction , there must be an even number of such plaquettes .",
    "thus one can flip the sign of these weights without changing @xmath63 , giving a local model with all positive boltzmann weights .",
    "this remains true until @xmath64 , where other weights change sign .    for @xmath65 ,",
    "perturbing @xmath66 away from @xmath67 is marginal and preserves the criticality .",
    "this is easy to see in the height formulation , because @xmath65 corresponds to @xmath9 : ( [ coupled ] ) then describes two coupled ising models .",
    "this is known as the ashkin - teller model along its self - dual line , and the physics is well understood in the height formulation @xcite .",
    "the model remains critical until @xmath55 , where it is equivalent to the critical 4-state potts model . for @xmath62 , it is no longer critical .    at the decoupled points for @xmath16 , the models are critical and so described by a conformal field theory . in the height model for @xmath53 ,",
    "the conformal field theories describing these critical models are known as the unitary minimal models , and have central charge @xcite @xmath68 the behavior of the decoupled height models at the antiferromagnetic critical point @xmath54 is somewhat trickier to describe .",
    "the negative boltzmann weights make the theory non - unitary . however , if one instead uses a hamiltonian formulation of a 1 + 1 dimensional quantum theory , the hamiltonian corresponding to @xmath54 is simply @xmath69 , which is hermitian .",
    "the unitary conformal field theory describing the continuum limit of this hamiltonian is known as the @xmath70 parafermion model , whose central charge is @xmath71    in the loop model , ( [ cmin ] ) remains true for @xmath53 . however , since @xmath31 is now a continuous parameter , the cases @xmath53 and @xmath54 are now linked by analytic continuation , @xmath72 .",
    "note that under this transformation @xmath73 , which is tantamount to @xmath74 as required .",
    "in particular , for @xmath54 the correct central charge is then obtained by analytically continuing ( [ cmin ] ) and reads @xmath75 when @xmath31 is integer , the corresponding critical theory completely disappears from @xmath63 due to massive cancellations @xcite of eigenvalues in the markov trace ( [ zt ] ) , and what remains is tantamount to the height model .",
    "taking @xmath66 away from @xmath67 is a perturbation odd under each the individual dualities of the potts models , and even under the combination .",
    "the simplest operator with these properties is given by the product of the energy operators @xmath76 of the two models .",
    "this operator has dimension @xmath77 , so it is relevant for @xmath78 ; it is the only relevant one with the appropriate symmetries .",
    "thus the question becomes whether this perturbation causes a flow to a non - trivial critical point .",
    "compelling evidence suggests that there is no such critical point , although no definitive argument rules it out , namely , this perturbation is integrable in the field theory @xcite , and the only consistent @xmath79 matrices describing this perturbed theory are massive , indicating there is no flow to a critical point .",
    "matrices given in @xcite for @xmath78 are wrong  they are the level - rank duals of the correct ones , in the technical sense described below .",
    "] moreover , this is consistent with the fact that at @xmath55 , the model for @xmath78 is non - critical , because the @xmath56-state potts model at its self - dual point is critical only for @xmath80 .",
    "thus it is natural to guess that for @xmath78 , the flow goes from @xmath53 to @xmath55 , the latter being a stable non - critical fixed point of the renormalization group .",
    "our numerical work supports this picture .",
    "the interesting new physics occurs for @xmath66 negative , where we find a new critical point .",
    "we present this calculation in section [ sec : critpoint ] , where we derive the exact location of the critical point and determine which conformal field theory describes its continuum limit .",
    "and the decoupled antiferromagnetic critical point @xmath81 represents the critical phase . ]    the arguments given above  in conjunction with numerical calculations presented in section  [ sec : numdense ] below ",
    "lead to the phase diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_dense ] .",
    "the point @xmath79 is the strongly coupled point @xmath55 , which is non - critical for @xmath78 .",
    "the point @xmath82 is the new critical point at @xmath83 , to be discussed in detail in section  [ sec : critpoint ] below .",
    "the points @xmath84 and @xmath81 are the decoupled ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic critical points at @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the characteristics of @xmath81 differ between the height and the loop models . finally , the point @xmath85 is a non - critical point which occurs only in the height model , and which is required for the consistency of its rg flow diagram .",
    "note in particular that the phase @xmath86 is non - critical in the height model , but critical in the loop model .",
    "the latter is an example of a `` berker - kadanoff '' phase @xcite .",
    "the point @xmath64 , the lowest value of @xmath66 where the height representation is unitary , is special .",
    "it is quite important for quantum loop models , and it lies in the critical phase for @xmath87 , and is the new critical point for @xmath88 .",
    "when @xmath64 , the weight of each configuration can explicitly be given in terms of a chromatic polynomial squared @xcite .",
    "this can be seen for the square lattice by noting that @xmath89 where @xmath90 .",
    "the projectors @xmath91 and @xmath92 are orthogonal .",
    "we divide the square lattice on which the loops live into the usual two sublattices ( even and odd ) .",
    "low_-temperature expansion of a single potts model is found from writing @xmath93 on sublattice 1 , and @xmath94 on sublattice 2 , and then associating a domain wall with each @xmath91 term included on sublattice 1 , and @xmath95 on sublattice 2 .",
    "it is easy to check that these walls can not end , although there can be three or four walls touching each site .",
    "if we sum over the spins for any fixed domain - wall configuration , the weight per graph is proportional to the chromatic polynomial of the dual lattice .",
    "this is easiest to see by simply proving it for all @xmath0 integer in the original potts representation ; by definition of the chromatic polynomial it must apply for all @xmath0 . thus coupling potts models at @xmath96",
    "corresponds to requiring that the low - temperature expansion of the two be the same .",
    "( this is proved for any lattice with four links touching each site in @xcite . )",
    "the behavior of the low - temperature expansion at @xmath96 is therefore analogous to that of the completely packed ( fortuin - kasteleyn @xcite ) loop expansion at @xmath55 .",
    "in this section we show that at a particular value @xmath97 , the coupled potts models have a critical point . in accord with the discussion of the previous section",
    ", this value must be negative , and we show here that @xmath98 the conformal field theory describing this critical theory is the coset model @xcite @xmath99 with central charge @xmath100      at the value @xmath97 , the coupled theory is integrable .",
    "we show this by using level - rank duality to write the transfer matrix here in terms of another algebra , the @xmath10 birman - murakami - wenzl ( bmw ) algebra @xcite .",
    "lattice models involving this algebra were introduced long ago @xcite , and it is possible to show that integrability follows directly from algebraic properties , and so applies to any representation @xcite . in this more general",
    "setting , the andrews - baxter - forrester height models @xcite discussed are associated with @xmath1 and its quantum - group algebra deformation @xmath101 .",
    "the bmw algebra was introduced to study representations of the braid group and find new knot and link invariants .",
    "braid generators in general satisfy @xmath102 for @xmath103 , and @xmath104 this is known as the `` third reidemeister move '' in knot theory .",
    "the braid generators can be inverted : @xmath105 ( the second reidemeister move ) . a useful graphical representation of the braid group is given by each @xmath106 and @xmath107 as acting on two strands like the temperley - lieb generators , but where @xmath108 and @xmath109 correspond to overcrossings and undercrossings respectively .",

    "this bmw algebra is special because the algebra @xmath122 is the direct product of two @xmath1 algebras .",
    "one should think of the strands in @xmath111 as behaving in the vector representation of the quantum - group algebra @xmath123 . as with ordinary lie algebras",

    "( this is the braid - group representation underlying the jones polynomial . )",
    "so less abstractly , given two independent representations labeled @xmath21 and @xmath47 of the tl algebra , we can construct one of the @xmath121 bmw algebra by defining @xmath132 where given the definition of @xmath119 in ( [ xdef ] ) , we have @xmath133 for this representation of @xmath121 .",

    "one can see this by utilizing a deformation of these models which preserves the integrability @xcite .",
    "this enables one for example to compute the free energy by using the inversion - relation method @xcite . from this one",
    "sees that as the deformation parameter is tuned back to the trigonometric weights , the free energy behaves non - analytically , as it does at a critical point .",

    "[ at @xmath53 the perron - frobenius theorem prevents such a singularity from occurring . ] in between @xmath54 and @xmath97 the behavior is non - critical , the effective central charge being zero .",
    "the loop models we have studied thus far are completely packed : every site of the lattice is covered by strands .",
    "it is natural to relax this constraint , and consider `` dilute '' loops .",
    "we show in this section that the critical point and phase still persist for fairly large amounts of dilution .",
    "the dilute model we discuss here requires that loops of the two species be on the same links : they are `` glued '' together .",
    "this does not reduce to a single loop model , because when two loops meet at the same vertex , the four possibilities in fig .",
    "[ fig:4vertices ] are still possible . for reasons we will discuss below , the physics does not seem to be changed by whether or not one allows vertices with the pair of loops going straight through .",

    "several indirect arguments were given as to why this dilute loop model will have a critical point described precisely by the _",
    "same _ coset conformal field theory ( [ coset ] ) as we showed above described the critical point at @xmath97 in the completely packed limit . in this section",
    "we review these arguments , use numerics to provide further strong support for them , and map out the full phase diagram of the dilute loop model .",
    "the arguments presented in @xcite were the reverse of those presented above . in @xcite , critical theories known to describe the coset models ( [ coset ] ) were shown to be closely related to this dilute loop model .",
    "one argument involves an integrable lattice height model @xcite which has a critical point whose continuum limit is described by the coset ( [ coset ] ) . it was shown that in a certain off - critical limit , the height model reduces precisely to the dilute loop model .",
    "an integrable line of couplings connects this limit to the critical point , so that the corner - transfer matrix eigenvalues and hence the local height probabilities can be computed along this line .",
    "the configurations which dominate this computation are precisely those of the dilute loop model .",
    "moreover , the remaining configurations can be described by a more general dilute loop model , where multiple strands of each species are allowed on a link .",
    "the fact that the configurations with multiply occupied links do not dominate the corner - transfer matrix computation is a strong sign that at the critical point , allowing or disallowing such configurations is irrelevant .",
    "thus the dilute loop model discussed above should still have a critical point described by ( [ coset ] ) .",
    "another argument briefly mentioned in @xcite comes from studying the @xmath79 matrix of the integrable field theory at and near this critical point .",
    "a compelling picture of the relation between loop models and integrable @xmath79 matrices was presented in @xcite .",
    "there it was argued that one could think of the worldlines of particles in the integrable @xmath243 @xmath79 matrix description as dilute loops in the corresponding classical 2d lattice model .",
    "this observation was made precise in @xcite , where it was shown that the @xmath79 matrices for the @xmath244 perturbation of the minimal models can be expressed in terms of the temperley - lieb generators , which in turn have the loop representation described in section ( [ sec : potts ] ) . for the @xmath79 matrix @xmath245 for the minimal model of central charge @xmath246 $ ] , the weight of closed loops in this representation is @xmath247 ( note the shift in the denominator from the weight of the loops in the completely packed lattice model ) .",
    "it is very natural to think of these world lines as domain walls in the 2d classical picture , and this @xmath79 matrix indeed describes the loop model in its _ dilute _ phase . off the critical point , these domain walls have an effective weight per unit length .    the coupled loop models can be discussed in the same @xmath79 matrix picture .",
    "in fact , it is no more difficult to treat the more general case @xmath248 which will be discussed in more detail in the next section .",
    "this conformal field theory is integrable when perturbed by the ( 1,1;adjoint ) operator ( the analog of @xmath249 in the minimal models ) of dimension @xmath250 .",
    "this integrable field theory describes the lattice height model of @xcite near the critical point , along the line of couplings mentioned above .",
    "the @xmath79 matrices for this field theory have the interesting property that they decompose into the tensor product of @xmath79 matrices of the minimal models @xmath251 @xcite .",
    "each of @xmath252 and @xmath253 involves a single temperley - lieb algebra , so their tensor product can be written in terms of tensor products of temperley - lieb generators , namely @xmath254 , @xmath255 , @xmath256 , and @xmath257 .",
    "the loop representation of these is exactly that pictured in ( [ fig:4vertices ] ) above !",
    "thus , the heuristic interpretation of this @xmath79 matrix is that it describes a loop model exactly like ours .",
    "since the @xmath79 matrix is a tensor product , each particle has structure in both temperley - lieb algebras , so its worldlines must be described as doubled lines , and the lines of the different copies can cross at a vertex .    still more evidence that the dilute loop model has",
    "a critical point comes from another solvable model @xcite closely related to our dilute loop model .",
    "the models in @xcite are based on the `` dilute bmw '' algebra , generalizing those of @xcite with weights ( [ ru ] ) to allow heights on adjacent sites to be the same . in the graphical representation , this amounts to relaxing the complete - packing requirement . as we have described above in section",
    "[ sec : critpoint ] , the @xmath122 bmw algebra decomposes into the direct product of two temperley - lieb algebras .",
    "thus the dilute @xmath122 bmw algebra in its loop representations describes the same dilute loop model . to make it integrable",
    ", one must tune various couplings , including that of the vertex where the loops go straight across .",
    "unfortunately , the corner transfer matrix computation of these models does not seem to have been done , so the cft describing this critical point has not yet been identified .",
    "however , by using the inversion relation method , one can easily compute a critical exponent at each of the two critical points in this model . at the critical point where the weights favor dilute loops , the critical exponent found corresponds to an operator of dimension @xmath258 , which indeed is present in the coset model ( [ coset ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , at the isotropic point some boltzmann weights are negative ( although the corresponding @xmath259 dimensional quantum hamiltonian is hermitian ) , so it is not possible to make a precise comparison with our dilute loop model .",
    "all this is compelling evidence that the dilute loop has a critical point with the same conformal field theory description as that of the completely packed model at @xmath97 .",
    "minor modifications in the definition of the the loop model , such as allowing multiple strands on a link , or loops to go straight through a vertex , do not change the conclusion .",
    "there are no marginal operators in this coset conformal field theory describing the dilute and completely packed critical point .",
    "thus there should be a flow in the loop model connecting the two points .",
    "several compelling pieces of evidence imply that the completely packed critical point is stable , i.e. , including dilution is an irrelevant perturbation .",
    "it has long been known that dilution is irrelevant in the context of a single potts model .",
    "an initial coulomb gas - type ( and thus non - rigorous ) argument @xcite was subsequently placed on firm ground through the integrability analysis of the most general model of self - avoiding loops defined on the square lattice that is compatible with an o(@xmath260 ) symmetry @xcite . for a given value of @xmath261 ,",
    "this model admits five distinct integrable points with isotropic weights at the vertices .",
