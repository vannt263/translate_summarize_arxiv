    "the light ion induced reactions with neutron - rich targets can be considered as one of the possible avenues to study the nuclei in the neutron rich side of n - z chart .",
    "the population of the neutron - rich nuclei in a @xmath2 150 region with sizable yield is difficult by either fission reaction , even with trans - uranium elements , or by fusion - evaporation reaction with stable heavy - ion beams  @xcite .",
    "the information on the light - ion induced reaction cross - section ( cs ) is required to perform the spectroscopy of the low - lying states of these nuclei which has a lot of current physics interests  @xcite .",
    "one of the important aspects is the presence of long lived @xmath6-decaying isomers , in odd - odd isotopes of this mass region , which can be identified directly from the information on the reaction cs  @xcite .",
    "the proton induced fusion evaporation reactions in this mass region are dominated by few neutron evaporation channels with a small contribution to the single neutron and particle evaporation channels .",
    "however , it is very important to estimate the low cs of the residues produced from the particle evaporation channels , which can be used in meaningful experiments with a suitable tagging device coupled to a high efficiency @xmath4 array  @xcite .",
    "several of these experiments in a @xmath2 150 region are being explored at vecc , kolkata  @xcite .",
    "the p induced reactions on stable targets can be used as the surrogate reaction  @xcite for calculating the n capture cs for the unstable neutron rich nuclei .",
    "this has immense importance in the field of basic as well as applied nuclear physics , _ viz .",
    "_ , nuclear astrophysics , nuclear reactor technology , etc  @xcite . in the universe ,",
    "the synthesis of nuclei a @xmath2 150 region mainly takes place via slow and rapid neutron capture processes .",
    "hence the knowledge on the cs for the n - capture reactions are required for understanding the nucleosynthesis path as well as the abundance of the nuclei .",
    "however , these reaction cs are difficult to measure mainly because of the difficulty in preparing the neutron rich radioactive targets with very low half lives .",
    "hence , the p induced surrogate reactions can provide very important inputs to the stellar model calculations where the n capture cs is calculated with the information on the compound nucleus formation cs , obtained by measuring that from the surrogate reactions .",
    "this is more important in the nuclei which are at or near the branch point having a long half lives for nuclear @xmath6 decay .",
    "the nuclei produced as residues in the proton induced reaction on @xmath0nd lie near the branch point nucleus @xmath7pm .",
    "there is almost no data for the light ion induced reactions in this mass region , when explored in the recent compiled databases  @xcite .",
    "hence , the study of cs for the p - induced reaction on the neutron - rich targets in a@xmath2 150 region is important and the said study can also provide inputs to the different statistical model calculations .",
    "the measurement of the p - induced reaction cs with the nd target has important additional interest also .",
    "the decay of @xmath0nd nucleus , one of the very promising candidates for neutrinoless double beta decay  @xcite , is being studied in several important underground experimental facilities  @xcite . in these experiments , nd is either loaded in the scintillator material or is used as foils within the time projection chamber . during transportation of the nd material to the underground laboratories",
    ", it is exposed to the cosmic background and produces several long lived isotopes from the light charged particle induced reactions  @xcite .",
    "these isotopes generate the possible backgrounds in the @xmath0nd double beta decay experiments with very low real yields  @xcite .",
    "a measure for the majority of this background can be obtained from the cs measurement of the proton induced reactions on different nd isotopes as proton constitutes @xmath2 90@xmath1 of the total cosmic particles hitting the earth s surface .",
    "in the present work , the excitation functions of the ( p , xnyp ) reactions have been measured using stacked - foil activation technique  @xcite with the 97.65@xmath1 enriched @xmath0nd target .",
    "a similar work was done by o. lebeda _",
    "_  @xcite using @xmath8nd target .",
    "a preliminary result of our measurement with enriched target was reported in ref .",
    "following our preliminary report , another set of measurement has been reported by o. lebeda _",
    "et al . , _  @xcite which also used @xmath8nd target .",
    "the use of enriched nd target in our work has facilitated the measurement of absolute cs for the p - induced reaction on @xmath0nd for the first time .",
    "the measurement also provides a completely new set of data on the excitation function for the present reaction with a large number of data points in the proton energy range of 7 - 15 mev . considering the coulomb barrier for the present system to be @xmath2 8.5 mev , the fusion probability below the threshold by 1.5 mev has been determined in the present work . the measurement of cs for @xmath0nd(p , n)@xmath0pm , @xmath0nd(p,2n)@xmath9pm and @xmath0nd(p , p@xmath5n)@xmath9nd / @xmath0nd(p , d)@xmath9nd reactions have been measured giving rise to a total fusion cs for the p+@xmath0nd reaction .",
    "the experimental results have been corroboarated with statistical model calculation using different codes , _ viz . , _",
    "cascade  @xcite , alice  @xcite and empire3.1  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0nd ( p , xnyp ) reaction was carried out using 7 to 15 mev proton beams provided by k = 130 avf cyclotron at variable energy cyclotron centre , kolkata .",
    "the @xmath0nd target was prepared by electro - deposition technique , starting from commercially available 97.65@xmath1 enriched powdered oxide sample(nd@xmath10o@xmath11 ) , on a 0.3 mil thick aluminium ( al ) foil .",
    "the nd : o atom ratio in the deposited target was estimated by neutron activation of both the powdered material and the prepared target . the neutron beam of flux @xmath2 1.8 x 10@xmath12 neutrons /@xmath13/sec was available from the research reactor facility ` dhruva ' at bhabha atomic research centre , mumbai .",
    "the nd : o ratio was found to be 1.6:3 in the electro - deposited target compared to 2:3 in the powdered sample . this atom ratio of 1.6:3 was used in the subsequent calculation .",
    "the isotopic impurities in the target material consisted of 0.50@xmath1 @xmath14nd , 0.31@xmath1 @xmath15nd , 0.68@xmath1 @xmath16nd , 0.23@xmath1 @xmath17nd , 0.47@xmath1 @xmath18nd and 0.26@xmath1 @xmath7nd , as per the data sheet provided by the supplier . the thickness of the targets used in the experiment was within the range of 650 @xmath19g/@xmath13 to 900 @xmath19g/@xmath13 as determined by accurate weight difference method using analytical balance .",
    "the cs were measured by using the stacked - foil activation technique where several target stacks were irradiated with the proton beam .",
    "each stack contained copper ( 25@xmath19 m ) , al ( 25@xmath19 m ) and tantalum ( 12.5@xmath19 m ) as the beam flux monitor , catcher and degrader respectively .",
    "the number of targets in each stack was limited to a maximum value of four .",
    "a typical stack with its components has been shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1-stack ] .",
    "the target stacks were prepared in such a way that every stack provides one proton energy of irradiation common to that with the previous stack .",
    "single targets along with a monitor foil and the catchers were also irradiated at few proton energies throughout the range of 7 to 15 mev .    -0.5",
    "cm     the beam spot on the target was confined to 6.0 mm by using al collimator in front of the target .",
    "the energy of the incident beam was determined from the knowledge of magnetic field , extraction radius and charge state of the accelerated ion . the maximum uncertainty in proton beam energy is known to be @xmath2100 kev in the present energy range .",
    "the degradation of the beam energy as a function of the depth of the stack was calculated with the help of the ` physical calculator ' available inside the code ` lise++ '  @xcite giving the beam energy and the target thickness as the input parameters . the beam intensity for each stack",
    "was calculated by using the known excitation function for @xmath8 cu(p , xn ) @xmath20zn reactions .",
    "the absolute yields of the delayed @xmath4 rays corresponding to the decay of the individual evaporation residues were used to determine the excitation function of the p - induced reaction on @xmath0nd . following this method , both the target and the monitor foils were counted along with their respective catcher foils on a 50@xmath1 hpge detector after allowing a cooling time of 1 - 2 h from the end of bombardment ( eob ) .",
    "the irradiated foils were placed at an appropriate distance from the detector to maintain a dead time of @xmath21 10@xmath1 .",
    "this was further supported by the absence of any sum peak in the @xmath4 spectrum .",
    "the activities obtained from the stack irradiations were initially counted over a period of @xmath210 h , considering three half lives ( @xmath22 ) of the ground state of @xmath0pm ( @xmath22 = 2.68 h ) .",
    "each counting was performed for 10 min at an interval of @xmath2 30 min .",
    "the counting for @xmath0pm could also provide the data for @xmath9nd ( @xmath22 = 1.73 h ) because of their similar @xmath22 values . for @xmath9pm ( @xmath22 = 53.08",
    "h ) , a similar sequence of counting was done over a period of one week where the individual counting had a duration of 30 min to 2 h at an interval of one day .",
    "the counting for @xmath0pm and @xmath9pm were done keeping the irradiated foils at a distance of 15 cm and 7 cm from the detector respectively .",
    "the absolute efficiency of the detector at these two positions was estimated by using the standard @xmath23eu and @xmath24ba sources with known activity .",
    "the energy calibration of the detector was also performed using the same set of sources .",
    "the data were acquired and analysed using a canberra digital data processing system genie 2000 .",
    "the cs values ( @xmath25 ) of the different evaporation channels produced from the p+@xmath0nd reaction were estimated from the knowledge of the activity ( a@xmath26 ) of the respective evaporation residue at eob , number of target atoms ( n@xmath26 ) and proton beam flux ( @xmath27 ) by using the following equation : @xmath28}\\\\     \\nonumber\\ ] ] the term in the parenthesis is known as the saturation factor used for correcting the activity lost during time of irradiation ( t@xmath29 ) .",
    "a@xmath26 is calculated from the yield(n@xmath26 ) of the characteristic @xmath4 ray at eob , emitted following the decay of any particular evaporation residue , by using the relation @xmath30 , where , @xmath31 is the efficiency of the detector and @xmath32 is the abundance for that particular @xmath4 ray .",
    "the beam flux(@xmath27 ) was calculated using the same equation  [ eqn - cs ] and taking the cs values for the reaction @xmath8cu(p , xn)@xmath33zn from literature  @xcite .",
    "the errors in n , @xmath34 and @xmath31(@xmath211.5@xmath1 , @xmath212@xmath1 and @xmath215@xmath1 respectively as discussed below ) were taken in calculating the error in @xmath27 .",
    "the error in n arises from the uncertainty in the thickness measurement of the target foil and has been considered to be @xmath211.5@xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath4 rays , used in the cs calculation , were chosen in such a way that they have significant abundance and appear prominently in the spectrum . a representative @xmath4 spectrum obtained from the irradiated target along with its catcher foil",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2-totalspec ] .",
    "0.5 cm -1.0 cm -1.5 cm    most of the @xmath4 rays were identified to be originated from the decay of @xmath0pm , @xmath9pm and @xmath9nd nuclei .",
    "the @xmath9pm and @xmath9nd nuclei were found to be produced only above e@xmath3=7 mev and e@xmath3=11.5 mev , respectively .",
    "the @xmath4 lines coming from the target impurities have been observed to be very negligible .",
    "some @xmath4 transitions were found to be present due to the activated products of al - foils used in the experiment .",
    "the 1165.75 , 285.95 and 114.31 kev transitions were used for calculating the activity of @xmath0pm , @xmath9pm and @xmath9nd nuclei , respectively .",
    "the activities of @xmath0pm and @xmath9nd were also cross checked by using the 1324.52 kev and 211.31 kev transitions , respectively . similarly , the cu - monitor along with its catcher was counted to obtain the yield of the 1115.55 kev transition .",
    "this originates from the decay of @xmath33zn and was used for calculating the beam flux utilizing the reaction @xmath8cu(p , xn)@xmath33zn as mentioned above .",
    "the relevant details of the above four @xmath4 lines are furnished in table  [ gamma ] .",
    "the abundance values of these @xmath4 lines were taken from the ensdf data base  @xcite and corrected for their respective conversion coefficients while using for the activity calculation .",
    "the said conversion coefficients have been calculated by using the briccv2.3s code avaiable in  @xcite , using the multipolarities taken from the ensdf databases  @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab - cs ]",
    "the experimental excitation functions were corroborated using the statistical model codes cascade  @xcite , alice  @xcite and empire3.1  @xcite .",
    "all the calculations could provide an accurate overall description for all the excitation functions , however , varied in the prediction of the exact position of the maximum for the ( p , n ) channel as well as the ascending or descending slopes .",
    "a variation between the experimental data and the theoretical prediction was observed for the ( p , 2n ) channel after e@xmath3 = 12 mev .",
    "however , this deviation may be accounted considering the multitude of uncertainties and the limitations embedded in the theoretical codes . in the following subsections , the relevant details on each of the model calculations have been furnished .",
    "the calculation with cascade code assumes the formation of a compound nucleus in statistical equilibrium and the intensities of different evaporation residues are calculated applying hauser - feshbach formula in combination with the statistical nuclear model . in the present work ,",
    "the fusion cs was estimated considering the diffuseness parameter @xmath35l = 0.5 .",
    "the optical model potential parameters of willmore and hodgson were used for neutron transmission coefficients while the parameters of perey were used for proton transmission coefficients  @xcite . in order to check the dependence on the transmission coefficients ,",
    "the calculations were also performed considering the optical model potential parameters of becchetti and greenless  @xcite for neutron and proton decay .",
    "the results were very similar as obtained using the previous potentials .",
    "the @xmath4 decay was also considered in the calculation and was taken as 0.3 of the weiskoff unit for e1 decay .",
    "the level density prescription of reisdorf  @xcite was adopted for the calculations .",
    "the ( p , n ) and ( p,2n ) cs values obtained using cascade are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5-cs ] and  [ fig6-lncs ] with dot - dashed line .",
    "the ( p , n ) and ( p,2n ) cs are quite well reproduced except at higher energies where the calculation underestimates the ( p , n ) cs whereas overestimates the ( p,2n ) cs .",
    "no cs was obtained for ( p , p@xmath5n ) channel for all the incident proton energy .",
    "this could be due to the inherent problem of the cascade code in predicting low cs , as similar discrepancy is observed for ( p , n ) channel at higher proton energy in comparison to other models .      the alice/91  @xcite is a precompound and evaporation model code system for calculating the excitation functions and angular distribution of emitted particles in nuclear reactions .",
    "the model performs several types of calculations and combinations including a standard weisskopf - ewing evaporation  @xcite with multiple particle emission , s - wave approximation to give an upper limit to the enhancement of @xmath4 ray deexcitation due to angular momentum effects and an evaporation calculation that can include fission competition via the bohr - wheeler approach .",
    "alice91 calculates precompound decay via hybrid and geometry dependant hybrid model ( gdh )  @xcite with multiple precompound decay algorithms , single and double differential spectra , and reaction product cs . in this code , the beginning of any particle induced nuclear reaction is characterized by the configuration of the initially excited number of particles and holes , called as excitons .",
    "the excitons are described with respect to the ground state configuration of the compound system .",
    "the intermediate state of the system is defined by the excitation energy and the numbers of excitons .",
    "the binding energies and q - values were calculated by using the database of the experimental masses by wapstra and audi  @xcite wherever available and calculated from myers and swiatecki mass formula  @xcite , otherwise .",
    "the inverse cs were calculated using the optical model subroutine with the optical model parameters of becchetti and greenlees  @xcite .",
    "the level densities were calculated using the ignatyuk s formula  @xcite with the level density parameter a = a/9 mev@xmath36 , as the default option of the code .",
    "the present calculation reproduced the experimental data points quite well .",
    "however , the overprediction of the higher energy data points could be explained by the uncertainties in some of the parameters used in the code .      the nuclear reaction code empire ( version 3.1 rivoli ) , developed by herman _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , is a modular system of nuclear reaction codes .",
    "it comprises of different nuclear models and is designed to perform nuclear reaction calculations over a wide range of incident energies and projectiles .",
    "the code makes use of an improved version of the hauser - feshbach theory for the statistical part and the exciton model for the preequilibrium part of a nuclear reaction .",
    "different input parameters like nuclear masses , ground state deformations , discrete levels , @xmath4 ray strength functions , etc . were retrieved from the standard library ripl-3  @xcite included in the code .",
    "the particle transmission coefficients were calculated using the optical model routine ecis06  @xcite .",
    "the preequilibrium reactions with angular momentum conservation were considered using the code pcross , which can calculate nucleons , clusters and @xmath4 emission spectra in terms of the exciton model , based on the iwamoto - harada model  @xcite . the width fluctuation correction based on the hofmann , richert , tepel and weidenmuller ( hrtw ) model  @xcite",
    "was found to have almost no effect in the present calculations .",
    "the microscopic hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) level densities were taken from an internal file included in ripl-3 . in the present energy range",
    ", the calculation slightly overpredicts the experimental results in case of neutron evaporation reactions",
    ". however , the overall trend follows the experimental data points .",
    "the excitation functions for the p - induced reaction on the 97.65@xmath1 enriched @xmath0nd target were measured by @xmath4-decay spectroscopy following the stacked - foil activation technique . in the present work",
    ", the absolute cs for the reaction @xmath0nd(p , xnyp ) has been measured for the first time , following the use of the enriched @xmath0nd target .",
    "the present measurement also yields the first set of data points for these reaction cs at several proton energy values covering an energy range of 7 - 15 mev . in this work",
    "all sorts of precautions were taken to avoid the over or under estimation of reaction cs .",
    "apart from the use of an enriched target , the target enrichment as well as the nd : o ratio in the prepared target was considered for the calculation of the number of target nd atoms .",
    "the present work also involved the use of separate al - catcher foils of appropriate thickness corresponding to each target and monitor in order to ensure the complete collection of the recoiling evaporation residues .",
    "most importantly , the dead time of the detector was kept lower ( @xmath2110@xmath1 ) in the present work than that ( @xmath2140@xmath1 ) allowed in the work of lebeda _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "the abundances used for the @xmath4 transitions were also corrected for the appropriate conversion as per their multipolarity . wherever possible , the obtained cs values were cross checked by using the activities from two different @xmath4 transitions .",
    "the cs values at several proton energies were calculated from two different measurements by making appropriate target stacks as explained in section  [ expt ] in order to ensure the correctness of our experimental data in the present work .",
    "the excitation functions for the neutron evaporation residues , obtained from the present work , were found to follow the expected trend in the present range of proton energy .",
    "the @xmath9nd was populated through both ( p , p@xmath5n ) and ( p , d ) channels whose individual contribution could not be deciphered in the present experiment .",
    "similarly , the production of @xmath9pm has a contribution from the decay of @xmath9nd .",
    "however , this has been observed to be very negligible compared to the production of @xmath9pm from the ( p , 2n ) reaction channel .",
    "the above observation is further supported by the low cs values obtained for @xmath9nd in the present work .",
    "the theoretical calculations for the excitation functions have been performed with different statistical model codes , _ viz .",
    ", _ cascade , alice and empire3.1 .",
    "both the experimental data and theoretical calculations exhibited reasonably similar trend in the entire proton energy range .",
    "the cs values , obtained from the work of lebeda _ et al . , _",
    "@xcite , were scaled up to the absolute values by considering the isotopic enrichment ratio of nd .",
    "these reconstructed values are higher compared to the absolute cs measured in the present work .",
    "it is obvious that both the absolute cs values directly obtained from the present experiment and the cs values reconstructed from the work by lebeda _",
    "et al . , _ show a reasonable similarity to that predicted by the theoretical models .",
    "however , the extent of closeness between these two sets of experimental cs values with the theoretical predictions is different .",
    "this might be due to the combination of several unknown experimental conditions involved in a multi - step measurement procedure .",
    "again , the theoretical calculations , involving hosts of uncertainties in the large number of input parameters , are necessarily capable of reproducing the overall trend of the excitation function .",

    "<S> excitation functions were measured by stacked - foil activation technique for the @xmath0nd(p , xpyn ) reaction using 97.65@xmath1 enriched @xmath0nd target . </S>",
    "<S> measurement up to @xmath250@xmath1 above barrier and down to 18@xmath1 below the barrier was performed using proton beam energy ( e@xmath3 ) of 7 - 15 mev from vecc cyclotron . </S>",
    "<S> the yield of suitable @xmath4 rays emitted following the decay of relevant evaporation residues was determined using a 50@xmath1 high purity germanium ( hpge ) detector.(p , n ) cross section was found to follow the expected trend with a maximum value of 63.7(4.9)mb at e@xmath3 @xmath2 8.6 mev . </S>",
    "<S> ( p,2n ) cross section gradually increased with e@xmath3 and had maximum contribution to the total reaction cross section after e@xmath3 @xmath2 9.0 mev . </S>",
    "<S> ( p , p@xmath5n ) reaction channel also showed a reasonable yield with a threshold of e@xmath3 @xmath2 12.0 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental data were corroborated with statistical model calculations using different codes , viz . , cascade , alice/91 and empire3.1 . </S>",
    "<S> all the calculations using a suitable set of global parameters could reproduce the excitation function fairly well in the present energy range . </S>"
