    "the above expression appears as a generalized convolution of two dynamic quantities .",
    "one is some distribution function @xmath13 of a nucleon in a target while the second element is the structure function of a nucleon .",
    "those components refer , respectively , to a system of point - nucleons in a nucleus without reference to quarks , and to the structure function of a nucleon composed of quarks , without a trace that the former is part of a nucleus .",
    "differently stated , the expression ( 1 ) seems to be compatible with the dynamics of a cluster model with independent degrees of freedom for quarks in a nucleon and nucleons in a nucleus .",
    "it is then natural to exploit a cluster model for a study of the emc effect , not only in the pwia ( essentially the @xmath10 limit ) , but also for general , finite @xmath14 .",
    "this implies retention of final state interactions ( fsi ) which in principle involve ( hadronized ) quarks , gluons , etc . of course",
    ", without introducing drastic simplifications , there is little hope for a realistic treatment .    in the following",
    "we shall formulate the simplest conceivable model , namely a non - relativistic ( nr ) quark cluster model , which shall provide a formally exact expression for @xmath8 .",
    "it also permits proper handling of a recurring off - shell problem , encountered in realistic approaches . in the end",
    "we suggest an extension of the model to the relativistic regime .",
    "consider 3@xmath15 spin-0 quarks of equal charge , with triplets clustering in bags .",
    "no details will be required regarding the dynamics of quarks inside one bag . in contrast",
    "one has to be specific about the interaction between quarks belonging to different bags . instead of those",
    ", we consider the total interactions between two triplets of quarks .",
    "those we replace by an effective , @xmath16optical@xmath17 potential , acting between the centers of the bags , thereby violating in part the pauli principle .",
    "the above potential ought to be complex and energy - dependent but we simply take it to be real and energy - independent .",
    "rather than seeking justification for a cluster model ( bag excitation energies which much exceed those of a nucleus , etc . )",

    "the spectrum of confined quarks is discrete , while nuclear states @xmath35 may belong to either discrete or to continuum parts of a spectrum .",
    "the form of the charge - density operator in ( [ a3 ] ) permits a separate treatment of parts related to , respectively nucleons in a nucleus and quarks in a nucleon .",
    "we start with a remark on the latter .",
    "although a free nucleon , at rest or moving , is always on its energy shell , a constituent one in a nuclear medium has a non - vanishing momentum @xmath36 and is generally off - shell with @xmath37 . limiting ourselves to the case of an on - shell recoiling nucleon with momentum @xmath38 , we have the general expression    [ a4 ] @xmath39    eq .",
    "( [ a4b ] ) shows that one can express a nr structure function for a moving target with off - shell kinematics in terms of the same for an on - shell target at rest @xmath40 by a mere shift in the energy argument .",

    "we emphasize that eqs .",
    "( [ a6 ] ) and ( [ a10 ] ) are formally exact expressions for the desired response in the cluster model and are valid not only asymptotically , but for any finite @xmath9 .",
    "they have the form of a convolution , involving on equal footing nucleon and nuclear responses @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "separability of degrees of freedom in a nr model is clearly a sufficient , and quite likely a necessary condition for the emergence of a convolution .",
    "molecules at low @xmath55 . in the born - oppenheimer",
    "there is nearly perfect separation of degrees of freedom for translations of the centers of molecules and of rotations for frozen electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom .",
    "the total response is consequently a convolution @xcite . ]",

    "the function @xmath70 in ( [ a13b ] ) is the single - particle spectral function in terms of the separation energy @xmath71 of a nucleon when removed from the target ground state , and leaving the core with excitation energy @xmath72 .",
    "after substitution of ( [ a13b ] ) into ( [ a11 ] ) , the integrations of the latter over @xmath72 , respectively @xmath73 result in    [ a15 ] @xmath74    where the upper and lower limits @xmath75 on the @xmath72-integral are determined by the integration over @xmath73 in ( [ a11])@xcite .",
    "we now discuss the above results in some detail and start with ( [ a15b ] ) .",
    "comparison with ( [ a4 ] ) shows that the energy argument of @xmath76 in ( [ a15b ] ) corresponds to a nucleon with momentum @xmath36 and apparent off - shell energy @xmath77 we now recall that in the pwia , core and knocked - out nucleon are by definition on their respective energy shells ( see fig .",

    "the argument of the @xmath78-function in ( [ a13b ] ) reflects over - all energy conservation in the pwia and implies that the core excitation energy @xmath72 equals the missing energy @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "the integration over the momentum of the knocked - out proton @xmath36 in ( [ a15a ] ) extends only over the nuclear component and the form in brackets there ( the integrated semi - inclusive response ) is the inclusive nuclear response in the pwia .",

    "its identity with ( [ a32b ] ) is established by means of the following relativistic analog of ( [ a23 ] ) @xmath125 incidentally , in view of ( [ a30 ] ) and the relative smallness of the recoil kinetic energy of the core in ( [ a28 ] ) , the dependence of the integrand in ( [ a32b ] ) on @xmath126 resides in practice only in @xmath123 .",
    "we have discussed above a non - relativistic quark - cluster model with triplets of spin-0 quarks , confined to bags , which amongst them interact by means of effective nucleon - nucleon forces .",
    "in such a model one shows that , for arbitrary @xmath9 , the total nuclear response @xmath127 is a convolution of responses for a nucleus made up of point - nucleons and for a nucleon bag . with no manifest reference to the underlying potential model we postulated an extension into the relativistic regime . the result eq .",
    "( [ a26 ] ) formally contains the full nuclear interaction in @xmath113 , i.e. incorporates final state interactions between the core and the nucleon and which by definition is neglected in the pwia .",
    "moreover , separated nucleonic and sub - nucleonic degrees of freedom clearly leave no room for rescaling or swelling of nucleons as a result of embedding in a nucleus .",
    "the above - mentioned effective nucleon - nucleon forces can not by construction describe a detailed interaction of quarks in different nucleons , but only their global effect . for example interactions there between the di - quark and of the recoiling quark debris with a given core nucleon are parts of an effective @xmath128 interaction . in the above restricted sense @xmath129 in the model result ( [ a26 ] ) formally contains all final state interaction contributions ( @xmath16 higher order twist@xmath16 ) .",
    "a sufficient condition for ( [ a26 ] ) to hold is separability of sub - hadronic from nuclear degrees of freedom .",
    "it is also calculable in principle .",
    "there actually is no need to specify the dynamics of the constituents , or even to be explicit about their nature and the hard portion of the total structure function @xmath121 can be taken from data . in contradistinction",
    "the soft part of the total structure function @xmath129 is presently not accessible @xcite and one needs explicit nuclear dynamics for an actual calculation .    a model with extreme simplifications",
    "as the one discussed above obviously misses essentials of a relativistic description of inclusive scattering from a nucleus . for one ,",
    "spin effects complicate a simple convolution of the form ( [ a26 ] ) .",
    "we now discuss two basic elements which enable an evaluation of @xmath8 , namely quark clustering in nucleon bags and their mutual interaction .",
    "the latter leads to fsi between the core and nucleon debris , independent of the state of excitation or hadronization .",
    "essentially the same assumptions have been made in far more sophisticated approaches , where triplets of quarks in mit bags couple to mesons @xcite .",
    "those couplings induce effective interactions between bags or nucleons , mediated by the exchange of the same mesons . clearly",
    "the notion of bags in a larger assembly of quarks is tantamount to clustering , while @xmath130 couplings induce effective @xmath128 interactions mediated by the same mesons .",
    "also in an application of that model to the total nuclear structure function , again only the bag ground state appears involved @xcite .",
    "as in the quark cluster model , the @xmath130 coupling model completely disregards the state of excitation of the bag .    in the work by melnitchouk @xmath131",
    "one can find another attempt to go beyond the pwia , in case by estimating the fsi between the di - quark debris of the struck nucleon and the core .",
    "we already remarked that in a cluster model the effective @xmath128 interaction combines the interaction of a core nucleon with the debris of the struck nucleon , i.e. a di - quark @xmath132 the recoiling quark .",
    "in summary we discussed a quark cluster model which provides answers on some cogent questions , relevant for a treatment of the emc effect .",
    "it is certainly of interest to see those questions addressed and handled in more sophisticated theories .",
