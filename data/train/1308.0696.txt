    "it is important to take into account the considerable red - shift of the direct bandgap as the temperature increases @xcite .",
    "we have therefore performed time and polarization resolved photoluminescence excitation ( ple ) experiments , see figure [ fig : fig3 ] , to vary the initially generated polarization p@xmath41 .",
    "the time - integrated pl is detected at its peak energy ( 1.867 ev and 1.828 ev at t=4 k and 300 k respectively ) . as already observed by different groups @xcite the pl circular polarization degree and thus the valley initialization decrease at t=4",

    "though the polarization minimum is observed roughly in the region where the b - exciton is photogenerated ( see the vertical dotted line ) , its origin needs further clarification since the b - exciton absorbs and emits the same light helicity as the a - exciton in a given k valley @xcite .",
    "the energetically close lying indirect transition from the @xmath47 valley valence band to the conduction band , which is unpolarized , could play a role @xcite . when comparing results obtained on different samples in the literature @xcite , it is important to take into account the laser excitation ( power , pulsed or cw ) and the exact form of the emission spectrum , see section[sec : supp ] .",

    "we perform the same ple experiments as in figure [ fig : fig3]a , but at room temperature . when the laser is far from resonance , we observe close to zero polarization .",
    "remarkably , as we lower the laser energy and become more and more resonant , the polarization drastically increases , in the same manner as at 4k .",
    "for the closest energy to resonance that was achievable in practice with our set - up ( filter cut - off for stray laser light ) , we measure an emission polarization of @xmath48 , close to the maximum observed at 4k of @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "this is very encouraging as optical initialization of valley polarization with a suitable excitation source can therefore be very efficient even at room temperature . here",
    "it would be extremely useful to investigate how the strong coulomb interaction @xcite influences the polarization at 300k .",
    "the few time resolved measurements reported in the literature for 1ml mos@xmath0 use highly non - resonant excitation and did not analyse the polarization of the emission @xcite . in @xcite and @xcite",
    "the authors suggest that non - radiative recombination of the excitons could explain the first , short decay observed from 4k to 300k .",
    "we can infer from our time and polarization resolved measurements that the detected polarization in time - integrated experiments is due to the emission during this short time window .",
    "if this initial decay is indeed limited by non - radiative processes or an intrinsic exciton lifetime is still an open question .",
    "the exciton binding energy is estimated to be in the hundreds of mev range @xcite .",
    "systems with large exciton binding energies such as organic films and carbon nanotubes have intrinsic exciton radiative lifetimes on the order of a few ps @xcite . in our measurements",
    "the pl decay time @xmath14 does not change with temperature within our time resolution , we do not observe any activation or any other typical signature of non - radiative processes .",
    "for comparison , for high quality gaas quantum well structures the free wannier - exciton radiative recombination time increases with temperature @xcite .",
    "an argument in favour of a radiative exciton decay within a few ps comes from the observation of the b - exciton emission , 150mev higher in energy than the a - exciton @xcite , as radiative recombination of the b - exciton is in competition with non - radiative decay and relaxation to the a - exciton . here a theoretical prediction of the intrinsic exciton recombination is needed to guide future experiments in this promising system . + in the future also the influence of the substrate on the polarization dynamics needs to be investigated .",
    "here we used mos@xmath0 mls on sio@xmath0 , the most practical substrate for ( opto-)electronic devices .",
    "although time resolved experiments on suspended mos@xmath0 mls gave similar time - resolved absorption results to experiments using substrates @xcite , a comparison with mos@xmath0 on bn where the localised exciton emission was suppressed @xcite would be important to clarify the nature of the observed pl emission .",
    "+ the very fast exciton decay time measured here in mos@xmath0 mls could help explaining several key observations : ( i ) application of a transverse magnetic fields will only shown an influence on the polarization of the ml pl if the precession time is shorter than 4ps @xcite .",
