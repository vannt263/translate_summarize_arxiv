    "in recent years , the association between low redshift quasars and galaxies has been placed on firm observational grounds .",
    "hst and ground  based surveys have shown that most , if not all , the @xmath17 qsos lie in host galaxy that often show clear sign of morphological distortions and are preferentially located in overdense environments ( see e.g. bahcall et al 1997 and references therein ) , suggesting that the qso activity and evolution at low and intermediate redshifts are driven by interaction between galaxies ( barnes and hernquist 1991 ; cavaliere and vittorini 1998 ) .",
    "the qso evolution at @xmath18 is expected to be more closely related to the formation of massive galaxies in overdense regions ( haenelt and rees 1991 ) , and high redshift qsos have long been thought to mark preferential site of galaxy formation .",
    "now that viable techniques for the selection of star  forming galaxies at @xmath19 have been envisaged ( steidel et al 1995 , 1996 ; madau 1995 , lanzetta , yahil , fernandez  soto 1996 ; giallongo et al 1996 ; hu and mcmahon 1996 ) , the connection between qso activity and early galaxy formation may be investigated directly at these high @xmath15 .",
    "few examples of emitting objects have already been found around @xmath20 qsos ( pascarelle et al 1996 , warren and mller 1996 ) , although eimitting companions are not common around radio quiet qsos ( hu et al 1991 ) .    among the highest redshift qsos ,",
    "several investigations have recently been focused on the radio  quiet br1202 - 0725 ( mcmahon et al 1994 ) , at an estimated redshift of 4.694 ( storrie - lombardi et al .",
    "fontana et al ( 1996 , hereafter fcdgs ) carried out a deep photometric study of the field around the qso in the b , v , gunn@xmath21 and i bands .",
    "they detected a clearly distinct nebulous object ( hereafter referred to as br1202 - 07 b ) of i magnitude @xmath22 , located 2.2 arcsec nw of the qso .",
    "they concluded that its colors can be reconciled only with a galaxy at @xmath23 where star formation has been going on for less than @xmath24 yr , and derived a star formation rate @xmath25 m@xmath13 yr@xmath6 ( for a imf with slope @xmath26 and solar metallicity ) .    a strong ly@xmath27 emission from this object at the same redshift as the qso has been detected in narrow band imaging by hu et al .",
    "( 1996a ) and in imaging spectroscopy by petitjean et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . as shown by petitjean et al ( 1996 ) ,",
    "these results imply that the object can be either a starburst proto  galaxy or a nebular cloud photoionized by the qso where part of the continuum is due to the reflection of the qso light by dust .",
    "excess millimeter and submillimeter emission consistent with dust has been detected from this quasar ( isaak et al 1994 ; mcmahon et al .",
    "1994 ) , and more recently , co emission at @xmath0 has been found close to the quasar and the companion ( omont et al 1996 ) . in the light of this new evidence hu et al ( 1996b )",
    "hint that most likely br1202- 07b is a neighboring galaxy merging with the qso host galaxy and producing enough extended gas to form a companion ionized by the qso .",
    "we present here a new spectrum of the companion to br1202 - 0725 in the range @xmath28 and use it to rediscuss the different hypothesis on the nature of this object .",
    "the imager - spectrograph emmi at the eso ",
    "ntt was used remotely from garching with eso grism # 1 to obtain 4 exposure ( 1h each ) during two clear nights on january 29 - 31 , 1996 , with the seeing varying from 0.7 to 1.1 arcsec fwhm .",
    "the ccd was binned @xmath29 in the direction of the dispersion giving a scale of 5.7  /pixel and 0.27/pixel in the direction of the dispersion and perpendicular to it , respectively .",
    "the long slit of 1.5  width was centered on the qso at a pa of @xmath30 .",
    "observations of the standard star feige 67 were obtained on both nights in the same configuration .",
    "the most straightforward data reduction steps ( bias removal , flat  fielding , cosmic ray detection and flagging , wavelength calibration ) were performed with the standard midas facilities .",
    "the spectral resolution as measured from the argon lines of the calibration lamp is 15     at 7200   .",
    "we have developed a specific software to perform the most critical issue in the data reduction , which is the subtraction of the contribution of the underlying spectrum of qso from the one of the galaxy .",
    "after several tests , the psf of the qso has been fitted only on the side where the companion is located ( i.e. northwest ) as the sum of a gaussian and of lorentian function .",
    "most of their parameter ( namely @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , the common center and the ratio of their intensity ) were allowed to vary smoothly along the dispersion to follow the variation of the psf with wavelength .",
    "the other free parameters ( i.e. the sky level and the qso intensity ) were simultaneously obtained by @xmath34 minimization at each ccd column ( i.e. in the direction orthogonal to the dispersion ) .",
    "the pixels contaminated by the emission from the companion were not used in the fitting process .",
    "this procedure was verified to remove satisfactorily the qso tail on the other side ( i.e. southeast ) of the qso , at the distance corresponding to br1202 - 07b .",
    "this procedure was repeated on each frame , and the qso  subtracted 2d frames were then wavelength calibrated and summed .",
    "finally , the spectrum was extracted with a 1.65 \" wide window , starting at a distance of 1.1  from the qso ( the highest resolution image by fcdgs shows that the resulting aperture of @xmath35@xmath36  does encompass the bulk of both the continuum and emission line regions ) , flux calibrated and extinction  corrected .",
    "the main source of uncertainity in the continuum level comes from the accuracy of the qso subtraction .",
    "we estimate that for the uncertainity in the continuum flux is @xmath37 .",
    "figure 1 shows the flux calibrated spectrum of 1202 - 07b .",
    "the most prominent feature is the emission line centered at 6932   , corresponding to a redshift @xmath3 .",
    "the measured fwhm is 28.8    ( @xmath38 km s@xmath6 ) , corresponding to 24.6    ( @xmath39 km s@xmath6 ) when the instrumental resolution is quadratically subtracted .",
    "we measure an integrated ly @xmath27 flux from br1202 - 07b of @xmath4ergs @xmath5s@xmath6 , in agreement with the fcdgs estimate from photometric data and with hu et al 1996a and petitjean et al 1996    at the expected position of the civ@xmath8 , no emission line is detected above the noise level .",
    "the resulting @xmath9 upper limit on the integrated flux is @xmath40ergs @xmath5s@xmath6 , assuming the same fwhm of the emission line .",
    "although the upper limit for the civ emission line does not exclude the presence of a faint agn , it is about @xmath41 times lower than the flux needed to explain the i band flux in the nebular emission model ( see fig . 4 of petitjean et al 1996 ) .",
    "furthermore , the observed continuum level of @xmath42ergs @xmath5s@xmath6 @xmath6 is consistent with that expected for the spectrum of a star  forming galaxy with @xmath22 ( see fcdgs , figure 2 ) . in the next section",
    "we ll show that these results imply that the continuum emission from br1202 - 07b is the result of a star  forming activity and not the nebular reprocessing of the qso emissivity .",
    "a close scrutiny of the emission from br1202 - 07b reveals other interesting clues on the nature of this object .",
    "2 shows the 2-d emission after subtraction of the qso .",
    "both the raw pixels and the superimposed contours levels suggest that the emission is structured .",
    "first of all , a tail of emission extends toward the qso , as shown also in high resolution narrow  band images ( hu et al 1996b ) .",
    "furthermore , the 2-d shape of the central emission appears to be `` tilted '' , with larger velocity shifts with respect to the qso systemic velocity at increasing distances from the qso . in an attempt to quantify this effect , we have computed , at each velocity bin , the distance of the peak of the emission , by fitting a 1-d gaussian to any column : the line connecting these points is also shown in fig 2 .    although the s / n and the spectral and spatial resolution are limited , we note that this tilt , that is detected in each single exposure , and clearer in those with better seeing , is not likely to arise from a poor qso subtraction .",
    "the total integrated flux of the qso tail is indeed about 20% of the flux , and we estimate that the uncertainity on its subtraction is reduced to few percent of the flux .",
    "we further note that since the emission from the qso is very broad , and does nt change appreciably in intensity in the wavelength range shown in fig 2 ( see also fig2 of petitjean et 1996 ) , its subtraction can not result in the asymmetric shape shown in fig .",
    "2 , as well as in the extension of the emission toward the qso .",
    "finally , the tilt is fairly insensitive to the different procedures of qso subtraction that we tested .",
    "the most straightforward interpretation of the spectrum of br1202 - 07b is that the uv continuum is produced by intense star formation at @xmath0 .",
    "we have converted the observed flux ( as obtained from the i magnitude m@xmath43 = 24.1 ) into sfr using the latest version of the bruzual and charlot evolutionary models ( bruzual and charlot 1998 ) , that allow for different imf and metallicities .",
    "the values obtained range from 15 ( 47 ) m@xmath13 yr@xmath6 for a salpeter imf with low metallicity @xmath44 to 46 ( 144 ) m@xmath13 yr@xmath6 for a scalo imf with solar metallicity , in a @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) universe with @xmath47 km s@xmath6mpc@xmath6 . as discussed by fcdgs , the k band detection places stringent constraints on the age of the stellar population , which can not be larger than @xmath48 yr , regardless of metallicity and imf .",
    "the emission in starburst galaxies is less straightforward to compute , since it depends on geometrical effects and dust extinction .",
    "the total integrated emission of @xmath49 erg s@xmath6 is about twice what expected from scaling the charlot and fall ( 1991 ) computation of the emission to the observed sfr , in the case of a salpeter imf with solar metallicity .    due to the proximity of the qso , indeed , part or most of the observed emission might result from nebular reprocessing of the qso ionizing flux .",
    "as shown by petitjean et al 1996 , the nebular spectrum is dominated by line emission , and a model can be envisaged where all the photometric properties can be ascribed to the coincidence of , civ and oii emission lines in the @xmath21 , i and k band respectively .",
    "however , the civ equivalent width is expected to be even larger than the one to compensate for the low efficiency of the i filter at the corresponding wavelength , so that a 90% depression of the flux is required in this case .",
    "the upper limit on the civ emission line and the detection of the continuum in the optical spectrum allow to reject this model with a high degree of confidence .    finally , the flat observed @xmath50 ( that samples the rest ",
    "frame spectral shape between 1500     and 4000   ) of br1202 - 07b argues against a contribution from the reflection of the qso continuum on the dusty co - emitting companion ( omont et al 1996 ) .",
    "indeed , the qso is much redder than its companion ( @xmath51 ) , and a further reddening of about @xmath52 magnitude is expected from the albedo curve of dust , as computed under standard assumptions for graphite  free grains ( pei 1992 ) .",
    "while the continuum reflects intense star formation activity , the qso may be the dominant source of ionizing flux that is responsible for the emission . following warren and mller ( 1996 ) , indeed",
    ", we obtain that the distance from the ionizing source is of the order of @xmath53kpc , well within the range allowed by the geometry of the system ( @xmath54 kpc are the minimum distance possible given the 2.2 \" separation , @xmath55  kpc is the distance obtained if the redshift difference is taken as cosmological ) .    in conclusion ,",
    "the observed spectral properties of the companion to br1202 - 0725 are consistent only with a burst of star formation at @xmath0 , with the nearby quasar possibly providing an extra source of ionization .",
    "the observed 2d velocity profile of the @xmath27 emitter is an indication that the dynamical state of the emitting gas is out of equilibrium , and that gravitational infall or tidal interaction may be occurring in this object .",
    "the extension toward the qso of the emission may imply infall toward the qso host , if the galaxy is physically located in front of the qso , and infalling toward it , that would result in the larger redshift measured .",
    "otherwise , the companion galaxy is located beyond the qso and receiding from it : in this case , a close interaction might have recently occurred between the two objects , leading to the burst of star formation in the companion and to a fuelling of the qso central black hole ( heahnelt and rees 1993 , lake , katz and moore 1998 ) .",
    "the extension of the ly@xmath27 emission toward the qso may be a relic of this interaction .",
    "however , some caution must be taken in drawing these conclusions since the emission line in the steidel s sample of @xmath56 galaxies is - when detected - generally redshifted by up to several hundred relative to the interstellar absorption lines ( pettini et al 1997 ) .",
    "if we assume that the observed tilt in the 2d emission comes from bulk motion on kpc scale within the emitting gas , the internal velocity range ( @xmath57 km s@xmath6 , see fig .",
    "2 ) is rather large for rotationally supported disks , but arises naturally during collapse and merging of pre  galactic clumps on a central potential ( haehnelt , steinmetz and rauch 1997 ) .",
    "thus , br120207b appears to be the highest redshift counterpart of other emitting galaxies found in the environment of high @xmath15 qsos ( e.g. steidel et al 1991 , warren and mller 1996 ) .",
    "in addition to it , other objects are detected in the environment of the qso .",
    "a fainter galaxy companion is also detected sw of the qso in the @xmath58 frame from hst , and recently confirmed to be a and[oii ] emitter at @xmath0 ( hu et al 1996b ) . a co emitting object (",
    "omont et al 1996 ) is detected at a different redshift @xmath59 than the emission , corresponding to @xmath60 , and is aligned with br1202 - 07b and with the qso itself .",
    "their alignment is consistent with recent models of galaxy formation , that show that structure formation and merging occurs along 1d or 2d structures ( `` filaments '' ) , a feature common to other qso companions at high redshift ( mller and warren 1997 and references therein ) .",
    "all this evidence show that we are detecting a high redshift galaxy still far from the dynamical equilibrium , and with a high star ",
    "formation rate in the individual pre  galactic components .",
    "it remains to be assessed whether this situation is typical of @xmath61 quasar . at @xmath22 , the rest ",
    "frame uv luminosity of br1202 - 07b is @xmath62 erg s@xmath6 @xmath6 ( for @xmath63 ) , about 2.35 times brighter than the `` average '' lyman - break galaxy at @xmath56 ( pettini et al 1997 ) .",
    "the case of br1202 - 07b , where the star  formation activity has been identified from its broad  band colors , shows that multicolor surveys as deep as @xmath64 and @xmath65 and with excellent image quality are required to investigate the environment of high@xmath15 qsos and to test the cosmological scenario where qso activity at high @xmath15 is directly related to the early stages of galaxy formation .",
