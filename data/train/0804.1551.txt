    "experimental investigations of wave chaotic phenomena in three dimensions can be performed with microwave resonators@xcite and acoustic blocks  @xcite .",
    "the resonance spectra investigated in such experiments are described by non - scalar wave equations and are considerably more complicated than the quantum mechanical wave equations of a non - integrable hamiltonian system with three degrees of freedom .",
    "let us briefly review the ( relatively short ) list of studies of quantum chaos in three - dimensional billiards .",
    "prosen investigated quantum chaotic phenomena in a three - dimensional deformed sphere @xcite .",
    "primack and smilansky  @xcite unraveled the classical and quantum mechanics of the three - dimensional sinai billiard  @xcite , and verified the applicability of gutzwiller s trace formula  @xcite ; a corresponding experimental study of a microwave resonator was presented in ref .",
    "the experimental study  @xcite of the three - dimensional bunimovich stadium led to a verification of the trace formula proposed by balian and duplantier @xcite for electromagnetic systems .",
    "a self - bound three - body system with high - dimensional scars was studied theoretically in ref .",
    "problems involving mode coupling in three - dimensional systems were investigated in vibrating crystals  @xcite and also in a microwave resonator @xcite .",
    "the theoretical description of quantum chaos in three - dimensional systems is in general very difficult . a full understanding of the classical dynamics is compounded by the difficulty to visualize motion in phase space .",
    "moreover , the analysis of level statistics of the corresponding quantum system requires the accurate computation of long level sequences and can be a very time - consuming task for eigenstates with short wave lengths .",
    "furthermore , there are a number of open questions .",
    "these concern , for instance , the applicability and accuracy of semiclassical periodic orbit sums for the quantization of such systems .",
    "this problem was addressed by primack and smilansky in their study of the three - dimensional sinai billiard  @xcite , which is completely chaotic . yet",
    ", an infinite number of families of marginally stable ( bouncing ball ) orbits considerably complicates the semiclassical computation of the level density in terms of gutzwiller s trace formula .",

    "the applicability of this periodic orbit sum was recently investigated and confirmed for a three - dimensional stadium billiard with chaotic dynamics @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of the present work to study the quantum mechanical aspects of the three - dimensional stadium billiard further .",

    "first , the classical dynamics is strongly chaotic and no stable islands are known for @xmath2 . in this work , we focus particularly on the case @xmath3 since this geometry was studied in microwave experiments @xcite and in ref .",
    "the ratio was chosen irrational in order to avoid nongeneric quantum effects due to classical orbits of measure zero ( see below ) .",
    "second , nongeneric contributions to the level density arise due to two families of bouncing - ball orbits . however , unlike in the case of the three - dimensional sinai billiard  @xcite , their contribution can be computed and subtracted .",
    "third , for @xmath4 the billiard exhibits a high symmetry ( under reflection at the @xmath1 plane with a subsequent rotation around the @xmath5-axis about @xmath6 degrees ) , and this offers the opportunity to study symmetry - breaking effects .",
    "below , we will see that the level statistics in this highly symmetric case exhibit a deviation from the theoretical prediction for chaotic systems .",
    "this led to the discovery of a stable and a few marginally stable orbits which were previously unknown .",

    "some technical aspects concerning the finite element approximation with web - splines are deferred to the appendix .",
    "in this section we investigate nongeneric modes and classical periodic orbits .",
    "the former are an interesting , system - specific property and must be subtracted from the staircase function before generic properties can be analyzed ; the latter are useful in a semiclassical interpretation of quantum spectra .",

    "the dynamics is limited to @xmath7 and @xmath8 with specular reflections at the planes @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "we use @xmath11 and will express lengths in units of @xmath12 and wave momenta in units of @xmath13 . for @xmath2 ,",
    "the billiard is fully desymmetrized ; for @xmath4 , it is still symmetric under reflection at the plane @xmath1 and a subsequent rotation by @xmath14 around the @xmath5-axis .",
    "we label eigenstates by their wave momentum @xmath15 . employing a recently developed method which is based on finite elements and seeks solutions of the schrdinger equation with dirichlet boundary conditions , we computed the lowest 1200 levels up to @xmath16 .",
    "more details on this method are given in the appendix .",

    "there are two families of bouncing - ball orbits which bounce back and forth between the two parallel planes of distance @xmath27 and @xmath12 in the two quarter cylinders , respectively .",
    "these orbits are marginally stable as they have zero lyapunov exponents . according to semiclassical periodic orbit theory ,",
    "they are associated with long - range oscillations of the quantum mechanical density of states .",
    "we follow ref .",
    "@xcite for the computation of the contribution of bouncing - ball orbits to the staircase function , and focus on the bouncing - ball modes in the upper quarter cylinder first .",
    "the number of bouncing - ball ( bb ) modes up to momentum @xmath15 is given by [ nbb ] n_bb(k ) & = & tr_bb ( ^2k^22m- ) + & = & _ = 1^ + & & ( k^2 - k_z^2 -k_y^2- k_x,^2 ) + & + & ( ( x , y)(y , x ) )  .",

    "@xcite . as evident from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the bouncing - ball orbits ( dashed line ) describe the gross oscillations of the fluctuating staircase function rather well . to account for finer details , we also have to consider nongeneric modes inside the @xmath1 plane .",
    "the rectangular @xmath1 plane is special , since the classical motion is regular inside this plane but unstable with respect to deviations out of this plane .",
    "note that this does not spoil the hyperbolicity of the billiard since the set of orbits restricted to the @xmath1 plane are of measure zero in classical phase space .",
    "however , remnants of families of classical orbits inside this plane can also be associated with long - range fluctuations in the quantum mechanical level density for the following two reasons .",
    "first , the periodic orbits inside this plane come in two - dimensional families opposed to the isolated periodic orbits in hyperbolic systems .",
    "second , these orbits are less unstable than most truly three - dimensional periodic orbits and thus enter any periodic - orbit sum with a greater weight .",
    "it is thus necessary to include the nongeneric modes associated with the @xmath1 plane .    extending the results from ref",
    "@xcite , the number of modes associated with nongeneric orbits is given by the quantum mechanical trace over nongeneric ( ng ) modes [ nng ] n_ng(k ) & = & tr_ng ( ^2k^22m- ) + & = & _ , = 1^ ( k^2 - k_z^2 - k_x,^2 - k_y,^2 )  .",
    "this ansatz is again transparent : the trace is approximated by a phase - space integral in the @xmath5-direction , while the rectangular sections ( with @xmath5-dependent area ) perpendicular to the @xmath5-axis are explicitly quantized .",

    "following gutzwiller s periodic orbit theory  @xcite , the semiclassical approximation of the quantum mechanical density of states is given in terms of the periodic orbits of the underlying classical system .",
    "this sum is infinite such that approximations have to be invoked . here",
    ", we are interested in the length spectrum , i.e. the power spectrum of the fourier transform of the fluctuating part of the level density .",
    "the length spectrum up to length @xmath41 is given in terms of all periodic orbits up to length @xmath41 , and this is a finite ( but usually with @xmath41 exponentially increasing ) number of periodic orbits .",
    "the search for periodic orbits is a cumbersome task . here , we use two different methods and focus on periodic orbits outside the @xmath1 plane .",
    "the first method considers the poincar surface of section ( psos ) defined by @xmath42 , and constructs the psos map .",
    "periodic orbits are fixed points of this map .",
    "they are found by starting a large number of trajectories in the psos and by using a newton - raphson algorithm to find fixed points in the vicinity of each such trajectory .",
    "the second method is based on a symbolic code and utilizes the fact that the length of a periodic orbit is a local extremum under variation of the points of reflection along the billiard s boundary .",
    "this procedure is similar to the one described in ref .",
    "we consider an open billiard system which is the infinite periodic extension of our billiard , and assign the letters `` + '' and `` - '' to reflections on the curved parts of the upper and lower quarter cylinder , respectively .",
    "periodic orbits outside the @xmath1 plane can certainly be described as words composed from these two letters .",
    "we have no proof that there is a one - to - one correspondence between this symbolic code and the periodic orbits of our system . given a word from this alphabet , we construct a random closed orbit as follows . for each `` + '' ( `` - '' ) letter of the word , we choose a random point on the curved surface of the upper ( lower ) quarter cylinder .",
    "we connect this sequence of points by straight lines and compute the length of this closed orbit .",
    "then we vary the positions of the random points in order to find a local minimum of the length .",
    "both methods yield a considerable number of periodic orbits , and we consider the union of the resulting sets as our set of periodic orbits .",
    "once a periodic orbit is found , we compute its length , monodromy matrix and its maslov index following ref .",
    "recall that the monodromy matrix is the tangent map and encodes the stability properties of the periodic orbit .",
    "for unstable orbits , its eigenvalues come in real pairs @xmath43 with @xmath44 or in complex quadruples @xmath45 with @xmath44 .",
    "stable orbits have two pairs of complex eigenvalues with modulus one .",
    "we performed our most extensive search for the billiard with the geometry @xmath3 and determined more than 2000 periodic orbits .",
    "we believe that our list is fairly complete for the shortest orbits .",
    "all periodic obits we found were unstable .",
    "this extends and confirms the numerical results of ref .",
    "@xcite and strongly suggests that the billiard is completely chaotic .",
    "the quantum mechanical results presented below support this picture .",
    "the contribution of the unstable periodic orbits to the length spectrum is shown in the upper part of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] as a dashed line .",
    "clearly , unstable periodic orbits contribute significantly to the length spectrum , particularly for length @xmath46 where the contributions from nongeneric modes become less dominant .",
    "however , for the case @xmath4 we found a stable periodic orbit .",
    "this was unexpected , since earlier studies  @xcite yielded a positive lyapunov exponent for a sample of @xmath47 randomly chosen trajectories , and not one of the trajectories was found to be stable .",
    "the shortest stable periodic orbit we found has a length @xmath48 .",
    "note that the eigenvalues of the monodromy matrix corresponding to this orbit are on the unit circle and very close to the real axis .",
    "thus it is difficult to distinguish this orbit from a marginally stable orbit .",
    "we also obtained periodic orbits ( in addition to the bouncing - ball orbits ) that are marginally stable , i.e. the eigenvalues of the monodromy matrix are real with modulus one .",
    "the shortest of these orbits has a length @xmath49 .",
    "other marginally stable orbits have periods @xmath50 .    to study the relevance of these orbits , we show the length spectrum of the billiard for @xmath4 in fig .",
    "diamonds denote the lengths of bouncing - ball orbits and of nongeneric periodic orbits associated with the @xmath1 plane ; they account for many peaks in the length spectrum .",
    "we also computed the lengths , monodromy matrices and maslov indices of the 400 shortest unstable and marginally stable orbits by proceeding as in the case @xmath3 .",
    "however , we have no semiclassical theory for the computation of the density of states for the marginally stable and the stable orbit , and we are not able to disentangle their contribution to the length spectrum from that of the nongeneric modes . for this reason we show in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] the length spectrum of the billiard and indicate the lengths of the nongeneric orbits by diamonds , and those of the marginally stable orbits by the full arrows .",
    "the dashed arrow marks the length of the stable orbit .",
    "it is difficult to clearly identify its impact on the length spectrum , since the peak around length @xmath51 can be attributed to the stable orbit and/or to a nongeneric orbit .",
    "recall that a stable orbit leaves a strong imprint in the length spectrum if the stable island around it is sufficiently large ( in units of @xmath52 ) to accommodate eigenstates . to obtain an estimate for the phase - space volume of the elliptical island we started bundles of @xmath53 trajectories in the psos close to the stable periodic orbit .",
    "all trajectories departed from the stable orbit after a few intersections with the psos . within the achievable numerical accuracy we may thus conclude , that either the volume of the phase space associated with the stable orbit is very small or that contrary to our numerical results it is only marginally stable .",
    "note that there are several marginally stable orbits associated with the third arrow from the left .",
    "these orbits have almost identical lengths , and the visual inspection indicates that they are whispering gallery orbits . in this case , interference effects might explain why there is no clear peak in the length spectrum associated with these orbits . a similar effect has been found in the two - dimensional stadium billiard  @xcite . in the next section we present evidence that the stable and marginally stable orbits explain peculiarities in the level statistics of the billiard with @xmath4 .",

    "in this section we investigate statistical properties of the eigenvalues of the three - dimensional stadium billiard for a varying ratio of the radii @xmath54 of the two quarter cylinders , where the volume of the billiard is kept fixed .",
    "we computed the lowest 1200 levels with a recently developed finite element method  @xcite described in the appendix .",
    "the lowest 200 levels are discarded since we are interested in the correspondence between classical and quantum mechanics . in order",

    "the trace formula by balian and duplantier  @xcite has to be employed for the semiclassical computation of the length spectrum .",
    "it differs from gutzwiller s trace formula in the occurrence of a factor associated with the polarization , and as a consequence , only periodic orbits with an even number of reflections enter .",

    "the experimental length spectrum was well reproduced by the theoretical calculations based on the trace formula derived by balian and duplantier . as there the polarization of the electric field is taken into account for each unstable periodic orbit individually ,",

    "the billiard is symmetric with respect to reflections at the @xmath1 plane and a subsequent @xmath14-rotation about the @xmath5-axis .",
    "accordingly , in this case the wave functions of the billiard are symmetric or antisymmetric under the symmetry operation and belong to different irreducible representations ( ir ) .",
    "assuming that the billiard is chaotic , the spectral properties of levels within each ir are expected to coincide with those of random matrices from the goe . however , the spectral statistics for the whole set of eigenvalues should coincide with rmt for a superposition of two independent goes .",
