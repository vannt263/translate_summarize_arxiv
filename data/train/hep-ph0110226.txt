    "the theoretical understanding of @xmath6 is even much less clear .",
    "there have been many theoretical attempts to predict the nucleon strange form factors , differing by the methods used to study the non - perturbative physics behind them : vmd models with @xmath0 mixing [ @xcite ] , skyrme models [ @xcite ] , nambu - jona - lasinio soliton model [ @xcite ] , su(3 ) chiral bag model [ @xcite ] , kaon loop model [ @xcite ] , meson exchange model [ @xcite ] , lattice qcd [ @xcite ] , chiral quark model [ @xcite ] , su(3 ) chiral quark - soliton model [ @xcite ] , hbchpt [ @xcite ] , unitary and analytic model with @xmath0 mixing [ @xcite ] and dispersion relation approach [ @xcite ] .",
    "so , the range of predictions for the strange nucleon ff s is broad and obtained results are mutulally contradicting . the latter illustrates the sensitivity of see quark observables to model assumptions and , on the other hand , the limited usefulness of models in making realistic predictions .",
    "one could hope for more insight from chpt , which relies on the chiral symmetry of qcd .",
    "however , the application of chpt is restricted in energy and mereover , depends [ @xcite ] on unknown counterterms , which have to be determined from data , including the data on the strange nucleon ff s to be charged by sizable error bars , for which one expects predictions just from chpt . in this paper",
    "we turn our attention to the dispersion relation approach [ @xcite ] , which , similarly to chpt , relies on general principles of quantum field theory , including also qcd , and seems to bring some insight into @xmath6 as well , relating existing experimental data to the observables of interest . in the dispersion relation approach it",
    "is analyticity and unitarity , rather than chiral symmetry , which allow one to make such a relation .",
    "practically it means first , on the base of the assumed analytic properties and the asymptotic behaviours of ff s , to write down substracted ( or unsubracted ) dispersion integral relations and then to use the unitarity condition for a derivation of relations of the imaginary parts of ff s under the integrals to amplitudes of physical processes .",
    "though , there is an infinit number of contributing terms into imaginary parts of ff s , the lightest intermediate states in the unitarity condition generate dominant contributions to the leading moments of the strange current .",
    "the lowest one is the 3@xmath9 contribution , which can resonate into a state having the same quantum numbers as the @xmath10-meson ( nearly pure @xmath11 state ) .",
    "thus , the 3@xmath9 state can contribute appreciably to the strange nucleon ff s via its coupling to the @xmath10-meson .",
    "the next important is the @xmath12 intermediate state , which is the lightest state containing valence strange quarks and represents so - called `` kaon cloud dominance '' in the strange nucleon ff s .    in order to estimate @xmath12 contributions to the corresponding spectral functions , following the analysis in [ @xcite ]",
    ", one can express e.g. the absorptive part of the strange nucleon electric ff @xmath13 ( and similarly for @xmath14 ) as a product of the appropriate j=1 @xmath15 partial wave amplitude @xmath16 and the strange vector form factor of kaons @xmath17 as follows [ @xcite ] @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 in @xmath16 are denoting corresponding helicities .    in the spirit of a discussion above , that futher theoretical improvements are needed to constrain the uncertainties in the experimental measurements of the strange nucleon ff s ,",
    "the problem is now to determine @xmath21 and @xmath17 as reliably as possible .",
    "whereas the @xmath22 j=1 partial wave @xmath23 can be determined [ @xcite ] by an analytic continuation of the data on the @xmath24 amplitude into the unphysical region , there exists no experimental infomation on @xmath17 and one has to find a position in some specific models of @xmath17 , like a simple @xmath10-dominance form [ @xcite ] , gounaris - sakurai parametrization [ @xcite ] of the electromagnetic ( em ) ff @xmath25 with the replacement of the @xmath26 mass and width with those of @xmath10 , or the sum of breit - wigner terms [ @xcite ] of the form [ @xcite ] @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are determined by the relations [ @xcite ] @xmath30 from the values of @xmath31 , @xmath32 determined in a fit of data on the kaon em ff s measured by @xmath33 processes .    in this paper",
    "we follow the procedure in [ @xcite ] , but for a parametrization of the kaon em ff s and kaon strange ff we apply more sophisticated unitary and analytic models , which unify all known ff properties always into one analytic function in a very natural way and as a result , one can expect to obtaine realistic behaviour of @xmath34 .",
    "the strange - quark vector current ff of k - mesons @xmath35 is defined by the matrix element of the strange - quark current @xmath36 @xmath37 in analogy to a definition of the em ff s of k -mesons , @xmath38 and @xmath39 @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the em current operator written by means of the @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 quark fields , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are four momenta of k - mesons and @xmath47 is the four momentum transfer squared .",
    "the ff s @xmath48 and @xmath49 can be decomposed into isoscalar and isovector parts @xmath50 to be defined by the following matrix elements @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are isoscalar and isovector parts of the em current @xmath54 given by ( [ rov3 ] ) , respectively .",
    "since the strange - quark vector current @xmath55 carries the quantum numbers of the isoscalar part of the em current @xmath56 , then the strange ff @xmath57 can contribute only to a behaviour of the isoscalar part @xmath58 of the kaon em ff s .",
    "so , it is natural to expect that in principle one could draw out the behaviour of @xmath57 just from the isoscalar part @xmath58 of the kaon em ff s . really , if there is a suitable model of @xmath59 \\label{rov6}\\ ] ] and @xmath60 \\label{rov7}\\ ] ] is the model of the same analytic structure , but with different norm and different asymptotic behaviour ( therefore denoted by @xmath61 ) , then starting from the @xmath62-@xmath10 mixing and assuming that the quark - current of some flavour couples with universal strength exclusively to the component of the vector - meson wave function with the same flavour , one can prove [ @xcite ] the following relations @xmath63      practically the em structure of k - mesons we describe by the unitary and analytic model [ @xcite ] @xmath67&=&\\left ( \\frac{1-v^2}{1-v^2_n}\\right)^2 \\left [ \\frac{1}{2}\\eee v\\se \\right .",

    "similarly , we construct the unitary and analytic model of the strange - quark vector current ff of k - mesons @xmath82&=&\\left(\\frac{1-v^2}{1-v_n^2}\\right)^6 \\left [ -\\eee v\\se\\right .",

    "the @xmath85 and @xmath86 are strangeness - current - vector - meson ( @xmath62 and @xmath10 , respectively ) coupling constants .    with the aim of a determination of free parameters in isoscalar and isovector parts of em ff s of k- mesons ,",
    "@xmath80 $ ] and @xmath81 $ ] , the latter are compared through the relations ( [ rov4 ] ) with all existing data on @xmath87 and @xmath88 , simultaneously .",
    "the results with @xmath89=1.6 are graphically presented in fig.1 .",
    "important parameters of @xmath80 $ ] for a prediction of @xmath90 $ ] behaviour are found to be @xmath91 @xmath92 from where , by means of the relations ( [ rov8 ] ) , one finally evaluates unknown parameters of @xmath90 $ ] in ( [ rov7 ] ) to be @xmath93    then by means of the unitary and analytic model ( [ rov11 ] ) the strange - quark vector current form factor behaviour of k - mesons in space - like and time - like regions , as graphically presented in fig.2 , is predicted which is formed also by @xmath10-meson , similarly to [ @xcite ] , but besides the latter also @xmath62-meson contributes and the height and the shape of @xmath34 are different .    a prediction of a corresponding spectral function behavior is shown in fig.3 . here",
    "we would like to note , that the obtained results depend on the precision of existing data on the kaon em ff s .",
    "one hopes that the substantial improvement , at least at the @xmath10-region , will be obtained by vepp-2 m and da@xmath94ne soon .",
    "consequently even more accurate predictions for @xmath95 $ ] behaviour could be achieved .",
