    "over the last few decades uo@xmath0 has been one of most widely studied actinide oxides due to its technological importance as standard fuel material used in nuclear reactors .",
    "there exists currently considerable interest in understanding the behavior of nuclear fuel in reactors which is a complex phenomenon , influenced by a large number of materials properties , such as thermomechanical strength , chemical stability , microstructure , and defects .",
    "especially , knowledge of the fuel s thermodynamic properties , such as specific heat , thermal expansion , and thermal conductivity , is essential to evaluate the fuel s performance in nuclear reactors.@xcite these thermodynamic quantities are directly related to the lattice dynamics of the fuel material.@xcite    dolling _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite were the first to measure phonon dispersion curves of uo@xmath0 , using the inelastic neutron scattering technique in 1965 ; their seminal article has become the standard reference for uranium dioxide s phonon spectrum .",
    "later the vibrational properties of uo@xmath0 were investigated in detail by schoenes,@xcite using infrared and raman spectroscopic techniques . a good agreement with phonon frequencies obtained from inelastic neutron scattering was observed .",
    "@xcite more recently , livneh and sterer @xcite studied the influence of pressure on the raman scattering in uo@xmath0 and livneh @xcite demonstrated the resonant coupling between longitudinal optical ( lo ) phonons and u@xmath1 crystal field excitations in a raman spectroscopic investigation . a theoretical investigation of the phonon spectra of uo@xmath0 was reported recently by yin and savrasov @xcite who employed a combination of a density - functional - theory ( dft ) based technique and a many - body approach .",
    "according to their results , the low thermal conductivity of uo@xmath0 stems from the large anharmonicity of the lo modes resulting in no contribution from these modes in the heat transfer .",
    "@xcite investigated the phonon properties of uo@xmath0 using an empirical interatomic potential based on the shell model and observed that the calculated thermodynamic properties including the specific heat are in good agreement with available experimental data .",
    "devey @xcite employed recently the generalized gradient approximation with additional coulomb @xmath2 ( gga+@xmath2 ) to compute the main phonon mode frequencies at the brillouin zone center which were in reasonable agreement with experimental data .",
    "very recently , sanati _",
    "et al._@xcite used the gga and gga+@xmath2 approaches to investigate phonon density of states and elastic and thermal constants , which were found to be in reasonably good agreement with experimental data . in spite of the already performed studies ,",
    "further investigations are needed .",
    "especially , the full dispersions of the phonons in reciprocal space have not yet been considered . also , important quantities such as the thermal expansion coefficient and heat capacity are directly related to the lattice vibrations but these quantities have not yet been studied _ ab initio _ from the calculated phonon spectrum .",
    "the objective of this study is to contribute to a detailed understanding of the lattice vibrations of uo@xmath0 . using the first - principles approach , based on the dft we have calculated phonon dispersion curves and phonon density of states of uo@xmath0 .",
    "the calculated phonon properties are compared with the available experimental data from inelastic neutron scattering and raman spectroscopy along with a detailed discussion . furthermore",
    ", several thermodynamic properties have been computed taking the influence of lattice vibrations into account . here , we report the lattice contribution to the heat capacity as function of temperature as well as temperature and volume ( in the quasiharmonic approximation ) .",
    "the dependence of the total free energy on the lattice constant of uo@xmath0 as a function of temperature has calculated , from which we derive the thermal expansion coefficient .",
    "the thermal expansion coefficient as well as lattice heat capacity compare favorably to available experimental data up to 500 k , which is the temperature range in which the influence of anharmonicity can be neglected .",
    "the electronic structure of uo@xmath0 has been discussed in the past years .",
    "@xcite dft calculations within the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) underestimate the influence of the strong on - site coulomb repulsion between the @xmath3 electrons .",
    "an improved @xmath3 electronic structure description can be obtained with the gga+@xmath2 approach , in which a supplementary on - site coulomb repulsion term is added ; this approach correctly gives the electronic band gap of uo@xmath0.@xcite while the gga+@xmath2 approach would appear preferable for description of uo@xmath0 s electronic structure , we encountered specific problems when using this method .",
    "some of the phonon branches became negative away from the zone center .",
    "this artifact might be related to the occupation matrix of @xmath3 states that would require an additional stabilizing constraint in the gga+@xmath2 method.@xcite using conversely the spin - polarized gga approach , we found that such difficulties did not occur .",
    "the phonon dispersion spectrum presented below is hence computed with the gga exchange - correlation for antiferromagnetically ordered uo@xmath0 and is found to be in good agreement with experiment.@xcite    here , we have determined the phonon dispersion curves and density of states ( dos ) in the quasiharmonic approximation using the direct method . @xcite by displacing one atom in a supercell ( of 96 atoms ) from its equilibrium position , non - vanishing hellmann - feynman forces were generated . due to the high symmetry of the face - centered cubic ( fcc ) lattice of uo@xmath0 , only one atom for uranium ( u ) and for oxygen ( o ) was needed to be displaced . the actual shift of the atoms in the supercell had an amplitude of 0.03  and was taken along the [ 001 ] direction only , on account of the cubic symmetry of uo@xmath0 . in the calculation of the resulting forces we employed",
    "the projector augmented wave ( paw ) pseudopotential approach within the vienna ab - initio simulation package ( vasp).@xcite the phonon code @xcite has been used to extract the force constant matrix from the hellmann - feynman forces and to subsequently calculate the phonon dispersion curves and dos .    for the thermodynamic quantities we consider the total free energy of uo@xmath0 , including the phonon contribution , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the helmholtz free energy at a given strain @xmath6 .",
    "the phonon free energy contribution @xmath7 is expressed as @xmath8 , \\label{eqn : phononenergy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the phonon dos , computed as mentioned above .",
    "we note that the free electronic energy , @xmath10 , is not considered in the present study , because the thermal electronic contribution is known to be negligible in the temperature range up to 1000k , which is the range of interest in this work.@xcite the static lattice energy @xmath11 ) appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : helmholtz ] ) can be expressed as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the static lattice energy at zero strain , @xmath14 are the elastic constants , and @xmath15 is the equilibrium volume at @xmath16  k. the static lattice energies have also been calculated using the vasp code.@xcite    in our calculations we have used a 2@xmath172@xmath172 supercell containing 96 atoms with a 4@xmath174@xmath174 @xmath18-point mesh in the brillouin zone ( bz ) .",
    "the perdew - wang parametrization@xcite of the gga functional was used .",
    "the kinetic energy cut - off for the plane waves was set at 600 ev and the energy criterion used for convergence was 10@xmath19 ev .",
    "the force acting on each ion was converged until less than 0.01 ev /  .",
    "once the phonon dos has been calculated , the thermal expansion of uo@xmath0 can be evaluated straightforwardly .",
    "first , the phonon dos with static lattice energy is calculated for several volumes around the @xmath20  k equilibrium volume .",
    "subsequently , the total free energies are calculated for these different volumes at constant temperature using eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : helmholtz])-([eqn : staticenergy ] ) .",
    "after the free energy has been calculated its minimum gives the corresponding equilibrium volume at the considered temperature . by repeating the process for different temperatures , the thermal expansion coefficient @xmath21 defined by @xmath22",
    "is obtained ; here @xmath23 is the lattice constant .    a further thermodynamic quantity , the lattice contribution to the specific heat can be derived from @xmath24 at a fixed temperature in the quasiharmonic approximation .",
    "uo@xmath0 crystallizes in the cubic fluorite structure ( caf@xmath0 ) belonging to the @xmath25 space group ( no .  225 ) and there are three atoms per primitive unit cell with one u atom ( wyckoff position @xmath26 ) and two inequivalent o atoms ( wyckoff positions @xmath27 ) .",
    "therefore , there are generally nine phonon branches . before turning to the description and analysis of the calculated lattice dynamics",
    "let us briefly consider the ground - state properties of uo@xmath0 . as mentioned above the employed dft framework is that of the spin - polarized gga .",
    "the calculated equilibrium lattice constant _ a _ and bulk modulus _",
    "b _ , which we have obtained by a birch - murnaghan @xmath28 order fit,@xcite are presented in table [ bulk ] , where these are compared to experimental lattice properties.@xcite our calculated equilibrium volume as well as the bulk modulus compare reasonably well with the experimental data and with results from molecular dynamics simulations.@xcite compared to the experimental lattice constant the lattice constant computed here is 1.2% smaller .",
    "this can be attributed to a too strong binding of the @xmath3 orbitals which become too much delocalized in the spin - polarized - gga approach . in the gga+@xmath2 approach",
    "the @xmath3 orbitals are more localized and their contribution to the bonding reduced , @xcite which leads to a theoretical lattice parameter which is larger than the experimental one.@xcite    .calculated equilibrium lattice constant _ a _ ( in  ) and bulk modulus _",

    "[ fig2 ] ]    figure  [ fig2 ] shows the calculated and measured phonon dos .",
    "the blue , red , and green lines with square , triangle , and diamond symbols indicate the phonon dos computed for @xmath23=5.330  , 5.406  , and @xmath32  , respectively . the experimental data@xcite ( @xmath33  , @xmath31=296k ) are plotted with the black line .",
    "the u contribution to the calculated phonon doss gives rise to a higher intensity and narrower peak widths in the lower frequency region .",
    "the more broadened dos with lower intensity that occurs in the higher frequency region is mainly derived from the oxygen atoms .",
    "a notable difference between the phonon dos at the three lattice parameters is the size and position of the phonon gap occurring for frequencies of about @xmath34 thz . for the experimental lattice parameter",
    "@xmath35  the computed gap practically closes .",
    "the experimental phonon dos spectrum at this lattice parameter shows a minimum at about 6 thz , in reasonable agreement , considering some experimental broadening .",
    "we note that the trend of decreasing gap with larger lattice constant continues , leading to a closing of the gap computed for larger lattice constants ( not shown ) .",
    "overall , the computed phonons dos of both the theoretical equilibrium ( @xmath36  ) and the experimental lattice parameter are in good accordance with the measured spectrum .",
    "the phonon dos of the theoretical lattice parameter agrees best with the experimental data at higher frequencies ( 7 to 13 thz ) , where the peaks coincide with the measured ones .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the lo2 mode lies both lower in the computed spectra and is more dispersive than in the measurements .",
    "we note that the recent gga+@xmath2 calculations@xcite provide a sharper dos peak at 17 thz , due to a flatter lo2 dispersion near the zone boundaries . at the zone center",
    "the lo2 branch lies however much deeper than in the experiment , at 10 thz ( _ vs. _ 17 thz in experiment ) .",
    "the calculated phonon dos enables us to evaluate some thermodynamic quantities which depend on the lattice vibrations .",
    "we start with the thermal expansion .",
    "the phonon contribution to the total free energy of uo@xmath0 increases with increasing temperature and hence becomes progressively responsible for changes of the lattice parameters . to compute the thermal expansion of uo@xmath0 we have first computed the total free energy , including the phonon contribution , for various lattice parameters , from which we computed the temperature - dependent lattice constant .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] ( bottom ) shows the calculated variation of the lattice constant with temperature .",
    "the red curve gives the spline interpolation of the calculated lattice constants , shown by the symbols .",
    "the thermal expansion coefficient @xmath38 was subsequently evaluated by differentiating the spline fit .",
    "the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the calculated thermal expansion coefficient , which is in good agreement with experimental data@xcite up to 500  k. the deviation between the calculated and measured data slightly increases above 500  k and becomes significant at around 1000  k. this might be due to an increased electronic contribution to the thermal expansion . at very low temperatures , in the region between 0 and 50  k",
    ", a deviation is also observed between the calculated and measured data .",
    "the origin of this deviation is not unambiguously clear .",
    "we note however that uo@xmath0 undergoes a magnetic phase transition at 31  k ( see ref .  ) , which may add an additional influence on the lattice parameter .     of uo@xmath0 .",
    "the experimental data are those of taylor.@xcite bottom : computed temperature - dependent lattice parameter of uo@xmath0 ( open squares ) and spline fit function .",
    "[ fig3 ] ]      next , we employ the helmholtz free energy to compute the lattice heat capacity at constant volume ( @xmath39 ) and at constant pressure ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "[ hc ] shows theoretical results for @xmath39 , computed with the harmonic approximation , and @xmath40 , computed with the quasiharmonic approximation , as well as experimental results@xcite for @xmath40 up to 1000  k. first the lattice contribution to the specific heat @xmath39 was computed as a function of temperature for the equilibrium lattice constant , @xmath36  .",
    "subsequently , the specific heat at constant pressure was derived according to @xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath23 , and @xmath43 are the calculated linear thermal expansion coefficient , the equilibrium lattice constant , and the bulk modulus ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) .",
    "[ hc ] illustrates that there is a very good agreement between the computed heat capacity @xmath40 and the experimental data.@xcite note that the sharp anomaly in the experimental data at @xmath44  k is due to the aforementioned magnetic phase transition,@xcite which effect is not included in the calculations .",
    "clearly , the specific heat at constant pressure is in much better agreement with the experimental data at higher temperatures than @xmath39 , which is mainly due to the thermal expansion of uo@xmath0 .",
    "conversely , evaluating @xmath40 for the theoretical equilibrium lattice constant or for the experimental lattice constant @xmath35  only gives very minor differences .",
    "the computed @xmath40 curves fall somewhat below the experimental @xmath40 data for temperatures in the range of 400 to 1000  k. the uranium atoms in uo@xmath0 are in the paramagnetic state at higher temperatures.@xcite therefore , the remaining difference between experimental and computed data above @xmath45  k could be due to the magnetic entropy contribution to the specific heat or , alternatively , it could be due to the anharmonic effects .",
    "the magnetic entropy contribution to the specific heat was investigated for @xmath46 to 300  k in refs .   and .",
    "at higher temperatures it saturates to approximately @xmath47 , corroborating a magnetic @xmath48 state on the uranium atoms .",
    "it provides to a relatively small magnetic entropy contribution that would lead to a small increase of the computed @xmath40 data ( by about 3 jmol@xmath49k@xmath49 ) .     at constant volume , @xmath39 , computed within the harmonic approximation ( full curve ) , and a constant pressure , @xmath40 , computed with the quasiharmonic approximation ( dashed lines ; for @xmath36  and the experimental @xmath35  ) .",

    "we find that the calculated phonon dispersions are in good agreement with experimental dispersions@xcite measured using inelastic neutron scattering .",
    "computing the phonon dispersions for various lattice constants , we observed a softening of the phonon frequencies with decreasing lattice constant .",
    "furthermore , the band gap between ta and lo modes at high - symmetry zone - boundary points are found to depend significantly on the volume .",
