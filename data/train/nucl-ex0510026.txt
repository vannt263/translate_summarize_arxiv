    "the study of ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions provides insight into properties of very high density nuclear matter .",
    "since the observed particle distributions to first order only reflect the conditions in the final state of the system , signatures originating from the early stage are needed to conclude whether the system passes through a partonic phase .",
    "this is one necessary step to identify the predicted state of matter called the quark - gluon plasma ; the other one being the proof that the system is thermalized .",
    "one observable which is sensitive to the early stage of the collision is the second harmonic coefficient , @xmath0 , of the fourier expansion of the azimuthal momentum distribution , called elliptic flow @xcite . in non - central collisions",
    "the initial spatial anisotropy is transformed into an anisotropy in momentum - space if sufficient interactions occur among the constituents within the system .",
    "once the system has expanded enough to quench the spatial anisotropy , further development of momentum anisotropy ceases .    in the following",
    "we will discuss results on @xmath0 for identified hadrons measured in @xmath1 minimum bias au+au collisions from the star experiment at rhic .",
    "with the high statistics available from rhic s run iv the coverage for identified hadron @xmath0 was extended up to @xmath11 by disentangling the different contributions to the overall @xmath12 , as shown in fig.[fig:1 ] . to suppress non - flow effects",
    ", particles were correlated to the reaction plane determined in the opposite @xmath13-subevent .",
    "the difference of this @xmath0-measurement from the results of the method where the event plane is measured over the full acceptance , is an estimate of one of the contributions to the systematic error ; another factor in the systematic error is based on the estimated level of contamination of protons by kaons .",
    "the systematic errors are shown as bands in fig.[fig:1 ] , while the error bars include statistical uncertainties only . at low",
    "@xmath5 the systematic errors were estimated to be less than 10% @xcite .     for identified hadrons ( upper panel ) and ratio ( lower panel ) between the measurements and a polynomial fit through all data points except pions for 200  gev minimum bias au+au collisions . for both figures",
    "the open symbols for @xmath3 and @xmath4 were taken from @xcite.[fig:2 ] ]    while the proton @xmath0 saturates at @xmath14 the measurements for @xmath3 show a decline starting from their maximum at about @xmath15 .",
    "the flow of these non - strange hadrons is strikingly similar to that of the strange particles @xmath16 and @xmath17 . the mesons and baryons fall into separate groups and this behavior seems to extend out to rather high transverse momentum .",
    "most surprisingly , even at the highest @xmath5 measured a large @xmath0 is still observed .",
    "this appears to be in contradiction to parton energy loss models @xcite and multi - component calculations @xcite , which both predict a smaller @xmath0 at and above @xmath18 . at these high momenta",
    "the remaining @xmath0 value should be essentially driven by the path - length dependence of jet quenching only @xcite .",
    "to further study the observed grouping into mesons vs.  baryons , the top of fig.[fig:2 ] shows the scaled @xmath19 for identified hadrons over a broad range of scaled transverse momentum @xmath20 . here",
    "@xmath21 is the number of constituent quarks ( ncq ) of a given hadron .",
    "figure  [ fig:2 ] , bottom displays the ratio between the measurements and a polynomial fit to all data . at low @xmath20",
    "@xmath22 the observed deviations from the fit follow a mass - ordering which is expected from hydrodynamic flow . at higher @xmath5 ,",
    "all @xmath19 measurements are very close to the common ` mean value ' .",
    "while the shown errors include statistical uncertainties only , it is still striking to see that the similarity of the scaled @xmath0 extends out to @xmath20 as high as @xmath23 .",
    "it seems that all mesons fall above the fit while all baryons fall below .",
    "the observation that the @xmath24 is similar for all the different particle species , strongly supports quark coalescence ( see for example @xcite ) as the dominant process of hadronization in the intermediate @xmath5 region . with the available statistics small deviations from exact ncq - scaling are now detectable , which were expected even for simple recombination models @xcite .",
    "compared to @xmath3 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 @xcite , measurements of particle spectra at rhic have shown that the multi - strange hadrons @xmath6 and @xmath27 are less affected by the hadronic phase @xcite than by the partonic phase . it has been demonstrated @xcite that the @xmath28 and @xmath29 baryons possess a significant amount of @xmath0 , which suggests that this azimuthal anisotropy is generated at an early and partonic stage of the system s evolution .    for the @xmath6 meson , earlier measurements disfavored kaon coalescence as the dominant channel for @xmath6 production at rhic energies @xcite . also its lifetime is long compared to the lifetime of the fireball .",
    "hence the @xmath6 is a useful probe of the early stage of the system as well .",
    "the @xmath0 of the @xmath6 is particularly interesting , since the @xmath6-mass of @xmath30 is similar to the mass of the proton @xmath31 .     for strange hadrons ( left ) and multi - strange hadrons ( right ) in 200  gev minimum bias au+au collisions .",
    "the dashed lines show a common fit @xcite to the @xmath16 and @xmath32 data .",
    "hydrodynamic model calculations @xcite are shown as shaded areas .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ]    the new high statistics measurements of azimuthal anisotropy @xmath0 of multi - strange hadrons show strong elliptic flow for all studied particles : @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath6 ( see fig.[fig:3 ] , right ) .",
    "the error bars contain statistical uncertainties only .",
    "for the @xmath6-measurement systematic errors obtained by the comparison of two different methods are also shown .",
    "a common fit to the results obtained for @xmath16 and @xmath17 , as depicted in fig.[fig:3 ] , left and motivated by number - of - constituent - quark scaling @xcite , was used to compare the @xmath0-data of multi - strange hadrons to those of the other particles .",
    "a detailed comparison , carried out by calculating @xmath33 for the difference between the measurements and the fit function ( see tab.[table:1 ] ) , suggests that @xmath7 and @xmath29 indeed flow as strongly as the other baryons , while the @xmath6 favors the similarity to other mesons .",
    "note that the fit function does not reproduce the data perfectly due to small deviations from the exact number - of - constituent - quark scaling , as discussed in sec.[ncqoldi ] .",
    ".comparison of @xmath34 measurements for multi - strange hadrons to a common fit @xcite to @xmath34 of @xmath16 and @xmath35 .",
    "[ table:1 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]      +    since the @xmath6 flows like a meson and not as strongly as baryons , e.g.  the proton with its similar mass , it is found that the observed scaling is a meson - baryon effect and not a mass effect .",
    "the observed strong flow of multi - strange hadrons substantiates the development of collectivity among partons at rhic .",
    "we have presented the azimuthal anisotropy parameter @xmath0 for identified particles in 200gev minimum bias au+au collisions .",
    "elliptic flow of @xmath36 and @xmath3 was measured up to @xmath37 , where these particles still show a strong @xmath0 signal .",
    "the observed meson - baryon grouping at intermediate @xmath5 suggests parton coalescence to be the dominant process of hadronization in that region , even though small deviations from ideal number - of - constituent - quark scaling are observed .",
    "this scaling is a meson - baryon effect and not a mass effect . finally , the multi - strange hadrons @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath38 flow as strongly as the other mesons and baryons , which confirms partonic collectivity at rhic .",
    "the remaining item to address for the discovery of a quark - gluon plasma is the thermalization of the system .",
