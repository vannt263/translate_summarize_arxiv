    "low  mass x  ray binaries ( lmxbs ) are systems where the compact object , either a neutron star or a black hole , accretes matter from a companion with a mass of less than 1 @xmath5 . the neutron ",
    "star lmxb systems are subdivided on the basis of the pattern they trace out in an x  ray colour  colour or hardness ",
    "intensity diagram ( cd or hid , respectively ) in atoll and z sources @xcite .",
    "the x  ray flux measurements combined with the knowledge of the distance have shown that z sources have a high luminosity ( @xmath4l@xmath6 ) and accrete at a rate close to the eddington accretion rate , whereas atoll sources have typical luminosities and inferred accretion rates 5100 times lower ( e.g. see the compilation of source luminosities by ) .",
    "the three branches of the z traced out in a cd or hid by z sources are called ( from top to bottom ) ; horizontal branch , normal branch , and flaring branch.studies of the x  ray variability of z sources revealed two types of quasi ",
    "periodic oscillations ( qpos ) with frequencies less than 100 hz ( horizontal branch oscillations ; hbo and normal branch oscillations ; nbo ) , twin khz qpo peaks , and three types of rapid flickering ( `` noise '' ) , the very low  frequency noise ( vlfn ) , the low  frequency noise ( lfn ) , and the high  frequency noise ( hfn ) ( see ; for reviews ) .",
    "the properties of noise features and the hbos , such as the central frequency and the fractional rms amplitude , are strongly correlated with the position of a source along the horizontal branch .",
    "these correlations , together with the observed increase in the ultra  violet flux in the z source sco  x1 ( ) when the source moves from the horizontal branch via the normal branch to the flaring branch lend support to the idea that the mass accretion rate increases from the horizontal branch via the normal branch to the flaring branch ( see ) .",
    "however , recent observations (; ; ) , together with problems noted before ( most notably secular motion of the z track ; ) show that the situation may be more complex ( e.g. van der klis 2001).khz qpos have now been seen in just over twenty lmxbs , including all z sources (; ) .",
    "potentially they can provide a key to measure the basic properties of neutron stars ( spin rates and perhaps magnetic field strengths , radii and masses ) and thereby constrain the equation of state of ultra  dense matter , and to verify untested general relativistic effects by tracing spacetime just above the neutron star surface ( e.g. ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ) .",
    "the discovery of khz qpos in gx  51 was reported by .",
    "the hbos were discovered by , and the nbos in gx  51 by .",
    "the source was also detected at radio ( ) and infrared wavelengths ( ) . in this paper",
    "we present an analysis of all _ rxte _ observations of gx  51 obtained before 2001 .",
    "we show for the first time the khz qpo separation frequency is not constant in gx  51 .",
    "we show that besides the two harmonically related low  frequency qpos found previously on the horizontal branch , two additional harmonically related broad lorentzian components are needed to obtain a good fit .",
    "we discuss the power spectra and colour  colour diagrams of the black hole candidate xte  j1550564 , the z source gx  51 , and the atoll source 4u  160852 , and conclude that there are some remarkable similarities and differences which have not been appreciated in the past due to differences in analysis conventions between in particular neutron stars and black hole candidates .",
    "gx  51 was observed 76 times in the period spanning july 27 1996 to march 3 2000 with the proportional counter array ( pca : ) on board the _ rossi x  ray timing explorer ( rxte ) _ satellite @xcite .",
    "a log of the observations is presented in table  [ obs_log ] .",
    "the total observing time was @xmath4564 ksec . during @xmath440% of the time only a subset of the 5 detectors was active .",
    "two short observations ( 2 and 4 ) were omitted from our analysis due to data overflows .",
    "data were always obtained in a mode providing 16  s time ",
    "resolution and a high spectral resolution ( 129 channels covering the effective 260 kev range ; the standard 2 mode ) .",
    "in addition , a variety of high time ",
    "resolution modes was used in the various observing campaigns ; for all observations data with a time resolution of at least @xmath7  s were obtained in the energy band spanning 260 kev .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath8 parameter fixed at this value",
    "a detailed analysis of all _ rxte _ observations obtained to date of gx  51 was presented .",
    "the main result of our high  frequency variability study is that the khz qpo peak separation is not constant in gx  51 .",
    "the low  frequency power spectra for s@xmath9 are complex and can be best described by 4 harmonically related lorentzians , in addition to the low  frequency noise ( lfn ) .",
    "two of these lorentzians were not known previously in gx  51 . at s@xmath10",
    "a new component was found in the power spectra .",
    "below we discuss these findings and compare the timing properties and colour  colour diagrams of gx  51 , the black hole candidate xte  j1550564 , and the atoll source 4u  160852 .",
    "we showed that the khz qpo peak separation is not constant .",
    "the data is consistent with a constant peak separation followed by a steep decrease for s@xmath11 , or a parabolic relation between the peak separation and s@xmath12 .",
    "a decrease in peak separation was previously found in sco  x1 ( ) , 4u  160852 ( ) , 4u  172834 ( ) , 4u  173544 ( ) , 4u  170243 ( ) , and gx  17 + 2 ( ) .",
    "we found that in gx  51 the rate of increase in frequency of the lower khz qpo changes near @xmath13hz , causing the peak separation to decrease .",
    "the frequencies of the khz qpos of gx  51 are low in comparison with the other khz qpo z sources ( the lowest frequencies of the lower and upper khz qpo we found are @xmath14 hz , and @xmath15 hz , respectively ) . the lowest upper khz qpo frequency found so far in an atoll source ( 449@xmath220 hz for 4u  0614 + 09 ; ) is at the low ",
    "frequency limit ( @xmath4500 hz for the upper khz qpo ; ) imposed by the sonic point beat frequency model .",
    "the cause of the lower bound on the keplerian frequency in the sonic point beat frequency model is that the radiation drag of the luminosity produced near the surface of the neutron star can only remove the required amount of the specific angular momentum of the gas to make it fall to the neutron star when the gas is close to the neutron star ( ) . unlike 4u  0614 + 09 ,",
    "in the case of gx  51 qpos with still lower frequency did not occur because the source was not found at lower s@xmath12 values but not because the qpo disappeared .",
    "therefore , observations of khz qpos in gx  51 at even lower s@xmath12 values will provide a strong test of the sonic point beat frequency model .    in the so  called two  oscillator model (; ) the angle @xmath16 is defined ( @xmath17 $ ] , where @xmath18 is the frequency of the lower khz qpo , @xmath19 is the frequency of the upper khz qpo , and @xmath20 is the frequency of the hbo ; @xmath16 is the angle between the magnetosphere equator and the disc plane in the model ) .",
    "the current version of the theory predicts @xmath16 to be constant .",
    "however , the measurements of for gx  17 + 2 and the our measurements for gx  51 show that @xmath16 vs. the frequency of the lower khz qpo changes is not constant ( see fig .",
    "[ delta ] ) .",
    "a fit of a constant gives @xmath21 and a @xmath22 of 377 for 9 d.o.f .",
    "for gx  17 + 2 and @xmath23 and a @xmath22 of 95.2 for 9 d.o.f .",
    "for gx  51 .      we have detected a sub  hbo component similar to the component in the z  sources sco  x1 ( ) , gx  340 + 0 @xcite , and gx  17 + 2 ( ) .",
    "furthermore , we found a fourth lorentzian component whose frequency was consistent with 1.5 times the frequency of the hbo .",
    "if we interpret the sub  hbo as the fundamental frequency , then the hbo would be the second harmonic , the newly found peak at 1.5 times the hbo frequency the third harmonic , and the second harmonic of the hbo the fourth harmonic .",
    "in such a scheme the odd harmonics should either be formed less coherently than the even harmonics , or an additional broadening mechanism has to be invoked which broadens the odd harmonics more than the even harmonics ( see fig .  [ harmonics ] ; _ right panel _ ) .",
    "this harmonic structure could be explained in a scenario where the hbo is caused by a warped accretion disc with a two  fold symmetry .",
    "the warp itself is stable to deviations from its two  fold symmetry , i.e. , variations in the warp take place on a timescale long compared to the timescale of variations in the difference between the two sides of the warp , leading to broader odd harmonics .",
    "this connects to the models proposed by and . in the magnetic",
    "beat  frequency model for the hbo (; ) the sub ",
    "hbo should reflect differences between the two magnetic poles .",
    "differences in the magnetic field configuration are not likely to vary in time rapidly , so the extra broadening of the sub  hbo with respect to the hbo is unexplained .",
    "this necessitates the introduction of an additional broadening mechanism working on the odd harmonics only after their formation .",
    "prior to the detection of the sub  hbo and its third harmonic , the frequency of the second harmonic of the hbo was not measured to be exactly twice the hbo frequency ( ) ; with the introduction of the third harmonic of the sub  hbo in the fit function this discrepancy has disappeared ( see fig .  [",
    "harmonics ] ; _ left panel _ ) .",
    "power density spectra calculated from data obtained with the exosat and ginga satellites (; ) were fit using only the even harmonics ( the hbo and its 2@xmath24 harmonic ) and an additional high frequency noise ( hfn ) component .",
    "now , using the larger collecting area of rxte we find that the hfn in gx  51 is better described by two lorentzian components which have centroid frequencies of 0.5 and 1.5 times that of the hbo .",
    "the same function we used for our analysis of gx  51 was used in the analysis of the similar z source gx  340 + 0 @xcite .",
    "there no third harmonic of the sub ",
    "hbo was found .",
    "instead we found excess power ( a shoulder ) close to the hbo peak , which when fit with a lorentzian was at a frequency entirely inconsistent with 1.5 times that of the hbo .",
    "reanalysis of those data with the insights gained by our work on gx  51 did not alter this conclusion .",
    "in gx  340 + 0 both the hbo and the nbo peak became asymmetric when they were strongest .",
    "similar behaviour was found in gx  51 , where for s@xmath25 four of the five hbo measurements were done using two lorentzians with centroid frequencies up to 2 hz apart with similar fwhms but different strengths , indicating that the hbo was asymmetric .",
    "however , unlike in our analysis of gx  340 + 0 where the data were selected according to hbo frequency , in the case of gx  51 this asymmetry could be an artifact of the selection method as explained in section  [ newcomp ] . an attempt to fit the average power spectra of gx  17 + 2 ( ) with the same fit function as that of gx  51 did not lead to the detection of a third harmonic to the sub  hbo .",
    "the asymmetry of the hbo found in gx  340 + 0 and the third harmonic of the sub  hbo found in gx  51 could be two different components , one of which is detected in each source because of the special circumstances affecting detections in each case : the larger amplitude of the hbo in gx  340 + 0 than in gx  51 allows to detect a strong asymmetric ( shoulder ) component , whereas the higher signal  to  noise in gx  51 than in gx  340 + 0 ( due to the fact that gx  51 is several times brighter than gx  340 + 0 ) leads to the detection of the broad third harmonic .",
    "new observations with higher signal  to  noise ratios can reveal whether both components are present in both sources or whether they represent power provided by one single component .",
    "the low  frequency power spectra of the three z sources discussed above ( gx  17 + 2 , gx  340 + 0 , gx  51 ) are quantitatively different . in sco  x1 and gx  17 + 2 a qpo",
    "is found when the source is on the flaring branch ( the fbo ; ; ) .",
    "such a qpo is absent in gx  340 + 0 , gx  51 , gx  349 + 2 , and cyg  x2 .",
    "the new component we found in the power spectrum of gx  51 with frequencies similar to those of the fbo when the source is on the flaring branch is much broader than the fbo in sco  x1 and gx  17 + 2 .",
    "the second harmonic of the hbo is relatively strong in gx  17 + 2 while for gx  51 and gx  340 + 0",
    "only weak harmonics have been detected ( see ; ) .",
    "furthermore , the fractional rms amplitude of the hbo is highest in gx  340 + 0 , and lowest for gx  17 + 2 .",
    "the hbo frequency in gx  17 + 2 was found to decrease on the normal branch (; ) , whereas in gx  340 + 0 and gx  51 the frequency is consistent with being constant ( ) . besides the lorentzians also the lfn properties are different ; it is always peaked in gx  17 + 2 whereas this is never the case in gx  51 and gx  340 + 0 ( see ; ; ; ) .",
    "the dependence of the hbo , lower and upper khz qpo q  values on s@xmath12 is shown in fig .",
    "the hbo q  value decreases gradually for s@xmath26 , while that of the khz qpos increases .",
    "this is opposite to what was found for gx  17 + 2 ( ) , where the q  value of the hbo and that of the khz qpos increased as a function of s@xmath12 .      in the power spectra of black hole candidates",
    "frequency qpos with harmonics are occasionally found in the low , intermediate and very high state ( e.g. gs  112468 , ; gx  3394 , ; xte  j1550564 , ; ) .",
    "occasionally , these black hole candidate qpos have asymmetric profiles .",
    "we found a similar harmonic structure of qpos in the z source gx  51 .",
    "the q  values of the harmonics for xte  j1550564 are similar to those found for gx  51 : low q ",
    "values for the odd harmonics and high q ",
    "values for the even harmonics ( ) . however , we checked the energy dependence of the qpos in gx  51 and there are no indications of changes in the q  values with energy as were found in xte  j1550564 ( ) .",
    "in general the energy dependence and time lag behaviour of the qpos in gx  51 ( ) is different from what was found in xte  j1550564 ( ) . on the flaring branch , similar to the high state in black hole candidates , the fractional rms amplitude of the variability is low , and qpos are weak or absent ( in gx  17 + 2 and sco  x1 , just as in xte  j1550564 a qpo with a centroid frequency of @xmath418 hz is found , but whether they are related is unclear ) .",
    "the similarities between the horizontal branch variability and that of the intermediate / low state have been pointed out before (; ; ) .",
    "furthermore , the trend of a decrease in variability timescale as the source approaches the flaring branch / high state is the same in black hole candidates as in gx  51 and 4u  160852 ( cf . ; ) .",
    "to further investigate the similarities between a black hole candidate ( xte  j1550564 ) , a z source ( gx  51 ) , and an atoll source ( 4u  160852 ) we created colour ",
    "colour diagrams ( cds ) for the three sources in two ways .",
    "first , we used the colour definitions commonly used for atoll and z sources ( soft and hard colour were defined as the logarithm of the 3.66.2 / 2.53.6 kev and 9.816.0 / 6.29.8 kev count rate ratio , respectively ) .",
    "these cds are shown in the _ left panels _ of fig .",
    "[ z_as_bhc ] , [ 1550_as_bhc ] , and [ 1608_as_bhc ] .",
    "second , we created cds in a similar way as , an approach often used for black hole candidates (; ; although see also ) .",
    "we defined the hard and soft colour as the 9.716.0/ 26.4 kev and 6.49.7/ 26.4 kev count rate ratio for observations 141 , respectively and that of the 9.715.8 / 26.6 kev and 6.69.7 / 26.6 kev count rate ratio for observations 4276 , respectively ( fig .",
    "[ z_as_bhc ] , _ right panel _ ) . in case of the _ right panels",
    "_ for fig .",
    "[ 1550_as_bhc ] and [ 1608_as_bhc ] the hard and soft colour were defined as the 16.019.4 / 2.26.2 kev , and 6.515.7 / 2.26.2 kev count rate ratio , respectively .",
    "note that in the _ right panels _ the soft colour is plotted vs. the hard colour , as the convention , introduced by @xcite to plot hard colour vs. soft colour was abandoned in some of the recent black hole work . in the _ right panels _ the points have been connected by a line .",
    "lines bridging different parts of the diagrams do not reflect sudden jumps or changes in source state , but are due to gaps introduced by observational windowing . a similar structure as for xte  j1550564 was found in the cd of gx  51 ( figure  [ z_as_bhc ] , [ 1550_as_bhc ] _ right panel _ ) .",
    "the flaring branch is now vertical and located at the left side of the figure , similar to the high state in xte  j1550564 .",
    "the normal branch connects to the flaring branch and points towards the upper right corner of the diagram ( both the hard colour and the soft colour increase as the source moves up the normal branch ) .",
    "the horizontal branch is a continuation of the normal branch , with only a slight bend at the normal branch  horizontal branch junction .",
    "( it is interesting to note that there is also no vertex present in gx  17 + 2 at the horizontal normal branch junction at energies above 14.8 kev , figure 3c of ) .",
    "the dipping flaring branch is parallel to the normal branch but directed towards the lower left corner .",
    "the dipping flaring branch has been found in the z sources cyg  x2 , gx  51 and gx  340 + 0 (; ; ) .",
    "the cd of the atoll source 4u  160852 again shows a similar structure as found for xte  j1550564 ( fig .",
    "[ 1550_as_bhc ] , [ 1608_as_bhc ] _ right panels _ ) .",
    "the island state is found in the top right corner of the _ right panel _ of fig .",
    "[ 1608_as_bhc ] , whereas the lower banana branch connects to the upper banana branch in the lower left corner .",
    "the upper banana branch seems similar to the black hole candidate high state and the z source flaring branch .",
    "the cd of the black hole candidate xte  j1550564 , plotted using colours typically applied for neutron star sources is reminiscent of that of an atoll source , although more structure is observed ( fig .",
    "[ 1550_as_bhc ] _ left panel _ ) .",
    "the source was first found in the upper right part of the cd as the outburst started .",
    "the path traced by the source as the outburst progressed is indicated with arrows . for a complete description of the outburst of xte",
    "j1550564 we refer to , , and .",
    "the similarities between the colour  colour diagrams of the z source gx  51 , the atoll source 4u  160852 , and",
    "the black hole candidate xte  j1550564 strengthen the idea that some of the spectral properties of lmxbs originate in the accretion disc and do not depend on the presence of a solid surface .",
    "however , our analysis also indicates that differences between spectral properties of the neutron star z and atoll sources and the black hole candidates do exist ( e.g. , the _ left panel _ of fig .  [ z_as_bhc ] , [ 1550_as_bhc ] , and [ 1608_as_bhc ] ) but may not clearly show up in representations of the cd commonly used for black  hole candidates .",
    "the explanation for this could be that in the `` black  hole colour scheme '' only three independent colours are defined whereas in the `` neutron star colour scheme '' four colours are usually defined .",
    "so , although the cds of a z or atoll source and that of a black hole candidate appear similar in shape when plotted using colours typical for black hole studies , their appearance is both dissimilar and more complicated when plotted using colours typical for neutron star studies . whether the complications can be ascribed to the unique nature of the sources considered",
    "can only be checked by comparing more sources but the conclusion that dissimilar cds can appear more similar than they really are in the `` black hole '' representation can already be drawn .",
    "conclusions regarding the spectral state or properties of the source based on the colours commonly used in black hole candidates should be regarded with caution since an other choice of colours may lead to a qualitatively different cd .",
