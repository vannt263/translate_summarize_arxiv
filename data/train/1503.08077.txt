    "we denote the unit disc @xmath381 by @xmath382 .    1 .",
    "r - components are unbounded .",
    "the required quasiconformal map on an r - component is the composition of a quasiconformal map to the right half - plane and another map , which in this case we can take to be @xmath383 .",
    "note that r - components are the only components on which bishop s new technique of quasiconformal folding is needed .",
