    "glitches , observed from more than 30 isolated pulsars @xcite , are a sudden jump in pulsar rotation rate . slow recovery of a rotation rate following these events implies the presence of loosely - coupled fluids or neutron superfluids in the interior of a neutron star .",
    "the transfer of angular momentum from the rotating neutron superfluid to the normal matter is likely to be responsible for pulsar glitches and postglitch relaxation .",
    "a rotating neutron superfluid is threaded by quantized vortex lines .",
    "the superfluid can alter its angular velocity by the radial motion of vortices . in the inner crust of a neutron star neutron rich nuclei that form the bcc lattice",
    "coexist with neutron superfluid .",
    "the vortex lines in the inner crust are normally pinned to the lattice nuclei .",
    "difference in velocity between superfluid and nuclear lattice builds up since magnetic braking slows down the nuclear lattice and pinning prevents the vortex lines from moving .",
    "then , the neutron star undergoes sudden unpinning of a large number of vortex lines followed by the outward motion .",
    "this catastrophic unpinning has long been considered as a promising cause for glitches @xcite .",
    "a vortex line is subjected to the magnus force when it moves relative to the superfluid .",
    "the catastrophic unpinning model assumes that the pinning force is strong enough to sustain the vortices to the nuclear lattice against the magnus force until the moment just before glitches .",
    "based on the condensational and kinetic energies , the pinning energy is estimated , ranging approximately @xmath2 mev per nucleus @xcite . this magnitude itself is strong enough against the magnus force expected just before glitches .",
    "jones ( 1992 ) mentions , however , that the pinning forces on a randomly oriented rigid vortex line largely cancel since there are nearly an equal number of pinning sites on either side of the vortex line .",
    "link , epstein , & baym ( 1993 ) find that for a vortex line of finite tension , pinning becomes much more efficient by slightly bending and forming kinks .",
    "recently , jones ( 1997 , 1998 , 1999 ) argues that vortex interaction with a polycrystalline structure does not provide pinning strong enough to explain the large glitches observed in the vela pulsar ( see section [ pinning ] for detail ) .",
    "here we study the vortex configurations , oscillations and pinning in the inner crust of a neutron star . in section [ equation ]",
    "we derive the equation of motion of vortex lines . in section [ configuration ]",
    "we present the equilibrium configurations of vortex lines . in section [ oscillation ]",
    "we examine the stability of equilibrium configurations and the oscillations excited on a vortex line . in section [ pinning ] we discuss the vortex pinning based on the results of the previous sections . in the last section we summarize the results and mention the conclusions .",
    "we consider the motion of vortex lines in an inner crust , where the lattice nuclei are embedded in a superfluid neutron sea .",
    "we adopt the cartesian coordinates fixed in the rest frame of the lattice nuclei .",
    "the z - axis is chosen to be parallel to one of the major axes of a body - centered crystal lattice . in this paper",
    "the most attention will be devoted to configurations and oscillations of vortex lines which are parallel to or slightly inclined against the z - axis .",
    "we limit the inclination angle of a vortex line against the z - axis to a small value .",
    "then , we can describe their motion and configurations by the two - dimensional position vectors , @xmath3 , of vortex lines in the xy plane which depend on the coordinate z. the equation of motion of vortex lines is written as    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the superfluid density , @xmath6 the pinning force per unit length of a vortex line , @xmath7 the circulation of a vortex , @xmath8 the locally uniform superfluid velocity and @xmath9 the tension of the vortex line .",
    "vortices in the superfluid are quantized .",
    "each vortex line carries one quantum @xmath10 of circulation , where @xmath11 is the planck constant and @xmath12 the neutron mass . since we consider the vortex lines aligned or almost aligned with the z - axis , we approximate the circulation vector by    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the unit vector along the z - axis .    in equation ( [ eq : eqmot ] ) the second term represents the magnus force which arises when there exists the relative motion between the local superfluid and the vortex .",
    "the magnus force acting on a unit length of a vortex line is given by    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the vortex velocity .",
    "in the vortex unpinning model the difference in angular velocity between the inner crust superfluid and the crust is reduced significantly just after the glitches , decoupling the inner crust superfluid from the crust .",
    "as the crust is slowed down by the external braking torque , the angular velocity difference @xmath17 builds up between the local superfluid and the lattice nuclei . using the glitch interval @xmath18 and the angular deceleration rate @xmath19 , the angular velocity difference",
    "just before the glitch is estimated as    @xmath20    in the vela pulsar the angular velocity difference and the magnus force acting on the pinned vortex line may amount to @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively , just before the glitches .",
    "the third term in equation ( [ eq : eqmot ] ) comes out from the tension of vortices when vortices are distorted from the straight lines .",
    "the energy of vortex lines is equal to the kinetic energy of the velocity field induced by them .",
    "the tension is given by the energy per unit length ,    @xmath23    where the parameter @xmath24 is only logarithmically dependent on the wave number and the neutron superfluid coherence length @xcite .",
    "for numerical estimates we assume @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the vortex - nucleus interaction has an attractive component arising from the change in the condensation energy and a repulsive component arising from the change in kinetic energy of circulating superfluid .",
    "we adopt only the attractive component since we are interested in the inner portion of the inner crust , where the attractive component is dominant over the repulsive component .",
    "the interaction potential we adopt is @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the pinning energy ( or the interaction energy ) per nucleus , @xmath28 is the vortex core radius or the coherence length of the neutron superfluid and @xmath29 is the distance in the xy plane between the nucleus and the vortex line , @xmath30 . the coherence length of the neutron superfluid is written as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the energy gap for the superfluid neutrons , @xmath33 their fermi energy and @xmath34 the fermi surface wave number @xcite . the pinning force , which acts to pin the vortex line to nuclei , per site is approximately given by @xmath35",
    "we can obtain the lattice - vortex interaction potential by summing the above potential ( [ eq : enpi ] ) contributed from each nucleus over the entire nuclei of a single large crystal .",
    "note that the lattice - vortex interaction potential has the translational properties and hence can be expanded into the fourier series using the reciprocal lattice vectors .",
    "we assume the lattice - vortex interaction potential to be uniform in the z - direction since we are interested in the configurations and oscillations of vortices , which are approximately aligned with the z - axis , with the scale and wave lengths significantly larger than the lattice constant .",
    "hence , of the twelve basic reciprocal lattice vectors of the bcc lattice we adopt the basic four vectors in the xy plane , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , where @xmath38 with @xmath39 being the lattice constant .",
    "then , the lattice - vortex interaction potential per unit length of a vortex line is given by @xmath40,\\ ] ] where the fourier coefficient @xmath41 is @xmath42 at densities of @xmath43 .",
    "we obtain the pinning force acting on the unit length of a vortex line by taking the derivative of @xmath44 with respect to @xmath45 and @xmath46 , @xmath47 \\label{eq : fx}\\ ] ] and @xmath48,\\label{eq : fy}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the @xmath45 and @xmath46 components of the pinning force , respectively .",
    "we conduct the coordinate rotation and transform the variables from @xmath51 to @xmath52 defined as    @xmath53    and @xmath54 using equations ( [ eq : fx ] ) , ( [ eq : fy ] ) , ( [ eq : phi ] ) and ( [ eq : psi ] ) , the equation of motion of vortices ( [ eq : eqmot ] ) reduces to @xmath55 and @xmath56 here and hereafter we assume for simplicity that the neutron superfluid flows in the y - direction . note that equations ( [ eq : eqmot1 ] ) and ( [ eq : eqmot2 ] ) describe the motion of vortices in terms of the components in the directions of reciprocal vectors .",
    "if the vortex lines are completely rigid , the vortex configuration would be simply a straight line .",
    "the tension of a superfluid vortex line in the inner crust of a neutron star , however , is finite .",
    "hence , when the vortex lines undergo the forces such as the pinning and magnus forces , the vortex lines in general are bent and their shape is deformed from the straight line .",
    "we examine the equilibrium configurations of vortex lines here .",
    "we assume that in equilibrium @xmath57 and @xmath58 in equations ( [ eq : eqmot1 ] ) and ( [ eq : eqmot2 ] ) and hence the vortices are stationary with respect to the nuclear lattice .",
    "then , equations ( [ eq : eqmot1 ] ) and ( [ eq : eqmot2 ] ) can be integrated to yield    @xmath59    and    @xmath60    once a displacement and orientation of the vortex line are given at , for example , z = 0 , we can solve equations ( [ eq : stst - int1 ] ) and ( [ eq : stst - int2 ] ) and derive the equilibrium configurations of vortex lines .",
    "hereafter , for numerical calculations we use the physical parameters such as the pinning energy , the coherence length and the lattice constant at densities of @xmath61 , where a large fraction of crust superfluids resides and the pinning energy peaks .",
    "we adopt @xmath62 for the superfluid velocity unless otherwise stated .",
    "the first , second and third terms in equations ( [ eq : stst - int1 ] ) and ( [ eq : stst - int2 ] ) correspond to the pinning force , the magnus force and the vortex tension , respectively .",
    "the pinning force per site is @xmath63 dyne and the vortex tension is @xmath64 dyne , while the magnus force acting on the vortex section of a length corresponding to the lattice constant @xmath39 is @xmath65 dyne .",
    "we note that the magnus term is much smaller than the pinning and tension terms .",
    "we should note that equations ( [ eq : stst - int1 ] ) and ( [ eq : stst - int2 ] ) are analogous to the energy conservation equation for the particle motion in a potential well .",
    "the first and second terms and third term on the left hand side of equations ( [ eq : stst - int1 ] ) and ( [ eq : stst - int2 ] ) may correspond to the potential and kinetic energies in the particle motion , respectively , while the integration constant on the right hand side to the total energy .",
    "the gradient of the vortex line against the z - axis may be looked as the velocity of a particle .",
    "the difference between the `` total and potential energies '' yields the gradient of the vortex line .",
    "the pinning term in equation ( [ eq : stst - int1 ] ) ( equation ( [ eq : stst - int2 ] ) ) has peaks at @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) with @xmath68 being integer , while the magnus term increases ( decreases ) linearly with @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) . as easily inferred from this analogy , solutions to equations ( [ eq : stst - int1 ] ) and ( [ eq : stst - int2 ] ) can be classified into the three characteristic cases in terms of the magnitude of the integration constant ( the `` total energy '' ) relative to the peak values of the potential energy due to the pinning and magnus forces .",
    "let us consider the case where the integration constant ( the `` total energy '' ) in equations ( [ eq : stst - int1 ] ) and ( [ eq : stst - int2 ] ) is just equal to a peak value of the sum of pinning and magnus terms ( the `` potential energy '' ) .",
    "the derivative of @xmath69 and @xmath70 with respect to z should be zero over an entire vortex line .",
    "hence , the equilibrium solution for the vortex configuration is a straight line which is in parallel with the z - axis or the major axis of a single crystal lattice ( fig .",
    "[ straight ] ) .",
    "note that the average orientation of a vortex line expresses the direction of the rotation axis .",
    "thus , the rotation axis of the star is also parallel to the z - axis .",
    "when the magnus term is neglected in equations ( [ eq : stst - int1 ] ) and ( [ eq : stst - int2 ] ) , the straight vortex line passes through the bottom of the pinning potential well along the z - axis . when the magnus term is included , the straight vortex line , though still parallel to the z - axis , is displaced only slightly from the z - axis , @xmath71 and @xmath72 . in actual cases when the magnus force acts on the vortex lines , however ,",
    "the equilibrium configuration of the vortex may deviate from the straight line , though very slightly , since the pinning sites are located discretely along the z - axis .",
    "we have the strongest pinning regime when the rotation axis happens to be oriented along the major axis of a single crystal since the vortex line intercepts the pinning sites most often .",
    "let us move to the case where the integration constant ( the `` total energy '' ) in equations ( [ eq : stst - int1 ] ) and ( [ eq : stst - int2 ] ) is smaller than peak values of the sum of pinning and magnus terms ( the `` potential energy '' ) .",
    "this case corresponds to the motion of a particle which is bound in the potential well .",
    "as the particle exhibits a periodic motion , the vortex line goes back and forth between the two neighboring lattice planes ( fig .",
    "[ sinepmt ] ) .",
    "the average direction of the vortex line and hence the rotation axis of the star are parallel to the z - axis .",
    "note that the significant energy is required to deform the vortex from the straight line to the sinusoid - like shape ( see the next sub - section for the calculation of the total energy of a vortex ) .",
    "hence , it may be the straight vortex line which is realized in nature when the rotation axis is parallel to the z - axis or the major axis of a single crystal lattice .",
    "for simplicity and clarity we neglect the magnus force here .",
    "let us consider the case where the integration constant ( the `` total energy '' ) in equations ( [ eq : stst - int1 ] ) and ( [ eq : stst - int2 ] ) is larger than the peak value of the pinning term ( the `` potential energy '' ) .",
    "this case corresponds to the motion of a particle which continues to move in one direction with varying speed .",
    "the derivative of @xmath69 and @xmath70 with respect to z is not now zero everywhere along a vortex line .",
    "hence , we examine here the equilibrium vortex configuration when the average orientation of a vortex line and hence the rotation axis of the star are inclined against the z - axis ( or the major axis of a single crystal ) .",
    "we study first the equilibrium solutions when the angle between the rotation axis of a star and the major axis of a crystal is infinitesimally small . over an entire interval of a large single crystal the vortex passes from one lattice plane to the adjacent lattice plane .",
    "hence , we set the boundary conditions such as @xmath73 at @xmath74 and @xmath75 at @xmath76 .",
    "then , we can solve equations ( [ eq : stst - int1 ] ) analytically and derive the equilibrium configurations , @xmath77 \\label{eq : kink},\\ ] ] where @xmath78 figure [ kink ] shows that the vortex can move from one lattice plane to the adjacent lattice plane by bending itself and forming a kink when the vortex tension is finite .",
    "the vortex line is displaced substantially from the pinning sites in the kink part , while in the other part the vortex line is straight and passes through nearly all of the pinning sites along the z - axis .",
    "@xmath79 given by equation ( [ eq : kinkl ] ) expresses a length of the kink . in the middle of a kink the vortex line",
    "is inclined against the z - axis by @xmath80 .",
    "energy is needed to create a kink from a straight vortex line since the length of a vortex line increases and a part of it should overcome the pinning potential .",
    "the self - energy of vortex lines is equal to the kinetic energy of the velocity field induced by them .",
    "the increase of the vortex self - energy due to bending is    @xmath81 dz,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    while the energy necessary to overcome the pinning potential is    @xmath82    the length of a kink can be determined from minimizing the sum of @xmath83 and @xmath84 @xcite . using the solution ( [ eq : kink ] ) together with @xmath85 ,",
    "the total energy necessary to form a kink is calculated as @xmath86 which yields @xmath87 at densities of @xmath88 .",
    "we increase gradually the integration constant in equations ( [ eq : stst - int1 ] ) and ( [ eq : stst - int2 ] ) and hence the inclination angle @xmath89 of the rotation axis against the major axis ( z - axis ) of a single crystal .",
    "the vortex lines now should thread through many lattice planes .",
    "we find that when the inclination angle is small and less than @xmath90 , vortex lines in equilibrium configurations move from one lattice plane to the next by forming a clear kink and the number of kinks increases with increasing inclination angle ( fig .",
    "[ stpt ] ) .",
    "the separation @xmath91 in z between the neighboring kinks varies as @xmath92 .",
    "the property of a kink in fig .",
    "[ stpt ] is the same as that in fig .",
    "a vortex line can orient its average direction to the direction of the rotation axis by adjusting a number of kinks .",
    "apart from the kink parts , the vortex lines are straight and in parallel to the z - axis , and are firmly pinned to the lattice nuclei .",
    "even though the extra energy is required to create kinks , the total energy of a vortex line with kinks is much lower than that of the inclined straight vortex line without kinks since except for kink parts the vortex line lies in the bottom region of the pinning potential @xcite .    as the average orientation of a vortex line inclines against the major axis , the separation between the neighboring kinks and hence the portion of a vortex line available for pinning decrease . as seen in fig .",
    "[ stpt ] , the straight pinned part of the vortex line becomes shorter than the kink part when the inclination angle is above @xmath93 .",
    "the vertical pinned portion as well as the kink feature becomes less prominent at @xmath94 .",
    "when the inclination angle exceeds @xmath95 , the equilibrium configuration of a vortex line becomes almost the straight line .",
    "this consequence arises from the fact that the portion of a vortex line for pinning becomes too short to compensate the energy cost for producing kinks when the inclination angle exceeds a certain value .",
    "when the average orientation of a vortex line inclines significantly against the z - axis , we need to include the z - components for both the force and displacement , though neglected here .",
    "we expect that the lattice planes different from those considered here may become important for pinning .",
    "the three dimensional calculations are needed in order to know the equilibrium configuration of a vortex line accurately .",
    "we now examine how the kink solutions are modified when we include the magnus terms in equations ( [ eq : stst - int1 ] ) and ( [ eq : stst - int2 ] ) .",
    "the pinning and magnus terms as a function of @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) are represented by the cosine curve and the inclined straight line , respectively .",
    "hence , there exists @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) at which the integration constant ( the `` total energy '' ) becomes equal to the sum of the pinning and magnus terms ( the `` potential energy '' ) .",
    "the integration constant is larger ( smaller ) than the sum of the pinning and magnus terms at @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) , while smaller ( larger ) at @xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "this case corresponds to the motion of a particle which moves forwards and then at the potential wall bounces to move backwards .",
    "figure [ kink - parab ] illustrates the equilibrium configurations of vortex lines for different superfluid velocities @xmath102 relative to the lattice nuclei .",
    "the equilibrium configuration is characterized locally by a kink and globally by a parabola . as explained above",
    ", the kink arises from the balance between the pinning and tension terms .",
    "as expected from the analogy with the particle motion , the vortex lines extends first rightwards and then leftwards as z increases . when we take a long scale average of equation ( [ eq : eqmot ] ) , the pinning forces , which alternate the sign ( the direction ) along a vortex line ,",
    "cancel out whereas the magnus force , which is constant along a vortex line , is left .",
    "hence , when combined with the tension term in equation ( [ eq : eqmot ] ) , the constant magnus term yields the parabolic configuration .",
    "the curvature radius of a vortex line is given approximately by @xmath103 as the superfluid velocity relative to the lattice nuclei increases , the curvature and hence the deformation due to the magnus force becomes larger ( fig .",
    "[ kink - parab ] ) .",
    "notice also that the kink feature becomes less prominent as the deformation becomes larger due to the same reason as mentioned in the previous sub - section .",
    "the three dimensional calculations are needed again .",
    "numerical estimates in this paper are made mostly by adopting the physical parameters at the inner part of an inner crust , where the density is higher and the pinning energy peaks .",
    "the kink properties and pinning strength depend on matter densities through the nature of nuclei and superfluids .",
    "for example , the kink length and creation energy are @xmath104 and @xmath105 at densities of @xmath43 in the inner part of an inner crust , while @xmath106 and @xmath107 at densities of @xmath108 in the outer part of an inner crust .",
    "the choice of parameters may affect the results .",
    "note , however , that most of crust superfluids reside in the inner part of an inner crust .",
    "hence , even if the outer part of the inner crust is included adequately , the change may be small and may not alter the essence of our conclusions .",
    "the inner crust nuclei are likely to take a polycrystalline structure @xcite .",
    "the orientation of a crystal lattice may change from one domain to another . then , along a vortex line there may lie a large number of single crystals with various orientations against the average direction of a vortex line .",
    "the important physical parameters which vary with the orientation of a crystal lattice are the distance between the neighboring lattice planes for pinning and the distance between the neighboring pinning sites along a vortex line .",
    "it is likely that even when the vortex line is not close to the main axis of a crystal lattice , the equilibrium configuration of a vortex line may also be expressed by a kink solution with the pinning lattice planes different from those containing the main axis of a crystal lattice . as seen from equations ( [ eq : kinkl ] ) and",
    "( [ eq : et ] ) , the kink length and creation energy are in proportion to the distance between the neighboring lattice planes for pinning and depend weakly on the fourier coefficient ( @xmath41 ) of a pinning potential .",
    "the kink properties may vary , though not significantly , depending on the orientation of a crystal lattice .",
    "the pinning strength of a vortex line is inversely proportional to the separation of the neighboring pinning sites along a vortex line .",
    "when the vortex line is not close to the major axis of a crystal lattice , the pinning site distance will be longer and hence the pinning of a vortex line will be less strong .",
    "the various orientations of crystal lattice along a vortex line may reduce the pinning strength of a vortex line as a whole compared to the case with a small inclination angle .",
    "we expect , however , that pinning , though weaken , is still strong enough to explain the large glitches since the change of the pinning site distance more than an order of magnitude is less likely .",
    "we need to conduct the three dimensional calculations in order to understand the equilibrium configuration and pinning strength accurately for various orientations of crystal lattice as well as for large magnus forces .",
    "let us now consider the oscillations excited on and propagate along the vortex line @xcite . in order to examine oscillations of small amplitude about equilibrium",
    ", we write @xmath109 and @xmath110 where the subscripts @xmath111 and @xmath112 denote the equilibrium solutions and the perturbations , respectively . using equations ( [ eq : phi1 ] ) and ( [ eq : psi1 ] ) , we linearize equations ( [ eq : eqmot1 ] ) and ( [ eq : eqmot2 ] ) and obtain @xmath113 and @xmath114 we consider plane - wave solutions @xmath115 for @xmath116 and @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is the angular frequency and @xmath119 is the wave number .",
    "then , we derive the dispersion relation for oscillations , @xmath120 if we adopt such solutions as @xmath121 for equilibrium , from equation ( [ eq : disp ] ) we obtain the dispersion relation simplified as @xmath122    next , we examine the property of oscillations represented by the dispersion relation ( [ eq : disp2 ] ) . the first term in the dispersion relation ( [ eq : disp2 ] ) can be derived when in equations ( [ eq : pert1 ] ) and ( [ eq : pert2 ] ) we include only the second and third terms ( the magnus and tension terms ) ignoring the first term ( the pinning term ) .",
    "hence , the first term in the dispersion relation ( [ eq : disp2 ] ) expresses the kelvin wave , which is circularly polarized and propagates helically along a vortex line @xcite . the second term in the dispersion relation ( [ eq : disp2 ] ) can be derived when in equations ( [ eq : pert1 ] ) and ( [ eq : pert2 ] ) we include only the first and second terms ( the pinning and magnus terms ) neglecting the third term ( the tension term ) .",
    "we find that the second term in the dispersion relation expresses the circular motion of a vortex line as a whole around the equilibrium position .",
    "in general the dispersion relation ( [ eq : disp2 ] ) represents the combined oscillations of kelvin and rotational modes .",
    "figure [ disp ] illustrates the dispersion relation given by equation ( [ eq : disp2 ] ) for different @xmath123 .",
    "the angular frequency of allowed oscillations is plotted as a function of wave number . at smaller wave numbers the angular frequency of oscillations",
    "is determined mainly by the rotational mode , while at larger wave numbers mainly by the kelvin mode .",
    "we should note that there exists the minimum frequency for the oscillations especially when @xmath123 is close to @xmath124 .",
    "the minimum frequency for @xmath125 is @xmath126 which yields @xmath127 at densities of @xmath88 and @xmath128 at densities of @xmath129 .",
    "@xmath130 in the pinned segments , where the vortex line lies deep in the pinning potential well . on the other hand , at the kink segments where @xmath131 , the minimum frequency is zero .",
    "these results lead to the important conclusion that the vortex oscillations with frequencies lower than the minimum frequency , @xmath132 , can not be excited on and can not propagate in the pinned part of a vortex line , whereas oscillations with frequencies higher than the minimum can propagate along a vortex line , varying the wave length .",
    "the vortex oscillations with lower frequencies are allowed in the kink part of a vortex line .",
    "we should note , however , that the dispersion relation ( [ eq : disp2 ] ) in the kink part is less reliable for lower frequencies since the wave length exceeds the kink length and hence the local perturbation analysis is not adequate .",
    "we need to conduct the non - local analyses for the accurate dispersion relation in low frequencies .    in a polycrystalline structure",
    "the vortex line passes through a number of single crystals with various orientations .",
    "the local perturbation analysis can be applied to each single crystal to examine the vortex oscillations .",
    "equations ( [ eq : disp2 ] ) and ( [ eq : wmin ] ) may also be derived for each single crystal , although the physical parameters in one domain differ from those in another .",
    "we can expect the physical parameters to change rather sharply at the boundaries between the single crystals .",
    "if the frequencies are sufficiently high above the minimum frequencies , the oscillations will propagate along a vortex line passing through many single crystals .",
    "if the frequencies are around the minimum frequencies , the oscillations are reflected at the boundaries and in some cases will be trapped within one crystal or some .",
    "if the frequencies are lower than the minimum frequencies , there may be no oscillations which propagate over a number of single crystals .",
    "it has been considered that pulsar glitches are a consequence of the large scale unpinning of superfluid neutron vortices from the lattice nuclei in the inner crust of neutron stars .",
    "recently , however , jones ( 1997 , 1998 , 1999 ) argues that vortex interaction with a polycrystalline structure does not provide pinning strong enough to explain the large glitches observed in the vela pulsar .",
    "let us examine this conclusion in the light of our new results mentioned in the previous sections .",
    "jones describes the reason for the conclusion that the structural regularity of a defect - free single crystal allows displacement of a vortex , under a magnus force , to a continuous sequence of new positions with no more than extremely small changes in energy .",
    "furthermore , jones considers the motion of kinks propagating along a vortex line with a velocity of @xmath133 . for simplicity",
    "we consider the vortex lines which have kinks bent in the y - direction and extend approximately in the z - direction .",
    "the kink propagation along a vortex line yields a displacement and hence motion of the vortex line in the y - direction . if the kink propagation velocity is @xmath134 the time average of a vortex velocity in the y - direction is equal to the superfluid velocity @xcite . in effect , vortex lines move in the y - direction together with the superfluid , almost not suffering from pinning .",
    "these energy and velocity arguments lead jones to the above conclusion that pinning would be extremely weak and insufficient for the large glitches .",
    "we point out several difficulties included in these arguments .",
    "kinks should be created and supplied around the edge of a single crystal at a rate of one kink every @xmath135 seconds in order for a vortex line to move steadily together with superfluid .",
    "the kink supply rate required just before the glitches in the vela pulsar is @xmath136 .",
    "this rate is much lower than the minimum frequency ( equation ( [ eq : wmin ] ) ) of oscillations which can be excited in the pinned part of a vortex line .",
    "hence , the oscillations of vortex lines can not be a direct cause for the creation and supply of kinks .",
    "moreover , energy of @xmath87 ( equation ( [ eq : et ] ) ) , which is substantially larger than the thermal energy , is needed locally to form a kink .",
    "energy source for kink formation is also pointed out as a difficulty included in the kink propagation model .",
    "we note that the kink solution ( [ eq : kink ] ) can also be expressed as a sum of fourier components of different wave numbers . as seen from the dispersion relation ( [ eq : disp2 ] ) , the phase velocity of a vortex wave depends on wave number .",
    "the vortex waves with different wave numbers propagate with different phase velocities .",
    "hence , even if a kink is formed around the end of a single crystal , the kink feature will be smeared out during propagation .",
    "furthermore , our perturbation analyses show that the vortex configurations with static kink structures are stable .",
    "these facts indicate that the kink motion following equation ( [ eq : vk ] ) is less likely .",
    "if the kinks do not move along a vortex line with the velocity given by equation ( [ eq : vk ] ) , the conclusion by jones is not guaranteed .",
    "we show in the previous sections that the vortex equilibrium configuration is in general composed of the static kink and straight segments .",
    "a vortex line in equilibrium lies deep in the pinning potential well and is strongly pinned to the lattice nuclei in its most part except for the kink part . from the perturbation analyses we find no unstable mode that grows with time for the pinned equilibrium configurations both with and without kinks .",
    "the pinned equilibrium configurations , though oscillations can be excited , may be stable . hence , the static kink is a stable structure .",
    "our studies show that strong pinning of vortex lines is likely to occur especially when the average direction of a vortex line is parallel or approximately parallel to the major axis of a crystal lattice and the magnus force is not so strong .",
    "the orientation of a crystal lattice varies from one domain to another in a polycrystalline structure .",
    "the pinning strength decreases in the domain where the major axis of a crystal lattice is not close to the vortex line .",
    "however , as long as the equilibrium vortex configurations are represented by the kink solutions , pinning of a vortex line in a polycrystalline structure would be still strong enough to explain the large glitches ( see the subsection 3.7 ) .",
    "we have shown that the equilibrium configuration of a vortex line consists of straight and kink parts when the rotation axis of the star is approximately aligned with the major axis of a crystal lattice and the magnus force is weak .",
    "the straight part is much longer than the kink part .",
    "furthermore , the straight parts pass through nearly all of nuclei along the major axis , whereas the kink parts lie mostly in space between the lattice planes .",
    "the vortex line is strongly pinned to the lattice nuclei in the straight part , while not in the kink part .",
    "we have found from the perturbation analyses that there exist two modes , rotational and helical ( kelvin ) , for oscillations excited on a vortex line .",
    "the vortex oscillations are possible only above a minimum frequency @xcite and the phase velocity of oscillations varies with wave number .",
    "we find no unstable mode that grows with time .",
    "these facts lead to the conclusion that the vortex configuration with kinks may be stable and yield the strongly pinned state especially when the vortex line is close to the main axis of a crystal lattice .",
    "jones ( 1997 , 1998 ) argues that pinning is not strong enough to explain the large glitches adopting a kink motion in a polycrystalline structure .",
    "our studies show that the static kink is a stable structure and the kink motion is less likely . if the kinks do not move along a vortex line , the conclusion made by jones is not guaranteed .",
    "nuclei in the crust may be in a polycrystalline structure .",
    "the orientation of a crystal lattice varies from one domain to another .",
    "the pinning strength decreases in the domain where the major axis of a crystal lattice is not close to the vortex line . however ,",
    "as long as the equilibrium vortex configurations are represented by the kink solutions , pinning of a vortex line in a polycrystalline structure would be still strong enough to explain the large glitches .",
    "we have shown that the magnus force makes the vortex line parabolic on global scale and causes it to incline against the major axis of a crystal lattice .",
    "as the magnus force increases and the rotation axis inclines against the major axis of a crystal lattice , we need to include the major axis components for force and displacement , though neglected in the present study .",
    "we expect that the lattice planes different from those considered here may become important for pinning .",
    "the pinning sites are discrete although we have assumed the uniform pinning potential along the major axis of a crystal lattice .",
    "link , epstein and baym ( 1993 ) find that there appears the band structure in the energy spectrum for excitations on a vortex line when the discrete nature is included in the pinning site distribution .",
    "it is also necessary to take account of the discrete nature of the pinning sites when we consider the vortex equilibrium configurations with the scale length comparable to the lattice constant .",
    "the above arguments suggest that the three dimensional calculations adopting the discrete pinning sites should be conducted in near future in order to understand the equilibrium vortex configurations and vortex oscillations and judge the relevance of vortex pinning for the pulsar glitches correctly .",
