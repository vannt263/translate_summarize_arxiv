    "the subject of this paper is the motion of linked rigid bodies moving in a weakly compressible , viscous fluid .",
    "it is closely connected with mathematical and computational studies of the swimming of fish , and with the motion of underwater vehicles and robotic fish propelled by changes of shape .",
    "our approach is primarily computational using the sph algorithms of kajtar and monaghan ( 2008 ) to establish scaling relations for the motion .",
    "the work is closely related to recent work on the motion of linked bodies in an infinite , two dimensional fluid which may be inviscid ( kanso et al . , 2005 , melli et al . , 2006 ) or viscous ( eldredge , 2006 , 2007 , 2008 ) . when the fluid is inviscid it is possible to bring powerful mathematical formalisms to bear on the problem in a manner similar to the motion of a single body in an inviscid fluid ( see for example lamb , 1932 ) .",
    "however , for problems involving free surfaces , or complicated rigid boundaries , or a stratified fluid , these methods become very complicated .",
    "our approach is capable of handling arbitrary body shapes and boundaries though in the present paper we concentrate on motion of linked ellipses moving in a periodic domain .",
    "the sph method also has advantages over the vortex particle method of eldredge ( 2006 ) for problems where the bodies penetrate a free surface , but in the present case no such difficulties exist and the vortex particle method provides a convenient comparison for the sph calculations .",
    "the bodies we consider are solid bodies linked by virtual rods which join at pivot points .",
    "the rods are described as virtual because they do not have any mechanical function except to define the direction of fixed lines in the bodies . in particular",
    ", fluid can flow between the ellipses .",
    "the angles between the rods ( and therefore the bodies ) are specified as an oscillating function of time .",
    "a specification of the time variation of these angles is called the gait .",
    "our aim is to determine the scaling relations which relate the speed and power developed by the linked bodies to the frequency and amplitude of a standard gait which propels the linked bodies along a path which is , on average , a straight line .",
    "a related problem was considered by taylor ( 1952 ) who studied the motion of a long slender body and applied his results to the motion of a leech and a snake moving in water .",
    "our three ellipse system has a motion which is similar to that of the leech and snake because their oscillations are are roughly sinusoidal , and are therefore not too different from the oscillations of our connected ellipses .",
    "taylor s analysis provides a remarkably accurate guide for the functional form of the dependence of the velocity and power of our three ellipse system on the frequency and amplitude of the gait .",
    "the plan of the paper is to first discuss the sph algorithm .",
    "we then show by convergence studies that a periodic domain can be used to represent the infinite domain with errors that are typically @xmath0 .",
    "we also establish convergence with resolution .",
    "we first compare our results with the viscous results of eldredge ( 2008 ) for massless bodies by a series of simulations with decreasing body mass .",
    "the agreement is very satisfactory .",
    "we then compare our results to the inviscid results of kanso et al .",
    "2005 by changing the viscosity so that the reynolds number varies from 50 to 5000 .",
    "this comparison shows that the sph results converge to the inviscid results for the highest reynolds number .",
    "we then discuss scaling relations for the velocity and power output , and relate them to taylor s ( 1952 ) analytical relations for the velocity and power output of long narrow animals swimming .",
    "we apply these results to the swimming of a leech .",
    "finally we determine the minimum power , and corresponding gait , required to propel the bodies at a specified average speed . throughout this paper",
    "we use si units .",
    "we consider motion in two dimensions and use cartesian coordinates .",
    "a typical configuration of the bodies is shown in figure [ fig : bodyangles ] .",
    "the motion of the fluid , which is assumed incompressible , is specified by the navier stokes equations . in cartesian tensor form these equations are @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes the number of bodies , @xmath3 is the stress tensor @xmath4 @xmath5 is the pressure and @xmath6 the shear viscosity coefficient .",
    "the function @xmath7 is a one dimensional delta function , and @xmath8 is the perpendicular distance from the surface @xmath9 of body @xmath10 to the position where the fluid acceleration is required . the unit vector @xmath11 is directed from body @xmath10 into the fluid .",
    "the introduction of forces into the acceleration equation ( [ eqn : navierstokes ] ) as an alternative to specifying boundary conditions on the velocity is due to sirovich ( 1967 , 1968 ) . in his formulation , as in ours , @xmath12 is a delta function defined so that for any quantity @xmath13 @xmath14 where the first integral is over the volume and the second integral is over the surface . in this way a volume integral involving a delta function becomes equivalent to a surface integral , and the body force per unit volume in ( [ eqn : navierstokes ] ) becomes a force per unit area .",
    "this force provides both the pressure which prevents penetration of the rigid body , and the viscous traction term .",
    "it mimics the fundamental molecular basis of the boundary conditions namely that the atoms of the fluid do not penetrate the atoms of the solid because of the atomic forces between the liquid and the solid atoms .",
    "a closely related method of using boundary forces is due to peskin ( 1977 ) who simulated elastic membranes such as the heart interacting with a fluid .",
    "peskin s equations ( 2.3 ) to ( 2.6 ) are essentially those of sirovich , though the peskin deals with an elastic material and sirovich assumes the body is rigid",
    ". further details about peskin s formulation can be found in peskin ( 2002 ) .",
    "we denote an element of area on the surface of body @xmath10 by @xmath15 .",
    "the motion of the centre of mass @xmath16 of solid body @xmath10 ( with mass @xmath17 ) is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the force due to the constraints .",
    "the rotation of rigid body @xmath10 , with moment of inertia @xmath20 ) , is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a vector from the centre of mass of body @xmath10 to the element of area @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the force on the element of area , and @xmath25 ) is the constraint torque on body @xmath10 .    in the following , to simplify the notation , the subscript @xmath10 will always denote the label of a body .",
    "thus , for example , @xmath16 will be replaced by @xmath26 .",
    "the angle @xmath27 which fixes the rotation of body @xmath10 is defined as the positive rotation of a line fixed in the body from the @xmath28 axis of a cartesian coordinate system fixed in space . for simplicity",
    "we assume the line fixed in the body is an axis of symmetry .",
    "the constraint conditions on the angles are @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the link number and @xmath31 is a specified function .",
    "the form of the @xmath31 determines the gait of the bodies . for the examples we consider here there are three bodies and two links as shown in figure [ fig : bodyangles ] . in the simplest case @xmath31",
    "is a function of @xmath32 but , in general , it depends on other variables .",
    "for example , in a biological problem , it could depend on the centre of mass coordinates in such a way that the fish slows down when it enters a region where food is abundant .",
    "in addition to the constraints on the angles there are constraints associated with the links .",
    "we assume the link , or pivot , is at a distance @xmath33 from the centre of mass of body @xmath10 .",
    "the condition on the @xmath34 components of the centres of mass of bodies @xmath10 and @xmath35 is that the @xmath34 coordinate of the link between them is given by @xmath36 or @xmath37 similarly the @xmath38 constraint is @xmath39 these constraints enable the coordinates of the centres of mass of the bodies , and their angles @xmath40 to be written in terms of those of any selected body .",
    "similarly , by differentiating the constraint conditions with respect to time , the velocities @xmath41 and @xmath42 and angular velocity @xmath43 of the bodies can be written as functions of the same selected body .",
    "the number of degrees of freedom ( coordinates and velocities ) of @xmath44 linked bodies in two dimensions is therefore 6 compared with the @xmath45 degrees of freedom of @xmath44 independent bodies in two dimensions . if the @xmath31 are functions of @xmath32 alone it is possible to reduce the equations of motion to those involving the coordinates and velocities of one of the bodies .",
    "this can also be done when the @xmath31 are functions of both coordinates and time but it is inconvenient to eliminate variables and , in our view , simpler to take account of the constraints by using lagrange multipliers .",
    "for that reason we use lagrange multipliers even though , in the applications to be described in this paper , the @xmath31 are functions of @xmath32 only .    for the case of three bodies we have two links and therefore 6 constraints .",
    "we denote the lagrange multipliers for the @xmath34 , @xmath38 and @xmath40 constraints of link @xmath30 by @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively . using standard methods for holonomic constraints ( e.g. landau and lifshitz , 1976 )",
    "we find the following expressions for the constraint forces @xmath49 and torques @xmath50 for the various bodies .",
    "for body 1 @xmath51 for body 2 @xmath52 and for body 3 @xmath53 these constraint forces do not affect the total linear momentum of the bodies because they sum to zero .",
    "the constraint torque on body 1 is @xmath54 on body 2 it is @xmath55 and on body 3 it is @xmath56    the constraint forces and torques are provided by the engines which drive the angular variation between the bodies . in the case of fish",
    "these engines are the muscles of their bodies and the work done is provided by the internal chemical energy generated by the fish . the way these constraint forces and torques affect the angular momentum will be discussed in @xmath57 .",
    "the form of the sph equations that we use is discussed in more detail by monaghan ( 1992 , 2005 ) . for the liquid sph particles the acceleration equation is @xmath58.\\ ] ] in this equation",
    "the mass , position , velocity , density , and pressure of particle @xmath59 are @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 respectively .",

    "is the fourth degree wendland kernel for two dimensions ( wendland , 1995 ) , and has support @xmath69 . in the present calculations the @xmath70 used in @xmath65 is an average @xmath71 .",
    "the choice of @xmath72 is discussed in detail by monaghan ( 1992 , 2005 ) . in this paper",
    "we choose @xmath72 to be 1.5 times the initial particle spacing so that the interaction between any two fluid particles is zero beyond 3 initial particle spacings .",
    "the first summation in ( [ eqn : sphaccel ] ) is over all fluid particles and is the sph equivalent of the first term on the right hand side of ( [ eqn : navierstokes ] ) .",
    "the last term in ( [ eqn : sphaccel ] ) is the contribution to the force per unit mass on fluid particle @xmath59 due to boundary particles and is equivalent to the last term in ( [ eqn : navierstokes ] ) .",
    "a body label is denoted by @xmath10 , and @xmath73 is one of the set of boundary particle labels on body @xmath10 .",
    "the term @xmath74 is the non - viscous boundary particle force per unit mass on fluid particle @xmath59 due to boundary particle @xmath75 . in the present paper",
    "we use the boundary forces analysed by monaghan and kajtar ( 2009 ) .",
    "the force @xmath74 acts on the line joining particle @xmath59 and @xmath75 .",
    "the boundary particles delineate the boundaries , and produce forces on the fluid in a similar manner to the delta function forces of sirovich discussed after ( [ eqn : stresstensor ] ) .",
    "the viscosity is determined by @xmath76 for which we choose the form ( monaghan 1997 , 2005 ) @xmath77 in this expression @xmath78 is a constant , and the notation @xmath79 is used .",
    "@xmath80 denotes the average density @xmath81 .",
    "we take the signal velocity to be @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the speed of sound at particle @xmath59 ( monaghan , 1997 , though here we take @xmath84 to be half used in that paper and @xmath85 is therefore a factor 2 larger ) .",
    "@xmath84 is dominated by the terms involving the speed of sound .",
    "the kinematic viscosity can be estimated by taking the continuum limit which is equivalent to letting the number of particles go to infinity while keeping the resolution length @xmath72 constant . by a calculation similar to that in monaghan ( 2005 )",
    "it is found that the kinematic viscosity for the wendland kernel is given by @xmath86 sph calculations for shear flow agree very closely with theoretical results using this kinematic viscosity ( monaghan , 2006 ) .",
    "the pressure is given by @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the reference density of the fluid .",
    "to ensure the flow has a sufficiently low mach number to approximate a constant density fluid accurately , we determine the speed of sound by @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the maximum speed of the fluid relative to the bodies . in this case",
    "@xmath84 is dominated by the first two terms .",
    "the precise value of @xmath83 will be specified for each simulation .",
    "the form of the sph continuity equation we use here is @xmath91 and the position of any fluid particle @xmath59 is found by integrating @xmath92    in the present simulations the liquid sph particles were initially placed on a grid of squares and thereafter allowed to move in response to the forces .",
    "the time stepping of the sph equations uses an algorithm which is symplectic in the absence of dissipation .",
    "the details of this scheme are given by kajtar and monaghan ( 2008 ) .",
    "the non - viscous force on boundary particle @xmath75 due to all fluid particles is @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the force per unit mass on boundary particle @xmath75 due to fluid particle @xmath59 .",
    "the viscous force is @xmath95 where we have used the fact that @xmath96 .",
    "the total force on particle @xmath75 is @xmath97    the equation for the centre of mass motion of body @xmath10 is then @xmath98 and the torque equation is @xmath99    the motion of a boundary particle can be determined from the motion of centre of mass and the rotation about the centre of mass .",
    "thus for particle @xmath75 on body @xmath10 , @xmath100 where , in this two dimensional problem , the rotation is around the @xmath101 axis which is perpendicular to the plane of the motion .",
    "the total rate of change of the linear momentum of the rigid bodies with respect to time is @xmath102\\ ] ] where , as noted earlier , the sum over the constraint forces is zero .",
    "the rate of change of linear momentum of the fluid sph particles is given by @xmath103.\\ ] ] noting that the sum over the pressure and viscous forces between fluid particles vanishes because of symmetry .",
    "recalling that @xmath104 we deduce that @xmath105 which shows that the linear momentum @xmath106 is conserved .",
    "the angular momentum of the bodies is composed of the centre of mass angular momentum about some fixed origin , and the sum over each body of the spin angular momentum about the centre of mass of body .",
    "the time rate of change of the total centre of mass angular momentum is @xmath107 the rate of change of the spin angular momentum is @xmath108 the rate of change of the angular momentum of the fluid particles is @xmath109,\\ ] ] where , because of symmetry , the sum over pressure , and viscous terms between fluid particles have vanished .",
    "the rate of change of the total angular momentum ( the sum of ( [ eqn : bodangmom ] ) , ( [ eqn : spinangmom ] ) and ( [ eqn : fluidangmom ] ) ) becomes @xmath110 the first term vanishes because the boundary forces are radial and the last four terms vanish because of the constraint conditions ( [ eqn : xcons ] ) and ( [ eqn : ycons ] ) .    finally we note that the previous arguments about conservation assume the time derivatives are exact .",
    "the actual conservation in the numerical simulations depends on the form of the time stepping algorithm .",
    "linear momentum is always conserved to round off error , but the angular momentum conservation is less accurate because the lagrange multipliers are calculated at the mid - point . in our simulations we use periodic boundaries and",
    "these do not conserve angular momentum exactly . a detailed discussion of the conservation of angular momentum is given by kajtar and monaghan ( 2008 ) .",
    "the sph equations can be applied to the linked bodies moving in a channel , as is the case for many laboratory experiments on fish , or in a pond with an irregular boundary , by replacing the boundaries of the pond by boundary force particles as we have done for the rigid bodies .",
    "the sph algorithm does not need to be changed if the linked bodies move through and out of a free surface , which would be required to mimic the motion of dolphins .",
    "this facility was used earlier for bodies hitting the water ( monaghan and kos , 2000 , monaghan et al . , 2003 ) .",
    "in the present paper , where we compare our results with those of kanso et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and eldredge ( 2008 ) , we need to deal with an infinite medium .",
    "this can not be done directly because it would require infinitely many particles .",
    "one alternative , and the simplest , is to replace fluids of infinite extent by periodic boundary conditions .",
    "these boundaries alter the solutions of the differential equations but the effects are small if the periodic cells are sufficiently large .",
    "we determine their effect by carrying out test calculations for successively larger domains .",
    "we consider ellipses moving with the gait @xmath111 where throughout this section , we set @xmath112 and @xmath113 . the ellipses have semi - major axis @xmath114 , semi - minor axis @xmath115 , and distance between the tip of the ellipse and the pivot @xmath116 .",
    "these dimensions , and the gait , are identical to those of kanso et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and eldredge ( 2008 ) but we use a different notation for the angles . the configuration of the ellipses is shown in figure [ fig : linkbodymotion ] at intervals of 1/3 of a period .",
    "we define the reynolds number @xmath117 by using the characteristic velocity @xmath118 and the characteristic length scale @xmath119 , so that @xmath120 the speed of sound @xmath121 , and the boundaries of the ellipses were defined by boundary particles with spacing @xmath122 ( monaghan and kajtar , 2009 ) .",
    "the motion takes place in a domain with periodic rectangular cells .",
    "the motion of the linked bodies is characterised by the path followed by the centre of mass of the middle body .",
    "this path will be referred to as the ` stride path ' .",
    "the gait ( [ eqn : phi1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : phi2 ] ) is oscillatory with period @xmath123 so that the stride path is oscillatory and has the shape of a zig zag .",
    "we refer to the straight line distance between two consecutive lower points of this zig zag , travelled in time @xmath5 , as a ` stride length ' . the results to follow show that the stride length is , in general , not constant , in agreement with the results of eldredge .",
    "kajtar and monaghan ( 2008 ) showed that the sph algorithm gave results in good agreement with experiments for a driven oscillating cylinder , and for cylinders freely oscillating in a channel flow . in this paper",
    "we describe three levels of further tests .",
    "the first of these is concerned with the convergence as the resolution is refined with a fixed periodic cell size , and convergence as the size of the cell is increased with fixed resolution ( @xmath124 and @xmath125 ) .",
    "the latter is to ensure that our comparison with the results of kanso et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and eldredge ( 2008 ) is legitimate .",
    "the second level of tests is concerned with comparisons with the results of eldredge by studying the stride length when the mass of the bodies is reduced and kanso et al . by studying the stride length change as the viscosity coefficient",
    "is increased ( @xmath126 and @xmath127 ) .",
    "the third level of tests shows that the numerical simulations agree with general scaling relations (  7 ) .      throughout this section",
    ", we use a rectangular domain with periodic boundaries aligned with the @xmath28 and @xmath128 axes of a cartesian coordinate system .",
    "the ratio of the lengths of the sides of the domain , the aspect ratio , is 4:3 .",
    "the fluid spans from @xmath129 to @xmath130 along the horizontal axis , and from @xmath131 to @xmath132 in the vertical axis .",
    "the initial coordinates of the centre of mass of the middle body were always @xmath133 .",
    "for the sph simulations the periodic boundaries were implemented by copying rows and columns of fluid particles @xmath134 in width to the opposite boundary , top to bottom , left to right , and vice versa .",
    "this process guarantees that the fluid particles of interest in the rectangular domain get the correct rates of change in each time step .",
    "we ran the calculations for initial particle spacing @xmath135 , 1/40 , 1/50 and 1/60 .",
    "the domain was of size @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "for these tests , the bodies were neutrally buoyant and @xmath138 .",
    "the simulations for each resolution were run for the same time .",
    "the stride paths for the four values of @xmath139 are plotted in figure [ fig : respaths ] .",
    "note that the strides for the lowest resolution ( @xmath135 ) are significantly longer than for the other three finer resolutions .",
    "the paths for @xmath140 , 1/50 and 1/60 lie almost on top of one another although , because of the slight differences in average velocity , the differences increase with time and we note that the convergence is not monotonic i.e. the results for @xmath141 are closer to those for @xmath142 than are those for @xmath143 .",
    "however , for the three smallest resolutions the relative difference between a stride length of one resolution and another is at most 5% ( for the third stride ) .",
    "figure [ fig : respaths ] also shows that the direction of the path is not sensitive to the resolution .",
    "the results of this numerical test indicate that a fluid particle resolution of @xmath140 is sufficiently accurate to determine the stride path in length and direction to within 5% .    .",

    "the agreement is remarkable because there are significant differences between the inviscid and non - inviscid cases .",
    "for example the flow produced by an oscillating cylinder changes dramatically as the reynolds number changes from small @xmath172 to large @xmath173 though the time averaged drag terms are nearly constant for @xmath174 . in the inviscid case the fluid motion produced by a system of oscillating linked bodies will cease the instant they stop oscillating , while in the viscous case , the motion will continue though it will be damped . and as discussed in the previous section , the strides increase in length both for our calculations and those of eldredge whereas those of kanso et al .",
    "are constant .",
    "these results suggest that when @xmath175 the average motion of the linked bodies is determined primarily by added mass effects as discussed by saffman ( 1967 ) for swimming by shape change in an inviscid fluid .",
    "the stride lengths plotted in figure [ fig : kanso - comp ] were calculated as described in the last section .",
    "in addition to the sph calculations we have plotted in figure [ fig : kanso - comp ] an estimate of the variation of the stride length with viscosity based on an analytical result obtained by taylor ( 1952 ) in his discussion of the swimming of long slender bodies .",

    "we neglect contributions from this quantity .",
    "the speed of the linked bodies , @xmath90 , was estimated from the stride length divided by the time taken to complete the stride . following the approach from the previous section , we take the stride length to be the average of the second and third strides .",

    "it might be thought that this agreement is a lucky coincidence but , taken with the agreement of our results with formulae modelled on taylor s expression , it does suggest that the speed of a three dimensional long thin body is similar in form to that of three linked , long , thin ellipses in two dimensions .",
    "we now ask the question : for a given fluid viscosity , body size and body mass configuration , what is the frequency and amplitude to move with a given speed , while expending the least power ?",

    "it is clear from figure [ fig : optmotioncontours ] that there is a set of values of @xmath189 and @xmath179 which will give a specified speed with minimum power .",

    "it is interesting to note that the optimal motion is close to @xmath283 regardless of the frequency .",
    "we can estimate some properties of the contours in figure [ fig : optmotioncontours ] without detailed numerical calculations . for constant viscosity",

    "these expressions show that @xmath179 increases faster as @xmath189 decreases for the constant @xmath281 curves than for the constant @xmath90 curves when @xmath291 .",
    "this gives the shape of the contours on the left hand side of figure [ fig : optmotioncontours ] .",
    "the principal results of this paper are ( a ) that the accuracy of the sph algorithm for linked bodies moving in a fluid has been established , ( b ) that the variation of the calculated speed and power output take simple forms consistent with scaling relations , ( c ) that there is remarkable agreement between the two dimensional results and those taylor obtained for the swimming of long narrow animals in three dimensions , and ( d ) the minimum power to produce a specified speed for a given gait has been calculated and forms a basis for other such calculations .",

    "the relevant results are limits of our calculations . in the case of eldredge",
    "we estimated his value from a series of calculations where the mass of the body was changed . in the case of kanso",
    "the viscosity was steadily decreased so that the reynolds number increased from 50 to 5000 .",
    "the second and third results were obtained by fixing the dimensions of the bodies and their masses but changing the frequency and amplitude of the gait .",
    "the simulations show that the the results have a simple dependence on frequency and amplitude which is similar to that found by taylor ( 1952 ) .",
    "these results suggest that the drag forces on a long thin ellipse in two dimensions is similar to that on a cylinder in three dimensions .",
    "in particular , it suggests that the drag has two additive contributions .",
    "one varying with reynolds number as @xmath292 and one depending on the square of the velocity relative to the fluid .",
    "we are unaware of calculations or analysis which would confirm this conjecture in detail .",
    "it is clear however , that there will be pressure forces proportional to the square of the velocity on the bodies , and viscous forces due to flow along and between the ellipses .",
    "the result ( d ) shows that the efficiency is poor if the linked bodies are driven with a gait amplitude which is too large or too small .",
    "we find that the optimum performance occurs when the amplitude @xmath293 or , equivalently , when the angles between the links varies between @xmath294 .",
    "the formulation we have used is general and can be immediately applied to the motion of linked bodies in stratified fluids , or with a free surface , or within complex boundaries , or with more complex constraints including those where the gait depends on the positions of the bodies in the domain .",
