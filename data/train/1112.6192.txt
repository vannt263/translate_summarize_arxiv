    "ever since 1900 , quantum theories ( quantum mechanics and quantum field theory ) and the theories of relativity ( special and general relativity ) are the most significant achievements in physics . however , for more than 100 years , the compatiblity of these two categories of theories is still a problem .",
    "needless to say the conflict in spirit , only the obstacle in technique passing from general relativity to quantum theory has been enough problematic .    in the process of seeking for a theory of quantum gravity , there is the effort to establish qft in curved spacetime@xcite , assuming that the gravitational fields are dominated by a classical theory ( typically by general relativity ) .",
    "the classical background may or may not be affected by the quantum fields . currently the qft in curved spacetime is mainly a framework generalized from the qft in the minkowski spacetime .",
    "difference between a generic curved spacetime and the minkowski spacetime has been considered , but , without much detailed knowledge of classical solutions of field theories in curved spacetime , some key points in qft in curved spacetimes are inevitable questionable .    for a similar example , let us examine what happens when we consider scalar fields in @xmath5-dimensional toy spacetimes . if the spacetime is a minkowski spacetime , scalar fields on it can be analyzed using the fourier transform with respect to the spatial direction .",
    "if the space is closed as the circle @xmath6 , however , scalar fields turn out to be fourier series with respect to the spatial direction . in such an example",
    ", we can see how the difference of topologies could make great influence on the analysis tools .    given a curved spacetime ,",
    "its topological structure and geometric structure may affect many aspects of the fields .",
    "for a linear field equation , for instance , whether its solution space is infinite dimensional , whether some parameters ( such as the mass ) of the field equations are restricted to take only some special values , and so on , all depend on these structures .",
    "the qft in curved spacetime must take these aspects into account .    in this paper ,",
    "we take the klein - gordon equation on the 4-dimensional de  sitter spacetime ( denoted by @xmath7 in this paper ) as an example . applying the representation theory of semisimple lie algebras ,",
    "we can obtain _ all smooth classical solutions _ of the klein - gordon equation on @xmath7 .",
    "it is clear that , unlike the case of the minkowski spacetime , the solution space of the k - g equation on @xmath7 is finite dimensional .",
    "what s more important is that the mass of a klein - gordon equation on @xmath7 can not be continuously real - valued .",
    "in fact , there exists nonzero solutions when and only when the mass @xmath2 satisfies @xmath8 for certain a nonnegative integer @xmath9 , with @xmath10 the `` radius '' of @xmath7 . in the quantization process",
    ", the negative sign in @xmath11 should be a great obstacle to interpret @xmath2 to be the mass of particles excited by quantum scalar fields .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [",
    "sect : outline ] we outline our idea of how to obtain all smooth solutions of the klein - gordon equation on @xmath7 .",
    "we start the outline from the well know theory of angular momentum in quantum mechanics . in section  [",
    "sect : prog ] we describe the whole principle and program of our method . in section  [",
    "sect : lie - alg ] we apply the theory of semisimple lie algebras to @xmath12 , the complexification of @xmath13 , and describe its algebraic structures which have nothing to do with its representations . for convenience @xmath12",
    "is denoted by @xmath14 . in section  [",
    "sect : irred - modules ] we apply the representation theory of semisimple lie algebras to the @xmath14-module @xmath15 , analogous to the coordinate representation of angular momentum operators in quantum mechanics . in this section",
    "we give some coordinate systems adapted to the cartan subalgebras of @xmath14 , and construct irreducible @xmath14-submodules of @xmath15 . in section  [",
    "sect : solution - mass ] we give the mass of the klein - gordon equation and its smooth solutions .",
    "then , finally , in section  [ sect : cd ] , we give the summary and discuss some related problems . detailed investigation and proofs",
    "are left in the appendices .",
    "in general relativity , the klein - gordon equation reads @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the levi - civita connection .",
    "( indices like @xmath18 and @xmath19 are abstract indices  @xcite . ) in this paper the signature of the metric tensor field @xmath20 is like that of @xmath21    the klein - gordon equation is a linear pde . to solve a pde ,",
    "one often applies the method of separation of variables .",
    "however , whether this method works depends heavily on the choice of the coordinates @xmath22 .",
    "if one is not so lucky to choose the right coordinates , this method would fail even if the pde can be easily solved in certain a right coordinate system .    in order to solve a linear pde using the method of separation of variables",
    ", we must choose a coordinate system that is closely related to the symmetry of the pde .",
    "when the symmetry group is a lie group with a sufficient large rank ( the dimension of its cartan subgroup ) , it is even possible to solve the pde by virtue of the theory of lie groups and lie algebras . in this case",
    "the method of separation of variables is only needed to find out a maximal vector@xcite corresponding to the highest weight .",
    "after the maximal vectors have been found out , the solution space of the pde can be easily , but often tediously , constructed .    to show this",
    ", we take the equation @xmath23 on @xmath24 ( the unit 2-sphere ) as an example , where @xmath25 is the levi - civita connection compatible with the standard metric tensor field @xmath26 on @xmath27 .",
    "this is the eigenvalue equation of the laplacian operator for 0-forms on @xmath24 . since the symmetry group of @xmath24 is @xmath28 , and since eq .",
    "( [ eigen - eq : laplace : s2 ] ) is determined by the metric tensor field @xmath29 , the symmetry group of eq .",
    "( [ eigen - eq : laplace : s2 ] ) contains @xmath28 as a lie subgroup . in the spherical coordinate system @xmath30 , eq .",
    "( [ eigen - eq : laplace : s2 ] ) takes the well known form @xmath31    on the one hand , this pde arises from the helmholtz equation by separation of variable , and a further separation of variable leads to the general legendre equation , together with the equation of a simple harmonic oscillator with respect to the variable @xmath32 . as a result , the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : laplace - s2 ] ) , namely , eq .  ( [ eigen - eq : laplace : s2 ] ) , is a linear combination @xmath33 of spherical harmonics @xmath34 with a fixed nonnegative integer @xmath10 , where @xmath35 are arbitrary constants , and @xmath36 .    on the other hand , in quantum mechanics , there is a more elegant method using the theory of angular momentum operators to solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : laplace - s2 ] ) . in geometry ,",
    "the angular momentum operators @xmath37 are proportional to three killing vector fields @xmath38 respectively .",
    "to apply the theory of angular momentum operators to the coordinate representation is , in fact , equivalent to apply the representation theory of @xmath39 to @xmath40 , the @xmath39-module of all smooth functions on @xmath24 . in this manner @xmath41 , which acts as the maximal vector in the representation theory , can be obtained by solving two pdes of order one : @xmath42 then all other @xmath34 can be obtained from @xmath43 for @xmath44 , @xmath45 ,  , @xmath46 recursively .",
    "it is well known that eq .",
    "( [ eq : laplace - s2 ] ) , namely , eq .  ( [ eigen - eq : laplace : s2 ] ) , is equivalent to @xmath47 and @xmath48 is a casimir operator of @xmath39 . because all @xmath49 with @xmath50 , @xmath51 ,  , @xmath52 span an irreducible @xmath39-module , the linear combination ( [ eq : y : o(3 ) ] ) is automatically a solution of the above equation , according to schur s lemma  @xcite . in order to determine the value of @xmath53 ,",
    "we need simply substitute @xmath54 into the above equation , obtaining @xmath55 .",
    "the reason that separation of variables works is deeply related to the fact that the @xmath56-coordinate curves are integral curves of @xmath57 , which can be easily seen from eq .  ( [ eq : killing-3:s2 ] ) . note that @xmath58 spans a cartan subalgebra of @xmath59 , and that each @xmath49 spans a weight space with respect to this cartan subalgebra .",
    "the above approach is very instructive .",
    "since the de  sitter spacetime and anti - de  sitter spacetime are maximally symmetric , such an approach can be easily applied to field equations in de  sitter or anti - de  sitter backgrounds .    in this paper",
    "we only take the klein - gordon equation on @xmath60 , the 4-dimensional de  sitter spacetime ( as a background ) , as an example .",
    "the main idea can be illustrated as follows .",
    "the symmetry group of @xmath60 is @xmath61 , whose lie algebra @xmath13 induces a lie algebra of killing vector fields on @xmath60 . via these killing vector fields , @xmath13 acts on smooth functions on @xmath60 .",
    "thus @xmath15 , the space of all smooth functions on @xmath60 , is an @xmath13-module .",
    "( equivalently speaking , @xmath15 is a representation space of @xmath13 . )",
    "since the klein - gordon equation on @xmath60 is @xmath61-invariant , its solution space @xmath62 is @xmath61-invariant .",
    "hence @xmath62 is an @xmath13-submodule of @xmath15",
    ". it must be the direct sum of some irreducible @xmath1-submodules .",
    "therefore , to obtain the solution space of the klein - gordon equation on @xmath60 , we must construct these irreducible @xmath13-submodules of @xmath15 .",
    "there is an important fact : the klein - gordon equation on @xmath60 is , in fact , an eigenvalue equation of the casimir element of @xmath13 .",
    "see , eq .",
    "( [ eq : kg : casimir ] ) in this paper . by aid of this fact",
    ", it is very easy to obtain all smooth solutions of the klein - gordon equation in the de  sitter background .",
    "an interesting and important consequence is that the mass in the klein - gordon equation is discrete and imaginary , as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mass - spectrum ] ) .",
    "now we consider the 5-dimensional minkowski space @xmath63 , with @xmath64 ( @xmath65 , @xmath66 ,  , @xmath67 ) the minkowski coordinates on it .",
    "the de  sitter spacetime of radius @xmath68 can be treated as the hypersurface @xmath69 of @xmath70 , where @xmath71 .",
    "the linear group @xmath72 is the symmetry group of @xmath70 , leaving both the line element @xmath73 of @xmath70 and the hypersurface ( [ eq : ds ] ) invariant .",
    "consequently , @xmath72 is also the symmetry group of @xmath0 .    for later usage ,",
    "we describe the symmetries of @xmath0 in some details .",
    "the metric tensor field @xmath74 on @xmath63 induces a metric tensor field @xmath75 on @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , let @xmath76 be the inclusion , then @xmath77 is the pullback of @xmath78 .",
    "a linear transformation @xmath79 on @xmath63 leaves @xmath0 , the hypersurface ( [ eq : ds ] ) , invariant .",
    "thus we may set the restriction of @xmath80 to @xmath0 , @xmath81 , to be a transformation on @xmath60 .",
    "it follows that @xmath82 is a symmetry of @xmath83 .",
    "that is , @xmath82 is a diffeomorphism , satisfying @xmath84 obviously , all @xmath82 with @xmath79 form a group , which is isomorphic to @xmath72 .    in the following we describe the lie algebras of the symmetry group .",
    "first , there are the @xmath85 matrices @xmath86 with @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath66 ,  , @xmath67 , whose @xmath89 entry reads @xmath90 they satisfy @xmath91 and @xmath92    = \\eta_{bc } \\ , x_{ad } + \\eta_{ad } \\ , x_{bc }    - \\eta_{ac } \\ , x_{bd } - \\eta_{bd } \\ , x_{ac }    \\ , .",

    "let @xmath97 be the lie algebra of smooth vector fields on @xmath70 .",
    "then the map @xmath98 , @xmath99 is a homomorphism of lie algebras .",
    "roughly speaking , the above @xmath100 is generated by the infinitesimal transformation corresponding to the matrix @xmath101 .",

    "in fact , if @xmath104 corresponds to @xmath100 , the 1-parameter group @xmath120 is just generated by the vector field @xmath117 .",
