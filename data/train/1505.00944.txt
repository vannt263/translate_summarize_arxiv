    "the polytropic gas model , in which the pressure @xmath1 has a simple power law dependence of the matter energy density @xmath2 , given by @xmath3 , plays an important role in the modelling of self - gravitating systems of compact astrophysical objects , such as white dwarfs and neutron stars , as well as in the study of the equation of state of nuclear matter .",
    "usually the polytropic equation of state is represented as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is called the polytropic index .",
    "the poisson and the hydrostatic equilibrium equations for a self - gravitating , spherically symmetric polytropic fluid can be combined to provide the basic equation describing the equilibrium properties of the system as @xmath6 where the dimensionless quantities @xmath7 and @xmath8 are defined as @xmath9 and @xmath10 , with @xmath11 and @xmath12 the central energy density and pressure , respectively .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) is known as the lane - emden equation , and its physical , astrophysical and mathematical properties have been intensively studied by using both analytical and numerical methods .",
    "it admits only three exact solutions , corresponding to @xmath13 , @xmath0 and @xmath14 , respectively @xcite .    from these three solutions ,",
    "the unusual solution corresponding to @xmath0 , having the form @xmath15 , does not seem at first sight to have many realistic physical properties , and consequently it has been less investigated , as compared to the other solutions .",
    "however , somehow unexpectedly , the @xmath0 polytropic equation of state appears in a fundamental field of research apparently unrelated to astrophysics , namely , the theory of the condensed bose - einstein cold atomic gases .",
    "a basic result in quantum statistical mechanics is that at very low temperatures , in a dilute bosonic system ( bose gas ) all particles condense to the same quantum ground state , forming a so called bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) . from a physical point of view a bec",
    "is characterized by a sharp peak in both coordinate and momentum space distribution .",
    "the bec phase transition takes place when the particles are correlated with each other quantum , mechanically .",
    "this happens when their wavelengths overlap , that is , the thermal de broglie wavelength @xmath16 becomes greater than the mean inter - particles distance @xmath17 .",
    "hence the bec transition occurs at a temperature @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the mass of the particle in the condensate , @xmath5 is the number density , and @xmath20 is boltzmann s constant @xcite-@xcite .",
    "a coherent quantum condensate state develops in two physical situations : a ) when the particle density is high enough , or b ) the system temperature is sufficiently low .",
    "the bose - einstein condensation has been observed in laboratory experiments @xcite .",
    "a large number of quantum degenerate gases have been created by a combination of laser , magnetic and evaporative cooling techniques .",
    "the experimental investigations have opened several new directions of research , involving atomic , statistical and condensed matter physics @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper will be applications of the bec to the dark matter problem .",
    "indeed , the existence of dark matter is primarily supported by the rotation curve of galaxies @xcite , and also by the difference between the masses derived from luminosity and from the virial theorem in clusters of galaxies @xcite .",
    "furthermore , gravitational lensing data also indicates that light deflection is more accentuated than would be to visible matter alone @xcite .",
    "thus , by introducing a new matter component , denoted dark matter , it is possible to explain all of these observational phenomena .",
    "however , the nature of dark matter , and its constituent particle(s ) , still remain essentially unknown , despite several decades of intensive research . for reviews on the dark matter problem",

    "the possibility that dark matter could be in the form of a bose - einstein condensate was analyzed in detail in @xcite ( for earlier work in this field see @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , the equation of state of the condensate dark matter was obtained as a polytropic equation of state of index @xmath0 , and the corresponding density profile was discussed .",
    "the theoretical rotation curves were fitted with the observational data from a sample of low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies , and it was pointed out that the lensing properties may discriminate between the standard pressureless and the condensate dark matter models .",
    "the physical and astrophysical properties of bose - einstein condensate dark matter halos were investigated in @xcite .",
    "recently , the rotation curves in the bose - einstein condensate dark matter model were analyzed in @xcite , and a good agreement with observations was found .",
    "a comparison of the predicted rotation curves with the observational data for eight dwarf galaxies was performed in @xcite , and it was shown that the presence of the condensate dark matter can solve the core / cusp problem faced by the standard @xmath21cdm ( @xmath21cold dark matter ) model .",
    "the effects of the angular momentum and on the vortices on the equilibrium of self - gravitating , rotating bec haloes which satisfy the gross - pitaevskii - poisson equations were considered in @xcite . in a bose - einstein condensate vortices",

    "the galactic masses in the framework of the condensate model were discussed in @xcite , and the effects of the finite temperature of the condensate on the density profiles were studied in har4 .",
    "the equilibrium properties of newtonian self - gravitating bose - einstein condensates with short - range interactions were investigated in detail in @xcite .",
    "the study of the cosmological implications of the bose - einstein condensation has also become an active field of research @xcite . in particular , in @xcite it was shown that condensate dark matter effects can be seen in the cmb matter power spectrum if the mass @xmath22 of the condensate particle lies in the range 15 mev @xmath23 mev , leading to a small , but perceptible , excess of power at large scales .",
    "the possibility of the existence of the bec stars was also considered stars , while bec string models were investigated in @xcite .",
    "one of the central issue in the study of bose - einstein condensate dark matter halos is the nature , and properties , of the dark matter particle .",
    "one of the most interesting dark matter particle candidate is the axion , a ( still ) hypothetical elementary particle postulated by the peccei - quinn theory @xcite to resolve the strong cp problem in quantum chromodynamics .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that dark matter axions do form a bec , as a result either of their self interactions , or as a result of their gravitational interactions .",
    "it was also proven , from the study of the cosmological perturbations , that axion bose - einstein condensate dark matter halos differ from standard cold dark matter ones on small scales only .",
    "unlike vortices in superfluid he@xmath24 and dilute gases , the vortices in the axion bose - einstein condensate dark matter are attractive @xcite .",
    "therefore a large fraction of the vortices in the axion bec may form a single big vortex along the rotation axis of the galaxy .",
    "the resulting enhancement of caustic rings could explain the rises in the milky way rotation curve , usually attributed to caustic rings .",
    "the properties of the axionic dark matter have been extensively investigated in @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to extend the previous investigations of the @xmath0 polytropic bose - einstein dark matter halos , by considering in detail and in a systematic way the observationally relevant physical parameters . as a first step in this study we consider the mass and gravitational properties of the dark matter halos in the condensate model .",
    "the gravitational potential and energy of the halo , its kinetic energy , as well as the observationally extremely important logarithmic slopes of the density and velocity profiles are obtained .",
    "one of the most important method which could discriminate between the condensate model and other dark matter models is gravitational lensing .",
    "we obtain and present in detail , in an analytical form , the physical parameters ( surface mass density , deflection angle and magnification etc . )",
    "necessary for the analysis and comparison of the observational data with the predictions of the model .",

    "we make the fundamental assumption that the dark matter halos are composed of a strongly - coupled cold dilute bose - einstein condensate , at absolute zero temperature .",
    "hence this assumption implies that almost all of the dark matter particles are in the condensate .",
    "since the dark matter halo is dilute and cold , only binary collisions at low energy between dark matter particles are relevant .",
    "therefore , independently of the details of the two - body potential , it follows that the collisions can be characterized by a single physical parameter , the @xmath26-wave scattering length @xmath27 @xcite .",

    "when the number of particles in the condensate becomes large enough , the quantum pressure term makes a significant contribution to the thermodynamical parameters only near the boundary , and it is much smaller than the interaction energy term .",

    "<S> this enables arbitrary - precision calculations of the surface mass density , deflection angle , deflection potential , and of the magnification factor , thus giving the possibility of the comparison of the predicted lensing properties of the condensate dark matter halos with observations . </S>",
    "<S> the stability properties of the condensate halos are also investigated by using the scalar and the tensor virial theorems , respectively , and the virial perturbation equation for condensate dark matter halos is derived . as an application of the scalar virial theorem we consider the problem of the stability of a slowly rotating and slightly disturbed galactic dark matter halo . </S>",
    "<S> for such a halo the oscillations frequencies and the stability conditions are obtained in the linear approximation . </S>"
