    "the standard model ( sm ) is successful in explaining almost all observations in particle physics experiments so far . nevertheless , there are reasons to consider it as a low energy effective limit of a more general theory . in that prospect , observables for processes where",
    "the sm contribution is highly suppressed are particularly interesting . within the sm ,",
    "flavor - changing neutral current processes are highly suppressed since they are forbidden at tree level and can only proceed via loops diagrams .",
    "if new physics ( np ) exists , new particles can also contribute to those processes in the loop diagrams , modifying observable quantities with respect to the sm prediction .",
    "the lhcb detector  @xcite will take advantage of the copious @xmath6production cross - section expected at lhc  @xcite .",
    "it is a single - arm forward spectrometer primarily optimized for the study of @xmath7-violation and rare @xmath1-hadron decays .",
    "the detector is characterized by its precise vertex detector , powerful particle identification capabilities and versatile trigger .",
    "nominally , lhcb will operate at a luminosity @xmath8@xmath9 , giving @xmath10@xmath11of data per year ( @xmath12 seconds ) .",
    "the analyzes presented in this document are applied to monte carlo simulated data with a full detector response , including pile - up ( multiple @xmath13collisions in a single bunch crossing ) and spill - over ( signal coming from particles produced in a previous bunch crossing ) .",
    "@xmath2 physics requires excellent vertexing capabilities , momentum resolution and particle identification .",
    "the study of rare decays demands high background rejection and trigger performance .",
    "lhcb was designed to fulfill these requirements .",
    "its vertex locator provides an impact parameter resolution of @xmath14 $ ] that results in a @xmath2 proper - time resolution of @xmath15@xmath16@xmath17depending on the decay mode .",
    "the tracking system yields a momentum resolution of @xmath18 , leading to an invariant mass resolution of @xmath19@xmath20and @xmath21@xmath20for @xmath22and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "the branching fraction of this decay , @xmath25@xmath26  @xcite , was recently measured by the belle collaboration and is in agreement with the sm prediction . in the sm the polarization of the photon",
    "is precisely predicted . @xmath27 and @xmath28 are allowed transitions under helicity conservation , whereas the crossed transitions are suppressed by a factor @xmath29 .",
    "an observable @xmath30 is defined from the @xmath31 transition amplitude ratio as @xmath32 which is proportional to @xmath33 and very small in the sm . in extensions of the sm , such as the left - right symmetric model  @xcite and the unconstrained mssm  @xcite",
    "predict large values for @xmath30 .",
    "the measurement of the photon polarization thus provides a null test for the sm .",
    "the photon polarization is measured indirectly , through the time - dependent decay rate  @xcite . for the decay of @xmath34(@xmath31 ) mesons , the decay rate is : @xmath35 unlike belle and babar analyzes studying @xmath7 asymmetry in @xmath36  @xcite decay , we consider an analysis without flavor tagging .",
    "thus , adding the @xmath34and @xmath31 contributions , the two last terms of eq .",
    "( [ equ : phigamma ] ) cancel out . furthermore , since in the sm @xmath37 is expected to be non - zero in the @xmath34system , the decay rate is sensitive to @xmath30 , through @xmath38  @xcite . here",
    "@xmath39 represents the decay weak phase , that is approximately zero in the sm .",
    "note that , in the sm , a flavor tagged analysis is not expected to provide a better sensitivity on the measure of @xmath30 , because @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the main experimental issue is to understand the bias on the @xmath34lifetime coming from the trigger and offline cuts for the @xmath42 selection . for 2@xmath11 ,",
    "the expected signal yield is 11000 events with a @xmath43 and a @xmath34mass resolution of 92@xmath20  @xcite .",
    "this yield , leads to an expected resolution of 0.1 for the photon polarization observable @xmath30  @xcite .",
    "there are others channels considered to probe photon polarization , such as @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",
    "this decay branching fraction @xmath48@xmath49  @xcite is in agreement with the sm .",
    "asymmetries related to angular distributions are theoretically well predicted because hadronic uncertainties cancel out in the ratios .",
    "the forward - backward asymmetry of @xmath50 , the angle between the @xmath51 and the @xmath52 flight direction in the di - muon rest frame is such an observable .",
    "thus , the shape of @xmath53 as a function of the di - muon invariant mass squared , @xmath54 , is calculated for the sm and for extension models .",
    "the zero - crossing point of @xmath53 ( @xmath55 such that @xmath56 ) is a particularly interesting observable .",
    "its sm prediction is @xmath57@xmath58  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath53 for this channel was already measured at babar , belle and cdf  @xcite and exhibits some tension with respect to the sm prediction .",
    "however , the statistics is very low : the belle analysis , the most sensitive so far , is based on 230 events only .",
    "lhcb expects 7000 events per 2@xmath11 , with @xmath59 .",
    "the challenge for this analysis is the understanding of the biases on angular observables induced by detector and reconstruction effects .",
    "it is worth to note that the zero - crossing point value is little sensitive to those biases , making its measurement particularly interesting with early data .",

    "this simulation assumes the sm with @xmath63@xmath58 . ]",
    "the lhcb strategy for this decay consists of different methods of increasing sensitivity but also increasing requirements in statistics and acceptance understanding .",
    "the first method is a binned analysis for @xmath53 , combined with a linear fit to extract the zero - crossing point value  @xcite . with a few hundreds of @xmath64 ,",
    "this method will already compete with current measurements . with 2@xmath11 ,",
    "the expected resolution on @xmath62 is @xmath65@xmath58 and lhcb expects to reach the theoretical precision with 10@xmath11of data .",
    "the second method consists of an unbinned analysis for @xmath53 , with no linear assumption around the zero - crossing point  @xcite .",
    "this analysis yields a sensitivity similar to the binned analysis .",
    "figure  [ kmumu_unbinned ] depicts the expected @xmath53 shape obtained by the unbinned analysis for the sm and with 2@xmath11 .",
    "the next step is a full angular analysis , based on the three angles , which , with the di - muon invariant mass , completely define the decay kinematics  @xcite . using the three angle distributions ,",
    "a number of asymmetries and transversity amplitudes can be computed .",
    "the full angular analysis requires a good knowledge of detector acceptance effects and an integrated luminosity of at least 2@xmath11 .",
    "a thorough study has assessed the sensitivity to various observables  @xcite , of which some were shown to differ significantly between sm and np scenarios .",
    "an example of the sensitivity achievable with 10@xmath11for an observable particularly sensitive to np is shown in fig .",
    "[ kmumu_at4 ] .",
    "@xmath66 observable , defined in  @xcite .",
    "the sm prediction is shown by the dashed line , with @xmath60 and @xmath61 theoretical uncertainty bands .",
    "the dotted line depicts a particular susy scenario with positive mass insertion and large gluino mass , with @xmath60 and @xmath61 lhcb experimental error bands ( the solid line showing the central value of the toy experiments ) . ]",
    "within the sm , the @xmath22branching ratio is expected to be @xmath68  @xcite . in the mssm ,",
    "this decay receives additional contributions from new particles , _",
    "e.g. _ for large @xmath69values , the ratio of the higgs vacuum expectation values , the branching ratio is then proportional to @xmath69to the sixth power , and can be considerably enhanced  @xcite . the latest upper limit given by the cdf experiment is @xmath70 at @xmath71 cl  @xcite .",
    "the current lhcb strategy for the @xmath22decay search  @xcite can be summarized as follows .",
    "an efficient selection is applied with the goal to remove obvious background with minimal loss of signal events .",
    "the analysis relies on three independent variables related to , the di - muon invariant mass , the particle identification of the daughters , and geometrical information from the decay topology .",
    "since the three variables are uncorrelated , they can be calibrated independently . for each event , likelihood values",
    "are calculated for each of the three variables , under the signal and background hypotheses .",
    "calibration methods for these values , both for signal and for background , are designed to rely solely on real data .",
    "the compatibility of the obtained likelihood distributions is tested against various @xmath22branching ratio hypotheses , using the _ cl _ modified frequentist analysis  @xcite .",
    "the final result is either a measurement or an upper limit of the branching fraction .",
    "the branching fraction is expressed as : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the number of signal events , @xmath74 is the @xmath75 production cross - section , @xmath76 the integrated luminosity , @xmath77 the probability of a @xmath1 quark to hadronize in a @xmath34meson , and @xmath78 the product of the reconstruction , trigger , and selection efficiencies . since the number of @xmath34produced , @xmath79 , will not be precisely known , the use of a normalization channel of well - known branching fraction is required to obtain an absolute measurement of the branching fraction or upper limit .",
    "the branching fraction is then : @xmath80 where @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the quantities for the normalization channel , with definitions analogous to those of the signal channel .",
    "possible normalization channels are @xmath84and @xmath85 .",
    "particular care has been taken to analyze the signal and normalization channels in a common way such as to cancel any large systematic effects in the efficiency ratio .",
    "the main systematics arise from the @xmath86 uncertainty on the ratio @xmath87 or @xmath88 . with sufficient statistics ,",
    "all other systematic uncertainties are expected to get much smaller than that , as the analysis relies solely on data . to eliminate the factor @xmath89",
    ", the @xmath90 decay mode could be used in the future a normalization channel , if its absolute branching fraction can be measured more precisely at belle .",
    "the expected sensitivity of lhcb to the @xmath22decay as a function of the integrated luminosity is shown in fig .",
    "[ sensitivity ] .",
    "the solid line in the left plot shows the expected upper limit , at 90% confidence level , on the branching fraction when no signal is observed , for @xmath91 collisions at @xmath92@xmath93 .",
    "the branching fraction for which a @xmath94 discovery ( or for which a @xmath95 evidence ) is expected , is shown on the right plot for 14@xmath93collisions .",
    "the left plot also indicates the expected limit from the tevatron experiments , extrapolating the current results to 8@xmath11of data per experiment .",
    "it shows that lhcb can compete with the tevatron with approximately 0.1@xmath11of data and overtake its expected limit with about 0.2@xmath11 . in that time frame , the detector may not be fully understood yet .",
    "therefore , an alternative robust analysis is designed using variables with a physical content similar to the ones of the standard analysis , but avoiding the use of error estimates .",
    "this implies a modified selection and definition of the geometrical likelihood .",
    "the robust analysis sensitivity is also depicted in fig .",
    "[ sensitivity ] ( left ) , as a red dashed curve .",
    "the robust analysis presents a sensitivity comparable with the one of the standard analysis .",
    "therefore , it constitutes a valuable option for the early data .    about 3@xmath11(10@xmath11 ) are enough for a @xmath95 evidence ( @xmath94 observation ) if the branching fraction is equal to the sm prediction .",
    "any enhancement driven by np will be observed sooner .",
    "particularly , if the branching fraction is as high as @xmath96 , as predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite , a @xmath94 discovery is possible with very little luminosity ( @xmath97@xmath11 ) .",
    "the large @xmath6production cross - section expected at lhc , together with the characteristics of lhcb , leads to a good performance in the search for np in fcnc decays .",
    "rare @xmath2 decays are particularly interesting because of the precise theoretical predictions for some of their observables , and they provide stringent test of the sm and its extensions .",
    "expected sensitivities for lhcb s analyzes of the most promising rare @xmath2 decays were presented .",
    "one year of data taken in nominal conditions yields to the observation of the photon polarization in the @xmath98 decay to a 10% level and to the measurement of the @xmath53 zero - crossing point to a @xmath65@xmath58 resolution in the @xmath4decay mode .",
    "the same amount of data allows to set a limit on the @xmath22branching fraction down to the sm prediction if no signal is observed , strongly constraining np models with high @xmath69values . in case",
    "the branching fraction is enhanced , an observation of np is possible .    in the long term ,",
    "a full angular analysis of the @xmath4can be performed and bringing enhanced sensitivity in probing for np .",
