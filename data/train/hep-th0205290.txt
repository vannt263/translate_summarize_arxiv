    "these `` bubbles of nothing '' should then be related to some state in the field theory dual to string theory on ads@xmath4 .",

    "we will focus on the ads@xmath5 case , as this corresponds to the most well - understood field theory dual . for most of our results , there will be an obvious extension to the ads@xmath6 and ads@xmath7 cases .",

    "we begin by studying the analytic continuation of time and an angle ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) of schwarzschild - ads@xmath12 in section [ schw ] . as in the flat space case",
    ", @xmath13 is periodically identified , and the resulting geometry is only asymptotically locally ads ( even though the proper length of the @xmath13 circle grows at large distance ) .",
    "we find that the natural conformal boundary of this spacetime is three dimensional de sitter space times a circle ( ds@xmath14 ) . by the ads / cft correspondence ,",
    "the schwarzschild bubble should therefore be dual to @xmath15 su(n ) yang - mills theory on ds@xmath14 .",
    "the characteristic exponential expansion of the bulk spacetime is therefore seen directly in the background for the field theory dual .",
    "we provide evidence for the duality by computing the boundary stress tensor of the bubble spacetime and relating it to the expectation value of the stress tensor of yang - mills theory in ds@xmath14 .    in section [ kerr ]",
    ", we consider the extension to rotating black holes . analytically continuing time , an angle and a rotation parameter ( @xmath10 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) , we find that the presence of the negative cosmological constant introduces a qualitatively new feature compared to flat space : the metric has a coordinate singularity at a finite value of @xmath18",
    ". it would be interesting to understand this breakdown of the metric in more detail .",
    "however , the extension to include rotation does not introduce any simplification : since the proper distance in all directions grows like @xmath19 , the spacetime is still locally asymptotically ads ( unlike in flat space , where it was asymptotically flat ) , and the spacetime the dual field theory lives in still has an @xmath20 factor .",
    "finally , we consider the extension to charged black holes in ads in section [ rn ] .",
    "we think of this charge as arising from angular momentum on the @xmath21 , so we consider the analytic continuation of time , an angle and the charge ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) , parallelling the discussion of kerr - ads .",
    "these charged cases are interesting because they have the same ds@xmath14 conformal boundary , but there is now an additional parameter in the solution .    in section [ concl ] , we speculate about the interpretation of these results from the dual field theory point of view , and outline a program for future work .",

    "this 2-sphere is the boundary of a `` bubble of nothing '' in ads space which contracts from infinite size at @xmath36 to a minimum size at @xmath37 and then expands back out to infinite size as @xmath38 .",
    "the metric on the bubble boundary is that of 3d de sitter space .    at large @xmath19 , this metric will approach ads locally",
    "this is not obvious from the form of the asymptotic metric , @xmath39 however , we can relate this to the usual embedding coordinates @xmath40 by @xmath41 by contrast , the usual global ads metric is @xmath42 where @xmath43 .",
    "this is related to the embedding coordinates by @xmath44 thus , the time dependent metric ( [ timedep ] ) is related to the standard global ads coordinates ( [ ads ] ) by : @xmath45 @xmath46^{1/2 } } , { \\label{taut}}\\ ] ] @xmath47^{1/2}}.   { \\label{chit}}\\ ] ] .    to understand the asymptotic metric , consider ( [ timedep ] ) as a coordinatization of ads , which we will call the time - dependent ads coordinates .",
    "we see that these time - dependent coordinates do not even cover the entirety of a single period in global ads : the coordinate patch has a boundary at @xmath48 , corresponding to @xmath49 in particular , on the asymptotic boundary of the spacetime in global coordinates , @xmath50 , the boundary of the patch covered by the time - dependent coordinates is the null lines @xmath51 .",
    "we also see that in the time - dependent ads coordinates , we should use the full range @xmath52 . as in the usual flat space case  @xcite ,",
    "the main effects of considering the exact metric ( [ bubble ] ) on the coordinates are twofold ; the range of @xmath19 is restricted to @xmath53 ( which restricts us to a region of ads covered by the time - dependent coordinates ) , and the spacetime is identified under @xmath54 .    at large distances in ads ,",
    "i.e. , as @xmath50 , the restriction to @xmath53 coincides with @xmath55 , the boundary of the time - dependent coordinate patch ( up to exponential corrections in @xmath56 ) . the action of the periodic identification of @xmath13 on the asymptotic metric is however slightly complicated .",
    "we will express it in terms of the global ads coordinates . from ( [ chit ] )",
    ", we can see that a surface @xmath57 in ( [ timedep ] ) corresponds to @xmath58 in , for example , the @xmath59 slice , this surface will extend to the boundary along @xmath60 where @xmath61 .",
    "it reaches a minimum value @xmath62 at @xmath63 .",
    "away from the region near the bubble , we can approximate the bubble solution ( [ bubble ] ) by the time - dependent ads space ( [ timedep ] ) , with these two restrictions . from the point of view of the usual ads",
    "coordinates , the periodic identification in @xmath13 will identify two surfaces of the form ( [ chi0 ] ) , as depicted in figure [ identfig ] .",
    "this looks pictorially rather like the construction of btz from ads@xmath9 , but identifying hypersurfaces rather than geodesics .",
    "note however that this picture only takes into account the effects on the coordinates , and not the fact that the bubble geometry ( [ bubble ] ) differs from the time - dependent ads metric ( [ timedep ] ) in the interior .",
    "if we just made these identifications on the time - dependent ads metric ( [ timedep ] ) , it would not be smooth at small @xmath19in particular , in figure [ identfig ] , it looks like there is a finite minimum distance between the two surfaces of fixed @xmath13 , but in the true bubble geometry ( [ bubble ] ) , the distance between surfaces of fixed @xmath13 goes smoothly to zero .",
    "= 1.5 in    in the time - dependent ads coordinates ( [ timedep ] ) , the natural conformal compactification is a rescaling by @xmath64 , giving a boundary metric @xmath65 this is a 2 + 1 dimensional de sitter space times @xmath20 .",
    "thus , if we assume the ads / cft correspondence can be extended to such asymptotically locally ads cases , we should think of the dual description of this spacetime as given by some state of the sym theory on ds@xmath14 .",
    "this can be related to the usual theory on @xmath66 obtained from global ads by considering the boundary limit of the coordinate transformations ( [ taut],[chit ] ) , @xmath67^{1/2 } } , \\quad \\sinh \\chi / l = { \\sin \\psi \\over [ \\cos^2 \\psi - \\sin^2",
    "t / l]^{1/2}}.\\ ] ] these transformations take the metric ( [ timebdy ] ) to @xmath68 hence , from the boundary point of view , the coordinate transformation between time - dependent and global ads coordinates involves a conformal rescaling by @xmath69 .",
    "this conformal factor vanishes at the boundary of the time - dependent ads coordinate patch at @xmath55 , as expected . if we also consider the effect of the periodic identification in @xmath13 , by restricting to the fundamental region @xmath70 , we find that this conformal factor is non - zero except at @xmath71 .    from the field theory point of view , there is a single dimensionless parameter : the ratio of the size of the @xmath20 to the radius of curvature of the de sitter factor .",
    "this is just @xmath72 , and to understand the physics from the field theory point of view , we should express all quantities in terms of this parameter .",
    "in fact , if we solve ( [ chiident ] ) for @xmath32 in terms of @xmath73 , we find there are two roots : @xmath74.\\ ] ] in terms of the black hole solutions , this is just the usual statement that there is a minimum temperature for the black hole solutions , and there are two black holes for each temperature above that value  a smaller , unstable one and a larger stable one .    in the discussion of the flat space analogue in  @xcite",
    ", it was argued that the bubble spacetime would be classically stable , but quantum mechanically unstable .",
    "our expectations here are slightly different . for the larger root in ( [ rplus ] ) , we would expect that the bubble will be both classically and quantum mechanically stable .",
    "the argument for classical stability is in the same spirit as  @xcite : the black hole solution is classically stable , so when one performs the analytic continuation , one expects to find no modes of the form @xmath75 with negative mass@xmath76 on the de sitter factor ( it would be useful , however , to check this explicitly ) .",
    "the quantum instability in  @xcite was to the production of a widely - separated bubble .",
    "first of all , we should note that the global ads space ( [ ads ] ) with two surfaces of the form ( [ chi0 ] ) identified is not smooth .",
    "it is therefore not clear that we should give the bubble of nothing the same interpretation as a non - perturbative instability that the flat - space case had in  @xcite .",
    "also , the presence of a negative cosmological constant implies widely - separated objects can not be treated independently .",
    "finally , far from the original bubble , the @xmath13 direction has a large proper radius . as a result any identification of @xmath13 required to make a second bubble in the background of the first one will involve identifications over a very large proper length .",
    "this also suggests that there should be no instability to creating further bubbles .    for the smaller root in ( [ rplus ] ) ,",
    "on the other hand , there are signs of both classical and quantum instability .",
    "the corresponding black holes are thermodynamically unstable ; it has been argued  @xcite that this corresponds to a dynamical instability .",
    "this may well lead to a classical instability of the bubble solution . also , the solution with the larger root in ( [ rplus ] ) has lower energy , so we would expect the one with the smaller root to decay quantum - mechanically into this larger bubble .",
    "we have shown that the asymptotic boundary of the bubble spacetime is ds@xmath14 .",
    "therefore , by the ads / cft correspondence , we expect that @xmath77 su(n ) yang - mills theory on ds@xmath14 should be dual to the bubble . the time - dependence of the bubble spacetime is reflected directly in the fact that the cft lives on an expanding space . here",
    "we will present evidence for this duality by comparing the cft stress tensor to the boundary stress tensor calculated from the bulk spacetime using the counterterm subtraction procedure of  @xcite .    calculating the boundary stress tensor for the bubble spacetime ( [ bubble ] ) is a straightforward adaptation of the standard calculation of the boundary stress tensor for the schwarzschild - ads black hole .",
    "we must rescale the boundary stress tensor to express it in terms of the field theory in the boundary metric ( [ timebdy ] ) .",
    "the result for the bubble is @xmath78 where in the second equality we have used the standard relation @xmath79 to rewrite the stress tensor in terms of field theory quantities .",
    "it is interesting to compare this to the corresponding result for the ordinary schwarzschild - ads case , @xmath80    the positive sign of the @xmath81 component in ( [ stress ] ) implies that this solution has a negative mass , while the negative @xmath82 component is interpreted as a negative pressure ( i.e. , a tension ) along this direction .",
    "the stress tensor is traceless , as in schwarzschild - ads .",
    "this is as expected , since the boundary metric is the product of a circle and a three - dimensional einstein space , so the trace anomaly vanishes .",
    "notice that the stress tensor has one piece that depends on the parameter @xmath83 and another that only depends on the cosmological constant .",
    "below we will argue that the latter can be understood in the dual field theory as an anomaly contribution , while the former depends on the state .",
    "now , the dual description is in terms of @xmath84 sym on the ds@xmath85 spacetime ( [ timebdy ] ) .",
    "this spacetime is conformally flat .",
    "we have already seen that the coordinate transformation ( [ bdyxfm ] ) takes it to the form ( [ bdycyl ] ) , which is conformal to the einstein static universe ; since flat space can be conformally embedded in the einstein static universe , this implies that the boundary metric ( [ timebdy ] ) is conformally flat .",
    "since the spacetime is conformally flat , there is a standard result for the stress tensor  @xcite @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are conserved quantities constructed from the curvature ( see  @xcite for their definitions ) , and @xmath89 is a traceless state - dependent part . for the ds@xmath14 space ,",
    "the geometrical quantities are @xmath90 and @xmath91 to fix the coefficients @xmath92 and @xmath93 , we compute the trace of ( [ ftstress ] ) , @xmath94 and compare this to the conformal anomaly for @xmath84 sym  @xcite @xmath95 which fixes @xmath96 and @xmath97 . as a result , the field theory stress tensor is @xmath98 thus , the geometrical part of the stress tensor precisely reproduces the second term in ( [ stress ] ) that is independent of the parameter @xmath83 .    it remains to relate the state - dependent part of the field theory stress tensor to the other term in ( [ stress ] ) .",
    "since we obtained the bubble spacetime by analytic continuation from a euclidean solution , there is a natural vacuum state on the bulk spacetime defined by analytic continuation from the vacuum on the euclidean spacetime .",
    "similarly , there is a natural vacuum state in the field theory defined by analytic continuation from @xmath99 . it is presumably this euclidean vacuum state we should be considering .",
    "we will defer detailed consideration of the field theory state to future work . here",
    ", we will simply note that to compare to the field theory , we should rewrite the stress tensor in terms of the dimensionless parameter @xmath72 .",
    "the form of the stress tensor rewritten in terms of @xmath72 is lengthy , so we will not give it explicitly ; it can be easily obtained using ( [ rbound ] ) and ( [ rplus ] ) .",
    "note that there are two roots in ( [ rplus ] ) , giving two contributions to the partition function for a given @xmath100 .",
    "we expect that the larger root will dominate for the field theory state obtained from the euclidean vacuum .",
    "the schwarzschild - ads bubble discussed above is asymptotically locally ads ; it would be interesting to identify asymptotically ads solutions . in  @xcite ,",
    "the same issue for the schwarzschild bubble was explored by adding rotation .",
    "bubbles of nothing obtained by analytic continuation of kerr spacetimes were also considered previously in  @xcite .",
    "we will now examine the effects of including a rotation parameter in the ads case .",
    "we will find that , unlike the flat space case , this fails to remove the identification in the asymptotic region .",
    "there is also a new subtlety which arises from the presence of a negative cosmological constant .    to simplify comparison to the flat space treatment in  @xcite ,",
    "consider first the case @xmath101 .",
    "then the metric obtained by taking @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath23 in the kerr - ads black hole  @xcite is @xmath104 ^ 2 + { \\rho^2 \\over \\delta_r } dr^2 - { \\rho^2 \\over \\delta_\\tau } d\\tau^2 \\\\ & & + \\cosh^2 \\tau { \\delta_\\tau \\over \\rho^2 } \\left[\\alpha d\\chi + { ( r^2 - \\alpha^2 ) \\over ( 1 + \\alpha^2 l^{-2 } ) } d\\phi \\right]^2 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath105 @xmath106 and @xmath107    there is a bubble at @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the largest root of @xmath110 .",
    "but there is also now a breakdown of the metric at @xmath111 $ ] , where @xmath112 vanishes .",
    "the curvature remains finite at this point , so it may be just a coordinate singularity .",

    "it therefore seems very likely that the singularity at @xmath116 corresponds to a horizon .",
    "however , a different combination of @xmath117 and @xmath118 is playing the role of the hyperbolic angle in the rindler - like coordinates for each @xmath19 , so it is difficult to find a coordinate transformation that takes us through the horizon .",
    "similar difficulties arise in the case @xmath119 .",
    "the analytically - continued kerr - ads@xmath12 solution gives the bubble metric @xmath120 ^ 2 + { \\rho^2 \\over \\delta_r } dr^2 - { \\rho^2 \\over \\delta_\\tau } d\\tau^2   \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\cosh^2 \\tau { \\delta_\\tau \\over \\rho^2 } \\left[\\alpha d\\chi + { ( r^2 - \\alpha^2 ) \\over ( 1 + \\alpha^2 l^{-2 } ) } d\\phi \\right]^2 - \\sinh^2 \\tau { \\delta_\\tau \\over \\rho^2 }   \\left[\\beta d\\chi + { ( r^2 - \\beta^2 ) \\over ( 1 + \\beta^2 l^{-2 } ) } d\\psi \\right]^2 \\nonumber \\\\ & & -{(1+r^2 l^{-2 } ) \\over r^2 \\rho^2 } \\left [ \\alpha \\beta d\\chi + { \\beta   ( r^2 - \\alpha^2 ) \\cosh^2 \\tau \\over ( 1 + \\alpha^2 l^{-2 } ) } d\\phi - { \\alpha ( r^2 - \\beta^2 ) \\sinh^2 \\tau \\over ( 1 + \\beta^2 l^{-2 } ) } d\\psi \\right]^2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath121 @xmath122 and @xmath123 here , the coordinates @xmath124 and @xmath125 are angles with period @xmath126 .",

    "the induced metric is @xmath141 where @xmath142 it is also useful to consider a coordinate @xmath143 in terms of @xmath144 coordinates , the metric on the bubble is @xmath145 we see that the constant @xmath18 slices of the bubble are tori . unlike the non - rotating case , these tori are not all of finite size .",
    "the cycle parametrised by @xmath146 at fixed @xmath147 goes to zero size at @xmath148 , as we can see from the first form of the metric .",
    "more worryingly , the @xmath149 component in ( [ rbubble2 ] ) is @xmath150 so the cycle parametrized by @xmath151 at fixed @xmath146 will go to zero size when @xmath18 satisfies @xmath152 and becomes timelike for larger values of @xmath18",

    "proper lengths in the @xmath13 direction are asymptotically constant , while proper lengths in the @xmath153 directions grow linearly in @xmath19 at large distances .",

    "in the anti - de sitter case , however , proper lengths in the @xmath13 and sphere directions all grow linearly in @xmath19 , but this growth is removed by the conformal rescaling to obtain a boundary metric . hence , replacing the identification ( [ chiident ] ) by ( [ rident ] ) will not eliminate identifications in the conformal boundary ; the kerr - ads bubble spacetimes are still only asymptotically locally ads .",
    "since we are interested in considering bubbles in the context of the ads / cft correspondence , and hence in spacetimes which are asymptotically ads@xmath5 , there is another possibility to consider : we can add angular momentum on the @xmath21 .",
    "from the five - dimensional point of view , this corresponds to considering charged black holes : a particularly simple example is to add three equal commuting angular momenta , which will give electrically - charged reissner - nordstrom ads black holes  @xcite .",

    "the effects of @xmath159 in the metric are negligible at large @xmath19 , so the asymptotic structure of this spacetime is the same as the uncharged case , and we get the same ds@xmath14 metric ( [ timebdy ] ) on the conformal boundary . here",
    ", we can think of @xmath72 and @xmath159 ( which is an r charge in the cft ) as the appropriate parameters .",
    "we can determine the branch structure by considering the behaviour of @xmath73 as a function of @xmath32 .",
    "for small and large @xmath32 , @xmath161 .",
    "there will be a maximum where @xmath162 , which gives @xmath163 since this equation has only one real root , @xmath164 has a single maximum .",

    "we have begun an investigation of time - dependent bulk spacetimes in the context of the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "inspired by the work of  @xcite , we have considered the smooth bubble solutions obtained from analytic continuation of bulk black hole solutions .",
    "this gives asymptotically locally ads spacetimes which are dual to field theory on simple time - dependent backgrounds .",
    "the fact that the time - dependence of the bulk spacetime shows up as time - dependence in the background for the dual field theory is very encouraging .",
    "it suggests that there may be interesting connections between , for example , the notion of particle creation on the two sides of the duality .",

    "for the simplest example , the schwarzschild - ads@xmath12 bubble , the dual field theory lives on three - dimensional de sitter space cross a circle .",
    "we calculated the boundary stress tensor of the bubble spacetime and showed that that it had two pieces , one which depended on the parameters of the bubble , and the other which was universal .",
    "we showed that this universal part is reproduced by the universal anomaly contribution to the stress tensor of yang - mills theory on ds@xmath14",
    ". it will be very interesting for the future to understand the bubble parameter dependent part of the boundary stress tensor from the dual perspective . for given radius of the circle ,",
    "there are two bubble solutions , with different values for the minimum radius of the bubble .",
    "we expect that the smaller bubble solution should be unstable .",
    "a careful analysis of the classical perturbations of both these solutions , along the lines of the analysis of the ads solitons in  @xcite , would be very useful .",
    "we extended the construction to include angular momentum both in the ads factor and on the @xmath21 . for angular momentum on the ads factor , there are new coordinate singularities which appear after analytic continuation for generic values of the parameters .",
    "these seem to be associated with a horizon in the bulk spacetime , but we did not attempt to resolve this issue in detail .",
    "angular momentum on the @xmath21 is more tractable , and leads to a structure which is very similar to the schwarzschild - ads case , but with an additional parameter .",
    "varying this parameter provides additional opportunities to study the behaviour of the dual field theory .",
    "we note that unlike in  @xcite , adding either kind of angular momentum does not simplify the asymptotic structure of the spacetime or alter the late - time behaviour of the bubble .",
    "the main direction for future work is to study the properties of the field theory on ds@xmath14 , and attempt to relate the vacuum states on that background to the bulk spacetimes discussed here .",
    "it would be very interesting if particle production in the bulk and on the boundary could be related .",
    "another open area is to attempt to find constructions that give tractable time - dependent asymptotically ads solutions , which could be related to the field theory on @xmath165",
    ".    it would also be interesting to consider the analogues of the construction in  @xcite , quotienting ads by a timelike or a null isometry .",
    "however , since these isometries also act on the conformal boundary , this will lead to identifications in the dual as well , and it may be difficult to deal with the resulting backgrounds in the field theory .",
