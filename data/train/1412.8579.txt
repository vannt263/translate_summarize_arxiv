    "nowadays it is recognized that the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) is a common quantum property of the many - particle systems in which the number of particles is conserved . if particles are bosons , the interaction between particles must be repulsive , whereas if particles are fermions , the interaction must be attractive .",
    "the generalized bec is the macroscopic accumulation of bose particles in the energetic ground state below a critical temperature . in 1995 , the three research groups in the u. s. a. observed the bec of ultracold bose atomic gases in a trapping potential @xcite . in 1938",
    ", kapitza discovered the superfluid phase of liquid @xmath5he below 2.17 k , which can be viewed as a bec among strongly interacting @xmath5he atoms . in 1911",
    ", onnes discovered the superconducting state of metal mercury below 4 k. in 1957 , bardeen , cooper , and schrieffer provided a successful microscopic description of superconductors in terms of cooper pairs @xcite .",
    "the superconducting state can be regarded as a manifestation of the bec of cooper pairs .",
    "the bec has been observed also in several systems of solid - state quasiparticles , which include excitons @xcite , exciton - polaritons @xcite , and magnons @xcite .",
    "however , the most omnipresent blackbody radiation does not show this phase transition .",
    "the photons in blackbody radiation have a vanishing chemical potential , so that the number of photons is not conserved when the temperature of the blackbody is varied ; at low temperatures , photons are absorbed by the walls of the blackbody instead of occupying the zero - momentum state .",
    "theoretical works have considered thermalization processes that conserve photon number , involving compton scattering with a gas of thermal electrons @xcite or photon - photon scattering in a nonlinear resonator configuration @xcite .",
    "number - conserving thermalization was experimentally observed @xcite for a two - dimensional photon gas in a dye - filled optical microcavity , which acts as a ` white - wall ' box . in the presence of thermalization processes that conserve photon number , weitz and colleagues",
    "have observed the bec of two - dimensional photons in a dye - filled optical microcavity @xcite .",
    "kirton and keeling have established a nonequilibrium model of photonic bec in the dye - filled microcavity @xcite .",
    "now , let us turn to a gas of three - dimensional photons in the universe .",
    "the evolution of the universe according to the standard hot big - bang model @xcite is sketched as follows : ( 1 ) radiation - dominated phase . at the age of the universe earlier than about 10000 years , when the temperature of the universe exceeded @xmath6 ev , the energy density in radiation and relativistic particles exceeded that in matter . at the earliest times , the energy in the universe consists of radiation and seas of relativistic particle - antiparticle pairs . at the time of 10@xmath7 second ,",
    "when @xmath8 gev , the sea of relativistic particles includes six species of quarks and antiquarks , six types of leptons and antileptons , and twelve gauge bosons .",
    "when @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the mass of a particle species , those particles and their antiparticles annihilate into at least two photons . when the universe was seconds old and the temperature was around 1 mev , big - bang nucleosynthesis led to the production of the light elements d , @xmath11he , @xmath5he , and @xmath12li .",
    "when @xmath13 mev , the last of the particle - antiparticle pairs , the electrons and positrons , annihilated .",
    "( 2 ) matter - dominated phase .",
    "when the temperature reached around @xmath14 ev , at a time of around 10000 years the energy density in matter began to exceed that in radiation .",
    "shortly after matter domination begins , photons in the universe undergo their last - scattering off free electrons .",
    "last scattering is precipitated by the recombination of electrons and ions ( mainly free protons ) , which occurs at a temperature of @xmath15 ev because neutral atoms are energetically favored . before last - scattering , matter and radiation",
    "are tightly coupled ; after last - scattering , matter and radiation are essentially decoupled . under the surface of last scattering , the number of photons in the universe is conserved .    in 1914 , planck introduced the concept of a white body @xcite . a white body is one for which all incident radiation is reflected uniformly in all directions , an idealization exactly opposite to that of the blackbody . in nature , no true white bodies are known .",
    "we assume that the universe after last - scattering is an ideal white body that contains a tremendously large number of thermal photons and is at an extremely high temperature .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "1 , an ideal white body can be regarded as a rectangular cavity whose walls are high - reflecting planar optical mirrors and are kept at a constant temperature @xmath16 .",
    "this white body contains only thermal radiation in its interior .",
    "because the cavity walls absorb no electromagnetic radiation , the number of photons is conserved in the white body . in the present paper , we shall study the bec of photons in an ideal white body .",
    "the bec of photons in an ideal white body takes place in the momentum space .",
    "the planar mirrors provide a chemical potential for a photon , making the system formally equivalent to a three - dimensional gas of number - conserving , massless bosons .",
    "the advantages of an ideal white body are as follows : ( 1 ) the loss rate is zero and ( 2 ) the nonlinearity does not exist .",
    "the important properties of such a bec will be expounded in the following . at first , we investigate the bec of noninteracting photons in an ideal white body .",
    "it is found that such a bec is a second phase transition .",
    "the expresson of transition temperature @xmath0 is obtained , which is dependent on the number density @xmath1 of photons . at finite temperature",
    ", we find that the condensate fraction @xmath2 decreases continuously from one to zero as the temperature increases from zero to the transition temperature @xmath0 .",
    "we find that the vacuum we currently observe is the condensate or superfluid of photons .",
    "further , we study the radiation properties of an ideal white body .",
    "it is found that in the condensation region of @xmath3 , the spectral intensity @xmath4 of white body radiation is identical with planck s law for blackbody radiation .",
    "our investigation into the bec of three - dimensional photons deepens our understanding of the development of the universe as an ideal white body . since the bec of three - dimensional photons was never explored previously , we point out here that there are new features , which we believe are worthy of exploration .",
    "the predicted properties of the bec of photons in an ideal white body are highly relevant to the present universe .",
    "because the number of photons is conserved in a white body , the photon system possesses a nonvanishing chemical potential @xmath17 .",
    "now we need to quantize the electromagnetic field . in terms of the creation and annihilation operators @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively , of circularly polarized photons with wave vector @xmath20 and helicity @xmath21 , the grand canonical hamiltonian @xmath22 of the photon system is given by @xmath23 where the zero - point energy terms are dropped . here",
    "@xmath24 is planck s constant reduced , @xmath25 is the angular frequency of a photon , and @xmath26 is the propagation velocity of light in the vacuum .",
    "equation ( 1 ) represents the grand canonical hamiltonian of the system of noninteracting photons .    in the representation with a set of quantum numbers @xmath27 , an energy level of a three - dimensional photon",
    "is denoted by the quantum number @xmath28 . in the grand canonical ensemble ,",
    "the system under study consists of @xmath29 noninteracting photons , which are distributed over various quantum states @xmath28 and have a chemical potential @xmath17 .",
    "based on the first principles of statistical mechanics , one knows that the average number @xmath30 of photons in the @xmath28th state of energy @xmath31 obeys the bose - einstein distribution @xmath32 where @xmath33 is related to the temperature @xmath16 by @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath17 is determined by the constraint that the total number of photons in the system is @xmath29 : @xmath36 the phenomenon of bec for noninteracting photons is fully described by eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) .",
    "the nontrivial aspect is the determination of the chemical potential as a function of @xmath29 and @xmath16 .",
    "once @xmath17 is known , all thermodynamic quantities like total energy , specific heat , and pressure follow directly from sums over the energy levels involving the occupation numbers in eq .",
    "to this end , eq .",
    "( 2 ) can be rewritten as follows : @xmath37 where the fugacity @xmath38 can be expressed as @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the ground state of the system is the state with @xmath41 , and the energy of the ground state is zero .",
    "the bec means that at low temperatures , a macroscopic number of photons occupies the ground state . from eq .",
    "( 4 ) , the average number of photons in the ground state is @xmath42 .",
    "the ground - state population diverges as @xmath43 . when we split off the the ground - state population in eq .",

    "( 5 ) includes an integral over @xmath45 and a sum over @xmath46 . on putting eq .",
    "( 4 ) into eq . ( 5 ) , eq . ( 5 ) is transformed into the following form : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a special case of the bose functions @xmath49 .",
    "it is obvious that for real values of @xmath38 between 0 and 1 , @xmath48 is a bounded , positive , monotonically increasing function of @xmath38 . at @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and at @xmath52 , @xmath53 . to satisfy eq .",

    "the fugacity @xmath38 can be determined numerically from eq .",
    "@xmath38 is a function of temperature @xmath16 , volume @xmath55 , and photon number @xmath29 .",

    "we find that the condensate fraction of photons in the ground state is given by @xmath63 this means that a macroscopic number of photons occupies the ground state .",

    ", we can see that the bec of three - dimensional photons in a white body takes place in the momentum space .",
    "as we have known , last - scattering deceased at a temperature of @xmath15 ev .",
    "the critical temperature @xmath0 of photonic bec should meet the condition @xmath64 ev .",

    "the universe before last - scattering was filled with a large number of thermal free electrons . the electromagnetic field within the universe before last - scattering is in thermodynamical equilibrium but has no conserved photon number @xcite .",
    "such equilibrium is established via the continual scattering of photons by thermal free electrons . the electromagnetic field in thermal equilibrium",
    "is called thermal radiation and characterized by a definite temperature @xmath16 . the universe after last - scattering can keep the photon number conserving and thus becomes a white body . the thermal radiation in a white body",
    "is also called white - body radiation .",
    "the photons in a white body are in a thermal radiation state , which is called a normal state . in order to characterize the thermal radiation state",
    ", we need to conceive a grand canonical ensemble of photons .",
    "some identical systems of the ensemble may be in an eigenstate of the hamiltonian @xmath22 given by eq .",
    "( 1 ) , while the distribution of the ensemble over the eigenstates is described by the density operator of the thermal radiation state @xmath76 the basis states used in the trace are the eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath22 .",
    "the main thermodynamic quantity in white - body radiation is the total energy @xmath77 or the energy density @xmath78 , which is the ensemble average of the corresponding microscopic quantity , @xmath79 here we have utilized the average notation @xmath80 .",
    "it is easily found that the ensemble average of the number operator of photons in a mode @xmath81 satisfies the well - known bose - einstein distribution given by eq .",
