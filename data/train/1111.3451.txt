    "the @xmath0 large area telescope ( @xmath0-lat ) has discovered over 80 @xmath1-ray pulsars , and revealed that the @xmath1-ray pulsars are a major class of galactic @xmath1-ray sources . of these , @xmath0-lat first detected pulsed @xmath1-ray emission from 11 millisecond pulsars , hereafter denoted as msps ( abdo et al .",
    "2010a , b , c , 2009a , b ; saz parkinson et al .",
    "2010 ; guillemot et al .",
    "the @xmath1-ray emission from pulsars has a long history , having been discussed in the context of a polar cap accelerator ( ruderman & sutherland 1975 ; daugherty & harding 1982 , 1996 ) , a slot gap ( arons 1983 ; muslimov & harding 2004 ; harding , usov & muslimov 2005 ; harding et al .",
    "2008 ; harding & muslimov 2011 ) and an outer gap accelerator ( cheng , ho & ruderman 1986a , b ; hirotani 2008 ; takata , wang & cheng 2010b ) . the cut - off features of the @xmath1-ray spectra of the crab and the vela pulsars as measured by @xmath0 imply that the @xmath1-ray emission site of canonical pulsars is located in the outer magnetosphere .",
    "this is in contrast to a site near the polar cap region which produces a cut - off feature steeper than observed ( aliu et al .",
    "2009 ; abdo et al .",
    "2009c , 2010d ) . however , venter , harding & guillemot ( 2009 ) found that the observed pulse profiles of several msps detected by the @xmath0 can not be explained by the outer gap and/or the slot gap models .",
    "hence , they proposed a pair - starved polar cap model in which particles are continuously accelerated to high altitude because multiplicity of the pairs is insufficient to screen the electric field",
    ". therefore , the origin of the @xmath1-ray emission from msps remains to be clarified .",
    "we present the spin period vs. the dipole moment for the rotation powered msps in figure  [ pb ] , in which the @xmath1-ray emitting msps are marked with open circles . the spin period in the accretion stage",
    "may be related to the equilibrium spin period , which is obtained by equating the co - rotation radius @xmath2 to the alfven radius @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the neutron star mass and @xmath5 is the accretion rate .",
    "the equilibrium spin period implies @xmath6 ( alpar et al . 1982 ) . in figure",
    "[ pb ] , we illustrate the relation @xmath7 , where @xmath8 , @xmath9 . the normalization factor is chosen as @xmath10 ( solid line ) , which gives an upper limit to the magnetic field for the recently activated radio msp psr  j1023 + 0038 ( see below ) , and @xmath11 ( dash line ) , which reproduces the typical @xmath12 relation for the fermi - lat msps and the radio msps . in section  [ accretion ] , we apply the above relations to estimate the magnetic moment of accreting msps .    in figure  [ pb ] , the new radio msps , whose locations are coincident with the @xmath0 unidentified sources are marked with boxes .",
    "in fact , it has been pointed out that over 20 new radio msps have been discovered as @xmath0 identified sources ( e.g. keith et al .",
    "since the detection of the spin period of msps ( in particular in binary systems ) via a blind search is very difficult , it is likely that @xmath0 has missed the identification of many msps .",
    "thus , some of them may be associated with the @xmath0 unidentified sources .",
    "for example , takata , wang and cheng ( 2011a , b , c ) performed population studies of @xmath1-ray pulsars and argued on statistical grounds that the @xmath1-ray emission from over 100 msps are missed , possibly contributing to the @xmath0 unidentified sources .",
    "psr  j1023 + 0038 is known to be the first and only rotation powered radio msp in a quiescent low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) first j102347.67 + 003841.2 .",
    "the possibility of @xmath1-ray emission from the newly born msp psr  j1023 + 0038 has been pointed out by tam et al .",
    "this system showed clear evidence of an accretion disk in 2001 and its possible absence in 2002 ( wang et al .",
    "2009 ) , perhaps indicating that the pulsar became activated . to facilitate the transition from an accreting msp x - ray pulsars ( amp ) to a rotation powered msp , the accretion of matter onto the ns must decrease rapidly .",
    "campana et al .",
    "( 1998 ) argued that the `` propeller '' effect , in which the alfven radius exceeds the co - rotation radius , operates during the quiescent state of an x - ray transient lmxb phase ( romanova et al .",
    "2009 ) to eject matter from the system .",
    "takata , cheng & taam ( 2010a ) suggest that the activation of the rotation powered pulsar phase in a short period lmxb is likely to occur during the quiescent state and that the @xmath1-ray emission produced in the outer gap accelerator in the pulsar magnetosphere irradiates the surrounding disk , thereby , further enhancing this ejection of disk material .",
    "the activation of rotation powered pulsars has been hypothesized based on the orbital modulations in the optical emission observed in the quiescent state of lmxbs , i.e. , first 102347.68 + 003841.2 ( thorstensen & armstrong 2005 ) , sax j1808.4 - 3658 ( burderi et al .",
    "2003 ; deloye et al .",
    "2008 ) , xte  1814 - 338 ( davanzo et al . 2009 ) , and igr  j00291 + 5934 ( jonker et al . 2008 ) . in these systems ,",
    "the amplitude of the optical modulation can not be explained by irradiation associated with the x - ray emission from the disk or from the neutron star ( ns ) surface due to insufficient luminosity . to provide an explanation of the orbital modulation of the optical emission , pulsar wind models",
    "have been suggested in which heating of the donor is due to the effect of a relativistic pulsar wind ( burderi et al .",
    "however there are some unresolved issues on this picture ; for example , ( 1 ) heating process of the stellar matter by the pulsar magnetic field if the wind energy near the companion star is dominated by the magnetic energy and ( 2 ) conversion mechanism from electromagnetic energy into the particle energy within @xmath13  cm from the pulsar if the wind energy is dominated by the particle energy . in this paper , because of the large theoretical uncertainties on the pulsar wind model , we will not pursue this picture in further detail .",
    "alternatively , we will discuss the @xmath1-ray irradiation from the outer gap as a possible heating process of the companion star ( section  [ accretion ] ) .    in the x - ray band , the emission from rotation powered msps can be composed of thermal emission from a heated polar cap region plus ( for some pulsars ) non - thermal emission of magnetospheric origin . although the number of the non - thermal x - ray emitting msps have increased due to the improved sensitivity of recent x - ray instruments ( e.g. zavlin 2007 ) , the origin of pulsed non - thermal x - ray emission from msps is not well understood .",
    "since the population of the @xmath1-ray msps has increased due to the detections by the @xmath0-lat , a study of the emission process in the x - ray and @xmath1-ray bands is necessary for discriminating between various non - thermal emission processes in the magnetosphere .",
    "observationally , x - ray emission from the ns surface has been detected during the quiescent state of several lmxbs ( see heinke et al . 2009 and",
    "reference therein ) .",
    "this emission coupled with estimates for the time averaged mass accretion rate has been utilized to probe the equation of state of ns matter ( e.g. yakovlev , levenfish & haensel 2003 ; campana et al .",
    "2008 ) . for some systems",
    ", the thermal x - ray emission may be very weak in the quiescent state ( e.g. , sax  j1808.4 - 3658 ) and the x - ray emission may be well fit by a power law spectrum ( heinke et al . 2009 ) .",
    "the finding of non - thermal x - ray emission from sax  j1808.4 - 3658 may provide possible evidence for the activation of the rotation powered activity in the quiescent state , although the origin of this power law component is unclear at present , as it may be due , for example , to the emission from the magnetosphere or intra - binary shock .    the x - ray emission from an intra - binary shock in the msp and low mass star ( hereafter lms ) system has been suggested to explain the observed unresolved non - thermal x - ray emissions from psr  b1957/lms binary system ( arons & tavani 1993 ; stappers et al .",
    "2003 ; huang & becker 2007 ) , in which the lms eclipses the radio emission from the msp",
    ". moreover , similar binary ( so called `` black widow '' ) systems have been discovered at the positions of the @xmath0 unidentified sources ( roberts et al .",
    "2011 ) , which raises questions regarding the origin of the high - energy emissions from msp / lms system .",
    "as we have described above , observational evidence for non - thermal x - ray and @xmath1-ray emission from the different evolutionary stages of msps has been accumulating . in this paper",
    ", we discuss the @xmath1-ray and x - ray emissions from isolated rotation powered msps and those in binary systems .",
    "specifically , we model the @xmath1-ray emission from the outer gap of the msps , and explore ( 1 ) the origin of the @xmath1-ray emission from rotation powered msps detected by @xmath0-lat and ( 2 ) the possibility that irradiation by the @xmath1-rays from the outer gap can explain the optical modulation of quiescent lmxbs .",
    "we also discuss the non - thermal x - ray emission associated with the outer gap activities and the high - energy emission from an intra - binary shock . in section  [ model ] , we review the @xmath1-ray emission from the outer gap accelerator in a pulsar magnetosphere and suggest that the thermal x - ray emission from the polar cap region can arise from the heating due to incoming particles , which were accelerated in the outer gap . in section  [ rotation",
    "] , we apply the model to the rotation powered msps and compare the predicted @xmath1-ray luminosity with the @xmath0 observations . in section  [ accretion ] , the various processes determining the ns surface temperature which depend on the ns model of the accreting millisecond pulsars ( amps ) in quiescent lmxbs are discussed .",
    "in addition , we estimate the @xmath1-ray luminosity from the outer gap accelerator . in section  [ nonx ] ,",
    "the non - thermal x - ray emission is discussed within the context of the outer gap model , and we predict the relation between the non - thermal x - ray luminosity and the spin down power of rotation powered msps .",
    "in addition , the non - thermal x - ray luminosity from the amp in the quiescent lmxb is discussed as a function of the time averaged accretion rate . in section  [ intra ] ,",
    "we discuss high - energy emission from an intra - binary shock in msp / lms binary , and describe the difference in the properties between the intra - binary shock emission and the magnetospheric emission .",
    "finally , a brief summary is presented in the last section .",
    "in the outer gap accelerator model for rotation powered pulsars , electrons and/or positrons can be accelerated by the electric field along the magnetic field lines in the region where the local charge density deviates from the goldreich - julian charge density .",
    "the typical strength of the accelerating field in the gap is expressed as ( zhang & cheng 1997 ) @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the electrical potential drop across the polar cap , @xmath16 is the spin period , @xmath17 is the dipole moment of the ns , @xmath18 is the curvature radius of the magnetic field line and @xmath19 is the light cylinder radius . in addition , @xmath20 is the fractional gap thickness , which is defined as the ratio of the gap thickness at the light cylinder to the light cylinder radius @xmath21 . from the energy balance between the dipole radiation and the spin down of the pulsar , the dipole moment of the ns",
    "is estimated from @xmath22 where @xmath23 is ns moment of inertia assumed to be @xmath24 .",
    "in addition , @xmath25 is the time derivative of the spin period in units of @xmath26 .    by assuming force balance between the acceleration and radiation reaction of the curvature radiation process",
    ", the typical lorentz factor of the particles in the gap is @xmath27 where @xmath28 .",
    "the typical energy of the curvature photons is estimated to be @xmath29 the @xmath1-ray luminosity from the outer gap is typically @xmath30 where we used the spin down power @xmath31 .",
    "we note that the electron and positron pairs are mainly created around the inner boundary of the outer gap ( cheng , ruderman & zhang 2000 ; takata , chang & shibata 2008 ; takata et al .",
    "2010b ) , implying that the outgoing particles are accelerated with whole gap potential drop , whereas the incoming particles can only receive @xmath32 of the gap potential drop .",
    "hence , we expect that the power carried by the outgoing particles is , at least , one order of magnitude greater than that carried by the incoming particles . in the gap , furthermore , because the curvature radiation process is occurring under the force balance between the acceleration force and the radiation back reaction force , as assumed in equation  ( [ gamma ] ) , the particles lose most of the energy gain via the curvature radiation process .",
    "hence , the luminosity of the outgoing @xmath1-rays is , at least , one order of magnitude greater than that of the incoming @xmath1-rays . as we will discuss in section  [ heating ] , the incoming particles eventually reach the stellar surface and heat up the polar cap region , producing the observed thermal x - ray emissions .",
    "the lorentz factor of the incoming particles is reduced from @xmath33 at the inner boundary of the outer gap to @xmath34 at the stellar surface , indicating the x - ray emissions from the heated polar cap region is at least two order of magnitude less than the outgoing @xmath1-rays radiated by the outgoing particles .",
    "as equation  ( [ lgamma ] ) indicates , the @xmath1-ray luminosity from the pulsar depends on its spin down luminosity . on the other hand , the spin down luminosity depends on the structure of magnetosphere and the inclination angle between the magnetic axis and the rotation axis , indicating the predicted  @xmath1-ray luminosity from the outer gap depends on the structure of the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "for example , spitkovsky ( 2006 ) represented the dipole field structure in the ideal mhd limit , in which there is no accelerating field , and found that the inferred spin down luminosity , @xmath35 , can be up to 3 times larger than the standard vacuum formula @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the inclination angle .",
    "although the magnetospheric structure has not been understood well , the real magnetosphere with the accelerating region will be between the vacuum limit and the ideal mhd limit ( e.g. constantinos et al . 2011 ; li , spitkovsky & tchekhovskoy , 2011 ; wada and shibata 2011 ) , and therefore the spin down luminosity will be only a factor of 1 - 3 different from that of standard formula ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "furthermore , the detailed structure of the magnetosphere , such as the magnetic field configurations , will be more important to the pulse profiles and the phase - resolved spectra , which are beyond the scope of this paper . in this paper , therefore , we apply the standard formula as a typical magnitude of the spin down power .      half of the particles accelerated in the outer gap will return to the polar cap region and heat the stellar surface .",
    "several rotation powered msps exhibit thermal x - ray radiation characterized by a temperature of @xmath39  k ( zavlin 2007 ) , which is much higher than @xmath40  k expected from the standard neutrino cooling scenario ( yakovlev & pethick 2004 for the review ) .",
    "furthermore , the size of the inferred emitting region corresponds to an effective radius of @xmath41  cm , which is much smaller than the ns radius . for some msps the observed x - ray spectra can be fit by black body radiation with two components , that is , a `` core '' component described by a higher temperature ( @xmath42  k ) , but smaller effective radius ( @xmath43  cm ) , and a `` rim '' component with a lower temperature ( @xmath44  k ) and larger effective radius ( @xmath45  cm ) .",
    "the observed temperatures and the effective radii of the 11 @xmath1-ray emitting msps are summarized in table  1 .",
    "these observations provide indirect evidence for additional heating of the polar cap region .",
    "it has been hypothesized that near the stellar surface , the magnetic field configuration is not dominated by a dipole field ( ruderman 1991 ; chen , ruderman & zhu 1998 ) .",
    "higher order multipole field configurations are likely and the strength of these components can be 1 - 3 orders of magnitude greater than the global dipole field .",
    "the distance @xmath46 from the star for which the local magnetic field is comparable to the dipole field is estimated from the relation @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the strength of the local magnetic field at the stellar surface , @xmath49 is the stellar radius , and @xmath50  cm is the thickness of the ns crust . with @xmath51 ,",
    "we find @xmath52 .",
    "we expect that because of the bending of the local magnetic field with a smaller curvature radius ( @xmath53  cm ) than @xmath54  cm of the dipole field , the curvature photons emitted between @xmath55 will illuminate a wider area on the stellar surface than that connected to the outer gap via the global dipolar magnetic field lines .    in figure",
    "[ localst1 ] , we illustrate this picture for the structure of the polar cap region .",
    "the incoming relativistic particles , which were accelerated in the gap , lose their energy via curvature radiation between the stellar surface and the inner boundary of the gap , and its lorentz factor decreases to @xmath56 [ equation  ( [ gamma1 ] ) ] near the stellar surface ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "near the stellar surface , the incoming particles emit @xmath1-ray photons with an energy @xmath58  mev , where @xmath59 is the electron rest mass energy and @xmath60 is the fine structure constant ( wang et al . 1998 ; takata et al .",
    "these @xmath61mev photons may be converted into pairs via the local magnetic field , whose strength may reach @xmath62  gauss . the local magnetic field will bend the trajectory of the incoming particles so that the @xmath63  mev photons will illuminate and heat a significant part of the polar cap region . the incoming particles eventually impact on the stellar surface with a lorentz factor @xmath64 [ equation  ( [ gammas ] ) ] , and their remaining energy will heat an area much smaller than the polar cap region .",
    "we expect that the former and latter components are observed as the rim and core components respectively . with a strong local magnetic field ,",
    "the typical size of the core component is estimated as @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the size of the polar cap region of the dipole field .",
    "this yields @xmath67  km with @xmath68 , which is consistent with the observations ; for example @xmath69  km for psr j  0030 + 4051 ( table  1 ) .    between the ns star surface and the inner boundary of the gap ,",
    "the evolution of the lorentz factor is approximately described by @xmath70 near the surface , @xmath71 provides a good approximation for the curvature radius of the dipole field . assuming that @xmath72 and the lorentz factor at @xmath73 is much smaller than that at the inner boundary of the gap",
    ", we obtain @xmath74^{-1/3}\\sim \\gamma_{1 } , \\label{gamma1}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 is the radial distance to the inner boundary of the gap and @xmath76    in the region between @xmath55 , the trajectories of the particles are described by the local magnetic field lines , which have a curvature radius of @xmath77  cm .",
    "in such a case , the lorentz factor of the particles at the stellar surface can be estimated from @xmath78 where @xmath79  cm .",
    "the x - ray luminosity and temperatures for the rim @xmath80 and core ( @xmath81 components are calculated from @xmath82 and @xmath83 respectively , where @xmath84 is the number of incoming particles per unit time and @xmath85 is the stefan - boltzmann constant .",
    "in addition , @xmath86 and @xmath87 are the effective radii of the heated region of the rim and core components respectively .",
    "wang , takata and cheng ( 2010 ) fit the phase - averaged spectrum of @xmath1-ray pulsars using the outer gap model and suggested that the averaged current density is about 50  % of the goldreich - julian value .",
    "hence , we take the rate of the incoming particles as @xmath88 as a result , the x - ray luminosity of the rim and core components are described by @xmath89 and @xmath90 where @xmath91 $ ] .",
    "the temperature of the heated surface becomes @xmath92 and @xmath93 respectively , where @xmath94  cm ) and @xmath95  cm ) .",
    "for the canonical pulsar , the core component is observed with a luminosity one or two order of magnitude fainter than that of the rim component ; for example , @xmath96 and @xmath97 for the geminga pulsar ( kargaltsev et al .",
    "halpern & ruderman ( 1993 ) studied the thermal x - ray emissions from the heated polar cap due to the bombardment of the incoming particles , which were accelerated in the outer gap , and found that the predicted luminosity @xmath98 with a temperature @xmath99  k for the geminga pulsar is too bright compared with the observed luminosity of the core component @xmath100 .",
    "hence , they proposed that most of the x - ray photons from the heated polar cap region is scattered by the resonant compton scattering and are eventually redistributed as a thermal emission from almost entire surface with a temperature @xmath101  k , which is observed as the rim component(wang et al .",
    "1998 ; cheng & zhang 1999 ) .    for the msps ,",
    "the observed luminosity of the core component ( @xmath102 ) is comparable to that of the rim component ( @xmath103 ) , as table  1 indicates .",
    "in fact , our model predicts that most of thermal emissions from the heated polar cap regions directly emerge without the resonant scattering ( section  [ rotation ] ) . because of the weaker magnetic field of the msps , the resonant compton scattering may be less effective as compared with the case of the canonical pulsar .",
    "as argued by takata et al . ( 2010b ) the outer gap can be controlled by either the photon - photon pair - creation process or the magnetic pair - creation process . in this section ,",
    "we first review the outer gap model controlled by the photon - photon pair - creation process in section  [ photon ] and the magnetic pair - creation process in section  [ magnetic ] . for reference ,",
    "table  1 summarizes the observed parameters of the msps detected by the @xmath0-lat .",
    "the @xmath1-rays emitted in the outer gap can collide with the x - rays from the heated polar cap and convert into electron - positron pairs .",
    "it is possible that this process , itself , controls the thickness of the outer gap ( zhang & cheng 1997 , 2003 ) .",
    "however , given the existence of the rim and core components , it is not clear theoretically which component controls the outer gap .",
    "if both components illuminate the gap , the core component , which is of a higher temperature than the rim component , is more likely to control the size of the outer gap . on the other hand , with a small effective radius of @xmath104  cm , it is possible that the core component does not illuminate the outer gap . in this respect ,",
    "the x - ray emission of the rim component , whose effective radius @xmath105  cm , has a greater likelihood of illuminating the outer gap . to avoid complexity in the theoretical argument ,",
    "therefore , we only present the case that thermal x - rays from the rim component control the size of the outer gap .",
    "we remark that if the @xmath1-ray emission is controlled by the core component , the predicted @xmath1-ray luminosity is several times smaller than presented here",
    ". however , the main conclusion in this paper will remain unchanged .",
    "the use of the pair - creation condition @xmath106 together with equations  ( [ lcut ] ) and  ( [ trim ] ) leads to the fractional gap thickness controlled by the photon - photon pair - creation process , @xmath107 , as @xmath108 where the typical x - ray photon energy @xmath109 is used .",
    "the @xmath1-ray luminosity ( [ lgamma ] ) and the typical radiation energy  ( [ lcut ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath110 and @xmath111 the total x - ray luminosity  @xmath112 and the temperature of the heated surface are now given by @xmath113 @xmath114 and @xmath115 respectively .    in table  2 , we compare between the observed ( second - fourth columns ) and predicted ( fifth - eighth columns ) x - ray and @xmath1-ray emission properties . for the effective radii of the rim and core components , ( 1 )",
    "we apply the observational value if it is available or ( 2 ) we apply the typical value @xmath116  cm and @xmath117  cm , respectively , if observational results are unavailable .",
    "in addition , we use the curvature radii corresponding to @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "we find in table  2 that the predicted surface temperatures of the rim ( @xmath120  k ) and core components ( @xmath121  k ) are approximately consistent with the observations .",
    "the predicted @xmath1-ray luminosity @xmath122 is consistent with the observations for older msps with @xmath123  yrs , where @xmath124  yrs ( table  1 ) . for the younger msps ( psrs j0218 + 4232 , b1937",
    "+ 21 and b1957 + 20 ) , we find that the outer gap model predicts a @xmath1-ray luminosity one order of magnitude less than that from the @xmath0 observation .",
    "takata et al .",
    "( 2010b ) argued that the incoming particles emit photons with an energy @xmath125 by curvature radiation near the stellar surface .",
    "these photons can become pairs via the magnetic pair creation process and the secondary pairs can continue to radiate several mev photons via synchrotron radiation . in this case , the photon multiplicity can easily exceed @xmath126 per incoming particle . for",
    "a simple dipole field structure , all pairs move inward and can not affect the outer gap accelerator .",
    "however if the local field lines near the surface are bent sideward due to the strong multipole field ( e.g. shown in figure  [ localst1 ] ) , the pairs created in these local magnetic field lines can have an angle greater than 90@xmath127 , which results in an outgoing flow of pairs . only a very tiny fraction ( 1 - 10 ) out of @xmath126 photons",
    "is required to create pairs in these field lines , which are sufficient to provide screening in the outer gap when they migrate to the outer magnetosphere . in this model ,",
    "the fractional gap thickness in this circumstance is @xmath128 where @xmath129 characterizes the local parameters . here ,",
    "@xmath130 and @xmath131 are the local magnetic field in units of @xmath132 g and the local curvature radius in units of @xmath133 cm , respectively .",
    "for the case of msps , the local parameter can be in the range @xmath134 and @xmath135 , which yields @xmath136 of the order of ten .",
    "substituting equation  ( [ fm ] ) into equations  ( [ lgamma ] ) and  ( [ lcut ] ) , we obtain the expected @xmath1-ray luminosity and the typical radiation energy as @xmath137 and @xmath138 respectively , where @xmath139 .",

    ", however , the magnetic pair - creation model predicts @xmath1-ray emission about one order of magnitude brighter than that of the photon - photon pair - creation model in closer agreement with the @xmath0 observation .    for psr  j1614 - 223 ( or j0437 - 4718 ) , the theoretical predictions in tables  2 are found to lie below ( exceed ) the measured value .",
    "this discrepancy may be affected by the local structure , since the @xmath1-ray luminosity described by equation  ( [ mlgamma ] ) is sensitive to the local structure as @xmath143 .",
    "furthermore the uncertainties of the solid angle and the distance may also contribute to these discrepancies . as indicated in table  1",

    "comparing with the expected efficiency @xmath147 for the outer gap model , the actual solid angle and/or distance may be several factors smaller than @xmath145 and/or @xmath146  kpc .",
    "in addition to the local effect and the observational parameters , the observed inefficient @xmath1-ray luminosity of psr  j0437 - 4718 may be a result of an unfavorable viewing angle .",

    ", we can see in figure  [ sigma ] that the luminosity ( solid line ) decreases with decreasing magnetization parameter .",
    "this results from the fact that the x - rays are emitted by the particles in the slow cooling regime and because the magnetic field decreases with decreasing @xmath298 . in the 0.1 - 10  gev band , the luminosity ( dashed - line ) is not sensitive to the magnetization parameter if @xmath363 . for @xmath363 ,",

    "below @xmath364 , we can see in figure  [ sigma ] that the @xmath1-ray luminosity quickly decreases with decreasing magnetization parameter .",
    "this is because the maximum lorentz factor for @xmath365 is limited by @xmath316 , at which the gyroradius is equal to size of the system , and because the spectral cut - off of the synchrotron radiation , @xmath366  mev , appears below 100  mev .    for psr  b1957 + 20 ,",

    "table  3 indicates that the magnitude of the the predicted luminosity by the intra - binary shock model lies below the results of the @xmath0 observations , unless the power law index @xmath371 . for the @xmath1-ray luminosity of psr  j1810 + 17",
    ", the predictions of both the outer gap and intra - binary shock models lie below the observation , implying that the true spin down power may be larger than that assumed using the relation @xmath372 .    due to the uncertainties of the magnetization parameter @xmath298 and the power law index @xmath361 , it is difficult to discriminate between the intra - binary shock model and the outer gap model for the unresolved x - ray emission from the `` black widow '' pulsar , unless the pulsed period is detected in the data .",
    "in addition to the pulsation search , future observations may be able to discriminate between models .",
    "for example , a measurement of the spectral shape in soft / hard x - ray bands and @xmath1-ray bands can discriminate the emission models .",
    "the synchrotron spectrum from the intra - binary shock will extend from @xmath373  ev to @xmath374  mev with a break at @xmath341  mev , implying the observed spectrum can be fit by a single power law function in the soft / hard x - ray bands and by a large photon index above @xmath375  mev .",
    "for the outer gap model , on the other hand , the spectral break will appear at @xmath334kev corresponding to the synchrotron radiation from the secondary pairs , as was discussed in section  [ nonx ] , and at @xmath334gev corresponding to the curvature radiation in the outer gap . the observed soft x - ray spectrum with a index @xmath303 , such as the x - ray emission of psr  b1957 + 20 ( huang & becker 2007 ) , may support the intra - binary shock , although the possibility that the spectrum with a cut - off energy @xmath334 kev predicted by the outer gap model can not be excluded .",
    "finally , we would like to remark that ( i ) many new black widow systems will be associated with the @xmath0 un - identified sources and ( ii ) those systems will exhibit an eclipse of the radio emission .",
    "first , because of the radio eclipse , it is likely that many black widow systems have been missed by the previous radio surveys with the shorter observations . on the other hand ,",
    "the msps in the black widow systems are younger and have higher spin - down power .",
    "this indicates that the msps in the black window systems have larger @xmath1-ray luminosity , @xmath211 [ equation  ( [ lgamma ] ) ] , than ordinary msps .",
    "accumulating data of the @xmath0 observation will enable us to detect the @xmath1-ray emissions from the black widow systems .",
    "in particular , the population studies ( e.g. kaaret & philip 1996 ; faucher - gigu@xmath376re & loeb 2010 ; takata et al .",
    "2011a , b , c ) have pointed out that unidentified msps will be associated with the @xmath1-ray sources located at higher galactic latitude ; for example , takata et al .",
    "( 2011a , b , c ) argued statistically that the distribution of the high galactic latitude of the msps of the @xmath0 un - identified sources that manifest the spectral properties similar to the pulsars can be explained by the distribution of the msps .",
    "second , because the @xmath1-ray emission from the outer gap is greater in the direction perpendicular to the spin axis , @xmath0 is more likely to discover a greater number of msps with the earth viewing angle @xmath377 measured from the rotation axis ( takata , et al .",
    "2010b ; takata , et al.2011c ) .",
    "if the angular momentum transferred from the accreting matter to the neutron star in the accreting stage produces the pulsar s spin axis perpendicular to the orbital plane , the @xmath1-ray emissions from msps in black widow will be greater in the orbital plane .",
    "hence , @xmath0 will find the black widow systems with the earth viewing angle described by edge - on rather than by face - on with respect to the orbital plane .",
    "in such a case , a greater number of the @xmath0 black window systems will reveal eclipses of the radio emissions by the matter ejected from the companion star .",
    "with the recent accumulation of evidence for non - thermal x - ray and @xmath1-ray emissions from different evolutionary stages of msps , we have investigated the high - energy emission processes of isolated rotation powered msps and those in binary systems . to understand their observational properties ,",
    "the high - energy emission associated with the outer gap accelerator and with the intra - binary shock in the binary system has been investigated .    for the @xmath1-ray emitting msps ,",
    "the polar cap region is heated by incoming particles accelerated in the outer gap .",
    "these particles emit @xmath375mev photons near the stellar surface which irradiate the polar cap region , eventually impacting on the stellar surface .",
    "the former and latter heating processes are identified with the rim component characterized by @xmath378 and the core component @xmath379 , respectively . for the outer gap model , the emission properties",
    "are controlled by either the photon - photon pair - creation process between x - rays from the heated polar cap and the @xmath1-rays or the magnetic pair - creation near the stellar surface .",
    "it has been found , based on the statistical grounds , that the outer gap controlled by the magnetic pair - creation process near the stellar surface ( takata et al .",
    "2010b ) is preferable in explaining the possible correlations in @xmath150 vs. @xmath380 ( or @xmath381 and @xmath382 vs. @xmath380 .    for the amp in the quiescent state of lmxbs",
    ", the observed modulation of the optical emissions and/or the non - thermal x - ray emission suggests the presence of rotation powered activities during this state .",
    "the thermal x - ray emission at the neutron star surface resulting from deep crustal heating can control the gap and , hence , the @xmath1-ray emission properties .",
    "we find that if the optical modulation originates from the irradiation of @xmath1-rays from the outer gap , the observed amplitude can constrain the ns model .",
    "for example , the level of the inferred irradiation luminosity @xmath229 of sax  j1808.4 - 3658 suggests that the outer gap with a high - mass ns model is preferable . as argued by takata et al .",
    "( 2010a ) , the presence of the outer gap emission would be responsible for the transition of the system from the lmxb phase to the rotation powered msp phase .",
    "finally , we have discussed the high - energy emission from an intra - binary shock in the black widow systems , which are frequently found from radio searches of @xmath0 unidentified sources . within the context of the simple one - zone model , we calculate the synchrotron emission from the accelerated particles at the shock . for psr  b1957 + 20 , the observed non - pulsed x - ray emission ( @xmath383 )",
    "can be explained by the intra - binary shock model if the magnetization parameter is @xmath384 .",
    "in addition , it is found that the observed luminosity of the pulsed @xmath1-ray emission from psr  b1957 + 20 can be explained by the outer gap model . on the other hand ,",
    "the 0.1 - 10  gev emissions from the intra - binary shock is several orders of magnitude smaller than that from the outer gap emission , unless the magnetization parameter and the power law index of the accelerated particles are @xmath385 and @xmath371 , respectively . for the other black widow systems detected from @xmath0 unidentified sources ,",
    "the predicted luminosity from the intra - binary shock model is consistent with the @xmath0 observations only if the power law index @xmath371 .",
    "in addition to the pulse search , the origin of the high - energy emissions from black widow systems will be constrained by a measurement of the spectral shape by new studies in the soft / hard x - ray bands , for example , by the astro - h satellite , ( takahashi et al .",

    "<S> the @xmath0-lat has revealed that rotation powered millisecond pulsars ( msps ) are a major contributor to the galactic @xmath1-ray source population . such pulsars may also be important in modeling the quiescent state of several low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , where optical observations of the companion star suggest the possible existence of rotation powered msps . to understand the observational properties of the different evolutionary stages of msps , the x - ray and @xmath1-ray emission associated with the outer gap model is investigated . for rotation powered msps , </S>",
    "<S> the size of the outer gap and the properties of the high - energy emission are controlled by either the photon - photon pair - creation process or magnetic pair - creation process near the surface . for these pulsars </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the outer gap model controlled by the magnetic pair - creation process is preferable in explaining the possible correlations between the @xmath1-ray luminosity or non - thermal x - ray luminosity versus the spin down power . </S>",
    "<S> for the accreting msps in quiescent lmxbs , the thermal x - ray emission at the neutron star surface resulting from deep crustal heating can control the conditions in the outer gap . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the optical modulation observed in the quiescent state of several lmxbs originates from the irradiation of the donor star by @xmath1-rays from the outer gap . in these systems , </S>",
    "<S> the irradiation luminosity required for the optical modulation of the source such as sax  j1808.4 - 3658 can be achieved for a neutron star of high mass . finally , </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the high - energy emission associated with an intra - binary shock in black widow systems , e.g. psr b1957 + 20 . </S>"
