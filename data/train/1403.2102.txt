    "a large part of the visible matter in our universe is made up of protons and neutrons , collectively called hadrons .",
    "hadrons are made up of more fundamental particles called quarks and gluons .",
    "the quantum theory for these particles is quantum chromodynamics(qcd ) .",
    "qcd is a strongly interacting theory and the strength of interaction becomes vanishingly small only at asymptotically high energies . due to this reason ,",
    "the quarks and gluons are not visible directly in our world and remain confined within the hadrons .",
    "lattice gauge theory has emerged as the most successful non - perturbative tool to study qcd , with very precise lattice results available for hadron masses and decay constants which are in excellent agreement with the experimental values  @xcite .",
    "it is expected that at high enough temperatures that existed in the early universe , the hadrons would melt into a quark gluon plasma(qgp ) phase .",
    "signatures of such a phase have been seen during the last decade in the heavy ion collision experiments at the relativistic heavy ion collider(rhic ) , in brookhaven national laboratory this is particularly exciting for the lattice theory community which has been predicting such a phase transition since a long time @xcite .",
    "the formation of the qgp phase occurs at temperatures near @xmath0 , where qcd is strongly interacting , which means lattice is the most reliable tool to understand the properties of the hot qcd medium . over the past three decades ,",
    "the lattice community has contributed significantly to the understanding of the physics of heavy ion experiments and strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions , in general .",
    "lattice computations are entering into the precision regime , where lattice data can be directly used for interpreting the experimental results and set benchmarks for the heavy ion experiments at rhic and at the alice facility in cern .",
    "it is now generally believed that the hot and dense matter created due to the collision of two heavy nuclei at rhic and alice , equilibrates within 1 fm / c of the initial impact .",
    "the equilibrated qgp medium then expands and cools down in the process , ultimately forming hadrons at the chemical freezeout .",
    "the evolution of the fireball from its equilibration till the chemical freezeout is described by relativistic hydrodynamics  @xcite .",
    "the qcd equation of state(eos ) is an input for the hydrodynamic equations and lattice can provide a non - perturbative estimate of this quantity from first principles .",
    "the lattice data for the speed of sound in the qcd medium is also an important input for the hydrodynamic study , once bulk viscosity is considered .    in this article ,",
    "i have selected the most recent results form lattice qcd thermodynamics that are relevant for the heavy ion phenomenology .",
    "i have tried to review the necessary background , but not attempted to provide a comprehensive account of the development of the subject throughout these years .",
    "i have divided this article into two major sections .",
    "the first section deals with qcd at finite temperature and zero baryon density , where lattice methods are very robust .",
    "i have given a basic introduction to the lattice techniques , and how the continuum limit is taken , which is essential to relate the lattice data with the real world experiments .",
    "i have discussed the current understanding we have of the nature of qcd phase transition as a function of quark masses , inferred from lattice studies .",
    "subsequently the different aspects of the hot qcd medium for physical quark masses are discussed ; the eos , the nature and the temperature of transition and the behaviour of various thermodynamic observables in the different phases . in the study of thermodynamics ,",
    "the contribution of the lighter u , d and s quarks are usually considered .",
    "the effect of heavier charm quarks on qcd thermodynamics is discussed in this section , in view of their relevance for the heavy ion experiments at lhc , where hydrodynamic evolution is expected to set in already at temperatures about 500 mev and also for the physics of early universe .",
    "the relevance of chiral symmetry for the qcd phase diagram and the effects of chiral anomaly are discussed in detail .",
    "the chiral anomaly is believed to have an important role in shaping the phase diagram and several lattice studies in the recent years are trying to understand its effect .",
    "it is a difficult problem and i have tried to compile the recent results and review the general understanding within the community , about how to improve upon them .",
    "the second section is about lattice qcd at finite density , where there is an inherent short - coming of the lattice algorithms due to the so - called sign problem .",
    "a brief overview of the different methods used and those being developed by the lattice practitioners to circumvent this problem , is given .",
    "it is an active field of research , with a lot of understanding of the origin and the severity of this problem gained in recent years , which is motivating the search for its possible cure . in the regime where the density of baryons is not too large , which is being probed by the experiments at rhic",
    ", lattice techniques have been used successfully to produce some interesting results .",
    "one such important proposal in the recent time , is the first principles determination of the chemical freezeout curve using experimental data on the electric charge fluctuations .",
    "this and the lattice results on the fluctuations of different quantum numbers in the hot medium and the eos at finite baryon density are discussed in detail . an important feature of the qcd phase diagram is the possible presence of a critical end - point for the chiral first order transition . since critical end - point search is one of the main objectives at rhic , i have reviewed the current lattice results on this topic .",
    "the presence of the critical end - point is still not conclusively proven from lattice studies .",
    "it is a very challenging problem and i mention about the further work in progress to address this problem effectively .",
    "fermions with exact chiral symmetry on the lattice are important in this context .",
    "i have discussed the recent successful development to construct fermion operators that have exact chiral symmetry even at finite density which would be important for future studies on the critical end - point .",
    "the signatures of the critical end - point could be detected in the experiments if the critical region is not separated from the freezeout curve .",
    "it is thus very crucial to estimate the curvature of the critical line from first principles and i devote an entire subsection to discuss the lattice results on this topic .",
    "i apologize for my inability to include all the pioneering works that have firmly established this subject and also to review the extensive set of interesting contemporary works . for a comprehensive review of the current activity in lattice thermodynamics , at finite temperature and density ,",
    "i refer to the excellent review talks of the lattice conference , 2012 @xcite .",
    "the starting point of any thermodynamic study is the partition function .",
    "the qcd partition function for @xmath1 flavours of quarks in the canonical ensemble is given as , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the fermion operator for each flavour of quark @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath5 is the gauge link defined as @xmath6 in terms of gauge fields @xmath7 , which are adjoint representation of the @xmath8 color group and @xmath9 is the strength of the gauge coupling .",
    "@xmath10 is the gluon action in euclidean space of finite temporal extent of size denoted by the inverse of the temperature of the system , @xmath11 .",
    "lattice qcd involves discretizing the spacetime into a lattice with a spacing denoted by @xmath12 .",
    "the volume of the lattice is given as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 are the number of lattice sites along the spatial directions and the temperature being @xmath15 , where @xmath16 are the number of sites along the temporal direction .",
    "the lattice is usually denoted as @xmath17 .",
    "the gluon action and the fermion determinant are discretized on the lattice .",
    "the simplest gluon action , known as wilson plaquette action is of the form , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is called a plaquette .",
    "the naive discretization of the continuum dirac equation on the lattice results in the fermion operator of the form , @xmath20.\\ ] ] where in each of the expressions the site index runs from @xmath21 to @xmath17 .",
    "the discretization of the gluon and fermion operators are not unique and there are several choices which give the correct continuum limit .",
    "usually discretized operators with small finite @xmath12 corrections are preferred . reducing @xmath12-dependent corrections by adding suitable `` irrelevant '' terms in the renormalization group(rg ) sense ,",
    "is known as improvement of the operator .",
    "another issue related to the discretization of the fermion operator is called as the `` fermion doubling problem '' .",
    "it arises because the naive discretization of the continuum fermion operator introduces extra unphysical fermion species called the doublers .",
    "the existence of the doublers can be traced back to a no - go theorem @xcite on the lattice which states that fermion actions which are ultra - local , have exact chiral symmetry , and have the correct continuum limit , can not be free from the doublers .",
    "doublers are problematic since in the continuum limit we would get a theory with 16 fermion species and qcd with 16 flavours is very close to the upper bound of the number of flavours beyond which the asymptotic freedom is lost .",
    "it is thus important to ensure that the discrete fermion operator should be free of the doublers . in order to do so",
    "the chiral symmetry is explicitly broken on the lattice , like for the case of wilson fermions @xcite , or only a remnant of it is preserved for the staggered fermions @xcite .",
    "the staggered fermion discretization retains the doubling problem in a milder form . in the continuum limit",
    ", the staggered fermion determinant would give contribution of four degenerate fermion species or tastes .",
    "however on a finite lattice , there is a considerable mixing among the tastes so a simple fourth root of the determinant would not yield the contribution of a single fermion flavour .",
    "this is called the rooting problem .",
    "the severity of rooting problem can be minimized by choosing either the stout - smeared staggered quarks  @xcite or the highly improved staggered quarks(hisq )  @xcite .",
    "other improved versions of staggered fermions used for qcd thermodynamics are the p4 and asqtad fermions  @xcite . only the overlap @xcite and the domain wall fermions @xcite have exact chiral symmetry on the lattice at the expense of breaking the ultra - locality condition of the nielsen - ninomiya no - go theorem . as a result overlap and domain wall fermions",
    "are much more expensive to simulate compared to the staggered and the wilson fermions . for qcd thermodynamics , the staggered and to some extent the wilson fermions are favourites , with very high precision data available with improved versions of staggered quarks @xcite . with the advent of faster computing resources and smarter algorithms , even large scale simulations with chiral fermions are becoming a reality @xcite .    with the choice of a suitable gauge and the fermion operators on the lattice ,",
    "different physical observables are measured on statistically independent configurations generated using suitable monte - carlo algorithms . to make connection with the continuum physics",
    ", one needs to take the @xmath22 limit of the observables measured on the lattice .",
    "the gauge coupling is related to the lattice spacing through the beta - function and the continuum limit , in turn , implies @xmath23 . in the space of coupling constants and the fermion masses ,",
    "the continuum limit is a second order fixed point and the approach to the fixed point should be done along the correct rg trajectory or the lines of constant physics .",
    "the line of constant physics is defined by setting the mass of hadrons on the lattice to the continuum values , at each value of the coupling constant .",
    "the number of such relations required depends on the number of fermion flavours . to relate the lattice hadron masses to their experimental values",
    ", one has to define a scale to express the lattice spacing @xmath12 , in terms of some physical units .",
    "there are two often used methods in qcd to set the scale , using the quantities @xmath24 and the kaon decay constant @xmath25 .",
    "the @xmath24 scale is defined from the quark - antiquark potential @xmath26 , as , @xmath27 on the lattice one measures @xmath26 and @xmath24 is extracted from it using a suitable fit ansatz for the potential . to quantify the value of @xmath24 in physical units ,",
    "one uses either the pion decay constant or the splitting of energy levels of bottom mesons to set the lattice spacing  @xcite .",
    "advantages of this scale is that it is not sensitive to fermion discretization effects and to the choice of quark masses that defines the line of constant physics .",
    "however , the accurate determination of the potential requires very good statistics .",
    "one can also set the scale by choosing the @xmath25 measured on the lattice to its physical value .",
    "the @xmath25 is known with very high accuracy from the experiments .",
    "once the line of constant physics is set , one has to take care of the finite size and lattice spacing effects such that the continuum extrapolation is correctly performed . to minimize such corrections ,",
    "the correlation length which is given by the inverse of the mass of the lowest excitation of the system should be much larger that the lattice spacing but sufficiently smaller than the spatial size . also for thermodynamics , it is crucial to minimize finite volume corrections which is ensured for the choice @xmath28 , where @xmath29 .    to characterize different phases one needs to define a suitable order parameter which depends on the symmetries of the theory . in the limit of infinitely heavy quark masses",
    "qcd is just a pure gauge theory with an exact order parameter , the expectation value of the polyakov loop given as , @xmath30 the phase transition from a phase of confined colour degrees of freedom to the deconfined regime of free gluons , is of first order and is established very firmly from lattice studies @xcite .",
    "the corresponding transition temperature is @xmath31(pure - gauge)@xmath32 mev @xcite using the string tension , @xmath33 , value to be 425 mev , to set the scale .",
    "if the quarks are massless , the qcd partition function with @xmath1 quark flavours has an exact @xmath34 chiral symmetry . at some temperature ,",
    "there is a phase transition from a chiral symmetry broken phase to the symmetry restored phase , characterized by the order parameter called the chiral condensate , @xmath35 the phase transition in the chiral limit for @xmath36 , is expected to be of first order and there are several lattice results supporting this @xcite . for @xmath37 ,",
    "the lattice results are contradictory with some claiming a first order transition @xcite whereas recent results showing that the second order transition is also a possibility @xcite .",
    "the current status of @xmath37 qcd phase transition in the chiral limit would be discussed again in a later subsection . for any finite value of quark masses",
    ", however there is no unique order parameter and no sharp phase transition is expected but only a gradual crossover .",
    "based on effective field theories with same symmetries as qcd , using universality arguments and renormalization group inspired techniques , a schematic diagram of different phases of qcd as a function of quark mass is summarized in the famous `` columbia plot '' @xcite .",
    "the first order regions in the quenched and the chiral limits are separated from the cross - over region by second order lines belonging to the @xmath38 universality class .",
    "these boundaries are schematic , though , and it is important to estimate the precise location of the physical point in this diagram .",
    "lattice studies over the years have helped to redraw the boundaries more quantitatively .",
    "a latest version of the `` columbia plot '' is shown in figure [ colplot ] . with the high precision lattice data with physical light and strange quark masses",
    ", it is now known that the qcd transition in our world is a crossover @xcite .",
    "the boundary of the first order region in the upper right hand corner of figure [ colplot ] is fairly well known @xcite . the extent of the first order region in the bottom left hand is now believed to be small and much far away from the physical point @xcite",
    ". however the extent of the @xmath38 line in the left hand corner is still not well established ; it can either continue along the @xmath39 axis to the @xmath40 corner or end at a tricritical point .",
    "a better understanding of this issue is currently underway .",
    "the key to the resolution of this issue is to understand the effects of chiral anomaly through rigorous lattice computations . since the light u",
    ", d - quark masses are much smaller than @xmath0 , the qcd action has an approximate @xmath41 symmetry with an additional classical @xmath42 symmetry broken explicitly by quantum effects .",
    "this is known as the @xmath42 anomaly @xcite . at zero temperature ,",
    "the magnitude of this anomaly is related to the instanton - density .",
    "if the magnitude of this anomaly is temperature independent , the phase transition along the @xmath39 axes has to be of second order , belonging to the @xmath43 universality class @xcite .",
    "this would mean that the @xmath38 line has to end at a tri - critical point characterized by the strange quark mass , @xmath44 .",
    "the difference between the physical and tri - critical mass for the strange quark is not yet known with a good precision .        in the following subsections ,",
    "the lattice results for the qcd eos for physical quark masses are discussed , which is an input for the hydrodynamics of the qgp medium .",
    "the current results on the pseudo - critical temperature , the entropy density , the speed of sound are also shown .",
    "all the results are for @xmath45 flavour qcd , i.e. , two light degenerate u and d quarks and a heavier strange quark mass .",
    "the effect of the heavy charm quarks on the thermodynamic quantities is also highlighted . at the end of this section",
    ", i touch upon the @xmath37 qcd near the chiral limit and the effects of the @xmath42 anomaly for qcd thermodynamics .",
    "the equation of state(eos ) is the relation between the pressure and energy density of a system in thermal equilibrium .",
    "for estimating the qcd eos , the most frequently used method by the lattice practitioners is the integral method @xcite . in this method ,",
    "one first computes the trace anomaly @xmath46 , which is the trace of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "this is equal to the quantity @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the energy density of the system and @xmath49 is the pressure .",
    "moreover it is related to the pressure of the system through the following relation @xmath50 so if @xmath46 is known , the pressure can be computed by integrating @xmath46 over a range of temperature , with the lower value of temperature chosen such that the corresponding value of pressure is vanishingly small .",
    "the trace anomaly is related to the chiral condensate and the gluon action as , @xmath51 where the subscript zero denotes the vacuum expectation values of the corresponding quantities .",
    "the subtraction is necessary to remove the zero temperature ultraviolet divergences and the vacuum expectation values are usually computed on a lattice with number of sites @xmath52 in the temporal direction , equal to the corresponding spatial number of sites , @xmath14 .",
    "the subtraction is an unavoidable expense of this method .",
    "a new idea of deriving thermodynamic observables from cumulants of momentum distribution has emerged , where the vacuum subtraction is not required  @xcite and it would be interesting to check the application of this method in qcd . also one needs to know the functional dependence of the inverse of qcd coupling constant @xmath53 and the quark masses with the lattice spacing @xmath12 along the line of constant physics . on the lattice , @xmath46 is known only for a finite number of temperature values .",
    "the pressure computed by the numerical integration of the @xmath46 data , has errors both due to statistical fluctuations and systematic uncertainties involved in the numerical interpolation of the data .",
    "the results for the trace anomaly are available for different lattice discretizations of the fermions .",
    "for staggered quarks there are two sets of results , one from the hotqcd collaboration using hisq discretization @xcite and the other from the budapest - wuppertal collaboration using stout smeared staggered quarks @xcite . these results are compiled in figures [ intmeashisq ] , [ intmeasbw ] . for the hisq results ,",
    "the bare lattice parameters are fixed by setting the lowest strange pseudo - scalar meson mass to its physical value at about 686 mev and @xmath54 mev , which defines the line of constant physics .",
    "the kaon decay constant @xmath55 mev or alternatively the @xmath56 fm from the static quark potential is used to set the scale .",

    "one approach is to monitor the behaviour of the thermodynamic observables in the transition region for physical values of quark masses while the other is to map out the chiral critical line as a function of light quark mass  @xcite .",
    "the absence of a sharp phase transition implies that there is no unique transition temperature but only different pseudo - critical temperatures corresponding to different observables .",
    "there is no order parameter but the observables like the renormalized polyakov loop , @xmath71 has a point of inflexion across the crossover region .",

    "the hisq data are in good agreement with the continuum extrapolated stout - smeared staggered results from @xcite .",
    "the fact that the rise of @xmath71 is more gradual than the corresponding rise of @xmath77 signals that the crossover is more likely influenced by the chiral symmetry restoration .",

    "the line of constant physics was set such that the ratios @xmath83 and @xmath84 are within 3% of the corresponding values for the wilson fermions .",
    "this means that the pions are quite heavy with @xmath85 mev for both these discretizations .",
    "the continuum extrapolated results for @xmath71 and the renormalized chiral condensate are shown in figure [ wil ] .",

    "in all these computations an improved wilson operator was used , in which the dominant @xmath86 correction terms due to explicit breaking of chiral symmetry by these fermions were cancelled .",
    "it ensured that in both the studies the approach to the continuum limit was chosen to be the same .",
    "however at this large value of quark masses , the rooting problem may be mild enough to show any adverse effects and it would be desirable to perform a similar comparison at physical value of the quark masses .        since the effects of chiral symmetry persist in the cross - over region , it is important to compare the existing results for @xmath31 with those using fermions with exact chiral symmetry on the lattice . for the wilson and the staggered action , even for massless quarks ,",
    "the full @xmath87 chiral symmetry is realized only in the continuum limit . for chiral fermions on the lattice , like the overlap or the domain wall fermions , the chiral and the continuum limits",

    "the rise in these thermodynamic quantities is expected to be much steeper .",
    "the value of @xmath31 estimated from the peak of the chiral susceptibility i.e the derivative of the chiral condensate is between 160 - 170 mev which is consistent with the continuum results from the hisq fermions .",

    ", one can infer about the degrees of freedom of the different phases and the nature of the interactions among the constituents .",
    "it was already known from an important lattice study that the pressure in high temperature phase of qcd showed a strong dependence on the number of quark flavours  @xcite , signaling deconfinement of the quark and gluon degrees of freedom .",
    "recent results for the pressure , entropy density and the speed of sound for qcd , using the stout - smeared staggered quarks are compiled in figure [ obsv ] .",

    "similarly , if @xmath192 is known from the experiments , @xmath185 can be accurately estimated and is expected to be different from the current hrg estimates .",
    "this is not very surprising because the freezeout of the fluctuations happens due to diffusive processes and is due to a different mechanism from the freezeout of hadrons due to decreasing probability of inelastic collisions .",

    "reweighting becomes more expensive with increasing volume of the lattice , so going to a larger lattice seems difficult with this method .",

    "( [ eqn : series ] ) , for each value of temperature .",
    "the baryon number susceptibility is expected to diverge at the critical end - point  @xcite , so the radius of convergence of the series would give the location of the critical end - point  @xcite .",

    "it was observed that for @xmath254 , at least the 8th order taylor coefficient is necessary for a good fit .",
    "this highlights the necessity to evaluate higher order susceptibilities , beyond the currently measured eighth order in the studies of eos or the critical end - point .",
    "new ideas to extend the taylor series to higher order susceptibilities are evolving  @xcite and these should be explored in full qcd simulations .",

    "the eos would be available in very near future , with consistency already observed for different discretizations .",
    "the lattice community has opened the door for a very active collaboration between the theorists and experimentalists . with the eos as an input",
    ", one can study the phenomenology of the hot and dense matter created at the heavy ion colliders . on the hand , there is a proposal of non - perturbative determination of the freezeout curve using lattice techniques , once the experimental data on cumulants of the charged hadrons are available .    a good understanding of the qcd phase diagram at zero baryon density has been achieved from the lattice studies . while the early universe transition from the qgp to the hadron phase is now known to be an analytic crossover and not a real phase transition , it is observed that the chiral dynamics will have observable effects in the crossover region .",
    "one of the remnant effects of the chiral symmetry would be the presence of a critical end - point .",
    "the search for the still elusive critical endpoint is one of the focus areas of lattice studies , and the important developments made so far in this area are reviewed .",
    "while qcd at small baryon density is reasonably well understood with lattice techniques , the physics of baryon rich systems can not be formulated satisfactorily on the lattice due to the infamous sign - problem .",
