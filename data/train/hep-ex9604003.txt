    "the hera @xmath8 collider has been designed to study deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) at very high @xmath7 where substructure of quarks could be observed .",
    "however in the first 3 years of data operation , which allowed a steady growth towards the design luminosity of the machine , most of the interest has focused on the study of low @xmath6 , low @xmath7 dis , where new tests of perturbative qcd can be performed .",
    "the first observations on the 1992 data showed a rise of the proton structure function @xmath0 at low @xmath9 with decreasing @xmath6  @xcite , which was confirmed with the more precise data of 1993 @xcite .",
    "such a behaviour is qualitatively expected in the double leading log limit of quantum chromodynamics  @xcite .",
    "it is , however , not clarified whether the linear qcd evolution equations , as the conventional dglap evolution  @xcite in @xmath10 and/or the bfkl evolution  @xcite in @xmath11 , describe the rise of @xmath5 or whether there is a significant effect due to nonlinear parton recombination @xcite . at low @xmath7 ( @xmath12 5 gev@xmath2 ) the new results can be confronted to regge inspired models , which expects a rather flat behaviour as a function of @xmath6 , in order to study the transition between dis and photoproduction .",
    "the 1994 data have allowed to reach @xmath7=1.5 gev@xmath2 and confirm the persistance of the rise at low @xmath6 .",
    "the measurements have been achieved by using dedicated data samples ( sect .",
    "2 ) and are discussed and analyzed in terms of perturbative qcd in sect .",
    "in 1994 both experiments have reduced the minimum @xmath7 at which they could measure @xmath5 using several techniques : i ) both experiments were able to diminish the region around the backward beam pipe in which the electron could not be measured reliably in 93 , thus increasing the maximum polar angle of the scattered electron ( measured w.r.t .",
    "to proton beam direction ) .",
    "this large statistic    sample , taken with the nominal hera conditions has an integrated luminosity of about 3  pb@xmath13 .",
    "ii ) an integrated luminosity of @xmath14 60  nb@xmath13 of data was collected for which the interaction point was shifted by + 62  cm , in the forward direction , resulting in an increase of the electron acceptance ( so - called `` shifted vertex '' data sample ) .",
    "iii ) both experiments used dis events which underwent initial state photon radiation detected in an appropriate photon tagger to measure @xmath5 at lower @xmath7 ( so called `` radiative '' sample ) .",
    "the incident electron energy which participate in the hard scattering is thus reduced , and so is the @xmath7 .",
    "the luminosity was determined from the measured cross section of the bethe - heitler reaction @xmath15 , measuring the hard photon bremsstrahlung data only .",
    "the precision of the luminosity measurement is 1.5% ( 3.9% for the shifted vertex data ) .",
    "the kinematic variables of the inclusive scattering process @xmath16 can be reconstructed in different ways using measured quantities from the hadronic final state and from the scattered electron .",
    "the choice of the reconstruction method for @xmath7 and @xmath17 determines the size of systematic errors , acceptance and radiative corrections .",
    "the measurements presented here have been obtained with the electron ( e ) and with the @xmath18 methods  @xcite for which the @xmath17 , @xmath7 and @xmath6 formulae are @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the four - momentum vector components of each particle , @xmath21 is the electron beam energy , @xmath22 the squared center of mass energy of the collision , @xmath23 and the summation is done over all hadronic final state particles neglecting their masses .",
    "the e method , which is independent of the hadronic final state , apart from the requirement that the interaction vertex is reconstructed using the final state hadrons , has at large @xmath17 the best resolution in @xmath6 and @xmath7 but needs sizeable radiative corrections . at low @xmath17 the e method is not applied due to the degradation of the @xmath24 resolution as @xmath25 .",
    "the @xmath18 method , which has small radiative corrections , relies mostly on the hadronic measurement which has still an acceptable resolution at low @xmath17 values and can be used from very low to large @xmath17 values .",
    "h1 measures @xmath5 with the e and the @xmath18 method and after a complete consistency check , in particular at low @xmath6 , uses the e method for @xmath26 and the @xmath18 method for @xmath27 .",
    "zeus measures @xmath5 at low @xmath7 with the e method .",
    "the event selection is similar in the two experiments .",
    "events are filtered on - line using calorimetric triggers which request an electromagnetic cluster of at least 5  gev not vetoed by a trigger element signing a beam background event .",
    "offline , further electron identification criteria are applied ( track - cluster link , shower shape and radius ) and a minimum energy of 8(11 )  gev is requested in zeus(h1 ) .",
    "h1 requests a reconstructed vertex within 3@xmath28 of the expected interaction position , while zeus requires that the quantity @xmath29 satisfies 35  gev @xmath30 65  gev .",
    "if no particle escapes detection , @xmath31 55  gev , so the @xmath32 cut reduces the photoproduction background and the size of the radiative corrections . the only significant background left after the selection comes from photoproduction in which a hadronic shower or a photon fakes an electron . in h1 for instance , it has been estimated consistently both from the data and from monte carlo simulation and amounts to less than 3% except in a few bins where it can reach values up to 15% .",
    "it is subtracted statistically bin by bin and an error of 30% is assigned to it .",
    "the acceptance and the response of the detector has been studied and understood in great detail by the two experiments : more than two millions monte carlo dis events were generated using django  @xcite and different quark distribution parametrizations , corresponding to an integrated luminosity of approximately @xmath33  pb@xmath13 .",
    "the program is based on heracles  @xcite for the electroweak interaction and on lepto  @xcite and ariadne  @xcite to simulate the hadronic final state .",
    "heracles includes first order radiative corrections , the simulation of real bremsstrahlung photons and the longitudinal structure function .",
    "for the parton densities , the grv  @xcite and the mrs parametrizations  @xcite were used .",
    "the monte carlo events , after a detailed simulation based on the geant program , were subject to the same reconstruction and analysis chain as the real data .",
    "the structure function @xmath0 was derived after radiative corrections from the one - photon exchange cross section since effects due to @xmath34 boson exchange are smaller than 1% at low @xmath7 . @xmath35",
    "the ratio @xmath36 was calculated using the qcd relation  @xcite . with the different data sets",
    "available detailed cross checks could be made in the kinematic regions of overlap .",
    "the results were found to be in very good agreement with each other for all kinematic reconstruction methods used , and the effect of systematic errors could be monitored : for the e method the main source of error are the energy calibration ( known at the 1% level ) , the knowledge of the electron identification efficiency , the error on the polar angle of the scattered electron , ( @xmath371mrad ) and the radiative corrections at low @xmath6 . for the @xmath18 method , the knowledge of the absolute energy scale for the hadrons , the fraction of hadrons which stay undetected in particular at low @xmath6 , due to calorimetric thresholds and to a lesser extent the electron energy calibration are the dominating factors .",
    "further uncertainties common to all methods ( selection , structure function dependence etc . ) were also taken into account .",
    "the total @xmath5 errors on the 1994 data ranges between 5 to 10% in the 10 - 100 gev@xmath2 range and between 10 to 20% below 10 gev@xmath2 .",
    "the final results on the 1994 data of h1 and zeus are shown in fig .",
    "[ lowq2 ] in the new kinematic domain reached using the radiative and the shifted vertex data .",
    "compared to the 1993 data analyses the @xmath5 measurement has been extended to lower @xmath6 ( from @xmath38 to @xmath39 ) and @xmath7 ( from @xmath40  gev@xmath2 to @xmath41  gev@xmath2 ) .",
    "both experiments are in good agreement and show that the @xmath5 rise at low @xmath6 persist , albeit less strongly , down to the lowest measured @xmath7=1.5 gev@xmath2 . a smooth transition to the fixed target experiments e665  @xcite and nmc  @xcite",
    "is observed with the low @xmath17 results of h1 , allowing to confront all these results to theoretical expectations .",
    "in fig .  [ lowq2 ] are also shown the extrapolations of the @xmath5 parametrizations based on some theoretical model fitted to the previous data .",
    "they can be divided in two categories : one , motivated by regge theory , assumes a pomeron exchange as a dynamical basis and successfully describes the behaviour of the total cross - sections of photoproduction and hadron - hadron collisions ; the other is based on perturbative qcd and is known to well describe the dis regime , but is expected to break down for a given @xmath6 at some low @xmath7 .",
    "the regge models were expected to work at least at low @xmath7 , but the dola parametrization which uses a `` soft '' pomeron ( intercept@xmath42 1.08 )  @xcite largely underestimate @xmath5 at low @xmath6 even at 1.5 gev@xmath2 .",
    "the ckmt model  @xcite , which assumes that in the present @xmath7 range the `` bare '' pomeron becomes visible and has a higher trajectory intercept ( @xmath43 ) , predicts a weaker rise at low @xmath6 than observed , except maybe at 1.5 gev@xmath2 .",
    "these comparisons underline the difference between the behaviour of the total cross - section of real and virtual photons , since in the hera kinematic domain and using the hand  @xcite definition of the photon flux @xmath44 can be expressed as @xmath45 the parametrizations based on the dglap qcd evolution equations describe the data remarkably well , as expected above 5 - 10 gev@xmath2 , but surprizingly at values around 1 or 2 gev@xmath2 where non - perturbative effects were believed to distort the dglap picture .",
    "the mrsa parametrizations of the parton densities are defined at @xmath46 4 gev@xmath2 , then evolved in @xmath7 and fitted to previous experimental data , including the 1993 hera data . the agreement observed above 10 gev@xmath2 confirms that the 1993 and 1994 hera results are compatible . between 1.5 and 10 gev@xmath2",
    "the good description tells us that within the present precision perturbative qcd can be applied in this range .",
    "more striking is the confirmation of the pre - hera prediction of the @xmath5    rise at low @xmath6 by the grv model  @xcite which conjectured at a very low energy scale ( @xmath47=0.34 gev@xmath2 ) that the proton is formed by valence - like partons as shown in fig .",
    "[ glugrv ] and that the dglap equations can be applied to generate `` radiatively '' the rise of the gluon and sea - quark density at low @xmath6 , when evolving towards higher @xmath7 .",
    "the h1 and zeus results are very well described by the grv model at low @xmath7 as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ lowq2 ] but also in the full hera kinematic range , from 1.5 to 5000 gev@xmath2  @xcite .",
    "this success support the idea that the rise at low @xmath6 is a direct consquence of the dglap equations , and that non - perturbative effects are relatively weak at low @xmath6 and low @xmath7 .",
    "the evolution with @xmath7 of the strength of the rise can be quantified by fitting an @xmath48 ( or equivalently a @xmath49 , @xmath50 being the invariant mass of the @xmath51 system ) function at fixed @xmath7 to @xmath52 .",
    "the values of @xmath53 obtained by the fit in each @xmath7 bin are displayed in fig  [ expox ] and clearly confirm the long time prediction made for asymptotic free field theories like qcd  @xcite of a rise of @xmath5 at low @xmath6 , and that the strength of this rise increases with @xmath7 . with the present data , it is however not possible to know precisely this strength below 5 gev@xmath2 , thereby postponing a definite test of perturbative qcd in this region .                          to make fully use of the new precision reached with the 1994 data , the h1 collaboration has performed a next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd fit on the h1 , bcdms and nmc data with the conditions @xmath54 5 gev@xmath2 , and @xmath55 0.5 if @xmath56 15 gev@xmath2 to avoid higher - twists effects .",
    "the h1 measurements which extend up to 5000 gev@xmath2 ( they are shown up to 120 gev@xmath2 in fig .",
    "[ f2x ] ) were fitted successfully and allow to constrain the gluon density at low @xmath6 .",
    "the parton densities were parametrized at @xmath57=5 gev@xmath2 , in particular the gluon was expressed with 3 parameters as @xmath58 .",
    "the quark and antiquark components of the sea were assumed to be equal , and @xmath59 set equal to @xmath60 . as determined in  @xcite ,",
    "the strange quark density was taken to be @xmath61 .",
    "further constraints were coming from the quark counting rules and the momentum sum rules .",
    "for @xmath62 the value of 263 mev was taken  @xcite .",
    "a detailed treatment of the @xmath5 errors propagation on the gluon density has been done , resulting in the error bands of fig  [ glugrv]b which represent @xmath63 at 5 and 20 gev@xmath2 .",
    "a variation of @xmath62 by 65 mev gives a change of 9% on the gluon density at 20 gev@xmath2 which has not been added to the error bands .",
    "the accuracy of this determination of @xmath64 is better by about a factor of two than the h1 result based on the 1993 data  @xcite .",
    "a rise of the gluon density towards low @xmath6 is observed which is related to the behaviour of @xmath65 .",
    "accordingly , the rise of @xmath64 towards low @xmath6 increases with increasing @xmath7 .",
    "finally we can observe in fig .",
    "[ f2x ] that the data at @xmath66  gev@xmath2 , which were excluded from the fit , are still well reproduced by the fit evolved backwards in @xmath7 .",
    "more data at low @xmath6 and @xmath67  gev@xmath2 are nevertheless needed to be able to test the hypothesis of a gluon density which would take the valence - like shape displayed in fig .",
    "[ glugrv]a when @xmath68 0.3 gev@xmath2 , and more generally , to better understand the dynamics at low @xmath7 and high parton densities .",
    "the hera experiments , which have last year upgraded the capabilities of their backward detectors , will be able to reach these low @xmath7 with the data taken in 1995 and 1996 .",
    "i would like to thank the organizers and in particular kim and j. trn thanh vn to have realized such an interesting and fruitful exchange workshop in this fascinating country .",
    "i would also like to thank my close collaborators , ursula bassler , beatriz gonzalez - pineiro and fabian zomer , all the friends of the h1 structure function group and the h1 and zeus collaboration with whom we obtained the results described above .",
