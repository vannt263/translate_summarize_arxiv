    "the study of interstellar clouds requires to model the emission of various molecular species , either neutrals , ions , or radicals .",
    "such studies can aim at determining the molecular abundances , which put constraints on our understanding of the molecular formation chemistry .",
    "additionally , various molecules can be used as probes of the physical conditions of the clouds ( temperature , density , kinematics ) , and thus shed some light on the dynamical evolution of the cores and their capability to form stars .",
    "no single species is observable from the surface of the clouds to their deeply buried , dense and cold cores . as an exemple , while hf traces the outskirts @xcite , co originates from the bulk of the envelope but starts to be depleted at densities typically above @xmath43 @xmath5  10@xmath6 @xmath7   ( @xcite ; see for a summary ) .",
    "dense cores , and especially prestellar cores ( density above 1@xmath5  10@xmath8 @xmath7 , @xcite ) , suffer from strong depletion of most tracers ( co , cs , so , etc .",
    ", e.g. , ) and it has been found that only a handful of species survive in the gas phase . among them , nitrogen  carrying molecules are the best known ( nh@xmath9 , n@xmath0h@xmath1 , and possibly cn , ) . in particular , they have the advantage to be generally confined to the cores . among these species",
    ", n@xmath0h@xmath1 is an interesting tool to investigate cold cores . in a first place , this is due to its high dipole moment ( @xmath10 debye , * ? ? ?",
    "hence , contrary to the 23 ghz inversion lines of nh@xmath9 , its @xmath11 line critical density is high ( @xmath12 1 @xmath5  10@xmath8 @xmath7 , about 2 orders of magnitude higher ) which makes this molecule a better tool than nh@xmath9 to evaluate the excitation conditions in prestellar cores .",
    "additionally , its hyperfine structure strongly helps to discriminate between opacity effects and excitation temperature effects which puts strong constraints in the determination of the physical conditions .",
    "finally , its deuterated isotopologue was also shown to be valuable in quantifying the chemical age of the cores . however , to fully use the capabilities of n@xmath0h@xmath1 as a tracer of the cloud conditions , collisional data with h@xmath0 are needed .",
    "the determination of collisional rate coefficients for n@xmath0h@xmath1(x@xmath2 ) with the most abundant interstellar species has been the subject of various dedicated studies in the past decades .",
    "the first realistic n@xmath0h@xmath1he rate coefficients have been provided almost forty years ago by @xcite .",
    "subsequently , @xcite have computed a new n@xmath0h@xmath1he potential energy surface ( pes ) from highly correlated @xmath13 @xmath14 calculations , and derived the corresponding rotational excitation rate coefficients . by comparison with the former calculations , it was found that the differences span the range from a few percent to 100% .",
    "the cross sections and rate coefficients between hyperfine levels were then obtained using a recoupling technique .",
    "however , in these two studies , the collisional partner was the he atom and recent results @xcite have pointed out that rate coefficients for collisions with h@xmath15(@xmath16 ) , the most abundant collisional partner in the ism , are generally different from those for collisions with he .",
    "this is even more true in the case of molecular ions .",
    "indeed , the difference of polarisabilities between h@xmath0 and he has consequences in the long  range expansions of the corresponding pess , which results in very different collisional data . taking into account the importance of having accurate rate coefficients for the n@xmath0h@xmath1h@xmath15 collisional system , we have decided to compute the first n@xmath0h@xmath1h@xmath15 collisional data .",
    "such calculations are very challenging from a chemical physics point of view . indeed , even if endothermic and inefficient at typical interstellar temperature , the n@xmath0h@xmath1h@xmath15 system is a reactive system .",
    "the computation of a pes for the n@xmath0h@xmath1h@xmath15 complex is then a difficult task that has been recently overcome by spielfiedel et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "the endothermicity of the n@xmath0h@xmath1 + h@xmath0 @xmath17 n@xmath0 + h@xmath18 reaction being greater than 5000 @xmath19 , purely inelastic calculations can be safely performed for collisional energies below 500 @xmath19 .",
    "hence , using this new accurate pes , we have computed state  to  state rate coefficients between the first n@xmath0h@xmath1 hyperfine levels and for temperatures ranging from 5  k to 70  k.    the paper is organized as follows : section 2 describes the _ ab initio _ calculation of the pes and provides a brief description of both theory and calculations . in sect .",
    "3 we present and discuss our results .",
    "section 4 is devoted to first astrophysical applications and the conclusions of this work are drawn in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "in our scattering calculations , we employed the recently computed n@xmath0h@xmath1h@xmath0 pes of spielfiedel et al .",
    "( in preparation ) . in what follows , we briefly remind the features of the n@xmath0h@xmath1h@xmath0 pes and we refer the reader to spielfiedel et al .",
    "( in preparation ) for more details .",
    "the @xmath13 @xmath14 calculations were performed using the jacobi coordinate system . in such a system ,",
    "the vector @xmath20 connects the n@xmath0h@xmath1 and h@xmath0 mass centres .",
    "the rotation of the n@xmath0h@xmath1 and h@xmath0 molecules is defined by the @xmath21 and @xmath22 angles , respectively , and @xmath23 is the dihedral angle .",
    "the four dimension ( 4d ) n@xmath0h@xmath1h@xmath0 pes was calculated in the supermolecular approach , based on the single and double excitation coupled cluster method ( ccsd ) @xcite , with perturbative contributions of connected triple excitations computed as defined by @xcite [ ccsd(t ) ] .",
    "the calculations were performed using the augmented correlation - consistent triple zeta ( aug - cc - pvtz ) basis set @xcite .",
    "both molecules were treated as rigid rotors and we fixed the internuclear distances of h@xmath15 and n@xmath0h@xmath1 at their averaged and experimental equilibrium values , respectively : r@xmath24 = 1.448 a@xmath25 for h@xmath15 and r@xmath26 = 2.065 a@xmath25 and r@xmath27 = 1.955 a@xmath25 for n@xmath0h@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "an analytical representation of the pes , noted @xmath28 , was obtained by expanding the interaction energies over angular functions , for distances along the @xmath29 coordinate , using the following expression @xcite : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is formed from coupled spherical functions associated with the rotational angular momenta of n@xmath0h@xmath1 and h@xmath15 ( see spielfiedel et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the equilibrium structure was found for a t - shape configuration with the h atom of n@xmath0h@xmath1 pointing towards the centre of mass of h@xmath15 .",
    "the corresponding distance between the centres of mass is 5.8 a@xmath25 and the well depth is -2530.86 @xmath19 .",
    "taking into account the large well depth of the pes and the relatively small rotational constant of the n@xmath0h@xmath1 molecule , we could anticipate that scattering calculations that would consider the rotational structure of both molecules would be prohibitive in terms of memory and cpu time .",
    "then , in order to simplify the calculations , we reduced the 4d pes to a 2d pes ( see spielfiedel et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , using an adiabatic approximation @xcite . in such pes , the rotation of the h@xmath0 molecule is neglected .",
    "the resulting pes was fitted by means of the procedure described by @xcite for the cn  he system .",
    "note that the 2d pes is specifically tailored for the rotational excitation of n@xmath0h@xmath1 by h@xmath32 and can not be used to simulate h@xmath33 collisions .    despite of this approximation",
    ", the accuracy of the scattering calculations is expected to be relatively good , as already demonstrated by @xcite in the case of h@xmath0o ",
    "h@xmath0 collisions . to ascertain the error introduced by the use of",
    "the 2d adiabatically reduced dimensional pes , we compare , in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , two partial cross sections obtained at a fixed total angular momentum @xmath34 .",
    "the first cross section is based on the full 4d pes and includes the coupling with the @xmath35 and 6 levels of h@xmath15 , which are needed to fully converge the cross sections .",
    "the second cross sections are obtained from the 2d adiabatically reduced dimensional pes and in this case , the calculations were performed just including the @xmath16 state of h@xmath0 . in both cases",

    "the main differences are the presence of resonances in the calculations based on the 4d pes , that are not present or well reproduced when using the 2d pes .",
    "however , resonances have been shown to influence only moderately the magnitude of the rate coefficients and consequently , we believe that an accurate description of the scattering of n@xmath0h@xmath1 with para  h@xmath15 can be obtained by the simplified treatment described above .      the main goal of this work is to determine hyperfine resolved integral cross sections and rate coefficients of @xmath37n@xmath37nh@xmath1 molecules induced by collisions with h@xmath32 . since the rotational structure of h@xmath0 is neglected , the problem , in terms of scattering calculations , is equivalent to the collisional excitation of n@xmath0h@xmath1 by a structureless atom .    since the nitrogen atoms possess a non - zero nuclear spin ( @xmath38 ) , the n@xmath0h@xmath1 rotational energy levels are split in hyperfine levels which are characterized by the quantum numbers @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 . here , @xmath40 results from the coupling of @xmath42 with @xmath43 ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 being the nuclear spin of the first nitrogen atom ) and @xmath41 results from the coupling of @xmath46 with @xmath47 ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 being the nuclear spin of the second nitrogen atom )",
    "however , the hyperfine splitting of the n@xmath0h@xmath1 levels is very small . hence , by assuming that the hyperfine levels are degenerate , it is possible to considerably simplify the hyperfine scattering problem .",
    "then , the integral cross sections corresponding to transitions between hyperfine levels of the n@xmath0h@xmath1 molecule can be obtained from scattering nuclear spin free s - matrices using a recoupling method @xcite .",
    "we used @xcite description of the inelastic scattering between an atom and a linear molecule in order to obtain the close - coupling ( cc ) scattering matrix @xmath50 , between rotational levels of n@xmath0h@xmath1 .",
    "we emphasize that in the calculation of the @xmath50 elements , the n@xmath0h@xmath1 hyperfine structure is not taken into account .",
    "inelastic cross sections between the hyperfine levels , from level @xmath51 to level @xmath52 , are subsequently obtained through @xcite :    @xmath53    the @xmath54 are the opacity tensors defined by : @xmath55 the reduced t - matrix elements ( where @xmath56 ) are defined by @xcite : @xmath57      the nuclear  spin ",
    "free @xmath50 matrix elements were calculated using the molscat program  @xcite .",
    "all calculations were made using the rigid rotor approximation .",
    "the @xmath37n@xmath37nh@xmath1 energy levels were computed using the rotational constants of @xcite .",
    "calculations were carried out for total energies up to 500  @xmath19 .",
    "parameters of the integrator were tested and adjusted to ensure a typical precision to within 0.05 @xmath58 for the inelastic cross sections and to within 1 @xmath58 for the elastic cross sections .",
    "for example , at total energies of 100 and 500 @xmath19 , total angular momentum @xmath59 up to 68 and 94 were taken into account in the scattering calculations , respectively . at each energy ,",
    "channels with @xmath39 up to 28 were included in the rotational basis to converge the calculations for all the transitions including n@xmath0h@xmath1 levels up to @xmath60 .",
    "using the recoupling technique and the stored @xmath50 matrix elements , the opacity tensors ( eq . [ tens ] ) and the hyperfine  state  resolved cross sections ( eq . [ xsc ] ) were obtained for all hyperfine levels up to @xmath61 .    from the calculated cross sections ,",
    "one can obtain the corresponding thermal rate coefficients at temperature @xmath62 by an average over the collision energy ( @xmath63 ) :    @xmath64    where @xmath65 is the cross section from initial level @xmath66 to final level @xmath67 , @xmath68 is the reduced mass of the system and @xmath69 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "using the computational scheme described above , we have obtained inelastic cross sections for transitions between the first 64 hyperfine levels of n@xmath0h@xmath1 . with calculations performed up to a total energy of 500 @xmath19 , we can determine the corresponding rate coefficients for temperatures up to 70 k. the complete set of ( de-)excitation rate coefficients with @xmath70 will be made available through the lamda @xcite and basecol @xcite databases .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] presents the temperature variation of the n@xmath0h@xmath1h@xmath3 rate coefficients for selected @xmath71 and @xmath72 transitions .",
    "h@xmath1h@xmath0(j=0 ) rate coefficients for @xmath73 and @xmath74 transitions.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] h@xmath1h@xmath0(j=0 ) rate coefficients for @xmath73 and @xmath74 transitions.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    first , one can note that the rate coefficients are weakly dependent of the temperature .",
    "this weak temperature dependance of the rate coefficients could have been anticipated , on the basis of langevin theory for ion - neutral interactions .",
    "one can also note the relatively large magnitude of the rate coefficients ( @xmath75 @xmath76 mol@xmath77 s@xmath77 for the dominant transitions ) .",
    "usually , rate coefficients for neutral molecules such as for the isoeletronic co molecule are of the order of magnitude of @xmath78 @xmath76 mol@xmath77 s@xmath77 .",
    "the high magnitude of the rate coefficients can be related to the large well depth of the pes .",
    "this well depth is almost an order of magnitude larger than in the case of neutral molecules interacting with h@xmath0 .",
    "such effect has been already observed for the hco@xmath1 cation @xcite or for the the cn@xmath79 anion @xcite but is absent when using he as a model for h@xmath0 .",
    "hence , considering specifically h@xmath0 will be of crucial importance for interstellar ions by comparison to neutral species .    in the current case , the determination of the hyperfine propensity rules is more complex than for the case of only one nuclear spin , where the usual @xmath80 propensity is observed @xcite .",
    "in fact , as explained in @xcite , because of the behaviour of the wigner6j coefficients in eq . [ xsc ] , we expect that the largest rate coefficients will satisfy ( i ) if @xmath81 then @xmath82 , ( ii ) if @xmath83 then @xmath84 .",
    "such propensity rules were indeed found to describe , on the average , the two nuclear spins case and for the of n@xmath0h@xmath1he system @xcite .",
    "however , the only well defined propensity rule is @xmath85 confirming that hyperfine rate coefficients can not be accurately estimated from fine structure rate coefficients using for example the @xmath86 randomizing limit @xcite approach .",
    "finally , figure [ fig3 ] presents the temperature variation in n@xmath0h@xmath1h@xmath3 rate coefficients for the  quasi - elastic \" @xmath87 transitions .",
    "h@xmath1h@xmath3 rate coefficients for @xmath87 transitions.,width=302 ]    one can notice that the order of magnitude of these  quasi - elastic \" rate coefficients is similar to the pure inelastic rate coefficients .",
    "additionally , for transitions inside a rotational level @xmath39 , it is difficult to extract a clear propensity rule .",
    "it is interesting to compare the present rate coefficients with those calculated for n@xmath0h@xmath1he collisions @xcite .",
    "indeed , collisions with he are often used to model collisions with para - h@xmath32 and it is generally assumed that rate coefficients with para - h@xmath32 should be larger than he rate coefficients , owing to the smaller collisional reduced mass , and that the scaling factor should be @xmath41.4 @xcite .",
    "we have compared in table [ table : rates ] , on a small sample , the n@xmath0h@xmath1h@xmath32 and n@xmath0h@xmath1he rate coefficients at 10 , 30 and 50 k.    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     as one can see , significant differences exist between the present and the previous results .",
    "the present data differ by up to a factor of @xmath4 3 from the previous results , the new results being systematically larger than the previous ones .",
    "hence , the scaling factor is clearly different from 1.4 and the ratio varies with both the temperature and the transition considered .",
    "low collisional energies cross sections are very sensitive to the shape and depth of the pes well .",
    "it is then not surprising to see significant differences between the two collisional systems at low temperature .",
    "it could have been anticipated that scattering studies involving he as the perturber and as a representative of molecular h@xmath0 are questionable in the case of molecular ions .",
    "as previously discussed , this is a consequence of the difference of polarizabilities with either h@xmath0 or he .",
    "as stated in sect . [ comparaison_he ] , the current h@xmath0 rate coefficients differ significantly from the previously available rate coefficients from @xcite , that considered he as a collisional partner .",
    "since these rate coefficients were the only available data until now , they were used in many astrophysical studies .",
    "most of the time , a scaling factor of 1.4 was used to emulate the h@xmath0 rate coefficients . as discussed in the previous section",
    ", this factor leads to an underestimate of the actual values of the h@xmath0 rate coefficients .",
    "more recently , @xcite used a scaling relationship based on the hco@xmath1h@xmath0 and hco@xmath1he rate coefficients .",
    "the correction applied thus ranged from factors of 1.4 and 3.2 depending on the transition considered , with a ratio of @xmath42.3 applied to the transitions with @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "given the current results , this scaling procedure gives a better estimate of the h@xmath0 rate coefficients than simply assuming a constant 1.4 value .    in order to highlight the impact of the new rate coefficients on the interpretation of the n@xmath0h@xmath1 observations",
    ", we performed a few radiative transfer calculations for physical parameters ( i.e. gas density , temperature , ... ) and n@xmath0h@xmath1 abundances typical of dark clouds conditions .",
    "these calculations are based on the numerical code described in @xcite : the radiative transfer is solved exactly and includes the line overlap between the hyperfine transitions .",
    "additionally , the n@xmath0h@xmath1 energy structure and line frequencies are obtained from the spectroscopical constants of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the line strengths and einstein coefficients are obtained from the cdms database @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we compare the line intensities , integrated over frequency , for the @xmath90 and @xmath91 lines , and for radiative transfer calculations based either on the he or h@xmath0 rate coefficients . for the purpose of the comparison , we made the choice to use the antenna temperature scale , noted @xmath92 . in the figure",
    ", we give the ratio of the results based on the h@xmath0 rate coefficients over the results obtained with the he ones , scaled by a factor 1.4 . in order to perform the calculations",
    ", we assumed a static and homogeneous spherical cloud of diameter 3 at a distance of 100 pc .",
    "we fixed the gas temperature at @xmath93 k and then varied the h@xmath0 density in the range @xmath94 @xmath95(h@xmath0 ) @xmath96 @xmath7 , and the n@xmath0h@xmath1 abundance in the range @xmath97 @xmath98(n@xmath0h@xmath1 ) @xmath99 .        from this figure",
    ", it appears that between the two sets of rate coefficients , the line intensities can show variations as large as a factor @xmath42 . as discussed in sect .",
    "[ comparaison_he ] , this factor is similar to the difference that is obtained on average between the two sets of rate coefficients .",
    "note that the differences are the largest at low n@xmath0h@xmath1 column densities ( i.e. low @xmath95(h@xmath0 ) and/or @xmath98(n@xmath0h@xmath1 ) ) , since for the highest values , both the @xmath90 and @xmath91 lines tend to thermalize .",
    "as an example , considering the @xmath90 line , we see in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] that the integrated intensity ratio is @xmath41 for densities @xmath95(h@xmath0 ) @xmath12 @xmath100 @xmath7 .",
    "finally , it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] that there is a differential effect introduced by the rate coefficients on the @xmath90 and @xmath91 line intensities . indeed , over the conditions spanned by the current grid of models",
    ", we can see that the effect is systematically larger for the @xmath101 line by comparison to the @xmath90 line . in practice",
    ", this differential effect implies that in any astrophysical application , switching from the he rate coefficients to the h@xmath0 rate coefficients will require to modify the estimate of both the h@xmath0 density and the n@xmath0h@xmath1 abundance , and not solely one of these parameters . in order to emphasize this point , we considered the @xmath90 and @xmath91 line intensities obtained with the h@xmath0 rate coefficients and for the parameters @xmath95(h@xmath0 ) = 2@xmath510@xmath102 @xmath7 and @xmath98(n@xmath0h@xmath1 ) = 1 @xmath5  10@xmath103 .",
    "subsequently , by using the he rate coefficients , we determined the value of @xmath95(h@xmath0 ) and @xmath98(n@xmath0h@xmath1 ) which enable to obtain similar line intensities for these two radiative transitions .",
    "the value of the h@xmath0 density and n@xmath0h@xmath1 abundance are determined by minimizing the quantity : @xmath104 where @xmath105 and @xmath106 stands for the integrated intensities obtained respectively with the h@xmath0 and scaled he rate coefficients . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , the value of the distance @xmath107 is reported as a function of @xmath95(h@xmath0 ) and @xmath98(n@xmath0h@xmath1 ) .",
    "it appears that the @xmath90 and @xmath91 line intensities obtained with the h@xmath0 rate coefficients can be reproduced with the he rate coefficients by varying both @xmath95(h@xmath0 ) and @xmath98(n@xmath0h@xmath1 ) by factors of 2 .",

    "hence , using the he rate coefficients will induce an overestimation of the h@xmath0 density and an underestimation of the n@xmath0h@xmath1 abundance .",
    "given the variations in magnitude of the rate coefficients between the two sets of rate coefficients , we can expect that a factor @xmath42 will be typical of the modifications induced by the new set of rates on @xmath95(h@xmath0 ) and @xmath98(n@xmath0h@xmath1 ) .",
    "since kinetic temperature has also an impact on the excitation conditions but has to be kept realistic , we revisited a well - known and modelled case , ldn 183 , which was previously analysed with the hyperfine collisional rates computed with he .",
    "the goal is to estimate the magnitude of the changes in a real case .",
    "we did not attempt to recompute the best possible fit to the data but only a plausible fit by eye to gauge the magnitude of the changes . with the former core properties as listed in , table 2 ( best model ) , all the modelled lines are stronger than observed with the new collision rates , as expected from the model runs described above .",
    "we tried to vary separately the kinetic temperature , the density profile and the n@xmath0h@xmath1 abundance and found no convincing solution , again confirming the results discussed above . a workable solution consisted in lowering the temperature in the core , replacing the 7k constant value by a gradient from 6 to 7k , lowering the density by 20% in the layers at temperature at 6.5k or above and increasing the n@xmath0h@xmath1 abundance by a factor 2 in the central two layers .",
    "globally , the n@xmath0h@xmath1 column density decreases by a factor 8% ( inner core ) to 20% for the outer core . the n@xmath0h@xmath1 @xmath90 line being quite optically thick in ldn 183 ( 6 out of the 7 distinguishable hyperfine components have identical intensity towards the central position , instead of the 3:5:7 ratio observed in optically thin cases ) , the sensitivity of the results to the new collisional coefficients is not as dramatic as one can expect in an optically thin case but the model is more accurate and the temperature is a new low record ( a temperature of 5.5 k has been advocated in the case of ldn 1544 from nh@xmath9 interferometric observations , @xcite ) .",
    "this temperature variation impacts also the dust temperature estimate ( dust and gas are thermally coupled at n(h@xmath0 ) = 1 @xmath5  10@xmath110 @xmath7 ) and consequently the dust properties .",
    "and he rate coefficients .",

    "<S> the modelling of emission spectra of molecules seen in interstellar clouds requires the knowledge of collisional rate coefficients . among the commonly observed species , n@xmath0h@xmath1 is of particular interest since it was shown to be a good probe of the physical conditions of cold molecular clouds . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we have calculated hyperfine  structure resolved excitation rate coefficients of n@xmath0h@xmath1(x@xmath2 ) by h@xmath3 , the most abundant collisional partner in the cold interstellar medium . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations are based on a new potential energy surface , obtained from highly correlated _ ab initio _ calculations . </S>",
    "<S> state - to - state rate coefficients between the first hyperfine levels were calculated , for temperatures ranging from 5  k to 70  k. by comparison with previously published n@xmath0h@xmath1he rate coefficients , we found significant differences which can not be reproduced by a simple scaling relationship . </S>",
    "<S> as a first application , we also performed radiative transfer calculations , for physical conditions typical of cold molecular clouds . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the simulated line intensities significantly increase when using the new h@xmath0 rate coefficients , by comparison with the predictions based on the he rate coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we revisited the modelling of the n@xmath0h@xmath1 emission in the ldn 183 core , using the new collisional data , and found that all three of the density , gas kinetic temperature and n@xmath0h@xmath1 abundance had to be revised .    </S>",
