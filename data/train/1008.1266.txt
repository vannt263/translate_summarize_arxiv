    "while the anderson model is by far the most studied model of a random schrdinger operator and still poses open problems , recent years have seen an increased interest in other types of random operators such as the poisson model , the random displacement model , or schrdinger operators involving random magnetic fields .",
    "some recent references are @xcite .",
    "while there are good physical reasons to look at these models , an equally strong mathematical motivation for their investigation stems from challenges arising due to the lack of monotonicity properties in these models .",
    "such properties have been heavily used in the theory of anderson - type models . however , even in the anderson model , non - monotonicity issues arise if one considers single - site terms which are not sign - definite , see , e.g. @xcite .",
    "absence of monotonicity requires new ideas , which , besides posing a mathematical challenge , often require a better understanding of physical mechanisms , typically in the form of a more subtle interplay between kinetic and potential energy . in particular , this has become apparent in the recent works @xcite on the continuum random displacement model ( rdm ) , a random schrdinger operator of the form @xmath3 in @xmath4 with single - site terms @xmath5 displaced randomly by vectors @xmath6 from the sites @xmath7 of the lattice @xmath1 .",
    "it was found that the lack of monotonicity can be widely remedied by symmetry considerations as long as one assumes corresponding symmetry properties of the single - site potential .",
    "this has led to key insights for the rdm , such as a characterization of the spectral minimum , properties of the integrated density of states and a wegner estimate at low energy , ultimately leading to a proof of localization near the bottom of the spectrum for the continuum rdm in @xcite .",
    "our main goal here is to provide analogues of the results in @xcite and @xcite for a _ discrete _ version of the rdm . while we largely succeed in this attempt , in some instances we fall short of carrying over results from the continuum , which is mostly due to a well known problem for lattice operators , the lack of unique continuation properties which are frequently used in @xcite . in particular , this is the reason why a proof of localization for models like the one considered here , just as for the discrete anderson model with singularly distributed coupling constants , is still out of reach , see the remarks in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "however , this shortcoming does not affect the 1d case , where we recover all the results from the continuum .",
    "in fact , for @xmath8 we find new phenomena , not encountered in the continuum .",
    "in particular , for a one - dimensional rdm with bernoulli distributed random displacements we find a gap in the almost sure spectrum and , in the case of symmetric distribution , are able to investigate the behavior of the integrated density of states ( ids ) at the spectral minimum and maximum as well as at the edges of this gap . at all these edges the ids has a @xmath2-singularity and , in particular , is not hlder continuous .",
    "we mention that localization at all energies for the one - dimensional discrete rdm has been proven in @xcite , where the more general setting of _ random word models _ was considered .",
    "this is based on showing that the lyapunov exponent is positive at all but an at most finite set of critical energies , which may give rise to quantum transport for wave packets with energy support close to the critical energies , while it does not inhibit spectral localization and also leads to dynamical localization away from the critical energies .",
    "the remaining sections of this paper are structured as follows : in section  [ sec : modelresults ] we introduce the discrete displacement model and state all our results .",
    "here we also formulate a discrete version of the fact that `` bubbles tend to the corners '' , a result originally proven in @xcite for the continuum rdm which provides a central tool for our work .",
    "sections  [ sec : multidresults ] , [ sec : nonunique ] and [ sec : bernoulli ] contain all proofs , with section  [ sec : multidresults ] giving results which hold in arbitrary dimension and sections  [ sec : nonunique ] and [ sec : bernoulli ] presenting proofs of results for the one - dimensional model . in particular , we discuss the one - dimensional bernoulli rdm in section  [ sec : bernoulli ] .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusion ] contains concluding remarks including several open conjectures , partly based on numerical observations presented there .",
    "we will construct a random potential on @xmath1 , @xmath9 , by randomly placing single - site terms supported in a rectangular box into translates of a larger box .",
    "the two basic boxes are @xmath10\\subset \\mathbb{z}^d \\qquad \\textrm{and } \\qquad b:=\\prod_{i=1}^d[1,b_i ] \\subset \\mathbb{z}^d\\ ] ] where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are fixed for each @xmath13 .",
