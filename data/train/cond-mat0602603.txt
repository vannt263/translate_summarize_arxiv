    "a large variety of natural systems exhibit irregular and complex behavior which at first looks erratic , but in fact possesses scale invariant structure ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a process @xmath9 is called self - similar@xcite if for some @xmath10 , @xmath11 where the symbol of equality refers here to all finite - dimensional distributions of the process on the left and the right , and the parameter @xmath12 is called self - similarity index or exponent . equation ( [ eq1 ] )",
    "means a `` scale invariance '' of the finite - dimensional distributions of @xmath13 , which does _ not _ imply , in stochastic processes , the same for the sample paths ( e.g.,@xcite ) .",
    "examples of self - similar processes are brownian , fractional brownian ( fbm ) , lvy stable and fractional lvy stable motion ( flsm ) .",
    "lvy stable distributions ( which are followed by many natural processes , e.g. , @xcite ) differ greatly from the gaussian ones because they have heavy tails and their variance is infinite ( e.g.,@xcite ) .",
    "an important point in analyzing data from natural systems that exhibit scale invariant structure , is the following : in several systems this nontrivial structure points to long - range _ temporal _ correlations ; in other words , the self - similarity results from the process memory only ( e.g. , the case of fbm ) .",
    "alternatively , the self - similarity may solely result from the process increments infinite variance , e.g. , lvy stable motion .",
    "( note , that in distributions that are applicable to a large variety of problems , extreme events have to be _ truncated _ for physical reasons , e.g. , finite size effects , -when there is no infinity@xcite- and this is why we write hereafter `` infinite '' . ) in general , however , the self - similarity may result from both these origins ( e.g. , flsm ) .",
    "it is the main aim of this paper to discuss how a distinction of the two origins of self - similarity ( i.e. , process memory , process increments `` infinite '' variance ) can be in principle achieved by employing the natural time analysis .    in a time series comprising @xmath14 events , the _ natural time _",

    "the evolution of the pair ( @xmath17 ) is considered@xcite , where @xmath18 denotes in general a quantity proportional to the energy released in the @xmath16-th event .",
    "for example , for dichotomous signals @xmath18 stands for the duration of the @xmath16-th pulse while for the seismicity @xmath18 is proportional to the seismic energy released during the @xmath16-th earthquake@xcite ( which is proportional to the seismic moment @xmath19 ) .",

    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we treat the case when the self - similarity solely results from the process memory . section iii deals with the self - similarity resulting from the process increments infinite variance by restricting ourselves to slowly driven systems that emit energy bursts obeying power law distributions .",
    "a brief discussion follows in section iv , while section v presents the main conclusion .",
    "we consider , as an example , seismic electric signals ( ses ) activities which exhibit infinitely ranged temporal correlations@xcite .",
    "figure [ fg1](a ) shows a recent ses activity recorded at a station located in central greece ( close to patras city , pat ) on february 13 , 2006 .",
    "it comprises 37 pulses , the durations @xmath18 of which vary between 1s and 40s ( see fig .",
    "[ fg1](b ) ) . the natural time representation of this ses activity can be seen in fig.[fg1](b ) and the computation of @xmath4 , @xmath35 and @xmath42 leads to the following values : @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "these values obey the conditions @xmath46 and @xmath47 that have already been found@xcite to be obeyed for other ses activities .",
    "if we repeat the computation for surrogate data obtained by _ shuffling _",
    "the durations @xmath48 randomly ( and hence their distribution is conserved ) , the corresponding quantities , designated by adding a subscript `` shuf '' , have the following values : @xmath49 and @xmath50 with standard deviations 0.008 and 0.011 respectively .",
    "they are almost equal to the corresponding values of a `` uniform '' distribution , i.e. , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , although the experimental error in this case is large due to the small number of pulses . by applying the same procedure to other ses activities reported earlier@xcite , we find ( see table [ tab0 ] ) that actually @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "this points to the conclusion that the self - similarity of ses activity results from the process memory only , which agrees with an independent analysis of ref.@xcite .",
    "( a)an ses activity recently recorded at pat station(sampling rate @xmath55hz ) . the actual electric field * e * is 6 mv / km , but here the signal is presented in normalized units , i.e. , by subtracting the mean value @xmath56 and dividing by the standard deviation @xmath57 .",

    "the values of @xmath58 as a function of @xmath59 for the case of the fbm simulations of ref.@xcite(crosses , lower scale ) or as a function of @xmath3 for power law distributed data ( asterisks , upper scale ) . they have been estimated by following the procedure described in the appendix b of ref.@xcite .",
    "the corresponding lines have been drawn as a guide to the eye . ]",
    "( color online ) the probability density function @xmath6 versus @xmath4 for several values of @xmath3 ( see the text and @xcite ) . ]",
    "( color online)the pdfs of @xmath4 when using either the actual seismic catalogue of japan(solid ) treated in ref.@xcite or the same data in random order ( dashed ) . ]",

    "interestingly , the values of the quantities @xmath63 and @xmath59 are consistent with the results deduced from a numerical simulation in fbm time series described in ref.@xcite ; the latter showed that when @xmath62 the corresponding values are : @xmath46 , @xmath64 .",
    "figure [ fg2 ] depicts the most probable value @xmath58 of @xmath4 versus @xmath59 resulting from such a numerical simulation .",
    "we now study a case of self - similarity resulting from the process increments `` infinite '' variance . here , we restrict ourselves to slowly driven systems that emit energy bursts obeying power law distribution @xmath65 where @xmath3 is constant . in a large variety of such systems , in diverse fields , an inspection of the recent experimental data reveals that the @xmath3 exponent lies in a narrow range , i.e. , @xmath66 ( and mostly even within narrower bounds , i.e. , @xmath67 1.5 to 1.8 ) . to realize the diversity of the phenomena that exhibit the aforementioned property",
    ", we compile some indicative examples in table [ tab1 ] , which are the following .",
    "first , crystalline materials subjected to an external stress , display bursts of activity owing the nucleation and motion of dislocations .",
    "these sudden local changes produce acoustic emission waves which reveal that a large number of dislocations move cooperatively in an intermittent fashion ( e.g. , see @xcite and references therein ) . as a precise example , we include in table [ tab1 ] the results of acoustic emission experiments on stressed single crystals of ice under viscoelastic deformation ( creep ) , which show that the probability distribution of energy bursts intensities obey a power - law distribution with @xmath67 1.6 spanning many decades ( see fig.[fg1 ] of @xcite ) .",
    "second , we consider the case of solar flares that represent impulsive energy releases in the solar corona ( e.g. see ref . @xcite and references therein ; see also ref.@xcite in which it is concluded that earthquakes and solar flares exhibit the same distributions of sizes , interoccurrence times , and the same temporal clustering ) .",
    "this energy release is observed in various forms : thermal , soft and hard x - ray emissions , accelerated particles etc .",
    "the statistical analysis of these impulsive events show that the energy distribution exhibit , over several orders of magnitude , a power - law with exponents @xmath3 ranging from 1.5 to approximately 2.1 ( depending on the experimental procedure and the geometrical assumptions adopted in the analysis ) .",
    "other examples are : acoustic emission from microfractures before the breakup of heterogeneous materials ( wood , fiberglass ) , icequakes and earthquakes .",
    "concerning the latter , the best known scaling relation is the gutenberg - richter law@xcite , which states that the ( cumulative ) number of earthquakes with magnitude greater than m occurring in a specified area and time is given by @xmath68 where @xmath8 is a constant , which varies only slightly from region to region ( cf .",
    "eq.([eq10 ] ) holds both _ regionally _ and _ globally _ ) being generally in the range @xmath69 ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "considering that the seismic energy @xmath1 released during an earthquake is related@xcite to the magnitude through @xmath70 -where @xmath71 is around 1.5- eq.([eq10 ] ) turns to eq.([eq9 ] ) , where @xmath72 .",
    "hence , @xmath73 means that the exponent @xmath3 is around @xmath3=1.6 to 1.7 .",
    "the following procedure is now applied : we generate(see also@xcite ) a large amount of artificial data obeying eq.([eq10 ] ) for a certain @xmath3 value .",
    "these _ randomized _ ( `` shuffled''@xcite ) data are subsequently analyzed , in the natural time domain , for each @xmath3 value , with the following procedure@xcite : first , calculation of the variance @xmath4 is made for an event taking time windows for 6 to 40 consecutive events ( the choice of the precise value of the upper limit is not found decisive , because practically the same results are obtained even if the number of consecutive events was changed from 6 - 40 to 6 - 100 , as it will be further discussed below ) . and second , this process was performed for all the events by scanning the whole dataset . in fig.[fg3 ] we plot the quantity @xmath6 versus @xmath4 for several @xmath3-values .",
    "the most probable value @xmath58 ( for @xmath3 = constant ) is also plotted in fig.[fg2 ] versus the corresponding @xmath3-value .",
    "this curve interrelates @xmath4 and @xmath3 for the shuffled data ( thus an eventual process memory is here destroyed@xcite ) and hence the plotted @xmath58 values ( which differ markedly from @xmath74 ) correspond to the self - similarity resulting from the heavy - tailed distribution only .    in order to identify the origin of self - similarity in a real data set , let us consider here the example of earthquakes . using the japan catalogue mentioned in ref.@xcite , we give in fig.4 the two curves @xmath6 versus @xmath4 that result when the aforementioned calculation is made by means of a window of 6 - 40 concecutive events sliding through either the original catalogue or a shuffled one . comparing the resulting @xmath58 values ( both of which markedly differ from @xmath74 )",
    "we see that the value of the surrogate data ( @xmath75 ) differs slightly from the one ( @xmath76 ) corresponding to the original data .",
    "this reflects that the self - similarity mainly originates from the process increments `` infinite '' variance .",
    "note , however , that the @xmath58 value of the original data is comparable to the value @xmath4=0.070 that was found in infinitely ranged _ temporal _ correlations . this merits further investigation .",
    "here , we discuss a challenging point that emerges from a further elaboration of the results depicted in fig.3 . first , note that upon increasing the @xmath3 value from @xmath3 = 1.3 to 2.0 , the feature of the curve changes significantly , becoming bimodal at intermediate @xmath3-values .",
    "second , we calculate , for each @xmath3-value studied , the so called _ differential entropy _ , defined as @xmath77 which is the shannon information entropy of a continuous probability distribution , e.g. , see @xcite .",
    "( note that , the shannon information entropy is _",
    "static _ entropy and _ not _ a dynamic one @xcite . )",
    "finally , we investigate the resulting @xmath60-values versus @xmath3 .",
    "such a plot is given in fig.5 , whose inspection reveals that @xmath60 maximizes at a value of @xmath3 lying between @xmath3 = 1.6 and @xmath3=1.7 , which is more or less comparable with the experimental values , see table [ tab1 ] .",
    "( this value is not practically affected by the window length ( @xmath78 ) chosen ; in reality , upon increasing @xmath78 from @xmath78=10 to @xmath78=1000 , we find that , @xmath3-value at which @xmath60 maximizes in fig.[fg2 ] , decreases only slightly from @xmath3=1.70 to @xmath3=1.63 . ) in particular for the case of earthquakes this @xmath3-value corresponds to @xmath73 , thus agreeing with the experimental findings mentioned above .",
    "does it mean that the @xmath8 or @xmath3 value can be determined just by applying the maximum entropy principle in the sense developed by jaynes@xcite , who suggested to look statistical mechanics as a form of _ statistical inference _ and _ start _ statistical physics from the principle of maximum entropy inference ( maxent ) ?",
    "this is not yet clear , because a widely accepted formalism for _ non - equilibrium _ statistical mechanics is still lacking .    finally",
    ", the fact that in some experiments the resulting @xmath3-values differ slightly from @xmath3=1.6 to 1.7 predicted from fig.[fg5 ] could be attributed to the following : figure [ fg5 ] is based on randomized data , while the actual data may also exhibit temporal correlations ( e.g. , the case of aftershocks ) .",
    "in addition , finite size effects@xcite might play a significant role .",
    "in summary , the origin of self - similarity may be distinguished as follows : if self - similarity exclusively results from the process memory , the @xmath4 value should _ change _ to @xmath74=0.0833 ( and the values of @xmath79 to @xmath80=0.0966 ) for the surrogate data . on the other hand ,",
    "if the self - similarity results from process increments `` infinite '' variance only , the @xmath58 values should be the same ( but differing from @xmath74 ) for the original and surrogate data .",
    "when studying the differential entropy associated with the pdf of @xmath4 it maximizes when the exponent @xmath3 lies in the narrow range 1.6 to 1.7 , in agreement with the experimental findings in diverse fields .",
    "this , for the case of earthquakes , immediately reflects that the @xmath8-value in the gutenberg - richter law is @xmath73 , as actually observed ."
