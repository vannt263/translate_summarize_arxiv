    "ngc 2516 is a well - studied nearby intermediate - age open cluster ( @xmath16 ; @xcite ) , at a distance modulus @xmath17 @xcite .",

    "we have adopted the smaller distance modulus of @xmath21 and photometric metallicity for the remainder of this work , but any differences induced in the results by the uncertainty in distance modulus are nevertheless small .",
    "ngc 2516 has often been referred to as the ` southern pleiades ' owing to its similarity both in angular extent and age , where we adopt an age of @xmath22 @xcite for the pleiades , using the classical main sequence turnoff ages throughout this work for consistency with the estimate for ngc 2516 .",
    "the pleiades metallicity is very similar , at @xmath19 } = -0.034 \\pm 0.024 $ ] @xcite .",
    "clusters in the age range between @xmath23 persei ( @xmath24 , e.g. @xcite ) and the hyades ( @xmath25 , @xcite ) are important for constraining stellar evolution models .",
    "figure [ zamstime ] shows a plot of the age at which a solar metallicity star reaches the zero age main sequence ( zams ) as a function of stellar mass , indicating that solar mass stars reach the zams at @xmath26 , and @xmath27 stars reach the zams at the age of ngc 2516 .",
    "it is therefore highly useful in this regard owing to both its age and relative proximity , where we can study solar mass stars after evolving for a short time on the main sequence , and lower mass stars as they finish pre main sequence evolution .",
    "the similarity in age to the pleiades ( modulo the uncertainty in this parameter ) means that comparisons of these clusters could be used to study the dependence of stellar parameters on environment .     of its @xmath28 age radius .",
    "the horizontal dashed line indicates the approximate @xmath29 age of ngc 2516.,width=307 ]    ngc 2516 is very well - studied in the literature .",
    "the most relevant existing work includes membership surveys ( @xcite , @xcite ) , characterisation of the mass function from solar mass @xcite down to the brown dwarf regime @xcite , a survey for radial velocities and binarity at the bright end of the cluster sequence @xcite , and studies of rotation using @xmath30 covering stars down to g spectral types ( @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "a number of x - ray surveys , including monitoring for variability , have also been carried out ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , the most recent of which @xcite used a deep _ xmm - newton _ observation to probe the low - mass members ( down to @xmath31 m5 ) of the cluster .",
    "they found that ngc 2516 stars are less luminous in x - rays than the pleiades members , and suggest that this may be attributed to slightly older age , or lower rotation rates .      for a discussion of the context of this work ,",
    "the reader is referred to our m34 publication in @xcite .",
    "the present survey probes a different open cluster of slightly younger age ( @xmath32 for ngc 2516 , compared to @xmath33 for m34 ) . due to the small distance modulus and our use of a larger telescope , the ngc 2516 survey probes lower masses , covering a range of @xmath34 , compared to @xmath35 in m34 , allowing the very low - mass stars to be examined in much greater detail",
    "this will allow models of angular momentum evolution to be tested over a wider range of stellar mass , in particular to determine whether models incorporating solid body rotation ( e.g. @xcite ) are able to reproduce the observed low - mass angular momentum evolution . at the lowest masses",
    ", core - envelope decoupling should not be relevant , since all the stars will be fully - convective and thus rotate approximately as solid bodies , allowing us to constrain directly the angular momentum loss law without needing to consider the details of internal angular momentum transport . at the age of ngc 2516 , stars with masses",
    "@xmath36 should be fully - convective @xcite .",
    "we have undertaken a photometric survey in ngc 2516 using the ctio 4 m blanco telescope and mosaic - ii imager .",
    "our goals are two - fold : first , to study rotation periods for a sample of low - mass members , covering m spectral types , down to @xmath37 , and second , to look for eclipsing binary systems containing low - mass stars , to obtain dynamical mass measurements in conjunction with radial velocities from follow - up spectroscopy .",
    "such systems provide the most accurate determinations of fundamental stellar parameters ( in particular , masses ) for input to models of stellar evolution , which are poorly constrained in this age range . we defer discussion of our eclipsing binary candidates to a later paper once we have obtained suitable follow - up spectroscopy .    these observations are part of a larger photometric monitoring survey of young open clusters over a range of ages and metalicities ( the monitor project ; @xcite and @xcite )",

    "briefly , we used the pipeline for the int wide - field survey @xcite for 2-d instrumental signature removal ( crosstalk correction , bias correction , flatfielding ) and astrometric and photometric calibration .",
    "we then generated the _ master catalogue _ for each filter by stacking @xmath58 of the frames taken in the best conditions ( seeing , sky brightness and transparency ) and running the source detection software on the stacked image .",

    "we achieved a per data point photometric precision of @xmath59 for the brightest objects , with rms scatter @xmath60 for @xmath61 ( see figure [ rmsplot ] ) .",
    "our source detection software flags as likely blends any objects detected as having overlapping isophotes .",
    "this information is used , in conjunction with a morphological image classification flag also generated by the pipeline software @xcite to allow us to identify non - stellar or blended objects in the time - series photometry .",
    "photometric calibration of our data was carried out using regular observations of @xcite equatorial standard star fields in the usual way .",
    "lightcurves were extracted from the data for @xmath62 objects , @xmath63 of which had stellar morphological classifications , using our standard aperture photometry techniques , described in @xcite .",
    "we fit a 2-d quadratic polynomial to the residuals in each frame ( measured for each object as the difference between its magnitude on the frame in question and the median calculated across all frames ) as a function of position , for each of the @xmath64 ccds separately .",
    "subsequent removal of this function accounted for effects such as varying differential atmospheric extinction across each frame . over a single ccd ,",

    "unfortunately , since we have avoided the very centre of the cluster in our field selection to reduce the effect of saturated bright stars on our ccd frames , the overlap in sky coverage between the present survey and many of the previous ones ( e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) is relatively poor .",

    "the error bars at the left - hand side of the plot indicate the typical photometric error for an object on the cluster sequence.,width=336 ]    candidate cluster members were selected by defining an empirical main sequence ` by eye ' to follow the clearly - visible cluster single - star sequence .",
    "the cuts were defined by moving this line along a vector perpendicular to the cluster sequence , by amounts @xmath77 and @xmath78 as measured along this vector , where @xmath79 is the photometric error in the @xmath39 colour .",
    "the values of @xmath80 used were @xmath81 for the lower line and @xmath82 for the upper line on the diagram , making the brighter region wider to avoid rejecting binary and multiple systems , which are overluminous for their colour compared to single stars .",
    "@xmath7 candidate photometric members were selected , over the full @xmath3 magnitude range from @xmath83 to @xmath84 , but the well - defined main sequence appears to terminate at the hydrogen burning mass limit of @xmath85 , or @xmath86 , with a few candidate brown dwarfs found below this limit , but with high field contamination .",
    "we also considered using the model isochrones of @xcite and @xcite for selecting candidate members .",
    "the nextgen model isochrones were found to be unsuitable due to the known discrepancy between these models and observations in the @xmath39 colour for @xmath87 ( corresponding here to @xmath88 ) .",
    "this was examined in more detail by @xcite , and is due to a missing source of opacity at these temperatures , leading to overestimation of the @xmath3-band flux .",
    "consequently , when we have used the nextgen isochrones to determine model masses and radii for our objects , the @xmath38-band absolute magnitudes were used to perform the relevant look - up , since these are less susceptible to the missing source of opacity , and hence give more robust estimates .",

    "the completeness for objects on the cluster sequence is @xmath90 down to the bd limit ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "we suspect that the gradual drop in completeness toward fainter magnitudes in figure [ comp ] results from a variable background in our ccd images caused by halos and scattered light from the many bright stars in the cluster field , impeding detection of faint sources in certain regions of the frame .",
    "system assuming objects to lie on the empirically - derived cluster main sequence track of  [ cmd_section ] and figure [ cmd ] .",
    "the diagram has been terminated at @xmath91 since we have not continued the selection of cluster members past this magnitude due to termination of the apparent main sequence in the cmd of figure [ cmd].,width=288 ]      in order to estimate the level of contamination in our catalogue , we used the besanon galactic models @xcite to generate a simulated catalogue of objects passing our selection criteria at the galactic coordinates of ngc 2516 ( @xmath92 , @xmath93 ) , covering the total fov of @xmath94 ( including gaps between detectors ) .",
    "we selected all objects over the apparent magnitude range @xmath95 , giving @xmath96 stars .",
    "the same selection process as above for the cluster members was then applied to find the contaminant objects .",
    "a total of @xmath97 simulated objects passed these membership selection criteria , giving an overall contamination level of @xmath98 .",
    "figure [ contam ] shows the contamination as a function of @xmath3 magnitude .",
    "we note that this figure is somewhat uncertain due to the need to use galactic models .",
    "follow - up data ( spectroscopy ) will be required to make a more accurate estimate .",
    "we note in particular that the apparently very high contamination in the @xmath99 bin , and possibly also the @xmath100 bin , is probably the result of the model poorly - fitting the observations , causing the contamination level to be overestimated .",
    "since the cluster binary sequence is so clearly visible in the cmd of figure [ cmd ] , we have computed a simple photometric lower limit for the binary fraction in the cluster as a function of mass , using the empirical isochrone to select stars with luminosities lying within a band of height @xmath101 centred on the single star cluster sequence , and the binary sequence ( obtained by shifting the cluster sequence by this amount to greater luminosities ) , illustrated in figure [ binary_diagram ] .",
    "this technique suffers from several sources of systematic error , including : ( a ) since the single star sequence is closer to the maximum of the distribution of field stars in the cmd , the single star counts are increased to a greater degree than the binary counts by field contamination , ( b ) binaries with mass ratios significantly different from @xmath102 lie closer to the single star sequence , and therefore tend not to be selected as binaries , and ( c ) at the faint end of the cmd the binaries are brighter , and hence more readily detected than single stars of the same colour .     versus @xmath39 cmd , as figure [ cmd ] , showing the selection of photometric candidate single stars ( grey ) and binaries ( black ) .",

    "a total of @xmath106 candidate binaries and @xmath107 candidate single stars were selected , giving an overall binary fraction of @xmath108 ( using poisson errors ) .",
    "we have been unable to use the more traditional @xmath109 cmd approach ( e.g. @xcite ) to determining limits on the binary fraction due to the lack of suitable near - ir data .",
    "2mass provides @xmath110-band photometry , but the resulting @xmath109 cmd did not show a clearly - visible binary sequence due to the large scatter caused by the photometric errors at the faint end of 2mass .    at this point , it is prudent to examine the sensitivity of our selection to the mass ratio @xmath111 of the binaries . to do this",
    ", we have simulated binaries over a range of @xmath111 from @xmath112 to @xmath113 , using the pms models to compute the total @xmath38-band luminosity of the binary , and our empirical isochrone to convert the individual @xmath38-band magnitudes of the primary and secondary to @xmath3-band , and hence place the objects on the @xmath4 cmd .",
    "our selection was then applied to determine the minimum mass ratio @xmath111 for the detected binaries , defined as @xmath114 ( where @xmath115 and @xmath116 are the primary and secondary masses , respectively ) . in general",
    "we find that our selection is sensitive to smaller mass ratios at lower masses , which could explain the form of the binary fraction as a function of mass seen in figure [ binaryfrac ] .",
    "the figure indicates that we are sensitive to @xmath117 over the entire mass range , and at best , @xmath118 at @xmath119 .",
    "comparing these values to those of @xcite , we find that the @xmath4 selection is slightly less sensitive to unequal mass ratio systems ( e.g. in their @xmath120 bin the minimum detectable mass ratio was @xmath121 whereas here it is @xmath122 ) .     for detection of binaries as a function of the primary mass @xmath115 using our cmd approach .",
    "computed using the nextgen ( for @xmath74 ) and dusty @xcite models ( for @xmath123 ) to convert between mass and @xmath38-band absolute magnitude , and our empirical main sequence isochrone to convert between @xmath38-band and @xmath3-band magnitudes .",
    "the curve is not smooth owing to the coarse binning used in our empirical isochrone.,width=288 ]    we note that since the completeness in figure [ comp ] is close to constant over the entire mass range covered by figure [ binaryfrac ] , the apparent increase in binary fraction toward lower masses is probably not an incompleteness effect resulting from lower completeness for the single star sequence , compared to the more luminous binary sequence .",
    "however , our selection is affected by field contamination , with a background of field objects falling inside the selection bins on the cmd . this will tend to decrease the computed binary fraction , since there are more field objects at the single star side of the selection region ( see figure [ cmd ] ) .",
    "it is difficult to correct for this effect until we have obtained follow - up spectroscopy .",
    "our results in @xmath4 are in good general agreement with those of @xcite , although it is difficult to distinguish whether our data are consistent with any change in the binary fraction as a function of mass , given the small number statistics ( and hence large poisson errors in figure [ binaryfrac ] ) and better sensitivity to small @xmath111 with decreasing mass ( leading presumably to more detections ) .",
    "photometric selection of binaries remains , to our knowledge , relatively untested , without detailed evaluation of the sensitivity .",
    "therefore , a more detailed and reliable study of binarity in ngc 2516 requires follow - up spectroscopy .",
    "the method we use for detection of periodic variables is described in detail in @xcite , and we provide only a brief summary here .",
    "the method uses least - squares fitting of sine curves to the time series @xmath124 ( in magnitudes ) for _ all _ candidate cluster members , using the form : @xmath125 where @xmath126 , @xmath23 ( the amplitude ) and @xmath127 ( the phase ) are free parameters at each value of @xmath128 over an equally - spaced grid of frequencies , corresponding to periods from @xmath129 for the present data - set .",
    "periodic variable lightcurves were selected by evaluating the change in reduced @xmath130 : @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the reduced @xmath130 of the original lightcurve with respect to a constant model , and @xmath133 is the reduced @xmath130 of the lightcurve with the smoothed , phase - folded version subtracted .",

    "the selected lightcurves were examined by eye , to define the final sample of periodic variables .",
    "a total of @xmath9 lightcurves were selected , with the remainder appearing non - variable or too ambiguous to be included .",
    "monte carlo simulations were performed following the method detailed in @xcite , injecting simulated signals of @xmath135 amplitude and periods chosen following a uniform distribution on @xmath136 period from @xmath137 to @xmath138 , into lightcurves covering a uniform distribution in mass , from @xmath139 to @xmath140 .",

    "the decaying parts of the histogram at the bright and faint ends may be caused by the increased field contamination here ( see figure [ contam ] ) , since we expect field objects on average show less rotational modulation than cluster objects , and/or incompleteness effects resulting from saturation for @xmath154 , and for @xmath155 , the gradual increase in the minimum amplitude of variations we can detect ( corresponding to the reduction in sensitivity moving to fainter stars , see figure [ rmsplot ] ) .",

    "we further note that the decline observed in m34 at faint magnitudes is probably indeed due to incompleteness as stated by @xcite , since a similar trend is also seen in the ngc 2516 data - set , displaced accordingly for the differences in sensitivity and distance modulus .",
    "we note that lower field contamination ( as evaluated in  [ contam_section ] ) is expected in the rotation sample than in the full candidate membership sample .",
    "typical field population ages for the young disc of @xmath158 ( @xcite , @xcite ) imply slower rotation rates by factors of a few than cluster members , reduced activity , implying smaller asymmetric components of the spot coverage and hence lower photometric amplitudes ( which probably render many of them undetectable ) .",

    "this suggests that slow rotators experience more angular momentum loss on the zams than the models predict .",
    "conversely , the solid body models provide a better fit to the fast rotators , especially in the mass range @xmath327 .",
    "this is not surprising in light of the conclusions of  [ ove_section ] .    in particular , the form of mass dependence for @xmath328 is approximately correct , with the exception of a small number of objects rotating faster than the apparent ` limit ' of @xmath329 seen in the ngc 2516 data .",
    "a small number of objects are also visible in the evolved ngc 2362 distribution above the @xmath194 relation seen for the slowest rotators in ngc 2516 .",
    "since these originated as relatively slow rotators in ngc 2362 , we suspect that they are the result of field contamination , or errors in the measured rotation periods in that sample due to the limited time baseline of the observations .",
    "this work suggests that the mass dependence of the observed rotation period distribution is reproduced by the combination of the initial conditions as seen in ngc 2362 , the mass - dependence of stellar contraction on the pms , and the mass - dependence of the saturation angular velocity @xmath253 .",
    "furthermore , the convergence in rotation rates as a function of time ( see also figure [ pevol ] ) is explained reasonably well by saturation of the angular momentum losses , over the mass range of interest for ngc 2516 , apparently without need to invoke any further effects .",
    "figure [ jmd_n2362_evol_m34 ] shows the same comparison for m34 , showing that the feature of constant rotation period as a function of mass for @xmath205 is also well - reproduced by the models , at approximately the correct period in the case of the differentially rotating models , and again at a shorter period than the observed value for the solid body models .",
    "it should be noted that the adopted values of @xmath253 in this mass range are not well - constrained by the ngc 2516 data used to calibrate them , and have a strong effect on the morphology of this part of the diagram , so it is possible that any deviations here result from our assumption of a linear relation over the entire mass range .     to evolve the ngc 2362 distribution of figure [ pmd ] forward in time from @xmath325 to @xmath330 for the solid body ( upper panel ) and differentially rotating ( middle panel ) models , and the observed m34 distribution for comparison ( lower panel).,title=\"fig:\",width=288 ]   to evolve the ngc 2362 distribution of figure [ pmd ] forward in time from @xmath325 to @xmath330 for the solid body ( upper panel ) and differentially rotating ( middle panel ) models , and the observed m34 distribution for comparison ( lower panel).,title=\"fig:\",width=288 ]   to evolve the ngc 2362 distribution of figure [ pmd ] forward in time from @xmath325 to @xmath330 for the solid body ( upper panel ) and differentially rotating ( middle panel ) models , and the observed m34 distribution for comparison ( lower panel).,title=\"fig:\",width=288 ]",

    "the likely field contamination level was estimated using a simulated catalogue of field objects from the besanon galactic models @xcite , finding that @xmath331 objects were likely field contaminants , an overall contamination level of @xmath98 , implying that there are @xmath8 real cluster members over this mass range in our field - of - view .",

    "our earlier m34 results indicate that for @xmath205 , the slowest rotators follow instead @xmath15 as a function of mass , with a transition between the two regimes at @xmath206 .",

    "the results indicate that a mass - dependent saturation velocity ( e.g. of the form suggested by @xcite ) is required to reproduce the observations .",
    "furthermore , we find that solid body rotation is sufficient to explain the evolution of the fastest rotators , but core - envelope decoupling appears to be needed to explain the evolution of the slowest rotators",
    ". this may indicate that the redistribution of angular momentum at the core / envelope boundary is more efficient in fast rotators .",
    "we were unable to find a model which fits both the fast and slow rotators simultaneously .",
    "further rotation period measurements at low masses , particularly for ages intermediate between @xmath293 and @xmath29 and for ages @xmath294 , will provide more stringent constraints on the models , but the present observations already indicate the need for more theoretical work .    we intend to publish the final catalogue of ngc 2516 membership candidates after obtaining follow - up spectroscopy .",
