    "the recent revival of interest in alternative gravity models , motivated chiefly by the possibility of explaining the accelerated expansion of the universe and the flattening of the rotation curves of galaxies without the need to introduce dark energy and matter , has led to a number of studies on the so - called `` @xmath0 theories '' , where the linear scalar curvature term of the einstein - hilbert action is replaced by a more general function of the same invariant @xcite .",
    "although these models have attracted a great deal of attention , it is interesting to take the generalization a step further and consider a non - minimal coupling between matter and geometry  @xcite , which can be achieved by postulating an action of the form @xmath1\\sqrt{-g}dx^{4 } , \\label{eq : s}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 are arbitrary functions of the scalar curvature @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the lagrangian density of matter , @xmath5 is the metric determinant , and @xmath6 is a coupling constant that can be used to gauge the contribution of @xmath7 . the standard einstein - hilbert action is recovered by taking @xmath8 and @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the cosmological constant .",
    "varying action ( [ eq : s ] ) with respect to the metric coefficients yields the field equations @xmath12 @xmath13 where @xmath14 , and the energy - momentum tensor is defined , as usual , by @xmath15    among the various interesting features of this model , perhaps the most striking is the non - conservation law @xmath16 this work aims to examine the implications of eq .",

    "this paper is organized as follows : section [ sec : sas ] explores the possibility of adapting static , axially symmetric metrics to regions of space - time permeated by a presureless perfect fluid in or near hydrostatic equilibrium , and discusses the schwarzschild - like case in some detail ; a generalization of the newtonian potential is examined in section [ sec : gnp ] , and its implications are briefly discussed . in section [ sec : conc ] we present our conclusions .",

    "it is pointless to consider a vacuum situation . as such",
    ", we will admit a matter distribution modeled by a pressureless perfect fluid in or close to hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "this case is chosen as it exhibits two attractive features : firstly , it is sufficiently simple to be treated analytically , while still displaying the consequences of a non - minimal coupling ; secondly , it can be used to model a number of physically interesting systems .",
    "one can then write @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the density , and @xmath21 .",

    "having discussed the model in a general axially symmetric framework , we are now in conditions to add up further assumptions so that it is possible to evaluate its applicability to situations of physical interest .",
    "spherical symmetry is perhaps the simplest case to consider . in that case",

    "( [ eq : fe ] ) still seem to be too involved to allow for a straightforward mathematical treatment , even considering the general relativistic choice @xmath76 for the geometric part of the lagrangian . as such",
    ", we will try to pursue a different approach here , motivated chiefly by comparisons with gr .",
    "though less rigorous , it allows establishing some tentative results , possibly shedding some light into the physical meaning of the non - minimal coupling .",
    "consider the case of a spherical black hole of mass @xmath77 surrounded by a pressureless perfect fluid of density @xmath20 .",
    "we could argue that the space - time structure in the vicinity of a bh is dominated by its presence , and try to describe it using the familiar metric @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80,@xmath81 as above , where @xmath35 is the usual schwarzschild radius .",
    "however , this choice has @xmath82 for some @xmath40 , violating the condition imposed upon @xmath26 at the very inception of this model .",
    "naturally , there are a number of different ways to tackle this issue .",

    "this modification stems from the fact that for @xmath88 one recovers a spherically symmetric vaccum metric , i.e. , @xmath89 .",

    "finally , notice that @xmath94 controls the onset of a vaccum metric .",
    "again , we shall show that about 90% of the fluid s mass is concentrated inside a sphere of radius @xmath95 , suggesting that we should take @xmath96 .",
    "although this choice makes the coupling singular at @xmath97 , this is not much of a problem , as the curvature scalar is also singular there , and it could be taken @xmath98 and later assume @xmath99 .",

    "bearing in mind the discussion presented above , one expects that sufficiently far away from the black hole a schwarzschild metric should reasonably describe the system ( provided @xmath76 , an assumption we are considering through the rest of this work ) .",
    "this motivates the ansatz @xmath79 , or @xmath106 it may be that both @xmath26 and @xmath75 deviate considerably from an exact solution at some points .",
    "however , they should hold reasonably well in the outer region , and we expect that the added constant may approximately reproduce the dynamics of the inner region too .",
    "moreover , the assumed simple forms allow for a straightforward calculation of the curvature scalar @xmath107 as previously pointed out , there is a singularity at @xmath97 , and the horizon condition @xmath108 yields @xmath109 , that is , the event horizon coincides with the singularity .    ) as a function of @xmath110 : the laplacian one @xmath111 , in dashed line , and the remaining trace term @xmath112 , in full line .",

    "dividing eq .",
    "( [ eq : rrorelation ] ) by the corresponding gr relation leads to @xmath119 eq .",
    "( [ eq : gr - nmc ] ) suggests the following physical picture : if at some point @xmath120 , then @xmath121 , meaning gr s space - time can accommodate a greater density of matter when compared to the nmc case . from an energetic point of view , and recalling that we are dealing with a static equilibrium situation , the amount of matter that minimizes the potential is inferior in the nmc scenario .",
    "the contrary holds if @xmath122 . to summarize , the nmc is energetically favorable ( in the sense that it accommodates more matter than gr in equilibrium conditions ) if @xmath122 , and unfavorable in case @xmath120 . from eq .",
