    "hd  141569a ( spectral type b9.5ve ; jaschek & jaschek 1992 ) is one of a few stars from which excess infrared radiation has been detected by iras and for which an associated circumstellar debris disk has been imaged in reflected light .",
    "although hd  141569a was initially classified as an a - type shell star with infrared excess ( jaschek , jaschek , & egret 1986 ) , it has properties common to both herbig ae / be stars and young main - sequence stars ( fisher et al .",
    "2000 ) .    images of hd  141569a s circumstellar disk show complex structure ( weinberger et al .  1999 , hereafter w99 ; augereau et al .  1999 ,",
    "hereafter a99 ) that might be attributed to gravitational perturbation by one or more planets ( w99 ; mouillet et al .  2001 , hereafter m01 ) .",
    "other studies conclude that the 5  myr - old disk may be too young to have formed jovian planets ( weinberger et al .",
    "2000 ) and have proposed alternative sculpting mechanisms , such as dust migration ( takeuchi & artymowicz 2001 ) .",
    "the disk has a fractional infrared excess luminosity of @xmath7  three times that of @xmath8 pic s disk ( sylvester et al .",
    "1996 )  and has been imaged to a radius of @xmath9  au . at a distance of 99 pc ( esa 1997 ) ,",
    "the disk has has an angular radius of @xmath10 and is therefore an ideal target for imaging with _",
    "_ hst s _ advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) high resolution channel ( hrc ) features a coronagraph that suppresses the wings of the point - spread function ( psf ) by factors of 5 to 10 .",
    "when combined with reference psf subtraction , the contrast between faint circumstellar material and the scattered light from a bright star can be improved by factors of 5001000 ( krist et al .",
    "2002 ) at a radial distance of 2@xmath11 .",
    "the hrc coronagraph images of hd  141569a presented here show the complex structure of the disk with unprecedented resolution and provide new information about the disk s color .",
    "hd  141569a was observed with the hrc coronagraph on ut 2002 july 21 as part of the acs early release observation ( ero ) program .",
    "the angular size of an hrc pixel is 0028@xmath12 0025 , and the fwhm of the unocculted coronagraphic field psf is 0050 in the @xmath1 band .",
    "the star was positioned behind the 18-diameter occulting spot .",
    "a sequence of images was recorded over two orbits , after which _ hst _ was rolled by 28@xmath13 and the sequence was repeated .",
    "this roll offset permits the distinction of psf features , which are stationary with roll , from real disk structure , whose orientation on the detector changes with roll .",
    "each sequence comprised the following filters and exposures : f435w ( @xmath0 ) , @xmath14  s , @xmath15  s ; f606w ( broad @xmath1 ) , @xmath16  s , @xmath17  s ; f814w ( @xmath2 ) , @xmath16  s , @xmath18  s. the long exposures were not saturated , so the short ones were not used in our analysis .",
    "the images were reduced using the standard techniques of bias and dark subtraction and division by a flat field .",
    "because the coronagraphic spots shifted during launch , the pre - launch coronagraphic flat fields could not be applied directly to our images . moreover ,",
    "on - orbit flat fields were not available .",
    "consequently , we constructed suitable flat fields by shifting the coronagraphic illumination pattern ( including the occulting spot shadows ) within the pre - launch flat fields .",
    "the flattened images were then combined using a standard cosmic - ray rejection algorithm .",
    "the calibrated images of hd  141569a reveal the presence of the disk , but the coronagraphic psf still dominates the images ( figure  1 ) .",
    "the coronagraph effectively suppresses the diffracted light below the level of scattered light caused by mid - frequency surface errors in _",
    "hst s _ mirrors .",
    "the occulting spot itself diffracts light into a concentrated area around the perimeter of the imaged spot . because the coronagraphic psf is stable ,",
    "most of this residual light can be subtracted using an image of a suitable reference star , improving the contrast .",
    "techniques for subtracting hrc coronagraphic psfs are described by krist et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and summarized in the acs instrument handbook ( pavlovsky et al .",
    "2002 ) . because the positions of the occulting spots in the image plane are not static , optimal psf subtraction can be achieved only when images of the target and spectrally - similar reference stars are recorded contemporaneously .",
    "previous studies of hd  141569a s disk with nicmos ( w99 ; a99 ) and stis ( m01 ) employed psf subtraction , usually with a single reference star .",
    "w99 used three reference stars observed at various times and selected the one that provided the best subtraction . because the ero program produced the first on - orbit images taken with the hrc coronagraph",
    ", we are limited to using one set of reference - star images for psf subtraction .",
    "we observed the reference star hd  129433 immediately after hd  141569a .",
    "both stars have the same spectral type , but hd  129433 is less reddened ( @xmath0@xmath19 , versus 0.09 ) .",
    "the images of hd  129433 were normalized to , aligned with , and subtracted from the corresponding images of hd  141569a ( figures  1 and 2 ) .",
    "normalization and alignment of the hd  129433 images were achieved by simultaneously and iteratively scaling and shifting using cubic - convolution interpolation .",
    "convergence was achieved when the subtraction residuals were visually minimized .",
    "alignment of the images is accurate to within @xmath20  pixel ( @xmath21  00013 ) .",
    "the normalizations of the corresponding images are accurate to within 2% .",
    "this normalization error corresponds to photometric errors of 0.02  mag  arcsec@xmath22 and 0.1  mag  arcsec@xmath22 in the brightest and faintest regions of the disk , respectively.with only one available reference star , we can not quantify the subtraction errors caused by mismatches of the stars colors or time - dependent psf variations .",
    "the largest residuals in each psf - subtracted image appear at the perimeter of the occulting spot , where the psf is most sensitive to star - to - spot registration .",
    "these residuals force the exclusion of data within @xmath23 ( 120  au ) of the star .",
    "radial streaks caused by mismatches in registration , color , and focus also appear in the subtracted images .",
    "the f814w images are the most affected by residuals , probably because of large star - to - spot misalignments . after correcting for geometric distortion and rotating to a common orientation ,",
    "the images for each filter were combined so that the final images reflected the smallest subtraction residuals from each of the constituent images ( figure  3 ) .    to derive the optical depth of hd  141569a s disk , the images must be normalized by the stellar flux .",
    "unfortunately , it was not possible to obtain unsaturated images of hd  141569a and hd  129433 through hrc broadband filters . consequently , we computed the flux from each star through each filter using the stsdas synthetic photometry package synphot , which simulates most _ hst _ observing configurations . to approximate hd  129433 s spectrum , we normalized vega s spectrum to @xmath24 ( hoffleit & jaschek 1982 ) with @xmath25 and assumed invariability .",
    "we also used vega s spectrum for hd  141569a with @xmath26 ( oudmaijer et al .",
    "2001 ) . because hd  141569a is a known variable , we scaled its spectrum so that the ratio of the synthetic f606w fluxes of hd  141569a and hd  129433 , @xmath27 , was equal to the average brightness ratio of the aligned f606w coronagraphic psfs of the two stars .",
    "the resulting magnitude for hd  141569a , @xmath28 , matches well the published measurement of de  winter et al .",
    "we then compared the ratios of the stars flux - ratios through different filters ( e.g. , @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) computed from the coronagraphic psfs and from the synthetic spectra .",
    "the actual and synthetic flux ratios differed by less than 1% .",
    "this agreement indicates that the broadband colors of the synthetic spectra are well matched to the stars colors , and that the spectra can be used to produce accurate synthetic fluxes through the hrc filters .",
    "the psf - subtracted images of the disk were normalized to the synthetic fluxes of hd  141569a , assuming a 52.5% throughput reduction caused by the coronagraph s lyot stop .",
    "our psf - subtracted images yield a clearer and more detailed view of the disk than seen in previous _ hst _",
    "images obtained with nicmos ( w99 ; a99 ) and stis ( m01 ) .",
    "the disk has four distinct annular zones : an inner clearing within @xmath31  au of the star , a bright `` ring '' with a sharp inner edge from @xmath32  au to @xmath33  au , a faint zone from @xmath33  au to @xmath34  au , and a broad `` ring '' from @xmath34  au to @xmath35  au .",
    "( all distances are measured along the disk s southern semimajor axis . )",
    "as shown in section  4 , the inner and outer rings appear to be thin and tightly wound spirals of dust .",
    "faint , broad arcs superposed upon fainter and more diffuse dust extend from the northeast and southwest regions of the disk ( figure  4 ) .",
    "the diffuse dust in the northeast extends @xmath36  au from hd  141569a .",
    "the arcs resemble open spiral arms , and the southwest one extends toward the binary star hd  141569bc located @xmath37  85 to the northwest of hd  141569a .",
    "figure  4 also shows two faint stars , labeled 1 and 2 , located 63 and 80 from hd  141569a at position angles 12.5@xmath13 and 210.0@xmath13 , respectively .",
    "their @xmath1 magnitudes are @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "their colors are consistent with slightly reddened k stars or extincted , earlier - type stars , and we conclude that they are background stars",
    ".    figures 5 and 6 show the @xmath1-band surface brightness of the disk , derived from the f606w images after azimuthal filtering ( described below ) .",
    "the surface brightness ranges from @xmath40  mag  arcsec@xmath22 in the inner ring to @xmath41  mag  arcsec@xmath22 at the furthest extent of detection .",
    "large azimuthal variations in the surface brightness of the disk are evident ; the brightness of the outer ring varies by a factor of 2.5 . the f814w / f606w and f814w / f435w ratios of the average surface brightness of the disk",
    "are @xmath42% and @xmath43% larger , respectively , than the corresponding flux ratios of hd  141569a .",
    "these ratios correspond to @xmath0@xmath3 and @xmath1@xmath4 , which indicate that the disk is significantly redder than the star .",
    "there is no evidence of color variation across the disk above the levels set by the local psf - subtraction residuals .",
    "the north  south orientation of the semimajor axis of the projected disk and the likely condition of forward scattering by dust ( w99 ) imply that the brighter , eastern side of the disk is nearer to us . to investigate the scattering properties further",
    ", we created a composite image of the disk by summing the f435w and f606w images after normalizing them to a common average surface brightness .",
    "( because the f814w image has relatively large psf - subtraction residuals , it was not included in the composite image . ) assuming that the disk is optically thin and flat , and that it has an inclination angle of 55@xmath13 from pole - on ( m01 ) , we deprojected the composite image to simulate a face - on view of the disk ( figure  7a ) .",
    "the radial subtraction residuals seen in the constituent images ( figure  2 ) were diminished by azimuthally filtering the combined image ( figure  7b ) .",
    "each pixel was replaced with the median value of a seven - pixel arc centered on the geometic center used in the deprojection procedure .",
    "this technique exploits the disk s slow azimuthal variations while preserving its more rapid radial ones .",
    "each pixel in the azimuthally filtered image was then multiplied by the square of its distance from hd  141569a to compensate for the radially diminishing stellar illumination in the optically - thin disk ( figure  7c ) .",
    "the enhanced brightness of the near side of the disk and its symmetry along the line of sight as shown in this image indicates significant forward scattering of starlight by the dust .",
    "w99 derived a scattering asymmetry parameter of @xmath44 ( henyey & greenstein 1941 ) for the disk based on a measured east / west brightness ratio of @xmath45 and an assumption of azimuthally uniform disk density distribution .",
    "however , our images show that the disk is not azimuthally uniform .",
    "consequently , we visually fitted a henyey  greenstein phase function to our entire deprojected f435w + f606w image , accounting for the inclination .",
    "we adjusted @xmath46 until the region of symmetrical brightness enhancement along the disk s near side was made consistent with the overall azimuthal brightness trend ( figure  7d ) .",
    "we obtained satisfactory results for @xmath47 , which is consistent with the results of m01 .",
    "because the color of the disk appears uniform , this range of @xmath46 is valid for all visual wavelengths .",
    "depending on the infrared properties of the dust , @xmath46 may decrease for wavelengths longer than @xmath48 m .",
    "for example , isotropic scattering ( @xmath49 ) would explain the brighter western side of the disk in @xmath50 m images obtained with nicmos ( a99 ) .",
    "figure  7d maps the product of the dust s albedo ( @xmath51 ) and its optical depth perpendicular to the plane of the disk ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "this is proportional to @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the scattering opacity and @xmath55 is the surface mass density of the dust .",
    "the map of @xmath56 enhances the features within the disk , especially the tightly - wound spiral structure of the inner and outer rings .",
    "these tight spirals and the broad , open spiral arms extending beyond the outer ring are traced in figure  8 .",
    "the outer ring unwinds counterclockwise , circumscribing about @xmath57 of arc .",
    "the spiral overlaps itself in the northeast with a separation of @xmath58  au .",
    "it also splits into the open spiral arms in the northeast and southwest .",
    "the inner ring also unwinds counterclockwise and overlaps itself from northeast to southeast .",
    "this spiral appears to merge with the outer spiral in the southeast , thereby filling the previously described gap between the inner and outer rings about 250  au from the star .",
    "the interior of the inner ring appears relatively devoid of dust .",
    "figure  9 is a color - coded version of figure  7d with an expanded field of view and a calibrated brightness scale .",
    "assuming @xmath54 is uniform throughout the disk ( consistent with the observed color uniformity ) , @xmath55 is @xmath6 times greater in the southwest region of the outer ring than in the northeast .",
    "the peak of the apparent optical depth in the outer ring is @xmath59 , assuming @xmath5 . w99",
    "derived a mean @xmath60 for the entire outer ring without correcting for forward scattering .",
    "because the hrc s occulting spots lie in the spherically aberrated beam from _ hst _ , some aberrated starlight passes by the spots and is corrected by the hrc optics .",
    "this corrected light forms a diminished image of the star on the detector within the imaged shadow of the spot ( figure  1 ) , which allows direct measurement of the star s position .",
    "( this technique was verified during post - launch calibration of acs . )",
    "our images suggest that hd  141569a is not located at the center of the circumstellar disk .",
    "however , the disk s spiral structure precludes an accurate determination of its center .",
    "the offset appears to be of order @xmath3730 au toward the west side of the disk , but the uncertainty in the measurement could exceed @xmath3710 au .",
    "an offset is also reported in stis images of the disk ( g.  schneider 2002 , private communication ) .",
    "m01 did not report a star - to - disk offset in their stis images , but they did note that the centers of the inner and outer rings are offset by 0.2  au .",
    "we do not see an offset between the rings we show in figure  8 although , once again , the spiral structure complicates such a measurement .",
    "spiral structure has been observed in the circumstellar disk around hd  100546 ( grady et al .",
    "2001 ) , but that disk does not possess the open and extended spiral arms seen in hd  141569a s disk .",
    "the presence of these arms , the apparent association of the southwest arm with hd  141569bc , the large azimuthal density variations of the disk , and the @xmath61  au offset of hd  141569a relative to the center of the disk are characteristics consistent with the tidal effects of encounters between circumstellar disks and passing stars ( pfalzner , henning , & kley 2000 ; larwood & kalas 2001 ) .",
    "if hd  141569a and hd  141569bc are bound , then a few hundred encounters between the disk and hd  141569bc could have occurred over the 5  myr age of the system . under such circumstances",
    ", the disk would be tidally truncated at a distance of @xmath620.4 times the semimajor axis of the orbit and its outer regions would develop spiral structure ( artymowicz & lubow 1994 ) .",
    "the eccentricity of the hd  141569a / bc system would also induce eccentricity in the disk that could account for the displacement of the disk with respect to hd  141569a .",
    "detailed dynamical modeling of the system is required to explore fully the possible interaction of the disk with hd  141569bc .",
    "the redness of the disk relative to hd  141569a indicates that the grain properties are different from those of the neutrally - colored but older disk around @xmath8  pictoris .",
    "however , the color of hd  141569a s disk is similar to hr  4796a s disk ( schneider & silverstone 2002 ) and indicates that the scattering efficiency of the dust increases with wavelength . while our images can not strongly constrain the distribution and size of the dust grains , they do permit quantitative speculation .",
    "for example , a reasonable match to the observed colors is obtained if we assume that the grains are composed of `` astronomical silicate '' ( laor & draine 1993 ; draine & lee 1984 ) , and that the distribution of grain sizes obeys a power law with an index of 3.5 and radii extrema of @xmath63 m and @xmath64 m . these assumptions imply a @xmath1-band albedo of @xmath65 .",
    "other combinations of the grain composition , size distribution , and albedo may , however , produce equally good matches to the observed disk colors . nevertheless , the size distribution quoted above is consistent with that derived by a99 from the disk s 8@xmath66 m spectral energy distribution and an assumed composition of silicate grains , organic refractories , and water ice .",
    "the spatial uniformity of the disk s color does not necessarily imply that the distribution of grain sizes is constant throughout the disk .",
    "the colors are not sensitive to the distribution of grains with sizes @xmath67 m .",
    "therefore , color uniformity alone is not inconsistent with the scenario of dust segregation in the presence of stellar radiation pressure ( takeuchi & artymowicz 2001 ) .",
    "however , the azimuthally varying density distribution of the grains ( figure  9 ) and the protracted time scale of such segregation relative to possible periodic encounters with hd  141569bc make dust segregation an unlikely cause of the observed disk structure .",
    "the complex structure of the disk prompts us to reconsider the potential influence of a very - low - mass companion on the disk s morphology .",
    "w99 have suggested that the depleted region of the disk from @xmath33300  au could be produced from tidal clearing by a jupiter - sized planet in the gap itself .",
    "takeuchi & artymowicz ( 2001 ) and klahr & lin ( 2002 ) have argued that the arcs seen in the disks around hr  4796a and hd  141569a may not necessarily be indicators of embedded planets .",
    "current theories suggest that planet formation at such large distances from hd  141569a is unlikely within 5  myr ( boss 1998 ) .",
    "moreover , takeuchi & artymowicz ( 2001 ) argue that the creation of a circular depleted region by an outwardly migrating planet is unlikely .",
    "alternatively , hd  141569bc may have induced the scattering of a planet from a small orbit to the gap .",
    "thommes , duncan , & levison ( 2002 ) have also shown that planets within 100  au may scatter objects out to 300  au .",
    "whether the orbit of a scattered planet within hd  141569a s disk could circularize within 5  myr is unclear . on the other hand",
    ", the cause of the gap need not be in the gap itself ; a planet in a close orbit might clear the gap via excited density waves within its outer lindblad resonance ( goldreich & tremaine 1978 ) .",
    "indeed , brittain & rettig ( 2002 ) have presented evidence for h@xmath68 within 17  au of hd  141569a , which may be attributed to the extended envelope of a protoplanet .",
    "all these possibilities remain to be investigated .",
    "our images do not exclude a planet as the mechanism responsible for some of the disk s structure .",
    "the causes of the complicated structures observed in the dust disks around hd  141569a and other young stars clearly require further investigation and modeling .",
    "as our images demonstrate , the acs coronagraph can produce images of these disks with unprecedented resolution and contrast .",
    "such high - quality images permit the type of studies necessary to address quantitatively the many outstanding questions regarding the composition , dynamics , and evolution of protoplanetary disks .",
