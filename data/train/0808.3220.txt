    "the subject of this note is a correspondence between open book decompositions on contact manifolds and @xmath2holomorphic curves in their symplectizations",
    ". we will assume throughout that @xmath3 is a closed @xmath0manifold with a positive , cooriented contact structure .",
    "an _ open book decomposition _ of @xmath4 is a fibration @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a link called the _ binding _ , and the fibers are called _ pages _ : these are open surfaces whose closures have boundary equal to  @xmath7 .",
    "an open book is called _ planar _ if the pages have genus zero , and it is said to _ support _ a contact structure @xmath8 if the latter can be written as @xmath9 for some contact form @xmath10 ( a _ giroux form _ ) such that @xmath11 is positive on the pages and @xmath10 is positive on the binding ( oriented as the boundary of the pages ) . in this case",
    "the reeb vector field @xmath12 defined by @xmath10 is transverse to the pages and parallel to the binding , so in particular the binding is a union of periodic orbits .",
    "a picture of a simple open book on the tight @xmath0sphere is shown in figure  [ fig : openbook ] .",
    "an open book decomposition of the tight @xmath0sphere with one binding orbit and disk - like pages , which are transverse to the reeb vector field . ]",
    "we say that an almost complex structure @xmath2 on @xmath13 is _ compatible with @xmath10 _ if it is invariant under the natural @xmath1action , maps the unit vector in the @xmath1direction to @xmath12 and restricts to @xmath8 as a complex structure compatible with @xmath14 .",
    "one then considers @xmath2holomorphic curves @xmath15 where the domain is a closed riemann surface with finitely many punctures , and @xmath16 satisfies a finite energy condition ( see @xcite ) , so that it has `` asymptotically cylindrical '' behavior at the punctures , approaching closed orbits of @xmath12 at @xmath17 .",
    "note that whenever the projection of @xmath16 into @xmath4 is embedded , it is also transverse to @xmath12 , a property that is shared by the pages of supporting open books with their giroux forms .",
    "thus it is natural to ask whether the pages of an open book can in general be presented as projections of holomorphic curves : such a family of holomorphic curves is referred to as a _",
    "holomorphic open book _ , and is a special case of a _ finite energy foliation _ ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we refer to @xcite for further details on the rich relationship between open books and contact structures , and @xcite for some applications of holomorphic curves in this context to dynamics .",
    "our main goal is to prove the following .",
    "suppose @xmath18 is a planar open book decomposition on @xmath4 that supports  @xmath8 .",
    "then after an isotopy of @xmath19 , it admits a nondegenerate giroux form @xmath10 with a compatible almost complex structure @xmath2 on the symplectization @xmath13 , and a smooth @xmath20dimensional @xmath1invariant family of embedded , finite energy @xmath2holomorphic curves in @xmath13 with index  @xmath20 , whose projections to @xmath4 give an @xmath21family of embeddings parametrizing the pages of  @xmath19 .",
    "[ remark : smallperiods ] it will be clear from the construction that one can choose the giroux form @xmath10 in this theorem so that the binding orbits have arbitrarily small periods compared with all other reeb orbits in  @xmath4 .",
    "this assumption is sometimes useful for compactness arguments , and is exploited e.g.  in @xcite .",
    "this result has been used in the literature for various applications , including abbas - cieliebak - hofer s proof of the weinstein conjecture for planar contact manifolds @xcite , and the author s theorem that strong symplectic fillings of such manifolds are always blowups of stein fillings @xcite .",
    "a construction of holomorphic open books was sketched in @xcite without many details .",
    "the construction explained below is based on a completely different idea , and has the advantage of producing a ( usually non - stable ) finite energy foliation out of _ any _ open book , with arbitrary genus .",
    "the catch is that this construction requires a choice of @xmath2 which is not compatible with @xmath10 in the sense described above , but is instead compatible with a _",
    "stable hamiltonian structure _ , which can be seen as a limit of @xmath10 as the contact structure degenerates to a confoliation .",
    "the idea is then to recover the contact case by a perturbation argument , but for analytical reasons , this can only be done with a planar open book .",
    "the trouble with the non - planar case is that holomorphic curves of higher genus with the desired intersection theoretic properties never have positive index , and thus generically can not exist .",
    "this problem has an analogue in the study of closed symplectic @xmath22manifolds , namely in mcduff s classification @xcite of manifolds that admit nonnegative symplectic spheres  there is no corresponding result for higher genus symplectic surfaces because the dimension of the moduli space of higher genus holomorphic curves is generally too small . in the contact setting , a potential remedy was proposed by hofer in @xcite , who suggested considering a more general elliptic problem in which a harmonic @xmath23form is introduced to raise the index .",
    "the study of this problem is a large project in progress by c.  abbas @xcite and abbas - hofer - lisi @xcite , in which punctured holomorphic curves of genus zero are treated as an easy special case : this would be a necessary ingredient to generalize the approach in @xcite to the weinstein conjecture in dimension three .",
    "for other applications however , it is already helpful to know that any open book can be viewed as a family of @xmath2holomorphic curves for some non - generic choice of  @xmath2 .",
    "this idea is exploited for instance in @xcite to compute certain algebraic invariants of contact manifolds based on holomorphic curves , and in @xcite to define previously unknown obstructions to symplectic filling .",
    "our construction rests on the notion of an _ abstract open book _ , which is defined by the data @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is a compact oriented surface with boundary representing the _ page _ , and @xmath26 is a diffeomorphism that fixes the boundary , called the _ monodromy map_. without loss of generality , we can assume that @xmath26 is the identity in a neighborhood of @xmath27 .",
    "let @xmath28 denote the _ mapping torus _ of @xmath26 , which is the smooth @xmath0manifold with boundary , @xmath29 where @xmath30 .",
    "this comes with a natural fibration @xmath31 , so that the tangent spaces to  @xmath25 define a @xmath20plane distribution in  @xmath32 , called the _",
    "vertical distribution_.    [ prop : shs ] given an abstract open book @xmath24 , let @xmath4 denote the closed @xmath0manifold obtained by gluing solid tori to @xmath28 so that @xmath24 defines an open book decomposition of  @xmath4 .",
    "then the vertical distribution on @xmath28 can be extended to @xmath4 as a confoliation @xmath33 , such that a @xmath34small perturbation of @xmath33 defines a contact structure @xmath35 supported by the open book , and each is compatible with stable hamiltonian structures @xmath36 and @xmath37 such that @xmath38 is @xmath34close to @xmath39 .",
    "we will prove this via a concrete construction in the next section , after recalling precisely what a stable hamiltonian structure @xmath40 is , and how it defines a special class of almost complex structures on @xmath13 .",
    "the next step is the following :    [ prop : j0openbook ] given @xmath24 , @xmath4 and @xmath36 as in proposition  [ prop : shs ] , there exists an almost complex structure @xmath41 compatible with @xmath39 such that the pages of the open book on  @xmath4 lift to embedded @xmath41holomorphic curves in @xmath13 , with positive ends and index @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the genus of  @xmath25",
    ".    we will prove this in  [ sec : fef ] , and recall the definition of the _ index _ of a @xmath2holomorphic curve and its significance .",
    "we ll then show that the index  @xmath20 curves obtained in the case @xmath44 survive as a holomorphic open book under the small perturbation from @xmath39 to  @xmath38 , thus proving the main theorem .",
    "thanks to dietmar salamon and sam lisi for helpful conversations .",
    "stable hamiltonian structures were introduced in @xcite ( although the name came somewhat later , cf .",
    "@xcite ) as a generalized setting for holomorphic curves in symplectizations that accomodates both contact geometry and floer homology , among other things . given a closed oriented @xmath0manifold @xmath4 , a stable hamiltonian structure @xmath40 is defined by    1 .",
    "a coorientable @xmath20plane distribution @xmath45 , 2 .",
    "a vector field @xmath46 ( the _ reeb vector field _ ) that is everywhere transverse to @xmath8 and has flow preserving @xmath8 , 3 .   a closed @xmath20form @xmath47 ( the _ taming form _ ) such that @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "one can associate to @xmath40 the unique @xmath23form @xmath10 such that @xmath50 and @xmath51 , which then automatically satisfies @xmath52 .",
    "moreover , @xmath49 implies that the flow of @xmath46 preserves not only @xmath8 but also its symplectic structure defined by @xmath53 .",
    "now , given @xmath54 , the so - called _ symplectization _",
    "@xmath13 inherits a natural splitting @xmath55 , and we use this to define a special class of almost complex structures @xmath56 on @xmath13 , so that for every @xmath57 ,    1 .",

    "notice that the definition of @xmath56 depends on @xmath47 only up to the _ conformally _ symplectic structure that it induces on  @xmath8 .",
    "thus one can always replace @xmath40 by @xmath62 for any smooth function @xmath63 with @xmath64 ; then @xmath65 , and the notions of finite energy @xmath2holomorphic curves defined via @xmath54 and @xmath66 coincide .",
    "if the distribution @xmath8 in @xmath40 is a contact structure , then any choice of @xmath10 with @xmath50 defines @xmath46 uniquely : in standard contact geometric terms , it is the reeb vector field determined by the contact form @xmath10 . in this case one can also take @xmath11 as a natural taming form , though as mentioned above , it is not the _ only _ choice .",
    "symplectic fibrations over @xmath21 provide another natural source of stable hamiltonian structures .",
    "suppose @xmath67 is a locally trivial symplectic fibration whose standard fiber is a symplectic surface @xmath68 , possibly with boundary , and denote the coordinate on the base by  @xmath69 .",
    "the vertical subspaces form an integrable distribution @xmath45 , and any symplectic connection can be defined so that parallel transport is the flow of a vector field @xmath46 on @xmath4 with @xmath70 .",
    "there is then a unique @xmath20form @xmath47 on @xmath4 such that @xmath71 and @xmath72 , and we claim that @xmath73 is a stable hamiltonian structure on  @xmath4 .",
    "one only has to verify that @xmath47 is closed ; to see this , identify a neighborhood of any point in @xmath4 with @xmath74 via a symplectic local trivialization and denote the real coordinate by  @xmath69 .",
    "then @xmath46 can be written on @xmath74 in the form @xmath75 for some @xmath69dependent locally hamiltonian vector field @xmath76 on @xmath77 , and @xmath78 defines a @xmath20form on @xmath74 with @xmath79 .",
    "one can then check that @xmath47 has the form @xmath80 , which is closed because @xmath81 is a closed @xmath23form on @xmath77 for every  @xmath69 .",
    "an important special case of this construction is the mapping torus @xmath82 for a symplectomorphism @xmath83 : then the floer homology of @xmath84 can be viewed as a special case of symplectic field theory on @xmath85",
    ".    we shall now prove proposition  [ prop : shs ] by constructing a stable hamiltonian structure that combines both of the examples above .",
    "the resulting distribution @xmath8 will be a _ confoliation _",
    "@xcite ) , which means that the associated @xmath23form satisfies @xmath86 ; it is a contact structure wherever this inequality is strict , and is a symplectic fibration everywhere else .",
    "suppose @xmath24 is an abstract open book , and @xmath87 is its mapping torus , regarded as a fibration over @xmath21 , with the vertical distribution denoted by @xmath88 .",

    "we can assume without loss of generality that @xmath26 is the identity on  @xmath89 , so a neighborhood of each boundary component of @xmath28 now looks like @xmath94 with coordinates @xmath95 .",

    "the usual implicit function theorem in a banach manifold setting then implies that this moduli space is a smooth @xmath20manifold near @xmath16 , thus the @xmath20parameter family obtained in the proposition is unique up to changes of parametrization .",

    "since @xmath246 , @xmath235 is a complex line bundle , so the zeroes of its sections ( with prescribed asymptotic behavior ) can be counted and related to the same homotopy invariant quantities that figure into the index formula .",
    "notably , the integer @xmath247 , defined as a relative chern number with respect to certain special asymptotic trivializations ( cf .",

    "assume @xmath254 is a smooth family of almost complex structures such that @xmath255 for @xmath256 , @xmath257 for @xmath258 and @xmath259 in a neighborhood of @xmath260 . now define the moduli space @xmath261 let @xmath262 denote the connected component of @xmath263 containing @xmath264 , and for each @xmath265 define the subset @xmath266 .",
    "an argument by positivity of intersections as in @xcite shows that all curves @xmath267 are embedded , and no two curves in @xmath268 ( for fixed @xmath269 ) can intersect .",
    "moreover , they all have index  @xmath20 and genus zero , and have asymptotic orbits with exclusively _ odd _ conley - zehnder index .",
    "proposition  [ prop : ift ] now implies that each @xmath268 is a smooth @xmath20manifold and @xmath270 is a @xmath23manifold that locally foliates @xmath271 .",
    "it also follows that @xmath262 is a smooth @xmath0manifold .",
    "we claim that for @xmath258 sufficiently small , @xmath270 is diffeomorphic to @xmath21 and hits every point in @xmath271 . to see this , pick a loop @xmath272 that passes once transversely through the projection of every curve in @xmath251 .",
    "this defines an evaluation map @xmath273 which is a diffeomorphism .",
    "moreover since every curve in @xmath262 can be compactified to a surface with boundary in  @xmath7 , the algebraic intersection number of @xmath274 with @xmath275 is invariant , thus every curve in @xmath262 must intersect  @xmath275 , and the aforementioned positivity of intersections argument implies that for any given @xmath276 and @xmath277 , there is at most one element of @xmath270 with @xmath278 in its image .",
    "now for every @xmath279 , pick an open neighborhood @xmath280 sufficiently small so that all curves in @xmath281 hit @xmath275 transversely , exactly once .",
    "the evaluation map @xmath282 is therefore well defined , and writing the projection @xmath283 , the map @xmath284 has nonsingular derivative at @xmath285 , hence we can find an open neighborhood @xmath286 of @xmath287 and a number @xmath288 such that @xmath289 is in the image of @xmath281 under @xmath290 .",
    "the sets @xmath291 for all @xmath279 now form an open covering of the compact set @xmath275 , so we can pick finitely many curves @xmath292 such that @xmath293 , and set @xmath294 .",
    "now the image of @xmath295 under @xmath290 contains @xmath296 , hence for any @xmath297 and @xmath276 , there is a curve in @xmath270 passing transversely through @xmath275 at  @xmath278 .",
    "it follows that the evaluation map extends to @xmath270 as a diffeomorphism @xmath298 .",
    "finally , we observe from proposition  [ prop : ift ] that the set @xmath299 is open , and it is also closed since @xmath270 is compact , thus it is all of @xmath300 ."
