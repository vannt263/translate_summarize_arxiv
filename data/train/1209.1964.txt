    "in crystalline semiconductors , it often happens that the conduction band minima and valence band maxima are located at degenerate but inequivalent valleys .",
    "well - known examples include graphene ,  @xcite bismuth thin films ,  @xcite and alas quantum wells .",
    "@xcite since the valleys are usually separated by a large distance in momentum space , intervalley scattering is greatly suppressed in the presence of smooth scattering potential , rendering the valley index an intrinsic property for low - energy carriers . motivated by this observation , there has been a growing interest in exploiting the valley index in electronic devices , much in the same way as the spin index is used in spintronic applications .",
    "this is the subject of valleytronics .",
    "recently , a general scheme based on inversion symmetry breaking has been proposed to generate and manipulate the valley polarization .",
    "@xcite the central idea is that under inversion symmetry breaking , the valley index can be associated with distinctive physical quantities such as the berry curvature and orbital magnetic moment .",
    "@xcite using graphene as an example , the authors of ref",
    ".   showed that inversion symmetry breaking allows a valley hall effect in which carriers in different valleys flow to opposite transverse edges when an electric field is applied , leading to a finite valley polarization along the edges .",
    "@xcite furthermore , it also gives rise to valley - contrasting circular dichroism in the momentum space , which takes the extreme form of optical selection rules at high symmetry points .",
    "@xcite other approaches have also been proposed .",
    "@xcite however , they all rely on carefully prepared geometry at the atomic scale , which is difficult to control in experiments .    in general , inversion symmetry breaking also lifts the spin degeneracy of energy bands in the presence of spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) . as required by time - reversal symmetry ,",
    "the spin - splitting in opposite valleys must be opposite , therefore the valley carriers can be also distinguished by their spin moments .",
    "this is the basis of _ coupled _ spin and valley physics .",
    "however , the soc is negligibly small in graphene ,  @xcite preventing further investigation along this direction . in a recent work ,",
    "@xcite we have studied monolayers of group - vi transition - metal dichalcogenides for the following reasons : ( i ) the inversion symmetry is explicitly broken in monolayers ; ( ii ) the conduction and valence bands of these materials harbors a multi - valleyed structure ;  @xcite and ( iii ) the soc is substantial due to the presence of heavy metal atoms .",
    "@xcite therefore these materials provide a perfect platform to investigate the interplay between spin and valley degrees of freedom .",
    "based on an effective @xmath3 model , we predicted that the valley hall effect is accompanied by a spin hall effect in both @xmath4- and @xmath5-doped systems , and the valley - dependent optical selection rule also becomes spin - dependent .",
    "@xcite    monolayers of group - vi dichalcogenides also display excellent optical properties for practical applications .",
    "recent experiments have demonstrated that mos@xmath6 , a prototypical group - vi dichalcogenide , crossovers from an indirectgap semiconductor at multilayers to a direct band - gap one at monolayer .",
    "@xcite the direct band - gap is in the visible frequency range , most favorable for optoelectronic applications .",
    "experimental evidence of the valley - dependent optical selection rule in monolayer mos@xmath6 has been recently reported based on polarization - sensitive photoluminescence measurement .",
    "@xcite    in this work we present a comprehensive first - principles study of the coupled spin and valley physics , focusing on the hall effects of valley and spin .",
    "we show that , because of the inversion symmetry breaking and the strong soc , charge carriers in opposite valleys carry opposite berry curvature and spin moment , giving rise to both the valley- and spin - hall effect .",
    "our first - principles calculations provide a quantitative basis for the @xmath3 model derived in ref .  , and subtle differences between these",
    "two are discussed .",
    "we also show that the intrinsic spin hall conductivity in inversion - symmetric bulk dichalcogenides is an order of magnitude smaller compared to monolayers .",
    "our result demonstrates monolayer dichalcogenides as an ideal platform for the integration of valleytronics and spintronics .",
    "the electronic ground - state calculations in this work were performed using full - potential linearized augmented plane - wave method ,  @xcite implemented in the package wien2k .",
    "@xcite exchange - correlation effect was treated with the perdew , burke , and ernzerhof parameterized generalized - gradient approximation .",
    "@xcite the crystal structure were adopted from the first - principles optimized results .",
    "@xcite for the slab model , a 20   thick vacuum layer was used to avoid the interactions between adjacent monolayers .",
    "the converged ground - states were obtained using @xmath7-mesh @xmath8 for bulk and @xmath9 for monolayer in the first brillouin zone , both with @xmath10 , where @xmath11 represents the smallest muffin - tin radius and @xmath12 is the maximum size of reciprocal - lattice vectors .",
    "wave functions and potentials inside the atomic sphere were expanded in spherical harmonics up to @xmath13=10 and 4 , respectively .",
    "spin - orbit coupling was included by a second - variational procedure ,  @xcite where states up to 9 ry above fermi level were included in the basis expansion .    to calculate the berry curvature and hall conductivity , we first computed the wannier functions by the maximally localized algorithm ,  @xcite implemented in the package wannier90 .",
    "@xcite the construction of maximally localized wannier functions is a non - self - consistent process on a uniform @xmath14 grid of @xmath7-point with formerly converged self - consistent charge potential .",
    "transition - metal dichalcogenides have the chemical formula @xmath0 ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) .",
    "in the case of monolayers , there are 22 bands in the energy range from about -6 to 5 ev , mainly formed by @xmath15 @xmath16- and @xmath17 @xmath5-orbitals . with this in mind , we chose ten @xmath16 orbitals on atom @xmath15 and six @xmath5 orbitals on each atom @xmath17 as the initial guess of the wannier functions . after less than 200 iterative steps ,",

    "this shows the limitation of the @xmath3 method : it only captures the physics around the @xmath31 point , and first - principles study give us a more complete picture .",
    "we also note that there is a small spin splitting at the cbm for both ws@xmath6 and wse@xmath6 .",

    "finally we mention that here we only considered the intrinsic contribution to the spin hall effect , in which the spin hall current is driven by the berry curvature of the bloch bands .",
    "there are also extrinsic contributions coming from scattering of impurities and phonons .",
    "when the sample is hole - doped , the effect of phonon scattering on the shc should be weak because the phonon scattering will mostly contribute to intra - valley scattering , in which the spin @xmath99-component is nearly conserved due to the large spin - orbit splitting at the valence band top . on the other hand , impurity scattering can provide the large momentum transfer needed for the inter - valley scattering , and their effect on valley - dependent transport properties remains to be investigated .",
    "in summary , using the first - principles calculations , we have investigated the intrinsic spin hall effect in monolayers mos@xmath6 , mose@xmath6 , ws@xmath6 , as well as wse@xmath6 , driven by valley - contrasting berry curvature .",

    "<S> using first - principles calculations within density functional theory , we investigate the intrinsic spin hall effect in monolayers of group - vi transition - metal dichalcogenides @xmath0 ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 monolayers are direct band - gap semiconductors with two degenerate valleys located at the corners of the hexagonal brillouin zone . because of the inversion symmetry breaking and the strong spin - orbit coupling , charge carriers in opposite valleys carry opposite berry curvature and spin moment , giving rise to both a valley - hall and a spin - hall effect . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the intrinsic spin hall conductivity in inversion - symmetric bulk dichalcogenides is an order of magnitude smaller compared to monolayers . </S>",
    "<S> our result demonstrates monolayer dichalcogenides as an ideal platform for the integration of valleytronics and spintronics . </S>"
