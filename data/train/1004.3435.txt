    "quasicontinuum methods are a prototypical class of multiscale models that directly couple multiple modeling regions to reduce the computational complexity of modelling large atomistic systems .",
    "these methods are useful for computing the interaction of localized material defects such as crack tips or dislocations with long - range elastic fields of a crystalline material .",
    "the force - based quasicontinuum ( qcf ) method @xcite partitions the material into two disjoint regions , the atomistic region and the continuum region .",
    "it assigns forces to the degrees of freedom within each region using only the respective model , be it atomistic or continuum .",
    "this simplifies the formulation of the method as no special interaction rules are needed near the atomistic - continuum interface .",
    "the simplicity of mixing forces combined with the lack of spurious interface forces ( so - called `` ghost forces '' ) make the force - based method a popular approach , and this technique is widely applied in the multiscale literature  @xcite .",
    "a potential drawback of the qcf method is that it does not derive from an energy ( as it generally produces a non - conservative field ) . while the practical implications of this fact are still under investigation , it is already clear that the analysis of the qcf method poses formidable challenges .",
    "a series of recent articles has been devoted to its study  @xcite .",
    "for example , it was shown in @xcite that the linearized qcf operator is not positive definite , and that it is not uniformly stable ( in the number of atoms and the size of the atomistic region ) in discrete variants of most sobolev spaces .    however , numerical experiments in @xcite showed some unexpected spectral properties .",
    "conjecture 2 in @xcite states that the spectrum of @xmath0-eigenvalues of the linearized qcf operator is identical to that of the operator associated with the quasinonlocal qc method  @xcite .",
    "this is particularly surprising since the quasinonlocal qc method is energy - based , and thus indicates that the qcf operator is diagonalizable and that its spectrum is real . conjecture 8 in @xcite states that the condition number of a matrix of eigenvectors of the qcf operator grows at most logarithmically .",
    "this is an important fact for understanding the solution of the qcf equilibrium equations by the gmres method .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to provide rigorous proofs for these numerical observations .",
    "we define the qcf method and introduce the necessary notation in section [ sec : prelims ] . in section [ sec : n2 ]",
    "we establish all results for the case of next - nearest neighbour interactions as in the numerical experiments in @xcite .",
    "then , in section [ sec : fr ] we extend the results to the more technical case of finite - range interactions . in the case of finite - range interactions we can not make the comparison between the spectra of the qcf and qnl operators .",
    "instead , we prove that the spectrum of the qcf operator lies between the spectrum of the atomistic operator and the spectrum of the continuum operator ( theorem [ th : fr : evals ] ) .",
    "we note , moreover , that we were able to construct a matrix of eigenvectors for the qcf operator whose condition number is bounded uniformly in the number of atoms and the size of the atomistic region .",
    "this result is in fact stronger than the conjectures made in @xcite .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : prec ] , we analyze variants of preconditioned qcf operators to obtain rigorous convergence rates for preconditioned gmres methods as well as a new stability estimate .",
    "for the sake of brevity , we will keep the introduction to the atomistic model and the various flavours of quasicontinuum approximations to an absolute minimum . we refer to  @xcite for detailed discussions .",
    "note , in particular , that we have left out the usual rescaling factor @xmath1 .",
    "this reduces the complexity of the notation and is justified since in this paper we are primarily concerned with algebraic aspects of quasicontinuum operators .      in this section ,",
    "we summarize the notation and certain elementary results for some standard finite difference operators with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we identify @xmath2 with periodic infinite sequences as follows : @xmath3 the @xmath0-inner product on @xmath4 , and its associated norm , are defined as @xmath5 we will frequently use a subspace @xmath6 of mean zero functions , @xmath7 where @xmath8 .    the orthogonal projection onto @xmath9 is denoted @xmath10 , @xmath11 or , in matrix notation , @xmath12      the difference operator @xmath13 is defined by @xmath14 we note that @xmath15 and @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the range and @xmath18 denotes the kernel of an operator .",
    "we also remark that , here and throughout , unless specifically stated otherwise , we will not distinguish between an operator and its associated matrix representation in @xmath19 .",
    "the second generic operator that we will encounter is the negative laplace operator @xmath20 , @xmath21 as for the difference operator , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "using summation by parts , we obtain @xmath24 which implies that @xmath25 and hence @xmath26 .",
    "since @xmath27 , we have the identities @xmath28 we also note that @xmath29 , and that this bound is attained for even @xmath30 , as well as in the limit @xmath31 .",
    "since @xmath32 is singular , we also define the modified negative laplace operator @xmath33 so that @xmath34 if @xmath35 and @xmath36 this operator is invertible and satisfies @xmath37      the translation operator @xmath38 is defined by @xmath39 @xmath40 is an orthogonal operator , i.e. , @xmath41 and its eigenbasis can be written explicitly as @xmath42 the eigenvalues of @xmath40 are located on the unit circle @xmath43 and , in the limit @xmath44 , are dense in @xmath45 .",
    "we remark that we can write the difference operator @xmath46 and the negative laplace operator as laurent polynomials in @xmath40 : @xmath47 and @xmath48 where @xmath49 in general , if @xmath50 is a polynomial , then the spectrum of the operator @xmath51 is @xmath52 , and the eigenvectors are the same as for @xmath40 . since @xmath40 is a normal operator , all polynomials @xmath51 are also normal .",
    "finally , we note that @xmath53 , which implies that @xmath40 or any polynomial of @xmath40 commutes with @xmath54 .",
    "in particular , this implies that all polynomials in @xmath40 ( e.g. , @xmath32 , @xmath46 ) and the operators @xmath55 and @xmath56 commute .",
    "we consider an atomistic model problem with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we let @xmath9 be the set of admissible displacements of an @xmath30-periodic chain : the set of all @xmath30-periodic displacements with mean zero .",
    "the latter condition is necessary to ensure that the systems of equations that we consider are well posed .",
    "if @xmath57 is a fixed _ macroscopic strain _ , then the energy ( per period ) of the atomistic chain subject to a displacement @xmath58 is given by @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a pair interaction potential , for example , a lennard  jones or morse potential , and @xmath61 , @xmath62 , can be thought of as a discrete cutoff radius .",
    "( note that , even though we have defined @xmath63 for all @xmath64 , only @xmath65 are admitted in the solution of the minimization problem . )",

    "extensions to further neighbours exist  @xcite , but we only use the version up to second neighbours in this paper .",
