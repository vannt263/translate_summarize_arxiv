    "since a pioneer paper by ginzburg on the coexistence of ferromagnetism and superconductivity @xcite , the interplay between these two long - range orderings has been an interesting topic in solid - state physics .",
    "superconductivity and magnetism would be antagonistic because of the competitive nature between the superconducting screening ( meissner effect ) and the internal fields generated by magnetic orderings . during the last three decades ,",
    "however , the discovery of a number of magnetic superconductors has allowed for a better understanding of how magnetic order and superconductivity can coexist .",
    "it seems to be generally accepted that antiferromagnetism with local moments coming from rare - earth elements readily coexists with type ii superconductivity .",
    "this is because superconductivity and magnetism are carried by different types of electrons ; magnetism is connected with deeply seated 4__f _ _ electrons , while superconductivity is fundamentally related to the outermost electrons such as _ s _ , _ p _ , and _",
    "d _ electrons .    in the case of a ferromagnetic superconductor ,",
    "a trickier negotiation is needed for the coexistence , because internal fields are not canceled out in the range of a superconducting coherence length in contrast with an antiferromagnetic superconductor . in the classical magnetic superconductor errh@xmath4b@xmath4 with a superconducting transition temperature 8.7 k , for example , once the er sublattice starts to order ferromagnetically below about 0.8 k , the superconductivity is immediately destroyed , except a very narrow coexistence region near 0.8 k @xcite . here",
    "we note that the magnetic structure coexisting with the superconductivity is not purely ferromagnetic but spacially modulated .",
    "erni@xmath1b@xmath1c is a modern example of magnetic superconductor .",
    "a microscopic coexistence between weak ferromagnetism and superconductivity was reported , but detailed neutron diffraction investigations indicated that the magnetism coexisting with the superconductivity is not purely ferromagnetic @xcite , again .",
    "these examples seem to indicate that superconductivity hardly coexists with ferromagnetism , even though superconductivity and ferromagnetism are carried by different types of electrons .",
    "recently , saxena _ et al .",
    "_  discovered a new type of ferromagnetic superconductor uge@xmath1  in which superconductivity occurs at high pressures @xcite .",
    "it is particularly interesting to note that both of ferromagnetism and superconductivity may be carried by itinerant @xmath5 electrons , which can be homogeneously spread in the real space , although it is still a matter of debate and remains to be resolved .",
    "this observation has renewed our interest on the interplay of ferromagnetism and superconductivity .",
    "figure [ fig : diagram ] shows a temperature ( @xmath0 ) vs pressure ( @xmath2 ) phase diagram of uge@xmath1 .",
    "a curie temperature ( @xmath6 ) is about 52 k at ambient pressure , and monotonically decreases with increasing pressure .",
    "then it collapses to zero temperature at a ferromagnetic critical pressure @xmath7  ( @xmath8 1.5 gpa ) . in the ferromagnetic phase , another phase transition or crossover",
    "seem to appear at @xmath9  ( @xmath10 32 k at ambient pressure ) .",
    "this characteristic temperature @xmath9  also decreases with increasing pressure and becomes suppressed to zero at a critical pressure @xmath11  ( @xmath8 1.2 gpa ) .",
    "the transitions at @xmath11  and @xmath7  are likely of the first order in nature @xcite .",
    "superconductivity emerges in the pressure range between @xmath8 1.0 and @xmath8 1.5 gpa . since a maximum superconducting transition temperature ( @xmath12  @xmath8 0.7 k ) is observed at around @xmath11  @xcite , we speculate that the critical point @xmath11  plays an important role in the onset of the superconductivity ( see , for example , watanabe and miyake @xcite , sandeman _",
    "_  @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "very recently , nakane _ et al .",
    "_  provided a supporting evidence for the speculation by means of ac magnetic susceptibility measurements under external magnetic fields @xmath13 ; in a plot of @xmath12  as functions of @xmath2 and @xmath13 , the superconductivity always appears at around the critical point @xmath11 , not around @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "however , there are still many unsolved questions in this unique material to be further clarified . to shed more light on the nature of the ferromagnetism as well as its pressure variation , we present in this paper the @xmath0-dependence of the uniform magnetization under pressure by the neutron diffraction technique , together with the dc magnetization method .",
    "similar measurements were already reported , however the present experiment is so precise that we can analyze the functional dependence of the magnetization .",
    "actually , we have found that the low @xmath0-dependence of the uniform magnetization can be described by a conventional stoner model .",
    "this enables us to extract new information about the ferromagnetism as follows : the low-@xmath0 and low-@xmath2 region of the ferromagnetic state , i.e. , the fm1 region in fig .  1 ,",
    "is understood as a perfectly polarized state in which only a majority spin band is occupied .",
    "as the pressure increases toward @xmath11 , a stoner gap @xmath3 in the heavy quasiparticle bands decreases monotonically , similarly to @xmath9@xmath14 .",
    "when the pressure exceeds @xmath11 , the gap seems to jump up , although the applicability of the stoner model to this high pressure ferromagnetic state ( fm2 ) is less convincing compared to the region @xmath15 @xmath11 . from these results",

    "it is interesting to note that these quantities seem to lie on a single line , suggesting that the characteristic energy scale of unknown origin , @xmath9 , is related to the stoner gap @xmath26 ( equivalently @xmath28 ) .    in fig .",

    "this coincidence justifies our interpretation based on the stoner model .",

    "we observed that the @xmath41 curve shows a step - like increase at lower fields similarly to the @xmath20 curve , and that @xmath9  exhibits an increase with @xmath42 in accordance with the previous results @xcite .",
    "we find that the static low-@xmath0 magnetization can also be well described by the stoner model ( see dotted lines ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : field ] ( b ) we plot @xmath26 as a function of @xmath42 , which was obtained in the same manner as above .",
    "it is found that @xmath26 increases almost linearly with @xmath42 , as shown by a broken line .",
    "this is highly expected from the stoner model ; the gap in the quasiparticle bands should linearly increase with the magnetic field due to the zeeman effect as follows ,    @xmath43    here , @xmath26 is a value at zero magnetic field , i.e. , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 denote a @xmath45-factor and the magnitude of the quasiparticle spin , respectively , and @xmath47 is the bohr magneton .",
    "indeed , the value of @xmath26 @xmath10 12 k estimated from the extrapolation to zero field is consistent with a value obtained from the bragg peak intensity ( at @xmath13 = 0 ) mentioned above .",
    "a set of parameters , @xmath45 = 6/7 and @xmath46 = 5/2 corresponding to an _",

    "it is very interesting to note that this value is almost the same as the slope of curves in a plot of @xmath9  vs @xmath13 ( see , for example , ref.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this clearly supports that @xmath9  is related to the stoner gap @xmath48 , as mentioned above .",

    "again , we find the same relation @xmath39 with the same scale factor @xmath40 as the above .",
    "note that there is no adjustable parameter at all , nevertheless we find the good agreement between @xmath51 estimated from the stoner model and deduced from the heat capacity experiments .",
    "this clearly proves the validity of our model analysis .",
    "let us return to the pressure region of @xmath52 @xmath11 . as may be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : bragg ] , the accordance between the calculated and the experimental results is less convincing compared with that for @xmath15 @xmath11 , for which there are two possible explanations : first , the low @xmath0-dependence of the uniform magnetization ( for @xmath52 @xmath11 ) can no longer be described by the stoner model .",
    "second , the stoner model is still applicable to the fm2 region , but a pressure distribution within the sample will cause the @xmath41 curve to deviate from the stoner model .",
    "( the curie temperature decreases steeply above @xmath11  ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "in such a case , the experimetal results could be obscured by even a small pressure distribution within the sample  @xcite . )",
    "since it is unclear which is dominant , we tentatively tried to apply the stoner model to the fm2 region .",
    "the obtained @xmath48-values are as follows ; @xmath48 = 40 ( @xmath53 6 ) , 25 ( @xmath53 5 ) , and 7 ( @xmath53 7 ) k at @xmath2 = 1.23 , 1.28 , and 1.40 gpa , respectively .",
    "we find that @xmath48 shows a jump near at @xmath11  on going from the fm1 to fm2 region , and that @xmath48 decreases monotonically with further increasing pressure and finally tends toward zero in the vicinity of the ferromagnetic critical pressure @xmath7 .",
    "note that the jump of @xmath48 reflects the sudden change in the solpe of the @xmath20 curves below and above @xmath11 .",
    "a further investigation is needed to clarify whether the magnetization in the fm2 region can be described by the stoner model or not .",
    "finally we discuss the correlation between the ferromagnetism in the fm1 region and the superconductivity .",
    "it is evident that the stoner gap behavior in the fm1 region is firmly established by the consistency check , i.e. , the comparison of our results with the @xmath49-coefficients .",
    "using the parameter @xmath28 in eq .",
    "( 2 ) obtained from the fitting , we can estimate an effective internal field @xmath54 seen by the itinerant electrons due to the ferromagnetism by the definition of @xmath55",
    ". then we find it to be very large ; for example , @xmath54 @xmath56 100 t at ambient pressure and @xmath54 @xmath8 40 t at 1.1 gpa ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for detail ) .",
    "this may explain an asymmetric shape of the superconducting dome with respect to @xmath11  in the @xmath0-@xmath2 phase diagram , if we assume that the superconductivity does not survive under such a strong internal field .",
    "in the literature , it has been speculated that the nonunitary superconducting state would be realized in uge@xmath1 ; otherwise the superconductivity would not coexist with the feromagnetism .",
    "however , it seems very unlikely that the strong internal field mentioned above dose not kill the superconductivity , even if the spin - triplet pairing state would be formed .",
    "this leads us to suggest spatially inhomogeneous coexistence of the ferromagnetism and the superconductivity , provided that the superconductivity below @xmath11  is intrinsic , but not due to the pressure inhomogeneity .",
    "we need a further experiment to confirm this possibility .",
    "we investigated the uniform magnetization of the pressure - induced superconductor uge@xmath1  by the neutron diffraction technique together with the dc magnetization measurements under pressure . for this strongly anisotropic ferromagnet",
    ", we found that the low-@xmath0 behavior in the magnetization of the fm1 region can be explained by the conventional stoner model .",
    "our analysis based on the stoner model produces the following results : the ferromagnetic state below the critical pressure @xmath11  ( @xmath8 1.2 gpa ) is understood as the perfectly polarized state in which the heavy quasiparticles occupy only the majority spin band .",
    "the stoner gap @xmath48 in the heavy quasiparticle bands was estimated to be about 40 k at ambient pressure , and @xmath48 was found to decrease monotonically with increasing pressure @xmath2 and to increase linearly with magnetic field @xmath13 .",
    "the similarity between the @xmath2- and @xmath13-dependences of @xmath48 and @xmath9  suggests that the characteristic energy @xmath9  of unknown origin can be related to the stoner gap . assuming that the product @xmath38(@xmath27 ) is constant , we evaluated the @xmath2- and @xmath13-dependence of a density of states at the fermi energy @xmath37(@xmath27 ) using the stoner model .",
    "then we found that @xmath37(@xmath27 ) = @xmath40@xmath49 with the same constant @xmath40 for both the @xmath2- and @xmath13-dependence of the electronic specific heat coefficient @xmath33 .",
    "this justifies our interpretation based on the stoner model .",
    "finally we argued the relationship between ferromagnetism and superconductivity ; the effective internal field seen by itinerant electrons is estimated to be sufficiently strong that the superconductivity would hardly survive , which leads us to suggest the spatially inhomogeneous coexistence of ferromagnetism and superconductivity .",
    "we hope that these results stimulate further theoretical investigations .",
