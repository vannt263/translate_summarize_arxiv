    "let @xmath0 be the cone of positive harmonic functions in the unit disc @xmath1 of the complex plane . if @xmath2 the classical harnack s inequality tells that @xmath3 for any @xmath4 .",
    "recall that the hyperbolic distance @xmath5 between two points @xmath6 is @xmath7 hence , estimates above can be read as @xmath8 .",
    "since these notions are preserved by automorphisms of the disc , we deduce latexmath:[\\[\\label{1.1 }    @xmath6 .",
    "so for any function @xmath2 , a sequence of points @xmath10 and the corresponding sequence of values @xmath11 , @xmath12 are linked by @xmath13 , @xmath14 however , given a sequence of points @xmath10 , one can not expect to interpolate by a function in @xmath15 any sequence of positive values @xmath16 satisfying the above compatibility condition unless the sequence @xmath17 reduces to two points .",
    "actually it is well known that having equality in ( [ 1.1 ] ) for two distinct points @xmath6 forces the function @xmath18 to be a poisson kernel and hence one can not expect to interpolate further values . in other words , the natural trace space given by harnack s lemma  ( [ 1.1 ] ) is too large and one may consider the following notion .    a sequence of points @xmath17 in the unit disc will be called an interpolating sequence for @xmath15 if there exists a constant @xmath19 , such that for any sequence of positive values @xmath16 satisfying @xmath20 there exists a function @xmath2 with @xmath21 , @xmath12    observe that this is a conformally invariant notion , that is , if @xmath17 is an interpolating sequence for @xmath15 , so is @xmath22 , for any automorphism @xmath23 of the unit disc .",
    "moreover the corresponding constants satisfy @xmath24 .",
    "recall that a sequence of points @xmath17 in the unit disc is called separated if @xmath25 .",
    "the main result of this paper is the following .",
    "[ thm1 ] a separated sequence @xmath17 of points in the unit disc is interpolating for @xmath15 if and only if there exist constants @xmath26 and @xmath27 such that @xmath28 for any @xmath29    we have restricted attention to separated sequences because we want to consider an interpolation problem by positive harmonic functions and not by their derivatives .",
    "however it is worth mentioning that any interpolating sequence for @xmath15 is the union of at most three separated sequences .",
    "let us now discuss condition  ( [ 1.3 ] ) . as it is usual in this kind of problems , the geometrical description of interpolating sequences",
    "is given in terms of a density condition which tells , in the appropriate sense , that interpolating sequences are not too dense .",
    "the number  2 shows up in   ( [ 1.3 ] ) because of the normalization of the hyperbolic distance .",
    "we have chosen this normalization because it fits perfectly well with dyadic decompositions .",
    "as we will show in section  [ sectioncuatro ] , there are a number of conditions which are equivalent to  ( [ 1.3 ] ) .",
    "for instance , a sequence @xmath17 satisfies  ( [ 1.3 ] ) if and only if there exist constants @xmath30 and @xmath27 such that latexmath:[\\[\\ # \\left \\ { z_j \\colon\\left | \\frac{z_j - z_n}{1-\\bar z_nz_j}\\right    @xmath12 and @xmath32 .",
    "one can also write an equivalent condition in terms of carleson measures .",
    "it will be shown in section  [ sectioncuatro ] that a sequence @xmath10 satisfies ( [ 1.3 ] ) if and only if there exist constants @xmath33 and @xmath27 such that @xmath34 where the sum is taken over all points @xmath35 such that @xmath36 .",
    "this resembles the usual carleson condition with an exponent @xmath37 for the carleson squares which contain a point of the sequence in its top part .",
    "let us now discuss the geometrical meaning of condition  ( [ 1.3 ] ) .",
    "it tells that , when viewed from a point of the sequence , sequences satisfying ( [ 1.3 ] ) are at large scales exponentially more sparse than merely separated sequences . actually , a sequence of points @xmath38 is a finite union of separated sequences if and only if ( [ 1.3 ] ) holds with @xmath39 .",
    "it should also be mentioned that in condition ( [ 1.3 ] ) one counts points in the sequence which are at hyperbolic distance less than @xmath40 from a given point @xmath41 in the sequence , instead of taking as a base point any @xmath42 as in @xcite .",
    "see also [ s ,  p.6377 ] .",
    "this last condition is stronger .",
    "actually it will be shown in section  [ sectioncuatro ] that there exist two separated interpolating sequences @xmath43 for @xmath15 with @xmath44 such that @xmath45 is not an interpolating sequence for @xmath15 .",
    "let us now explain the main ideas of the proof .",
    "let @xmath46 denote the radial projection of a set @xmath47 , that is , @xmath48 for some @xmath49 .",
    "an application of hall s lemma yields that there exists a universal constant @xmath50 such that for any @xmath2 one has @xmath51 the necessity of condition ( [ 1.3 ] ) follows easily from this estimate .",
    "the proof of the sufficiency is harder . given a sequence of points @xmath10 satisfying ( [ 1.3 ] ) and a sequence of positive values @xmath16 satisfying the compatibility condition ( [ 1.2 ] ) , one has to find a function @xmath2 such that @xmath21 , @xmath12 the construction of the function @xmath2 may be splitted into three steps .",
    "we will apply a classical result in convex analysis called farkas lemma which may be understood as an analogue for cones of the hahn - banach theorem . instead of constructing directly the function @xmath2 which performs the interpolation , farkas lemma will tell that it suffices to prove the following statement .",
    "given any partition of the sequence @xmath17 into two disjoint subsequences , @xmath52 , there exists a function @xmath53 such that @xmath54    \\2 .",
    "let @xmath55 denote the harmonic measure in @xmath1 of the set @xmath56 from the point @xmath4 , that is , @xmath57 we will construct a set @xmath58 @xmath59 and we will show that condition ( [ 1.3 ] ) provides some sort of independence of harmonic measures @xmath60 . actually , given @xmath61 , there exists @xmath62 and a collection of pairwise disjoint subsets @xmath63 of @xmath64 such that @xmath65 here @xmath66 denotes the set of indexes @xmath67 so that @xmath68 .",
