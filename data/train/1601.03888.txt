    "chirality ( handedness ) occurs in systems which are distinguishable from their mirror image , that is , systems which lack reflection symmetry .",
    "both matter and light can display chirality , and the chirality of certain molecules leads to a difference in the absorption of left and right circularly polarized light and therefore exhibit circular dichroism ( cd ) and optical rotation dichroism ( ord ) .",
    "cd and ord are not independent , as they are linked by kramers  kronig relations  @xcite . linear cd and ord spectroscopy have been used extensively to determine more accurately the structure of proteins  @xcite and the excitonic states in photosynthetic antennae including the fenna - matthews - olson complex ( fmo ) from green sulfur bacteria  @xcite , and light harvesting complex i  @xcite and ii  @xcite .",
    "transient circular dichroism ( trcd ) , that is , the time - domain cd spectra of a system away from equilibrium , has been used within the infra - red  @xcite and ultra - violet frequency ranges  @xcite .",
    "this technique has proved useful in measuring protein conformation and lipid structure  @xcite .    in the optical regime , however , trcd has been developed very little and there is a less comprehensive understanding of what signals should be expected .",
    "while some investigations of the relations between photoexcitation dynamics and chiral response have been carried out using pump - probe configurations  @xcite and , more recently , two - dimensional ( 2d ) spectroscopy configurations  @xcite , the full potential of time - resolved cd is yet to be explored .",
    "the reluctance to use this technique originates from the lower signal to noise ratios ; typically cd signals are 3 to 4 orders of magnitude weaker compared to non - chiral origin signals  @xcite .",
    "quantum transitions between electronic states of matter due to the interaction with light can be understood within a multipole expansion : electric dipoles give the most significant ( lowest order ) contribution , but give the same absorption for left and right circularly polarized light .",
    "the next most significant terms are magnetic dipole and electric quadrapole terms , which are typically weaker by a factor proportional to the chromophore size divided by an optical wavelength  @xcite . the combination of these higher order moments and an electric dipole moment results in a difference in left - right absorption and hence cd .",
    "systems of multiple chromophores such as photosynthetic pigment - protein complexes may show circular dichroism even when individual choromophores do not .",
    "the origin of chirality here is both the electronic interactions between chromophores and the lack of reflection symmetry in the transition dipole moments of each chromophore and the vectors describing the relative displacements and orientation between them  @xcite . in the absence of electronic coupling",
    "there will be no cd and if all the relative displacement vectors lie in a plane , the system is no longer chiral and will not exhibit cd either",
    ". therefore cd signals from such systems show a strong dependence on excited state delocalization and on the relative positions and orientations between individual dipole moments  @xcite .",
    "this indicates that trcd can probe dynamic exciton localization  @xcite as well as the sensitivity of electronic transitions to structural changes following photoexcitation  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , transitions to states which have negligible electric dipole moments ( and are thus `` dark '' to non - chiral spectroscopy ) , can potentially have magnetic dipole transitions which can be of comparable order to bright states within the complex and therefore be directly probed via trcd . while it may be possible to infer the dynamics related to a dark state from the ground state dynamics or transitions to double excited states  @xcite",
    "it is not possible to directly detect signals relating to coherences between the dark state and other `` bright '' states ( as this term would vanish by definition ) without observing the chiral signals .    in the context of photosynthetic excitons in light - harvesting antennae",
    "a current problem under scrutiny is to probe quantum coherences among exciton states @xcite . in these systems",
    "the comparable strength of interactions between site electronic excitations and the coupling to a structured vibrational background lead to a complex exciton and vibrational dynamics that has been incisively investigated in the last decade by 2d optical spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "these experiments have revealed pico - second coherence beating in a variety of photosynthetic complexes @xcite and chemical systems @xcite generating an intense debate about the electronic and vibrational origin of such signals .",
    "there is mounting theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite evidence that coupling to some well resolved vibrational modes may indeed enable quantum coherent dynamics of excitons through vibronic coupling .",
    "notwithstanding , coherence beating in 2d spectroscopy signals is influenced by both excited state and ground state vibrational coherences @xcite .",
    "there is therefore a need for experimental approaches that can isolated coherence specific signals in the excited state with minimal or no contribution of the ground states vibrational coherences .",
    "this is a quite challenging problem as in the majority of the experimental conditions one would expect such contributions and therefore the experimental scenarios for achieving isolation of excited state coherences seem to be system specific @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present a theoretical description of trcd in excitonic systems and show that chiral time - resolved experiments in pump - probe configurations and in the impulsive limit could be potentially used to probe excited state coherences .",
    "we develop a doorway window formalism to analyse the chiral and non - chiral contributions to the signal and discuss the conditions under which ground state coherences have negligible influence in the chiral doorway functions .",
    "we illustrate the technique by presenting numerical results for a dimer exciton system , which shows signatures of vibronic dynamics .    the paper is organized as follows : sec .",

    "transition frequencies to double excited states are furthermore shifted by @xmath25 , which for simplicity will be set to zero .",
    "the electronic excitation dynamics under the influence of the vibrational environment will be exactly computed via a hierarchy of equations of motion ( heom )  @xcite .",

    "such signals can have two origins .",
    "the first is from the intrinsic chirality ( due to the lack of reflection symmetry ) in the chromophores themselves , giving transitions a finite magnetic - dipole and/or electric quadrapole moment .",
    "we do not consider this case explicitly in this work , although we briefly discuss how the effects can be included within this formalism without significantly changing our key results .",
    "the second originates from the combination of the spatial separation and orientation of the chromophores and their dipole moments within a molecular complex , or multichromophore system , and the position dependence of the phase of the laser . treating the light as a classical field , the time dependent interaction hamiltonian between the light and the @xmath32th molecular complex in our sample reads  @xcite @xmath33 with @xmath34 the transverse component of the electric field and @xmath35 the polarization operator for the @xmath32 complex . in eq .",

    "we will neglect this dependence ( i.e.  make the condon approximation  @xcite ) and take @xmath38 .",

    "this is different to techniques such as 2d fourier transform optical spectroscopy and ordinary pump - probe , in which the ground state contribution can conceal excited state coherences .    by systematically changing the pulse width and carrier frequency , it would be possible to eliminate the participation of coherences between states with energy differences larger than the pulses frequency width , or which are out of resonance . this spectroscopy technique can therefore help to isolate and characterize coherences which have been predicted from theory or other experiments using different techniques .",
