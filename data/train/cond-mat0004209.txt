    "therefore , these systems are ideal objects to study interaction effects such as transitions in the ground - state spin configuration as a function of the magnetic field",
    ".    starting from quantum dots as a structure which is well understood by now , more complex systems are conceivable and likely to have perspective in future applications @xcite@xmath1@xcite@xmath1@xcite .",
    "a simple example is analogous to a two - atom molecule consisting of two coupled quantum dots .",
    "the more principal properties of coupled quantum dots follow from the simple model of e.g.  two disk - like dots side by side in a plane or on top of each other ( lateral or vertical quantum - dot molecules ( qdms ) ) , respectively , which are the subject of experimental@xcite@xmath1@xcite@xmath1@xcite and theoretical@xcite@xmath1@xcite@xmath1@xcite@xmath2@xcite studies .",
    "tunneling and overlap of orbital wavefunctions lead to bonding and antibonding states with defined parity , which are delocalized over the two - dot system as in natural systems .",
    "the advantage of qdms is the tunability of the electron number and of the coupling strength by proper design .",
    "the latter allows to investigate the transition between weak and strong coupling .",
    "the increased interest in coupled quantum dots is indicated by a growing number of papers on this topic : austing _ et al._@xcite measured addition spectra of vertical qdm in different coupling regimes .",

    "we investigate the electronic structure of the ground state of two laterally coupled ( identical ) quantum dots as a function of the interdot distance . in our calculations , applying sdft , we focus on spin - dependent effects in few - electron quantum dot molecules containing 2 , 4 , and 8 electrons . in the case of 4 ( 8) electrons",
    "we find a change of spin configuration with decreasing coupling strength from @xmath3 ( @xmath3 ) to @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) . for 2 electrons sdft yields a transition from spin singlet to spin triplet .",
    "it turns out , however , that the latter result is an artifact of the sdft , as can be shown ( at least for our choice of the confinement potential ) by using alternative approaches .",
    "furthermore , we show the characteristic coulomb staircases for the chemical potential in the weak and strong coupling limits , respectively .    for all our calculations@xcite",
    "we assume that the two dots are coupled in a quantum - mechanically coherent way .",
    "this means we use delocalized electron states extended over the whole quantum dot molecule whereas states localized to the left or right dot do not exist in this description .",
    "note , that this model does not contain all aspects of the actual physical situation where an electron occupying a covalent state interacts with other electrons and charges in the surrounding semiconductor material .",
    "these interactions may cause a dephasing of the quantum mechanical wavefunction leading to a breakdown of the delocalized state@xcite . up to now",
    "no theory is available which allows a reliable approximation for dephasing rates in realistic nanostructures .",
    "the outline of this paper is the following : in the next section we describe our model of the qdm and discuss the single - particle spectrum of the non - interacting system . in sec .",

    "finally we show the typical coulomb staircase of the addition energies for the weak and the strong coupling limits , respectively .",
    "we consider quantum dots prepared by laterally confining two - dimensional electrons in a gaas / algaas heterostructure ( material parameters of gaas : @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) . as",
    "the lateral confinement is much weaker than that in growth direction ( @xmath8-direction ) we adopt the standard situation of the electronic quantum limit and describe the electron density by @xmath9 .",

    "our choice of the external confinement potential @xmath14 is @xmath15 where the coupling strength depends on the distance @xmath16 between the potential minima at @xmath17 in the @xmath13-plane ( fig .  1 ) .",

    "@xmath24 we obtain the same spectrum , now twofold because the system consists of two identical but completely separated quantum dots . by switching on the coupling ( or lowering @xmath24 starting from the weak - coupling limit )",
    "we recover the anticipated properties of a diatomic molecule : the energies decrease ( increase ) with respect to the reference level due to formation of bonding ( antibonding ) states , which have even ( odd ) parity as indicated by solid ( dashed ) lines .",

    "due to the closed shell for 2 electrons the ground state is not spin - polarized .",

    "this result , similar to that obtained e.g. by nagaraja _",
    "et al._@xcite , differs from those of the physically analogous problems of the vertical qdms@xcite@xmath1@xcite and from the hydrogen molecule whose ground states are spin singlets .",
    "the sdft result is also in contrast to a mathematical theorem stating that the spin configuration of the ground state of a two - electron quantum dot molecule , with our definition of the external confinement potential , should be a spin singlet state : as the total hamiltonian @xmath54 , eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) , does not depend on spin coordinates we can focus on the spatial wavefunctions .",
    "due to theorem xiii.47 of ref .",
    "the ( spatial ) ground state wavefunction of the considered two - body - problem is positive and nondegenerate , this means it is symmetric in the spatial coordinates . as a consequence of pauli s principle the ground state has to be a spin singlet state .    in view of this rigorous statement ,",
    "the sdft results of fig .",
    "[ ksqdm2 ] for @xmath65 @xmath62 can not be considered as true ground state values ( the same holds for the corresponding sdft densities ) .",
    "we test this finding by using a perturbation approach analogous to the heitler - london model for the hydrogen molecule , which in contrast to sdft has the advantage of yielding an upper limit for the ground state energy .",
    "similar calculations for other shapes of the external potential were done in ref .  .",
    "for the two - electron qdm we rewrite the total hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) as @xmath66 with @xmath67 the ground - state wavefunctions of the shifted harmonic oscillators @xmath68 are denoted by @xmath69 .",
    "so we can use the typical heitler - london ansatz for the ( unnormalized ) singlet @xmath70 and triplet @xmath71 spatial wavefunctions @xmath72 to calculate the expectation value of the ground - state energy of the system @xmath73 note that all matrix elements are real quantities .",

    "the result for the matrix elements is @xmath75 @xmath76 @xmath77 @xmath78 with the modified bessel s function @xmath79 and the error function @xmath80 @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ heitler ] we compare the ground - state energies resulting from sdft calculations with the heitler - london approach . for @xmath81 @xmath62 the sdft singlet ground - state energies are lower than the hl energies .",
    "as the comparison between sdft and exact diagonalization for 2-electron quantum dots shows good agreement@xcite , we expect this to hold also for the qdm with small @xmath24 .",
    "moreover , the hl triplet energy diverges for @xmath82 and becomes larger than the hl singlet energy .",
    "therefore , we regard the sdft results for small @xmath24 as a better approximation of the ground state than the hl results@xcite .    if , however , @xmath24 is increased beyond @xmath83 @xmath62 the hl energies become lower than the sdft results and replace them as ground - state energies .",
    "it can be shown analytically that for sufficiently large @xmath24 the hl energies fulfill the relation @xmath84 .",
    "thus , in the limit @xmath20 the hl results are consistent with the mathematical theorem quoted above .",
    "in addition , in the weak - coupling limit the interaction is reduced to the classical coulomb repulsion between point charges and the total energy approaches asymptotically @xmath85 .",
    "this is also consistent with the energies of the hl approach .",
    "the energy difference of @xmath86 @xmath23 between @xmath87 and @xmath88 in the weak - coupling limit can be ascribed to the self - interaction within the sdft scheme : the charge density of a weakly coupled quantum dot molecule is mainly localized in its centers ( charge 1 @xmath89 per center ) .",
    "however , within the sdft formalism the energy of each charge in its own coulomb field is counted additionally leading to an enhanced total energy@xcite . to illustrate this ,",
    "let us to apply the sdft concept to a single - particle problem .",
    "for a circular parabolic quantum dot with @xmath22 @xmath23 this gives a ground - state energy of @xmath90 @xmath23 , i.e.  the self - interaction error is @xmath91 @xmath92 .",
    "this value has to be doubled for the @xmath20 limit of the qdm .",
    "thus , we identify the difference @xmath93 as the self - interaction energy in this limit .",
    "the energy difference between the singlet state and the triplet state in the sdft approach can be qualitatively explained as an xc effect : both spin configurations show similar total electron densities .",
    "consequently the contributions from the hartree energy and the spin - independent xc energy can be taken to be approximately equal for singlet and triplet states . however , the triplet total energy is in addition lowered by spin - dependent xc effects leading to the energy difference in fig .",
    "[ heitler ] .    to summarize this section : for small @xmath24 ( @xmath94 @xmath62 )",
    "we find the sdft ( singlet ) energies to be the better approximation to the ground state than the hl results , while for larger @xmath24 ( @xmath65 @xmath62 ) the sdft energies become too large due to the self - interaction error and the hl results provide the better approximation of the ground - state energy .",
    "in this section we present our results for the ground - state energy and spin - configuration for artificial molecules containing 4 and 8 electrons as a function of the interdot distance @xmath24 .",
    "our calculations show that a spin - polarized ground state is accompanied by a ( quasi-)degeneracy at the fermi level in the noninteracting single - particle spectrum whereas unpolarized ground states require a sufficiently large gap between the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied single - particle levels of the noninteracting spectrum .",
    "single dots with 4 electrons have a spin - polarized ground state ( @xmath3 ) due to hund s rule@xcite@xmath1@xcite .",
    "this is the case also for the qdm with @xmath19 ( fig .  5 ) .",
    "the spin - polarized ground state persists with increasing @xmath24 as long as the xc energy overcompensates the energy costs of putting electrons with parallel spins into the bonding and antibonding states ( ( b ) and ( c ) in fig .",
    "[ qdmnww ] ) evolving from the second level at @xmath19 . for @xmath95 @xmath62",
    "it becomes energetically more favorable to occupy both the bonding level ( a ) and antibonding level ( b ) ( fig .  [ qdmnww ] ) with two particles forming an @xmath4 ground state .",
    "this configuration remains stable even in the weak coupling limit and reflects the noninteracting particle picture ( fig .",
    "[ qdmnww ] ) which does not show level crossings at the fermi energy for @xmath96 and large @xmath24 .",
    "this result is in agreement with the work of nagaraja _ et al._@xcite ( laterally coupled dots ) , rontani _ et al._@xcite , and imamura",
    "_ et al._@xcite ( vertically coupled dots ) .",
    "on the other hand , nagaraja _",
    "et al._@xcite do not find a spin - polarized ground state in the strong coupling limit , because their confinement potential obtained by simulating external gates does not approach that of a circular parabolic dot as in our case .",
    "although even in the limit of large @xmath24 a quantum - mechanical coupling ( delocalized bonding and antibonding states ) between the dots can be observed within the sdft scheme the resulting density ( fig .",
    "[ qdm4_10n ] ) and energy ( fig .",
    "[ qdm4_e ] ) tend towards a semiclassical picture : the densities of the dots are well separated and the total energy of the two coupled dots consists of twice the ( quantum - mechanical ) energy of a single dot containing 2 electrons and the energy of classical repulsion of two point - like charges ( 2@xmath89 ) in the distance @xmath24 ( see inset of fig .  [ qdm4_e ] ) .",
    "in contrast to the 2-electron qdm , this test for the asymptotics of the total energy being fulfilled underlines the reliabilty of the sdft results for 4 electrons .    turning to qdms with 8 electrons ( fig .",
    "[ ksqdm8 ] ) we find for @xmath19 the expected spin - polarized ground state ( @xmath3)@xcite@xmath1@xcite . increasing @xmath24 up to @xmath97 @xmath62 this state persists with double - occupancy of the levels ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) of fig .",

    "therefore , we find a spin - polarized ground state in the weak coupling regime ( @xmath99 @xmath62 ) in agreement with nagaraja _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "although the spin - aligned ground state was ruled out in the case of 2 electrons we believe that the @xmath5 ground state for the 8-electron artificial molecule in the weak - coupling regime is reliable .",
    "this is emphasized by the correct asymptotics of the total energy in the limit @xmath20 ( see inset of fig .",
    "[ qdm8_e ] ) .",

    ", the total energy and density can be understood in a semiclassical picture : the densities ( for sufficiently large @xmath24 ) are well separated ( fig .  [ qdm8_10n ] ) and the total energy follows that of two identical dots each containing 4 electrons plus the coulomb repulsion between two point - like charges ( 4@xmath89 ) in distance @xmath24 . however , besides the quantum mechanical phenomenon of delocalized bonding and antibonding states we find a ( nonclassical ) xc energy related effect leading to the spin - polarized ground state .",
    "yannouleas and landman@xcite find from unrestricted hartree - fock calculations electron localization in the form of electron puddles and wigner supermolecules for a ratio @xmath101 between the oscillator length and bohr s radius of about @xmath102 .",
    "in contrast , ( exact ) quantum monte carlo calculations@xcite indicate a transition from the fermi liquid to the wigner crystal regime if @xmath101 is increased beyond a critical value of 4 .",
    "thus , our calculations performed for @xmath103 are obviously in the fermi liquid regime .",
    "although recent experiments succeeded in identifying molecular properties of coupled quantum dots like bonding and antibonding states@xcite the most convenient comparison between theoretical and experimental results is based on the chemical potential of the system .",

    "as it turns out , the dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath40 ( coulomb staircase ) exhibits features which depend on the coupling strength@xcite@xmath1@xcite@xmath1@xcite . while in the strong coupling limit",
    "the capacitance spectrum of the qdm is similar to that of the single quantum dot , it exhibits small spacings between the chemical potentials for @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 etc .",
    "for the weakly coupled qdm which correspond to the pairing of peaks observed in capacitance spectroscopy@xcite@xmath1@xcite .",

    "this effect destroys the splitting of the paired peaks .",
    "a conceptional difficulty of this model is that it is based on localized states yielding an asymmetric charge distribution for odd electron numbers . in our sdft calculations , however , the delocalized states also lead to the pairing of the conductance peaks in the weak - coupling regime ( fig.[coulstair ] ) while providing symmetric electron densities for all @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , we would like to emphasize , that the pairing of peaks does not depend on electron states localized at one center of the qdm , but can be caused by delocalized wavefunctions as well .",
    "in addition , delocalized states provide the advantage that it is not necessary to determine a transition from a coherent to an incoherent regime when the distance @xmath24 between the centers is continuously increased .",

    "the ground state of the 8-electron qdm can be characterized by a spin - polarized ground state ( 2 parallel spins ) for strong coupling and a spin - polarized configuration with 4 aligned spins in the weak - coupling limit .",
    "in contrast , the two - electron qdm is well described by sdft only in the strong - coupling regime whereas for large @xmath24 a hl approach yields better results .",
