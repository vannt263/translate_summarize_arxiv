    "most previous papers on glass transitions so far are concerned with near - equilibrium properties such as relaxations of the density time correlation functions or dielectric response . however , these quantities are too restricted or indirect , and there remains a rich group of unexplored problems in far - from - equilibrium states .",
    "in particular , shear is a relevant perturbation drastically changing the glassy dynamics when the shear rate @xmath0 exceeds the inverse of the structural relaxation time @xmath1 @xcite . in supercooled liquids ,",

    "the characteristic time @xmath5 is expected to be of order @xmath6 . remarkably , the shear stress @xmath7 tends to a limiting shear stress , @xmath8 , of order @xmath9 , @xmath10 being the shear modulus for infinitesimal strains .",
    "after application of shear , they also observed an overshoot of the shear stress before approach to a steady state .",
    "as a closely related problem , understanding of mechanical properties of amorphous metals has been of great technological importance @xcite .",
    "they are usually ductile in spite of their high strength . at low temperatures @xmath11 , localized shear bands , where zonal slip occurs ,",

    "@xcite numerically followed atomic motions after application of a small shear strain to observe heterogeneities among poorly and closely packed regions .",
    "such dynamic heterogeneities have been reported in recent simulations in sheared states @xcite and also in quiescent states @xcite .    in the study of elasto - plastic dynamics of solids , microscopic simulations",
    "are informative @xcite , while mean - field theories are instructive @xcite . in the latter theories ,",
    "the problem was reduced to to that of one element obeying a stochastic process under the influence of the average stress .",
    "the aim of this paper is then to present a space - time dependent , elasto - plastic dynamical model on the basis of well - defined nonlinear elastic theory .",
    "although our theory is still preliminary , we shall see that introduction of an order parameter , representing the vacancy or the local free volume , can give rise to dramatic effects similar to those reported in ref.@xcite .",
    "to introduce the fundamental concepts in our problem in the simplest manner , we first present a one - dimensional model which mimics a solid with shear deformations varying only in one direction ( 1d slip model ) .",

    "the system undergoes a pure elastic deformation @xmath36 in the initial stage , but slips ( jumps of @xmath37 by multiples of @xmath38 ) appear randomly throughout the system with increasing the average strain @xmath39 .",

    "pure elastic deformation is maintained in ( a ) , while no appreciable time evolution is detected after transients in ( b ) and ( c ) .",

    "thus , in elastically deformed amorphous solids ( before onset of plastic flow ) , we predict enhancement of the density fluctuations in particular directions of the wave vector .",

    "fig.7 demonstrates that these strain - induced disordered states are metastable as in fig.4 .",

    "it is a coarse - grained theory and the sharp peak of the structure factor , which is essential in the mode coupling theory @xcite , does not come into play . instead ,",
    "periodicity of the elastic energy with respect to the strains @xmath51 and @xmath50 and vacancy - dependence of the shear modulus are two major ingredients of our theory , which bring about metastable structural disordered states with heterogeneities in the vacancy and mass densities . as a closely related effect ,",
    "fischer @xcite observed excess scattering from nearly static density fluctuations with sizes in a range of 20 - 200 nm in glass - forming fluids .",
    "we believe that such large - scale frozen fluctuations can arise only as a result of nonlinear elastic deformations induced by structural disorder .",
    "we also mention previous simulations .",
    "et al_. @xcite applied a tensile ( elongational ) strain to a 2d model to produce slips and shear bands making angles of @xmath169 with respect to the stretched direction in agreement with experiments .",
    "the same results also follow from our model and will be reported shortly .",
    "we will show that the elastic energy to create a slip under tension is minimum for these directions .",
    "@xcite applied a tensile strain to a 3d model to induce a change from a perfect crystal to an amorphous solid .",
    "however , we admit that our results are still preliminary and it remains unclear how our theory corresponds to real physical effects . in particular , the initial conditions ( @xmath85 and @xmath170const . ) should be inappropriate for amorphous solids ( where structural disorder should preexist even before applying strain ) . in future work",
    ", we should start with initial states with various amounts of disorder and should also examine what parameter values are appropriate for amorphous solids .",
    "we mention analogous and instructive examples . in solids undergoing phase separation or structural transitions , the dependence of the shear modulus on the order parameter , written as @xmath108 , in the form @xmath171 is of crucial importance in phase ordering @xcite . in all these cases , local minimization of the nonlinear elastic energy ( @xmath172 )",
    "gives rise to heterogeneous metastable states where time - evolution is pinned .",
