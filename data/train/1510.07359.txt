    "quantum teleportation , one of the most fascinating protocols predicted by quantum mechanics @xcite , is a critical ingredient for quantum communication and quantum computation networks @xcite .",
    "it is the faithful transfer of quantum states between two distant parties which have established prior entanglement and can communicate classically . in the past two decades , quantum teleportation has attracted considerable attentions and been studied both theoretically and experimentally @xcite .",
    "however , in many scenarios , it is not the whole quantum state , but rather the information of a particular parameter physically encoded in it , that is needed to be transmitted .",
    "therefore , there is no need to teleport the full information of the quantum states themselves , but only the relevant parameter information is our practical concern .",
    "in contrast to the quantum state teleportation where the credibility of teleportation is measured by fidelity , the transmission of information that carried by a physical parameter is usually quantified by quantum fisher information ( qfi ) @xcite .",
    "qfi plays a significant role in the fields of quantum geometry of state spaces @xcite , quantum information theory @xcite and quantum metrology @xcite .",
    "particularly , the inverse of qfi characterizes the ultimate achievable precision in parameter estimation @xcite .    unfortunately , any realistic quantum system inevitably couples to other uncontrollable environments which influence it in a non - negligible way @xcite .",
    "then the issue of robustness of qfi against various sources of decoherence has soon been raised .",
    "numerous researches have indeed demonstrated that qfi is fragile and easily broken by environmental noise @xcite .",
    "this would be the most limiting factor for the applications of qfi in quantum teleportation , quantum metrology and other quantum tasks . in this context",
    ", it is an extremely important issue to protect the qfi from decoherence during the procedure of teleportation , especially for the atomic , trapped ions and other solid - state systems @xcite .",
    "partial measurements , which are generalizations of von neumann measurements , are associated with positive - operator valued measures ( povm ) . for partial measurements @xcite , the information extracted from the quantum state",
    "is deliberately limited , thereby keeping the measured state alive ( i.e. , without completely collapsing towards an eigenstate ) .",
    "thus , it would be possible to retrieve the initial information with some operations even when the quantum state has suffered decoherence . recently ,",
    "many proposals that exploit partial measurements to protect the fidelity of a single qubit , the quantum entanglement of two qubits and two qutrits from ad decoherence have been demonstrated in both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "this motivates us to study the qfi teleportation under decoherence by utilizing the partial measurements .    in this paper",
    ", we propose two schemes to show that partial measurements can greatly enhance the qfi teleportation under decoherence .",
    "in particular , we find that the combination of prior partial measurement and post partial measurement reversal is able to completely circumvent the influence of ad noise .",
    "our schemes for enhancing qfi are based on the fact that partial measurements are nondestructive and can be reversed with a certain probability .",
    "moreover , we analytically obtain the optimal parameters of the enhancement of qfi teleportation .",
    "we also demonstrate that the success probability of enhancing the qfi is higher than that of enhancing the fidelity of quantum state , which indicates that enhancing the teleported qfi is a more reasonable and economic way in the scenario of parameter estimation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : we introduce qfi and partial measurements in sec . [ sec:2 ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] , we then show how the qfi teleportation could be enhanced by partial measurements .",
    "we consider two different protocols , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , and compare the results in refs .",
    "@xcite where the fidelity of teleportation is improved by partial measurements .",
    "we show that the cost of enhancing qfi is smaller than that of improving fidelity , which is represented as the higher success probability .",
    "finally , the conclusions are summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] .",
    "qfi of a parameter characterizes the sensitivity of the state with respect to changes of the parameter .",
    "we consider that a parameter @xmath0 is encoded in quantum states @xmath1 ( in general , mixed states ) .",
    "the qfi of @xmath0 is defined as @xcite @xmath2,\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the so - called symmetric logarithmic derivative , which is defined by @xmath4 with @xmath5 . typically , there are three methods to calculate the qfi @xcite .",
    "the most frequently used one is diagonalizing the matrix as @xmath6 .",
    "then one can rewritten the qfi as @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the qfi for pure state @xmath9 with the form @xmath10 $ ] . according to eq .",
    "( [ e2 ] ) , the last term stemming from the mixture of pure states suggests that the qfi of a mixed state is smaller then pure - state case .    for the single qubit state ,",
    "a simple and explicit expression of qfi could be obtained . in the bloch sphere representation",
    ", any qubit state can be written as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the real bloch vector and @xmath13 denotes the pauli matrices .",
    "therefore , for the single qubit state , @xmath14 can be represented as follows @xcite @xmath15     is similar to the standard circuit of quantum teleportation while a post partial measurement is added before the unitary operations .",
    "( b ) in the circuit of scheme @xmath16 , alice performs a prior partial measurement ( with strength @xmath17 ) on the 2nd qubit before she sends it to bob . during their classical communications",
    ", alice has to send the results of bell measurement and the prior partial measurement strength @xmath17 to bob .",

    "the so - called partial measurement is @xmath20 where parameter @xmath17 @xmath21 is usually named as the strength of partial measurement .",
    "note that , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are not necessarily projectors and also nonorthogonal to each other , but @xmath24 . though the measurement operator @xmath23 is the same as von neumann projective measurement and associated with irrevocable collapse , @xmath22 is a partial measurement which we focus in this paper .",
    "the partial measurement @xmath22 has some interesting properties : ( i ) the strength @xmath17 is controllable and ( ii ) it could be reversed for the case @xmath25 .",
    "the reverse procedure can be noticed immediately to be @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the qubit bit - flip operation .",
    "the second line of eq .",
    "( [ e7 ] ) indicates that the reverse process @xmath28 can be achieved physically by three sequential operations : bit - flip , partial measurement and bit - flip .",
    "in realistic quantum teleportation , the maximally entangled state may lose its coherence and become a mixed state due to the interaction with its environment . noted that the quantum channel which is less entangled will reduce the teleported qfi .",
    "here , we propose two schemes to enhance the qfi teleportation under amplitude damping ( ad ) noise , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . for simplicity",
    ", we consider the scenario that alice has a perfect quantum memory while bob does nt .",
    "alice prepares the epr state and then sends one particle to bob . therefore , the entangled part possessed by bob will suffer ad noise and hence reduces the entanglement .",
    "the situation that both alice and bob influenced by noises could be treated similarly .",
    "we first examine the efficiency of scheme @xmath29 , in which only one post partial measurement is performed by bob before local operations ( e.g. , @xmath30 or @xmath31 ) .",
    "we assume the shared epr state is prepared in @xmath32 by alice and the input quantum state is an arbitrary superposition state latexmath:[\\[\\label{e8 }    which carries a phase parameter @xmath0 .",

    "our result indicates that the application of quantum partial measurement indeed enhances the qfi teleportation , which is very important for quantum metrology and other quantum information tasks .",
    "the underlying physical mechanism of the enhancement of qfi needs to be clarified further .",
    "one might deduce that the enhancement of teleported qfi should be attributed to the improvement of entanglement between alice and bob .",

    "( [ e16 ] ) , we have @xmath66 . however , it is contrary to one s expectation that @xmath67 , which means that , on the optimal condition of teleported qfi , the entanglement between alice of bob is not improved with the help of post partial measurement .",
    "therefore , the enhancement of qfi in scheme @xmath29 could not be attributed to the improvement of entanglement , but rather to the probabilistic nature of partial measurement .",
    "in contrast to the results in refs .",
    "@xcite , our ultimate aim is not to enhance the whole state fidelity but rather to improve the information of a particular parameter encoded in the teleported state ( i.e. , the qfi ) .",
    "therefore , as one might expect , improving the qfi teleportation is easier than enhancing the fidelity .",
    "this intuition could be confirmed by comparing the success probability . in the refs .",
    "@xcite , the success probability of improving the fidelity is @xmath68 , while in our scenario the success probability of enhancing qfi is @xmath69 similarly , we define the success probability improvement @xmath70 and it is easy to check that @xmath71 as @xmath72 $ ] .",
    "this means if we focus on teleporting the information of a particular parameter , we have no need to improve the teleportation fidelity of the whole state .",
    "enhancing the qfi teleportation would be more reasonable and economic in this case .",
    "although a post partial measurement can enhancing the qfi teleportation , part of qfi is still lost in the decoherence process .",
    "this is not our ultimate purpose . in this section ,",
    "we show that an improved scheme can completely circumvent the decoherence and retrieve all the initial qfi .",
    "the key improvement is that alice performs a prior partial measurement ( with the measurement strength @xmath17 ) on the second qubit ( q2 ) before she sends it to bob . during their classical communications",
    ", alice has to send the results of bell measurement and the information of @xmath17 to bob .",
    "when bob receives the results , he firstly carries out a post partial measurement reversal ( i.e. , bit - flip , partial measurement and bit - flip ) and then sequentially performs the local unitary operations . remarkably , we show below that the prior partial measurement plays a significant role in enhancing the qfi teleportation .",
    "according to the circuit depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1]b , the second qubit ( q2 ) experiences three processes : prior partial measurement , ad noise and post partial measurement reversal .",
    "the final entangled state could be represented as @xmath73(m_{0}^{-1})^{\\dagger}$ ] , where @xmath74 .",
    "the following qfi teleportation is based on above",
    "entangled state and the finally teleported state is @xmath75 .",
    "the corresponding three bloch vector components are @xmath76 with @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the teleported qfi is now given by @xmath79 the optimal post measurement strength @xmath80 could be obtained by calculating the following conditions : @xmath81 , and @xmath82 .",
    "the result turns to be @xmath83 and the maximally teleported qfi is @xmath84 hence it can be seen clearly that the eqs .",
    "( [ e25 ] ) and ( [ e26 ] ) reduce to eqs .",
    "( [ e16 ] ) and ( [ e17 ] ) if we set @xmath85 ( i.e. , without the prior partial measurement ) . however , in contrast to scheme @xmath29 , the most intriguing result is that the existence of prior partial measurement provides the possibility of dramatically enhancing the teleported qfi . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3]a , with the combination of prior and post partial measurement , the qfi could be greatly recovered by adjusting the partial measurement strength @xmath17 . particularly , when @xmath86 , @xmath87 without regard to the strength of ad noise .    by comparing these two schemes ,",
    "it is easy to conclude that scheme @xmath16 is much more efficient than scheme @xmath29 on enhancing qfi teleportation .",
    "however , why does the scheme @xmath16 work much better than scheme @xmath29 with the assistance of a prior partial measurement ? the underlying physics could be understood as follows : from eq .",
    "( [ e5 ] ) , we know that the stronger the partial measurement strength @xmath17 , the closer the initial epr state is reversed towards the @xmath88 state which is immune to ad noise . in the scheme @xmath29 , no prior partial measurement is carried out before the qubit goes through the ad noise , thus the amount of reversed qfi highly depends on the decoherence strength @xmath56 . while in the second scheme , a prior partial measurement is performed to move the state towards @xmath88 , which does not experience ad decoherence .",
    "then an optimal partial measurement reversal is applied to revert the qubit back to the initial state .",
    "therefore , the teleported qfi is not related to the decoherence strength @xmath56 but depends on the prior partial measurement strength @xmath17 .",
    "full qfi can entirely be recovered by the combination prior partial measurement and post partial measurement reversal when @xmath86 .",
    "the success probability of scheme @xmath16 is given by @xmath89 which obviously decays with the increase of @xmath17 and @xmath56 .",
    "note that when @xmath86 , @xmath90 .",
    "this means that the completely retrieve of qfi is attained at the expense of infinite low success probability .",
    "nevertheless , the price of recovering qfi is still smaller than that of fidelity . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the success probability of fidelity teleportation is @xmath91 from fig .",
    "[ fig3]b , we note that @xmath92 , which means the success probability of enhancing qfi is always higher than that of enhancing fidelity except for boundary values of @xmath17 and @xmath56 .",
    "this further confirms our conclusion that enhancing qfi is more economic than enhancing fidelity .      in the above analyses",
    ", we have assumed that alice is not affected by noises .",
    "in fact , these two schemes are universal for the case that both alice and bob suffer ad noise .",
    "since scheme @xmath29 is a reduced version of scheme @xmath16 , we only consider the later situation as an example . here , alice has to make prior partial measurements separately on q1 and q2 and then sends q2 to bob .",
    "it should be noted that alice must act the post partial measurement before she does the bell measurement while bob should perform the post partial measurement after he has received the results sent by alice .",
    "the finally teleported state can be characterized by the following bloch vectors @xmath93 , \\label{e31}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the normalized factor @xmath94 . with these equations in hand , we can calculate the teleported qfi and optimize the variables @xmath95 and @xmath96 . in order to simplify the calculations",
    ", we assume that both qubit 1 and 2 interact with the same environments , i.e. , @xmath97 .",
    "consequently , we have @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "the final results reduce to @xmath100 and @xmath101 from the above equation , we note that given the strength of ad noise @xmath56 , @xmath102 achieves the minimum value with @xmath85 .",
    "namely , no prior partial measurement is performed , which corresponds to the method of scheme @xmath29 .",
    "moreover , the minimum value of @xmath102 is still larger than the pure ad noise case , which indicates that partial measurement indeed can be used for enhancing qfi teleportation even when both alice and bob are subject to ad noise .",
    "if @xmath103 , i.e. , prior partial measurements are carried out before the qubits undergo ad noise , the teleported qfi is further enhanced .",
    "particularly , when @xmath86 , the initial qfi is almost entirely teleported to bob .",
    "before conclusion , we point out that our proposals are entirely feasible with the present experimental techniques .",
    "the standard quantum teleportation has already been realized from photonic system to trapped ion and atomic systems .",
    "the techniques of partial measurement are also fast developed in recent years @xcite . as demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , the partial measurements can be implemented with a brewster - angle glass plate ( bagp ) for photon - polarization qubit because the bagp probabilistically rejects vertical polarization ( @xmath19 state ) and completely transmits horizontal polarization ( @xmath18 state ) , which exactly functions as the measurement depicted by eqs .",
    "( [ e5 ] ) and ( [ e6 ] ) . on the other hand , the post weak measurement reversal",
    "could be realized by sequential bit - flip ( a half - wave plate for polarization qubit ) , partial measurement and bit - flip .",
    "alternatively , the partial measurements could be described with projective measurements in a larger hilbert space that includes an `` ancilla qubit '' @xcite .",
    "hence , the performance of partial measurement on the target qubit is equivalent to the action of von neumann projective measurement on the ancilla qubit which is previously coupled to it .",
    "motivated by this guideline , partial measurements can be realized in any quantum system and not restricted to photon and superconducting qubits .    in summary",
    ", we propose to enhance the qfi teleportation under decoherence utilizing partial measurements .",
    "thanks to the probabilistic nature of partial measurements , the teleported qfi could be greatly enhanced with the assistance of post partial measurement . remarkably , we further show that the combined action of prior and post partial measurement can even completely keep qfi from ad noise .",
    "in addition , we demonstrate that the price of enhancing teleported qfi is smaller than that of improving fidelity .",
