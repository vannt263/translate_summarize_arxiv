    "from now on we only consider the case of projective plane and a line on it .",
    "the goal of this section is to prove theorem 2 . in order to do so ,",
    "we start by taking the natural @xmath105 action on the relative hilbert scheme of points , and give a description of the fixed point loci . if the relative divisor is given by @xmath106 , we consider the following action on the projective plane :    @xmath107\\mapsto[t_0 x_0;t_1 x_1;t_2 x_2]$ ]    this action fixes the relative divisor , and so it induces an action on the normal bundle of this divisor and so an induced action on each bubble , which gives us an induced action on the whole relative hilbert scheme .",

    "the part with support on the plane should be supported on @xmath110 $ ] since this is the only fixed point on the plane , and since @xmath109 is fixed under the action so is its support . if we look locally at this part its a subscheme of @xmath111 that is fixed under the natural @xmath112 action , which means its a homogenous ideal supported at the origin .",
    "so if we fix @xmath113 to be the length this part , then they can be parameterized by young tableaux of length @xmath113 .    with the same argument",
    "one can see that the part supported on the bubbles , can have its support ( on each bubble ) only on the fibers above the zero and infinity .",
    "so if we look at one of the bubbles and only restrict our self to the fiber above zero then the local picture is @xmath111 with only one @xmath58 action on one of the coordinates , i.e. @xmath114 . if @xmath115 is a fixed ideal then we can pick a set of generators which are fixed under the action which means that each generator is homogenous with respect to @xmath116 .    if @xmath117 is such a set then @xmath118 for each @xmath119 , which means if we fix a root of @xmath120 , and denote by @xmath121 the multiplicity of this root in @xmath122 , then we have @xmath123 .",
    "to each root of @xmath120 we can associate a young tableau with @xmath82 boxes in the first column and @xmath83 boxes in the second column and so on .",
    "for example if we consider @xmath124 the corresponding diagrams for 0 and 1 are :    @xmath125    if we consider a deformation of this ideal that two of these roots come together the young tableau associated to the new root will be the sum of their young tableaux .",
    "@xmath126    for a given fixed point in each bubble we will have two such ideals , one above zero and one above infinity .",
    "if we fix the combinatorial data of young tableaux of all the roots of both of these ideals , and if they have @xmath113 and @xmath127 distinct roots ( respectively ) , then the closure of the locus of such ideals in the relative hilbert scheme is isomorphic to the moduli of @xmath113 unordered red and @xmath127 unordered blue points in @xmath58 moded out by the @xmath58 action . ( the @xmath58 acts by dilation ) .",
    "note that these points can come together .",
    "the moduli space of @xmath113 unordered points in @xmath58 is the @xmath128 since these points can be thought of as the roots of a monic polynomial of degree @xmath113 with non zero constant term .",
    "so the closure of this locus is isomorphic to @xmath129 modulo @xmath58 ( if @xmath113 and @xmath127 are both nonzero ) , and if one of them is zero , say @xmath127 , it s isomorphic to @xmath130 modulo @xmath58 . by using the @xmath58 action we can set the constant term of one of these polynomials to be equal to 1 , say the one with @xmath113 roots , and since @xmath58 acts on the constant term by @xmath131 the ambiguity",
    "is a @xmath132 root of unity .    to summarize for any fixed point",
    "we can consider the combinatorial data associated to it , and this will give us a stratification of the fixed point loci into parts which are isomorphic to product of quotients of products of @xmath133 by a finite group action .",
    "one can relate the cohomology and chow groups of the relative hilbert scheme to those of the fixed point loci .",
    "since for the equivariant cohomology we have the localization theorem , which says that for a given space @xmath3 there is an isomorphism ( up to torsions ) between @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "so if we find a surjective map to the cohomology of the fixed point loci , after killing the equivariant parameters that will give us a surjective map to the cohomology of the relative hilbert scheme .    in the next theorem we show that for the fixed point loci the natural map between chow and cohomology is an isomorphism . in order to prove that we prove that this map is an isomorphism for a class of stacks containing the fixed point loci as an element .",
    "since the chow classes on the fixed point loci are the chow classes on the whole space that are invariant under the action , if we compose this map by the natural map of theorem 3 we get a surjective map from the chow groups of the relative hilbert scheme to the cohomology of the fixed loci .    using the localization theorem",
    "we see that after killing the equivariant parameters the map between the chow groups and the equivariant cohomology groups of the relative hilbert scheme is surjective ( up to torsions ) , and hence an isomorphism .",
    "so the proof of the theorem 2 has been reduced to proof of the theorem 3 .",
    "the class of linear stacks is the smallest class of stacks that contains affine spaces of any dimension moded out by the action of a finite group , with the property that :    * the complement of any linear stack embedded in the quotient affine space is a linear stack * any space that can be stratified as a finite disjoint union of linear stacks is a linear stack    for any linear stack @xmath3 over the complex numbers , the natural map :    @xmath136    from the chow groups into he smallest space of borel - moore homology with respect to the weight filtration , is an isomorphism .    we will follow the argument of totaro in @xcite in which he proved this theorem for linear varieties .",

    "_ * the _ strong property if it satisfies the weak property and also",
    "_ + @xmath138 is surjective .",
    "since we only work with chow groups with coefficients in @xmath139 , by abuse of notation we denote the chow groups of @xmath3 with coefficients in @xmath139 by @xmath140 .",

    "\\a ) we have the following exact sequences :    @xmath143    in this diagram the first column is sujective , and the third and forth column are isomorphisms , so by diagram chasing we see that the second column is surjective and the fifth column is an isomorphism , which means @xmath142 satisfies the strong property .",
    "\\b ) by the same argument in this case by assumption the second column is surjective , and the third and fifth are isomorphism so the fourth column is surjective , which means that @xmath3 satisfies the weak property .",
    "the quotient affine space satisfies the strong property , and by the previous lemma we see that every linear stack satisfies the weak property .",

    "we extend nakajima s notation for the cohomology classes to the relative hilbert scheme of points .",
    "the cohomology of the @xmath2 has three generators and we denote them by @xmath144 for @xmath145 , also for the classes with support in the @xmath132 bubble we denote them by @xmath146 for @xmath147 .",
    "we will represented a cohomology class as a product of @xmath148s and @xmath149s , in order to show the support of the points in that cohomology class .",
    "if a point with support in a fixed cycle has multiplicity , we show that by putting that number in the bracket in front of it .",

    "we will call these classes the _ product classes_.    in the construction of the relative hilbert scheme we started by gluing certain hilbert schemes and we moded out by the @xmath58 actions .",
    "for those hilbert schemes by the nakajima theorem we have a set of generators for the cohomology and by the construction they were all chow classes as well .",
    "one can see that the product classes give us a set of generators for the invariant part of the chow group , i.e. the chow group of the quotient . by the result of theorem 2 , we know that these cycles will also give us a set of generators for the cohomology of the relative hilbert scheme of points in projective plane .    if @xmath158 then the relative hilbert scheme is just the hilbert scheme of @xmath2 , and we have : @xmath159 for @xmath147 .",
    "if @xmath160 the situation is not as clear as in the previous case . for example we have @xmath161=\\beta_0 ^ 1[2]$ ] , since there is a family over @xmath49 with these two classes as the fibers above @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "this can be seen by fixing a line in the @xmath2 and moving the fat point of multiplicity 2 along this line .",

    "note that the number of cycles of the form @xmath217 $ ] is given by the generating function @xmath218 , since each @xmath219 $ ] adds @xmath220 to the length of this cycle and adds @xmath221 to the dimension of the cycle , and since we are interested in the normalized poincar polynomial we have the @xmath222 terms , and since on each bubble there is a @xmath58 action we have to divide by @xmath223 .    in order to count number of possible configurations in the @xmath19 bubble , we have to allow one point supported on a zero - cycle , and since in the canonical form this point has the least multiplicity among the points in this bubble the generating function for the number of possible configurations of a bubble in the canonical form is given by :    @xmath224    since in the @xmath166 we have only point supported on two - cycles , the generating function for the number of cycles in the canonical form is given by :    @xmath225    each cycle in the canonical form which does not satisfies the properties of lemma  [ normal ] , has at least one single point supported on a bubble that it s multiplicity is greater than the minimum multiplicity in the next bubble .",
    "we can remove that point and add a marked point on the next bubble with that multiplicity and supported on a one - cycle .",
    "the dimension of this new cycle is 4 plus the dimension of the old cycle .",
    "note that a cycle might have more than one such points , and so the resulting cycle will have more than one marked point , and the difference between their dimension will be 4 time the number of marked points . hence in order to count the number of cycles that satisfy the properties of lemma  [ normal ] we should subtract the number of such cycles , and so the contribution of a point with multiplicity @xmath226 to the generating function will be @xmath227 since that point might be a marked point .",
    "one point that we should take into account is that the marked point can not be the point with minimum multiplicity in a given bubble so if the configuration of the points in a bubble is @xmath228\\prod_{j \\in a_1}\\beta_1^i[j]$ ] the the contribution of cycles of this form to the generating function is given by :    @xmath229\\right)= 1+\\frac{1}{t^{2}-1}\\left(-1+\\displaystyle\\prod_{m=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1-t^{-2}q^{m}}{1-t^2q^{m}}\\right)\\ ] ]    since for any point beside the one with multiplicity @xmath230 the contribution is @xmath227 , and because of the @xmath58 action and the fact that this point might have zero or one dimensional support the total contribution should be multiplied by @xmath231 , which allows us to write it in that form .    to summarize the generating function for the dimension of space of cycles which are in the form of lemma  [ normal ]",
    "is given by :    @xmath232    which agrees with the result of example  [ plane example ] , which shows that the relations introduced in the last section are all the relations in the case of projective plane and a line in it .",
    "i am very gratful to my advisor rahul pandharipande for sharing these ideas with me and many related discussion , and contributing theorem 1 .",
    "i would like to thank a. oblomkov and v. shende for many related discussions ."
