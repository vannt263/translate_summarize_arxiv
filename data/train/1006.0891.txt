    "pol-2 @xcite , the scuba-2 polarimeter , will also be used to study some of the scuba-2 observed regions .",
    "a first look at the data from the orion - b region has already been presented , by @xcite , and from the taurus region by @xcite .",
    "the survey seeks to perform some of the first large scale analyses of very large , high resolution submillimetre maps and data cubes of the closest molecular clouds and examine the star formation occurring within them .",
    "in particular , the spectral part of this survey will examine the properties of higher density gas than most large scale surveys , due to the higher critical density of the @xmath1  transitions ( @xmath6@xmath7 ) .",
    "this is better matched to the densities probed in submillimetre continuum emission than the lower @xmath8 transitions .",
    "the aims of the spectral survey are to search for and categorise high velocity outflows in order to identify protostars ; to examine the column density in cores ; to study the support mechanisms of protostars and their evolution ; and to examine the turbulence and velocity structure of the parent molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "scuba-2 continuum observations will also be made , and will cover an extremely large area compared to the current data sets available from e.g. scuba .",
    "as well as looking at the individual regions , the gbs will carry out statistical studies and comparisons on all the data sets and objects found .",

    "this will allow more detailed follow up work on the core kinematics ; however , the current noise level is more than adequate to study the bulk gas conditions and energetics across the entire region .",
    "one of the requirements of the gbs is to achieve reasonable rms uniformity across the scans . as a multi - detector array",

    "there was an anomalous baseline feature present in channels from 35.8 to 44.8 kms@xmath11 .",
    "the shape was similar to other known instrumental effects in harp / acsis data at the time the data were taken .",
    "the affected velocity region was blanked out , and then these channels were interpolated from surrounding data . across most of the map there is no emission at these affected velocities , with only a small region containing the tail of a high velocity outflow having visible emission .",
    "the structure of the high velocity tail affected in these spectra appears to be well matched by the simple interpolation .",

    "instead , a simple best guess has been taken ( on the basis of the contours of the extremely high velocity gas ) , and spatial regions chosen that appear to contain most of the outflow emission .",
    "these spatial regions have then been used to calculate red and blue shifted masses , momentum and kinetic energy for each outflow , using the same assumptions as for the global outflow properties .",
    "no attempt has been made to correct for the angle of inclination .",
    "the velocity ranges used in the calculations were -30 to 1.88kms@xmath11and 17.8 to 36.8kms@xmath11 .",
    "the spatial regions were defined separately for the red- and blue - shifted emission for each outflow .",
    "the masses calculated are shown in table [ tab : outflowmasses ] .",
    "again , no attempt was made to correct for inclination .",
    "the total mass for these outflows comes to merely 0.03 m@xmath4  for the blue - shifted emission and 0.01 m@xmath4  for the red - shifted emission ; this seems low considering the global values we have previously calculated .",
    "however , we have been very conservative with the velocity range used here , attempting to be sure that we are not being contaminated by the line centre emission or by overlapping outflows that do not reach such high velocities . if we use the same velocity ranges as used for the global properties than these values approximately double , making these outflows responsible for most of the high velocity mass in this cloud .    to further show that these outflows are indeed connected with the cores , fig .
