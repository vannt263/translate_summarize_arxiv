    "we showed recently  @xcite that the apparent breaking of qcd factorization in double - pomeron dijet production is also consistent with the same multi - pomeron exchange model .    here",
    "we address the question of whether such hard qcd factorization breaking takes place in photoproduction at very small values of bjorken @xmath13 at hera .",
    "experimental data for the diffractive photoproduction of dijets have been obtained recently at hera  @xcite .",
    "we first comment on the interpretation of the recent h1 data @xcite , and emphasize that the existing treatment does not lead to unique conclusions .",
    "we will consider a simple analysis of experimental data , which also includes information on dijet inclusive photoproduction .",

    "this uncertainty has been reduced in a recent lo and nlo analysis by the h1 collaboration  @xcite , which we will use in the following .",
    "the experimental situation concerning evidence for factorization breaking in the diffractive photoproduction of dijets is far from clear .",
    "the current status can be summarized as follows .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the distribution of gluons from the new h1 analysis  @xcite gives a prediction for the cross section of dijet production in dis , which is about 30% below the experimental results .",
    "however , this prediction was obtained in a lo qcd calculation , and nlo corrections can lead to an increase in the cross section , as was demonstrated for inclusive dijet production  @xcite .",
    "these effects are especially important in the small @xmath25 region where the resolved contribution mimics higher - order effects . on the other hand ,",
    "the new analysis predicts the cross section for the photoproduction of dijets to be about 30% above experimental data . in this case , higher order corrections can also be large and , moreover , the resolved contribution of fig .",
    "2(a ) , which is not well determined at present , is rather substantial ( especially at small @xmath25 ) .",

    "@xcite that there is an extra suppression of the @xmath29 interaction by a factor @xmath30 , which is independent of @xmath25 , should be treated with caution .    in order to clarify the situation we use a method , similar to that proposed by the cdf group for @xmath31 collisions  @xcite , which includes extra information on totally inclusive dijet production .",
    "the last process is described by the diagrams shown in fig .",

    "] in the proton , rather than those in the pomeron . as a consequence ,",
    "most quantities cancel in the ratio of diffractive and inclusive dijet production .",
    "indeed , we obtain r = , [ eq : ethel ] where the distribution of gluons in the diffractive process ( containing a rapidity gap ) is given by f_p^g(x_g,^2 ) = dt",
    "_ x_p^min^x_p^max dx_pf_p(x_p , t)f_p^g(,^2 ) , [ eq : frances ] with @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) and where @xmath34 is usually chosen to correspond to the experimental requirement on the rapidity gap .",
    "note that , although @xmath35 does not depend explicitly on the variable @xmath25 , this dependence appears due to kinematic correlations between the different variables .",
    "for example , since @xmath36 is strongly peaked near the value related to the experimental lower cutoff , an @xmath25 dependence arises via @xmath37 .    to predict the ratio @xmath35 of the experimental cross sections , ( [ eq : ethel ] ) , we need to choose the input for @xmath26 and the distribution of gluons in the pomeron . here",
    "we used a factorized expression in terms of the variables @xmath38 and @xmath39 , which corresponds to the exchange of a single pomeron pole @xmath9 , and which was used in analysis of experimental data , the contributions of secondary reggeons can be important , and are usually included in the data analysis  @xcite . ] .",
    "in general , we can have more complicated , unfactorizable forms ( see fig .  5 )    ,",
    "height=264 ]    but the same analysis of the ratio @xmath35 still holds .",
    "the theoretical prediction for the ratio @xmath35 is shown by the continuous curve in fig .",
    "6 .    , of diffractive and inclusive dijet photoproduction at hera , of ( [ eq : ethel ] ) , as a function of @xmath25 .",

    "the use of the mrst2001 or mrst2002  @xcite gluons gives a value of @xmath35 which is a bit larger .",
    "the predictions based on single - pomeron and multi - pomeron exchange are shown as continuous and dashed curves respectively .",
    "the ratio @xmath35 of the high @xmath1 processes is not expected to have absorptive corrections , and hence should follow the continuous curve .",

    "@xcite , together with the experimental cuts of the h1 dijet experiment  @xcite . as",
    "the result is sensitive to experimental cuts it would be desirable to repeat the calculation of @xmath35 using a monte carlo with the exact data cuts .",
    "so far we have considered the large @xmath1 region , where the contributions of the diagrams of fig .",
    "2(b ) , with unitarity corrections , are expected to be small . for small values of @xmath1 ( or real photons ) these corrections",
    "should be taken into account .",
    "however these corrections influence mainly the production of dijets by _ resolved _ photons , which takes place mostly at small and moderate values of @xmath25 . for _ direct _ production , via fig .  3 , the rescattering corrections are small .",
    "it is worthwhile to recall the reason .",
    "first , the cross section of dijet rescattering is proportional to @xmath49 and therefore the contribution of fig .",
    "[ fig:2](b ) is negligible .",
    "next , it is important to note that the parton distributions of the pomeron were measured in _",
    "direct _ inclusive processes such as those shown in figs .  3 and 5(a ) .",
    "thus they effectively include the multi - pomeron effects shown in fig .  5 , as well as the multi - pomeron counterpart to fig .",
    "2(b ) for the ` direct ' process .",
    "the direct process is thus not suppressed by any additional rescattering corrections , as all such effects are already embodied in the normalisation of the effective pomeron structure functions .",
    "these corrections , which are sometimes called ` the survival probability of rapidity gaps ' or ` the screening corrections from the underlying events ' , suppress the cross section for hard diffractive processes .",
    "a two - channel eikonal model  @xcite , with parameters tuned to fit all soft @xmath10 ( and @xmath50 ) data , has been used to predict the suppression factors for various hard diffractive processes .",
    "this model was used for the description of the diffractive production of jets in @xmath50 interactions  @xcite .",
    "here we apply the model to the photoproduction of dijets . to describe the photon ",
    "proton interaction we use the generalized vector dominance model .",
    "we tune the @xmath51-meson pomeron vertex so that , at @xmath52  gev , @xmath53  mb and the slope of the cross section for diffractive @xmath51 photoproduction is @xmath54  gev@xmath55 , to be consistent with the hera data  @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath40 in the two - channel eikonal ( eq .  ( 33 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite ) was taken to be @xmath56 to account for the large probability of @xmath51 meson excitation in comparison with that for the proton .    in the",
    "_ ideal _ theoretical limit , using the above model we find that the difference between the predictions for @xmath35 for dis and for photoproduction is a common suppression factor of 0.34 for photoproduction for all @xmath25 , except for the ` direct ' photon contribution at @xmath57 which has no suppression .",
    "however , in _ reality _ , the ` direct ' contribution is smeared by the experimental resolution and uncertainties connected with the jet finding algorithms . in an attempt to account for the smearing , we assume that the direct contribution is of the gaussian form @xmath58 , chosen to agree with the observations of fig .  4 of ref .",
    "@xcite .    with this smearing factor , and using the same experimental cuts for photoproduction as for the large @xmath1 dis data , we predict the suppression corresponding to the dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] . for small @xmath59 ,",
    "away from the smearing effects , we see the 0.34 suppression factor .",
    "that is the dashed `` photoproduction '' curve lies a factor 3 below the `` high @xmath1 '' continuous curve , which does not suffer unitarity corrections .",
    "we believe that this method of analysis is simple , informative and convenient from both the theoretical and experimental points of view , as most of the theoretical uncertainties ( as well as some experimental systematics ) cancel in the ratio @xmath35 .",
    "moreover , it can be used in other situations , such as , for example , the diffractive production of charm  @xcite .",
    "now we consider some problems with existing parameterizations of the quantity @xmath60 of ( [ eq : frances ] ) . by definition the quantity",
    "@xmath35 is less than unity .",
    "however , for @xmath61 in the pomeron flux factor and with the existing expressions for @xmath62  @xcite , the function @xmath35 quickly increases as @xmath63 .",
    "this can be seen from fig .  7 ,     of diffractive and inclusive dijet production , of ( [ eq : ethel ] ) , shown as a function of @xmath64 for different scales @xmath65 , with @xmath66 .",
    "absorptive corrections are neglected .",
    "[ fig:7],height=377 ]    which shows the ratio @xmath35 for different values of @xmath65 .",
    "indeed we see that @xmath35 approaches , or even exceeds , unity in the region , but all reasonable choices indicate a violation of unitarity similar to that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] . ] of @xmath67 for quite a range of virtualities",
    "this means that the application of the single regge pole approximation in the small @xmath13 region is not valid and leads to a violation of unitarity .",
    "the diagrams of fig .  5 , which take into account multi - pomeron exchanges , must be included ( as , for example , has been done in ref .",
    "@xcite ) in order to ensure that @xmath68 , and to restore unitarity .    comparing the diagrams of figs .",
    "[ fig:5 ] and [ fig:4 ] , we may say that the value of @xmath35 of ( [ eq : ethel ] ) represents the ratio of the cross section for gluon diffractive dissociation ( the lower part of fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] ) to the total gluon ",
    "proton cross section .",
    "in analogy with hadronic interactions , it is reasonable to believe that diffractive processes are less than one half of the total gluon ",
    "proton cross section  @xcite , and thus that @xmath69 . from fig .",
    "7 we see that , for gluons , this bound is already exceeded for @xmath70",
    ". moreover , the violation of unitarity appears in this region of @xmath64 over a large interval of @xmath65 .",
    "this is related to the fact that the diffractive production of states with small @xmath39 is not a high - twist effect .",
    "note that here we discuss the absorptive effect caused by the rescattering of intermediate partons ( described by the multi - pomeron exchange contributions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] ) , and not the rescattering of the fast constituents of the photon .",
    "the rescattering of intermediate partons takes place at scales much smaller than the hard scale @xmath65 .",
    "the main origin of the large values of @xmath35 ( which indicate the violation of unitarity ) is the power - like growth ( @xmath71 ) of the single - pomeron - exchange amplitude .",
    "this growth must be tamed . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] , this effect is much more important in inelastic diffraction than in the total cross section or pure inclusive processes . in inclusive processes",
    "the absorptive corrections are small due to agk cancellations  @xcite jets in inclusive processes , but fills in and destroys the rapidity gap in diffractive reactions . ] . in the total cross section , or in inclusive dis discussed here ,",
    "part of the absorptive effect is mimicked by the input gluon distribution .",
    "these observations may be important for understanding the problem of ` saturation ' in heavy - ion collisions , and also in diffractive charm production at very small @xmath13 .",
    "the recent observation of diffractive dijet photoproduction , combined with the measurements of diffractive dijet dis production , offers a unique opportunity to probe the special features of diffractive dynamics .",
    "we have emphasized that a good way to study the effects of factorization breaking due to rescattering ( or , in other words , the suppression caused by absorptive corrections ) is to take the ratio of the diffractive process to the corresponding inclusive production process , that is r = [ eq : gertrude ] of ( [ eq : ethel ] ) .",
    "a comparison of the predictions for @xmath35 with the data , for both photoproduction and dis , should be very informative .",
    "moreover many theoretical uncertainties , and some experimental uncertainties , cancel in the ratio .",
    "the high @xmath1 diffractive process , unlike diffractive photoproduction , is not expected to suffer rescattering corrections .",
    "indeed in the ideal theoretical limit we predict r(photoprod . )",
    "0.34 r(high  q^2 ) , [ eq : holly ] except at @xmath57 , where the ratios are expected to be equal since there should be very small rescattering corrections to the ` direct ' photon contribution . in practice the experimental resolution and jet finding algorithms",
    "have the effect of smearing the ` direct ' contribution .",
    "we estimated this effect and showed the resulting predictions for @xmath35 in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] .",
    "the 0.34 suppression of diffractive photoproduction due to absorptive corrections is clearly evident for small @xmath59 , where smearing effects are negligible . since the predictions for @xmath35 depend on the experimental cuts ( in particular on the value of @xmath72 ) the curves should be recalculated to match the conditions of the experiment , including the smearing of the @xmath25 distribution .",
    "however the ratio of ratios , @xmath73 , for @xmath74 should be a reasonably stable prediction .",
    "clearly it will be interesting to measure @xmath35 as a function of @xmath1 . at large @xmath1",
    "the absorptive corrections are expected to be negligible and the prediction is given by the factorization theorem , that is the continuous curve in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] .",
    "however as @xmath1 decreases we would expect the prediction for @xmath35 to tend gradually towards the dashed photoproduction curve .",
    "recall that for @xmath75 the values of @xmath35 have an additional uncertainty due to the contamination of the ` direct ' photon contribution .",
    "the above behaviour of @xmath35 is also expected for diffractive charm production .",
    "however , in this case , the relative contribution of the ` direct ' photon process ( where the absorptive effect is expected to be small ) is enhanced by a colour factor .",
    "the value of @xmath35 is proportional to the effective number of gluons coming from the pomeron , and may be considered as the ratio of gluon diffractive dissociation to the total gluon ",
    "proton cross section . at relatively low scales , we see from fig",
    ".  [ fig:7 ] , the ratio in the absence of absorptive corrections exceeds the pumplin bound , @xmath76 , already at @xmath70 .",
