    "conservative mass transfer , mass loss from the binary system due to an x - ray irradiated wind outflow and magnetic cycling in one of the binary components are the other possibilities .",
    "we first examine the possibility and consequences of the case of a conservative mass transfer in this system , followed by the case of an x - ray irradiated wind outflow and magnetic cycling in the companion star .      in the case of conservative mass transfer",
    ", the mass transfer rate from the companion star equals the accretion rate onto the neutron star .",
    "we have estimated the mass accretion rate using the best known estimate of the mass of the neutron star ( m@xmath28 ) and the companion star ( m@xmath29 ) ( muoz - dariaz et al .",
    "2005 ) in this system : @xmath30 and a mass ratio q @xmath31 in the range : @xmath32 in the case of compact binaries , the orbital angular momentum ( j ) is given by ( king 1988 ) : @xmath33 where ,    m = = total mass of the binary system = @xmath34 + @xmath35 + g = gravitational constant + a = binary orbital separation .",
    "for conservative mass transfer , all the mass lost from the companion is accreted by the compact object ( @xmath36 ) and the orbital angular momentum is conserved ( @xmath37 = 0 ) .",
    "in such a case , the mass accretion rate ( @xmath38 ) is related to the orbital period ( @xmath1 ) as : @xmath39    since the observed @xmath40 is 2.10 @xmath3 10@xmath41 yr@xmath5 , therefore , we get a mass accretion rate of ( 4.2@xmath05.2 ) @xmath3 10@xmath12 m@xmath13 yr@xmath5 and a mass transfer timescale of @xmath15 10@xmath42 yr .",

    "for a neutron star with a magnetic moment @xmath47 ( @xmath15 b@xmath48 ) , the spin frequency derivative @xmath49 is related with the mass accretion rate as ( frank et al .",
    "2002 ) : @xmath50 where ,    m@xmath51 = = mass ( m ) of the neutron star in units of 1 m@xmath13 + @xmath52 = accretion rate in units of 10@xmath53 g s@xmath5 + @xmath54 = magnetic moment in units of 10@xmath55 g @xmath56 + i@xmath57 = the moment of inertia of the accreting star in units of + 10@xmath58 g @xmath59 .",

    "s s@xmath5 .",
    "these values imply a magnetic field strength of ( 1@xmath03 ) @xmath3 10@xmath14 g.    the following caveats apply to the case of conservative mass transfer :    * it requires a large mass transfer which corresponds to luminosity near the eddington rate .",
    "considering the uncertainties in some of the parameters used above , a near - eddington accretion luminosity is not inconceivable , especially because this source has a corona surrounding it ( white @xmath17 holt 1982 ; heinz @xmath17 nowak 2001 ; bayless et al .",
    "a comparison of the l@xmath61/l@xmath62 ratio of this system with other lmxbs also suggest that the true x - ray luminosity of the central x - ray source is probably significantly higher .",
    "see bayless et al .",
    "( 2010 ) for more discussion on this .",
    "for example , in ss433 the mass transfer rate is believed to be much higher than the eddington rate , that results in accumulation of material around the compact object which blocks its x - ray emission ( begelman , king , @xmath17 pringle 2006 ; clark , barnes , @xmath17 charles , 2007 ) . *",
    "it requires the neutron star to have a low magnetic field strength of ( 1@xmath03 ) @xmath3 10@xmath14 g while from the high energy cutoff in the x - ray spectrum ( parmar et al .",
    "2000 ) , jonker @xmath17 van der klis ( 2001 ) determined a magnetic field strength of @xmath15(1@xmath05)@xmath310@xmath25 g . it should be noted that the coronal x - rays dominate the x - ray spectrum of this source and the pulsed x - rays contribute to only a few percent of the total x - ray emission .",
    "thus the x - ray spectral shape is unlikely to be a reliable indicator of the magnetic field strength of the compact star . * in accreting neutron stars",
    ", we expect pulsations only if the compact object possesses a magnetic field strong enough to disrupt the inner regions of the accretion disc and channel the accretion flow onto the polar caps .",
    "in other words , accretion onto the neutron star is controlled by the magnetic field if the magnetospheric radius is larger than the stellar radius . in case of 4u 1822 - 37 , the observed values of the mass transfer rate and the magnetic moment , indicate a magnetospheric radius of  2 @xmath3 10@xmath8 cm , which is of the same order as the neutron star radius .",
    "therefore , it is not certain whether the conservative mass transfer is indeed responsible for the observed changes in the orbital period .",
    "however , several low mass x - ray binaries , such as sax j1808.4 - 3658 , do show pulsations at similar luminosity level even though they have a low surface magnetic field of @xmath63 g ( di salvo @xmath17 burderi 2003 ) .",
    "* for the accretion luminosity , spin period and magnetic field strength mentioned above for a conservative mass transfer case , the neutron star is far from spin equilibrium .",
    "detection of such a system is a novelty and unlikely , unless the current x - ray state is a long lived transient phase . here",
    "one may note that in the recent years , many lmxbs have been found which spend a small fraction of the time in transient high states , for example , the millisecond accreting pulsars .",
    "mass loss from the binary system can occur in the form of x - ray irradiated wind outflow . in case of lmxb 4u 1822 - 37",
    ", there is no signature of wind outflow in the form of absorption lines in high resolution x - ray spectrum ( cottam et al .",
    "recently , bayless et al . (",
    "2010 ) reported a broad c iv emission line in the uv spectrum of 4u 1822 - 37 , indicating a strong disk wind outflow .",
    "they have derived a wind outflow velocity of 4000 km s@xmath5 , based on a measured width of 45 @xmath64 of the c iv emission line .",
    "however , these observations are insufficient to estimate the total mass outflow rate .",
    "secular changes such as magnetic cycles in the secondary star ( hellier et al .",
    "1990 ) is also a possible mechanism responsible for the observed orbital evolution in 4u 1822 - 37 .",
    "however , the spectral type and the evolutionary history of the companion star is unknown ( muoz@xmath0dariaz et al . 2005 ) .",
    "we have presented new and more accurate measurement of orbital evolution of the lmxb 4u 182237 and a longer time base for measurement of its spin evolution . considering the possibility of a large intrinsic l@xmath61 and some evidence of mass outflow ,",
    "we conclude that the orbital evolution in this system is complex including the effects of a large mass transfer rate and x - ray irradiated wind outflow . in this scenario ,",
