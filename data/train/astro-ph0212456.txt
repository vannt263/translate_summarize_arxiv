    "it is widely believed that accretion disks around kerr black holes exist in many astrophysical environments , ranging from active galactic nuclei to some stellar binary systems @xcite .",
    "people usually assume that the inner boundary of a thin keplerian disk around a kerr black hole is located at the marginally stable circular orbit , inside which the centrifugal force is unable to stably balance the gravity of the central black hole @xcite . in the disk region",
    ", particles presumably move on nearly circular orbits with a very small inward radial velocity superposed on the circular motion , the gravity of the central black hole is approximately balanced by the centrifugal force .",
    "as disk particles reach the marginally stable circular orbit , the gravity of the central black hole becomes to dominate over the centrifugal force and the particles begin to nearly free - fall inwardly . the motion of fluid particles in the plunging region quickly becomes supersonic then the particles loose causal contact with the disk , as a result the torque at the inner boundary of the disk is approximately zero ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "this is usually called the `` no - torque inner boundary condition '' of thin accretion disks .",
    "some recent studies on the magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) of accretion disks have challenged the `` no - torque inner boundary condition '' .",
    "magnetic fields have been demonstrated to be the most favorable agent for the viscous torque in an accretion disk transporting angular momentum outward ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . by considering the evolution of magnetic fields in the plunging region ,",
    "krolik @xcite pointed out that magnetic fields can become dynamically important in the plunging region even though they are not so on the marginally stable circular orbit , and argued that the plunging material might exert a torque to the disk at the marginally stable circular orbit . with a simplified model , gammie",
    "@xcite solved maxwell s equations in the plunging region and estimated the torque on the marginally stable circular orbit .",
    "he demonstrated that the torque can be quite large and thus the radiation efficiency of the disk can be significantly larger than that for a standard accretion disk where the torque at the inner boundary is zero .",
    "furthermore , agol and krolik @xcite have investigated how a non - zero torque at the inner boundary affects the radiation efficiency of a disk .",
    "numerical simulations of mhd disks @xcite have greatly improved our understanding of disk accretion processes .",
    "these simulations show that the magneto - rotational instability effectively operates inside the disk and leads to accretion , though the accretion picture is much more complicated than that assumed in the standard theory of accretion disks . generally , the disk accretion is non - axisymmetric and strongly time - dependent .",
    "it is also found that , as disk material gets into the plunging region , the magnetic stress at the marginally stable circular orbit does not vanish but smoothly extends into the plunging region @xcite , though the effect is significantly reduced as the thickness of the disk goes down @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the specific angular momentum of particles in the plunging region does not remain constant , which implies that the magnetic field may be dynamically important in the plunging region @xcite .",
    "all these results are fascinating and encouraging .",
    "unfortunately , due to the limitation in space resolution and time integration , stationary and geometrically thin accretion disks are not accessible to the current 2-d and 3-d simulations .",
    "so it remains unclear how much insights we can get for stationary and geometrically thin accretion disks from these simulations @xcite .    instead of small - scale and tangled magnetic fields in an accretion disk transporting angular momentum within the disk , a large - scale and ordered magnetic field connecting a black hole to its disk may also exist and play important roles in transportation of angular momentum and energy between the black hole and the disk @xcite .",
    "recent _ xmm - newton _ observations of some seyfert galaxies and galactic black hole candidates provide possible evidences for such a magnetic connection between a black hole and its disk @xcite .",
    "all these promote the importance of studying the evolution and the dynamical effects of magnetic fields around a kerr black hole .    in this paper",
    ", we use a simple model to study the evolution of magnetic fields in the plunging region around a kerr black hole .",
    "we assume that around the black hole the spacetime metric is given by the kerr metric ; in the plunging region , which starts at the marginally stable circular orbit and ends at the horizon of the black hole , a stationary and axisymmetric plasma fluid flows inward along timelike geodesics in a small neighborhood of the equatorial plane .",
    "the plasma is perfectly conducting and a weak magnetic field is frozen to the plasma . the magnetic field and the velocity field",
    "have two components : radial and azimuthal .",
    "we will solve the two - dimensional maxwell s equations where the magnetic field depends on two variables : time and radius , and investigate the evolution of the magnetic field .",
    "this model is similar to that studied by gammie @xcite , but here we include the time variable . furthermore , we ignore the back - reaction of the magnetic field on the motion of the plasma fluid to make the model self - consistent , since if the dynamical effects of the magnetic field are important the strong electromagnetic force will make the fluid expand in the vertical direction",
    ". the ignorance of the back - reaction of the magnetic field will allow us to to analytically study the evolution of the magnetic field , but it will prevent us from quantitatively studying the dynamical effects of the magnetic field .",
    "however , we believe that the essential features of the evolution of the magnetic field in the plunging region is not sensitive to the details of the dynamical effects . to check the self - consistency of the model , we will estimate the dynamical effects of the magnetic field by considering the back - reaction of the magnetic field on the fluid motion .",
    "we will also discuss the self - consistent solutions to the coupled maxwell and dynamical equations , and look for implications to the `` no - torque inner boundary condition '' .",

    "we see that , the boundary value of the radial component of the magnetic field at the marginally stable circular orbit is more important in determining the strength of the magnetic field in the plunging region than the toroidal component . the initially toroidal component is attenuated in the plunging region by the radial expansion of the fluid ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",

    "this leads to the amplification of the magnetic field in the plunging region ( fig .",

    "thus , the evolution of magnetic fields in the plunging region is very different from that in the disk region , in the latter case the state of the magnetic field is determined by the local mhd processes .",
    "the difference is caused by the following fact : in the disk region the fluid has a very small radial velocity so that local mhd processes have shorter time scales than the radial motion ; in the plunging region the fluid has a large radial velocity so that local mhd processes usually have longer time scales than the radial motion .    in deriving the solutions we have assumed that the dynamical effects of the magnetic field in the plunging region are unimportant [ the kinematic approximation adopted in assumption ( 3 ) ] . to justify this assumption ,",
    "we have studied the dynamical effects of magnetic fields in the stationary state in two ways .",
    "first , we estimate the dynamical effects of magnetic fields by considering the back - reaction : substituting the solutions of maxwell s equations we obtained , where we assumed that fluid particles move on geodesics , into the dynamical equations to check if the motion of the fluid is significantly affected by magnetic fields . in this way",
    ", we estimate the dynamical effects of magnetic fields on the motion of the fluid by calculating the parameters @xmath285 , @xmath286 and @xmath287 defined by eq .",

    "[ fig9 ] ) . however , the evolution of the magnetic field , which appears in the numerators of @xmath285 , @xmath286 and @xmath287 , sensitively depends on the orientation of the magnetic field on the marginally stable circular orbit , the latter is essentially determined by the mhd processes in the disk region .",
    "if we require that the solutions in the plunging region are smoothly joined to the solutions in the thin keplerian disk region , then it is reasonable to assume that on the marginally stable circular orbit , as well as in the disk region , the magnetic field is parallel to the velocity field : @xmath398 ( see the appendix ) .",
    "this implies that for the solutions in the plunging region we should have @xmath307 [ eq .",
    "( [ psi0 ] ) ] , i.e. the orientation of the magnetic field follows the orientation of the velocity field of the fluid [ eq .  ( [ pc ] ) ] . with such a boundary condition ,",
    "we have calculated @xmath285 , @xmath286 and @xmath287 , assuming that particles move on geodesics .",
    "we see that , if they are @xmath299 on the marginally stable circular orbit , then they remain so in the plunging region ( figs .",

    "indeed , @xmath285 , @xmath286 and @xmath287 decrease in the plunging region for sufficiently small @xmath225 on the marginally stable circular orbit .",
    "second , we self - consistently solve the coupled maxwell and dynamical equations on the horizon of the black hole , check how much has changed in the specific angular momentum of fluid particles since they leave the marginally stable circular orbit .",
    "the specific energy of fluid particles is not changed by a magnetic field that satisfies @xmath307 [ see eq .",

    "[ fig12 ] .",
    "we see that , though the specific angular momentum of fluid particles is changed by the magnetic field , the effects are always small assuming that on the marginally stable circular orbit the dynamical effects of the magnetic field are not important . for example , for @xmath399 we have @xmath369 if @xmath400 on the marginally stable circular orbit .",
    "we have also calculated the ratios @xmath401 and @xmath402 on the horizon ( fig .",

    "[ fig13 ] shows that their values on the horizon are quite small .",
    "both approaches ( back - reaction and self - consistent solutions ) confirm that the dynamical effects of the magnetic field are unimportant in the plunging region if they are so on the marginally stable circular orbit .",
    "our results differ from that of gammie @xcite , in which he claimed that in the plunging region the dynamical effects of magnetic fields can be important .",
    "the difference is caused by the fact that gammie used a boundary condition that is different from ours for the magnetic field .",
    "gammie assumed that @xmath404 , where @xmath405 is the angular velocity of the disk at the marginally stable circular orbit , while we assume that @xmath307 .",
    "gammie s boundary condition implies that @xmath406 at @xmath170 ( as clearly stated in his paper ) , which makes @xmath170 a singular point where @xmath407 ( to keep the mass flux @xmath408 nonzero ) .",
    "hence , gammie s solutions are not well - behaved at the marginally stable circular orbit .",
    "our boundary condition allows the solutions in the plunging region to be smoothly joined to the solutions in the disk region ( see the appendix ) , since in our solutions all physical quantities are finite at the marginally stable orbit .",
    "certainly , to precisely take care of the transition from the disk region to the plunging region , gas pressure and non - electromagnetic stress must be properly taken into account near the inner edge of the disk .    as mentioned in the introduction , recently the `` no - torque inner boundary condition '' for thin accretion disks has been challenged by some authors ( including gammie ) based on their studies on the evolution of magnetic fields in the plunging region @xcite .",
    "the results in this paper suggest that in the plunging region the dynamical effects of the magnetic field are not important , if the solutions in the plunging region are smoothly joined to the the solutions in the thin keplerian disk region .",
    "thus , the argument against the `` no - torque inner boundary condition '' is not founded .",
    "finally , we note that in the paper we have neglected dissipative processes like magnetic reconnection and ohmic dissipation , and the evaporation effect arising from the magnetic buoyancy and mhd instabilities .",
    "these processes operate in disks to limit the amplification of magnetic fields ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "certainly it is conceivable that they can also operate in the plunging region to reduce the amplification effect of magnetic fields .",
    "if these processes are important , the results of this paper tend to overestimate the amplification of magnetic fields in the plunging region .",
    "then , the dynamical effects of magnetic fields should be weaker than that we have estimated without considering dissipative processes , which will strengthen our conclusion that the dynamical effects of magnetic fields are unimportant in the plunging region .",
    "in the disk region ( @xmath409 ) , viscosity plays an important role in the dynamics of disk particles .",
    "the viscosity transports angular momentum outward and dissipates energy , which leads to disk accretion .",
    "so , in the disk region , particles move on non - geodesic worldlines .    in the vertical direction ,",
    "the gravity of the black hole is balanced by the gradient of the total pressure (= gas pressure + radiation pressure + magnetic field pressure ) in the disk .",
    "therefore , in a small neighborhood of the disk central plane , disk particles are more likely moving on planes parallel to the equatorial plane , rather than moving radially as in the plunging region .",
    "to describe such a motion , cylindrical coordinates @xmath410 are more suitable , where @xmath122 and @xmath411 have the same meaning as those in the boyer - lindquist coordinates , to the first order @xmath118 also has the same meaning as that in the boyer - lindquist coordinates , but @xmath412 where @xmath413 .    in the cylindrical coordinates , in a small neighborhood of the disk central plane",
