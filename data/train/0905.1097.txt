    "evolution on complex fitness landscapes has been advanced as a key idea in recent mathematical approaches to evolution theory @xcite .",
    "concepts such as neutral networks and punctuated equilibrium , which are central to such disparate areas as molecular evolution and paleontology , can be brought together within that unifying framework .",
    "since frustration and quenched disorder combined together yield an almost infallible recipe to generate complexity @xcite , the evolutionary dynamics on rugged fitness landscapes became a research topic in the statistical mechanics of disordered systems .",
    "there are a few reasons to consider spin - glass or random fitness landscapes in the study of molecular evolution .",
    "fitness functions are related to the binding affinity of a molecular replicator ( a rna - like molecule ) to a non - specific replicase @xcite .",
    "given our present incapacity to predict affinity ",
    "single amino acid replacements may prevent binding altogether , increase affinity by orders of magnitude , or simply leave it unaffected @xcite  the assignment of fitness values chosen at random from some probability distribution seems to be the least biased course to introduce fitness in evolution models .",
    "in addition , evolution in any fitness fitness landscape characterized by a finite correlation length will resemble evolution in a random landscape when viewed at an appropriate coarse - grained scale of the sequence configuration space @xcite .",
    "finally , the analysis of the evolution on rugged or random fitness landscapes has produced dynamical patterns , such as punctuated equilibria ( see @xcite ) , that are actually observed in microbial populations @xcite .",
    "building on a mapping between the infinite - population quasispecies model @xcite and an anisotropic two - dimensional ising spin model in which the time @xmath0 is one of the lattice dimensions @xcite , the evolutionary version of derrida s random energy model ( rem ) @xcite was solved exactly in the infinite - time , equilibrium regime @xcite .",
    "two distinct phases were found , corresponding to the selective and non - selective regimes that characterize a model that exhibits an error threshold transition ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , the dynamics of this model was investigated in the limit of strong selection using approximate techniques @xcite .",
    "since strong selection is not the only biologically relevant situation , and the selective regime is not the only important dynamic regime , a more general approach to the dynamics of the evolutionary version of rem is necessary .    in this contribution , we explore a different mapping between evolutionary dynamics and statistical physics , namely , the mapping between the parallel mutation - selection scheme and the quantum ising chain in a transverse field @xcite , to solve exactly the dynamics on rem - like fitness landscape for all range of the selection and mutation parameters .",
    "this approach was already successfully used in the analysis of a simpler fitness landscape , the single - peak fitness landscape @xcite and is based on the results of refs .",
    "a more recent application was the solution of the evolutionary dynamics in the case of symmetric fitness landscapes ( i.e. , the fitness is a function of the hamming distance from a given reference sequence ) @xcite .    here",
    "we consider two landscapes , the ordinary rem landscape and the ferromagnetic rem landscape , where one of the energy levels of the ordinary rem is selected and changed to an energy value lower than the typical ground state energy .",
    "for both landscapes , we find that the dynamic behavior for short times depends on the ( malthusian ) fitness of the initial configuration .",
    "when the fitness of the initial configuration is higher than the mutation rate , the dynamics freezes at the initial configuration , resulting in a pattern of stasis ( provided that the initial fitness is not the global maximum ) .",
    "otherwise , when the initial fitness is lower than the mutation rate , the dynamics is characterized by a regime of pure diffusion in the sequence space . in the ordinary rem , we find that these short - time regimes  diffusion or stasis ",
    "change abruptly to a spin - glass - like regime which is associated to the equilibrium frozen phase of the rem .",
    "this dynamic transition is signaled by a discontinuity of the mean fitness as well as of the average overlap with the initial , reference sequence .",
    "most importantly , we find that these quantities tend to their equilibrium values as @xmath1 for large time @xmath0 . in the case of the ferromagnetic rem",
    "we find up to four distinct dynamic regimes : diffusion or stasis , spin glass and ferromagnetic . as before ,",
    "the transitions between these regimes are signaled by discontinuities in the biologically relevant observables , but the system relaxes to the equilibrium ferromagnetic state in a finite time .",
    "our results are interesting for the statistical physics aspects of information theory as well @xcite , as rem statistical physics gives a simple derivation of most of information theory results .",
    "the idea of coding via statistical mechanics is to construct a spin hamiltonian , which has a known ground state for a specific choice of the deterministic spin couplings ( the non - trivial aspect of the problem is that the ground state of the hamiltonian should be robust to some degree of noise in those couplings ) .",
    "the ground state of the hamiltonian could then be recovered from the starting configuration using some update dynamics , as in the case of associative memory neural networks @xcite .",
    "thus by solving an evolution model we get as a by - product an analytical decoding dynamics for optimal codes .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : chain ] we introduce the evolution equations for the parallel mutation - selection scheme and discuss its relation with the quantum ising chain in a transverse field .",
    "the basic equations for the dynamics obtained using the suzuki - trotter formalism @xcite are introduced also in that section . in sect .",

    "[ sec : conc ] we summarize our main results and present some concluding remarks .",
    "in this contribution we consider the so - called parallel mutation - selection scheme in which mutation and selection are considered as independent events @xcite , i.e. , mutations can occur at any time during the existence of a sequence , not only at the moment of replication as assumed in eigen s molecular quasispecies model @xcite . as usual , we represent a molecule or genome of length @xmath2 by a sequence of binary digits ( spins ) @xmath3 with @xmath4 so that there are @xmath5 distinct molecules @xmath6 . in the parallel mutation - selection scheme , the relative frequencies of molecules @xmath7 are given by @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 are malthusian fitnesses , which can take on positive as well as negative values @xcite , and @xmath10 is the mutation rate from @xmath11 to @xmath12 .",
    "since mutations can connect only nearest neighboring sequences in the @xmath5-dimensional sequence space , we choose @xmath13 if @xmath14 ; @xmath15 and @xmath16 , otherwise . here",
    "@xmath17 is the hamming distance between sequences @xmath11 and @xmath12 and @xmath18 is the mutation rate per site . as @xmath19 ,",
    "the dynamics ( [ p_i ] ) maintains the normalization @xmath20 for all @xmath0 .",
    "finally , we recall that @xmath21 determines the so - called fitness landscape .",
    "a key observation at this stage is the finding that the non - linear dynamic system ( [ p_i ] ) can be reduced to a linear system @xmath22 where @xmath23 using the transformation @xcite @xmath24 .\\ ] ] in practice , we solve the linear system ( [ x_i ] ) and then obtain the original sequence frequencies via the normalization @xmath25 . from the numerical perspective ,",
    "solution of this linear system is straightforward , the sole limitation being the exponential increase in the number of equations with the sequence length @xmath2 .",
    "for certain fitness landscapes , however , the case of infinite length sequences can be solved analytically thanks to a cunning observation by baake et al .",
    "@xcite , who realized that the linear system ( [ x_i ] ) can be mapped into an ising quantum chain in a transverse magnetic field with spin interactions that depend on the specific choice of the fitness landscape .",
    "more pointedly , the linear system ( [ x_i ] ) is equivalent to the evolution of the quantum system described by the hamiltonian @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 stands for the pauli spin operators acting in site @xmath28 , i.e. , @xmath29 with @xmath30 in the @xmath28th place .    introducing the time evolution operator @xmath31 we can write a formal expression for the original molecules frequencies , namely , @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 guarantees the correct normalization . here",
    "@xmath35 where @xmath36 is an eigenstate of @xmath37 .",
    "since there is an equivalence between the quantum ising chain , such as that described by the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , and a classical anisotropic two - dimensional ising spin model @xcite , then baake et al.s observation shows that there is a mapping between the parallel mutation - selection evolution scheme and the two - dimensional ising model .",

    "the simplest fitness landscape for which the transition amplitudes @xmath41 can be calculated exactly is the so - called single - peak ( sp ) fitness landscape .",

    "the spin interactions for the sp landscape can be written as @xcite @xmath58 in the limit @xmath59 . what makes the sp problem analytically solvable was the remarkable finding that @xmath60 can be written in a factorized form @xmath61 we refer the reader to the appendix of ref .",
    "@xcite for the detailed derivation of this result , which is based on the trotter - suzuki scheme @xcite ( see also @xcite ) that introduce infinitely many intermediate time steps between the initial and the final configurations .",

    "( [ f_sp ] ) ] in the hamiltonian , which results in a ground - state configuration with fitness much greater than the fitness of typical configurations .",
    "this is obvious for the sp landscape ( except for the master , all configurations have zero fitness ) , but also holds for the rem landscape for which typical configurations have fitness on the order of @xmath63 whereas the ground - state has fitness on order of @xmath2 .",
    "it is instructive to present the results for @xmath60 in the case of the single - peak landscape defined in the previous section and investigated in ref .  @xcite . in particular , here we focus on the time dependence of the average overlap @xmath46 between the configurations at time @xmath0 and the initial configuration , a quantity which was not explored in that seminal work .",

    "finally , we note that the probability that @xmath176 is @xmath181 which tends to @xmath182 for large @xmath2 , hence we could more simply distinguish the two situations  high and low initial fitness  by verifying whether the energy of the initial configuration is positive or negative .",
    "more importantly , these two cases are equally likely and our penchant for the low - fitness initial configuration here is justified only by the generality of the results obtained in that case .",
    "the approach to the equilibrium state as @xmath183 is particularly interesting because it is related to the speed of evolution , i.e. , how long it takes for a random sequence to reach the global maximum of a rugged fitness landscape .",
    "in contrast with the finite - time dynamics described before , the results of the asymptotic analysis do not depend on the specific value of the fitness of the initial configuration .",

    "the maximum speed is obtained by setting @xmath193 ( or @xmath197 ) which amounts to taking a vanishingly small mutation rate .",

    "equating these results yields @xmath254 so that the minimum time to reach the optimal fitness situation is @xmath255 this expression is valid only in the limits @xmath256 and @xmath257 .",
    "most of the techniques from statistical mechanics employed in the study of evolutionary models , such as eigen s quasispecies model , are manageable only in the stationary regime @xmath154 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "although the equilibrium analysis provides valuable insights into the behavior of these models , a complete study of the dynamics is indispensable as evolution is all about species dynamics , after all .    in this contribution we present an exact solution for the evolutionary dynamics in an extremely rugged fitness landscape ,",
    "derrida s random energy model ( rem ) @xcite .",
    "the evolutionary model studied is the quasispecies model with a parallel mutation - selection scheme , in which mutations are decoupled from replication @xcite .",
    "this scheme can be mapped in ising quantum chain in a transverse field @xcite , and the dynamics can be solved using the suzuki - trotter formalism as done in the case of the single - peak ( sp ) landscape @xcite .",
    "in fact , the similarity between the sp and rem - like fitness landscapes regarding their steady - state distributions ",
    "they are identical within the accuracy @xmath258  is well - known @xcite , and here we explore it to derive the evolutionary dynamics on the rem landscape using the sp landscape results .",
    "the ( infinite ) population is initially homogeneous , i.e. , all sequences are identical to a reference sequence chosen such that its overlap with the highest - fitness sequence is zero .",
    "in addition , most of our results are based on the assumption that the fitness of this reference sequence is negative .",
    "we note that in the parallel mutation - selection scheme , we have a malthusian fitness which basically measures the difference between the reproduction and death rates , and so can take on positive and negative values as well .    at each time",
    "@xmath0 , the population is characterized by the average overlap with the reference sequence @xmath85 as well as by the mean fitness @xmath259 .",
    "as expected , in the case the initial configuration has low fitness ( i.e. , the fitness value is less than the mutation rate per site @xmath18 ) , the dynamics for small @xmath0 corresponds to a random drift in the sequence space with @xmath46 decreasing exponentially with increasing @xmath0 [ see eq .",
    "( [ m_d ] ) ] .",
    "selection , which encodes information in the fitness landscape , has no role in the diffusive regime .",
    "we find , quite remarkably , that @xmath46 undergoes a discontinuous transition at some finite @xmath260 ( see fig .",
    "[ rem:1 ] ) when the dynamics enters a spin - glass regime in which @xmath46 vanishes as @xmath1 for large @xmath0 . as opposed to the sp landscape ( and to the ferromagnetic version of rem ; see below ) , the dynamics needs an infinite time to reach the regions close to optimal fitness sequence .",
    "when the initial configuration already has high fitness ( i.e. , the fitness value is greater than @xmath18 ) the diffusive regime is replaced by a pattern of stasis : the dynamics freezes at the initial configuration ( i.e. , @xmath261 and @xmath178 ) for a certain length of time @xmath262 where @xmath263 and then undergoes a discontinuous transition to the spin - glass regime .",
    "in addition to the rem fitness landscape , we considered also the somewhat more realistic ferromagnetic - rem landscape which , as it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ f_coup ] ) , can be viewed as a simple combination of the rem and sp fitness landscapes .",
    "for some parameter settings ( see fig .",
    "[ fem:1 ] ) , we find three distinct dynamic regimes : the diffusive , spin - glass and the ferromagnetic regimes .",
    "the transitions between these regimes are signaled by discontinuities of the overlap as well as of the mean fitness . in a parameter setting such that the equilibrium phase is the ferromagnetic one , the time to reach the optimal sequence is finite , as in the sp case , but diverges near the ( equilibrium ) transition points .",
    "as in the case of the ordinary rem , the diffusive regime is replaced by stasis when the initial configuration has a high fitness value .",
    "the discontinuous transitions between the different dynamic regimes are similar to the punctuations , during which evolution proceeds very rapidly , observed in finite population simulations @xcite .",
    "in fact , one of the first theoretical models to reproduce the punctuated equilibrium phenomenon made explicit use of the effect of random genetic drift , which results from the finitude of the population , to promote the transition between alternative fitness peaks @xcite .",
    "since our results were derived within the infinite - population assumption , this process can not be responsible for the observed punctuations .",
    "alternatively , punctuations are predicted by models in which initially low frequency beneficial mutation becomes dominant in a few generations after a certain frequency threshold is overcome @xcite .",
    "this is the process responsible for the punctuations observed in our model as well as in microbial population experiments @xcite .",
    "the infinite size population assumption behind the quasispecies - like evolution model considered here is a theoretical approximation only , and finite population size effects are undoubtedly important .",
    "the discrete - time evolutionary dynamics on a rem - like fitness landscape has been extensively investigated in the literature for the finite population case @xcite .",
    "analytical approximations and numerical simulations have yielded many interesting results about record statistics and crossover transitions .",
    "we note , however , that the exact solution of the deterministic model exhibits a much richer dynamical structure . it would be interesting to see whether there are any vestiges of the discontinuous transitions in the case of finite but large populations and , in particular , how the coalescent time statistics are affected by these regime changes @xcite .    while our main interest is the investigation of the evolutionary dynamics , our results bear on information theory as well @xcite , as they can be viewed as the exact analytical solution for the decoding process ( relaxation to the ferromagnetic configuration ) of optimal codes @xcite .",
    "in particular , we conjecture that eq .",
    "( [ tmin ] ) is universal for some classes of dynamics near the error threshold - like transitions .",
    "in fact , the connection of evolution models with information theory was first pointed out by eigen , who actually used information theoretical arguments to derive an expression for the error threshold in the sp landscapes @xcite .",
    "more recently , the relation between molecular biology and information theory was discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in general , almost any fitness landscape can be qualitatively identified with one of three classes : ferromagnetic , spin - glass and ferromagnetic spin - glass like . the first class , which exhibits a finite relaxation time to the optimum , seems too simplistic to bear on real biological situations . the spin - glass fitness landscape , on the other hand , exhibits an infinite relaxation time to the optimum , which then could never be reached by the evolutionary dynamics . the third class , which combines the complexity of the spin - glass landscape with a finite relaxation time , seems to be the preferable one from the evolutionary perspective",
    "thus natural selection seems to choose the type of fitness landscape that works more efficiently as an information processing system .",
    "the picture that emerges from computer experiments with digital organisms @xcite resembles the case of sg fitness case .",
    "although this random macroevolution scenario may be described by a spin - glass fitness landscape , nature s preference seems to be for the ferromagnetic spin - glass landscape , as manifested , for example , by protein evolution .",
    "in fact , it is known that proteins differ substantially from random heteropolymers , and that random heteropolymers can be described by the ordinary rem , whereas biological polymers are described quite well by the ferromagnetic rem @xcite .",
    "hence the genome , which codes the information to assemble the proteins , reveals ferromagnetic or ferromagnetic spin - glass like fitness landscape .",
    "this is close to the idea of channels in evolution @xcite . during the evolution , there are large rearrangements of the genome , in addition to the point substitutions considered here .",
    "this large transpositions resemble the multi - scale optimization in computer science : perhaps nature takes advantage of large gene rearrangements , whenever the search for new optimum by means of simple substitutions becomes too slow @xcite .",
    "these large events , as well as the simultaneous point mutations in two or three adjacent sites , are permitted because they practically do not affect the error threshold , while the evolution dynamics changes drastically , e.g. , a relaxation time of about @xmath264 years in the case of single point mutations is reduced to 100 years when triplet adjacent mutations are allowed @xcite .",
    "we note that simultaneous mutations in two or three random sites yield the same slow relaxation as in the case of a single point substitution .    in the theory of computation ,",
    "optimization problems are classified as polynomially solvable if the relaxation time to the optimum scales with some power of the problem size , and as np - complete or as np - hard otherwise , i.e. , when the relaxation time scales exponentially with the problem size @xcite .",
    "hence the channel - like evolution schemes are not only ferromagnetic - type fitness , but also resemble the fast computational schemes of polynomial class .",

    "<S> the parallel mutation - selection evolutionary dynamics , in which mutation and replication are independent events , is solved exactly in the case that the malthusian fitnesses associated to the genomes are described by the random energy model ( rem ) and by a ferromagnetic version of the rem . </S>",
    "<S> the solution method uses the mapping of the evolutionary dynamics into a quantum ising chain in a transverse field and the suzuki - trotter formalism to calculate the transition probabilities between configurations at different times . </S>",
    "<S> we find that in the case of the rem landscape the dynamics can exhibit three distinct regimes : pure diffusion or stasis for short times , depending on the fitness of the initial configuration , and a spin - glass regime for large times . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamic transition between these dynamical regimes is marked by discontinuities in the mean - fitness as well as in the overlap with the initial reference sequence . </S>",
    "<S> the relaxation to equilibrium is described by an inverse time decay . in the ferromagnetic rem </S>",
    "<S> , we find in addition to these three regimes , a ferromagnetic regime where the overlap and the mean - fitness are frozen . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the system relaxes to equilibrium in a finite time . </S>",
    "<S> the relevance of our results to information processing aspects of evolution is discussed . </S>"
