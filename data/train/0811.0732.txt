    "the two - body dirac equations we discuss in this paper are based on dirac s constraint formalism and a minimal interaction structure for two particles in relative motion , first used by todorov @xcite and confirmed by both classical @xcite and quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "the constraint approach gives more than a sophisticated method for guessing relativistic wave equations for systems of bound quarks or general fermion - anti - fermion systems , since it can be readily combined with the field - theoretic machinery of the bethe - salpeter equation . when used with the kernel of the bethe - salpeter equation for qed , it combines weak - potential agreement in qed @xcite with the nonperturbative structure of the field - theoretic eikonal approximation @xcite .",
    "the minimal interaction structure is then automatically inherited from relativistic classical @xcite and quantum field theory @xcite .    as has been demonstrated earlier ,",
    "the constraint equations correspond to a quantum - mechanical transform  @xcite of the bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) .",
    "this is provided by the two coupled dirac equations whose fully covariant interactions are determined by qed in the feynman gauge @xcite . unlike most other truncations of the bethe - salpeter equation , the constraint approach does not require the use of the awkward coulomb gauge ( whose noncovariant nature does not allow its incorporation in covariant equations ) .",
    "instead , its expansion about the bse naturally occurs in the covariant feynman gauge and is free from spurious infrared singularities that occur in the other approaches when that gauge is used @xcite .    in qcd with flavor - independent interactions this formalism leads to spectral results in very good agreement with most of the experimental meson spectra , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 are not included ] . at the same time ,",
    "as stressed in a recent publication @xcite , the formalism naturally accounts for the perturbative results of qed bound states , when treated in a nonperturbative manner .",
    "so far this has not been fully replicated in any other approach . in a natural way it leads not only to good singlet - triplet state splittings for the light as well as heavy mesons , but also to a goldstone behavior for the pion . by this",
    "we mean that the numerically computed pion mass tends to zero when the quark mass tends to zero .",
    "this is tied to the same relativistic structures that account for the nonperturbative positronium and muonium results @xcite .",
    "the relativistic two - body dirac equations may be written as an effective one - body wave equation @xcite .",
    "the proper formulation of this relativistic scheme requires the successful treatment ( that is a covariant elimination ) of the quantum ghost states ( due to the presence of the relative time ) that first appeared in nakanishi s work on the bethe - salpeter equation @xcite .",
    "these coupled constraint equations , known as the two body dirac equations ( tbde ) , have the following important characteristics .",
    "firstly , in the special limit in which one of the particle masses becomes infinite , the equations reduce to the ( one - body ) dirac equation .",
    "secondly , in the general case the pauli reduction of the tbde leads to a relativistic schrdinger equation , which is the same as the non - relativistic schrdinger equation in form but is relativistic in content , including all relativistic spin and relativistic kinematics .",
    "it displays various spin - spin , spin - orbit , tensor and darwin terms with energy - dependent denominators .",
    "relativistic kinematics have been properly taken into account to give a relation between the eigenvalue of the relativistic schrdinger equation and the invariant mass of the composite system .",
    "we explore several related questions in this paper .",
    "how is it that the tbde or its equivalent relativistic schrdinger equation leads to a goldstone - like behavior of the pion ?",
    "how does this approach bypass many of the singularities that appear in the effective potentials in other approaches without the necessity for introducing cutoff parameters ? a more complete understanding of how the tbde are able to accomplish this not only will aid in a better understanding of its success in meson spectroscopy but will assist us in its application to two - body bound states in other environments such as those in a strongly - coupled quark gluon plasma .    in the application of tbde to qed and qcd bound state problems ,",
    "the interaction includes coulomb - type potentials which lead naively in other approaches to singular relativistic corrections at short distances ( delta functions and potentials more attractive than @xmath8 ) that require the introduction of either perturbative treatments or smoothing parameters . in the weak potential limit in which the potential is regarded as small compared with the masses and center of momentum ( c.m . )",
    "energy , the effective potentials of the relativistic schrdinger equation , obtained from the pauli reduction of the tbde also displays these types of singular potentials .",
    "however , as we shall see these potentials become nonsingular when one uses the strong potential form in which one does not ignore the potential compared with the masses and c.m.energy .",
    "nevertheless , the potential of the triplet system , @xmath9 , with @xmath0 and @xmath10 and @xmath11 , remains much more pernicious as the potential retains its singular behavior independent of whether one regards the potential as weak or strong .",
    "we would like to describe here these unusual singularity structures in the potential and show how the tbde formalism leads to wave function solutions that are nonetheless well - behaved and physically acceptable , when the full couplings of the system are taken into account singularity structures that occur in the breit equation do not appear in the tbde @xcite . ] .",
    "in addition to our investigation of the singularity structures in tbde , we also wish to test a simplified qcd based potential for future applications .",
    "previous studies of the tbde @xcite made use of the qcd based alder - piran potential @xcite giving a quite successful description for various @xmath12 states .",
    "the adler - piran potential contains functions with many terms and parameters divided into different sections of the spatial region . on the other hand , simple potentials such as the cornell potential @xcite appears to be adequate for many applications , although lacking in asymptotic freedom .",
    "it is therefore desirable to seek a simplified potential similar to the cornell potential , but one containing asymptotic freedom that can be easily modified for future application of the tbde in other quarkonium problems .",
    "one such application is on the stability of @xmath12 states in the quark - gluon plasma which consists of quarks and antiquarks of different flavors , and gluons .",
    "the degree to which the constituents of a qgp can combine to form composite entities is an important property of the plasma .    to facilitate the application of the tbde in terms of the equivalent relativistic schrdinger equation",
    ", we present relevant useful details to indicate how various darwin and spin - dependent potential terms can be constructed in appendix c. once the various terms of the potential have been constructed , the solution of bound states problems in the tbde is mathematically just as simple as the solution for bound state problems in non - relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "accordingly , we begin in sec .",
    "ii with a discussion of the most often cited qcd potentials ( including a simplified model for the qcd potentials to be used for the first time in this paper in conjunction with the tbde for meson spectroscopy ) .",
    "it is well known how a naive use of coulomb - type potential leads to singularity problems when one introduces relativistic spin - spin corrections .",
    "how we avoid these problems in the tbde is the next question considered . in sec .",
    "iii , we seek out first how these problems are avoided in the dirac equation for an external coulomb potential .",
    "this allows us to explore in sec .",
    "iv the parallels between the singularity structures that occur in the dirac and tbde and how they each connect the different structures of the weak - potential ( or perturbative ) and strong - potential ( or nonperturbative ) forms of the two sets of equations . those different structures ,",
    "although requiring different treatments , give the same spectral results . by this",
    "we mean that a perturbative treatment of the weak - potential forms gives the same spectral results as a nonperturbative ( analytic or numerical ) treatment of the strong - potential or nonperturbative forms of the two sets of the equations .",
    "the example we use in sec .",
    "v for this parallel discussion is the tbde for electromagnetic interactions , qed . in sec .",
    "vi we discuss the spectral results , focusing on the pion , the @xmath13 , and the singularity structure of the tbde for a simplified qcd potential model in the case of @xmath14-@xmath15 or more generally @xmath16 $ ] -@xmath17 $ ]  mixing . in sec .",
    "vii we summarize the results and discuss questions that may arise when attempts are made to apply the tbde to two - body bound states in a qgp .",
    "previously , the authors of @xcite used a sophisticated form of the static quark potential developed by adler and piran @xcite , one that has ties at all length scales to field theoretic data . very good agreement with experimental quarkonium spectrum was obtained . on the other hand , in nonrelativistic treatments",
    "the most commonly used static quark potential for potential model studies is the cornell potential @xcite , @xmath18 as in @xcite .",
    "although not displaying asymptotic freedom , it does give the dominant coulomb - like behavior as well as the linear quark confinement .",
    "early on a model was proposed by richardson for a static potential which a ) depends only a single scale size @xmath19 , and b ) interpolates in a simple way between asymptotic freedom and linear confinement @xcite .",
    "richardson s model for the static interquark potential in momentum space is @xmath20 arising from the assumption that   @xmath21 ( including the color factor @xmath22 ) .",
    "asymptotic freedom requires that for @xmath23 @xmath24 on the other hand , the property of linear confinement requires that for @xmath25 @xmath26 or equivalently that for @xmath27 one must impose @xmath28 .",
    "the interpolation of eq .",
    "( [ rcr ] ) is not tied at all in the intermediate region and only roughly tied in the large @xmath29 region to any field theoretic data .",
    "nevertheless it provides a convenient one - parameter form for the static quark potential .  in coordinate space",
    "it has the form @xmath30 where @xmath31 is given by a complicated integral transform that displays the asymptotic freedom behavior for @xmath32 of @xmath33 while for @xmath34 @xmath35  a simpler model , which we will apply in this paper and one which displays the same large and small @xmath29 behavior is ]   @xmath36 it amounts to replacing richardson s @xmath31 by @xmath37 having the same limits .",
    "although not giving as good a fit to the spectra as the more closely tied qcd based potential of @xcite , the modified form of  eq .",
    "( [ rrich ] ) which we use in this paper ( see eq .",
    "( [ rricha ] ) below ) does provide reasonable results for the spectrum .",
    "furthermore its linear - plus - coulomb - type parametrization is more convenient for extension of the quark model to high temperature environments .",
    "problems arise in the quark model with the above potentials if their relativistic corrections are naively grafted from semirelativistic expressions .",
    "for example , the spin - spin interaction @xmath38 would lead to a singular delta function potential that can only be treated perturbatively .",
    "some approaches simply include cutoff parameters so that the laplacian is not singular .",
    "how do the tbde treat this problem ?",
    "potential energy terms such as the above arise from the second order reductions of those equations ( the pauli forms ) .",
    "let us first examine how such problems are treated in a very natural way in the schrdinger pauli - form of dirac s original wave equation .",
    "the @xmath39-@xmath40 interaction in eq .  ( [ rrich ] ) contains the color - coulomb term that is proportional to @xmath41 and a logarithmic function of @xmath29 .",
    "it leads naively to singular relativistic corrections that may render the solution singular at short distances .",
    "it is worth while to investigate coulomb - type potential in relativistic equations .",
    "let us be more precise in our definitions of singular potentials .",
    "case @xcite describes how potentials that are more attractive at the origin than @xmath42 must be adjusted to maintain their self - adjoint status .",
    "let us call such potentials , attractive singular potentials .",
    "they include attractive delta functions and attractive @xmath43 potentials that appear in spin - orbit terms . such terms must either be treated only in perturbation theory or in cases where the coupling is strong , require adjustments , e.g. by smoothing parameters .",
    "calogero @xcite and frank @xmath44 @xcite also discuss another category of potentials called repulsive singular potentials .",
    "these are repulsive potentials that exceed an inverse quadratic power law behavior . strictly speaking they need not be treated using perturbation theory ,",
    "although in the case of weak potentials they are most easily treated like that .",
    "we will discuss these more in the context below .",
    "let us show how the pauli - form of the dirac equation with a coulomb - type interaction contains effective potentials that are repulsively singular , when viewed in an incomplete or perturbative context .",
    "however , when viewed in a complete or nonperturbative context the effective potentials are nonetheless nonsingular .",
    "we examine for simplicity the case of the dirac equation in a coulomb potential ( @xmath45 ) ( instead of the more complicated forms with asymptotic freedom ) for stationary states ,   @xmath46 then with @xmath47 we have @xmath48 eliminating @xmath49 we obtain @xmath50 leading to @xmath51\\phi",

    "if one takes the weak potential limit in which the denominators in the three succeeding terms are replaced by @xmath58 then the spin - orbit potential is an attractive singular potential for both coupling states and must be handled by perturbative techniques .  under weak potential circumstances the delta function potential",
    "would be treated by perturbative techniques .",
    "since it is repulsive , one could , in principle treat it in a nonperturbative way .",
    "it has been shown , however @xcite , that a nonperturbative treatment of repulsive delta functions potentials produce no effect on bound state energies .",
    "the repulsive @xmath59 term would require special numerical treatments ( its perturbative effects on @xmath2-states is ill - defined ) .",
    "let us now compare perturbative and nonperturbative treatments of this pauli form .    by using the atomic units @xmath60 the above equation takes the dimensionless",

    "note that we have left out here the @xmath69 term in eq .",
    "( [ coul ] ) since it , together with the coulomb potential in the denominator would yield a vanishing result for its contribution ( its expectation value in any well - behaved basis would give zero ) .",

    "a set of straight - forward but tedious manipulations show how this comes about .",
    "we first point out that the @xmath71 term in eq .",
    "( [ coul ] ) has a short distance behavior of that of a repulsive @xmath72 behavior that is lower order in @xmath73 , so unlike its weak potential @xmath59 form it is not in the category of a repulsive singular potential .",

    "the above exercise shows that what appears as singular in a perturbative context turns out in fact to be non - singular in a full non - perturbative treatment . for our case of the ground state ,",
    "the two approaches give the same result up to order @xmath62 , using different parts of the effective interaction .",
    "does this extend to the radially and orbitally excited states ?",

    "although we have not shown this here , it is expected to be true since the exact ( nonperturbative ) pauli form should faithfully reproduce the exact spectral results of the first order form of the dirac equation .",

    "this is in contrast to what occurs in the singlet case where there is the mildly singular behavior or in the nonrelativistic case where the behavior is flat .",
    "also , whereas an upper bound of @xmath154 is placed on the coupling in the singlet case , here the upper bound is @xmath155 for well - behaved wave functions .",
    "the unusual dips of the @xmath2- and @xmath3-wave functions for qed also shows up in numerical solution of the qcd case , as will be seen in figs .  3 and 4 .",

    "the authors of @xcite found that the fit provided by the two - body dirac model for the entire meson spectrum competes with the best fits to partial spectra provided by the others and does so with a smaller number of interaction functions .",
    "furthermore this is done without additional cutoff parameters necessary to make some of the other approaches numerically tractable .    in this section",
    "we examine the spectral results produced by a relativistic version of a simpler model motivated by the static quark potential of richardson @xcite .",
    "it is not our purpose here to improve upon the results of @xcite but rather to take advantage of the simpler structure of the model to explore certain details of the effective potential and wave function behaviors generated by the tbde along the lines discussed in the above sections for qed .",
    "this will also allow us to more readily make changes in the invariants @xmath170 and @xmath171 determined from this simpler model to facilitate investigations on quarkonium stability in the presence of a quark - gluon plasma .",
    "for our potential model we consider here a slightly more generalized form of eq .",
