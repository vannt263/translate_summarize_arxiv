    "at a phenomenological level , the experimental data for the complex susceptibility @xmath0 are fitted by taking for each line a contribution of the form @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the line frequency , @xmath3 is related to its width and @xmath4 to its intensity .",
    "this formula was originally obtained by thinking of each line as corresponding to a `` physical '' microscopic dipole oscillating with frequency @xmath2 and with a damping characterized by the constant @xmath3 . in the literature",
    "this is often referred to as the `` lorentz model '' .",
    "however , some difficulties arise in connection with the imaginary part of the complex susceptibility , which , in the transparency region of dielectrics , dictates the behavior of the extinction coefficient @xmath5 .",
    "is related to the extinction coefficient @xmath5 and the refractive index @xmath6 by @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "so , in the region in which the dielectric is transparent , i.e. , where @xmath6 is approximately constant , the behavior of @xmath9 determines the behavior of @xmath5.[foot:1 ] ] in fact , it is known since the seventies that for dielectrics , in the region of high transparency , the lorentz formula ( [ eq:1 ] ) provides for the extinction coefficient not only a too large value ( by orders of magnitude ) , but also a qualitatively incorrect behavior .    indeed ,",
    "relation ( [ eq:1 ] ) gives , for the imaginary part , @xmath10 which reduces to the well known lorentz formula @xmath11 for frequencies near the absorption peak , @xmath12 .",
    "so , formula ( [ eq:1im ] ) predicts that the extinction coefficient decreases as @xmath13 for large @xmath14 , whereas , in the transparency region , i.e. , for @xmath15 , the measured values of the extinction coefficient ( see @xcite ) exhibit a decay which is exponential rather than as an inverse power of @xmath14 . in the literature",
    "( see @xcite ) one finds involved ab initio computations which reproduce quite well the experimental findings , but a simple general reason for the observed behavior is lacking .",
    "in this paper we propose an explanation of the observed exponential decay of the extinction coefficient , as due to the fact that the time auto  correlation of polarization should be an analytic function of time .",
    "we also propose a simple phenomenological formula which should be substituted for the lorentz one , in order to describe the exponential decay of the experimental data .",
    "such a formula involves the asymptotic ( in time ) behavior of the time auto  correlation of polarization , as described below . in section  [ sez : secante ]",
    "the theoretical argument is presented and the corresponding proposed formula is given . in section  [ sez :",
    "fit ] a quantitative check of the proposed formula is performed , by fitting the experimental data for three dielectrics ( , , ) over a very large interval of frequencies in the infrared region . in the last section  [ sez : com ]",
    "some comments are added , in particular concerning the relaxation of the correlations of polarization .",
    "in modern terms , the lorentz law ( [ eq:1 ] ) can be justified through linear response theory as follows .",
    "the susceptibility is nothing but the fourier transform of the time correlation of polarization . in formul",
    ", one has @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the system polarization and the brackets denote a suitable average ( for example the canonical one ) .",
    "now , the classical formula ( [ eq:1 ] ) is obtained simply by integration if one supposes that the correlation decays exponentially for @xmath18 as a damped sinusoid , i.e. , as proportional to @xmath19 however , if at first sight such expression for the correlation can appear physically sound , one has to recall that the correlation @xmath20 is an odd function of time ( because it is the derivative of the correlation @xmath21 , which has to be even ) .",
    "thus the correct expression should rather be @xmath22 which is * not * an analytic function of time , due to the presence of @xmath23 in the argument of the exponential .",
    "this rather abstract remark immediately implies that the imaginary part of susceptibility , and thus the extinction coefficient , can not decay exponentially if the correlation has the form ( [ eq : corr_nonanalitica ] ) .",
    "in fact , from ( [ eq : def_chi ] ) one has @xmath24 which shows that the extinction coefficient decays exponentially if and only if @xmath25 is analytic as a function of time .    on the other hand",
    ", there is no reason for the appearance of a singularity at @xmath26 in the expression of the correlation , and it seems instead natural to suppose that @xmath27 should be taken as an analytic function .",
    "so the problem is now reduced to finding a simple analytic function which is odd and decays exponentially .",
    "one should however take into account the fact that @xmath20 is a correlation , in particular the derivative of the time auto ",
    "correlation @xmath21 , which is a positive  definite function ( in the sense of bochner , see @xcite , p. 17 ) .",
    "this apparently abstract mathematical requirement in particular implies that the extinction coefficient be positive at all frequencies , is positive  definite , one has @xmath28 with @xmath29 , @xmath30 , in virtue of bochner theorem . then , @xmath31 so that @xmath32 with a suitable constant @xmath33 , and so @xmath34 is positive for @xmath35 . ] a very sound physical constraint indeed .",

    "the first one is that our procedure to determine the parameters , which involves only the imaginary part of susceptibility given by expression ( [ eq:2n ] ) , was just that of trial and error . in other terms",
    ", we find by hands some values of the parameters which , in our opinion , give acceptable fits for the experimental data over a large range of values of @xmath71 ( nine orders of magnitude ) . *",
    "no * procedure of error minimization , nor any statistical test , are used to check the quality of the fit .",
    "this in particular implies that also the number of terms @xmath63 in the sum is taken in a sense in an arbitrary way .",
    "this point will be discussed below .",
    "the data of the real part of susceptibility , which do not enter the fit , are then used for determining the constant @xmath65 .",
    "the second remark is that most of the `` experimental data '' in the region of the `` peaks '' , are not experimental at all , because in such a region neither the extinction coefficient nor the refractive index can be actually measured .",
    "they are actually inferred from other measured quantities ( such as the reflectivity ) assuming that susceptibility can be described in a fairly good way by the lorentz model .",
    "this is particularly evident in figure  [ fig : lif ] , in which two sets of data are present in the region between 800 @xmath72 and 1000 @xmath72 .",
    "the set of values which presents an exponential decay corresponds to the directly measured values of @xmath5 , while the other one contains the values which are inferred from reflectivity measurements .    in view of these two remarks",
    ", we expect that the overall accuracy of the fits would be improved is a reprocessing were performed of the experimental data , in the spectral region where the extinction coefficient and the refractive index are not directly measurable .",
    "we discuss here the problem of the number @xmath63 of terms to be used in the expression ( [ eq : fit ] ) for the fit of the imaginary part of susceptibility .",
    "naively , one might expect @xmath63 to be equal to the number of most `` evident '' lines , but actually a larger number of terms is needed : in particular ( as shown by table  [ tab:1 ] ) five terms are needed to match the data for , six for and seven for .",
    "for example , in order to have a good global fit three different terms have to be associated to the line at @xmath73 @xmath72 , all with the same frequency , but with three well different damping constants .",
    "something analogous occurs for the line at about 160 @xmath72 and for the line at about 245 @xmath72 , for which several terms of very near frequencies are needed , with however different values of @xmath3 .",
    "this can be interpreted by saying that several time ",
    "scales are involved in the decay of the relevant correlations , so that the relaxation of the correlations is a much more complicated process than just a simple exponential decay .",
    "this is a well known fact in other fields , for example in glasses ( see @xcite ) , or in relaxation spectroscopy ( see for example @xcite ) , which involve the behavior of susceptibility at low frequencies ( in the micro - waves region ) , where continuous distributions of relaxation times are actually used .",
    "so our result could be read as a hint that , also in the infrared region , the process of the decay of correlations is a complicated one . and indeed , the numerical evidence in some cases seems to support this view .",
    "we refer to computations performed by us in the case of a one component model of plasma , see @xcite , and of a model of crystal , see @xcite . in any case , more work is needed to set this point .",
