    "one of the puzzling and intriguing phenomena in type - ii superconductors is the sign change in the hall effect near the mean - field transition at the upper critical field @xmath2 .",
    "such a hall anomaly has been observed in some conventional low-@xmath4 superconductors , such as moderately disordered nb and v @xcite and amorphous mosi @xcite and moge @xcite films , as well as most high-@xmath4 superconductors ( htsc ) @xcite .",
    "hagen et al .",
    "@xcite pointed out the importance of the electron mean - free path for the hall anomaly and concluded that very clean and very dirty materials do not show hall anomalies .",
    "however , studies on amorphous dirty superconductors contradict this conclusion @xcite .",
    "recent phenomenological approaches based on the time - dependent ginzburg - landau ( tdgl ) equation have qualitatively explained the sign anomaly @xcite . in these theories ,",
    "the sign reversal is just a consequence of the difference in sign between the normal ( or quasiparticle ) term and the superconducting fluctuation ( or vortex flow ) term of the hall conductivity .",
    "several authors @xcite have derived the sign of the fluctuation ( vortex flow ) term from the tdgl equation for bcs superconductors .",
    "recent experimental studies on htscs @xcite have pointed out that the sign predictions of these theories are not correct for htscs , but they should be valid for bcs superconductors .    even if the sign of the hall fluctuation conductivity were clear , its temperature and field dependence is a matter of discussion .",
    "recent experimental studies on yba@xmath5cu@xmath6o@xmath7 films @xcite and single - crystalline bi@xmath5sr@xmath5cacu@xmath5o@xmath8 and bi@xmath9sr@xmath10la@xmath11cuo@xmath12 @xcite have observed that the sign change takes place above @xmath2 , while other studies have claimed that the sign anomaly takes place below @xmath2 . in this problem ,",
    "the definition of @xmath2 as well as the temperature and field dependence of the hall fluctuation conductivity is very important .",
    "as reported in conventional amorphous films @xcite as well as htscs , the longitudinal conductivity in a perpendicular magnetic field shows a smooth crossover from the paraconducting regime to flux flow regime around @xmath2 , which is strikingly different from the picture of the conventional fluctuation theory in which the conductivity due to the direct fluctuation contributions of the aslamazov - larkin ( al ) process diverges at @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "thus , it was difficult to define @xmath2 correctly from the fluctuation theory .",
    "recent tdgl theories @xcite , however , have successfully explained the smooth crossover around @xmath2 by taking into account the interaction term of superconducting fluctuations of the al process within the hartree approximation .",
    "later , ullah and dorsey ( ud ) @xcite developed this further and proposed a scaling theory for the longitudinal and hall conductivities .",
    "this scaling approach is very useful to determine @xmath2 correctly and to describe the field and temperature dependence of the conductivities .    in this paper",
    ", we present measurements and analysis of the longitudinal and hall resistivities @xmath13 and @xmath14 for thin amorphous ( a- ) nb@xmath0ge@xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) films ( @xmath17 ) according to the tdgl theories .",
    "we confirm that the smooth crossover in the longitudinal conductivity around @xmath2 is well explained by the ud scaling theory as was found previously @xcite , and determine @xmath2 .",
    "we then show that for the thinner films the sign change in the hall conductivity takes place above @xmath2 .",
    "contrary to results on htscs , we show that the sign of the hall conductivity is consistent with the tdgl theory for bcs superconductors .",
    "we discuss the origin of the sign reversal observed here .",
    "the films used in this study were deposited by rf sputtering on si substrates held at room temperature in a system with a base pressure of @xmath18 mbar , using @xmath19 mbar ar gas as a sputtering gas .",
    "the thickness as used were 16 , 34 , 60 and 163 nm .",
    "x - ray diffraction showed the films to be amorphous .",
    "the average composition for each film was determined by electron microprobe analysis .",
    "the distribution in the composition @xmath20 is less than @xmath21 .",
    "the superconducting mean - field transition temperature in zero field , @xmath4 , was determined from the temperature dependence of resistivity by using the al fluctuation theory @xcite . from a previous systematic study on a - nb@xmath0ge@xmath15 films @xcite , the distribution of @xmath4 due to @xmath22 is estimated to be less than 18mk ( @xmath23 ) around @xmath24 . except for the film thickness ,",
    "these films have the following identical parameters ; the average composition @xmath25 0.3 , @xmath26 3k , the normal state resistivity @xmath27 m , @xmath28 t / k , the gl coherence length at @xmath29=0 @xmath30 nm and the gl parameter for dirty limit @xmath3175 .",
    "these films were ion - etched in 200@xmath32 m wide strips with 8 voltage and 2 current contacts .",
    "the longitudinal and hall resistivities are measured by a conventional dc four - probe method . the longitudinal component due to the misalignment in the hall probes",
    "was subtracted by reversing the field direction .",
    "the films are immersed in liquid @xmath33he to obtain good thermal contact .",
    "the magnetic field is normal to the film surface .",
    "the normal resistivity @xmath34 in the temperature range of 1.5 k@xmath35 5 k has a small temperature coefficient @xmath36 k@xmath37 .",
    "in this study , @xmath38 and @xmath39 were measured as a function of @xmath40 ( @xmath418 t ) at various @xmath29 .",
    "figures 1 ( a ) and ( b ) show the field dependence of the longitudinal @xmath42 and hall conductivities @xmath43 at different @xmath29 for the 34 nm thick film with @xmath4=2.77k . to reduce the effect of pinning in the mixed state , the measuring current density @xmath44 was selected to be 1 - 4@xmath4510@xmath46a / m@xmath47 which is much higher than the depinning current density @xmath48 a / m@xmath47 ) , but smaller than the depairing current density @xmath49 a / m@xmath47 ) .    far above @xmath4 ,",
    "@xmath50 is field independent while @xmath51 is directly proportional to @xmath40 , that is , the normal state hall effect appears .",
    "the normal state hall conductivity @xmath52 has a positive sign . within the drude model , the normal state hall angle , @xmath53 ,",
    "is given by    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is the cyclotron frequency and @xmath56 is the elastic scattering time of electrons . compared with typical result on htscs ( @xmath57 at @xmath58 t ) ,",
    "the present films have very small value of @xmath59 at @xmath58 t , indicating the very small mean - free path to be expected for amorphous metals .    near and below @xmath4 one",
    "can clearly see that @xmath51 changes sign at a certain field @xmath60 in fig.1(b ) .",
    "we do not observe any second sign change below @xmath60 , in contrast to what has been reported for several htscs @xcite .",
    "far above @xmath60 , @xmath51 recovers the direct proportionality to @xmath40 and the normal state hall effect appears again , indicating that the superconducting fluctuations are completely suppressed by magnetic field .",
    "we therefore can define @xmath52 below @xmath4 unambiguously . in order to determine @xmath2",
    ", we use the ud scaling theory . according to this theory ,",
    "the longitudinal conductivity is composed of the normal ( or quasiparticle ) term @xmath61 and superconducting fluctuation ( or vortex flow ) term @xmath62 , and expressed as @xmath63 @xmath62 interpolates smoothly from the paraconducting regime to flux flow regime around @xmath2 and obeys universal scaling functions @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the scaling function for @xmath66 .",
    "these functions depend on the dimensionality governed by the ratio of the film thickness @xmath67 and the length scale @xmath68 for fluctuations of the order parameter near @xmath2 . for the thickness of the films in this study we can apply two - dimensional ( 2d ) scaling functions @xcite . at each @xmath29",
    "we identify @xmath61 with @xmath50 taken at a field ( typically 7 t ) where @xmath51 depends linearly on field and @xmath50 is field independent .",
    "@xmath62 is obtained by subtracting @xmath61 from @xmath50 .",
    "figure 2 shows a typical scaling result . here",
    ", the data are plotted above @xmath69 where the lowest landau level ( lll ) approximation for the scaling functions is valid @xcite .",
    "one can clearly see that the scaled longitudinal fluctuation conductivity @xmath70 collapses on two universal curves @xmath64 as a function of the scaled field @xmath71 given by @xmath72 , with @xmath73 , although deviations are visible at large @xmath74 . here ,",
    "@xmath75 and @xmath76 are normalized temperature and field , respectively .",
    "@xmath77 is related to the real part of the relaxation time of the order parameter @xmath78 .",
    "we take a dirty limit value of @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "the strength of thermal fluctuations for 2d system , @xmath80 , is given by @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the ginzburg number @xcite .",
    "very close to @xmath2 , deviations due to the inhomogeneity in the composition @xmath20 become apparent .",
    "hence , we do not plot the data in fields @xmath83 , which roughly corresponds to @xmath84 .",
    "in such a scaling plot , the unknown parameters are @xmath85 and @xmath86 . in the temperature range close to @xmath4 ,",
    "they are connected by the simple relation @xmath87 .",
    "we first determine @xmath85 from the scaling collapse of the data close to @xmath4 and this @xmath85 value is used to determine @xmath2 far below @xmath4 in the scaling analysis .",
    "thus , we can unambiguously determine @xmath2 from the scaling collapse of the data .    before proceeding to the result of the @xmath2 line ,",
    "we compare the scaling functions @xmath88 with those predicted in the ud theory .",
    "the ud theory implies that the 2d universal functions @xmath89 in the high field limit are given by @xmath90 if the pinning effect in the flux flow regime is negligible and the fluctuation conductivity in the paraconducting regime is dominated by the direct fluctuation contributions of the al process .",
    "these functions are applicable to the field range where the lll is satisfied .",
    "the solid lines in fig.2(a ) denote these universal functions .",
    "@xmath88 agrees well with @xmath89 near @xmath91 ) , while deviations are visible in the large @xmath74 regime . in the paraconducting regime , @xmath92 decreases much faster than @xmath93 above @xmath94 .",
    "such a rapid decrease in @xmath62 was also observed far above @xmath2 in amorphous thick films and attributed qualitatively to a phenomenological short wavelength cutoff in the fluctuation spectrum @xcite . for the other films ( @xmath67=16 and 60 nm ) except for the thickest film ( @xmath67=163 nm ) @xcite , similar deviation of @xmath92 begins to appear at almost the same value of @xmath95 , although the physical origin of the short wavelength cutoff is not clear .",
    "the definition of @xmath61 does not affect this behavior because the field at which @xmath61 is defined is much larger than the fields of interest .",
    "hereafter , we regard @xmath96 as the phenomenological boundary below which @xmath62 is well described by the ud scaling theory , and discuss our data below this boundary .    from the scaling collapse of @xmath62 we obtained the @xmath2 line for films with different thickness . to compare those results , we plot the normalized mean - field value of @xmath97 against normalized temperature @xmath98 for different films in fig .",
    "good agreement is seen for @xmath2 of all films .",
    "the solid line represents the mean - field line for the dirty limit in the werthamer - helfand - hohenberg ( whh ) theory , which is given by @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the digamma function @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 line obtained is well approximated by this relation , giving experimental support for the validity of the ud scaling theory .",
    "next , we turn to results of the hall fluctuation conductivity . in the tdgl theories @xcite ,",
    "the hall conductivity also consists of a normal ( or quasiparticle ) term and a superconducting fluctuation ( or vortex flow ) term , @xmath101 hence , we subtract @xmath102 from @xmath103 , and plot @xmath104 against @xmath40 in fig.1(c ) .",
    "the plot shows that @xmath105 always has a negative sign .",
    "@xmath2 is denoted by the long arrows . with decreasing @xmath40",
    "the magnitude of @xmath105 increases monotonically and grows as 1/@xmath40 at low @xmath106 ( not shown ) as the tdgl theories predict @xcite .",
    "thus , the sign reversal of @xmath51 at @xmath60 always takes place when @xmath105 and @xmath52 are different in sign .",
    "beforehand it is not clear whether or not @xmath60 is above @xmath2 , because @xmath52 and @xmath105 depend in different ways on the electronic structure of the material .",
    "as one can see in fig.3 , in the thinnest film @xmath60 ( denoted as open symbols ) is always above @xmath2 but below the phenomenological boundary where scaling analysis starts to fail .",
    "it may be worth pointing out that @xmath60 decreases monotonically with rising @xmath29 and terminates finally at a certain @xmath107 above @xmath108 in zero field . with increasing @xmath67",
    ", @xmath60 moves systematically closer to @xmath2 and it finally shifts below ( but very close to ) @xmath2 for the thickest film , implying that the contribution of the negative @xmath105 to positive @xmath52 decreases with increasing @xmath67 .",
    "these results support the view that enhancing the superconducting fluctuations by reducing @xmath67 leads to an increasing negative hall conductivity working against positive @xmath52 , which is responsible for the sign reversal above @xmath2 .",
    "we now discuss the field and temperature dependence of @xmath105 , in comparison with the ud scaling theory . according to this theory , @xmath62 and @xmath105 have the same field and temperature dependence and",
    "their ratio should be independent of @xmath40 and @xmath29 .",
    "note that @xmath109 , the ratio of the imaginary and real part of @xmath110 @xcite .",
    "we did not find scaling of @xmath105 .",
    "a recent study on yba@xmath5cu@xmath6o@xmath7 films @xcite has pointed out that the failure of the scaling of @xmath105 can be attributed to the additional contributions of the mt process , which are not taken into account in the ud theory .",
    "however , the mt process can not explain the present result because the strong pair breaking effect in the amorphous dirty films should lead to a small contribution @xcite .",
    "as one can see in the inset of fig.4(a ) , contrary to the ud scaling theory ,",
    "@xmath111 at @xmath2 increases monotonically with cooling .",
    "similar temperature dependence of @xmath111 has been reported for amorphous mosi films @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the main reason for the scaling failure is the temperature dependence of @xmath112 .",
    "further microscopic calculations based on the bcs theory are required to explain this effect .",
    "the field dependence of @xmath111 is shown in fig .",
    "4 ( a ) for two current densities . in the field",
    "range @xmath113 where @xmath62 follows the ud scaling theory , @xmath111 is independent of @xmath44 and depends only weakly on @xmath71 .",
    "as one can see in fig.4 ( b ) , however , in the same field range both conductivities change almost one decade in magnitude and their dependences on @xmath71 look very similar .",
    "hence , we believe that both @xmath62 and @xmath105 in the paraconducting regime ( @xmath114 ) ) are dominated by the direct fluctuation contributions of the al process and thus the contributions of the al process are responsible for the sign change of the hall conductivity above @xmath2 .    finally , we discuss the origin of the sign in @xmath52 and @xmath105 for our amorphous films .",
    "the sign of @xmath52 depends on the sign of the group velocity @xmath115 ) of electrons at the fermi level where @xmath116 is the energy and @xmath117 is the wave number . because of the absence of band structure , the amorphous materials are generally more free - electron - like than their crystalline counterparts .",
    "therefore , the simple amorphous metals generally have negative @xmath52 because of a positive group velocity ( @xmath118 ) @xcite .",
    "most of the amorphous transition metals ( tms ) , however , have positive @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "the origin of this positive @xmath52 has been attributed to the s - d hybridization interaction in the tm , which leads to a negative group velocity ( @xmath119 ) at the fermi level if the fermi energy @xmath120 lies within the d - band @xcite .",
    "the tm - metalloid type amorphous superconductors nbge as well as moge and mosi belong to amorphous tms and have positive @xmath52 .    in the tdgl theory based on bcs superconductors by nishio and ebisawa @xcite , the sign of @xmath105 is determined by the electron - hole asymmetry , i.e. by the sign of @xmath121 , where @xmath122 is the energy derivative of the density of states ( dos ) @xmath123 at the fermi energy .",
    "numerical calculations of the dos for e.g. amorphous ni @xcite imply that the total dos near @xmath120 is dominated by the dos for the d - band whose energy dependence is characterized by a peak near the center of d - band @xmath124 and roughly approximated by a parabolic energy dependence with negative curvature , i.e. , @xmath125 .",
    "similar energy dependences of the total dos have been commonly observed for various amorphous tm - metalloid alloys by photoemission experiments @xcite .",
    "because nb is a less than half filled 4d - band metal , @xmath120 lies below the center of the 4d - band @xmath126 .",
    "thus , a - nbge films have positive @xmath127 .",
    "the same argument holds for a - moge and mosi , since mo is also a less than half filled 4d - band metal .",
    "thus , sgn@xmath128=sgn@xmath129 in both a - nbge , a - moge and a - mosi films @xcite .",
    "these findings give experimental support for the prediction of the sign of @xmath105 in the tdgl theory for bcs superconductors .",
    "in summary , we have measured the longitudinal and hall resistivities for thin films of the dirty superconductor a - nb@xmath0ge@xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) near @xmath2 .",
    "we confirm that @xmath62 obeys the 2d scaling functions of the ud fluctuation theory .",
    "we find a good agreement of the obtained @xmath2 line with the whh theory , supporting the scaling procedure .",
    "the failure of the scaling collapse of @xmath105 is attributed to the temperature dependence of @xmath112 .",
    "the hall conductivity @xmath51 in thinner films shows a sign change at a certain @xmath60 which is above @xmath2 but in the regime where @xmath50 follows the ud theory . with increasing film thickness , @xmath60 moves closer to @xmath2 and it finally shifts below ( but close to ) @xmath2 for the thickest film .",
    "the negative contribution of the superconducting fluctuations of the al process working against positive @xmath52 is responsible for the sign change above @xmath2 .",
    "the negative sign of @xmath105 in the present films is consistent with the electron - hole asymmetry in the framework of the tdgl theory for bcs superconductors .",
