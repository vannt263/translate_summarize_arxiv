    "<S> the topological charge is measured on gauge configurations generated with a renormalization group improved gauge action and a mean field improved clover quark action at three values of @xmath0 , corresponding to lattice spacings of @xmath1 , 0.16 and 0.11  fm , with four sea quark masses at each @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the study is supplemented by simulations of pure su(3 ) gauge theory with the same gauge action at 5 values of @xmath2 with lattice spacings 0.09  @xmath30.27  fm . </S>",
    "<S> we employ a field theoretic definition of the topological charge together with cooling . for the topological susceptibility in the continuum limit of pure su(3 ) gauge theory </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath4  mev where the error shows statistical and systematic ones added in quadrature . in full qcd @xmath5 at heavy sea quark masses is consistent with that of pure su(3 ) gauge theory . a decrease of @xmath5 toward light quark masses , as predicted by the anomalous ward - takahashi identity for u(1 ) chiral symmetry , becomes clearer for smaller lattice spacings . </S>",
