    "we have learned that irregular galaxies are not just small versions of spiral disks , but we do not know the intrinsic characteristics of these systems , the most common type of galaxy in the universe . indeed , the fundamental structure of irregular galaxies is still in doubt .",
    "it has been generally believed that irregular galaxies are disks like spirals , and like spirals , surface brightness profiles in most irregulars are most often adequately fit with an exponential law ( patterson & thuan 1996 ; van zee 2000 ) .",
    "however , studies of the distributions of projected minor - to - major axis ratios @xmath3 suggest that irregulars are thicker than spirals , perhaps having intrinsic flattening ratios @xmath4 of 0.30.4 rather than the 0.2 value generally adopted for spirals ( hodge & hitchcock 1966 , van den bergh 1988 , binggeli & popescu 1995 ) .",
    "staveley - smith , davies , & kinman ( 1992 ) , on the other hand , argue that the low ratio of rotation velocity to velocity dispersion often seen in irregulars must imply a thick disk with an intrinsic flattening ratio as high as 0.6 .",
    "more recently sung et al .  (",
    "1998 ) have also analyzed ellipticity distributions and concluded that dwarf irregulars and blue compact dwarfs ( bcds ) are more triaxial than disk - shaped , having axis ratios 1:0.7:0.5 and being only a little less spherical than dwarf ellipticals .",
    "what then is the true shape of irregulars ?",
    "because of these outstanding issues , we have begun a program aimed at understanding the intrinsic structure of normal irregular galaxies through determining their stellar kinematics . in this paper we present results from long - slit spectral observations of stellar absorption features in two irregular galaxies of high surface brightness .",
    "while observations of giant galaxies are often detailed enough to justify sophisticated analysis of their structure , ( see , for example , statler & fry 1994 ; statler , smecker - hane , & cecil 1996 ; statler & smecker - hane 1999 ) , observations of the stellar kinematics of irregular galaxies have been harder to obtain ( but see swaters 1999 ) .",
    "most irregular galaxies are much lower in surface brightness than giant galaxies , and they rotate much more slowly , so a higher velocity resolution is needed .",
    "thus , the signal - to - noise that is possible with current instrumentation limits what can be deduced for irregular galaxies .",
    "nevertheless , we can begin to learn about the highest surface brightness irregulars now , and expect to extend to lower surface brightness objects as long - slit spectrographs or field integrators with moderate spectral resolution become available on very large telescopes .",
    "an understanding of the shape of i m galaxies is important to understanding other aspects of these systems .",
    "a colleague of ours saw a broad - band optical picture of the irregular galaxy sextans a ( hunter 1997 ) on a bulletin board and asked why the galaxy appears square and has such sharp edges .",
    "sextans a is not alone ; other irregular galaxies also defy our expectations of what galaxies should look like .",
    "the rectangular shape of these galaxies is often taken to mean that the galaxies are barred .",
    "but , if that is the case , their bar structures are very different from those in spirals . in spirals",
    "the bar length is typically @xmath50.3 of the size of the stellar disk ( elmegreen & elmegreen 1985 ) . in the rectangular irregulars the bar is a significant fraction of the entire optical galaxy .",
    "for example , in ngc 4449 the bar has a length that is 90% of d@xmath6 , the diameter measured to a b - band surface brightness level of 25 magnitudes arcsec@xmath7 ( hunter , van woerden , & gallagher 1999 ) .",
    "what does it mean for most of the galaxy to be a bar ?",
    "there are also often peculiarities in the gas kinematics and distributions that are not evident in the optical morphology . in sextans a the velocity field of the neutral gas is not aligned with the optical axis of symmetry and there is some evidence that gas is moving on elliptical orbits ( skillman et al .",
    "1988 ) . in ngc 4449",
    "the inner gas is counter - rotating with respect to the outer gas and neither gas system is aligned with the isophotes of the optical galaxy ( hunter et al .",
    "1999 ) . however , because of its large cross - section , the gas of many irregulars could have been perturbed by outside forces over the galaxy s lifetime ( for example , ngc 4449 : hunter et al .",
    "what are the kinematics of the stellar system , which has a smaller cross - section , and how do they compare to that of the gas ?    in this paper",
    "we report results of our first observations of stellar kinematics determined from absorption spectra in the irregulars ngc 1156 and ngc 4449 .",
    "we also discuss the kinematics of the ionized gas in these two galaxies as well as in ngc 2366 .",
    "two of the galaxies in our sample are high surface brightness irregular galaxies : ngc 1156 and ngc 4449 .",
    "they have @xmath8 , the average surface brightness within d@xmath6 , of 22.4 and 22.1 , respectively .",
    "the third galaxy , ngc 2366 , is a more typical , lower surface brightness irregular ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "all three galaxies are classified as ibm , barred magellanic - type irregulars , by de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "( 1991 ; @xmath10rc3 ) .",
    "only ngc 2366 might be considered a `` dwarf '' irregular under any of the more common luminosity - based definitions adopted by authors . in table",
    "[ tabgal ] we list some global properties of the galaxies that are pertinent to our discussion . figure [ figv ] shows v - band and h@xmath11  images of each galaxy .    at an m@xmath12 of @xmath1318.0 , ngc 1156",
    "is at the high end of the range of luminosities seen in normal irregular galaxies ( hunter 1997 ) , and is about 25% brighter than the large magellanic cloud in the b - band .",
    "ngc 1156 has a modestly high rate of star formation and h@xmath14ii  regions are crowded over the disk .",
    "karachentsev , musella , & grimaldi ( 1996 ) describe ngc 1156 as `` the less [ sic ] disturbed galaxy in the local universe , '' and there are no significant galaxy neighbors within 0.7 mpc and @xmath0500 km s@xmath2 .",
    "however , in hi channel maps mcintyre ( 2002 ) sees a structure that resembles a tiny tidal arm .",
    "it terminates at the northeast hi complex , where there is an unusually large range in velocity ( swaters 1999 ) , and extends 3  to the southeast .",
    "although no other evidence of companions is seen , it is possible that ngc 1156 is not the pristine galaxy that it once seemed .",
    "ngc 4449 is one of the most luminous and actively star - forming ibm galaxies ( rc3 , hunter 1997 ) .",
    "it has an integrated m@xmath12 of @xmath1318.2 , making it 1.4 times as luminous as the lmc .",
    "it is forming stars twice as rapidly as the lmc even though the sizes of these two galaxies are similar .",
    "ngc 4449 is also unusual in having neutral hydrogen gas at 10@xmath15 atoms cm@xmath7 extending to six times its holmberg radius ( van woerden , bosma , & mebold 1975 ; bajaja , huchtmeier , & klein 1994 ) , a distribution that is about three times more extended than that of most other irregular galaxies ( huchtmeier , seiradakis , & materne 1981 ) .",
    "van woerden et al .  ( 1975 ) and bajaja et al .  (",
    "1994 ) found opposite velocity gradients between gas in the inner few arcminutes and the gas beyond that .",
    "hunter et al .",
    "( 1998 ) resolved part of the extended gas into enormous streamers that wrap around the galaxy .",
    "these , and the counter - rotating gas systems , suggest that ngc 4449 has undergone an interaction and possibly a merger with another galaxy ( hunter et al .",
    "ngc 4449 is a member of the cvni `` loose '' cloud of galaxies ( de vaucouleurs 1975 ) , and the small irregular ddo 125 is only 41 kpc away in the plane of the sky .",
    "models by theis & kohle ( 2001 ) suggest that ddo 125 was the interaction partner that produced the streamers of gas that we now see around ngc 4449 , but their models do not address the counter - rotating gas system in the central part of the galaxy .",
    "ngc 2366 , located in the m81 group of galaxies , is a lower luminosity irregular , having almost the same absolute b magnitude as the small magellanic cloud .",
    "it contains the supergiant h@xmath14ii  complex ngc 2363 to the southwest of the galaxy center .",
    "ngc 2363 is nearly twice as bright in h@xmath11  as the 30 doradus nebula in the large magellanic cloud and contains a large fraction of the total current star - formation activity of the galaxy ( aparicio et al .",
    "1995 , drissen et al .",
    "however , there is also another large h@xmath14ii  complex to the west of ngc 2363 and numerous smaller h@xmath14ii  regions scattered along the disk .",
    "we obtained long - slit spectra of our three galaxies during a 4-night observing run in 2000 january at the kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) 4 m telescope .",
    "we used the rc - spectrograph and a tektronics 2048@xmath17 ccd detector .",
    "the detector gain was 3.1 e@xmath18 adu@xmath2 , and the readnoise was 4.0 e@xmath19 .",
    "we used a 3-wide slit without a decker in order to obtain the longest slit possible .",
    "the useful portion of the slit was 463 pixels ( 5.5 ) in length , and from a series of star observations we determined the scale to be 0.71pixel@xmath2 .",
    "the stellar fwhm ( along the slit ) was @xmath202.5  near the center of the spectra .",
    "the focus degraded both blueward and redward of that so that at 4840   the fwhm of a star was 6  and the profile became double - peaked with a central minimum ; at 5274   the fwhm was 3.1 .    with grating bl380 in second order and order - separating filter bg39 we covered 48005350 at a dispersion of 0.36   pixel@xmath2 .",
    "the spectral resolution was 2.02.5 pixels , measured from comparison lamp emission lines and night sky lines .",
    "a typical value of 2.2 pixels corresponds to 47 km s@xmath2  at [ oiii]@xmath215007 .",
    "we chose this particular wavelength region in order to include the mgib absorption features at 5183.6  , 5172.7  , and 5167.3  .",
    "these features are stronger in the cooler stars ( late f through m ) .",
    "however , the cross - correlation technique includes all absorption lines detected in the spectra , not just the mgib features .",
    "in addition to the absorption lines , our spectra included emission lines , the strongest of which are h@xmath22  and [ oiii]@xmath214959 , 5007 .",
    "these emission lines allow us to obtain the radial velocities of the ionized gas for comparison to that of the stars .",
    "we used an fear comparison lamp for wavelength calibration , and took a calibration observation before and after each object spectrum .",
    "the electronic pedestal was subtracted using the overscan strip of each image and separate bias frames to remove two - dimensional structure .",
    "pixel - to - pixel variations were removed using observations of a white screen hanging on the inside of the dome .",
    "we also obtained twilight sky flats to determine the slit illumination function , but this was not an important correction for our purposes and it was applied only to the version of the spectra with linear wavelength repixelization .",
    "we observed a star stepped along the slit in order to remove s - distortion , but found that the amount of distortion was small compared to errors in fitting the centers of the stellar spectra and so did not apply this correction . during the run we observed radial velocity standard stars from the united states nautical almanac office ( 2000 ) and other late - type stars chosen from jacoby , hunter , & christian ( 1984 ) to use as templates in the cross - correlation .",
    "the template stars that we used are listed in table [ tabstars ] .",
    "we also used the twilight sky as the template of a g2v star .",
    "there was thin cirrus during a few observations , especially on the first night , but skies were clear otherwise .",
    "we observed ngc 1156 and ngc 4449 at a different position angle ( pa ) each of the four nights of the observing run .",
    "we oriented the slit along the optical major axis determined from a deep v - band image , along the minor axis , and at plus and minus 45  from the major axis . _ note that we define the position along the slit measured from the center of the galaxy in the direction of the given position angle as positive , and positions along the slit in the opposite direction as negative .",
    "_ each slit was placed on the galaxy using a center predetermined from the v - band images , as given in table [ tabgal ] .",
    "we offset to these positions from nearby stars .",
    "one exception was ngc 1156 s spectrum at pa 174  which was offset 2  east of the original position in order to avoid a bright star cluster . at each",
    "pa we observed a series of 2700 s exposures : 56 each of ngc 1156 and 4 each of ngc 4449 .",
    "the object spectra were preceded , interleaved , and followed with comparison lamp observations . because ngc 4449 is so large ,",
    "observations of it were also preceded , interleaved , and followed with separate sky observations taken 1  ( nights 1 and 2 ) or 6  ( nights 3 and 4 ) alternately north and south of the galaxy .    because ngc 2366 is much lower in surface brightness than ngc 1156 and ngc 4449 , we did not expect to detect absorption features well enough to measure stellar kinematics in this galaxy in the available time .",
    "therefore , we only observed this galaxy for the emission - line kinematics .",
    "we obtained observations at 4 different pa : three were placed on the center of the galaxy determined from our v - band image ; the fourth at pa 27was centered at 7@xmath23 29@xmath24 02.5@xmath25 , 69  1417  ( 2000 ) in order to reach the nebulae in the outer part of the galaxy .",
    "exposures at pas 30  and 120were 3600 s each ; spectra at pas 63  and 27  were single 1800 s exposures .",
    "a separate sky observation was obtained only for one of the observations at pa 30 .",
    "after the spectra were corrected for the electronic pedestal and pixel - to - pixel variations , we did a two - dimensional fit to each of the comparison lamp spectra .",
    "we then performed a two - dimensional transformation of each object frame using the nearest comparison .",
    "if an object frame was bracketed by comparisons , we did the two - dimensional fit to both comparisons simultaneously , effectively averaging any wavelength shifts . on one of the nights ,",
    "moving a mirror into place for observations of the comparison lamp generated an electronic signal that moved the grating by two encoder units ( 6 pixels ) .",
    "the motion was discrete in time , and therefore , the observations of the comparison lamp were readily used to remove this shift .",
    "our transformation repixelizes in the dispersion direction in order to impose a uniform wavelength scale , and it corrects for curvature along lines of constant wavelength .",
    "we did the transformations both to a linear wavelength scale and to a logarithmic scale ; the linear versions were used to measure the emission - line radial velocities and the logarithmic versions were used to measure the absorption velocities using cross - correlation techniques .",
    "we checked that the final galaxy spectra were aligned in wavelength by overplotting night sky lines .",
    "when multiple spectra were obtained for a given pa , we combined them with a rejection algorithm to remove cosmic rays . for ngc 2366 where we had single exposures , we edited cosmic rays by hand . for ngc 1156 , the background was removed using the region of the slit beyond the galaxy .",
    "the background from ngc 2366 spectra were removed in this way as well for all but one of the two observations at pa 30  for which a separate sky observation was available . for ngc 4449 ,",
    "separate sky frames were combined and subtracted from object frames . for the stars",
    ", we fit the background on either side of the star profile .",
    "to determine the radial velocity of the stars from absorption lines , we used a cross - correlation technique that matches absorption lines of template stars with the object spectrum ( simkin 1974 ; tonry & davis 1979 ; statler 1994 ) .",
    "we began by extracting the one - dimensional template star spectra from the two - dimensional spectra by summing along the slit to where the starlight blended into the background .",
    "for the object spectra , we wanted to increase the signal - to - noise as much as possible but without spatially summing over regions corresponding to large changes in radial velocity . therefore , we extracted one - dimensional object spectra by summing every 5 , 15 , and 25 rows ( 3.55 , 10.65 , 17.75 ) and comparing the results for the different summing intervals .",
    "we finally adopted the results for the 15-row sums , and those measurements are what are presented here .",
    "spectral regions with emission lines were excluded in the cross - correlation .    each object spectrum was compared with each f  k - type template star , giving an estimate of the heliocentric radial velocity for each fit .",
    "we averaged these velocities , weighted by the formal uncertainties of the fit to the cross - correlation peak .",
    "the uncertainties of each cross - correlation are of order 520 km s@xmath2 , depending on the signal - to - noise .",
    "there were no systematics greater than 0.3 km s@xmath2  involving any particular template star .",
    "on the one night that we did two radial velocity standards , cross - correlation of one with the other reproduces the v@xmath26  to 2.5 km s@xmath2 , and this is probably a good measure of the uncertainties for high signal - to - noise spectra and a lower limit on the uncertainty of the galaxy measurements .",
    "dah and ras independently applied the cross - correlation technique to the galaxy data , using different approaches to subtracting the continuum and fitting the cross - correlation peaks . comparing our results gave us a good feeling for the real uncertainties in our results .",
    "for all but a few points the agreement was within a few km s@xmath2 , well within the formal uncertainties .",
    "however , in ngc 1156 the point at r@xmath2742 in pa 129  differed by 24 km s@xmath2 , the point at r@xmath2752  in pa 84  differed by 18 km s@xmath2 , and the point at r@xmath28  and @xmath29  in pa 174differed by 11 km s@xmath2 .",
    "these differences are , nevertheless , within 12@xmath30 . in addition to the two cross - correlation approaches , vcr used the technique described below for measuring emission lines to measure the centroid of the mgib absorption lines in the central parts of two of the ngc 1156 spectra .",
    "this is a completely different approach from cross - correlation and involves inverting the spectrum to make the absorption lines look like emission lines .",
    "those measurements agreed well with the results of the cross - correlation technique , although it could only be applied to the brighter regions of the spectra .",
    "all of these experiments gave us confidence in our absorption line velocity measurements and their uncertainties .",
    "we used the radial velocity standards as template stars and cross - correlated the absorption lines to determine the radial velocities of the other template stars . to further fine tune the zero points",
    ", we determined the central velocity v@xmath31 of the galaxy in each spectrum where that was reliable to do and took the average .",
    "the radial velocities from each spectrum were then adjusted to match this v@xmath31 . the measured and average v@xmath31 and amount @xmath32v@xmath31 by which the velocities measured from each spectrum were adjusted",
    "are given in table [ tabvc ] .",
    "the emission spectra were measured by vcr using a customized measuring program in the software package vista ( rubin , hunter , & ford 1991 ) .",
    "the program fits a 2-dimensional polynomial to lines across a spectrum , and then returns the wavelength and radial position for each pixel ; no repixelling is done .    for the current observations ,",
    "several very minor modifications were made .",
    "first , the comparison fear frames for each pa were summed , using a weighting of 1 for a comparison taken between exposures , and a weight of 0.5 for a comparison taken at the beginning or end of each set .",
    "this assured that the individual comparison frames were handled in the same manner as the galaxy frames .",
    "the ( rectified , summed ) comparison was then fit with a low order polynomial whose coefficients were transfered to the corresponding galaxy frame . for each of the 12 summed comparison frames , the fit to 21 lines ( 4806 5328  ) , each sampled at 16 radial positions , had an rms of 0.04  , equivalent to 2.4 km s@xmath2 .",
    "we are satisfied that we have preserved the velocity and radial scales from the comparison arcs to this level . even though preliminary tests had shown that velocities differed only by a few km",
    "s@xmath2  in measuring the summed galaxy spectrum with any one of the bracketing comparisons , we preferred to sum the comparison frames so as to treat them in a manner analogous to that used for the galaxy spectra .",
    "only the measurements of the [ oiii]@xmath215007 line are used in the analysis that follows .",
    "h@xmath22 emission is superposed on a broad absorption line , and [ oiii]@xmath214959 is only one - third as strong as @xmath215007 , causing their measures to have lower weight .",
    "in addition , the focus of the spectra degrades below about 4950  , causing the emission lines to develop a faint red wing .",
    "we have confirmed that this does not affect the @xmath215007 emission line , and that there is no correlation between line intensity and velocity .",
    "we did measure both @xmath214959 and @xmath215007 for a few spectra and found that they were the same to within a few km s@xmath2 .",
    "we adopt an intrinsic wavelength of 5006.853    for [ oiii ] ( kaufman & sugar 1986 ) .",
    "the measuring program fits a gaussian to the emission in a given line at successive points along the slit , and the intensity - weighted centroid of the measures is adopted as the velocity there .",
    "tests have shown that the centroid is a more stable measure than the peak . in regions where the emission is strong ,",
    "a measurement is taken at each pixel ( 0.71 ) in the radial direction . where the emission is weak , measurements are integrated over 5 or 6 pixels ( 3.54.3 ) . the accuracy of each radial velocity is about @xmath05 km s@xmath2  on the plane of the sky .",
    "fitting of the cross - correlations peaks also yields a fwhm of the profile , which is a measure of the velocity dispersion .",
    "the resolution of the cross - correlation fitting is of order 70 km s@xmath2(square - root of 2 times the spectral resolution ) . for ngc 1156 the fwhm of the cross - correlation profiles",
    "are not resolved . for ngc 4449 ,",
    "the profile may be marginally resolved , indicating a high stellar velocity dispersion , but the results depend strongly on the template star used .",
    "the velocity dispersion in the neutral gas is also unusually high in this galaxy : of order 20 km s@xmath2  within the optical galaxy rather than the usual 10 km s@xmath2  seen in most gas disks ( hunter et al.1999 ) .",
    "however , given the low resolution and the uncertainties resulting from the choice of template star , we do not feel confident in stating a stellar velocity dispersion from these data for either galaxy .",
    "the velocity dispersion has been measured in the sm galaxy ugc 4325 ( @xmath33ngc 2552 ) by swaters ( 1999 ) and found to be 19@xmath34 km s@xmath2 . a velocity dispersion",
    "this small is not measureable with our data .",
    "one spectrum was obtained with the slit placed at a pa of 30 , along the major axis as shown in figure [ figv ] .",
    "one can see that this pa fairly respresents the major axis of the galaxy at all surface brightness levels ( see hunter , elmegreen , & van woerden [ 2001 ] for more discussion ) .",
    "another spectrum was obtained with the slit placed along the morphological minor axis of 120 , and one at a pa of 63  was designed to pick up the supergiant hii region to the southwest .",
    "these three spectra were obtained with the slits placed at the center of the galaxy .",
    "the fourth spectrum at pa=27  is displaced 113  from the center along pa=27  in order to intersect the prominent nebulosity to the north .",
    "the four slit positions are shown superposed on an h@xmath11  image of the galaxy in figure [ figv ] .",
    "strong ionized - gas emission lines of h@xmath22 and [ oiii]@xmath215007 and @xmath214959 are observed in all pas .",
    "weak lines of fe i ( 4986  , 5015  ) are detected from the large southwestern emission region ngc 2363 and from the northeastmost knot in pa=63 . in every case , these weaker lines arise in the regions with the strongest emission at h@xmath22 and [ oiii]@xmath214959,5007 . in pa=30  only , an emission line is seen at 5096 arising in a region of relatively strong continuum but only moderate line emission and extending into a region of low continuum .",
    "this line emission comes from the region northeast of the circular ring , about 5067  from the adopted center .",
    "in other knots with even stronger continua , this emission line is not observed .",
    "we plot v@xmath26  measured in the plane of the sky from each emission spectrum in figure [ fighelion2366 ] .",
    "linear rotation is observed generally northeast of the center in pa 27 , 30 , and 63  to 1.9 kpc . in pa=120 , the morphological minor axis ,",
    "velocities are essentially flat , with peak - to - peak velocity variations only of order @xmath010 km s@xmath2 .",
    "this would imply a kinematical minor axis of pa=120 , and major axis of about 30 .    the ionized gas in ngc 2366 exhibits deviations from overall rotation due to the energetic output of massive stars in star - forming regions .",
    "there are two supergiant h@xmath14ii  regions in the southwest part of the galaxy ",
    "ngc 2363 and ngc 2366-iii  that are known to exhibit high kinetic energies in the ionized gas ( hunter 1982 ; roy et al .  1992 ; hunter & gallagher 1997 ; martin 1997 ) .",
    "we see this at negative ra at pas of 30  and 63 in figure [ fighelion2366 ] .",
    "the ionized gas and hi have similar rotation velocities in the inner part of the galaxy .",
    "this can be seen in figure [ fighin2366em ] where the velocities of the ionized gas are superposed on position - velocity diagrams made from slices through the hi data ( hunter et al .",
    "we see that the ionized gas velocities nearly follow the ridge - line of the neutral gas with mostly modest deviations of the ionized gas from hi peaks .",
    "tomita et al .",
    "( 1998 ) found differences between the velocities of h@xmath11  and hi in ngc 2366 of order @xmath010 km s@xmath2 , consistent with what we see .",
    "major axis pas have been measured from optical surface photometry and from the hi velocity field as well . from r - band surface photometry , swaters ( 1999 ) determined a pa of 28  for the major axis of ngc 2366 .",
    "hunter et al .",
    "( 2001 ) used a v - band image and found a pa of 32 ; the exponential fit deduced from the v - band surface photometry to 7.5  radius also fit well the j - band surface photometry as far as it was measured ( 4  radius ) .",
    "these agree well with the nominal pa of 30  for the emission - line kinematics seen here .",
    "modeling of the hi velocity field , on the other hand , produces different parameters .",
    "the 21 cm observations do indicate an overall rotation , but with a notable asymmetry at large radii ( @xmath352 ) .",
    "modeling of 21 cm kinematic data over the galaxy as a whole gives a major axis of 3946(braun 1995 ; wevers , van der kruit , & allen 1986 ; swaters 1999 ; hunter et al .",
    "the inclination angles infered from the hi velocity field modeling are also different from those determined from the optical surface photometry , being smaller by 714 .",
    "these differences suggest that the hi distribution or kinematics deviate from axisymmetry ; that is , there are noncircular motions in the hi or the hi disk is warped .",

    "ngc 1156 has a rectangular appearance over much of the optical system .",

    "1990 ) . in modeling a disk galaxy",
    ", one usually assumes a plane circular thin disk which is inclined to the line of sight at a fixed angle . in a barred galaxy",
    "in which the bar extends most of the radius , the isophotes are not circular in the principle plane , the disk is not thin , and the orbits may precess , so the expectation in a well - behaved galaxy that the line of nodes and morphological axis are the same no longer applies . identifying bar structures in irregular galaxies",
    "is complicated by the lack of symmetry provided by spiral arms coming out of the nucleus or bar ( see discussion by roye & hunter [ 2000 ] and hunter et al .  [ 2001 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the bar in ngc 1156 is a much larger fraction of the optical galaxy than is the case in spirals , even to the point where the bar is most of the optical galaxy . in spirals , on the other hand ,",
    "the bar length is typically @xmath50.3 of the size of the stellar disk ( elmegreen & elmegreen 1985 ) .",
    "however , bar structures are very stable and they can grow on timescales less than a hubble time .",
    "so , while such large bars are not seen in more luminous galaxies , it is reasonable that a rectangular galaxy like ngc 1156 is dominated by a bar .",
    "the apparent low velocity gradient in the stars compared to that of the ionized gas in ngc 1156 is also striking .",
    "the gradient in the stars is about 3 times lower than that of the ionized gas .",
    "however , the uncertainties in the stellar rotation velocities are large enough that we can not rule out the possibility that the stellar gradient is nearly the same as that of the ionized gas . in figure",

    "large streamers of hi that encircle the galaxy indicate that another galaxy has interacted with ngc 4449 sometime in the past ( hunter et al .",
    "furthermore , the hi gas in the inner 2  of the galaxy appears to be counter - rotating with respect to the gas at larger radii , a clear signature of an interaction .",
    "the stars do not correspond to either gas system : _ we detected no ordered rotation _ to @xmath66 km",
    "s@xmath2  kpc@xmath2 to 1.2 kpc . as for ngc 1156 , the uncertainties in the stellar rotation velocities",
    "are relatively high , but the maximum allowed velocity gradient is still 4 times lower than the gradient observed in the ionized gas .",
    "as figure [ fighelion4449abs ] shows , it is unlikely that the stars are rotating at the same rate as the gas .",
    "what does it mean then when the stars do not rotate but the gas does ?",
    "one possibility is that the stars , in contrast to the gas , lie in a disk that is nearly face - on .",
    "an inclination of 45  is inferred from @xmath3 in the outer isophotes of the galaxy under the assumption that the intrinsic axis ratio is 0.3 .",
    "however , ngc 4449 , like ngc 1156 , is rectangular in shape , and there is a twisting of the v - band isophotes from the central rectangle to the outer galaxy .",
    "hunter et al .",
    "( 1999 ) interpret these characteristics as a bar structure that has a length that is 90% of d@xmath6 .",
    "if the galaxy is dominated by a bar , the observed @xmath3 is not a valid indicator of the inclination of the galaxy .",
    "if the stars are in a disk seen nearly face - on , how would we understand the kinematics of the gas ?",
    "one explanation is that the hi disk is highly warped ( swaters 1999 ) .",
    "we explored this possibility by constructing a model for the gas in which the gas is in orbits of constant inclination , but with precession - induced twisting of the line of nodes .",
    "we used fits to the hi velocity field of ngc 4449 to guide the models .",
    "hunter et al.(1998 , 1999 ) have presented such fits , but , because of the complex hi velocity field in this galaxy , we have now calculated additional fits to remind ourselves of the degree of uncertainty .",
    "we fit the data from 15  to 2  in summed annular steps of 15  and from 135  to 12  in steps of 45 . although we explored a variety of parameters , in the final fit we fixed the center as the optical center of the galaxy .",
    "first , we allowed the inclination , pa , and rotation speed to vary with each annulus",
    ". then we fixed the inclination and allowed only the pa and rotation speed to vary .",
    "we found an inclination of 71@xmath09  and a pa that varied between 80  and 105 .",
    "these values are close to those of hunter et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for the inner galaxy  an inclination of 77  at a position angle of 72 .",
    "thus , the present model uses a line of nodes of 80  in the central 2 . for the outer galaxy",
    ", we found an inclination of 66@xmath017with the position angle settling down to 253@xmath04  beyond 6 .",
    "hunter et al .",
    "( 1998 ) had found an inclination of 60and a position angle of 230@xmath017 .",
    "the models of theis & kohle ( 2001 ) that successfully reproduce the extended gas streamers constrain the outer gas disk to an inclination of 5070 .",
    "our model uses a line of nodes of @xmath67  ( @xmath68 ) in the outer regions ( r@xmath355 ) .",
    "the model that we present here extends to a radius of 10 , has a disk inclination of 68 , and uses a systemic velocity of 214 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the maximum circular velocity is 80 km s@xmath2 , and the velocity ramps linearly from 0 to 80 km s@xmath2  between r@xmath330 and r@xmath332.5 .",
    "the line of nodes in the inner 2  is 80  and decreases linearly with radius to @xmath13110  at a radius of 5 .",
    "a three dimensional representation of the model orbits is shown in figure [ figmod ] .",
    "physically , this model corresponds to a disk of gas in tilted orbits which precess around the minor axis of an oblate gravitational potential .",
    "precession periods are shorter at smaller radii , so the line of nodes regresses , and the gas disk twists .",
    "the line of nodes precesses retrograde to rotation in an oblate potential , and since precession periods are shorter at smaller radii , the line of nodes develops a leading twist with radius .",
    "such orbits can be stable until cloud - cloud collisions produce dissipation , so they can last a long time .",
    "we compare the model to the observations in figure [ figmodonhi ] . here",
    "we reproduce the hi position - velocity plots from figure [ fighin4449em ] and superpose simulated observations of the model at 15  intervals at our four pas .",
    "one can see that the model reproduces well the observed hi rotation velocities including the counter - rotation in the inner galaxy .",
    "it predicts broad or multiple profiles in the hi in places : particularly at @xmath022.5  along pa 46  and @xmath01.52  along pa 91 .",
    "plots of hi profiles in the inner galaxy do show regions with broad and double - peaked profiles ( broad profiles are easily seen in the position - velocity plots of figure [ figmodonhi ] ) , although not exclusively at the regions predicted by the models , which do not take account of beam - smearing in the hi observations .",
    "we conclude that this simple model is a plausible representation of the orbits of the gas in ngc 4449 .",
    "such tilted orbits would result from tipping gas in at an angle to the stellar disk .",
    "most probably the gas was acquired from a passing or merging object .",
    "since there are other signs that ngc 4449 was involved in a past interaction , we can understand the gas in these peculiar orbits as resulting from that interaction or a second event .",
    "the models of theis & kohle ( 2001 ) that reproduce the extended streamers as resulting from an interaction with ddo 125 involve no mass transfer and do not reproduce the apparent counter - rotating gas system in the center .",
    "if the acquired gas was simply gas in ngc 4449 pulled out by a passing galaxy and now settling back in , we would expect stars to have been pulled out into tilted orbits also , which we do not see .",
    "thus , an accretion event is required .",
    "hunter et al .",
    "( 1999 ) had argued that ngc 4449 before the interaction had to have been a late - type galaxy and , therefore , likely gas - rich .",
    "this argument was based on the ensemble of characteristics including small m@xmath12 , small optical scale length , lack of a bulge , small rotation speed , current high gas content , and low metallicity .",
    "if ngc 4449 was relatively gas - rich to begin with , the acquired gas is falling onto other gas that was already there , presumably in the same orbits as the stars .",
    "the original disk gas could have lost angular momentum in the encounter and been pushed further in , and is now a small inner nearly - face - on disk .",
    "however , the hi observations do not allow such a face - on disk of original material to be very massive ; the entire hi mass within r@xmath372  is only @xmath69 m_@xmath70(hunter et al .",
    "1999 ) , and the center of the galaxy represents a minimum in the hi distribution .    in the models , the twisting of the line of nodes of the gas takes place from a radius of 2  to a radius of 5 .",
    "the region 2@xmath37r@xmath373  is a special place in ngc 4449 in several other ways as well .",
    "first , the morphological major axis changes pa in this region .",
    "the pa of the morphological major axis rotates from 46  for the rectangular inner galaxy ( r@xmath372.2 ) to 64  at r@xmath353.1 .",
    "if the rectangular structure of the galaxy is a bar , this region represents the end of the bar potential .",
    "second , there are large hi complexes located at a radius of 1.52 . these hi complexes are part of a large hi ring that surrounds the optical galaxy .",
    "gas could be collecting there both because it is trapped near the end of the bar , and because infalling gas is piling on with an increased number of cloud - cloud collisions .",
    "the cloud - cloud collisions would further account for the star formation that is currently seen there .",
    "sung et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have argued that irregular galaxies are triaxial in shape . in ngc 4449 ,",
    "the twisting of the isophotes ( de zeeuw 1984 ) and the rectangular shape ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) could be consistent with a triaxial shape with stars on box and loop orbits .",
    "however , few elliptical galaxies , which as a class include triaxial systems , are as boxy as ngc 4449 ( see peleier et al .  199 ; figure 2 of ryden et al .",
    "1999 ; figure 6.1 of sparke & gallagher 2000 ; but also see figure 2 of jarvis 1987 ) , although bar structures can be ( athanassoula et al .",
    "1990 ) . since we can fit the observations of ngc 4449 with a reasonable model involving gas in a warped plane relative to the stars , and have an obvious mechanism for putting gas into these orbits , we do not embrace more complicated explanations .",
    "we measure a weak velocity gradient in the stellar disk of ngc 1156 and no rotation of the stars in ngc 4449 .",
    "we find that we can understand the stellar and gas kinematics of ngc 1156 and ngc 4449 as disk systems dominated by bar potentials . in both galaxies",
    "the bar contains a large fraction of the light of the optical galaxy .",
    "the low stellar velocity gradient of the stars in ngc 1156 is consistent with the velocity gradient of the gas within the observational uncertainties . a consistent and satisfying picture of ngc 1156 results",
    "if the stellar velocity gradient is close to that of the ionized gas and all components are in circular rotation about a common axis .",
    "the misalignment of the kinematical axis with the morphological axis is the result of a large bar dominating the disk luminosity . in ngc 4449 , where the stars rotate much more slowly than the gas",
    ", we can qualitatively explain the observations by assuming that the stars are in a disk seen nearly face - on , while the gas lies in a tilted disk with precession - induced twisting of the line of nodes .",
    "most likely , the gas in this tilted disk was acquired from an interaction or possibly a merger , consistent with other signs of a past interaction in the galaxy .",
    "we wish to thank phil massey , skip andree , and other members of the kpno staff for help in making the 4 m telescope and rc spectrograph perform so well for us .",
