    "quantum mechanics on graphs is recently attracting more and more attention due to its current and prospective use in nanosciences , especially nanoelectronics @xcite .",
    "in particular , since quantum graphs serve as effective models of graph - like structures of submicron sizes , they allow to study single electron devices based on interconnected nanoscale wires .",
    "one of the first such applications emerged in the spectral filtering .",
    "it is known that a line carrying the @xmath0-interaction is usable as a high - pass filter , and similarly , a line carrying the @xmath1-interaction works as a low - pass filter .",
    "more complex spectral filters have been developed as well , for instance a trident filter  @xcite , or a y - shaped branching filter , functionning as a high - pass / low - pass junction @xcite .    if a quantum device is easily controllable , its usefulness is markedly enhanced . in principle ,",
    "any device based on a quantum graph , including the aforementionned filters , can be controlled by adjusting its internal properties , for example , by varying the parameters of the couplings in its vertices .",
    "however , such a controllability is hard to be implemented in practice since it requires a real - time modification of a nanoscale object .",
    "it is , therefore , highly desirable to develop a device , controllable in a simpler manner .    in this paper",
    "we propose a quantum filtering device that can be controlled without affecting its internal structure .",
    "we consider a model in which constant potentials are applied to the lines of a star graph , and the control is achieved through the variation of the potential strengths .",
    "the design of the device essentially relies on a special type of point interaction used in the star graph vertex , namely , on a scale invariant ( flp  tsutsui ) coupling .",
    "it should be emphasized that the flp ",
    "tsutsui point interaction is very different from usual free coupling and the @xmath0  potential .",
    "its exotic scattering properties together with the external potentials on the lines induce a threshold resonance effect , on which the filtering function is based .",
    "it is known that quantum graph vertices with flp ",
    "tsutsui couplings can be approximately constructed from vertices carrying @xmath0-couplings @xcite . in this paper",
    "we improve the existing approximation schemes , and , in addition , demonstrate its convergence in terms of the scattering matrices . since the vertices carrying the @xmath0-couplings can be approximated by regular , smooth potentials  @xcite , the realization of the required flp ",
    "tsutsui couplings is within reach of the technology in the near future .",
    "therefore , our quantum graph model of a quantum device is of a practical relevance , not just a mathematical abstraction .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ section : preliminaries ] we prepare the necessary theoretical basis , including the scattering formalism of quantum graphs with external potentials on the lines . in section  [ section : device ]",
    "we introduce the concept of a potential - controllable quantum filter .",
    "the first device of this type is designed in section  [ section : n=3 ] , namely a band - pass spectral filter with one passband tunable by adjusting the potential on the controlling line . before generalizing the result to more complex devices ,",
    "we devote section  [ section : potential ] to a practical question .",
    "although the control potential is assumed to be constant on the whole line , we demonstrate that its small perturbation in a segment close to the vertex , which can be expected in practice , does not distort the filtering function .",
    "the idea of section  [ section : n=3 ] is extended to filters with two controlling lines in sections  [ section : n=4 ] and  [ section : band - pass ] .",
    "the filter proposed in section  [ section : n=4 ] has two passbands , and the position of each of them is independently tunable by a control potential .",
    "the filter developed in section  [ section : band - pass ] has one passband of adjustable bandwidth : its upper and lower cutoff energies are both tunable by the potentials on the controlling lines . in section  [ section : n=2r ]",
    "we introduce a spectral filter with @xmath2 controlling lines , @xmath3 .",
    "the filter has @xmath2 passbands , each of which can be independently adjusted ( as well as disabled ) by the potentials on the controlling lines .",
    "this result is achieved by generalizing the idea of section  [ section : n=4 ] .",
    "finally , a filter with multiple independent outputs is studied in section  [ section : branching ] .",
    "the outputs work as individually tunable band - pass filters ; the position of the passband at each output is adjustable by tuning a potential on a dedicated controlling line .",
    "the construction of the flp  tsutsui couplings is discussed in sections  [ section : approximation ] and  [ section : s - matrix ] . in section  [ section : approximation ] we demonstrate how they can be approximately represented by a small web carrying @xmath0-couplings in the vertices and vector potentials on the lines . in section  [ section : s - matrix ] we calculate the on - shell scattering matrix of the approximating graph and prove its convergence to the scattering matrix of the required flp ",
    "tsutsui vertex in the small size limit .",
    "the paper is concluded by section  [ section : conclusion ] in which we discuss possible extensions and related open problems .",
    "a wave function of a particle confined to a graph having @xmath4 lines @xmath5 of the lengths @xmath6 has @xmath4 components , @xmath7 , and the corresponding hilbert space @xmath8 is given by @xmath9 . let us assume that there are potentials @xmath10 and vector potentials @xmath11 imposed on the graph lines .",

    "the most general form of the boundary conditions is @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are complex @xmath26 matrices .    to ensure the self - adjointness of the hamiltonian , which is in physical terms equivalent to conservation of the probability current at the vertex , the matrices @xmath24 and",

    "the requirements   can be partly included into the boundary conditions   by writing the matrices @xmath30 in a special form .",

    "we call _ @xmath39-form _ of boundary conditions",
    ". it is simple and unique , but on the other hand it requires an appropriately chosen line numbering , see  @xcite for details .    in this paper",
    "we primarily use the @xmath39-form   that best meets our needs .",
    "however , any form of boundary conditions has its pros and cons and is suitable for certain applications .",
    "the @xmath0-coupling ( or `` @xmath0  potential '' ) in a vertex of a quantum graph is characterized by boundary conditions @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a parameter of the coupling .",
    "the @xmath0-coupling is the second most natural singular interaction ( after the free coupling ) by reason of its simple interpretation : it can be understood as a limit case of properly scaled smooth potentials  @xcite .",
