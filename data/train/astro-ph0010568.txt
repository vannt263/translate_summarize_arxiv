    "the silicate emission features at about 10 and 18@xmath2 m are characteristic for oxygen  rich dust envelopes .",
    "however , these features were also discovered in some optically classified carbon stars ( little - marenin@xcite ; willems & de jong@xcite ) , named later silicate carbon stars .",
    "furthermore , many silicate carbon stars are recognized as @xmath3c - rich ( j - type ) carbon stars ( lambert et al.@xcite ; lloyd evans@xcite and references therein ) . the most recent compilation of 22 known and suspected silicate carbon stars is presented by chen et al.(@xcite ) .",
    "note also the discovery of the first extragalactic silicate carbon star ( iras04496@xmath46958 ) in the large magellanic cloud ( trams et al.@xcite ) .",
    "the detection of silicate emission from some ( silicate ) carbon stars suggests that their relatively close surroundings contain oxygen  based dust , in spite of their photospheric chemical composition which shows c / o@xmath51 . an additional argument for the existence of oxygen  rich material in the vicinity of these stars comes from the detection of water and hydroxyl maser lines towards some of them ( see little - marenin et al.@xcite and engels@xcite and references therein ) . to date",
    "h@xmath6o masers were found in four ( j  type ) silicate carbon stars and only one of them ( v778cyg ) exibits oh maser emission in the main  lines . in addition 1612mhz",
    "maser emission was detected in fjf270 ( te lintel hekkert@xcite ) .",
    "here we report the results of a high sensitivity search for oh emission towards 14 j  type carbon stars including 7 known silicate carbon stars .",
    "the observations were performed with the nanay radio telescope on april 613 , 1999 .",
    "the hpbw was @xmath7 in right ascension by @xmath8 in declination .",
    "a dual channel receiver was used .",
    "the system temperature was about 50k .",
    "the ratio of flux density to antenna temperature was 1.1jyk@xmath9 at @xmath10 declination .",
    "the 1024channel autocorrelation spectrometer was split into 4 banks , each covering a bandwidth of 0.2mhz , for the three oh lines .",
    "the 1612mhz satellite line was observed in both circular polarizations while the 1665 and 1667mhz main  lines were observed in left and right circular polarization , respectively .",
    "the spectra were taken in frequency switching mode with channel spacings of 0.28 and 0.29kms@xmath9 at the main  lines and the satellite line , respectively .",
    "upper flux density limit for the non  detections was 80mjy ( 3@xmath11 ) .",
    "w12 was observed to provide the flux density calibration which was accurate to about 10% .",
    "our program stars are listed in table1 with the designation from the general catalogue of cool galactic carbon stars ( ccgcs , stephenson@xcite ) given in the first column .",
    "known silicate carbon stars are marked in boldface .",
    "previously detected h@xmath6o and/or oh maser lines are marked by a ` + ' sign while our new detections are depicted by a ` + + ' sign .",
    "oh masers were found in nsv2814 ( main  lines ) and in v778cyg ( satellite line ) .",
    "note that the 1612mhz maser line towards v778cyg has not been detected either by barnbaum et al.(@xcite ) nor by little - marenin et al.(@xcite ) .",
    "the spectra are shown in fig.1 where , for the sake of comparison , re  observed oh main  lines from v778cyg are presented . in v778cyg",
    "the 1667mhz feature at @xmath416.0kms@xmath9 has a peak flux density of 0.30jy , which is a factor of 1.5 higher than the 1665mhz peak of 0.19jy at @xmath416.9kms@xmath9 . within the measurement errors the intensities and radial velocities of these lines are the same as observed 12 years ago ( little  marenin et al.@xcite ) . the 1612mhz feature of 0.12jy peaks at @xmath414.4kms@xmath9 .",
    "this indicates that the 1612mhz emission is slightly redshifted relatively to the oh main  lines but coincides with a @xmath414kms@xmath9 component of the h@xmath6o maser ( engels & leinert@xcite ) .    in nsv2814",
    "the peak intensities of the 1665 and 1667mhz are 0.24 and 0.27jy , respectively .",
    "the velocities of oh features at @xmath423.5 and @xmath422.8kms@xmath9 are very different from the h@xmath6o maser velocity of @xmath413kms@xmath9 detected about 7 years ago ( engels@xcite ) .",
    "although temporal variations may affect the maser profiles , the difference in velocities of the oh and h@xmath6o maser features of about 10kms@xmath9 is quite high for an agb object .",
    "this may suggest that each maser is associated with a different object .",
    "little - marenin et al.(@xcite ) noted that ccgcs1158 may be incorrectly associated with the iras source .",
    "furthermore , the intensity ratio of 1667/1665mhz transitions of about 1.1 suggests optically thin lte conditions , so that the masers may arise in the intervening interstellar medium .",
    "the case of nsv2814 needs further careful studies .    in spite of almost 15 years of debate",
    ", the formation of silicate carbon stars still remains controversial .",
    "a stability of the silicate feature ( yamamura et al.@xcite ) and oh main  lines ( this work ) in v778 cyg makes the scenario of _ fast _ transition from m  type agb stars into carbon stars difficult to reconcile with the lifetime of silicate emission from an expanding detached shell ( see e.g. yamamura et al.@xcite ) . a plausible scenario may be some kind of long  lived reservoirs of oxygen  rich material in a binary system ( e.g. lloyd evans@xcite and jura & kahane@xcite ) with ( possibly ) a main sequence secondary ( e.g. lambert et al.@xcite and yamamura et al.@xcite ) .",
    "silicate carbon stars seem to be related to the _ normal _ j  type carbon stars in the sense that both groups show h@xmath6o maser emission ( engels@xcite ) and that the mechanism responsible for their low @xmath12c/@xmath3c ratios might be the same ( ohnaka & tsuji@xcite ) ."
