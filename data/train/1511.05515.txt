    "`` many such saviours have come and gone , yet the reliable silicon cmos continues to be scaled and to reach even higher performance levels '' _ @xcite . among these new materials , graphene is expected to have a great potential impact in our society , in general , and in electronics , in particular @xcite .",
    "graphene is a single 2d layer of carbon atoms with a hexagonal lattice @xcite .",
    "it has a linear energy - momentum dispersion ( which provides massless dirac fermions ) , an extraordinary elasticity ( allowing flexible electronics ) and extremely large electrical conductivity ( with electron velocities of @xmath0 ) @xcite .",
    "however , graphene has a zero bandgap implying a small on - off ratio for graphene digital fets .",
    "in addition , reliable techniques to create a sizeable gap degrade a lot the properties mentioned above . therefore , it seems that successful graphene logic applications are not currently feasible . on the contrary ,",
    "the large conductivity of graphene is very welcome for ( small - signal ) radio frequency applications ( such as amplifiers or mixers ) @xcite which are not required to switch off and can benefit from the high mobilities offered by graphene .",
    "although the best performance of nowaday radio - frequency graphene transistors is still quite below the one obtained from silicon and iii - v hemts @xcite , significant progress has been made since the experimental demonstration of the first gigahertz graphene transistors in 2008 @xcite .",
    "most notably , a research group reported graphene fets breaking the 100-ghz cut - off frequency ( @xmath1 ) mark in 2010 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , only a few months later , researchers demonstrated @xcite a graphene fet that has a @xmath1 of 300 ghz . on the theoretical side , a very simple estimation of the intrinsic cut - off frequency as the inverse of electron transit time shows that one can easily reach frequencies higher than 1 terahertz ( thz ) ( active region shorter than @xmath2 with electron velocity on the order of @xmath0 ) .",
    "_ are such simple intrinsic high - frequency predictions really achievable ?",
    "what noise is expected at such frequencies ?",
    "_ usually , predictions of the high - frequency behavior of graphene devices are studied through its simulations under quasi - static approximations , where the time derivative of the electric and magnetic fields is neglected .",
    "there are many successful examples in the literature on how quasi - static approaches are still capable of getting thz information of electron devices . among many others",
    ", we mentioned those based on time - independent solutions of the non - equilibrium green s function framework owing to the klimeck s group with the nemo simulator @xcite or to fiori and iannaccone s group with the nanotcad vides simulator @xcite . in this regard , the _ ab initio _",
    "( time - independent ground - state ) density functional theory ( dft ) has also been successfully used in the literatures for such graphene thz predictions @xcite .",
    "the strategy of all these steady - state simulators , for example , for predicting the cut - off frequency is , first , simulating the values of currents and charges from their powerful quantum steady - state simulators , then , calculating transconductances and capacitances from the currents and charges dependence on the ( gate ) voltage , respectively , and finally , plugging these last calculations of transconductances and capacitances into an analytical expression of the cut - off frequency ( usually obtained from a small - signal circuit model ) . in any case , the procedure of getting ac properties from time - independent ( steady - state ) simulations has been demonstrated to be very successful , providing very - valuable physical insight of the high frequency problems while greatly reducing the computational burden associated to explicit time - dependent simulations @xcite .",
    "for example , these quasi - static approaches have clearly demonstrated that one of the most relevant drawbacks today for getting the expected theoretical thz cut - off frequencies in graphene transistors is the ( extrinsic ) resistance between the metallic 3d contact and the 2d graphene channel @xcite .",
    "this paper is aimed to carefully study the intrinsic thz performance of graphene transistors beyond the quasi - static approximation , by explicitly simulating the time - dependent displacement and particle currents in the active region of graphene transistors . in our previous work",
    ", we have presented an original strategy to optimize radio frequency performance of gate - all around ( gaa ) quantum - wire silicon fets by modifying their lateral areas , without length scaling or mobility improvement @xcite .",
    "we have seen that , in the definition of the duration of the total current peak due to an electron travelling along the device , there are scenarios where the exact transit time of the electron is not at all a relevant parameter for @xmath1 estimations .",
    "we have proved @xcite that , for gaa quantum - wire silicon fets , the ultimate responsible of the high - frequency noise is not the electron transit time @xmath3 , but a different time related to the duration of the total current peak @xmath4 , while the electron is crossing the device . in this paper , we will show that similar arguments can be also applied to the intrinsic thz performance of graphene transistors . along this work",
    "we refer to intrinsic modeling in order to emphasize that spurious effects ( like the important drawbacks occasioned by the contact resistance mentioned above ) are not considered in this work .",
    "we only deal with electron dynamics inside the device active region .",
    "the intrinsic klein ( band - to - band ) tunneling and positive - negative energy injection on graphene transistors are carefully analyzed and we provide predictions on their effect on the graphene high - frequency performance . from the numerical simulations , we show that the unavoidable klein tunneling and positive - negative energy injection in graphene structures increase the thz noise one order of magnitude without similar increment on the current , degrading the signal - to - noise ratio , in comparison with the simulation without band - to - band tunneling and only positive energy injection .",
    "after this introduction , in section 2 and section 3 , we provide some preliminary discussions about our simulation tool beyond the quasi - static approximation , i.e. through the explicit simulation of time - dependent particle and displacement currents .",
    "we also discuss the relation between electron dynamics and high - frequency spectrum depending on the fact of dealing with 2-terminal ( resistor ) or 3-terminal ( transistor ) devices . in section 4 and section 5 ,",
    "the bitlles simulator @xcite is used to study the intrinsic high - frequency performance of graphene fets , in terms of semi - classical trajectories compatible with the energy - dispersion of the dirac equation , klein tunneling and positive - negative ( kinetic ) energy injection model .",
    "since most of the predictions of high - frequency performance of graphene transistors have been obtained from the quasi - static approximation with time - independent models , some preliminary discussions about the formalism and what kind of new results can be accessible with this time - dependent ( dynamic ) simulation of particle plus displacement currents are mandatory .",
    "the motivation for focusing our attention on the displacement current is the following .",
    "the particle current ( i.e. the flux of electrons on a particular surface ) is basically related to the injection rate of electrons from the contact and its order of magnitude is not modified when the input signal frequency of the device is increased . on the contrary ,",
    "the displacement current ( i.e. the time - derivative of the electric field on a particular surface ) is roughly proportional to the input signal frequency .",
    "therefore , at very low frequencies only the particle current is relevant , while the displacement current becomes negligible in front of the particle current .",
    "this is the typical working region of electronics . on the contrary , at frequencies high enough , the displacement current ( proportional to the frequency growth ) becomes the only relevant in front of the particle current .",
    "this is the working scenario for electromagnetic applications .",
    "certainly , in the frontier between typical electronics and electromagnetism there is a region where both displacement and particle currents become relevant .",
    "let us discuss first the role of the displacement current on the measured value of the current that we get in a laboratory .",
    "it is common to compute the electrical current on the ( simulated ) surface @xmath5 ( @xmath5=@xmath6 at the device contact ) of the active region in , while a real measurement is performed on the ( non - simulated ) surface @xmath7 in the ammeter . _ then , is the current on @xmath5 equal to that on the ammeter ?",
    "_ in fact , these currents will only be identical if we consider the total current @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are respectively the particle and displacement components . owing to the current conservation law , an integral of the total current density @xmath11 on a closed surface , for example , in the wire @xmath12 in is zero .",
    "we have defined @xmath13 as the surface parallel to the transport direction in the cable . in particular , for a cable we can assume @xmath14 , so finally we get @xmath15 .",
    "the important point is that we have to simulate the total current ( not only the particle current ) on @xmath5 if we want to ensure that the simulated result is equal to the measured one on @xmath7 .",
    "the standard expression of the displacement current , @xmath10 , evaluated on a surface @xmath16 of the active region @xmath17 in is proportional to the time - derivative of the electric field :    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the inhomogeneous electric permittivity , and @xmath20 is the electric field vector at the position @xmath21 at the time @xmath22 . the particle current expression , @xmath9 , computed on @xmath16 is    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the current density vector at the position @xmath21 at the time @xmath22 , the sum @xmath25 is the number of electrons that have crossed the surface @xmath16 during time step of the simualtion @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is the electron charge without sign .",

    ", we provide an alternative expression ( named ramo - shockley - pellegrini ( rsp ) theorem @xcite ) for computing the time - dependent total current different from direct definitions of displacement current ( equation ) and particle current ( equation ) .",
    "we consider the parallelepiped of volume @xmath30 limited by the closed surface @xmath31 which is composed of six rectangular surfaces @xmath32 as seen in the device active region of .",
    "the total time - dependent current in a surface @xmath16 is defined by the rsp theorem as @xmath33 , and with : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the @xmath36-th electron velocity , @xmath37 is the scalar potential at position @xmath21 and time @xmath22 .",

    "let us note that the terms @xmath41 and @xmath42 can not be interpreted as particle current and displacement current , respectively .",
    "in fact , the term @xmath41 includes itself the particle current and part of the displacement current altogether .",

    "the rsp theorem provides a very simple mathematical framework to answer this question .",
    "first , we focus on a 2-terminal device . the first version of the rsp theorem was presented by the work of shockley @xcite in 1938 and of ramo @xcite in 1939 .",
    "they , separately , provided a simple expression for the computation of the total ( particle plus displacement ) current flowing through a vacuum tube , i.e. the typical electron devices at that time .",
    "a vacuum tube can be roughly modeled as two infinite metallic plates separated by air .",
    "according to the ( a ) , we name @xmath46 the left plate and @xmath6 the right plate , assume that an electron is moving inside volume @xmath17 .",
    "it can be demonstrated that we get @xmath48 when considering the volume @xmath49 ( the bottom and upper surfaces are much smaller than the lateral ones ) which captures all the lines of the electric field generated in the active region by the moving electron @xcite , where @xmath50 is the distance between plates and @xmath51 is the unit vector in the transport direction perpendicular to the plates .",
    "then , using equations and for just one electron moving with velocity @xmath52 in the transport direction , the total current on @xmath46 during @xmath53 can be written as : @xmath54 being @xmath27 the ( unsigned ) electron charge .",
    "the current value is a constant while the electron is inside the @xmath17 and its time - integral during @xmath55 gives the expected transmitted charge @xmath56 .",

    "the relevant time for the peak current @xmath4 is roughly equal to the electron transit time @xmath55 .",
    "_ can we envision other scenarios where transient current collected on a particular surface is not related to the electron transit time ?",
    "_ below , we answer positively to this question .    to go beyond",

    "@xmath80 , shown in ( a ) , the lines start from the point charge and tend to reach the bottom / top regions .",
    "however , the difference on the values of the dielectrics in the three regions implies a tendency of the electric lines to keep in region @xmath81 .",
    "a moving electron inside the channel has a strong influence on surfaces @xmath6 or @xmath46 ( right and left in the figure ) and leads to a non - negligible displacement current there . on the contrary ,",
    "displacement current on surface @xmath82 and surface @xmath83 in volume @xmath17 , top and bottom in the ( a ) , can be somehow neglected .",
    "thus , in conclusion , although dealing with a 3-terminal device , the different dielectrics tend to provide an electric field similar to that found in a 2-terminal device .    on the contrary ,",
    "when @xmath84 , most lines of the electric field tend to reach surface @xmath82 and surface @xmath83 in volume @xmath17 , top and bottom in the ( b ) , providing a non - negligible current in the gates in a 3-terminal device .",
    "thus , the instantaneous current on @xmath46 do not need to be equal to that on @xmath6 , while still satisfying instantaneous current conservation .    from this simple results ,",
    "we conclude that a proper engineering design of the different electric permittivity allows to maximize / minimize the displacement current collected on the gates . in next subsection , we will show that this type of manipulation of the source , drain and gate currents can be also realized by modifying the lateral areas of the graphene fets .",

    "we conclude from that the shape of the current pulse ( transient current ) is strongly dependent on the lateral surface @xmath94 .",

    "interestingly , the temporal distance between the maximum and minimum values of the gate current increases for larger lateral areas .    before providing full numerical results with the bitlles simulator ,",

    "again we emphasize that the psd increases two orders of magnitude , while the dc current is roughly a factor of 10 greater than that in the first case .",
    "for the noise , the new thermal injections from below the fermi point implies larger noise . for the dc current ,",
    "now , there is a combination of a decrement of the dc current due to klein tunneling and an increment due to the source - to - drain injection from below of the fermi dirac point ( greater than the drain - to - source injection ) .",

    ". such increment of the noise is not compensated by a similar increment on the average dc current ( interpreted here as the signal ) , providing an unavoidable degradation of the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "certainly , the use of a semi - classical simulation tool is an approximation , however , we have already tested with ( bohmian ) quantum solutions of the dirac equation that the extension towards quantum simulations tools will not provide important variations @xcite . the main approximation in this present work ( common in most monte carlo simulations ) is the fact that the pauli principle ( the exchange interaction between electrons ) is not explicitly considered during the dynamics of electrons in the device active region .",
