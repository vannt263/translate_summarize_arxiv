    "in @xmath0 euler proved that for @xmath1 , the series and the product below are convergent and that @xmath2 showing a connection among the series over the positive integers in the left side and the product over the prime numbers in the right side . in @xmath3 riemann had the bright idea of extending the function to the set of complex numbers in an analytic way , and he called @xmath4 to this function , which is meromorphic having only a pole at @xmath5 .",
    "he achieved it by proving the functional equation @xmath6 the function @xmath4 has trivial zeros at @xmath7 for @xmath8 .",
    "the other zeros @xmath9 are therefore called the non - trivial zeros and are complex . the following convergent series for @xmath4 , valid for all @xmath10 , was proved by hasse in @xmath11 and rediscovered by jonathan sondow @xcite : @xmath12 in @xmath13 hadamard proved that @xmath14 riemann also knew this product and arrived at it using , in edwards words @xcite , an obscure argument . as the product shows that the zeros of zeta determine the whole function , riemann thought that there had to be a connection among the prime numbers and the zeros of zeta .",
    "he showed directly this relation by proving an explicit formula for the number of primes @xmath15 less or equal than @xmath16 in terms of the complex zeros of @xmath4 . a simpler variant of his formula is @xmath17 valid for @xmath16 not a prime power , where @xmath18 is the mangoldt function , which is defined by @xmath19 if @xmath20 is a power of @xmath21 , and @xmath22 otherwise .",
    "the asymptotic approximation @xmath23 is equivalent to the prime number theorem conjectured by gauss , namely @xmath24 from the functional equation of zeta , riemann proved that all the non - trivial zeros of zeta are in the band @xmath25 $ ] and in @xmath26 hadamard and de la valle poussin achieved to prove the prime number theorem by showing that @xmath4 has no zeros of the form @xmath27 . the riemann s famous conjecture stating that the real part of all the non - trivial zeros was",
    "equal to @xmath28 remains unproved .",
    "riemann introduced the notation @xmath29 for the zeros of zeta . in this way",
    "his conjecture is the statement that all the @xmath30 are real .",
    "in addition , riemann conjectured a convergent asymptotic behavior , as @xmath31 , for the number of complex zeros with positive imaginary part less or equal than @xmath32 : @xmath33 which was proved by von mangoldt , who improved this result , by showing in @xmath34 that @xmath35 around @xmath36 backlund derived an exact formula for counting the zeros @xcite : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the riemann - siegel theta function , which is defined by @xmath39 in @xmath40 e. landau proved the following formula for the mangoldt function @xcite , @xcite : @xmath41 which implies @xmath42 it has the surprising property that neglecting a finite number of zeros of zeta we still recover the mangoldt function .",
    "related to it is the self - replicating property of the zeros of zeta observed recently in the statistics of @xcite , and later proved in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we prove a formula which resembles in a certain way to that of landau : @xmath43 which implies @xmath44 we see that it shares with that given by landau the property of invariance when we neglect a finite number of zeros .",
