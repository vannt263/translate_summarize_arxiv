    "while the standard model(sm ) is in relatively good agreement with all precision electroweak data@xcite , it leaves too many unanswered questions that will somehow need to be addressed by new physics at or above the electroweak scale .",
    "supersymmetry(susy ) , in the guise of the minimal supersymmetric standard model(mssm ) , provides a potential starting point for the exploration of this new physics ; however , while the mssm provides a simplified framework in which to work , most authors would agree that the mssm is itself inadequate due to the very large number of free parameters it contains .",
    "furthermore , the mssm can not be the whole story of low - energy susy since , on its own , it does not explain how susy is broken or why the scale of this breaking is of order @xmath4 tev . in going beyond the mssm",
    "there are many possible paths to follow . in this paper",
    "we discuss two of the simplest of these scenarios : an extension of the sm gauge group by an additional @xmath5 factor broken near the tev scale and @xmath0-parity violation , both of which are well - motivated by string theory .",
    "although these two alternatives would appear to have little in common , we will see below that they can lead to similar phenomenology at present and future colliders and may be easily confused in certain regions of the parameter space for each class of model .",
    "unlike the case of grand unified theories(gut ) , where any additional @xmath5 s may break at any arbitrary scale below @xmath6 , perturbative string models with gravity mediated susy breaking are known to predict an assortment of new gauge bosons with masses of order 1 tev , as well as the existence of other exotic matter states with comparable masses@xcite .",
    "such models lead one to expect that the existence of a @xmath7 at mass scales which will be accessible at run ii of the tevatron or at future colliders is quite natural .",
    "similarly , the case for potential @xmath0-parity violation is also easily demonstrated and appears to be just as natural as not .",
    "as is well known , the conventional gauge symmetries of the supersymmetric extension of the sm allow for the existence of additional terms in the superpotential that violate either baryon(@xmath8 ) and/or lepton(@xmath9 ) number .",
    "one quickly realizes that simultaneous existence of such terms leads to rapid proton decay .",
    "these phenomenologically dangerous terms can be written as @xmath10 where @xmath11 are family indices and symmetry demands that @xmath12 in the terms proportional to @xmath13(@xmath14 ) yukawa couplings . in the mssm ,",
    "the imposition of the discrete symmetry of @xmath0-parity removes by brute force all of these ` undesirable ' couplings from the superpotential .",
    "however , it easy to construct alternative discrete symmetries which may arise from strings that allow for the existence of either the @xmath9- or @xmath8-violating terms  @xcite in @xmath15 ( but not both kinds ) and are just as likely to exist as @xmath0-parity itself .",
    "( interestingly , at least some , if not all , of these dangerous couplings in @xmath15 may be removed from the superpotential if the sm fields also carry an additional set of @xmath5 quantum numbers@xcite . )",
    "as far as we know there exists no strong theoretical reason to favor the mssm realization over such @xmath0-parity violating scenarios .",
    "since only @xmath8- or @xmath9-violating terms survive when this new symmetry is present the proton now remains stable in these models .",
    "consequently , various low - energy phenomena then provide the only significant constraints  @xcite on the yukawa couplings @xmath16 and @xmath14 .",
    "for example , constraints on the trilinear @xmath17 couplings are typically of order @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the mass of the exchanged sfermion . in",
    "what follows we will be interested in @xmath20 masses in the tev range so that yukawa couplings not much less than unity can be phenomenologically viable .",
    "if @xmath0-parity is violated much of the conventional wisdom associated with the phenomenology of the mssm goes by the wayside , , the lsp ( now not necessarily a neutralino ! ) is unstable and sparticles may now be produced singly .",
    "in particular , it is possible that the exchange of sparticles can significantly modify sm processes and may even be produced as @xmath21-channel resonances , appearing as bumps  @xcite in cross sections if they are kinematically accessible . below threshold , these new spin-0 exchanges may make their presence known via indirect effects on cross sections and other observables even when they occur in the @xmath22- or @xmath23-channels@xcite . here",
    "we will address the question of whether the effects of the exchange of such particles can be differentiated from those conventionally associated with a @xmath7 .",
    "( recall the expectation that at linear colliders such as the nlc , the effects of a @xmath7 with a mass in the several tev range will appear as deviations from the sm values for observables associated with the processes @xmath24 . )    in many cases it will be quite straightforward to differentiate these two alternative sources of new physics .",
    "for example , if a new resonance is actually produced and is found to dominantly decay to susy partners , including gauginos , or violate lepton number , we will know immediately that the new particle is most probably a sfermion with couplings that result from @xmath0-parity violation .",
    "if , on the otherhand , such a particle were to be produced at a lepton or hadron collider and dominantly decay to sm fields , the angular distribution of the final state products , either leptons or jets , would conclusively tell us@xcite the spin of the resonance given sufficient statistics , , several hundred events .",
    "we will not be concerned with this scenario below .",
    "the situation becomes far more uncertain , however , when below threshold exchanges are involved and the existence of the interaction produced by the new particle is uncovered _ only _ through its modification of cross sections and asymmetries for sm processes . as an example , both a leptophobic @xmath7 and a squark coupling via the @xmath8-violating @xmath25 term in @xmath15 can alter the angular distribution of dijets via an @xmath21-channel exchange below threshold at the tevatron .",
    "it is _ not _ so obvious that these two scenarios can be easily , if at all , distinguished by a detailed analysis of these deviations .",
    "since we are concerned here with nlc physics we will by necessity limit our attention solely to the trilinear @xmath9-violating terms in the superpotential .",
    "if only the @xmath17 terms are present it is clear that only the observables associated with leptonic processes will be affected by the exchange of @xmath20 s in the @xmath21- or @xmath22-channels or both and no input into the analysis from hadron collider experiments is possible . on the otherhand ,",
    "if @xmath26 terms are also present then the @xmath27 final states at linear colliders will also potentially be affected by @xmath20 exchange .",
    "simultaneously a @xmath20 resonance may show up at a hadron collider in the drell - yan or dijet channels if kinematically allowed and the yukawa couplings to first generation down - type quarks is sizeable . in the analysis below",
    "we will consider for simplicity only the former situation ; the extension of our analysis to the more general case involving final state quarks is quite straightforward .",
    "this implies that we will be directly comparing the @xmath21-channel exchange of an essentially hadrophobic @xmath7 with @xmath20 exchanges .",
    "how does a generic @xmath7 couple to leptons ? in most gut - type models , @xmath7 couplings are both flavor diagonal and universal , , generation independent .",
    "however , it is easy to construct more generalized models@xcite where the @xmath7 couplings remain flavor diagonal but are rendered generation - dependent .",
    "it is this specific class of @xmath7 models which we will consider below since they mimic @xmath20 s most closely .",
    "thus , while observing _",
    "different _ deviations in the @xmath28 and @xmath29 processes might be considered a unique @xmath0-parity violating signature , we see here that this need not be generally true , , universality violation is not necessarily a smoking gun signal for @xmath0-parity violation .",
    "[ snus1 ]    [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the organization of this paper is as follows . in section 2 of this paper",
    "we consider the case where the @xmath20 is exchanged in the @xmath22-channel leading to modifications in the reactions @xmath30 and/or @xmath29 . @xmath21-channel exchange is discussed in section 3 and bhabha scattering in section 4 .",
    "our summary and conclusions can be found in section 5 .",
    "we note that although we have only considered the case of @xmath0-parity exchanges in the @xmath21- and/or @xmath22-channels in this paper the analysis we follow can be easily adapted to other possible scalar ( or higher spin ) exchanges .",
    "in this section we will compare and contrast the @xmath21-channel @xmath7 contribution to @xmath30 or @xmath29 with that of a @xmath20 in the @xmath22-channel . to be specific , in the numerical analysis that follows we will consider a 1 tev nlc with an integrated luminosity of @xmath31 .",
    "the extension to other colliders with different center of mass energies and integrated luminosities is straightforward and can be partially obtained through a simple scaling relations@xcite . with this luminosity",
    "almost all errors will be statistically dominated .",
    "following@xcite the notational conventions of kalinowski , the differential cross section for the process @xmath32 , where @xmath33 or @xmath34 , allowing for possible @xmath22-channel @xmath20 or @xmath21-channel @xmath7 exchange , can be written as @xmath35 , the angle with respect to the @xmath36 beam and @xmath37 where @xmath38 provides an adequate approximation when @xmath39 , @xmath40 with @xmath41 , @xmath42 , with @xmath13 being the relevant yukawa coupling from the superpotential , and the @xmath43 and @xmath7 gauge couplings are normalized such that @xmath44 and @xmath45 with @xmath46 and @xmath47 . by ` @xmath48 ' in the equation above we mean that we may choose either term , , the term after the first @xmath48 corresponds to a potential @xmath7 contribution while that after the second @xmath48 arises due to @xmath22-channel @xmath20 exchange .",
    "in addition , we note that the parameter @xmath49 in the expression above represents the polarization of the incoming electron beam , which we take to be @xmath50 in our analysis below ( although it s specific value will not be too important as we will soon see ) .",
    "this single beam polarization allows us to construct a @xmath51-dependent left - right asymmetry , @xmath52 : latexmath:[\\[a_{lr}(z)={(1+z)^2\\{|f^s_{lr}|^2-|f^s_{rl}|^2\\}+(1-z)^2\\{|f^s_{ll}|^2 -|f^s_{rr}|^2\\}\\over { ( 1+z)^2\\{|f^s_{lr}|^2+|f^s_{rl}|^2\\}+(1-z)^2\\ {     for a @xmath7 or @xmath20 with fixed couplings the first question one must address is the search reach for either particle assuming that only one of the @xmath54 or @xmath29 final states is affected . in the @xmath7 case ,",
    "this result is essentially already documented@xcite ; for typical coupling strengths the search reach for a @xmath7 is @xmath55 with the lower end of the range being the most relevant in our case due to the fact that only leptonic observables of a given flavor are now employed to set the limit . a similar analysis following",
    "an identical approach leads to fig.1 which shows the corresponding reach for @xmath20 exchange in the @xmath22-channel . as in the @xmath7 case , for a fixed coupling strength",
    "we examine the deviations in the binned distributions for both the conventional production cross section as well as @xmath52 as functions of the @xmath20 mass accounting for both statistical and systematic errors after angular acceptance cuts of @xmath56 are imposed .",
    "lepton identification efficiencies of @xmath57 are assumed for all three generations .",
    "the dominant systematic errors in the case of lepton final states are those associated with uncertainties in the machine luminosity and the beam polarization which we take from ref.@xcite .",
    "as we lower the @xmath20 mass from some initially very large value , the new physics effects become sufficiently large in comparison to the anticipated errors that the discovery of some type of new physics can be claimed . for more details of this procedure",
    "see ref.@xcite .",
    "it is important to remember that these search reaches are _ only _ telling us that new physics beyond the sm is definitely present but not what its nature may be .",
    "it is clear that only for a somewhat lighter @xmath7 or @xmath20 would sufficient statistics be available to differentiate the two new physics sources .    the angular distribution and @xmath52 provide us with potential tools to attack this problem .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath52 and/or the angular averaged quantity , @xmath58 , is numerically small at @xmath59 tev and relatively poorly determined with integrated luminosities of @xmath31 .",
    "for example , in the sm one finds @xmath60 assuming only statistical errors . in the numerical examples we will consider below , @xmath58 is found to vary by no more than @xmath61 from this sm value and is thus not a good discriminator between @xmath7 and @xmath20 exchanges .",
    "this leaves us solely with the angular distribution with which to work and we will thus neglect the effects associated with single beam polarization in what follows .",
    "we note , however , that if @xmath20 exchange were to modify hadronic final states via the @xmath26 term in the superpotential we would find a significantly larger and much more useful value of @xmath58 for those states .    at first glance",
    "one would think that these two new physics models are easily separable since the exchanges are in distinct channels .",
    "this is true provided we are reasonably sensitive to the @xmath22-dependent part of the @xmath20 propagator which would certainly not be the case if we were in the the contact interaction limit , , @xmath62 .",
    "( as we will see below , this parameter space region is quite large . )",
    "how does @xmath7 and @xmath20 exchange influence the angular distributions ?",
    "fig.2 shows the bin - integrated angular distribution for the @xmath0-parity violating case assuming @xmath63 and a @xmath20 mass of 3 tev in comparison to that for the sm .",
    "here we see the general feature that at large positive @xmath51 the two distributions completely agree but the @xmath20 exchange causes a depletion of events with negative @xmath51 .",
    "we note from the figure that this depletion is clearly statistically meaningful .",
    "this result will hold for all interesting mass and coupling values and thus we learn that if an _ increase _ of the angular distribution is observed for negative @xmath51 the new physics that accounts for it _ can not _ arise from @xmath0-parity violation and may be attributable to a @xmath7 .    in the @xmath7 case assuming a fixed gauged boson mass",
    ", we have four couplings that we can freely vary , , @xmath64 .",
    "for simplicity we will assume that all these couplings have the same magnitude ( but we strongly emphasize that this need not be the case ) , , @xmath65 , and in this case the four possible relative sign combinations can lead to quite different angular distributions as shown in fig.3 .",
    "here we see that depending on the choice of relative signs , the @xmath7 exchange can lead to positive or negative modifications in the distribution in both the positive and negative ranges of @xmath51 .",
    "clearly if these four couplings were allowed to vary freely almost any reasonable shift in the distribution could be obtainable .",
    "we would thus expect that some choice of @xmath7 couplings could be made to completely simulate the @xmath20 signal .",
    "how would the analysis then proceed ?",
    "the exact form of the angular distribution given above suggests the following approach : once deviations in the distribution are observed a two parameter fit of the data could be performed to a trial distribution of the form @xmath66 where from the exact expression above we see that @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "a fit to this distribution may isolate whether the new physics occurs in the value of coefficient @xmath69 , @xmath8 , or both . in the sm and @xmath7 cases both @xmath69 and @xmath8 are constants , but @xmath8 picks up an additional @xmath51 dependence in the case of @xmath20 exchange . if this additional @xmath51 dependence is strong , , we are not in the contact interaction limit , then the @xmath70 of the fit assuming a constant @xmath8 in the case of @xmath20 exchange will be poor .",
    "let us consider the ` data ' as shown in figs . 2 and 3 as input into this analysis for purposes of demonstration ;",
    "the result of the fitting procedure for these sample cases is shown in fig.4 .",
    "here we see that all five sets of ` data ' lie quite a distance from the sm point clearly indicating the presence of new physics at a high confidence level . in the case of @xmath20 exchange",
    "we see that the value of @xmath69 arising from the fit is in excellent agreement with the expectations of the sm , while in the @xmath7 case the values of both @xmath69 and @xmath8 have been altered .",
    "note that all five allowed regions are statistically well separated from each other .",
    "futhermore , in all cases the resulting confidence level ( cl ) of the fits are very good indicating no special sensitivity to any variation in the value of @xmath8 with @xmath51 for @xmath20 exchange .",
    "( numerically , we find the bin - averaged value of @xmath8 to vary between 0.546 and 0.518 as we go from large negative to large positive @xmath51 . ) given the distribution of the @xmath7 results one can imagine that a suitably chosen conspiratorial set of values for the couplings @xmath71 could lead to a substantial overlap with the extracted @xmath20 coupling region in which case the two new physics sources would not be distinguishable . except for this conspiratorial region , however , it would appear that the fits to the angular distribution do provide a technique to separate these two sm extensions .",
    "as discussed above , when the value of @xmath72 becomes sufficiently large it will become apparent that the fit with a constant @xmath8 will no longer provide a good fit .",
    "exactly when does this happen ? to address this question we vary both @xmath13 and the @xmath20 mass and perform a multitude of fits assuming that @xmath69 and @xmath8 are constant and obtain the confidence level of the best fit for each case .",
    "the result of this analysis is shown in fig.5 . in this figure",
    "we see that typically one finds that this type of fit begins to fail in a qualitative way when @xmath73 . for much smaller values of this parameter , as in the sample case above",
    ", the data will be insensitive to the nature of the @xmath22-channel exchange and we will be living in the contact interaction limit of parameter space .",
    "how does this bound scale with the collider energy ?",
    "since the @xmath74channel @xmath20 exchange interferes directly with the sm contribution , assuming that most of the error is statistical in origin , we expect the bound on the ratio @xmath72 to roughly scale as @xmath75 , where @xmath9 in the integrated luminosity and @xmath21 in the machine center of mass energy .",
    "when a @xmath7 or @xmath20 are exchanged in the @xmath21-channel , the general form of the cross section with a polarized electron beam can be written as : @xmath76 where @xmath77 are obtainable above and @xmath78 with @xmath79 in the same limit as employed above .",
    "our first step here is to determine the search reach for a @xmath20 being exchanged in the @xmath21-channel .",
    "our standard analysis yields the results shown in fig.6 ; note that the search reach for a fixed value of @xmath80 is somewhat larger in the @xmath22-channel than in the @xmath21-channel but generally comparable in magnitude . note that here @xmath81 , with @xmath82 being the values of the yukawa couplings for the @xmath20 to initial state electrons and the fermion @xmath83 in the final state .    as before a short analysis demonstrates that single beam polarization will not help distinguish these two new physics models due the small value of the resulting asymmetry , so we set @xmath84 and again examine the angular distribution .",
    "first , we note that when a @xmath20 is exchanged in the @xmath21-channel the angular distribution picks up a constant , , @xmath51-independent term : @xmath85 with @xmath86 given as before and here @xmath87 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "as expected , when the value of the constant @xmath88 is sufficiently large it will become apparent that the resulting fit which assumes that only @xmath69 and @xmath8 are present is no longer valid due to an increase in @xmath70 and a lower confidence level .",
    "however , for moderate coupling strengths we find that it is possible to adjust the values of @xmath69 and @xmath8 to mask the contributions of the @xmath88 term . in fig.7",
    "we show the cl obtained by performing a large number of fits to the parameters @xmath69 and @xmath8 for different values of both @xmath80 and the @xmath20 mass from generating ` data ' samples via monte carlo . for small @xmath80 s or large masses , as in the above example",
    ", we see that the cl of the fit is always quite good . in the opposite limit",
    ", the fit fails and the cl is quite small .",
    "typically , we see that the fit begins to fail qualitatively when @xmath89 .",
    "this reach in coupling - mass parameter space is not very good and so we seek other observables with which to extend our reach .    in the case",
    "where a @xmath34 pair is being produced in the final state we can employ a clever idea used by bar - shalom , eilam and soni(bes)@xcite in a somewhat different context .",
    "if the @xmath34 spins can be analyzed , a spin - spin correlation can be formed which is sensitive to the spin of any new particle exchanged in the @xmath21-channel .",
    "integrating over all production angles , this quantity can be written as an asymmetry : latexmath:[\\[b_{zz}={|f^s_{lr}|^2+|f^s_{lr}|^2+|f^s_{lr}|^2+|f^s_{lr}|^2- { 3\\over { 4}}(|f^t_{ll}|^2+|f^t_{rr}|^2)\\over { |f^s_{lr}|^2+|f^s_{lr}|^2 +    where we see immediately that for the case of the sm or a @xmath7 one obtains @xmath91 whereas a @xmath20 exchange in the @xmath21-channel will force this observable to smaller , even negative values .",
    "in fig.8 we display the value of the asymmetry @xmath92 as a function of the @xmath20 mass for several values of @xmath80 .",
    "even if the efficiency for making this spin - spin correlation measurement is only @xmath93 , the anticipated statistical error on this quantity will be of order @xmath94 since there are about 9000 @xmath34-pairs in the data sample .",
    "thus a value of @xmath92 below @xmath95 would provide a very strong indication that there is a scalar exchange in the @xmath21-channel . from the figure we see",
    "that this implies that the parameter space region @xmath96 would certainly be probed by such measurements .",
    "unfortunately , this technique does not help us in the case of a corresponding @xmath22-channel exchange .",
    "it is apparent that for non-@xmath34 pair final states we can not use this trick . while we have already observed that single beam polarization is not useful , if _ both _",
    "initial beams can be polarized@xcite more observables can be investigated . in this case ,",
    "integration over @xmath51 gives the following expression for the cross section with two polarized beams : @xmath97\\{|f^s_{lr}|^2+|f^s_{ll}|^2\\}+[rr]\\{|f^s_{rl}|^2 + |f^s_{rr}|^2\\}+{3\\over { 4}}[lr]\\{|f^t_{ll}|^2+|f^t_{rr}|^2\\}\\,,\\ ] ] where we have employed the notation @xcite , @xmath98 } & = & { 1\\over { 4}}[1+p_1+p_2+p_1p_2]\\ , , \\nonumber \\\\ { [ rr ] } & = & { 1\\over { 4}}[1-p_1-p_2+p_1p_2]\\ , , \\nonumber \\\\ { [ lr ] } & = & { 1\\over { 2}}[1-p_1p_2]\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath99 being the polarizations of the incoming electron and positron beam respectively . from these cross sections a double polarization asymmetry can be obtained : @xmath100 let us assume that @xmath101 while @xmath102 as given in ref.@xcite ; we then calculate @xmath103 readily and obtain a value of 0.585 for both the sm and when a @xmath7 is present . however ,",
    "as in the case of @xmath92 , the presence of @xmath20 exchange in the @xmath21-channel can lead to significantly smaller values of @xmath103 .",
    "it is interesting to note that this double polarization asymmetry would not have helped in the case of @xmath22-channel @xmath20 exchange since it and the @xmath7 contribute to the same amplitudes .",
    "fig.9 shows the set of results obtained for @xmath103 in this case as a function of the mass of the @xmath20 assuming various values for the yukawa coupling @xmath80 . since the statistical error on @xmath103",
    "is again expected to be somewhat less than @xmath94 for our assumed integrated luminosity ( a value of @xmath104 is obtained for the sm ) it is clear that for values of @xmath96 , a statistically significant signal for scalar @xmath21-channel exchange will be observed .",
    "this reach is quite comparable to that obtained using the double spin asymmetry technique discussed above and is superior to that found by an examination of the angular distribution alone .",
    "how does this bound scale with the collider energy ?",
    "since the @xmath105channel @xmath20 exchange does not directly interfere with the sm contribution , assuming that most of the error is statistical in origin , we expect the bound on the ratio @xmath72 to roughly scale as @xmath106 , where @xmath9 in the integrated luminosity and @xmath21 in the machine center of mass energy .",
    "bhabha scattering represents the most difficult case of the ones we have considered since @xmath107 and @xmath43 exchanges are already present in both the @xmath21- and @xmath22-channels in the sm and in fact the @xmath22-channel @xmath107 pole dominates . allowing for @xmath21- and @xmath22-channel @xmath7 or @xmath20 exchange for the case where both electron and positron beams are polarized ,",
    "the differential cross section can be written as @xmath108|f^s_{lr}|^2 + [ rr]|f^s_{rl}|^2+[ll]|f^t_{lr}|^2   + [ rr]|f^t_{rl}|^2\\right .",

    "the search reaches for a @xmath7 or @xmath20 in this channel are found to be very comparable to that of the case of @xmath21-channel exchange discussed above .    to examine this cross section in any detail ,",
    "angular cuts are necessary due to the photon pole in the forward direction .",
    "we first employ a weak cut of @xmath111 , corresponding to @xmath112 , which is motivated by detector requirements@xcite .",
    "this has little effect in the backward direction and leaves an enormous rate in the forward direction . to further tame the cross section in this direction",
    "we strengthen this cut to @xmath113 to remove more of the photon pole .",
    "the result of this procedure for the sm and for the case of a 3 tev @xmath20 with @xmath63 is shown in fig.10 for a @xmath114 tev nlc assuming unpolarized beams and an integrated luminosity of @xmath31 .",
    "as one might expect , the distribution in the far forward direction is overwhelmingly dominated by the photon pole and hence there is no signal for new physics there even with the large statistics available . in the backwards direction ,",
    "the @xmath20 exchange is seen to lead to a characteristic and statistically significant increase in the cross section above that predicted by the sm . since @xmath20 exchange can only increase the cross section in the backward region , any observed decrease in the cross section",
    "may be attributable to a @xmath7 .",
    "as can be seen in fig.11 , when the product of @xmath7 couplings @xmath115 , the resulting cross section is seen to increase(decrease ) in this case .    from this discussion",
    "it is clear that using the bhabha scattering angular distribution alone it will be possible to easily distinguish new physics in the form of a @xmath20 from a @xmath7 when @xmath116 .",
    "when the product of @xmath7 couplings have the opposite sign we need to use an additional observable .",
    "one immediate possibility is to employ @xmath103 as defined above in the case that both initial beams are polarized .",
    "however , due to the dominance of the photon pole at @xmath117 we limit ourselves to events with @xmath118 ; for the sm this corresponds to about 7000 events when the integrated luminosity is 150 @xmath119 at a 1 tev nlc after isr and gives @xmath120 , obtained by taking @xmath121 and @xmath122 as in the discussion above .",
    "a scan of the @xmath13 and @xmath20 mass parameter space leads us to the observation that @xmath20 exchange always decreases the value of the asymmetry from that obtained in the case of the sm . @xmath7",
    "exchange also modifies the value of this asymmetry ; unfortunately we find that for @xmath123 , @xmath103 also decreases as it does for the case of @xmath20 exchange .",
    "thus @xmath103 does not help us resolve this potential ambiguity in the case of bhabha scattering .",
    "in this paper we have considered the problem of how to distinguish two potential new physics scenarios from each other below the threshold for direct production of new particles at the nlc : @xmath0-parity violation and a extension of the sm gauge group by an additional @xmath5 factor . both kinds of new physics can lead to qualitatively similar alterations in sm cross sections , angular distributions and various asymmetries but differ in detail .",
    "these detailed differences provide the key to the two major weapons that are useful in accomplishing our task : ( @xmath124 ) the angular distribution of the final state fermion and ( @xmath125 ) an asymmetry formed by polarizing both beams in the initial state , @xmath103 .",
    "the traditional asymmetry , @xmath58 , formed when only a single beam is polarized , was shown not to be useful for the case of purely leptonic processes we considered , but will be useful in an extension of the analysis to hadronic final states . this same analysis employed above can be easily extended to other new physics scenarios which involve the exchange on new particles@xcite as in the case of massive graviton exchange in theories with compactified dimensions .      the author would like to thank j.l .",
    "hewett , s. bar - shalom and members of the future @xmath126 linear collider new phenomena working group for discussions related to this analysis .",
    "the author would also like to thank j. conway and the rutgers physics department for their hospitality .",
