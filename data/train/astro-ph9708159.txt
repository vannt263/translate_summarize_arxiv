    "1997 ) , and radio ( frail et al . 1997 ) emission , over hours to several months following @xmath2-ray bursts ( grb ) established a new class of variable sources in astronomy .",
    "of particular significance is the detection of feii and mgii absorption lines at a redshift of @xmath3 in the optical spectrum of grb970508 ( metzger et al .",
    "1997 ) , which confirmed the extragalactic origin of this burst .",
    "since the source redshift must be higher than the absorber redshift , its required optical luminosity exceeds that of a supernova by several orders of magnitude .",
    "thus , grb afterglows might be detectable out to high redshifts .",
    "one could then use the signatures of absorption in the optical band ( metzger et al .",
    "1997 ; djorgovski et al .",
    "1997 ) , scintillations in the radio regime ( goodman 1997 ) , or gravitational lensing ( gould 1992 ; mao 1993 ) by intervening material along the line - of - sight , to study the intrinsic properties of afterglow sources .",
    "afterglows are most naturally explained by models in which the bursts are produced by relativistically expanding fireballs ( paczyski & rhoads 1993 ; meszaros & rees 1997 ; vietri 1996 ; waxman 1997a , b ; wijers , rees , & meszaros 1997 ; vietri 1997 ; sari 1997 ) . on encountering an external medium , the relativistic shell which emitted the initial grb decelerates and converts its bulk kinetic energy to synchrotron radiation , giving rise to the afterglow .",
    "the combined radio and optical data imply that the fireball energy is @xmath4 erg . due to relativistic beaming",
    ", the emission region seen by an external observer , occupies an angle @xmath5 relative to the center of the explosion , where @xmath2 is the lorentz factor .",
    "this region appears to expand faster than the speed of light and occupies an angle of @xmath6 micro - arcseconds on the sky ( or a physical size of @xmath7@xmath8 ) . due to the smallness of this angular size",
    ", it is difficult to resolve the afterglow source by terrestrial telescopes .",
    "however , the lensing zone of a solar mass lens located at cosmological distances occupies a micro - arcsecond on the sky ( hence the term `` microlensing '' ) , and thus offers the unique opportunity for resolving grb sources during their afterglow phase . because of the superluminal expansion of the source , any ( non - relativistic ) peculiar velocity of the lens relative to the source can be ignored .",
    "the amplification peak of a microlensing event lasts for only @xmath9 day , after which the net amplification weakens as the source size grows larger than the einstein radius of the lens .",
    "the short duration of a microlensing event could therefore provide a test for the high lorentz factor of the afterglow photosphere , which is predicted by all fireball models ( for comparison , the variations due to peculiar velocities in microlensing events of steady sources take decades rather than days ) .",
    "the rapid expansion and deceleration of the fireball causes a sharp decline in its surface brightness as a function of time .",
    "since emission along the line - of - sight to the source center suffers from the shortest geometric time - delay , it occurs at larger radii and appears dimmer relative to slightly off - axis emission . at",
    "any given time , the source is expected to appear as a narrow ring of radius @xmath10 and a width of order a tenth of this radius ( waxman 1997c ) . the outer cut - off is set by the sharp decline in relativistic beaming outside the ring . as the ring crosses a lens",
    ", its magnification adds a sharp peak to the otherwise smooth light curve of the afterglow .",
    "the sharpness of the peak depends on the thickness of the radiating gas layer behind the shock and on the shock deceleration rate .",
    "microlensing could therefore provide important information about the structure and dynamics of the afterglow photosphere .",
    "the probability for stellar microlensing of a source at a redshift @xmath11 is @xmath12 ( press & gunn 1973 ; gould 1995 ) , where @xmath13 is the mean density of stellar - mass objects in the universe in units of the critical density , and @xmath14 is the impact parameter of the source relative to the lens in units of the einstein radius .",
    "the known population of luminous stars amounts to @xmath15 ( woods & loeb 1997 ) , and implies that most cosmological sources are separated from stellar lenses by @xmath16 .",
    "the typical impact parameter is smaller by an order of magnitude if the dark matter is made of massive compact halo objects ( machos ) as galactic microlensing searches suggest ( alcock et al .",
    "1996 ) .    in this paper",
    "we examine the question whether a stellar mass lens can resolve the predicted properties of afterglow photospheres . for concreteness",
    ", we derive numerical results for the fireball emission model of waxman ( 1997b , c ) .",
    "since the afterglow occurs long after the explosive energy release , its properties are not sensitive to the spatial or temporal details of the point explosion that triggered the grb .",
    "however , our adopted emission model is by no means a unique interpretation of the existing afterglow data ( see , e.g. vietri 1997 or paczyski 1997 ) ; in fact , a future detection of a microlensing signal could serve to discriminate among competing afterglow models .    in  2",
    "we describe our model for grb afterglows and characterize both the intensity and polarization signals that would result from a microlensing event .",
    "the numerical results and their implications are discussed in  3 . finally , ",
    "4 summarizes the main conclusions from this work .",
    "to illustrate the effects of microlensing on grb afterglows we need to specify the evolution of the source size and spectral intensity with time .",
    "we adopt the scaling laws for the expansion and emission of a relativistic fireball which decelerates in a uniform ambient medium ( waxman 1997b ) .    in the fireball model ,",
    "a compact ( @xmath17 cm ) source , releases an energy of @xmath18 ergs over @xmath19 seconds with a negligible baryonic contamination ( @xmath20 ) . the high energy density at the source results in an optically thick pair plasma that expands and accelerates to relativistic velocities .",
    "after an initial acceleration phase , the thermal energy is converted to kinetic energy of the protons .",
    "a cold shell of thickness @xmath21 is formed and continues to expand .",
    "internal shell collisions as a result of unsteady source activity could convert part of kinetic energy into radiation and yield the primary grb emission via synchrotron emission and inverse - compton scattering ( paczyski & xu 1993 ; meszaros & rees 1994 ; sari & piran 1997 ) . as",
    "the cold shell expands , it impacts on the surrounding medium and drives a relativistic shock also in it ; this shock continuously heats fresh gas and accelerates relativistic electrons which produce via synchrotron emission the delayed radiation observed on time scales of hours to months . following waxman ( 1997b )",
    ", the radius of the shock at observed time @xmath22 is given by @xmath23 while its lorentz factor is @xmath24 here @xmath25 is the fireball energy in units of @xmath26 ergs , @xmath27 is the ambient gas density in @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the observed time in hours . as mentioned in  1 , most of the emission is seen from a narrow ring of radius @xmath30 the width of the ring is a fraction @xmath31 of its radius @xmath32 if the thickness of the radiating layer behind the shock is determined by the shock hydrodynamics in a self - similar expansion ( waxman 1997c ) .",
    "a thicker radiating layer ( e.g. due to a large gyroradius of the radiating electrons ) would result in a wider ring . in  3 , we will show numerical results for different choices of @xmath33 .",
    "these expressions are valid also for a jet geometry as long as the opening angle of the jet is @xmath34 .    the @xmath1-ray , optical and radio emission following the @xmath2-ray burst can be modelled as synchrotron emission from a power - law population of electrons within the heated shell behind the expanding shock . under the assumption that the magnetic field energy density in the shell rest frame is a fraction @xmath35 of the equipartition value , and that the power - law electrons carry a fraction @xmath36 of the dissipated energy , the observed frequency",

    "other analytic results exist for more general surface brightness distributions ( heyrovsk & loeb 1997 ) .      if the afterglow photosphere contains a finite set of discrete patches , each having a coherent magnetic field distribution , then the emergent synchrotron radiation will be polarized . for a power - law distribution of electron energies with an index @xmath73",
    ", the degree of linear polarization in each coherent patch is given by ( rybicki & lightman 1979 ) @xmath74 for the inferred value of @xmath75 ( waxman 1997b ) , @xmath76 .",
    "a microlens capable of resolving the source , could then provide useful information about its magnetic field structure .    to illustrate the effect of microlensing on polarization we adopt a toy model in which the emission ring is divided into a set of independent segments , each having a coherent distribution of magnetic field lines .",
    "the polarization in each segment is then modelled as a traceless symmetric @xmath77 tensor with a random orientation angle , and a contraction @xmath78 , given by equation  ( [ eq : pi ] ) . to simplify the computation",
    ", we subdivide the emission ring into @xmath79 segments of equal area and nearly square shape .",
    "to each segment we assign a randomly oriented linear polarization . for the sake of concreteness",
    ", we assume that the number of segments and the orientation of their polarization stays constant during the lensing event .",
    "this assumption is reasonable since the effect of lensing peaks during the short period of time when the ring crosses the lens ( which is smaller than the expansion time by a factor @xmath80 ) .",
    "the net observed polarization is then given by @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the area and polarization tensor of the @xmath84-th segment , and @xmath85 with a random orientation angle , @xmath86 .",
    "we first consider the case where there is no lensing , in which @xmath87 for @xmath88 .",
    "the two components of the net polarization are then given by @xmath89 clearly , the resulting polarization @xmath90 approaches zero for large @xmath79 and is time independent .",
    "let us now consider the situation where a lens is located at a projected position @xmath91 with respect to the center of the source , so that @xmath92 .",
    "the observed polarization is still given by equation  ( [ eq : pol ] ) but due to the stretching caused by lensing , the areas @xmath93 of the various segments are no longer equal , @xmath94 where @xmath95 are polar coordinates centered on the source , and the integrand is the point - source amplification factor at an impact parameter @xmath96^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "the integral is taken over the unlensed area of the segments . because the size and position of the various segments relative to the lens change with time , the observed polarization will vary during a microlensing event .",
    "the solid lines in figure 1 show the unlensed @xmath97hz flux of an afterglow according to equation  ( [ eq : fnu ] ) and the parameter choices mentioned below that equation .",
    "the broken lines show the effect of microlensing on the observed flux , according to equation  ( [ eq : flens ] ) , for different choices of the ring s fractional width @xmath33 and impact parameter @xmath14 .",
    "the qualitative features of the microlensing signature on the afterglow lightcurve are as follows :    * all wavelengths show the same amplification profile as a function of time .",
    "while the amplification peak occurs on the rising side of the lightcurve in the radio , it appears on its declining side in x - rays , and might show on both sides of the break in the optical [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : num ] ) for the timing of the peak at a given frequency ] .",
    "the larger @xmath14 is , the easier it becomes to detect the amplification signal at longer wavelengths .",
    "for example , the optimal frequencies for detecting the signals shown in figure 1c and 1d are @xmath98 ghz",
    "( sub - mm ) and @xmath99 ghz ( radio ) , respectively .",
    "the achromaticity of the amplification peak can be used to separate the lensing signal from noise due to intrinsic variability or interstellar scintillations .",
    "detailed observations of future afterglows are necessary in order to assess the characteristic level of intrinsic variability . * at early times , the temporal profiles of the lensed and unlensed fluxes have the same shape but different amplitudes . during this period",
    ", the source can still be regarded as pointlike and the offset between the lensed and unlensed curves is set by the point source magnification factor at a constant @xmath14 .",
    "the unknown value of @xmath14 could therefore be inferred from this asymptotic offset in amplitude between the lensed and unlensed regimes . *",
    "the maximum amplification occurs at the time @xmath100 when the ring crosses the lens , namely when @xmath101 .",
    "the otherwise unknown source size @xmath70 can therefore be inferred at the time @xmath100 . by taking the ratio between the ring size and the period @xmath100",
    ", one finds the mean velocity of the expanding ring during that time interval in units of the einstein radius , @xmath102 .",
    "given a probability distribution for @xmath102 ( based on a reasonable mass and redshift distribution for the lenses ) , one could then test the hypothesis of superluminal expansion . *",
    "analysis of the shape of the lightcurve after the peak can provide more detailed information about the fractional width of the ring @xmath33 and the temporal history of @xmath103 .",
    "the smaller @xmath33 is , the higher and narrower the amplification peak gets .",
    "when @xmath101 , the value of the magnification @xmath104 becomes highly sensitive to the source size @xmath70 . by monitoring the lensed flux as a function of time , one could infer the magnification @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is found from the power - law extrapolation of the observed @xmath107 after the end of the microlensing event , to earlier times .",
    "based on the magnification history @xmath108 one could infer the time evolution of @xmath103 from the constraint @xmath109 , where @xmath104 is given by equation  ( [ eq : mu ] ) and @xmath14 is inferred based on point ( b ) above .",
    "the quantitative interpretation of the lensing signatures suffers from an ambiguity about the physical size of the einstein radius of the lens .",
    "this ambiguity can be removed through a parallax experiment , in which two ( or more ) telescopes , separated across the solar system , observe the same microlensing event with different values of @xmath14 ( grieger , kayser , & refsdal 1986 ; gould 1994 ) . since variability is induced by the superluminal expansion of the source ( rather than by the motion of the lens , as is usually the case in microlensing events of steady sources )",
    ", the two telescopes would simply observe different lightcurves with different values of @xmath14 .",
    "based on their known separation and their inferred @xmath14 values [ see point ( b ) ] one could then measure the physical size of the einstein radius , @xmath59 .",
    "the shape of the different peaks measured by the two telescopes can be used to test for self - similarity in the shock structure and dynamics .",
    "the different lines in figure 2 show the deviation from the steady polarization signal that is predicted by equation  ( [ eq : pol0 ] ) , due to microlensing [ eqs .",
    "( [ eq : pol ] ) and ( [ eq : aij ] ) ] .",
    "the different panels show several random realizations for various choices of the lens - source separation @xmath14 , and the number of ring segments @xmath79 .",
    "we consider two values of @xmath79 , one in which the ring is composed of a single radial strip composed of nearly square segments ( @xmath110 ) , and a second in which it is divided into two such strips ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "the particular value that the polarization obtains at any given time @xmath22 depends on the specific set of random orientation angles @xmath112 that were assigned to the segments in each realization , and so the fluctuations induced by lensing should be analyzed on a statistical basis only .",
    "the main qualitative characteristics of the lensing signal are :    * the polarization changes around @xmath113 in coincidence with the flux amplification peak . at that time",
    ", the polarization fluctuates because as the ring expands , different segments approach the lens ( and hence the point of maximum amplification ) at different times . at",
    "any given time , the segment which crosses the lens obtains the largest area in the image plane and provides the largest contribution to the overall polarization .",
    "the fluctuation rate increases as the area of each individual segment gets smaller ( or as @xmath79 gets larger ) , because smaller segments sweep faster across the lens .",
    "* if the ring is narrower than the einstein diameter at lens crossing ( i.e. @xmath114 ) , then the typical fluctuation amplitude , @xmath115 , is roughly independent of @xmath79 ( see top panels of fig .",
    "2 ) . in this case",
    ", the ring is sliced into a fixed number of `` effective '' segments , each having a length of order the einstein diameter , so that @xmath116 , and @xmath117 . *",
    "the fluctuation amplitude decreases with increasing @xmath14 , because in this limit the highly - magnified zone behind the lens amounts to a smaller fraction of the entire ring area .",
    "we have shown that microlensing by stars can be used to study the size , superluminal expansion rate , and granularity of the photospheres of grb afterglows .",
    "the light curves shown in figure 1 can be used to extract the source impact parameter @xmath14 relative to the lens ( based on the normalization offset between the pre- and post - lensing curves ) , the fractional width of the emission ring ( from the height and width of the amplification peak ) , and the source expansion rate and size in units of the einstein radius of the lens .",
    "the source size can be measured explicitly through a parallax experiment which would obtain two ( or more ) light curves that sample the achromatic amplification peak at different times ( cf .",
    "1 ) . such an experiment could serve as the definitive tool for discriminating between a microlensing event and intrinsic variability of the afterglow source .    by monitoring the variability of the polarization with time during a microlensing event , it is also possible to estimate the number of coherent magnetic field patches on the afterglow photosphere ( fig .",
    "2 ) . if the cosmological density parameter of stellar mass machos is @xmath13 , then most afterglow events will acquire an impact parameter @xmath118 from their nearest lens .",
    "multi - band photometry with an accuracy of @xmath119 mag , could then detect the flux amplification signal shown in figures 1a - c and test for its achromaticity , or else place interesting upper limits on @xmath13 , based on a relatively small sample of frequently - monitored afterglows . the @xmath120 amplification signal shown in figure 1d for",
    "@xmath121 would appear in 5100% of all afterglows after 23 months , at the time when the peak flux of @xmath122 mjy is reached in the radio , at @xmath123ghz .",
    "a future x - ray satellite which would locate afterglows to within an arcminute ( like bepposax does ) for all grbs detected by batse , might identify hundreds of afterglows per year , and could provide a rich sample for such microlensing studies .",
