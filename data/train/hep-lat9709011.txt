    "from statistical mechanics we know the energy density as @xmath2 . in lattice calculations the straightforward approach to calculate this quantity is to introduce different lattice spacings @xmath3 to perform the derivatives with respect to @xmath4 at fixed physical volume @xmath5 .",
    "therefore one introduces the lattice anisotropy @xmath6 and two gauge couplings in the action , @xmath7 the energy density @xmath8 contains then the derivatives of these gauge couplings , @xmath9 where    [ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     and @xmath10 the coefficents @xmath0 and @xmath1 were calculated pertubatively in @xcite .    a different way to determine the energy density was used by the bielefeld group@xcite . the free energy density @xmath11 is obtained by integrating the difference of the plaquettes , @xmath12~.\\ ] ] in large systems , where @xmath13 , @xmath8 can be found from the pressure , @xmath14 ~ , { \\nonumber}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the relation @xmath15 and the @xmath16-function from @xmath17 measurements , we can calculate @xmath0 and @xmath1 from ( [ ener ] ) , ( [ eins ] ) and ( [ e-3p ] ) . in figure 1 the results for @xmath0 and @xmath1 are shown as solid lines .",
    "they deviate clearly from the pertubative results ( broken lines ) .",
    "however , this is expected , as also @xmath18 deviate from the pertubative result .",
    "we also note , that the method works only above @xmath19 , because both @xmath20 and @xmath8 become very small below the critical point .",
    "an attempt to determine the lattice anisotropy was made by burgers et al.@xcite .",
    "consider the anisotropic couplings @xmath21    fig.1 .  the derivatives @xmath0 and @xmath1 for the wilson action ( a ) ( @xmath22=4,6,8 ) and the 2x2-action ( b ) ( @xmath22=4 ) @xcite versus @xmath16 .",
    "the broken lines show the pertubative values@xcite .",
    "the sum @xmath18 is from the @xmath16-function .",
    "the dotted line shows an estimate form the different @xmath22-values .",
    "the single measurements are from the matching method .    of the action ( [ action ] ) . the derivatives with respect to the lattice anisotropy @xmath23 are @xmath24 which requires the function @xmath25 or @xmath26",
    "we vary the anisotropy of the couplings @xmath27 in the action @xmath28 and measure the anisotropy of the lattice spacing @xmath29 .",
    "wilson loops are suitable observables , since they depend on the physical size of the lattice . instead of matching wilson loops , measured in spatial and in temporal direction , directly , @xmath30 we match ratios of wilson loops , in order to cancel corner and selfmass contributions , @xmath31 @xmath32 since these ratios contain only wilson loops with the same extension in @xmath33 , the following matching condition holds , @xmath34    fig.2 .",
    "the ratios @xmath35 for fixed @xmath36 vs. @xmath37 , the open symbols are connected by solid lines .",
    "the ratios @xmath38 correspond to the bold face symbols and are shifted in @xmath33 by @xmath39 .    we are using a @xmath40 lattice for @xmath41 $ ] , a @xmath42 lattice for @xmath43 $ ] and a @xmath44 lattice for @xmath45 .",
    "the link integration technique of ref.@xcite is applied to obtain accurate expectation values of large wilson loops with a statistics of 2000 measurements .",
    "the value of @xmath29 was chosen in such a way , that the square deviation of @xmath46 from the lines connecting the @xmath35 measurements was minimal .",
    "for each @xmath27 we find in this way a value of @xmath29 .",
    "figure 3 shows an example for @xmath47 . in all cases we found a linear behaviour of @xmath26 .",
    "the result for @xmath29 as a function of @xmath27 for @xmath47 .",
    "the solid line is a linear fit to @xmath26 .    to obtain the derivative @xmath48 we have performed linear fits .",
    "the resulting @xmath0 are shown in figure 4 .",
    "obviously the matching procedure requires at least loops of an area eight . for larger",
    "wilson loops the results are consistent .",
    "employing a method of matching ratios of wilson loops on anisotropic lattices we have directly determined the derivatives @xmath0 and @xmath1 of the gauge couplings non - pertubatively .",
    "this has been done for both , the standard wilson action and the 2@xmath492 improved action@xcite .",
    "we found significant deviations from the pertubative result .",
    "qualitatively our results are in agreement with the indirect method used in@xcite , though they are a little lower .",
    "we assume that the difference is due to @xmath50 corrections , since they enter the two methods differently .",
    "the use of ratios of wilson loops was crucial in order to eliminate unphysical self energy contributions .",
    "the numerical matching technique for these ratios enabled us to obtain the required accuracy for @xmath29 .",

    "the solid line shows the average value for @xmath52 , the broken lines the error band ."
