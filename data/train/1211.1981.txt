    "the lhc was designed to explore electroweak symmetry breaking and search for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the recent discovery of the higgs boson  @xcite fulfills one of these goals .",
    "this discovery is a triumph for science as it profoundly deepens our understanding of the universe and completes our picture of the sm .",
    "however , many fundamental questions remain outstanding , and it is imperative that the lhc experiments continue to search for new physics that may shed some insight or , possibly , open new doors of investigation .    to date , the onslaught of lhc data has challenged our most cherished theories of new physics  @xcite . search after search further constrains the parameter space of many models , with some scenarios now being excluded .",
    "in addition , the property of naturalness is now called into question .",
    "either new physics appears at the electroweak scale , or nature has tuned the mass of the higgs boson to one part in @xmath010@xmath1 .",
    "supersymmetry ( susy ) elegantly solves this hierarchy problem and is the most motivated and well - studied theory beyond the sm  @xcite .",
    "naturalness considerations allow us to set limits on the values of parameters , given an upper bound on the level of fine - tuning permitted . in our recent work  @xcite , we showed that employing the barbieri - giudice definition  @xcite of fine - tuning suggests the existence of at least one light stop ( below @xmath01 tev ) , and implies that the higgsino mass @xmath2 and stop mixing @xmath3 are below @xmath0456 gev and @xmath02.2 tev , respectively , when requiring percent - level tuning or better . on the other hand ,",
    "a higgs mass of @xmath0126 gev in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) necessitates a large stop mass or large stop mixing to drive large radiative corrections .",
    "this spells trouble for the simplest or constrained susy models , such as msugra , which have difficulty satisfying all experimental constraints ( including the higgs mass ) while meeting the requirements for low fine - tuning .",
    "in particular , atlas and cms have placed bounds  @xcite of @xmath01.2 tev on the gluino and first and second generation squark masses in these classes of models , with the result that typical measures of fine - tuning in these scenarios are soaring to the level of one part in @xmath4 or higher .",
    "this has led to the claim that the constrained mssm ( cmssm ) paradigm is  hardly tenable \"  @xcite at this time .",
    "given this situation , it is imperative to explore the parameter space of supersymmetry in more detail , in order to leave no corner unturned .",
    "the p(henomenological)mssm is particularly well - suited to this task . in this scenario ,",
    "no specific theoretical prejudice is introduced at the gut scale , or associated with a susy breaking mechanism , and a short list of experimentally motivated considerations reduce the mssm to 19 ( or 20 ) real , weak - scale parameters , corresponding to a neutralino ( or gravitino ) lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp )  @xcite .",
    "this allows for the study of lhc results in a more general fashion , and considers mass patterns and signatures which are not possible in the cmssm and other more conventional susy scenarios .",
    "the pmssm has thus garnered much attention in the literature  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we have recently shown  @xcite that the 7 tev lhc susy searches allow for pmssm models with light gluinos and squarks , and that a 126 gev higgs is easily accommodated in minimal supersymmetric models beyond the most constrained scenarios such as msugra .",
    "in addition , we found a handful of models in a specific corner of parameter space with light stops / sbottoms and higgsinos that allows for 1% fine - tuning or better .",
    "however , the lhc experiments have recently released a plethora of new search results which encompass 8 tev updates of 7 tev results , new signatures and new techniques . here , we re - examine the pmssm in light of this new data , and determine if our previous encouraging results still stack up .",
    "in particular , we investigate whether the recently released 3rd generation lhc susy searches , involving top and bottom final states , exclude our pmssm models with light stops / sbottoms and low fine - tuning .",
    "this provides the motivation for the present work , where we examine all of the atlas susy related search results released before mid - september 2012 ; this corresponds to 22 analyses with @xmath05 fb@xmath5 at 7 tev and @xmath06 fb@xmath5 at 8 tev .",
    "the set of pmssm models we consider were previously generated  @xcite by imposing the following set of minimal assumptions on the r - parity conserving mssm : ( @xmath6 ) cp conservation , ( @xmath7 ) minimal flavor violation at the electroweak scale , ( @xmath8 ) degeneracy of the first and second generations of sfermion masses , ( @xmath9 ) the first two generations have negligible yukawa couplings and a - terms .",
    "in addition it is assumed that the lsp is the neutralino .",
    "we perform a random scan employing flat priors over the following parameter ranges : 100 gev @xmath10 4 tev , 400 gev @xmath11 4 tev , 200 gev @xmath12 4 tev , 50 gev @xmath13 4 tev , 100 gev @xmath14 4 tev , 400 gev @xmath15 4 tev , @xmath16 4 tev , 100 gev @xmath17 4 tev , and 1 @xmath18 60 .",
    "the limits of the scan ranges were chosen to obtain models that would test the search capabilities of the lhc at 7 , 8 , and 14 tev .",
    "we generated 3 million points and subjected them to the global data set , including , ( @xmath6 ) theoretical considerations of no tachyons or color / charge breaking minima as well as stable vacua , ( @xmath7 ) precision electroweak data ( @xmath19-parameter , invisible width of the @xmath20 and the @xmath21 boson mass ) , ( @xmath8 ) heavy flavor physics ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 ) , ( @xmath9 ) collider searches ( lep and tevatron direct higgs and susy searches , and lhc stable particle searches ) , and ( @xmath25 ) astroparticle physics constraints ( dark matter direct detection and the wmap relic density , which we employ only as an upper bound ) .",
    "we note that because of the relic density constraint in ( @xmath25 ) , many of our models have nearly pure wino or higgsino lsps .",
    "roughly 225k models survived these constraints and form our core pmssm model sample  @xcite . of these , approximately 45k models contain a lightest higgs boson mass in the range @xmath26 gev and form what we will refer to as our  higgs subset \"  @xcite .",
    "for further details , please see  @xcite .    in what follows",
    ", we will find that even with more energy and more searches at the lhc , the pmssm retains the favorable properties listed above . specifically",
    ", we will see that light ( @xmath27 gev ) 1st/2nd generation squarks and gluinos are consistent with the data , light ( @xmath28 gev ) stops / sbottoms can be present , and most of our low fine - tuning models remain viable .",
    "in addition we will see that increased luminosity at 8 tev results in only marginal improvements in the reach of the standard `` vanilla '' searches .",
    "we will examine the causes and consequences of these results .",
    "in particular , we will see that light higgsinos can be kinematically accessible at the ilc , and that the next generation of dark matter direct detection experiments have sensitivity to the low fine - tuning parameter region . in the next section",
    "we describe the recent lhc susy analyses that we incorporate , as well as the necessary modifications we implemented in the standard fast detection simulation pgs  @xcite . in section 3",
    "we present our results and their implications before concluding .",
    "in this section we describe the lhc search channels employed in our study and the corresponding implications of our fast detector simulations . as in previous work  @xcite , we generally use the published limits on the numbers of events in each experimental search region , or compute the limits from the published numbers of expected background and measured events using the @xmath29 method  @xcite .",
    "we begin by presenting the lhc analyses considered for this study , where we closely follow the atlas search strategies .",
    "generally , we have included every atlas susy search publically available as of september 2012 that is expected to significantly constrain the neutralino lsp pmssm model set described above .",
    "an exception is the searches involving final - state taus , due to the current limitations of the fast detector simulator pgs  @xcite which we employed . in order to apply the atlas analyses ,",
    "we have made numerous modifications to the pgs code , aiming to mimic the experimental environment as closely as possible .",
    "details on our general strategy , and some of these changes , may be found in  @xcite . here",
    ", we describe the additional modifications that were necessary to reproduce the atlas searches for this work .",
    "first , we examine the atlas @xmath05 fb@xmath5 7 tev jets plus met  @xcite , multi - jets  @xcite , and one lepton  @xcite searches .",
    "these were considered previously  @xcite , but remain relevant even after the 8 tev data , as will be seen below .",
    "we will refer to these searches as the `` vanilla '' 7 tev susy analyses , as opposed to the more specialized search channels , with signal regions involving third generation quarks or additional leptons .",
    "now that first and second generation squarks have been excluded at low mass in most standard scenarios , there has been much recent interest in searching explicitly for light third generation squarks .",
    "such squarks would , of course , be particularly appealing for a supersymmetric resolution of the hierarchy problem .",
    "several lhc analyses have sought evidence of direct stop or sbottom production by considering final states with @xmath30-quarks , both with and without leptons , and we have implemented many of them in this work . the various analyses target different squark mass ranges .",
    "as our scan ranges for the third generation squark mass parameters start at 200 gev , we have not considered searches that are directed towards stops or sbottoms lighter than the top quark mass . examining one such search  @xcite , we have verified that it is very unlikely that a pmssm model with a third generation squark above the top quark mass would be excluded , yet missed by more conventional searches for heavier third generation squarks . with this in mind , we have implemented all relevant atlas searches for third generation squarks heavier than the top quark  @xcite .    -tagging efficiency as a function of @xmath31 for the _ mv1 _ algorithm .",
    "the points show atlas data obtained using a @xmath32 sample at an operating point where the algorithm s overall efficiency was 60% .",
    "the curve is our fit to the atlas data .",
    "we use the fit function on true @xmath30-jets to implement @xmath30-tagging for signal regions using this algorithm and operating point .",
    "similarly good fits are obtained for other algorithms and operating points . ]",
    "the third generation searches use a variety of @xmath30-tagging algorithms at different efficiency points , reflecting both the rapid evolution of @xmath30-tagging methods and the higher @xmath30-tagging efficiencies required by recent searches involving multiple @xmath30-quarks .",
    "we have removed the original pgs @xmath30-tagging efficiency functions , which are based on the cdf run ii detector , and instead employ the built - in pgs `` truth '' jet type function for each jet , which outputs the type of the highest energy parton within 20 degrees of a jet .",
    "when testing whether an event passes the cuts for a given signal region , we take the true type of each jet in the event and apply an appropriate @xmath30-tagging efficiency function or light quark / gluon rejection factor .",
    "the efficiency functions and rejection factors vary for different signal regions and on the @xmath30-tagging algorithm chosen by atlas ; we estimate these from fits to atlas data  @xcite . as an example",
    ", figure  [ fig : btag ] shows the efficiency function we applied to true @xmath30-jets in order to reproduce the _ mv1 _ algorithm at an operating point that gave 60% efficiency on a @xmath32 sample . by fitting the atlas data with a logarithmic function for each @xmath30-tagging algorithm at each operating efficiency used , we are able to match the experimental @xmath30-tagging procedure well .",
    "there are also lhc searches using 7 tev data with signal regions involving multiple leptons .",
    "these are directed at both colored sparticle production with subsequent decays through electroweak gauginos , as well as direct slepton / gaugino production . in principle , both of these channels are possible in the pmssm , where the sparticle spectrum has no _ a priori _ structure .",
    "again , we do not include searches involving taus because pgs does not currently realistically reproduce tau efficiencies and fake rates at the lhc .",
    "however , all current atlas analyses involving electrons and muons are implemented  @xcite .",
    "in addition , searches have already been reported using the 8 tev lhc data from 2012 .",
    "in particular , atlas has performed analyses for final states with jets plus met  @xcite , many jets  @xcite , one lepton with jets plus met  @xcite , and same - sign dileptons with jets plus met  @xcite , using @xmath06 fb@xmath5 of 8 tev data .",
    "many of the signal regions in these analyses are quite similar to those of the corresponding 7 tev searches , though some cuts are slightly tightened . as we will see in section  [ results ] , these small changes for the 8 tev signal regions have the effect of reducing sensitivity to some models relative to the older 7 tev searches . as in  @xcite",
    ", we also extrapolate the 8 tev analyses to 25 fb@xmath5 of integrated luminosity , asking how many models would be excluded if the searches were repeated with the same cuts but more data . for this extrapolation",
    ", we scale the background and corresponding error in each signal region and calculate the signal event limit using the cl@xmath33 method  @xcite , assuming that the observed number of events at 25 fb@xmath5 matches the expected background . because of downward fluctuations in the observed numbers of events in many 8 tev signal regions at 6 fb@xmath5",
    ", the estimated sensitivity with 25 fb@xmath5 can be comparable to , or even worse than , that obtained at 6 fb@xmath5 .",
    "in fact , we will find that the fraction of models in our set that would be expected to be excluded with 25 fb@xmath5 of data at 8 tev is not significantly higher than the fraction of models that is already excluded .",
    "in addition to the standard searches using jets , leptons , and missing energy , searches for more exotic detector signals , particularly those associated with long - lived charged particles , provide important limits on supersymmetric models . for models with neutralino lsps ,",
    "the lightest chargino is frequently metastable when the lsp is a nearly pure wino eigenstate . in this case",
    "the next - to - lsp ( nlsp ) is usually a wino - like chargino , and the mass splitting between the two is typically only @xmath0160 mev , leading to detector - scale decay lengths .",
    "the prevalence of nearly pure wino lsps in our model set  @xcite results in a significant fraction ( @xmath04% ) of models in which the lightest chargino has an unboosted decay length over 7 m ( _ e.g. _ , long enough to traverse the cms muon spectrometer ) , and even more models ( @xmath025% ) in which the lightest chargino decays in the tracker , calorimeter , or muon chamber . in a few cases ,",
    "sparticles other than the @xmath34 are metastable as a result of small mass splittings with the lsp .",
    "however , these cases are quite rare since they rely on accidental degeneracies that are uncommon due to the random nature of our parameter scan . as a result , only a tiny fraction ( 0.14% ) of our models have charged sparticles that are not charginos and have unboosted decay lengths beyond 7 m .",
    "our analysis is thus tailored to chargino nlsps , although it is applicable to any uncolored metastable sparticle . models with metastable colored sparticles require modifications to hadronization and decay routines within pythia and will be considered in our study of the collider signatures of the pmssm with a gravitino lsp  @xcite .",
    "metastable charginos produce several different signatures depending on the location of their decay vertex .",
    "charginos decaying inside the tracker produce an extremely soft pion , resulting in a disappearing track which is the focus of a dedicated atlas search  @xcite .",
    "charginos decaying outside of the tracker will be detected by searches for highly ionizing particles , using either the inner detector alone ( if the chargino decays before leaving the muon spectrometer ) or both the inner detector and muon chamber .",
    "both atlas and cms search for highly ionizing particles ; we choose to apply the cms search  @xcite to our model set as the variety of signal channels and efficiencies presented are helpful for validation of our simulation .",
    "metastable charginos require careful treatment in several stages of our analysis . as described in  @xcite , we employ analytic formulae to calculate chargino decays for models in which the lightest chargino and lsp masses are split by less than 1 gev .",
    "we have also found it necessary to modify the pgs package . within pgs ,",
    "we have altered , or added , functions reconstructing a metastable charged particles s momentum , velocity , and calorimeter response , and have modified the output to include the location of any decay vertex , the presence or absence of a muon spectrometer track , the tracker and calorimeter isolation sums , and the particle velocity . our analysis routine uses the particle velocity to compute the ionization energy loss in the tracker before applying cuts specific to the individual search .",
    "these modifications are described in detail below .",
    "the most sensitive searches for very long - lived charginos rely heavily on the muon system .",
    "we therefore introduce several modifications to the standard pgs treatment of the muon spectrometer response to a heavy metastable charged particle .",
    "first , we have implemented a special momentum resolution function for particles reconstructed in the muon spectrometer with @xmath35 @xmath36 100 gev .",
    "this is necessary because the standard spectrometer momentum resolution function in pgs is simulated by the momentum resolution of the inner tracker , which is outperformed by the muon spectrometer at high @xmath35 .",
    "our muon spectrometer momentum resolution function is a copy of that used to simulate the inner detector momentum resolution , but employs input parameters mimicking the atlas muon spectrometer .",
    "( the difference in resolution between the atlas and cms muon systems is not important for our purposes . )",
    "the main motivation for including a dedicated muon resolution function is to decrease the extraneous met resulting from mismeasurement of long - lived sparticles that frequently have a very high @xmath35 .",
    "second , we have strengthened the requirements for track reconstruction within the muon spectrometer ( which was previously only a pseudorapidity cut ) .",
    "a metastable charged particle can fail reconstruction in the muon spectrometer by decaying before it produces enough hits for reconstruction . since the requirements for reconstruction depend on the detailed geometry of the muon spectrometer",
    ", we conservatively require muon candidates to decay outside of the muon spectrometer ( @xmath37 m in the rapidity region of interest ) .",
    "additionally , slow - moving particles may produce delayed hits in the muon spectrometer that are not associated with the primary vertex .",
    "we therefore subject the track reconstruction to the velocity - dependent efficiency given in  @xcite : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the fraction of stable charged particles with a given velocity and a rapidity within the muon spectrometer acceptance that are reconstructed by the muon system . finally , timing measurements within the muon spectrometer provide a measurement of @xmath40 by using time - of - flight .",
    "we simulate this measurement by smearing the truth - level value of @xmath40 with a gaussian with a width of 0.06 , as given by  @xcite .",
    "although muons and muon - like particles typically deposit only a few gev of energy in the calorimeters , very slow - moving particles ( @xmath41 ) can deposit a significantly larger amount of energy . since",
    "few metastable charginos are produced with such a low velocity , however , we simply neglect the calorimeters and use the muon track to correct the missing energy measurement . while this approach slightly overestimates the amount of missing energy in events with slow - moving metastable particles which fail to produce a muon track , the effect on our results is insignificant .",
    "the cms search for heavy stable charged particles uses a modified version of the smirnov - cramer - von mises discriminant , denoted by @xmath42 , to estimate the compatibility of the observed charge deposition for a given track and that expected for a particle near the minimum of ionization .",
    "the discriminant is defined by the following formula : @xmath43},\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the number of hits and @xmath45 is the sorted probability for the energy deposited by a minimum - ionizing particle to be less than or equal to the energy deposited in the @xmath46 hit .",
    "our analysis code uses our modified pgs output to calculate @xmath42 in the following manner .",
    "first , the _ most probable _ ionization is calculated using an experimental parametrization : @xmath47 with @xmath48 and @xmath49  @xcite .",
    "this expression agrees closely with the bethe - bloch formula in the range @xmath50 ; for values of @xmath51 below ( above ) this range , the precise details can be neglected because the particle is clearly highly ionizing ( minimum ionizing ) .",
    "second , we assume that the particle has 16 hits in the cms tracker  @xcite , and choose an energy deposition @xmath52 for each hit from a gaussian of width @xmath53 centered at @xmath54 .",
    "( the width is determined by a gaussian fit to the ionization energy distribution for minimum bias events in figure 4 of  @xcite . )",
    "we model the saturation of the cms pixel detector with a threshold of @xmath55 by assigning the threshold value to any hit above threshold .",
    "third , for each hit we calculate the probability that a minimum - ionizing particle would deposit a smaller or equivalent amount of energy by integrating the probability density function ( pdf ) for its ionization energy deposition from zero to @xmath52 .",
    "tev , most of these hits come from pions near the minimum of ionization .",
    "as a cross - check , the pdf for minimum ionizing particles determined in a test run  @xcite is similar to the one we use .",
    "we also expect that the pdfs for the silicon strip tracker and pixel detector are equivalent within our desired accuracy . ] finally , we sort the individual probabilities and sum them according to the expression given above .    the cms search for heavy stable charged particles ( hscps )  @xcite requires an inner detector track with 11 hits in the silicon tracker .",
    "we approximate this high number of required hits by simply requiring a hscp candidate to decay outside of the silicon tracker , r @xmath56 1.1 m  @xcite .",
    "we simulate the preselection process by imposing cuts on met , candidate pseudorapidity , and calorimeter and tracker isolation sums . for the tracker+time - of - flight analysis",
    ", we additionally require the presence of a track in the muon spectrometer .",
    "the final selection is divided into search regions , defined by cuts on the values of @xmath35 , @xmath42 , the reconstructed mass , and ( for the tracker+time - of - flight analysis ) @xmath51 .",
    "we simulate the reconstructed mass cut by applying a given search region only to candidates with a truth - level mass at least 1 standard deviation above the cut value .",
    "this implies that an insignificant fraction of signal events will be removed by the mass cut .",
    "we note that all of our stable particles pass the mass cut for at least one search region , and even low - mass search regions have very high sensitivity .",
    "we validated this analysis by comparing our simulation with two benchmarks : pair - produced stable staus with masses of 100 gev and 308 gev .",
    "the results of our validation are shown in tables  [ cms_tkonly ] and  [ cms_tktof ] .",
    "comparing our results with those of cms shows that we reproduce the production cross section for both benchmarks .",
    "the acceptance of the tracker+time - of - flight analysis is also reproduced quite nicely , while our acceptance for the tracker - only analysis ( particularly for the 100 gev stau ) is significantly higher than that predicted by cms .",
    "since the tracker - only analysis is only relevant for charginos decaying in the calorimeter or muon spectrometer , the tracker+time - of - flight analysis is considerably more important for our model set .",
    "we note that the discrepancy seen for the light stau model is most likely because the light staus tend to have @xmath57 , making them difficult to distinguish from minimum - ionizing particles and introducing a strong sensitivity to the details of ionization energy deposition .",
    "fortunately , models with very light stable charginos are excluded by the lhc , the tevatron and lep ( and therefore are excluded during model generation ) .",
    "the accuracy of our treatment is significantly better where it is most relevant , namely for heavier charginos with masses near the the exclusion boundary .",
    "the atlas disappearing track search  @xcite looks for charginos which are reconstructed in the silicon tracker ( sct ) , but not in the outer transition radiation tracker ( trt ) .",
    "we therefore require candidates to decay between the outer edge of the sct ( 520 mm ) and the inner edge of the outer trt ( 863 mm ) . the high number of hits required in the sct and low number required in the outer trt support these sharp cutoffs .",
    "we approximate the track isolation requirement ( no tracks with @xmath58 gev within @xmath59 ) by using @xmath60 ; a negligible difference between the two requirements was observed during comparison with benchmarks .",
    "we then require candidates to be the highest @xmath35 isolated track in the event and impose cuts on the standard physics objects ( leptons , jets , and met ) .",
    "we validated our analysis with the atlas benchmarks ( 100 and 200 gev charginos with 1 ns lifetimes ) ; the results are presented in table  [ atlas_distrk ] .",
    "our pair - production cross sections and signal efficiencies for both models are in agreement with the atlas values , indicating that our geometric acceptance cuts and isolation requirements accurately reproduce the atlas analysis .",
    ".validation of our simulation of the cms tracker - only hscp search , comparing our results for the production cross section and acceptance with that of cms . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     at @xmath61 gev",
    ", we begin to see small samples of models where both sleptons and the next heaviest set of electroweak gauginos become kinematically accessible , although the numbers are still quite small . once @xmath62 tev is reached , small samples of models with kinematically accessible light stops and sbottoms are present .",
    "it is clear , however , that a sizable fraction of the sparticle spectrum will only become accessible at collision energies above @xmath02 tev .",
    "our results also have implications for dark matter searches .",
    "for example , figure  [ fig : direct ] shows the direct detection spin - independent cross section ( scaled by the ratio of the relic density to the total dark matter density ) as a function of the lsp mass , and displays the recent xenon-100 bound  @xcite as well as the expected reach of xenon-1 t  @xcite for reference . the upper left ( black )",
    "scatter plot shows the results for our original pmssm neutralino model set as generated , while the upper right panel shows the corresponding subset of models surviving all the lhc search constraints except for the higgs mass requirement .",
    "the lower left ( brown ) panel includes this constraint .",
    "we see from this figure that , apart from the overall density of points , the lhc searches do not have much influence on the overall nature of the distribution of cross section predictions .",
    "the higgs mass requirement , though thinning the point density significantly , is also seen to have little impact on these expectations .",
    "thus we conclude that pmssm searches at the lhc have very little impact on the possible range of spin - independent relic density - scaled cross sections , and that indeed these searches are complementary .",
    "the lower right panel shows the predicted relic density - scaled cross sections for the remaining low fine - tuning models discussed above .",
    "here we see that these models should mostly be accessible to the xenon-1 t experiment .",
    "with the remarkable performance of the lhc , many searches for supersymmetry have been performed this year with both 7 tev and 8 tev data .",
    "it is important to ensure that as analyses are designed to search for new physics , experimental collaborations strive to obtain maximal coverage of the vast parameter space of susy .",
    "the most simple searches undoubtedly leave corners of this space unexplored , necessitating the identification of such regions and the development of new search strategies to survey them . here , we have continued our previous work in this area by studying the capabilities of the latest lhc searches to constrain a large set of pmssm models . compared to previous searches , we find that significantly improved coverage of the pmssm is afforded by the additional analyses . while our original model set did not require a higgs mass near 126 gev , our results are found to be generally independent of this additional constraint .",
    "the first searches for susy with 8 tev data employ signal regions that are very similar to those in their 7 tev counterparts . with slightly tighter cuts and several downward fluctuations in the numbers of observed versus expected events , these searches successfully exclude models that had remained viable after the corresponding 7 tev analyses . an increase in integrated luminosity at 8 tev ,",
    "however , will not cause the coverage of these searches to improve much further , unless either downward fluctuations of events continue to occur or reductions in the background uncertainties can be achieved .",
    "we also caution that a small fraction of models that are allowed by the 8 tev searches had produced enough signal events to be excluded by the analogous 7 tev searches .",
    "this result is symptomatic of the unavoidable trade - off between obtaining search sensitivity in new areas of parameter space and retaining sensitivity in previously probed regions .",
    "in addition , directed searches for stops / sbottoms , sleptons , and electroweak gauginos involve less conventional signatures of supersymmetry , particularly @xmath30-jets and leptons in the final state . while these searches rule out fewer pmssm models overall than the more general susy searches , they enjoy success in excluding some spectra that are missed by the latter .",
    "often , such models have heavier gluinos and 1st/2nd generation squarks , making it difficult for conventional searches to see them . because most of our gauginos are wino and higgsino multiplets with very small mass splittings , the heavy flavor signal regions have comparatively better sensitivity to our pmssm models than the direct gaugino searches .",
    "the last class of searches that we have included in this work involves signatures without missing energy .",
    "given the significant population of models with stable charginos within our model set , it is not surprising that searches for heavy stable charged particles and disappearing tracks exclude significant fractions of the models .",
    "updates to the @xmath63 and @xmath64 analyses have improved the lhc coverage of our model set as well .",
    "notably , since the signal regions for these non - met searches involve criteria that are very different from those of other searches , the coverage gained from these analyses is nearly orthogonal to that obtained from the met - based searches .",
    "after including all of these analyses , we find that many pmssm spectra with light sparticles survive .",
    "while supersymmetry continues to be limited by the lack of collider signatures thus far , the state of the full mssm is far better than suggested by limits on simplified models or more constrained scenarios such as msugra . in particular",
    ", we find surviving models containing 1st/2nd generation squarks , gluinos , and 3rd generation squarks with masses below 600 , 700 , and 400 gev , respectively",
    ". models with light colored sparticles that are not excluded by lhc searches generally have compressed spectra .",
    "we also observe viable models with fine - tuning near 1% , indicating that the mssm still has significant potential to provide a natural solution to the hierarchy problem .",
    "finally , we have considered the potential of experiments outside the lhc to observe supersymmetry .",
    "a linear collider would be able to produce many of the light gaugino states in our viable models .",
    "we emphasize that if the mssm is indeed natural , light higgsinos will be copiously produced at a future @xmath65 collider .",
    "astrophysical experiments provide a complementary method of searching for supersymmetry by seeking signatures of dark matter , which is composed of neutralinos in the models considered here . by searching for direct interactions of the lsp with matter",
    ", an upgraded xenon experiment would probe a significant fraction of our pmssm model set .",
    "both of these avenues of exploration are orthogonal to the lhc supersymmetry searches , and would be particularly effective in probing natural susy .",
    "having surveyed the vast landscape of minimal supersymmetry with the pmssm , we declare it to be alive and well .",
    "we look forward to upcoming collider and astrophysical results , in the hope of finally revealing the hitherto elusive face of susy .",
