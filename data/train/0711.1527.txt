    "the non - equilibrium collective relaxation of pure systems quenched at or below their critical points has been recently the subject of a renewed interest in connection with the fact that two - time quantities  such as response and correlation functions  display a scaling behavior similar to the one observed in glassy systems  @xcite .",
    "in addition , at the critical point , this scaling behavior is characterized by a certain degree of _ universality _",
    "@xcite which renders it largely independent of the microscopic details of the systems and allows its investigation via suitable minimal models , either on the lattice or in the continuum .",
    "the former can be easily studied via monte carlo simulations ( or , in a limited number of cases , exact solutions are available ) , whereas powerful field - theoretical methods have been developed for the latter .    in what follows we",
    "will be concerned with the behavior of the two - time response function .",
    "consider a lattice model characterized by degrees of freedom @xmath0 with @xmath1 , interacting via an hamiltonian @xmath2 = \\h_0[\\{\\sigma_\\x\\ } ] - \\sum_\\x \\sigma_\\x h_\\x(t)$ ] , where @xmath3 is a time - dependent external field . in the case of the ising model @xmath4 , @xmath5 = - j \\sum_{\\langle\\x\\y \\rangle } \\sigma_\\x\\sigma_\\y$ ] ( @xmath6 ) , the sum being over pairs @xmath7 of nearest neighboring sites .",
    "the stochastic dynamics of the model , due to the coupling to a thermal bath of temperature @xmath8 , can be implemented according to different rules and yields a time dependence of the value of the local degree of freedom @xmath9 .",
    "the linear two - time response function is defined as r_r(t , s ) = .|_h=0 [ resp ] where @xmath10 , @xmath11 indicates the average over the possible realizations of the stochastic dynamics , and invariance under space translations has been assumed .",
    "causality implies that @xmath12 vanishes for @xmath13 and therefore we shall assume @xmath14 in what follows .",
    "in addition , we shall primarily consider the local response function ( also referred to as _ auto_response function ) r(t , s ) r_r=0(t , s ) .",
    "[ autoresp ] if the system is in thermal equilibrium with the bath , the dynamics is invariant under time translations and therefore @xmath12 actually depends only on @xmath15 , i.e. , @xmath16 .",
    "time - translational invariance is naturally broken if , at time @xmath17 , the temperature of the bath is suddenly changed from an initial value @xmath18  which we shall assume to be high enough to yield a disordered state in the system  to a final value @xmath19 . after the quench , the system undergoes a non - equilibrium relaxation towards the new equilibrium state at the temperature @xmath20 , which is attained after a time @xmath21 . in some circumstances , however , @xmath22 and the dynamics retains its non - equilibrium character forever .",
    "interestingly enough , a robust scaling behavior emerge in this regime as it is revealed by two - time quantities such as the linear response function  ( [ resp ] ) . in the paradigmatic case of ferromagnetic systems , @xmath23",
    " in the thermodynamic limit  if the quench occurs at @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the critical temperature of the system .",
    "in such a case , the behavior of @xmath12 depends on the relation between @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "we restrict our analysis to the case @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is a microscopic time scale set by the dynamics and such that for @xmath30 non - universal corrections to scaling appear . in the sector @xmath31 , referred to as _ short - time separation regime _ ( stsr ) , time - translational invariance and time - reversal symmetry",

    "these being the behaviors in two different regimes , it remains to be clarified : ( a ) how the crossover between the forms  ( [ 1 ] ) and  ( [ genscalag ] ) actually occurs in @xmath36 and ( b ) how @xmath37 behaves .    for quenches at the critical temperature",
