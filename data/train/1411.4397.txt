    "the impossibility to clone quantum states is regarded as one of the most fundamental restriction which nature provides us @xcite . the  no cloning theorem \" states that there exists no quantum mechanical process that can take two different non - orthogonal quantum states @xmath0 , @xmath1 into states @xmath2 , @xmath3 respectively .",
    "even though we can not copy an unknown quantum state perfectly but quantum mechanics never rules out the possibility of cloning it approximately @xcite .",
    "it also allows probabilistic cloning as one can always clone an arbitrary quantum state perfectly with some non - zero probability of succsess @xcite .    in the year 1996 , buzek et al .",
    "introduced the concept of approximate cloning with certain fidelity . in this process ,",
    "the state independent quantum copying machine was introduced by keeping the fidelity of cloning independent of the input state parameters .",
    "this machine is popularly known as universal quantum cloning machine ( uqcm ) @xcite which was later proven to be optimal @xcite . apart from this state independent quantum cloning machine ( qcm )",
    ", there are also state dependent qcms for which the quality of copies depend on the input state @xcite .",
    "quantum entanglement @xcite which lies at the heart of quantum information theory is one of the key factor for better achievement of fidelity of qcms @xcite .",
    "not only that , it also plays a significant role in computational and communicational processes like quantum key distribution @xcite , secret sharing @xcite , teleportation @xcite , superdense coding @xcite , entanglement swapping @xcite , remote entanglement distribution @xcite and in many more tasks @xcite .",
    "atleast in the context of quantum information processing , purer the entanglement , more valuable is the given two qubit state .",
    "therefore , extraction of pure quantum entanglement from a partially entangled state is considered to be an important task .",
    "consequently , there have been a lot of work on purification procedures by many researchers over the last few years showing how one can compress the amount of quantum entanglement locally @xcite .",
    "the possibility of compression of quantum correlations naturally raises the question if the opposite i.e. decompression of correlations is realizable or not ? many researchers have answered this query using the process known as  broadcasting of inseparability \" @xcite .",
    "this question becomes important when there is an exigency in increasing the number of available entangled pairs rather than the purity of it . in simple sense",
    ", broadcasting here refers to local or nonlocal copying of quantum correlations @xcite .",
    "in general , the term broadcasting can be used in different contexts .",
    "classical theory permits broadcasting of information , however that is not the case for all states in quantum theory . cloning and broadcasting principles demarcate the boundary between classical and quantum worlds . in this context , barnum _",
    "et al _ were the first to show that non - commuting mixed states do not meet the criteria of broadcasting @xcite .",
    "it is impossible to have a process which will perfectly copy ( clone and broadcast ) an arbitrary quanutm state @xcite . by referring to perfect broadcasting of correlations we mean that the correlations in a two qubit state @xmath4 are locally broadcastable if there exist two operations , @xmath5 : @xmath6 and @xmath7 : @xmath8 such that @xmath9 = @xmath10 = @xmath11",
    "here , @xmath11 is the quantum mutual information , @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "quite recently , many authors showed that correlations in a single bipartite state can be locally or unilocally broadcast if and only if the states are classical ( i.e. having classical correlations ) or classical - quantum respectively @xcite .    in the previous cases ,",
    "we generally discussed about broadcasting of a general quantum state or perfect broadcasting of correlations .",
    "but when we refer broadcasting of an entangled state , we generally talk about creating more pairs of lesser entangled states from a given entangled state where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are less than @xmath11 .",
    "this is done via the application of local cloning operation on each qubit of the given entangled state , or sometimes by applying global cloning operations on the total input entangled state itself @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that only uqcms having fidelity over @xmath14 can broadcast entanglement and further that entanglement in the input state is optimally broadcast only if the quantum cloners used for local copying are optimal .",
    "however , the fact that if local cloners are used then broadcasting of entanglement into more than two entangled pairs is impossible .",
    "_ addressed the question of broadcasting of entanglement by using local universal optimal asymmetric pauli cloning machines .",
    "they presented that if one employs symmetric cloners instead of asymmetric ones , then only optimal broadcasting of inseparability is achievable @xcite .",
    "in other works , authors investigated the problem of secretly broadcasting of three - qubit entangled state between two distant partners with universal quantum cloning machine and then the result is generalized to generate secret entanglement among three parties @xcite .",
    "various other works on broadcasting of entanglement depending on the types of qcms were also done in the later period @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we mainly investigate the problem of broadcasting of quantum correlations ( qcs ) .",
    "traditionally , by qcs we refer to entanglement .",
    "first part of our study is about broadcasting of quantum entanglement for general two qubit mixed states .",
    "for the first time in the existing research on broadcasting , we provide the broadcasting range for general two qubit state in terms of bloch vectors . to do this we apply the buzek - hillery ( b - h ) qcm , both locally and non - locally .",
    "we separately provide broadcasting ranges for werner - like and bell - diagonal states as illustration . in the second part of our work , while exploring the possibility of broadcasting of quantum correlations that go beyond entanglement ( qcsbe ) , remarkably we find that it is impossible to broadcast optimally such correlations with the help of any local or nonlocal cloners .",
    "we analytically prove this by first taking the b - h state dependent and independent cloners and then by logically extending our result for the other cloners as well .",
    "this is indeed one such result which highlights how fundamentally two approaches , qcsbe and entanglement , are different .",
    "however , we can broadcast qcsbe if we relax the optimality conditions .    in section",
    "ii , we first introduce the quantum cloning machines , more specifically the state independent and dependent versions of b - h cloners , which we will later use for our local as well as nonlocal cloning processes . in section iii , we define broadcasting of entanglement via local cloning operations as well as non - local cloning operation and then obtain the generalized optimal broadcasting range for any two qubit state in terms of bloch vectors . in each of the two above cases , we exemplify our results for two types of mixed states : namely the werner - like and the bell - diagonal states . in section iv",
    ", we give the definition for broadcasting of qcsbe and explicitly discuss the possibilities and impossibilities of such broadcasting .",
    "lastly , in section v , we conclude with a small conjecture by which broadcasting of correlations beyond entanglement might be possible .",
    "quantum cloning transformations can be viewed as a completely positive ( cp ) trace preserving map between two quantum systems , supported by an ancilla @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we briefly describe the buzek - hillery ( b - h ) qcm which we will later use for analysing the possibility and impossibility of broadcasting of entanglement as well as correlations beyond entanglement respectively .",

    "this state is to be copied on a blank state @xmath19 .",
    "the copier is initially prepared in state @xmath20 which subsequently get transformed into another set of state vectors @xmath21 and @xmath22 as a result of application of the cloner .",

    "again in 2003 , ghiu _ et al _ showed that entanglement is optimally broadcast and maximal fidelities of the two final entangled states are obtained only when symmetric cloning machines are applied @xcite .",
    "so by combining the above two results by sazim _",
    "et al _ and ghiu _ et al _ , we can logically infer that _ even asymmetric pauli cloning machines will be unable to broadcast qcsbe optimally since for those also the local outputs will always possess non - vanishing gd _ @xcite .",
    "this enables us to comprehensively conclude that optimal broadcasting of qcsbe for any two qubit state via cloning operations is impossible .      in this subsection",
    ", we will discuss the possibilities and impossibilities of broadcasting qcsbe under non - unital channel ( @xmath262 ) . here",
    "many situations can occur depending on the free will of the parties : a ) pre - possesing the state with unital channel & post - processing with non - unital channel , b ) pre - processing with non - unital channel & post - processing with unital channel , and c ) pre- & post - procesing with nonunital channel .",
    "all these situations are equivalent in the sense that qcsbe can increase under @xmath262 .",
    "it is also evident that we can have task oriented broadcasting of qcsbe and can increase the qcsbe of the broadcasted states if needed . _ and conceptually the notion of optimal broadcasting of qcsbe is not clear as we can have quantum correlated broadcast states although we start with totally classical correlated states_.",
    "in literature , generalized approaches exist for purification or compression of entanglement procedures but no such generalization exists for broadcasting ( decompression ) of entanglement via cloning operations @xcite .",
    "such a study can aid in discovering operational meaning of quantifying the amount of entanglement @xcite . in a nutshell , in this work we present a holistic picture of broadcasting of quantum entanglement via cloning from any input two qubit state .",
    "we explicitly provide a set of ranges in terms of input state parameters for a most general representation of two qubit states for which broadcasting of entanglement will be possible .",
    "we exemplify our generalized results by examining them for two class of states : ( a ) werner - like and ( b ) bell - diagonal .",
    "we perform this study with both type of cloning techniques , local and nonlocal , to examine how the range of broadcasting increases under nonlocal cloning operations .",
    "thereafter , we focus on the question whether broadcasting of qcsbe via cloning operations is possible or not .",
    "contrary to the broadcasting of entanglement , we find that it is impossible to broadcast such qcsbe optimally via cloning operations , whether local or nonlocal , from a given quantum mechanically correlated pair to two lesser correlated pairs .",
    "but we can have task oriented broadcasting for qcsbe .",
    "we also explicitly reason out why the local outputs from cloner ( state dependent or state independent ) will never possess vanishing qcsbe which is imperative to broadcast qcsbe .",
    "however , we can intuitively conjecture that if one tries to broadcast qcsbe to more than two pairs , say @xmath302 pairs , from an initial two qubit state then for some @xmath303 pairs there is possibility of success in broadcasting such correlations optimally .",
    "this is because the nonlocal outputs become unentangled when @xmath270 and @xmath304 pairs are generated by the optimal local and nonlocal cloners respectively , which hints that the qcsbe in the output states decreases as more pairs are produced by the cloner @xcite .",
    "our findings brings out a fundamental difference between the correlation defined from the perspective of entanglement and the correlation measure which claims to go beyond entanglement .",

    "<S> in this work , we extensively study the problem of broadcasting of quantum correlations ( qcs ) . </S>",
    "<S> this includes broadcasting of quantum entanglement as well as correlations that go beyond the notion of entanglement ( qcsbe ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is quite well known from the  no - broadcasting theorem \" that perfect broadcasting of qcs is not possible . </S>",
    "<S> however it does not rule out the possibility of partial broadcasting of qcs where we can get lesser correlated states from a given correlated state . in order to have a holistic view of broadcasting </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate this problem by starting with most general representation of two qubit mixed states in terms of the bloch vectors . as a cloning transformation </S>",
    "<S> we have used universal symmetric optimal buzek - hillery ( b - h ) cloner both locally and nonlocally . unlike entanglement </S>",
    "<S> , we find that it is impossible to broadcast qcsbe optimally . </S>",
    "<S> lastly , we generalize these results for any symmetric or asymmetric cloning machines as well . </S>",
    "<S> this result brings out a fundamental difference between the correlations defined from the perspective of entanglement and the correlations measure which claims to go beyond entanglement . </S>"
