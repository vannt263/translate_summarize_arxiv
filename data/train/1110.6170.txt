    "we study the algebro  geometrical structure of the black  scholes equation .    the computation of the symmetry group of a partial differential equation has proven itself to be a very useful tool in classical mathematical physics ( see _ e.g. @xcite ) , as well as in euclidean quantum mechanics ( see _ e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "it was therefore natural to try and use the same method in financial mathematics .",
    "_ _    after setting the general framework (  2 ) , and performing some preliminary reductions (  3 ) , we determine (  4 ) the isovectors for the black - scholes equation in a way broadly similar to the one used for the backward heat equation with potential term in the second of the two aforementioned joint papers with j .- c .",
    "our computation turns out to suggest black and scholes original solution method ( @xcite ) of their equation ; in particular , the quantities @xmath0 and @xmath1 appear naturally in this context . as corollaries ,",
