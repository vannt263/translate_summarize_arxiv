    "the strong degeneracy between the curvature of the universe and the dark energy equation of state causes difficulties for constraining the two parameters simultaneously .",
    "the curvature is commonly left out in a dark energy analysis , or conversely , a dark energy constant is assumed in a determination of the curvature .",
    "however , a simple flatness assumption may result in erroneously reconstructing the dark energy equation of state even if the true curvature is very small @xcite , and a cosmological constant assumption may arise confusions between a dynamical dark energy non - flat model and the flat @xmath7cdm model @xcite . in @xcite , when arguing the defects of a zero curvature assumption , a direct curvature determination by combining measurements of the hubble parameter @xmath1 and the comoving angular diameter distance @xmath8 was proposed : @xmath9 ^ 2-c^2}{[h_0d(z)]^2 }   \\label{eq : curv}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 denotes derivative with respect to redshift @xmath11 .",
    "this formula benefits from the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) measurements which can provide @xmath1 and @xmath2 simultaneously at the same redshift . here",
    "@xmath2 is the angular diameter distance , which is correlated to the comoving angular diameter distance by @xmath12 . since the derivation of @xmath1 and @xmath2 pairs from bao measurements are purely geometrical , eq.([eq : curv ] )",
    "can be evaluated without any assumption of dynamic evolution of universe , therefore breaks the degeneracy between curvature and dark energy equation of state .",
    "several works have already derived the @xmath1 and @xmath2 pairs from the data of wigglez dark energy survey at @xmath13 @xcite , and the third generation sloan digital sky survey ( sdss - iii ) at @xmath14 @xcite and @xmath15 @xcite . with the quasar - lyman @xmath3 forest in sdss - iii",
    ", the measurement of @xmath1 and @xmath2 has extended to high redshift such as @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "these data can afford us to directly determine the curvature parameter via eq.([eq : curv ] ) .",
    "the remaining issue is to estimate the @xmath16 reasonably .",
    "@xcite has applied a novel method to take the derivative of the luminosity distance @xmath17 with respect to the scale factor in their model - independent reconstruction of hubble parameter .",
    "they decomposed the observables into a suitable basis functions , then recombined the derivatives of the basis functions to yield the @xmath18 .",
    "the basis system was whereafter optimized by @xcite to be capable to describe cosmologies independently of their background physics and improve the quality of the estimation of @xmath18 .",
    "this method is independent to any cosmology model and can be employed by us to estimate the @xmath16 .    by combining the data and method described above",
    ", we can determine the curvature parameter in a model - independent manner .",
    "this approach is different from previous works employing smoothing procedures in redshift bins or reconstruction of both hubble parameter and comoving angular diameter distance ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the property of eq.([eq : curv ] ) has determined that the error on the measured curvature parameter decreases as the redshift increases , thus we can benefit from the bao lyman @xmath3 forest measurement which can provide @xmath1 and @xmath2 pair at high redshift .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : method ] , we review the essential parts of the model - independent method . the description of data and application of the method are shown in section [ sec : application ] .",
    "the discussions are presented in section [ sec : discussion ] and the conclusions are drawn in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we follow the idea in @xcite , and use the method proposed in @xcite and further developed by @xcite , to determine the curvature parameter in a model - independent manner .      in friedmann - robertson - walker metric",
    ", the comoving angular diameter distance is written as @xmath19 where the hubble parameter @xmath1 at late time is given by @xmath20^\\frac{1}{2 } \\label{eq : h(z)}\\ ] ] the parameters @xmath21 , @xmath0 and @xmath22 are the current density of matter , curvature and dark energy in unit of the critical density respectively .",
    "the function @xmath23 depends on the ratio @xmath24 between the pressure and the density of the dark energy . by combining eq.([eq : h(z ) ] ) and eq.([eq : f(z ) ] ) , the degeneracy between curvature and dark energy can be easily seen , as the non - zero curvature can be mimicked by the model with zero curvature and a dark energy component with @xmath25 , therefore results in difficulties in fitting eq.([eq : d(z ) ] ) to observables .",
    "in fact , by solving the integral part from eq.([eq : d(z ) ] ) and taking derivative with respect to redshift on both side of the integral , one can derive eq.([eq : curv ] ) .",
    "the dynamic assumption of the universe thus has no place in the determination of the curvature .",
    "the key issue here is to estimate @xmath16  the derivative of the comoving angular diameter distances with respect to the redshift in eq.([eq : curv ] ) .",
    "we suppose there is an underlying function @xmath8 describing the behaviors of the comoving angular diameter distances . the @xmath8 could be expanded into a series of suitable orthonormal functions @xmath26 , @xmath27 by fitting eq.([eq : decomp ] ) to the obsevables @xmath28 , the @xmath29 coefficients @xmath30 are determined .",
    "the number of the terms to be included in the expansion depends on the choice of the orthonormal basis and the quality of the data .",
    "the derivative of eq.([eq : decomp ] ) is then taken as the estimation of the derivative in eq.([eq : curv ] ) .",
    "the basis @xmath31 , in principle , could be arbitrary with ideal data , but it is not in practice .",
    "@xcite used an arbitrary orthonormal basis generated by gram - schmidt orthonormalization of @xmath32 to decompose the luminosity distances .",
    "they observed a systematic trend on the slope of the reconstructed @xmath1 at intermediate redshifts when compared with the predictions of a @xmath7cdm cosmology , although they were consistent within the error bars .",
    "it indicated that a randomly chosen system of orthonormal basis functions may not be well adapted to the behavior of the measured data .",
    "@xcite has proposed an optimal basis system derived from principal component analysis ( pca ) . under this optimal basis system ,",
    "the number of coefficients @xmath29 in eq.([eq : decomp ] ) reaches minimal and the possible bias introduced by the choice of the basis is removed @xcite .",
    "the derivation of the optimal basis starts with writing the comoving angular diameter distances and their redshifts in column vectors @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively .",
    "the data set @xmath33 is therefore considered as a single point in an @xmath35-dimensional space , where @xmath35 is the number of the data points .",
    "then we select a group of models that are believed to span the viable cosmologies , and calculate the comoving angular diameter distances @xmath8 for each model at the redshifts in @xmath34 to generate a set of vectors @xmath36 @xmath37 , where @xmath29 is the number of the models .",
    "these new vectors correspond to a cluster of points in the @xmath35-dimensional space and should meet the condition that the data set @xmath33 is tightly enclosed in the distribution of the cluster @xcite .",
    "this ensemble of models , referred as the _ training set _",
    ", samples the possible behaviors of the comoving angular diameter distances , and initializes the pca .",
    "once the training set models @xmath38 @xmath39 are defined , we build the so - called _ scatter matrix _ @xmath40 with @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath42 contains the differences between each training vector @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath43 is the reference model that defines the origin of the @xmath35-dimensional space .",
    "@xmath44 is actually the deviation of the training set from the reference model .",
    "@xmath43 could in principle be any combination of \\{@xmath36 } , and usually be set the average of the training set @xmath45 .",
    "any other choice of a reference model only affects the number of principal components ( pcs ) in decomposing the comoving angular diameter distances , e.g. @xmath29 in eq.([eq : decomp ] ) .",
    "it does not affect the final reconstruction of @xmath8 .",
    "the pcs are derived by solving the eigenvalue problem @xmath46 , where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the @xmath49-th eigenvalue and eigenvector respectively .",
    "the eigenvector of the largest eigenvalue is the first pc .",
    "it corresponds to the direction on which the projection of @xmath44 has the largest variance , which means that the cluster of points mainly align in this direction .",
    "the second pc is the eigenvector of the second largest eigenvalue corresponding to the direction of the secondary largest variance , and so on .",
    "since pca aims at reducing the dimensionality of the training set substantially while retaining almost all the variation , an important issue arises that how many pcs should be employed in the reconstruction of @xmath8 .",
    "the selection criterion is based on the cumulative percentage of total variation @xcite defined as : @xmath50 where @xmath51 are the eigenvalues corresponding to the pcs and sorted in a descendent sequence @xmath52 , @xmath35 is the number of total pcs , and @xmath53 is the number of pcs we shall employ in the reconstruction .",
    "the @xmath54 , varying between 0 and 100 , quantifies how much percentage of variance in the training set is preserved in the first @xmath53 pcs . after setting a threshold ( e.g. @xmath55 )",
    ", @xmath54 returns the suitable number of pcs .",
    "then the deviation of the @xmath8 from the reference model is decomposed by the @xmath53 pcs @xmath56 eq.([eq : decomp_pca ] ) is similar with eq.([eq : decomp ] ) , except that the reference model here is not zero and the basis @xmath48 is optimized via pca .",
    "the coefficients @xmath57 are determined by fitting eq.([eq : decomp_pca ] ) to @xmath33 through @xmath58 minimization .",
    "the optimal basis for decomposition of @xmath8 is also the optimal basis for decomposition of the @xmath59-independent angular comoving distances @xmath60 .",
    "when build the training set @xmath61 with @xmath59-independent angular comoving distances @xmath62 , eq.([eq : decomp_pca ] ) can be rewritten as , @xmath63 where the @xmath64 is the @xmath59-independent reference model . in the @xmath58 minimization step ,",
    "we use eq.([eq : decomp_pca2 ] ) to leave the hubble constant @xmath59 as a free parameter .",
    "the @xmath16 in eq.([eq : curv ] ) is derived by taking derivative on both side of eq.([eq : decomp_pca2 ] ) with respect to redshift .",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath2 pairs are collected from current literatures of bao measurements .",
    "since the sdss and boss cmass samples have been analyzed multiple times , we tend to use the most recent published results to avoid overlap .",
    "the @xmath65 pairs and the bao surveys are listed in table [ tab : bao ] .",
    "we consider the covariance between distances constrained by different bao samples at different redshift ranges to have negligible effect on our determination of derivative of distance with respect to redshift .",

    "the data are in form of distance modulus @xmath79 which should be converted to the luminosity distance by @xmath80 the corresponding comoving angular diameter distances are derived via the etherington s relation which holds for any space - time @xmath81 . for simplicity , we use the covariance matrix of distance modules of sne ia with statistical errors only , which is in diagonal form , during the @xmath58 minimization procedure .",
    "fig.[fig : pcs ] has depicted the first four pcs for the comoving angular diameter distances .",
    "the training set @xmath61 is built from 1000 non - flat @xmath7cdm models with the parameters uniformly sampled in the cubic parameter space with boundaries @xmath82 and @xmath83 , the sum of @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath0 can deviate from 1 . here",
    "the reference model takes the average of the training set @xmath84 .",
    "a different reference model would not change the reconstruction of @xmath8 as long as the distribution of the training set tightly enclosing the data @xcite .",
    "the first pc retains 98.8% of the total variance in the sample , which means it has already considered the major properties in the expansion of the training set .",
    "we therefore use the first pc to decompose the @xmath8 . here",
    "we emphasis that , although the pcs are determined by the training set sampled from different non - flat @xmath7cdm models , they are able to constrain other cosmologies that are not explicitly contained in the training set ( see * ? ? ?",
    "fitting eq.([eq : decomp_pca2 ] ) to the observables @xmath33 yields the coefficients @xmath85 and @xmath86  km s@xmath87 mpc@xmath87 . by substituting the coefficients and bao data into eq.([eq : decomp_pca2 ] ) and eq.([eq : curv ] ) , each @xmath65 pair has derived a curvature parameter .",
    "the upper panel of fig.[fig : curv ] has shown the @xmath0 with @xmath88 errors .",
    "the curvature measurement using high redshift data at @xmath4 has the best constrain that @xmath89 , which is consistent with the curvature @xmath90 constrained by the nine year wmap data only @xcite . at low and medium redshifts ,",
    "the deviations of @xmath0 from zero are although nearly of order unit , the measurements are still consistent with a flat universe .",
    "the lower panel of fig.[fig : curv ] has shown a trend that the errors in @xmath0 decrease with increasing redshift . by comparing the errors of the input @xmath91 data with the errors of the output @xmath0 , we have noticed that even if the bao data at higher redshift may have less precisions than the lower ones , the curvatures determined by higher redshift bao data still have smaller errors , such as 3.7% for @xmath92 and 3.5% for @xmath93 while 1.6% for @xmath94 and 3.2% for @xmath95 .",
    "consider the error propagation formula of eq.([eq : curv ] ) @xmath96 ^ 2\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\delta h}{h}\\right)^2+\\left(\\frac{\\delta d'}{d'}\\right)^2\\right]\\\\ & ~+ 4\\omega_k^2\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\delta d}{d}\\right)^2+\\left(\\frac{\\delta h_0}{h_0}\\right)^2\\right ] \\end{split } \\label{eq : errors}\\ ] ]    we can find that the behavior of @xmath97 is dominated by @xmath98 at low redshift . this feature results in large errors in the determination of curvature when using low redshift data .",
    "nevertheless , eq.([eq : errors ] ) tends to be a constant which only depends on the errors of @xmath99 when using very high redshift data , revealing that eq.([eq : curv ] ) could tightly constrain the curvature parameter via precise measurements of @xmath1 and @xmath2 at high redshifts .",
    "we repeat the procedure in previous sections to a synthetic sample simulated by a standard flat @xmath7cdm model with parameters @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 from @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties of @xmath1 and @xmath8 measurements resemble a theoretical bao cosmic variance forecast for a full - sky bao survey in table 2 of @xcite , in which case the @xmath1 and @xmath2 measurements can reach a precision of 0.2% at @xmath103 .",
