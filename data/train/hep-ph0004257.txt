    "the dominant weak decays of hadrons containing a heavy quark , @xmath1 or @xmath0 , are caused by the decay of the heavy quark . in the limit of a very large mass @xmath2 of a heavy quark @xmath3",
    "the parton picture of the hadron decay should set in , where the inclusive decay rates of hadrons , containing @xmath3 , mesons ( @xmath4 ) and baryons ( @xmath5 ) , are all the same and equal to the inclusive decay rate @xmath6 of the heavy quark .",
    "yet , the known inclusive decay rates @xcite are conspicuously different for different hadrons , especially for charmed hadrons , whose lifetimes span a range of more than one order of magnitude from the shortest @xmath7 ps to the longest @xmath8 ps , while the differences of lifetime among @xmath0 hadrons are substantially smaller .",
    "the relation between the relative lifetime differences for charmed and @xmath0 hadrons reflects the fact that the dependence of the inclusive decay rates on the light quark - gluon ` environment ' in a particular hadron is a pre - asymptotic effect in the parameter @xmath2 , which effect vanishes as an inverse power of @xmath2 at large mass .",
    "a theoretical framework for systematic description of the leading at @xmath9 term in the inclusive decay rate @xmath10 as well as of the terms relatively suppressed by inverse powers of @xmath2 is provided @xcite by the operator product expansion ( ope ) in @xmath11 .",
    "existing theoretical predictions for inclusive weak decay rates are in a reasonable agreement , within the expected range of uncertainty , with the data on lifetimes of charmed particles and with the so far available data on decays of @xmath12 mesons .",
    "the only outstanding piece of present experimental data is on the lifetime of the @xmath13 baryon : @xmath14 , for which ratio a theoretical prediction , given all the uncertainty involved , is unlikely to produce a number lower than 0.9 .",
    "the number of available predictions for inclusive decay rates of charmed and @xmath0 hadrons is sufficiently large for future experimental studies to firmly establish the validity status of the ope based theory of heavy hadron decays , and , in particular , to find out whether the present contradiction between the theory and the data on @xmath15 is a temporary difficulty , or an evidence of fundamental flaws in theoretical understanding .",
    "it is a matter of common knowledge that application of ope to decays of charmed and @xmath0 hadrons has potentially two caveats .",
    "one is that the ope is used in the minkowsky kinematical domain , and therefore relies on the assumption of quark - hadron duality at the energies involved in the corresponding decays . in other words",
    ", it is assumed that sufficiently many exclusive hadronic channels contribute to the inclusive rate , so that the accidentals of the low - energy resonance structure do not affect the total rates of the inclusive processes .",
    "theoretical attempts at understanding the onset of the quark - hadron duality are so far limited to model estimates @xcite , not yet suitable for direct quantitative evaluation of possible deviation from duality in charm and @xmath0 decays .",
    "this point presents the most fundamental uncertainty of the ope based approach , and presently can only be clarified by confronting theoretical predictions with experimental data .",
    "the second possible caveat in applying the ope technique to inclusive charm decays is that the mass of the charm quark , @xmath16 , may be insufficiently large for significant suppression of higher terms of the expansion in @xmath17 .",
    "the relative lightness of the charm quark , however , accounts for a qualitative , and even semi - quantitative , agreement of the ope based predictions with the observed large spread of the lifetimes of charmed hadrons : the nonperturbative effects , formally suppressed by @xmath18 and @xmath19 are comparable with the ` leading ' parton term and describe the hierarchy of the lifetimes .",
    "another uncertainty of a technical nature arises from poor knowledge of matrix elements of certain quark operators over hadron , arising as terms in ope .",
    "these can be estimated within theoretical models , with inevitable ensuing model dependence , or , where possible , extracted from the experimental data . with these reservations spelled out , we discuss here the ope based description of inclusive weak decays of charm and @xmath0 hadrons , with emphasis on specific experimentally testable predictions , and on the measurements , which would less rely on model dependence of the estimates of the matrix elements , thus allowing to probe the ope predictions at a fundamental level .",
    "the optical theorem of the scattering theory relates the total decay rate @xmath20 of a hadron @xmath21 containing a heavy quark @xmath3 to the imaginary part of the ` forward scattering amplitude ' . for the case of weak",
    "decays the latter amplitude is described by the following effective operator l_eff=2 i m  , [ leff ] in terms of which the total decay rate is given by . ]",
    "_ h = h_q | l_eff | h_q  .",
    "[ lgam ] the correlator in equation ( [ leff ] ) in general is a non - local operator .",
    "however at @xmath22 the dominating space - time intervals in the integral are of order @xmath11 and one can expand the correlator in @xmath23 , thus producing an expansion in inverse powers of @xmath2 .",
    "the leading term in this expansion describes the parton decay rate of the quark .",
    "for instance , the term in the non - leptonic weak lagrangian @xmath24 with @xmath25 being the appropriate combination of the ckm mixing factors , generates through eq.([leff ] ) the leading term in the effective lagrangian l^(0)_eff , nl = |v|^2 g_f^2 m_q^5 64 ^3 _ nl ( q q )  , [ lef0 ] where @xmath26 is the perturbative qcd radiative correction factor .",
    "this expression reproduces the well known formula for the inclusive non - leptonic decay rate of a heavy quark , associated with the underlying process @xmath27 , due to the relation @xmath28 , which is valid up to corrections of order @xmath29 .",
    "one also sees form this example , that in order to separate individual semi - inclusive decay channels , e.g. non - leptonic with specific flavor quantum numbers , or semi - leptonic , one should simply pick up the corresponding relevant part of the weak lagrangian @xmath30 , describing the underlying process , to include in the correlator ( [ leff ] ) .",
    "the general expression for first three terms in the ope for @xmath31 has the form @xmath32 where the superscripts denote the power of @xmath11 in the relative suppression of the corresponding term in the expansion with respect to the leading one , @xmath33 is the gluon field tensor , @xmath34 stand for light quarks , @xmath35 , and , finally , @xmath36 , @xmath37 denote spin and color structures of the four - quark operators .",
    "the coefficients @xmath38 depend on the specific part of the weak interaction lagrangian @xmath30 , describing the relevant underlying quark process .",
    "one can notice the absence in the expansion ( [ first3 ] ) of a term suppressed by just one power of @xmath11 , due to non - existence of operators of suitable dimension .",
    "thus the decay rates receive no correction of relative order @xmath11 in the limit of large @xmath2 , and the first pre - asymptotic corrections appear only in the order @xmath29 .    the mechanisms giving rise to the three discussed terms in ope are shown in figure 1 .",
    "the first , leading term corresponds to the parton decay , and does not depend on the light guark and gluon ` environment ' of the heavy quark in a hadron .",
    "the second term describes the effect on the decay rate of the gluon field that a heavy quark ` sees ' in a hadron .",
    "this term in fact is sensitive only to the chromomagnetic part of the gluon field , and contains the operator of the interaction of heavy quark chromomagnetic moment with the chromomagnetic field .",
    "thus this term depends on the spin of the heavy quark , but does not depend on the flavors of the light quarks or antiquarks .",
    "therefore this effect does not split the inclusive decay rates within flavor su(3 ) multiplets of heavy hadrons , but generally gives difference of the rates , say , between mesons and baryons .",
    "the dependence on the light quark flavor arises from the third term in the expansion ( [ first3 ] ) which explicitly contains light quark fields .",
    "historically , this part is interpreted in terms of two mechanisms @xcite : the weak scattering ( ws ) and the pauli interference ( pi ) . the ws corresponds to a cross - channel of the underlying decay , generically @xmath39 , where either the quark @xmath40 is a spectator in a baryon and can undergo a weak scattering off the heavy quark : @xmath41 , or an antiquark in meson , say @xmath42 , weak - scatters ( annihilates ) in the process @xmath43 .",
    "the pauli interference effect arises when one of the final ( anti)quarks in the decay of @xmath3 is identical to the spectator ( anti)quark in the hadron , so that an interference of identical particles should be taken into account .",
    "the latter interference can be either constructive or destructive , depending on the relative spin - color arrangement of the ( anti)quark produced in the decay and of the spectator one , thus the sign of the pi effect is found only as a result of specific dynamical calculation . in specific calculations , however , ws and pi arise from the same terms in ope , depending on the hadron discussed , and technically there is no need to resort to the traditional terminology of ws and pi .    0.9 mm    ( 140.00,84.00)(10,0 ) ( 10.00,70.00)(1,0)20.00 ( 30.00,70.00)(1,0)30.00 ( 60.00,70.00)(1,0)20.00 ( 30.00,70.00)(45.00,84.00)(60.00,70.00 ) ( 30.00,70.00)(45.00,56.00)(60.00,70.00 ) ( 30.00,70.00 ) ( 60.00,70.00 ) ( 20.00,72.00)(0,0)[cb]@xmath3 ( 70.00,71.00)(0,0)[cb]@xmath3 ( 49.00,78.00)(0,0)[cb]@xmath44 ( 49.00,71.00)(0,0)[cb]@xmath45 ( 49.00,62.00)(0,0)[ct]@xmath46 ( 10.00,43.00)(1,0)20.00 ( 30.00,43.00)(1,0)30.00 ( 60.00,43.00)(1,0)20.00 ( 30.00,43.00)(45.00,57.00)(60.00,43.00 ) ( 30.00,43.00)(45.00,29.00)(60.00,43.00 ) ( 30.00,43.00 ) ( 60.00,43.00 ) ( 20.00,45.00)(0,0)[cb]@xmath3 ( 70.00,44.00)(0,0)[cb]@xmath3 ( 49.00,51.00)(0,0)[cb]@xmath44 ( 49.00,44.00)(0,0)[cb]@xmath45 ( 49.00,35.00)(0,0)[ct]@xmath46 ( 45.00,36.00)(0,-1)2.00 ( 45.00,33.00)(0,-1)2.00 ( 45.00,30.00)(0,-1)2.00 ( 47.00,28.00)(0,0)[cc]@xmath47 ( 10.00,12.00)(1,0)20.00 ( 30.00,12.00)(1,0)30.00 ( 60.00,12.00)(1,0)20.00 ( 30.00,12.00)(45.00,26.00)(60.00,12.00 ) ( 30.00,12.00 ) ( 60.00,12.00 ) ( 20.00,14.00)(0,0)[cb]@xmath3 ( 70.00,13.00)(0,0)[cb]@xmath3 ( 49.00,20.00)(0,0)[cb]@xmath44 ( 49.00,13.00)(0,0)[cb]@xmath45 ( 10.00,5.50)(3,1)20.00 ( 60.00,12.00)(4,-1)20.00 ( 20.00,7.00)(0,0)[ct]@xmath40 ( 70.00,8.00)(0,0)[ct]@xmath40 ( 87.00,70.00)(1,0)11.00 ( 87.00,43.00)(1,0)11.00 ( 87.00,12.00)(1,0)11.00 ( 110.00,70.00)(1,0)30.00 ( 116.00,71.00)(0,0)[cb]@xmath3 ( 134.00,71.00)(0,0)[cb]@xmath3 ( 110.00,43.00)(1,0)30.00 ( 116.00,44.00)(0,0)[cb]@xmath3 ( 134.00,44.00)(0,0)[cb]@xmath3 ( 125.00,43.00)(0,-1)2.00 ( 125.00,40.00)(0,-1)2.00 ( 125.00,37.00)(0,-1)2.00 ( 127.00,35.00)(0,0)[cc]@xmath47 ( 110.00,12.00)(1,0)30.00 ( 116.00,13.00)(0,0)[cb]@xmath3 ( 134.00,13.00)(0,0)[cb]@xmath3 ( 110.00,7.00)(3,1)15.00 ( 125.00,12.00)(3,-1)15.00 ( 117.00,9.00)(0,0)[lt]@xmath48 ( 132.00,9.00)(0,0)[rt]@xmath48 ( 125.00,62.00)(0,0)[cc ] @xmath49 ( 125.00,27.00)(0,0)[cc ] @xmath50 ( 125.00,0.00)(0,0)[cc ] @xmath51 ( 123.50,70.00 ) ( 123.50,43.00 ) ( 123.50,12.00 )    [ fig : ope ]    in what follows we discuss separately the effects of the three terms in the expansion ( [ first3 ] ) and their interpretation within the existing and future data .",
    "the leading term in the ope amounts to the perturbative expression for the decay rate of a heavy quark . in @xmath0 hadrons",
    "the contribution of the subsequent terms in ope is at the level of few percent , so that the perturbative part can be confronted with the data in its own right . in particular , for the @xmath52 meson the higher terms in ope contribute only about 1% of the total non - leptonic as well as of the semileptonic decay rate .",
    "thus the data on these rates can be directly compared with the leading perturbative term in ope .",
    "the principal theoretical topic , associated with this term is the calculation of qcd radiative corrections , i.e. of the factor @xmath26 in eq.([lef0 ] ) and of a similar factor , @xmath26 , for semileptonic decays .",
    "it should be noted , that even at this , perturbative , level there is a known long - standing problem between the existing data and the theory in that the current world average for the semileptonic branching ratio for the @xmath12 mesons , @xmath53 , is somewhat lower than the value @xmath54 preferred from the present knowledge of theoretical qcd radiative corrections to the ratio of non - leptonic to semileptonic decay rates ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , this apparent discrepancy may in fact be due to insufficient ` depth ' of perturbative qcd calculation of the ratio @xmath55 . in order to briefly elaborate on this point , we notice that the standard way of analyzing the perturbative radiative corrections in the nonleptonic decays is through the renormalization group ( rg ) summation of the leading log terms and the first next - to - leading terms @xcite in the parameter @xmath56 . for",
    "the semileptonic decays the logarithmic dependence on @xmath57 is absent in all orders due to the weak current conservation at momenta larger than @xmath58 , thus the correction is calculated by the standard perturbative technique , and a complete expression in the first order in @xmath59 is available both for the total rate @xcite and for the lepton spectrum @xcite . in reality",
    "however the parameter @xmath60 is not large , and non - logarithmic terms may well compete with the logarithmic ones .",
    "this behavior is already seen from the known expression for the logarithmic terms : when expanded up to the order @xmath61 the result of ref.@xcite for the rate of decays with single final charmed quark takes the form = 1 + _ s + _",
    "s^2 ^2  , [ as2l ] where , in terms of notation of ref.@xcite , @xmath62 .",
    "the behavior of the function @xmath63 is known explicitly @xcite and is quite weak : @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 for the realistic mass ratio @xmath67 .",
    "one can see that the term with the single logarithm @xmath68 contributes about two thirds of that with @xmath69 in the term quadratic in @xmath59",
    ". under such circumstances the rg summation of the terms with powers of @xmath68 does not look satisfactory for numerical estimates of the qcd effects , at least at the so far considered level of the first next - to - leading order terms , and the next - to - next - to - leading terms can be equally important as the two known ones , which would eliminate the existing impasse between the theory and the data on @xmath70 .",
    "one can present some arguments @xcite that this is indeed the case for the @xmath0 quark decay , although a complete calculation of these corrections is still unavailable .",
    "the corrections suppressed by two powers of @xmath11 to inclusive decay rates arise from two sources @xcite : the @xmath71 corrections to the matrix element of the leading operator , @xmath72 , and the second term in ope ( [ first3 ] ) containing the chromomagnetic interaction .",

    "the discussed corrections are rather small for @xmath0 hadrons , given that @xmath100 .",
    "the largest , in relative terms , effect of these corrections in @xmath12 meson decays is on the semileptonic decay rate , where it amounts to 4  5 % suppression of the rate , which rate however is only a moderate fraction of the total width . in the dominant non - leptonic decay rate",
    "the effect is smaller , and , according to the formula ( [ gamnum ] ) amounts to about 1.5  2 % .",
    "the effect of the @xmath29 corrections can be evaluated with a somewhat better certainty for the ratio of the decay rates of @xmath13 and @xmath12 mesons .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath101 , since there is no correlation of the spin of the heavy quark in @xmath13 with the light component , having overall quantum numbers @xmath102 .",
    "then , applying the formula ( [ gamnum ] ) to @xmath12 and @xmath13 , we find for the ratio of the ( dominant ) non - leptonic decay rates : = 1 -_^2(_b)-_^2(b ) 2 m_b^2 + 0.5 _ g^2(b ) m_b^2  .",

    "the estimated difference of the kinetic terms is remarkably small .",
    "thus the effect in the ratio of the decay rates essentially reduces to the chromomagnetic term , which is also rather small and accounts for less than 1% difference of the rates . for the ratio of the semileptonic decay rates the chromomagnetic term is approximately four times larger , but",
    "then the contribution of the semileptonic rates to the total width is rather small .",
    "thus one concludes that the terms of order @xmath106 in the ope expansion for the decay rates can account only for about 1% difference of the lifetimes of @xmath13 and the @xmath12 mesons .",
    "the significance of the @xmath29 terms is substantially different for the decay rates of charmed hadrons , where these effects suppress the inclusive decays of the @xmath76 mesons by about 40% with respect to those of the charmed hyperons in a reasonable agreement with the observed pattern of the lifetimes .",
    "it should be emphasized once again that the @xmath29 effects do not depend on the flavors of the spectator quarks or antiquarks .",
    "thus the explanation of the variety of the inclusive decay rates within the flavor su(3 ) multiplets , observed for charmed hadrons and expected for the @xmath0 ones , has to be sought among the @xmath107 terms .",
    "although the third term in the expansion ( [ first3 ] ) is formally suppressed by an extra power of @xmath11 , its effects are comparable to , or even larger than the effects of the second term .",
    "this is due to the fact that the diagrams determining the third term ( see fig .",
    "1 ) contain a two - body phase space , while the first two terms involve a three - body phase space .",
    "this brings in a numerical enhancement factor , typically @xmath109 .",
    "the enhanced numerical significance of the third term in ope , generally , does not signal a poor convergence of the expansion in inverse heavy quark mass for decays of @xmath0 , and even charmed , hadrons the numerical enhancement factor is a one time occurrence in the series , and there is no reason for similar ` anomalous ' enhancement among the higher terms in the expansion .    here",
    "we first present the expressions for the relevant parts of @xmath108 for decays of @xmath0 and @xmath1 hadrons in the form of four - quark operators and then proceed to a discussion of hadronic matrix elements and the effects in specific inclusive decay rates .",

    "can be related to the non - singlet matrix elements ( [ defxy ] ) ( normalized at @xmath164 ) as @xmath257~. \\label{das}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] furthermore , with the help of the equations ( [ d1 ] ) and ( [ d2 ] ) relating the matrix elements @xmath23 and @xmath184 to the differences of the total decay widths within the triplet of charmed hyperons , one can eliminate @xmath23 and @xmath184 in favor of the measured width differences .",
    "the resulting expression has the form @xmath258 = \\nonumber \\\\ -10^{-7 } \\left [ 0.97 \\left ( \\gamma(\\xi_c^0)-\\gamma(\\lambda_c ) \\right ) + 0.09 \\left ( \\gamma(\\lambda_c)-\\gamma(\\xi_c^+ ) \\right ) \\right ] \\ , \\left ( { 1.4 \\ , gev \\over m_c } \\right ) ^2 \\ , ps ~ , \\label{dasm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , clearly , in the latter form the widths are assumed to be expressed in @xmath259 , and @xmath260 is used as a ` reference ' value for the charmed quark mass .",
    "it is seen from eq.([dasm ] ) that the evaluation of the difference of the amplitudes within the discussed approach is mostly sensitive to the difference of the decay rates of @xmath193 and @xmath187 , with only very little sensitivity to the total decay width of @xmath188 . using the current data the difference @xmath261",
    "is estimated as a= -(5.4 2 ) 10 ^ -7  , [ dasn ] with the uncertainty being dominated by the experimental error in the lifetime of @xmath193 .",
    "an amplitude @xmath262 of the magnitude , given by the central value in eq.([dasn ] ) would produce a decay rate @xmath263 , which result can also be written in a form of triangle inequality +  .",
    "[ tri ]    although at present it is not possible to evaluate in a reasonably model independent way the matrix element in eq.([xib ] ) for the ` spectator ' decay amplitude , the inequality ( [ tri ] ) shows that at least some of the discussed pion transitions should go at the level of @xmath264 , similar to the rates of analogous decays of ` light ' hyperons .",
    "we summarize here specific predictions for the inclusive decay rates , which can be argued with a certain degree of theoretical reliability , and which can be possibly experimentally tested in the nearest future .",
