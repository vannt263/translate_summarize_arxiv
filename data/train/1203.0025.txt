    "[ introsec ]    dust provides an important observational avenue for investigating a variety of astrophysical environments .",
    "though dust amounts to only a fraction ( @xmath41/100 ) of the gaseous mass , it is an efficient radiator and thus provides clues to the energy content of the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "dust grains are heated by a variety of sources , such as stellar radiation or collisions with gas , and re - radiates most of this energy as thermal emission . for temperatures characteristic of the ism , thermal",
    "emission from dust is predominantly at far infrared ( ir ) and submillimeter wavelengths .",
    "consequently , properties of the far - ir and sub - mm spectral energy distribution ( sed ) can provide vital information about the physical state of observed systems .",
    "for example , the amount of emergent ir flux scales proportionally with the star formation rate in ( ultra ) luminous infrared galaxies ( [ u]lirgs , e.g. , @xcite ) ; sed shapes indicate the evolutionary state of star forming cores within molecular clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; and grain evolution in protoplanetary disks can be modeled using measured seds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "understanding dust seds therefore represents a crucial step in numerous research fields spanning a wide range of spatial scales .",
    "ground and space based telescopes , such as _ iras _ , _ iso _ , _ spitzer _ , _ herschel _ , _ planck _ ,",
    "scuba(2 ) , mambo(2 ) , saboca , and new instruments on _ sofia _ have and continue to measure ir emission , with the aim of quantifying dust seds .    at far - ir wavelengths ( @xmath5  -.5ex  60 @xmath6 ) the shape of seds due to thermal emission from dust",
    "is empirically found to be well represented as a planck function , @xmath7 , evaluated at the dust temperature @xmath0 , modified by a power law in frequency , @xmath8 @xcite : @xmath9 here , @xmath10 is the solid angle of the observing beam , @xmath11 is the column density , @xmath7 is the planck function , and @xmath12 is the opacity of the emitting dust . note that @xmath13 is the optical depth at frequency @xmath14 .",
    "an essential assumption in equation 1 is that dust is optically thin , so that @xmath15 .",
    "following convention , we assume that the opacity @xmath16 is known , and employ @xmath17 @xcite , which accounts for the dust - to - gas ratio , so that the free parameter in the fit is the gas column density @xmath11 .",
    "the spectral index @xmath1  determines the opacity @xmath18 of the dust , and encodes information about grain composition .",
    "usually , @xmath1  is found to be @xmath42 for silicate and/or carbonaceous grain composition common in the diffuse ism @xcite .",
    "numerous observational investigations have focused on measuring the value of @xmath1 .",
    "most observational analyses estimate @xmath0  and @xmath1  by employing a least - squares ( @xmath2 ) sed fit .",
    "however , due to the degeneracy between @xmath0  and @xmath1 , known since the earliest efforts to derive dust properties from a limited number of far - ir and submillimeter measurements @xcite , @xmath2  fits underestimating @xmath1  will naturally overestimate @xmath0  @xcite , or vice versa .",
    "erroneous estimates of @xmath0  and/or @xmath1  may arise due to the inaccurate assumption of a constant temperature along the line - of - sight @xcite , or uncertainty in the flux measurements . additionally , the presence of internal sources may also yield an artificial @xmath3  anti - correlation in the estimated sed @xcite .",
    "@xcite demonstrate through monte carlo simulations that modest noise levels can lead to spurious @xmath3  anti - correlations . employing models of isothermal sources with constant @xmath1 , they show that due to uncertainties as low as 5% , @xmath2  fits produce erroneous @xmath0  and @xmath1  estimates",
    ". moreover , the fits result in an artificial @xmath3  anti - correlation which is remarkably similar to the trend derived from observational investigations .",
    "@xcite conclude that @xmath2  sed fits can not reliably reveal the true @xmath3  correlation under realistic conditions where noise is present .",
    "this @xmath3  degeneracy may have obscured the relationship between dust temperature and composition present in astrophysical sources .",
    "observational investigations employing careful statistical analyses also conclude that the @xmath3  anti - correlation derived from @xmath2fits may be spurious .",
    "@xcite demonstrate that though a @xmath2  fit to fluxes from the starless core tmc-1c produces the anti - correlation , due to the degeneracy between @xmath0  and @xmath1",
    "the data is also consistent with a constant @xmath1  throughout the source .",
    "using radiative transfer modeling , @xcite suggest that line - of - sight temperature variations may be responsible for the @xmath2  estimate of a decrease in @xmath1  towards an internally heated core .    accurately measuring @xmath1  and",
    "@xmath0  is essential for understanding grain growth and evolution . under the dust coagulation scenario ,",
    "a higher frequency of dust agglomeration in dense regions results in increased grain sizes .",
    "in protoplanetary disks , @xmath1  is usually measured to be  -.5ex  1 , lower than the larger scale ism value of @xmath1  @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "@xcite found some indications of a decrease in @xmath1  towards higher density gas in the orion molecular cloud . in broad terms , temperatures are generally lower in higher density regions ( away from embedded sources ) due to more effective shielding from the ambient interstellar radiation field .",
    "thus , in the dust coagulation scenario the decrease in @xmath1  towards denser regions should be associated with a decrease in temperature and an increase in density .    on the other hand",
    ", @xmath2  sed fitting from various sources  from starless cores to entire galaxies  suggests that @xmath1  increases with decreasing @xmath0 . using _",
    "iras _ and balloon - borne _ pronaos _ observations of various sources , @xcite found an inverse correlation between the spectral index and temperature , with @xmath1ranging from 0.8 to 2.4 , and @xmath0  ranging from 11 to 80 k. @xcite suggested that the hyperbolic shape of the @xmath3anti - correlation may have a physical basis , such as a variation of dust composition with temperature .",
    "found a similar trend from a sample of lirgs , although @xcite argue that the optically thin isothermal sed model is inappropriate for extra - galactic sources , at least for sub - mm galaxies .",
    "more recently , seds derived from _",
    "herschel _ and _ planck _ observations have also conveyed @xmath3  anti - correlations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these results are interpreted to be in agreement with laboratory studies : laboratory measurements of some amorphous materials also show a @xmath3  anti - correlation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , those laboratory results depend on grain composition and wavelength , and do not consider how variations in ( volume ) densities similar to the range found in the ism can affect the results .",
    "the comparison is further complicated by the spurious anti - correlation arising in @xmath2  fits due to noise @xcite , and by variations of temperature and dust composition along the line - of - sight @xcite .    properly treating the degeneracy between @xmath0  and @xmath1  is thus a necessity for accurately fitting dust seds and assessing any variation of grain properties with temperature .",
    "the motivation for this work stems from the @xmath3  anti - correlation found in observational analysis which appear to be very similar to the spurious anti - correlation due solely to statistical uncertainties @xcite .",
    "the main goal of this work is to develop a sed fitting method that rigorously treats statistical uncertainties so that spurious @xmath3  anti - correlations are avoided . to satisfy these conditions ,",
    "we introduce a hierarchical bayesian approach for fitting an ensemble of dust seds .",
    "hierarchical modeling is a statistical framework that was developed to handle data analysis problems with multiple stages ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "hierarchical models are preferred for complex data analysis problems , as they are able to effectively handle multiple sources of uncertainty at all stages of the data anaysis .",
    "sources of statistical uncertainties include random noise and calibration ( correlated ) errors , which can contribute both multiplicative and additive components .",
    "hierarchical models can account for correlated uncertainties and degeneracies between parameters , and may thus avoid any spurious correlations .",
    "moreover , bayesian methods calculate the probability distribution of the parameters given the measured data , so that the uncertainties returned by the inference are rigorous and well - defined .",
    "this ensures that all sources of measurement error are properly incorporated into the uncertainties in the estimated parameters .",
    "this is in stark contrast to more traditional frequentist and approximate methods , such as the propagation of errors or the treatment of the best - fit values as the true values .",
    "frequentist approaches can lead to biases and incorrect quantification of uncertainty in complex problems .",
    "bayesian methods have been shown to avoid such biases for numerous problems in a variety of scientific disciplines , and , as we demonstrate in this work , can effectively handle the degeneracy between @xmath0  and @xmath1  in sed fitting .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we describe our hierarchical bayesian model , and contrast it with the @xmath2  fit . in section 3",
    ", we test the bayesian method on model data , and compare the results to a @xmath2  fit .",
    "we apply the bayesian fit to observed fluxes from starforming core cb244 in section 4 . after a brief discussion on the interpretation of our results in section 5",
    ", we provide a summary in section 6 .",
    "in this section , we present a hierarchical bayesian technique that simultaneously estimates the values of the column density @xmath11 , spectral index @xmath1 , and temperature @xmath0 , as well as their joint distribution , directly from a set of observed fluxes . although hierarchical bayesian modeling is becoming more common in astrophysics ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , it is not nearly as widely employed in most astrophysical fields as traditional single - level methods . in order to allow the reader to become familiar with the hierarchical modeling approach",
    ", we begin by providing an overview of the method in section 2.1 . to guide readers familiar with single - level frequentist methods , we also contrast it with the minimized-@xmath2  fit , which is commonly employed for estimating @xmath11 , @xmath1 , and @xmath0 . a thorough description of the particular hierarchical bayesian model we develop is subsequently given in sections 2.2 and 2.3",
    "@xcite provides a clear overview of bayesian methods , including hierarchical models , and @xcite is a good reference on methods for dealing with measurement errors ; both references also discuss markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) methods .",
    "the power of bayesian analysis is reflected in its output , which for our problem is a probability distribution for each value of @xmath19 and @xmath0 for each pixel , as well as for the parameters defining the joint distibution of @xmath19 and @xmath0 , given the measured data .",
    "the probability distribution of the parameters given the observed data is called the _",
    "posterior _ distribution , and provides a complete and straight - forward description of our uncertainty in the parameters .",
    "this is contrasted with the output of the frequentist methods , such as @xmath2 or maximum - likelihood estimates , as frequentist methods provide a point estimate of the parameters and sometimes an estimate of a confidence region . however , while bayesian posteriors are exact , the frequentist analogues , i.e. , confidence regions , are often difficult to estimate for complex problems , such as the one we are adressing .      traditionally , parameters for sed models have been estimated by minimizing @xmath2 .",
    "more recently , non - hierarchical bayesian methods have been used to estimate the parameters for individual pixels or sources @xcite .",
    "these methods are appropriate if the goal is to estimate the sed parameters for a single pixel or source , as there is only one level to the data analysis problem : the measured flux values are generated from the sed parameters for an individual pixel or source . in this case , one only needs a measurement model for the data , e.g. , that the measured data are obtained by contaminating the sed at the observational wavelengths with gaussian measurement noise .",
    "however , for most scientific problems of interest , the data analysis problem has multiple stages , for which traditional non - hierarchical methods , such as those based on @xmath2 , are not applicable and lead to biases . within the context of the problem that we are addressing , namely the distribution of parameters for dust seds , there are at least two levels to the data analysis problem .",
    "first , there is the level corresponding to how the sed parameters for individual pixels or sources are generated from the distribution of these parameters .",
    "second , there is the level corresponding to how the measured fluxes are generated from the sed parameters for individual pixels or sources .",
    "the point of hierarchical modeling is to model and fit both levels simultaneously .    under the traditional non - hierarchical approach , statistical inference at the first ( distribution )",
    "level would be performed using the best - fit results from the second ( individual sed ) level ; i.e. , the distribution of the sed parameters is estimated directly from the best - fit values for individual pixels or sources obtained by minimizing @xmath2 , effectively treating the best - fit values as if they were the true values .",
    "however , these best - fit values are estimated with error .",
    "the distribution of the estimates is the convolution of the distribution of the true values of the sed parameters with the error distribution of their estimates .",
    "therefore , the distribution of the quantities estimated using non - hierarchical methods will always be a biased estimate of the distribution of the true values , or rather the distribution of the values that would have been obtained in the absence of measurement errors . within the context of the @xmath1@xmath0 relationship",
    ", this implies that the distribution of @xmath1 and @xmath0 estimated using the @xmath2-based estimates will always be biased toward an anti - correlation , as the error distribution of @xmath1 and @xmath0 is anti - correlated .",
    "this is a mathematical fact and is true for any value of the @xmath20 , although distributions inferred from higher @xmath20 data will not be as biased .",
    "the reason for this is because the traditional non - hierarchical methods do not effectively treat errors at all levels of the data analysis problem .    within the context of estimating sed parameters and their distribution ,",
    "a hierarchical model is constructed by invoking a model for the distribution of sed parameters , as well as a model for the measured data .",
    "the model for the distribution of sed parameters has its own set of free parameters , and all that is assumed is the functional form .",
    "for example , one could assume that the distribution of sed parameters is a gaussian distribution , and then the free parameters would be the mean and covariance of the sed parameters . both the model for the distribution of the sed parameters , and the sed parameters for individual pixels or sources ,",
    "are fit simultaneously .",
    "this approach is able to effectively handle uncertainty at all levels of the data analysis problem , and thus does not suffer from the biases that traditional non - hierarchical approaches do when estimating the distribution of sed parameters .",
    "moreover , because one assumes a model for the distribution of the sed parameters , and fits all of the pixels or sources simultaneously , one is able to obtain more precise estimates of the sed parameters for individual sources as all of the information is pooled together .",
    "the difference between the traditional and hierachical modeling approaches may be more easily understood by using an analogy with astronomical imaging . as an example , consider the @xmath1@xmath0 distribution .",
    "the distribution of the estimated values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 is the convolution of the distribution of the true values with their banana - shaped error distribution .",
    "therefore , the error distribution of @xmath1 and @xmath0 can be thought of as a ` psf ' which acts on the image of the distribution of the true values of the parameters in the @xmath1@xmath0 plane , causing the observed image of the parameters in the @xmath1@xmath0 plane to be a blurred version of the true image .",
    "if all pixels or sources have the same value of @xmath1 and @xmath0 , then the image of the true values in the @xmath1@xmath0 plane is that of a ` pointsource ' , and the image of the estimated values is just the banana - shaped ` psf ' ( i.e. , the error distribution ) .",
    "if there is any spread in the @xmath1 and @xmath0 values , then the true image in the @xmath1@xmath0 plane is that of an ` extended source ' . in order to effectively estimate the image of the true distribution of the parameters in the @xmath1@xmath0 plane ,",
    "it is necessary to deconvolve the image of the observed distribution with the error distribution . as we will show in   [ s - likfunc ] , the methods which employ @xmath2-based estimates implicitly assume that the distribution of the parameters in the @xmath1@xmath0 plane is uniform over all possible values . similarly , non - hierarchical bayesian methods which treat the pixels or sources independently also employ this assumption . because of the assumption of a uniform distribution , the non - hierarchical methods are not able to deconvolve the image of the estimates in the @xmath1@xmath0 plane from the error distribution as both the image of the true and estimated distribution are expected to look the same under this assumption .",
    "therefore , both the @xmath2 and non - hierarchical bayesian methods do not recover the true image of the distribution and are biased .",
    "however , the hierarchical modeling framework is able to do the deconvolution because it also employs a model for the ` source ' image , i.e. , the image of the true distribution in the @xmath1@xmath0 plane",
    ". therefore , the hierarchical model significantly improves on the simpler methods , and provides more accurate estimates of the @xmath1@xmath0 distribution .",
    "another advantage of hierarchical modeling is that is it possible to divide the measurement process into multiple levels .",
    "this therefore enables us to treat both additive measurement noise and multiplicative calibration errors .",
    "traditional methods usually assume a simple single - level measurement model , and dealing with multiple kinds of measurement error can be difficult for these approaches . however , it is easy to develop a hierarchical model which appropriately treats multiple levels or sources of measurement error .    in this work ,",
    "we develop a hierarchical model for the analysis of far - ir seds of astronomical dust .",
    "we perform bayesian inference on our model , as the uncertainties at all levels of the model are exact and straight - forward to interpret under the bayesian approach .",
    "while it is also possible to perform frequentist inference using a hierarchical model , we do not do this as the uncertainties on the estimated quantities are harder to estimate and interpret .",
    "moreover , hierarchical models lend themselves natually to mcmc algorithms , so bayesian methods are also computationally straight - forward .",
    "we model the dust sed as a modified black body , given by equation ( [ eq - modbbody ] ) .",
    "in addition , we multiply equation ( [ eq - modbbody ] ) by a ` color - correction ' factor , which corrects the measured flux values for the varying sed across the photometeric band , and , if available , is usually given in a tabulated form in the observer s manual for an instrument .",
    "the color - correction factor is given as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "the sed fomulated by equation ( [ eq - modbbody ] ) is applicable to optically thin dust emission along lines - of - sight with a single temperature .",
    "consequently , sources with a significant amount of high - density material where dust becomes optically thick , and/or with large temperature gradients , will exhibit seds which can not be accurately described by equation ( [ eq - modbbody ] ) .",
    "we will modify our technique in future work to implement a more realistic model for the sed in such cases ; however , we note that the goal of this paper is to develop a method that minimizes the effects of statistical error on the scientific conclusion , and therefore isolates the systematic errors , allowing for more direct investigatations into their effects .",
    "we address the issue of systematic errors from inappropriate application of equation [ eq - modbbody ] further in section [ discussion ] .    for @xmath21 observing bands ,",
    "a map is measured for the source having @xmath22 pixels .",
    "denote the frequency of the @xmath23 band as @xmath24 , and denote the measured flux density for the @xmath25 pixel observed at @xmath24 as @xmath26 .",
    "assuming equation ( [ eq - modbbody ] ) , the measured flux densities are assumed to be related to the actual values according to the measurement equation @xmath27 here , @xmath28 is the random measurement error of the flux density due to noise at frequency @xmath29 for the @xmath25 pixel , and @xmath30 is the calibration error for the band corresponding to @xmath24 .",
    "note that the calibration error is assumed to be positive and the same for each pixel in the @xmath23 band .",
    "we assume that the noise is independent between pixels in the same map and over different observing bands , and independent of the calibration uncertainties .",
    "in addition , we assume that the calibration errors are independent over the bands .",
    "our assumption that the noise is independent between bands and independent of the calibration error is likely true .",
    "however , it is not true that the noise is independent between pixels in the same band .",
    "this is because all images are smoothed to the same resolution , therefore correlating the noise in nearby pixels .",
    "while this can in theory be accounted for , it is difficult to include in our statistical model and even more difficult to develop an efficient mcmc sampler that accounts for this . therefore , for simplicity we ignore the correlations in the noise among neighboring pixels .",
    "in addition , the calibration errors are often correlated , and therefore our assumption that they are independent may be incorrect . however , for simplicity , and because a quantified summary of the correlations in @xmath30 is typically not available , we assume the calibration uncertainties are independent .",
    "we employ a robust statistical model for the measurement errors and calibration uncertainties .",
    "this is to ensure that our conclusions are not severely affected by our assumptions regarding these errors , as robust models allow for outliers and other deviations from the modeling assumptions .",
    "we model the distributions of @xmath28 and @xmath31 , denoted as @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively , as having a student s @xmath34-distribution with degrees of freedom @xmath35 and @xmath36 , zero mean , and scale parameters @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the distribution of the measurement noise is then @xmath39 and the distribution of the calibration errors is @xmath40 here , @xmath41 is the gamma function . in this work",
    "we assume @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the scale parameters , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , define the amplitude of the noise and calibration error distributions , respectively . in the limit that @xmath44 , equations ( [ eq - tdist1 ] ) and ( [ eq - tdist2 ] ) converge to a gaussian distribution with standard deviations @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "however , unlike the gaussian distribution , the @xmath34-distribution has more probability in the tails of the distribution , making it robust against outliers ; indeed , a @xmath34-distribution is commonly used when one requires a robust statistical model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the @xmath34-distribution is often appropriate when the measurement errors are assumed to be gaussian , but their variance is only estimated and therefore unknown . in this case , the @xmath34-distribution also incorporates our uncertainty on the amplitude of the noise and calibration errors .",
    "for example , modeling @xmath28 as following a student s @xmath34-distribution corresponds to assuming that the noise is gaussian with standard deviation @xmath45 , but we estimate @xmath45 with @xmath37 .",
    "this is an appropriate model as the values of @xmath37 are typically estimated from the maps themselves , e.g. , by taking the dispersion in the pixel values in a region of the image relatively free of emission .",
    "the amplitude of the calibration uncertainties , @xmath38 , are usually available from an observer s manual , but still have some uncertainty associated with them as they are often estimated by comparing a model fit to a calibration source .",
    "when we assume that the unknown @xmath46 follows a scaled inverse-@xmath2 distribution distribution is very similar to a @xmath2 distribution and is commonly used to represent uncertainty in a variance parameter . ] with @xmath35 degrees of freedom and scale parameter @xmath47 , then @xmath28 marginally follows a student s @xmath34-distribution with @xmath35 degrees of freedom and scale parameter @xmath47 . in other words ,",
    "equation ( [ eq - tdist1 ] ) is equivalent to the following : @xmath48 here , the notation @xmath49 means that given @xmath50 , @xmath51 is drawn from the conditional probability distribution of @xmath51 given @xmath50 , @xmath52 .",
    "in addition , @xmath53 is a gaussian distribution with mean @xmath54 and variance @xmath55 , and inv-@xmath56 is a scaled inverse-@xmath2 distribution with @xmath57 degrees of freedom and scale parameter @xmath58 .    in figure [ f - inversechi2 ]",
    "we show the scaled inverse-@xmath2 distribution with 3 degrees of freedom .",
    "in addition , we compare the @xmath34-distribution with 3 degrees of freedom to a gaussian distribution .",
    "we chose a value of @xmath59 for our measurement error model because it is the smallest value for the degrees of freedom that ensures that the student s @xmath34-distribution has a finite mean and variance .",
    "a value of 3 degrees of freedom implicitly assumes that @xmath60 of the data will be outliers by more than @xmath61 . alternatively",
    ", a value of 3 degrees of freedom can be interpreted as assuming a factor of @xmath62 uncertainty on the amplitude of the noise .",
    "while this may be somewhat excessive , we prefer this conservative approach to make our results robust against inaccuracies in our statistical model , as well as unknown systematic effects .",
    "this robustness is illustrated in figure [ f - inversechi2 ] , which shows that outliers are expected in the @xmath34 measurement error model as opposed to the gaussian model , and the outliers are therefore down - weighted to ensure that they do not have an excessive influence on the results .",
    "the results are not strongly affected by changes in the degrees of freedom which are less than an order of magnitude , and values of @xmath63 are typical for robust models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .          in this section",
    "we derive the probability distribution for the individual values of @xmath64 , and the parameters for their joint distribution , given a set of measured dust maps , assuming the measurement model in   [ s - measmod ] .",
    "this is called the ` posterior distribution ' , and is the basis for our bayesian approach . in order to simultaneously estimate the values of @xmath65 and @xmath1 for each pixel , as well as their joint distribution , we introduce the additional step of assuming a parameteric form for the joint distribution for @xmath65 and @xmath1 .",
    "denote the set of parameters is used as a short - hand way of denoting the set of parameters for the distribution of @xmath65 and @xmath1 .",
    "once we choose a particular distribution , then @xmath66 contains the parameters for this distribution . at this point",
    "the derivation is still general so @xmath66 is left unspecified .",
    "later we will model the distribution of @xmath67 and @xmath1 as a student s @xmath34-distribution , so @xmath68 , where @xmath54 is the mean vector and @xmath69 is proportional to the covariance matrix . ] for the distribution of @xmath65 and @xmath1 for the source as @xmath66 , and denote the distribution of these quantities as @xmath70 .",
    "then , the posterior distribution is @xmath71 where @xmath72 , and @xmath73 are vectors containing the values of column density , temperature , and spectral index for the @xmath74 pixels , @xmath75 is an @xmath76 matrix containing the measured flux densities , and @xmath77 is the prior distribution on @xmath66 .",
    "the term @xmath78 is the likelihood function of the measured data .",
    "the quantity @xmath79 defines the distribution of @xmath65 and @xmath1 , while the likelihood function @xmath78 is defined by the measurement model for the maps , i.e. , how @xmath11 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 generate the measured flux densities for each map .",
    "the existence of the calibration uncertainties makes calculation of equation ( [ eq - post1 ] ) difficult , as there is no analytical form for the likelihood function of the measured data , @xmath80 .",
    "however , it is straightforward to calculate the likelihood function for the case of fixed calibration uncertainty , @xmath81 . for our @xmath34 model for the measurement noise ,",

    "our reasons for using @xmath89 are similar to the case of modeling the measurement errors ; we want to use a distribution that is robust against outlying values of @xmath65 or @xmath1 .",
    "a value of @xmath95 implies that we expect about @xmath96 of the data to be outliers by more than @xmath61 .",
    "we consider this to be a reasonable choice , but as with the measurement model , our results are not strongly affected by the choice of @xmath97 . under the @xmath34-model",
    ", one can now use equations ( [ eq - tdist_shat])([eq - xdefine ] ) in combination with equation ( [ eq - tdist2 ] ) and a prior distribution @xmath77 to calculate the posterior distribution .    in this work",

    "however , it is not true that all three of these assumptions hold . in particular ,",
    "the assumption that @xmath67 and @xmath1 are independently and uniformly distributed over some range of values is a very strong assumption and leads to estimates of these quantities that are independent for each pixel , and thus the estimated quantities are overdispersed compared to their true values .",
    "this overdispersion biases the inferred correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath0 toward an anti - correlation , such as that described by @xcite .",
    "indeed , the very fact that an anti - correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath0 is inferred from such methods shows that their assumption of statistical independence is violated , as statistically independent quantities must be uncorrelated .",
    "therefore , such methods are not self - consistent .",
    "our hierarchical bayesian approach significantly ameliorates these problems by using a more realistic model for the distribution of @xmath67 and @xmath1 , for the measurement errors , and by including the calibration uncertainties .",
    "the posterior distribution , given by equation ( [ eq - post1 ] ) , completely summarizes our information on @xmath111 and @xmath69 .",

    "the values of @xmath31 are additional parameters that are also estimated at each stage of our mcmc sampler . however , because the values of the calibration errors are of no scientific interest ( i.e. , @xmath30 is a ` nuisance ' parameter ) , we simply discard the values of @xmath31 returned by our mcmc sampler , thus marginalizing over them .",
    "the result is a set of random draws of @xmath114 and @xmath66 from equation ( [ eq - post1 ] ) .",
    "we construct our mcmc sampler using a combination of metropolis - hastings updates and gibbs sampling , where the gibbs updates are used whenever possible .",

    ", we wish to make a comment on the sensitivity of the bayesian fits to the assumed population model .",
    "the true distribution for @xmath115 and @xmath1 is unlikely to follow a @xmath34-distribution ( or gaussian , for that matter ) , but it is unlikely that errors due to this mismatch will have a significant effect on our results .",
    "this is because we are primarily interested in the moments of the data ( e.g. , the correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) , and simple models such as the @xmath34-distribution often enable us to adequately recover them .",
    "moreover , most of our analysis relies on analyzing the values of @xmath109 and @xmath110 returned by our mcmc sampler , which have their values ` corrected ' relative to the @xmath2-based estimates under the assumption that they come from a common distribution , which we assume can be approximated as a @xmath34-distribution .",
    "the degree to which the values of @xmath116 and @xmath1 are corrected for any given pixel depends on the @xmath20 of that pixel .",
    "when the @xmath20 is high , the correction is small as the information on the values of @xmath109 and @xmath110 is dominated by the information from the data . in this case , the estimated values of @xmath117 and @xmath110 for that pixel are insensitive to the choice of model for the joint distribution and will be similar to those obtained by minimizing @xmath2 . by focusing our analysis on the values of @xmath118 and @xmath119 that are returned by our bayesian approach , instead of the values of @xmath54 and @xmath69 , we are less sensitive to differences between our model and the true distribution . in general , so long as the distribution of @xmath65 and @xmath1 does not exhibit multiple modes seperated by large distances , the scientific conclusions should not be very sensitive to error due to mispecifying the statistical model .",
    "we further explore this issue in the following section .",
    "in order to illustrate the effectiveness of our bayesian approach , and its improvement over traditional @xmath2-based techniques , we apply our method to two simulated data sets .",

    ". however , most pixels for the source with mean @xmath152 k have uncertainties dominated by the calibration errors .",
    "therefore , the warmer source also provides an interesting test regarding the importance of accounting for the calibration uncertainties .",

    "in addition , to minimize the impact of uncertainties in the estimated dc - level offset , we limit our analysis to those pixels having @xmath200 as averaged over the five _ herschel _ bands , for which the formal statistical error in the dc - level offset is negligible .",
    "the coverage of pixels that we analyze using our hierarchical bayesian method is shown on the 500  map in figure [ f - coverage ] .",
    "we conservatively assume calibration uncertainties of @xmath201 for each of the _ herschel _ bands , and calibration uncertainties of @xmath202 and @xmath203 for the 870  and @xmath204  mm bands , respectively .",
    "the values we adopt are larger than the official _",
    "herschel _ science center ( hsc ) values , and our reasons are as follows .    for the pacs instrument ,",
    "the point - source calibration uncertainty is 3% and 5% at 100  and 160 , respectively .",
    "however , we have used versions of the launhardt et al .",
    "( 2012 , in prep ) data reduced with scanamorphos , a pipeline that is better suited for the analysis of extended emssion compared to high - pass filtering .",
    "high - pass filtering is another common herschel image analysis technique that removes unknown levels of extended emission and is thus better suited for point - source analysis .",
    "we note that the high - pass filtering technique removes @xmath205 noise more efficiently than other map processing techniques ; therefore our scanamophos maps may have elevated noise levels by comparison .    because we are most interested in investigating the extended emission ,",
    "we conclude that reduction techniques that remove extended emission levels , namely high - pass filtering , are not robust for out scientific goals even when they deliver data products with reduced @xmath205 noise .",
    "the main remaining uncertainties are most likely caused by beam convolution effects ( e.g. , imperfect kernels ) and possibly color corrections .",
    "these uncertainties are very hard to quantify .",
    "therefore our strategy is to adopt an inflated calibration uncertainty , meant to represent multiple independent source of uncertainty : extended emission calibration uncertainties , the uncertainties introduced by beam convolution , @xmath205 noise , and other unidentified effects .",
    "thus the final calibration uncertainties we use are 15% and are conservative compared to the hsc recomended point - source calibration uncertainties .    for spire",
    "the final hsc recommended calibration uncertainty is @xmath149 .",
    "however , the calibration for extended sources is performed by multiplying the calibration for point sources by a correction factor ( see section 5.2.8 of the spire observers manual ) .",
    "no additional extended source calibration uncertainty is discussed to our knowledge , and thus we also assume 15% uncertainty on the calibration for the spire maps .",

    "we simulate a flux value at each value of @xmath223 , incorporating the calibration error and measurement noise . through this process",
    "we build up a distribution of predicted fluxes incorporating our uncertainty in the derived parameters .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that we compare the actual measured fluxes ( which are considered fixed and known ) to a distribution of predicted fluxes , instead of simply comparing the measured fluxes at each wavelength to a single best - fit sed .",
    "because the predicted fluxes also have the calibration errors and noise folded in , they are the appropriate quantity to compare to the measured fluxes to test the quality of the fit , and not the model greybody seds .",

    "the measured values fall within this range , showing that the bayesian results are consistent with the measured data , and therefore provide an acceptable fit .",
    "we also checked the derived calibration errors and their uncertainties , in order to ensure that the derived calibrations are consistent with those obtained from the data reduction ; i.e. , that the calibration errors are consistent with @xmath104 . the estimated calibration errors and their uncertainties are also listed in table [ t - dclevels ] .",
    "the estimated calibration errors are consistent with unity , implying that we do not find any evidence for significant deviations from the calibrations performed in the data reduction which might be indicative of data systematics or model mis - specification . moreover , the posterior uncertainties in the derived calibration errors are similar to the _ a priori _ assumed values of 15% , indicating that essentially all of the information from the calibration errors comes from the prior that we have placed on them .",
    "because of this , the fact that our method incorporates the calibration errors should not be interpreted as a recalibration of the data .",
    "rather , we have included the calibration errors as nuisance parameters which are identified as an additional source of measurement error .",
    "indeed , it is not the absolute calibration which is included in our statistical model , but rather the error in the calibration . the posterior probability distributions that we obtain from our mcmc method average over the unknown calibration errors , thus ensuring that uncertainties in the calibration are also reflected in the uncertainties in the derived greybody parameters , as well as reflected in the estimated means and correlations ( also see the discussion in   [ s - cb244_systematics ] ) .    as an additional test",

    "the hierarchical bayesian estimates did a factor of @xmath62 better than the @xmath2 estimates in predicting the flux values for data that is omitted from the fit .",

    "the temperature and @xmath1 maps of cb244 are shown in figure [ f - cb244_tmap ] , along with contours of constant column density ; all maps were derived from the posterior median values .",
    "the temperature tends to decrease toward the center of the prestellar core , while the column density tends to increase toward the center .",
    "the @xmath1-map illustrates that the values of @xmath1 trace the column density values very well , with @xmath1 decreasing toward the central , more dense regions .",
    "the estimated @xmath1 values become noisy near the central dense region of the core , with more drastic spatial variations .",

    "the correlation can be parameterized as @xmath230 the scatter in @xmath1 at fixed @xmath213 is estimated to have a dispersion of @xmath231 .",
    "this value of @xmath232 argues against a constant value of @xmath1 at fixed column density .",
    "the anti - correlation between @xmath1 and column density is highly significant and is observed even if we limit our analysis to the highest @xmath233 data .",
    "the @xmath234 anti - correlation obtained from our bayesian method is much tighter than that estimated using the @xmath2 estimates .",
    "however , we caution that it is unclear if the small scatter in @xmath1 extends over the entire range in column density probed . because @xmath20 is strongly correlated with column density , the pixels with low estimated column density also have low @xmath20 . for the lower @xmath20 pixels , the model for the distribution of @xmath235 and @xmath0",
    "becomes more informative , and thus the distribution of the low @xmath213 estimates strongly depends on extrapolation from the distribution of the high @xmath213 estimates .",
    "therefore , the distribution of @xmath1 at fixed @xmath213 at low @xmath213 is primarily estimated by extrapolation from the distribution of @xmath1 at fixed @xmath213 at high @xmath213 .",
    "our simple student s t model fixes the standard deviation of the scatter in @xmath1 at fixed @xmath213 to be constant . because the scatter in @xmath1 at fixed @xmath213 is small for high @xmath213 , where the @xmath20 is high , the student s t - model therefore extrapolates the scatter in @xmath1 at fixed @xmath213 at low @xmath213 to also be small .    the increasing influence of extrapolation on our results can be seen more clearly in distribution of @xmath0 at fixed @xmath213 , where the dispersion in estimated @xmath0 at fixed @xmath213 increases down to @xmath236 , an then becomes constant .",
    "this therefore suggests that the estimated values for pixels @xmath237 are strongly influenced by extrapolation from the pixels with @xmath238 .",
    "if we had used a more flexible model , such as a mixture of gaussian functions , then the high @xmath20 data would not be as informative about the low @xmath20 data and the scatter in @xmath1 at fixed @xmath213 for the low @xmath213 data would be poorly constrained . because of this , we can not conclude that the tight anti - correlation derived from our hierarchical bayesian approach persists across the entire range of column density probed in this analysis , although we do find evidence that it is real at @xmath239 .",
    "future work will incorporate more flexible models for the distribution of @xmath235 and @xmath0 .",
    "however , we also note that the weak positive correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath0 that we observe persists if we limit ourselves to only those pixels with @xmath240 .",
    "figure [ f - cb244_betan ] also shows the distribution of the cb244 data points in the @xmath213@xmath0 plane , using both the bayesian and @xmath2-based estimates . as with the @xmath213@xmath1 distribution",
    ", we use a random draw from the posterior distribution for the bayesian estimates .",

    "however , comparison with the @xmath1-map in figure [ f - cb244_tmap ] shows that values of @xmath241 are found both in the warmer region to the east of the core , and in the cooler region to the west of the core .",
    "these results suggest that density , and not temperature , is the primary driver behind variations in @xmath1 .",
    "our analysis also enables us to investigate how @xmath1 depends on temperature at fixed column density .",
    "although we have found that @xmath1 and @xmath0 are weakly positively correlated in cb244 , this is obtained by averaging over the distribution of @xmath213 for cb244 .",
    "therefore , it is not necessarily true that @xmath1 and @xmath0 are correlated at fixed @xmath213 .",
    "we quantify the relationship between @xmath1 and @xmath0 at fixed @xmath213 by performing a linear regression of @xmath1 simultaneously on both @xmath88 and @xmath242 , which we derive from our estimated covariance matrix for @xmath243 and @xmath242 : @xmath244 interestingly , our results imply that for cb244 @xmath1 and @xmath0 are anti - correlated at fixed column density . however , when averaging over the distribution of column densities @xmath1 and @xmath0 display a weak positive correlation in cb244",
    ". the scatter in @xmath1 at fixed column density and temperature is @xmath245 , which is only @xmath246 smaller than the scatter in @xmath1 at fixed column density .",

    "as stated above , we limit our analysis to those pixels with @xmath247 over the five herschel bands , with the goal of minimizing the effect of systematic error in the zero - level of the maps , which would affect the faint regions the most .",
    "however , it is possible that our results are still affected by systematics regarding the estimated zero - level .",
    "such systematics may result from uncertainties in both the astrophysical and instrumental background levels . in both cases",
    "this would result in a spatially - correlated systematic error in all of the flux values across the map . to assess the impact of errors in the estimated zero - level",
    ", we perform a few additional checks regarding systematics in the dc - levels .",
    "however , we note that in order to fully realize the impact of data systematics on the results for a particular source more rigorous simulations should be performed .",
    "as this is beyond the scope of this paper , the tests we perform here are meant to be illustrative of the impact of data systematics on the hierarchical bayesian results , and how one might address them in practice .",
    "moreover , we also note that unaccounted systematics also affect the @xmath2-based results in a similar , if not the same , manner .",
    "thus our result that the hierarchical bayesian method leads to opposite conclusions with respect to the @xmath2 estimates regarding the correlations among sed parameters for cb244 is robust against these systematics .",
    "we first assess the impact of systematic uncertainty in the zero - levels of the data from ground based bolometers ( i.e. , scuba and mambo ) . for the ground - based data it is unlikely that the uncertainty in the zero - level is driven by uncertainty in the background emission , as the subtraction of atmospheric emission",
    "is taken care of in the measurement procedure .",
    "the mambo and scuba data are chopped at high frequency , and the restored dual beam maps automatically subtract off all atmospheric and astrophysical extended background .",
    "the information on the atmospheric emission and extended background are no longer in the data .    in order to assess the robustness of our derived correlations to systematics with respect to the ground - based data",
    ", we redid our anlysis using only the five _ herschel _ maps . using only the _",
    "herschel _ data , the spearman s rank correlation coefficient for the @xmath1@xmath0 relationship was @xmath248 and the slope of the @xmath249@xmath1 anti - correlation was @xmath250 .",
    "the @xmath1@xmath0 correlation is essentially unaffected by the removal of the ground - based data , while the @xmath249@xmath1 anti - correlation is reduced in magnitude but still present .",
    "our results are thus qualitatively robust against the zero",
    " level offsets in data from the ground  based bolometers , which frequently result from the spatial filtering techniques applied during data reduction ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "as stated earlier , cb244 is part of a larger sample of bok globules chosen to lie in relatively isolated regions .",
    "these sources were chosen in this manner so as to ensure that they have exceptionally low background emission , and thus uncertainties in the astrophysical background emission should be minimal .",
    "the uncertainty in the zero - level for the _ herschel _ maps should be driven by the uncertainty in the instrumental background . to assess the impact of mispecifying the zero - levels of the herschel data , we refit the cb244 data using only the herschel bands after adding gaussian noise to the logarithm of each of the five estimated dc - levels .",
    "the standard deviation in the log - normal noise was 5% .",
    "this value is much larger than the formal statistical uncertainty on the dc - level as estimated according to the procedure described in ",
    "[ s - cb244 ] ( i.e. , on the mean value of the best - fit gaussian function ) , but it should give us insight into how uncertainty in the dc - level affects the results .",
    "note that each pixel in a map is assumed to have the same dc - level , and thus the perturbed dc - levels introduce the same offset to each of the pixels in a given map .",
    "we did not find any significant difference to the correlations obtained when fitting the maps with the perturbed dc levels ; however , there is a large difference in the inferred mean values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 . using the perturbed data , our mcmc sampler inferred an average value for @xmath1 and @xmath0 of @xmath251 and @xmath252 .",
    "this value of @xmath159 is inconsistent with a value of @xmath253 inferred from our cb244 data and from earlier studies .",
    "moreover , for the original cb244 data , the best - fit values of the calibration errors , @xmath82 , were on average 0.7@xmath161 away from unity , which is consistent with our prior assumption that the calibration should be correct on average with an uncertainty of @xmath254 .",
    "however , for the perturbed cb244 data the best - fit values of @xmath82 were on average 1.7@xmath161 away from unity .",
    "the calibration errors derived from the perturbed data set are inconsistent with our assumption that they on average should equal unity with a dispersion of @xmath201 , correctly suggesting problems with the perturbed data set .",
    "the likely reason for this is that the error in the zero - level is partially being absorbed by the estimated values of the calibration errors , @xmath82 .    as a final test",
    ", we fix the calibration errors equal to unity and refit the data using our hierarchial bayesian method .",
    "this is equivalent to assuming that the calibration is correct and that there is no uncertainty on it .",
    "this allows us to test the impact of overestimating the calibration uncertainty , as we have conservatively assumed calibration uncertainties that are larger than the official values recommended by the herschel science center .",
    "in addition , it allows us a more direct comparison with the @xmath2 results , as the @xmath2 fits ignore the impact of calibration errors .",
    "fixing @xmath104 only resulted in small differences in the estimated mean values and correlations of @xmath255 .",
    "the derived value of spearman s rank correlation for the @xmath1@xmath0 relationship was @xmath256 when we ignored the calibration errors , compared to @xmath212 obtained when the calibration errors are included .",
    "the anti - correlation between @xmath249 and @xmath1 is actually stronger when we ignore the calibration errors , having a value of corr(@xmath257 ) = @xmath258 , compared to corr(@xmath259 ) = @xmath260 obtained when we include the calibration uncertainties .",
    "when we include the calibration errors the derived mean values are @xmath261 , @xmath262 , and @xmath263 . however , when we ignore the calibration errors we find @xmath264 , @xmath265 , and @xmath266 . using the median of the @xmath2-based estimates we find @xmath267 , @xmath268 , and @xmath269 . ignoring the calibration errors produces mean values of the sed parameters and their uncertainties that are similar to those obtained from the @xmath2-based estimates .",
    "in addition , the uncertainties in the means and correlations of the sed parameters are larger when we include the calibration errors , as the calibration uncertainty is reflected in the much larger uncertainties in the sed parameters .    changing either the dc level or calibration error results in a constant additive or multiplicative offset for each map .",
    "while these errors can alter the mean values of the sed parameters , they do not alter their correlations as the correlations are driven by the spatial variations of flux values accross the maps , and not by the mean flux value in each map .",
    "more complicated spatially - correlated data systematics may produce biases in the inferred correlations among sed parameters .",
    "simulations should be used to assess the impact on the scientific results when strong spatially correlated errors are thought to be present in a data set .",
    "the application of our hierarchical bayesian method to observed fluxes of cb244 reveals a number of interesting features .",
    "first , we find that there is only a limited range in @xmath1  and @xmath0 , with @xmath270 ( 1.8 , 2.6 ) , and @xmath0  @xmath271 ( 11 , 16 ) k. second , @xmath1  and @xmath0 are positively correlated , albeit weakly so , suggesting that the strong anti - correlation seen in previous work is driven by noise .",
    "further , the bayesian fit suggests that @xmath1  declines towards the central region of the starless core , where the temperature decreases and the column density increases ( fig .",
    "[ f - cb244_tmap ] ) .",
    "in fact , the parameterization of @xmath1  in terms of @xmath11  and @xmath0  in equation [ eq - beta_tn_anticorr ] indicates that @xmath1  is more strongly correlated with @xmath11  than on @xmath0 .",
    "while we have found a number of interesting features in our analysis of cb244 , their interpretation is more difficult . strictly speaking , our derived trends are with respect to the isothermal greybody sed parameters , which are not necessarily equivalent to the corresponding physical parameters that they are intended to estimate .",
    "thus , it is unclear if our derived correlations represent astrophysically - meaningful correlations , or are instead driven by systematics involving the data reduction , background subtraction , and sed model .",
    "such trends may be driven by variations in temperature and density along the line - of - sight , which are currently not accounted for in our analysis .",
    "for example , the apparent correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath249 can not be the actual physical correlation as there is both low and high - density gas along the line of sight .",
    "the physical cause could be a correlation between volume density and @xmath1 . in this sense",
    "it is also possible that such trends are at least in part driven by real astrophysical variations , possibly due to the growth of dust grains . in high density compressed regions of the ism",
    ", grain sizes may increase due to dust coagulation , possibly leading to an increase in @xmath1 .",
    "compared to the ism values of @xmath1  @xmath4 2 , lower @xmath1  -.5ex  1 are found in numerous studies of protoplanetary disks .",
    "the interpretation is that grains in disks are much larger than in the more diffuse ism , and that these grains are the seeds of protoplanets .",
    "the difference in grain sizes between the large scale ism and protoplanetary disks suggests that during some epoch of the star formation process , grains begin to grow . while this is an intriguing interpretation of our results we stress that we are currently not in a position to sort out the contributions to our inferred correlation from the systematics and real astrophysical variations ; future work will address systematic errors resulting from our assumptions of optically - thin isothermal dust .    in order to accurately map the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , or density structure of an observed region ,",
    "line - of - sight variations must be taken into account .",
    "for example , @xcite find that when the model @xmath1  is constant but there are temperature variations along the line - of - sight , the assumption of isothermality produces @xmath1  estimates which are inversely correlated to the fitted temperatures .",
    "line - of - sight @xmath0  variations will effect both the hierarchical bayesian and @xmath2 fits of equation ( [ eq - modbbody ] ) to the observed fluxes in the same manner .",
    "this is because the bayesian and @xmath2 estimates become equivalent in the limit of infinite @xmath20 . because our hierarchical bayesian model accounts for the statistical errors , the results obtained from it should be interpreted as an estimate of what would have been obtained if there is no measurement error .",
    "it may be that the relationships that we find between @xmath168 and @xmath213 are driven at least in part by line - of - sight variations , making their astrophysical interpretation difficult .",
    "in addition to biases due to line - of - sight variations , our hierarchical bayesian results may be biased by the optically - thin approximation to the sed .",
    "we can estimate the magnitude of this bias using the results from the cross - validation test , described in ",
    "[ s - cb244_fit ] . because the 100  map should be the most affected by the optically - thin approximation",
    ", if the optically - thin approximation is not valid we might expect the error in the 100  data that was omitted from the fit to be systematically under or overestimated .",
    "we did not notice any significant offset in the cross - validation error for either the @xmath2 or hierarchical bayesian estimates .",
    "moreover , under our assumption of @xmath272 with @xmath273 ghz , we estimate the optical depth at 100  in the core to be @xmath274 .",
    "therefore we do not find any significant evidence that the optically - thin approximation is having a strong affect on our results .",
    "we can be confident that statistical uncertainties which lead to spurious and pronounced @xmath3  anticorrelations are appropriately handled in the hierarchical bayesian method , and thus our inferred correlations are statistically significant .",
    "however , systematic errors due to mispecification of the sed model , such as line - of - sight variations , also affect our hierarchical bayesian results .",
    "there may also be difficulties with the data reduction that can introduce spatially - correlated systematic errors , such as unidentified background emission from astrophysical sources , which in turn can bias the inferred correlations .",
    "therefore at this time we can not disentagle systematic effects from real physical effects in our inferred correlations .",
    "nevertheless , because the hierarchial bayesian fits rigorously and correctly account for the statistical errors , we are now in a position to isolate the effects of systematic errors on the scientific conclusions . a thorough analysis of possible approaches to account for line - of - sight variations which does not rely on the optically - thin approximation will be investigated in a future publication .",
    "we will also apply our method to a large sample of starless cores in order to investigate if the trends derived here for cb244 extend to a larger sample , providing a more thorough treatment of data systematics .",
    "we have developed a hierarchical bayesian method that rigorously treats measurement errors for fitting single - temperature greybody seds .",
    "the bayesian method provides a probability distribution for the values of temperature @xmath0 , spectral index @xmath1 , and column density @xmath11 in each pixel ( or source ) , conditional on the measured data , as well as for the distribution of these parameters over an entire map ( for a resolved source ) or survey ( for multiple unresolved sources ) . in testing the hierarchical bayesian method on model sources ,",
    "we demonstrate that it can accurately recover the true parameters and correlations , whereas the @xmath2  fit produces an artificial @xmath3anti - correlation due to the degeneracy between @xmath0  and @xmath1 .",
    "we have applied our hierarchical bayesian model to _ herschel _ and ground - based observations of the bok globule cb244 .",
    "the bayesian fit estimates @xmath270 ( 1.8 , 2.6 ) , @xmath0  @xmath271 ( 11 , 16 ) k , which is significantly more constrained than the @xmath2  estimates .",
    "further , we find that @xmath1  and @xmath0  are weakly positively correlated , in direct opposition to the @xmath2  results .",
    "we have mapped out the spatial distribution of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath249 , and the correlations between these properties .",
    "we find that @xmath1  decreases from @xmath4 2.6 where @xmath275 , to @xmath4 1.8 in the densest region of the starless core , where @xmath276 @xmath277 .",
    "while these results may be at least partially driven by systematics regarding the data reduction and the modeling , our method properly corrects for the statistical uncertainties , illustrating that the @xmath2 results are significantly affected by noise .    due to the accuracy of the hierarchical bayesian method , and its estimate of a positive correlation between @xmath0  and @xmath1 ,",
    "it may be used to assess any @xmath3  anti - correlation found from @xmath2  fits .",
    "our analysis demonstrates that hierarchical bayesian methods can accurately estimate the dependence between sed parameters , and therefore may be used to further understand grain evolution in the ism .",
