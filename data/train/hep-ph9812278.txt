    "determining the angles of the ckm unitarity triangle , denoted by @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath0 , is one of the important aims of the @xmath1-factories .",
    "methods have been suggested to determine @xmath0 ( @xmath17 arg ( @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the ckm matrix ) using decays of @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( and their cp - conjugates ) to two pseudoscalars belonging to the @xmath13 octet including the effects of the electroweak penguin ( ewp ) diagrams .",
    "these methods rely on the flavor @xmath13 symmetry .",
    "many of these methods neglect the effects of ( soft ) final state rescattering .",
    "in particular , the decay amplitude for @xmath22 is assumed to contain only the weak phase @xmath23 from the penguin diagram with the top quark in the loop .",
    "tree level operators have the weak phase @xmath24 , but since they have the transition @xmath25 , they contribute , in the absence of rescattering , only through annihilation to this decay .",
    "annihilation contributions are argued to be small since they are suppressed by @xmath26 ( in the absence of significant rescattering effects ) .",
    "assuming that the @xmath22 amplitude has no @xmath24 weak phase , references @xcite have suggested methods to determine @xmath0 .",
    "however , rescattering from an intermediate state , for example @xmath27 , created by a ( color - allowed ) spectator decay of a @xmath28 due to tree level operators , can generate a significant amplitude with the weak phase @xmath24 in the decay @xmath29 as well .",
    "so it would be better to have a method to determine @xmath0 which does not use the assumption of no rescattering effects .",
    "rescattering might also enhance annihilation contributions @xcite and thus necessitates their inclusion .",
    "buras and fleischer @xcite gave a method to determine @xmath0 _ without _ neglecting rescattering using @xmath30 , @xmath31 decays and time _ dependent _ measurements of the @xmath32 decay . for this method",
    ", they also require time dependent analysis of , for example , @xmath33 to measure @xmath16 .",
    "gronau and pirjol @xcite suggested a method using time independent measurements of _ all _ the @xmath34 and @xmath35 modes . in their method also rescattering effects are included .",
    "however , it might be diffcult to measure the neutral modes of @xmath21 decays since that will involve tagging at hadron machines .    in this paper , we suggest a technique to determine @xmath0 _ including _ rescattering effects ( and the ewp operators ) using @xmath1 meson decays to @xmath2 s and @xmath3 s .",
    "we will illustrate this technique using four cases ; see table [ cases ] .     &",
    "+ & + & & + case & @xmath7 & @xmath36 + & & + & & + @xmath6 & @xmath37 & @xmath38 + & & + & @xmath39 & @xmath40 + & & + & & + & & + @xmath41 & @xmath42 & @xmath43 + & & + & @xmath39 & ( cp - averaged ) + & & + & & + & & + @xmath44 & @xmath45 & @xmath46 + & & + & @xmath47 & @xmath48 + & & + & & + & & + @xmath8 & @xmath49 & @xmath50 + & & + & @xmath51 ( cp - averaged ) & @xmath48 + & & + & & +    we do _ not _ require any time dependent studies .",
    "the strategy is as follows . in cases",
    "[ intro ] and [ bpipi ] , using @xmath4 @xmath5 decay modes , we determine the strong phases and magnitudes of the tree level and penguin contributions as functions of @xmath0 ( assuming flavor @xmath52 symmetry ) .",
    "then , using flavor @xmath13 symmetry , we _ predict _ the rate for _ one _ @xmath53 mode in case [ bpipi ] . in case",
    "[ intro ] , two @xmath54 modes have to be measured to make a prediction for a third @xmath54 mode .",
    "the measurement of the decay for which we have a prediction ( as a function of @xmath0 ) then determines @xmath0 .",
    "a similar idea can be applied to predict a @xmath5 decay mode as a function of @xmath0 using measurements of @xmath10 ( and some @xmath7 ) modes ( cases [ bpik ] and [ conclude ] ) .",
    "the @xmath49 , @xmath55 modes should be relatively accessible at the @xmath14 and hadron machines . for",
    "the @xmath56 decays to a cp eigenstate , we require ( external ) tagging ( _ i.e. , _ the cp - averaged decay rate is not sufficient ) .",
    "the @xmath21 decay modes were accessible at lep1 and will be accessible at hadron machines .",
    "the @xmath57 decay mode ( case [ intro ] ) might be hard to measure since it requies tagging whereas in cases [ bpipi ] and [ conclude ] , the @xmath21 modes are either `` self - tagging '' ( @xmath58 ) or a cp - averaged measurement is sufficient ( for @xmath59 , @xmath60 ) . in case [ intro ] , we show that if we measure additional @xmath56 modes , a cp - averaged measurement of the decay rate @xmath57 is sufficient .",
    "although flavor @xmath13 symmetry is used in all the four cases ( as in all the other methods mentioned above ) , in the last section , we discuss how to take into account @xmath13 breaking .",
    "we will write the decay amplitudes for the decays @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is a pseudoscalar belonging to the flavor @xmath13 octet , in terms of the 5 linearly independent @xmath13 invariant amplitudes denoted by @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 ( where @xmath68 and @xmath69 stand for the parts of these amplitudes generated by tree level and penguin operators , respectively ) .",
    "these @xmath13 invariant amplitudes include rescattering effects .",
    "the annihilation amplitudes , @xmath70 , are the ones in which the quark index @xmath71 of @xmath72 is contracted directly with the hamiltonian .",
    "neglecting rescattering effects is equivalent to assuming @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "for example , the tree level part of the decay amplitude @xmath75 contains this combination of the @xmath76 amplitudes and @xmath77 .    in this notation @xcite",
    ", the amplitudes for @xmath78 decays can be written as @xmath79 @xmath80 @xmath81 here , @xmath82 ( @xmath83 and @xmath84 ) and @xmath85 , @xmath86 denote the penguin amplitudes due to @xmath87 running in the loop",
    ". can also contribute through rescattering from charm intermediate states .",
    "this rescattering generates a charm - quark penguin topology with the amplitude being proportional to @xmath88 and so can be included as part of @xmath89 . ]",
    "@xmath90 and @xmath91 are the amplitudes for @xmath92 and @xmath93 respectively or in other words the @xmath94 and @xmath95 amplitudes .    using the unitarity of the ckm matrix , _",
    "@xmath96 , we get @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "a similar notation is used for @xmath100 and @xmath101 .    in the @xmath49 decay , which contains only the @xmath94 amplitude",
    ", there is no contribution to @xmath102 from the strong penguin diagrams since these diagrams are @xmath95 .",
    "neubert and rosner @xcite showed that @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the ratio of wilson coefficients ( wc s ) of the ewp operators ( with quark @xmath87 running in the loop ) and the tree level operators in the effective hamiltonian .",
    "we expect @xmath105 since the top quark ewp diagram with @xmath106 exchange is enhanced by @xmath107 and so henceforth we neglect @xmath108 and denote @xmath109 by @xmath110 .",
    "so , we get @xmath111 @xmath112 using eqns.([notation ] ) , ( [ nrresult0 ] ) and ( [ nrresult ] ) , we can rewrite @xmath113 + @xmath114 as @xmath115 since @xmath116 and @xmath117 , we neglect the second term ( _ i.e. _ , the ewp contribution ) in the right hand side of eqn.([a2 ] ) for now and we assume @xmath118 and @xmath119 ( and similarly for @xmath120 replaced by @xmath121 ) , we get @xmath122 so that @xmath123 can be obtained directly from the @xmath49 decay rate . we have chosen a phase convention such that the strong phase of @xmath124 is zero .    from eqns.([b0 ] ) and ( [ b+- ] ) , we get @xmath125    the five quantities : @xmath123 , @xmath126 , @xmath69 , @xmath127 and @xmath128 ( where the @xmath129 s are the cp conserving strong phases ) can thus be determined as functions of @xmath0 from the measurements of the five rates : @xmath49 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 and the cp - conjugates of the @xmath56 decays .    explicitly , rotating the cp - conjugate amplitudes by @xmath132 ( and denoting them by `` bars '' ) , we get the triangle formed by @xmath49 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 ( eqns.([b+ ] ) , ( [ b0 ] ) and ( [ b+- ] ) ) : @xmath133 and the one formed by the cp - conjugate decays .",
    "these are shown in fig.[figbpipi ] ( from eqn.([approxa2 ] ) , @xmath134 ) .    from eqn.([a0 ] ) , we get @xmath135 thus , the length of @xmath136 ( obtained from fig.[figbpipi ] ) gives @xmath69 as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "the angle between @xmath136 and @xmath90 is @xmath137 ( see eqns.([approxa2 ] ) and ( [ idiff1 ] ) ) so that the orientation of @xmath136 ( obtained from fig.[figbpipi ] ) gives @xmath138 independent of @xmath0 .",
    "similarly , @xmath139 gives @xmath127 and @xmath126 ( or knowing @xmath140 and @xmath128 gives @xmath127 and @xmath126 using eqn.([a0 ] ) ) .",
    "= 0.8    [ figbpipi ]    there is a discrete ambiguity in this procedure since in fig.[figbpipi ] , the vertices @xmath141 and @xmath142 could be on opposite sides of @xmath143 .",
    "this has been discussed in the literature @xcite @xcite .",
    "all the analysis up to now actually relies only on flavor @xmath52 symmetry .",
    "the @xmath144 and @xmath57 amplitudes are given by @xcite @xmath145 @xmath146 @xmath147 from eqns.([bk+pi- ] ) and ( [ bspipi ] ) and using the notation of eqn.([notation ] ) and rearranging we get @xmath148 using eqns.([nrresult ] ) and ( [ a0 ] ) and assuming @xmath149 , we get @xmath150 _ i.e. , _ from eqns.([b+- ] ) and ( [ bkpibspipi ] ) , we see that the combination of the amplitudes @xmath151 can be obtained from the amplitude for @xmath152 by scaling the tree level contribution in the latter by @xmath153 and the penguin contribution by @xmath154 .",
    "in particular the ewp contribution ( @xmath155 ) is important in the last line of eqn.([bkpibspipi1 ] ) since , due to the ckm factors , it is comparable to the tree level contribution ( unlike in the @xmath152 decay ; see eqn.([a2 ] ) ) .    similarly , from eqns.([b0 ] ) , ( [ bk0pi0 ] ) and ( [ bspipi ] ) , we see that the combination of the amplitudes @xmath156 can be obtained from the amplitude @xmath157 by scaling the latter by ckm factors .",
    "this gives @xmath158 we emphasize again that in obtaining the last lines of eqns.([bkpibspipi1 ] ) and ( [ bkpibspipi2 ] ) , it is crucial that we use the neubert - rosner result ( eqn.([nrresult ] ) ) , _",
    "i.e. , _ that @xmath110 is calculable .",
    "if @xmath159 , we can determine @xmath160 from the decay rate @xmath161 .",
    "then , measuring the decay rate @xmath162 gives @xmath163 as a function of @xmath0 ( using eqn.([bkpibspipi1 ] ) ) ( @xmath138 , @xmath164 , @xmath69 and @xmath126 are already known as functions of @xmath0 ) .",
    "knowing @xmath160 and @xmath163 , we have a prediction for the decay rate @xmath165 ( eqn.([bkpibspipi2 ] ) ) and then @xmath0 can be determined by measuring this decay . and another in the final determination of @xmath0 from the @xmath165 rate . ]",
    "thus , we can determine @xmath0 , including rescattering effects , by measuring the @xmath166 decay modes : @xmath49 , @xmath56 and @xmath167 , @xmath162 , @xmath165 and @xmath57 ( any one ) ( or cp - conjugates of the last three modes ) .    from eqn.([bspipi ] ) , we see that the decay mode @xmath168 has only an annihilation contribution .",
    "if ( either from experimental measurement of the @xmath57 rate ( or a limit on the rate ) or a theoretical estimate including rescattering ) the annihilation amplitude @xmath169 does turn out to be small ( smaller than , say , the experimental error in the measurement of the ( magnitude ) of @xmath170 ) then , a decay rate @xmath171 can be predicted ( as a function of @xmath0 ) by simply scaling the corresponding @xmath172 amplitude by ckm factors .",
    "thus , in this case , @xmath173 decay modes : @xmath49 , @xmath56 ( and @xmath174 ) @xmath175 and any _ one _ @xmath176 are sufficient to determine @xmath0 .    as mentioned in the introduction , we require tagging to measure the @xmath168 decay mode ( _ i.e. _ , the cp - averaged rate is not sufficient in the above method )",
    ". if this tagged decay rate is hard to measure whereas the cp - averaged rate can be measured , we can proceed as follows .",
    "writing @xmath177 , the cp - averaged rate is @xmath178 .",
    "measuring the @xmath176 decay rates , from eqns.([bkpibspipi1 ] ) and ( [ bkpibspipi2 ] ) , we can determine @xmath160 ( and @xmath179 ) as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "similarly , the @xmath180 decay rates will give @xmath181 .",
    "thus , the cp - averaged @xmath168 rate can be predicted as a function of @xmath0 and its measurement gives @xmath0 .",
    "the expression for the @xmath182 decay amplitude in terms of the @xmath13 invariant amplitudes is identical to that for @xmath183 , _ including _ annihilation contributions ( unlike the decay mode @xmath162 ) , modulo ckm factors , _",
    "i.e. , _ up to @xmath184 @xcite .",
    "thus , we also have a prediction ( as a function of @xmath0 ) for this decay rate and also the rate for its cp - conjugate process including _ all _ rescattering effects .",
    "so , the measurement of this cp - averaged decay rate can be used to determine @xmath0 .",
    "using the same technique as in section [ bpipi ] , we can _ predict _ the rate for a @xmath172 ( or a @xmath35 ) decay as a function of @xmath0 _ given _ the decay rates for @xmath185 .",
    "the difference is that in the triangle construction to determine the tree level and penguin contributions to the @xmath176 amplitudes , we have to take into account the ewp contributions to the @xmath185 amplitudes ( the ewp amplitudes were neglected in the @xmath78 triangles in section [ bpipi ] ; see eqns.([a2 ] ) and ( [ approxa2 ] ) ) . , to make a _ prediction _ for @xmath54 decay modes , we did have to include the ewp contribution to the @xmath54 decay amplitudes .",
    "] so , we discuss the application of the technique again .",
    "the decay amplitudes for @xmath186 ( eqns.([bk+pi- ] ) and ( [ bk0pi0 ] ) ) can be written as @xmath187 @xmath188 where @xmath189 and @xmath190 are the amplitudes for @xmath56 decay to @xmath191 and @xmath192 respectively .",
    "then , @xmath193 using eqn.([nrresult ] ) and latexmath:[$| \\tilde{c } _ { 15}^t      @xmath49 decay ) .",
    "@xmath195 is given by @xmath196 , _",
    "i.e. , _ as mentioned earlier , the ewp contribution _ is _ important for @xmath176 decays .",
    "@xmath123 can be obtained from the @xmath49 decay rate as before .",
    "@xmath189 is given by ( in analogy to @xmath91 of section [ bpipi ] ) @xmath197    as in section [ bpipi ] , the four quantities : @xmath198 , @xmath199 , @xmath200 and @xmath201 can thus be determined as functions of @xmath0 from the measurements of the four decay rates : @xmath162 , @xmath202 and their cp - conjugates . decay amplitudes which can be written in terms of @xmath190 ( the same as for @xmath176 decays ) and @xmath203 which is a different combination of the @xmath13 invariant amplitudes than @xmath189 .",
    "thus , the @xmath204 decay rates are not useful as far as predicting the @xmath205 ( case [ bpik ] ) ( or @xmath35 in case [ conclude ] ) decay rates is concerned . ]",
    "due to the ewp contribution ( see eqn.([a3/2 ] ) ) , the triangle construction is a bit different in this case as shown below .    as before ,",
    "we multiply the cp - conjugate amplitudes by @xmath132 to get the `` barred '' amplitudes . in this case",
    "( unlike the case for @xmath90 in section [ bpipi ] ) there is an angle between @xmath190 and @xmath206 denoted by @xmath207 and their magnitudes are functions of @xmath0 ( see eqn.([a3/2 ] ) ) : @xmath208 @xmath209    given @xmath0 , we can thus construct the triangles of eqn.([a3/2 ] ) and its cp - conjugate ( see fig.[figbpik ] ) .",
    ", there is a discrete ambiguity in the orientation of the triangles . ] as in section [ bpipi ] , knowing the magnitudes and orientations of @xmath189 and @xmath210 from fig.[figbpik ] , we can determine @xmath198 , @xmath199 , @xmath211 and @xmath201 as functions of @xmath0 , using equations similar to eqns.([idiff1 ] ) and ( [ idiff2 ] ) .",
    "this construction also shows how to include the ewp contributions to the @xmath49 decay in section [ bpipi ] as follows .",
    "once ewp s are included , as for the case of @xmath190 and @xmath206 , there is an angle @xmath212 between @xmath143 and @xmath213 and the magnitude of @xmath214 will depend on @xmath0 ( see eqn.([a2 ] ) ) : @xmath215 @xmath216 where @xmath217 is given by @xmath218 .",
    "= 0.8    [ figbpik ]      the @xmath47 amplitude is given by @xcite : @xmath219 from eqns.([b0 ] ) , ( [ b+- ] ) , ( [ bk+pi- ] ) , ( [ bk0pi0 ] ) and ( [ bkk ] ) , we can see that @xmath220 can be obtained from @xmath221 and + @xmath222 can be obtained from @xmath223 by scaling the @xmath54 amplitudes by appropriate ckm factors , _",
    "i.e. , _ in this case , the decay mode @xmath224 plays the role of the decay mode @xmath168 of case [ intro ] ( compare eqns.([bspipi ] ) and ( [ bkk ] ) ) .",
    "thus , as in case [ intro ] , we can determine @xmath0 , including _ all _ rescattering effects , by measuring the @xmath166 decay modes : @xmath49 , @xmath56 and @xmath180 ( all ) , @xmath47 , @xmath131 and @xmath183 ( or cp - conjugates of the last three modes ) .",
    "if the annihilation amplitudes are small , as in case [ intro ] , we can determine @xmath0 by measuring any _ one _ @xmath172 decay mode , in addition to the @xmath49 , @xmath56 ( and @xmath174 ) @xmath225 decay modes .",
    "as in case [ intro ] , if we measure the cp - conjugate @xmath172 rates as well , then a cp - averaged measurement of the decay rate @xmath47 suffices .",
    "the expressions for the decay amplitudes for @xmath226 and @xmath227 in terms of the @xmath13 invariant amplitudes are identical to those for @xmath162 and @xmath202 , respectively , _ including _ annihilation contributions ( unlike the case of @xmath172 and @xmath176 decays ) , modulo the ckm factors @xcite .",
    "thus , the same method predicts the rates for the @xmath228 decays and the cp - conjugate processes .",
    "it suffices to use the @xmath229 decay ( or its cp - conjugate ) which is a `` self tagging '' mode or the cp - averaged decay rate for @xmath227 .",
    "thus , no external tagging is required .",
    "the analysis of the above three cases is strictly valid only in the flavor @xmath13 limit . in the tree level amplitudes , _",
    "i.e. , _ @xmath124 and the @xmath126 s , the corrections due to @xmath13 breaking can be taken into account more reliably in the factorization approximation and are expected to be given by @xmath230 ( see , for example , gronau _ et al . _ in @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "for example , in fig.[figbpik ] the lengths of @xmath231 , @xmath232 and @xmath233 will have to be multiplied by @xmath230 .",
    "however , since the strong penguin amplitudes include @xmath234 type operators , the ( factorizable ) corrections due to @xmath13 breaking there are less certain , but the corrections are still less than @xmath235 .",
    "this is especially relevant for the cases [ intro ] and [ bpipi ] where the penguin contribution dominates in the @xmath176 , @xmath236 decays and we are _ predicting _ this contribution from the @xmath172 decays using @xmath13 symmetry . in the cases [ bpik ] and [ conclude ] , we use @xmath13 symmetry to predict the penguin contribution in a @xmath237 ( or a @xmath35 ) decay from the @xmath176 decays , but now the _ tree level _",
    "contributions dominate the @xmath172 decay rate and so the uncertainty due to the @xmath13 breaking in the penguin amplitudes is less important .",
    "we have a prediction for more than one rate in some of the cases .",
    "for example , in case [ conclude ] , we can predict both @xmath226 and its cp - conjugate decay rate or in case [ intro ] , neglecting annihilation , we can predict the decay rates @xmath162 and @xmath238 .",
    "so , we can treat the @xmath13 breaking in the penguin amplitudes as an unknown and determine it ( in addition to @xmath0 ) from the measurement of _ seven _ decay rates .",
    "we have also assumed that the @xmath13 breaking in the strong phases is small .",
    "a possible justification is that at the energies of the final state particles @xmath239 , the phase shifts are not expected to be sensitive to the @xmath13 breaking given by , say , @xmath240 ( which is much smaller than the final state momenta ) .",
    "however , it is hard to quantify this effect .",
