    "recent years have witnessed the interesting series of experiments on high temperature superconductors ( hts ) .",
    "these include _ inter alia _ scanning tunnelling spectroscopy measurements which revealed atomic scale inhomogeneities on the surface of bisrcacuo @xcite and the quantum oscillations @xcite which are signatures of the well developed fermi surface .",
    "all these discoveries clearly indicate that after more than 20 years of research , high temperature superconductors ( hts ) still present a challenge and are the objects of intensive experimental @xcite and theoretical studies @xcite .",
    "the scanning tunnelling microscopy ( stm ) experiments are mainly performed on bi family of hts @xcite .",
    "these materials cleave easily and it is straightforward to obtain atomically clean surfaces predominantly with bio surface layer .",
    "this makes bi superconductors also interesting materials to study by means of angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) @xcite .",
    "the strength of stm technique consists in its high energetic and spatial resolution . with stm one",
    "is able to study changes of local properties within the atomic distances .",
    "the poor screening , short superconducting coherence length of cuprate superconductors and low - dimensionality of the electronic structure contribute to large spatial fluctuations in normal and superconducting state properties .",
    "stm measures the quasiparticle excitations , existing at a given energy . from the differential conductance spectra one",
    "e.g. _ local values of superconducting gap .",
    "the study of hts reveals a number of unexpected features in the stm spectra . among those  universally \" observed there was nearly a homogeneous structure of conductance spectra at low energies despite strong variations at higher energies and in particular , inferred gap values @xcite , the asymmetry ( _ i.e. _ @xmath0 ) of the differential conductance @xcite @xmath1 and characteristic dip - hump structure @xcite .",
    "already in the early days of hts , the measured stm spectra have shown high degree of disorder @xcite .",
    "the subsequent more precise experiments allowed for the analysis of the results not only in real , but also in reciprocal space .",
    "it is important to note that with the fourier transformed stm data , the possibility appeared to reconstruct the energy gap @xmath2 , which turned out to be in agreement @xcite with the arpes measurements .",
    "the study of the spatial maps resulted in discovery that the values of the superconducting gaps are _ positively _ correlated with positions of oxygen dopants thus supporting the earlier claims that electronic inhomogeneities and atomic disorder are interrelated . since then inhomogeneities are thus commonly attributed to the presence of disorder @xcite .",
    "the development @xcite of the so called  lattice - tracking spectroscopy \" has enabled investigation of various correlations between the local system properties even at significantly different temperatures .",
    "this resulted in finding that not only the positions of dopant oxygen atoms correlate @xcite with local values of the superconducting gap , but that also the latter property is positively correlated with local density of states ( ldos ) measured in the normal state at a temperature well above that of the superconducting transition .",
    "this correlation indicates that normal state contains information about the interactions responsible for superconducting instability of the system @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study theoretically local properties of hts relevant to the stm experiments .",
    "we describe the superconductor by the two - component boson - fermion ( bf ) model @xcite . for the homogeneous system",
    "the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath3 the @xmath4 operators refer to single fermions and annihilation ( creation ) operators of bosons are denoted by @xmath5 .",

    "coexisting local pairs ( bosons ) and electrons are described by the hamiltonian ( [ bf_hamilt0 ] ) which has been proposed on phenomenological basis @xcite but can also be derived from generalized periodic anderson model @xcite or as a low energy limit of cluster states @xcite .",
    "its relevance to hts and other unconventional superconductors has been demonstrated in numerous works of various groups @xcite . in a broader context",
    "this phenomenological two - component pairing scenario plays a role in a great variety of different physical situations .",
    "( i ) it applies to resonant pairing in cold atomic fermion gases via a feshbach resonance @xcite , ( ii ) it captures the salient features of anderson s resonating valence bond scenario @xcite and ( iii ) it permits to draw conclusions about the pairing mechanism , if given by local dynamical lattice fluctuations , as was the original motivation for proposing this model @xcite .    as in this work",
    "we are concerned with the description of inhomogeneities and correlations observed experimentally , we generalize the hamiltonian ( [ bf_hamilt0 ] ) to the real space and make the parameters random numbers .",
    "it means that disorder is responsible for various kinds of inhomogeneities . in the absence of _ ab - intio _",
    "calculations @xcite of how the boson and fermion parameters behave in an impure system @xcite we study a few scenarios of their possible changes .",
    "it should be stressed that we are not averaging over disorder as experiments measure local values for a given ( fixed ) configuration .",
    "it turns out that with the bf model a number of experimental correlations found in stm can be understood with reasonable assumptions about the role of disorder .",
    "here we shall be mainly interested in the maps of local density of states , the shapes of differential conductance curves as the functions of energy ( applied bias ) as measured at different sites and the values of energy gaps .",
    "preliminary studies of this model have been presented recently @xcite . in literature there",
    "exist numerous attempts to describe theoretically various aspects of the stm spectra in hts cuprates including _",
    "inter alia _ inhomogeneities @xcite , asymmetry of the differential conductance @xcite and dip - hump structures @xcite .",

    "the doping is on the one hand the source of charge carriers in the model , while on the other hand it introduces impurities .",
    "judging from the appearance of superconductivity for finite impurity concentration the plausible assumption would be that impurities modify local values of the parameters in the hamiltonian ( [ bf_hamilt ] ) in such a way as to promote superconductivity .",
    "we thus assume that oxygen impurities in hts are the source of carriers ( holes ) and disorder in the system .",
    "the previous studies of the disordered boson - fermion model concentrated on the bulk properties and required the averaging over configurations . this was achieved by averaging the free energy @xcite or using the coherent potential approximation to calculate the averaged green functions @xcite .",
    "the role of disorder is hard to overestimate in these materials .",
    "it seems that most of their unusual properties may simply be due to an unprecedented degree of disorder resulting from both potential scattering and random values of other parameters .",
    "the simultaneous presence of strong correlations in real materials makes the problem more complicated @xcite even at the mean field level @xcite .",
    "in the two - component model it is the boson - fermion scattering which induces superconducting transition . in this scenario",
    "the pseudogap phase is dominated by the incoherent pairs of bosonic character . to model the initial increase of the superconducting transition temperature with doping",
    "we assume that dopants modulate bosonic levels @xmath103 changing them locally from the value well below or above the fermi level to its vicinity which allows for efficient fermion - boson scattering and superconducting instability .",

    "we limit the discussion to the analysis of the ground state ( @xmath107 ) properties . in the following",
    "we shall compare our results with stm data taken at low temperatures . because the energy gap changes very slowly for temperatures t<0.3@xmath72 , as it is visible in fig .",
    "1 the ground state data can safely be compared with the experiment    as mentioned before , the model and approach allow us to study various kinds of inhomogeneities .",
    "they may result from the local changes of :     @xmath103 , the position of the boson energy level . as we know from the study of the model for the clean system ,",

    "@xmath108 , which can be interpreted as local atomic levels .",
    "this term represents the scattering of fermions by point impurities .    ",
    "@xmath109 , the fluctuating values of hopping parameters .",
    "the fluctuations of this type are not discussed in this paper .",
    "it is the experimental fact that undoped copper oxides are not superconducting .",
    "as noted above , the existence of coupling between the subsystems @xmath17 causes superconducting instability .",
    "it is also evident from figure [ fig - clean1 ] that for superconductivity to appear the bosonic levels @xmath19 have to be close enough to the fermi level .",
    "it seems thus natural to expect that doping of parent compounds introduces carriers into the system and places the boson levels in the close vicinity to the fermi energy . in accordance with such a picture",
    "we study here a few different ( model ) scenarios of doping .",
    "first , we consider random @xmath19 centers , which we also call impurities with parameter values supporting superconductivity .",
    "it means they move locally the boson level towards the fermi level ( c.f .",
    "upper panel of figure [ fig - clean1 ] ) .",
    "second case is another extreme in which contrary to the above expectations impurities move the boson level out of its initial position in the close vicinity of @xmath15 and push it up or down on the energy scale .",
    "this makes the boson - fermion scattering ineffective due to phase space restrictions . in this scenario @xmath19",
    "impurities suppress superconductivity .",
    "the above two scenarios neglect the effect of disorder on the fermion subsystem _ i.e. _ we put @xmath110 . in real systems",
    "one expects that the centers with the boson levels closer to the fermi energy , at the same time are the source of ( presumably strong ) potential scattering for fermions , which in our system is modelled by @xmath90 .",
    "thus as the third scenario we consider the system in which the doping will introduce randomness in both boson and electron on - site parameters . in order not to increase a number of parameters we assume @xcite that in this case",
    "the relation @xmath111 and @xmath112 is valid .",
    "it has to be stressed that in principle there exists an additional degree of freedom which is related to the spatial extent @xcite at which introduction of the impurity into the lattice will modify the parameters of the effective model as ( [ bf_hamilt ] ) .",
    "accordingly we discuss short ( local ) and long range ( extended ) impurities . in the latter case",
    "the impurity at a given site will modify the boson energy levels in neighboring and more distant sites ( see figs .",
    "[ fig - ebi - support]-[fig - ebi - support - extv ] ) .",
