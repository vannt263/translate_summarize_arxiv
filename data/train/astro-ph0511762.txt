    "microquasars are accreting binary systems in our galaxy ejecting jets at relativistic velocities .",
    "the microquasars gro j1655 - 40 and grs 1915 + 105 were the two first superluminal sources discovered in our galaxy .",
    "the dynamical mass of the central object , determined to be 7 m@xmath0 for gro j1655 - 40 @xcite and 14 m@xmath0 for grs 1915 + 105 @xcite , indicates that it is a black hole in both cases .",
    "gro j1655 - 40 and grs 1915 + 105 also share the peculiarity of being thought to contain a maximally spinning black hole @xcite .",
    "asca observations of gro j1655 - 40 in august 1994 and august 1995 provided the first detection of absorption lines in an accretion powered source @xcite .",
    "the energy of the lines was found to depend on the x - ray intensity , being 6.95 kev ( fe xxvi k@xmath1 ) at 2.2 crab , and 6.63 and 7.66 kev ( fe xxv k@xmath1 and k@xmath2 ) at 0.27 - 0.57 crab , revealing the presence of a highly ionized absorber .",
    "similar absorption features were also detected for grs 1915 + 105 @xcite .",
    "after 7 years of quiescence , gro j1655 - 40 started a period of activity in february 2005 , with rxte / asm showing a first outburst between march 10 and april 1 , reaching @xmath32 crab , followed by a month and a half of increasing x - ray flux and a strong outburst on may 20 , when the source reached more than 4 crab . here",
    "we present the results of four xmm - newton observations of gro j1655 - 40 performed on 27 february ( 40 ks , too ) , and on 14 , 15 and 16 march 2005 ( gt , 15 ks each ) .",
    "_ _ ]    ]    the bright state of gro j1655 - 40 at the time of our xmm - newton observations ( almost twice brighter than the crab , the source used for burst mode calibration ) has shown that the charge transfer efficiency ( cte ) in the burst mode has a stronger rate - dependence than previously modeled .",
    "an inaccurate calibration of the epic - pn cte leads to a bad energy determination , which becomes evident in the large residuals around the instrumental si and au edges . from our gro j1655 - 40 observations ,",
    "the offset in energy has been found to be rate dependent , being stronger at the center of the psf , which implies that it can not be directly corrected in the extracted spectrum .",
    "we have determined the cte gain for different rates , selecting and evaluating the energy gain linear factor for spectra extracted from different regions of the detector ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) . we have also included the crab calibration observations to improve the determination of the dependence of the gain linear factor _ f _ with the rate per pixel _",
    "r _ ( cts / s / pixel ) , which we find can be approximated by @xmath4 .",
    "after correcting the event tables with this linear gain , no more residuals appear around the au and si edges .",
    "for our first xmm - newton observation of gro j1655 - 40 , performed on 27 february 2005 , some days before the start of the first outburst , a simultaneous rxte observation is available , which has allowed to determine the x - ray spectrum up to 60 kev .",
    "the simultaneous fit to xmm - newton and rxte / pca data shows that the spectrum can be modeled by a multi - temperature accretion disk , plus a power law with index @xmath31.5 . during our march observations ( with exposures of @xmath315ks ) , performed close to the maximum of the first outburst , the spectra of the epic pn camera , which was used in the burst mode , show that the emission is dominated by the multi - temperature accretion disk component , with kt@xmath5=1.2 - 1.3 kev , hotter than the typical temperature observed during the 1996 - 1997 outburst @xcite .",
    "we detect two absorption features at 6.8 and 8.0 kev , corresponding to fe xxv k@xmath1 and k@xmath2 absorption lines ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ) .",
    "the simultanous rgs data provide the first high resolution spectra of gro j1655 - 40 , showing clear absorption lines at 0.71 and 0.72 kev ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] ) , which could be identified either as ovii at zero velocity , or as a blueshifted fe xviii l - shell doublet .",
    "the blueshift would indicate in this case an outflowing absorber at 3000 km / s .",
    "the absence of other absorption features in the rgs spectrum is puzzling : if the lines at @xmath30.7 kev correspond to ovii k - shell at zero velovity , we would expect to see an even stronger absorption of ovii k@xmath1 at @xmath30.57 kev that is not present ; and if they are fe xviii absorption , fe xvii should be also present .",
    "in addition , the lack of observable oviii and the presence of fe xxv can only be explained by a highly ionized gas , with temperatures higher than @xmath6 kev .",
    "but at higher temperatures , fe xviii would not be expected to be present , constraining the possible temperature of the absorber to a narrow range , higher than the disk temperature derived from its thermal emission ( @xmath7 kev ) .",
    "xmm - newton observed grs 1915 + 105 on 3 may 2004 , with 20 ks exposure time , and the epic - pn camera in the burst mode .",
    "the epic and rgs spectra can be fitted with an absorbed power law , and no evident absorption features are observed .",
    "since the source was not so bright as gro j1655 - 40 , no cte problems are found and no residuals appear around the si and au edges .",
    "nevertheless , the best - fit leaves an excess in the epic - pn spectrum around 1 kev not observed in the two rgs spectra , which could indicate some calibration problem .",
