    "additionally , the data for yvo@xmath0 are strikingly different.@xcite in ref .  , the pronounced peak at 3.5 ev , characteristic of the low - temperature phase , is also observed above @xmath20 , whereas it is not seen at any temperature in ref .  .",

    "the red line for rigid orbital order shows only the reduction by a factor of two stemming from the spin part , because it assumes @xmath72 .",
    "the key feature of this comparison is not the difference in absolute value but the @xmath7 dependence above the ordering temperature .",
    "for rigid orbital order , the sw is nearly constant for @xmath73 and exhibits a clear kink right at @xmath30 .",
    "in contrast , there is no pronounced effect at @xmath30 for strong quantum fluctuations .",

    "these predictions are compared with our results .",
    "the sw of a single absorption band is given by @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the free - electron mass and @xmath76 is the volume per magnetic ion .",
    "we used four lorentz oscillators to describe peaks a - d. the total sw of peaks a and b is shown in fig .  2 .",
    "for all compounds we find nearly constant spectral weight above t@xmath77 , a clear kink at @xmath17 , and also a kink at t@xmath78 .",
    "these findings are in excellent agreement with the expectations for rigid orbital order .",
    "the fact that the changes above @xmath17 are much smaller than below rules out strong orbital fluctuations . also , the total change of the sw is in excellent agreement with theory .",
    "the claim that orbital quantum fluctuations are strong in pseudocubic @xmath2vo@xmath0 is based on the idea that superexchange interactions between @xmath22 orbitals are frustrated on a cubic lattice.@xcite more precisely , orbital quantum fluctuations are blocked in the @xmath29 plane due to the occupied @xmath23 orbital , but they have been claimed to be strong along the @xmath28 axis in the monoclinic phase where orbital fluctuations and ferromagnetic spin order may support each other.@xcite however , distortions away from cubic symmetry give rise to both a crystal - field splitting of the @xmath22 orbitals and a reduction of superexchange interactions . the orthorhombic splitting @xmath79 between the lattice parameters @xmath80 and @xmath81 amounts to 0.03 for @xmath2=y and gd and only 0.003 for ce @xcite while the v - o - v bond angle increases from about 144@xmath82 in yvo@xmath0 to about 156@xmath82 in lavo@xmath0.@xcite our results clearly show that orbital fluctuations are suppressed not only in strongly distorted yvo@xmath0 but also for large @xmath2 ions such as in pseudocubic cevo@xmath0 .    , normalized to the value at 300 k. ]      finally , we address the double - peak structure a / b of the excitation into the lowest multiplet . similar double- and multi - peak structures of the lowest multiplet have been reported for ytio@xmath0 and lamno@xmath0.@xcite the peak splitting has been assigned to either excitonic or band - structure effects , which both have been neglected thus far in our discussion of local multiplets .",
    "we propose that peak a is an excitonic resonance , i.e. , not a truly bound state below the gap but a resonance within the absorption band .",
    "due to an attractive interaction between a @xmath1 state in the upper hubbard band and a @xmath40 state in the lower hubbard band , the energy of the resonance ( peak a ) is less than the energy of peak b where peak b reflects an excitation to @xmath83 without attractive interaction . in order to substantiate this claim , we discuss results from photoemission spectroscopy ( pes)@xcite and from band - structure calculations.@xcite    using lda+@xmath5 ,",
    "_ et al.__@xcite calculated the optical conductivity of lavo@xmath0 and yvo@xmath0 for different polarizations and for different ordering patterns of spins and orbitals .",

    "neither band - structure calculations nor the pes data provide any explanation for the splitting of peaks a and b. electron - removal and -addition spectra do not reflect excitonic effects in contrast to the optical conductivity .",
    "altogether , this strongly supports an excitonic interpretation of peak a.    in simple band insulators , exciton formation is driven by a lowering of the coulomb energy whereas the kinetic energy increases . the term _ hubbard exciton _ refers to an exciton in a mott - hubbard insulator .",
    "such hubbard excitons are of particular interest because of the possible role of the _ kinetic _ energy for the attractive interaction.@xcite in @xmath2vo@xmath0 , the ratio sw@xmath88/sw@xmath89 of the spectral weights of peaks a and b in @xmath66 strongly increases from @xmath2=y via gd to ce .",

    "the sws of both peaks a and b increase , but this increase is much more pronounced for the excitonic peak a. this clearly demonstrates the significant role of orbital order for exciton formation in mott - hubbard insulators .",
    "we propose that this influence of orbital order indicates the importance of the kinetic energy for hubbard excitons in the case of antiferro - orbital order ( here , along @xmath28 ) , as discussed for ytio@xmath0.@xcite along @xmath28 , the motion of an exciton is not hindered by the antiferro - orbital order whereas the hopping of either a single @xmath1 state or a single @xmath40 state leaves a trace of orbitally excited states ( see ref .   for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "this results from the restriction that hopping is essentially only allowed within the same type of orbital , e.g. ,  from @xmath26 on one site to @xmath26 on a neighboring site .",
