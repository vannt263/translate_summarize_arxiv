    "in presenting the foundations of physical chemistry , the basic difference between equilibrium chemical thermodynamics and chemical kinetics is always stressed .",
    "a typical problem of equilibrium chemical thermodynamics ( ect ) is calculating the composition of a chemical mixture that reacts in a closed system for an infinitely long time .",
    "ect does not consider time .    in opposite ,",
    "chemical kinetics is the science of the evolution of chemical composition in time .",
    "some selected results of theoretical chemical kinetics are obtained from thermodynamic principles , especially the principle of detailed equilibrium :    * the uniqueness and stability of the equilibrium in any closed system , see @xcite and the analysis in @xcite ; * the absence of damped oscillations near the point of detailed equilibrium , see @xcite and the analysis in @xcite ; * some limitations on the kinetic relaxation from the given initial conditions , e.g. , based on the known set of equilibrium constants that determine the equilibrium composition , one can find a forbidden domain of compositions that is impossible to reach from the given boundary conditions .",
    "see @xcite .",
    "however , the present dogma of physical chemistry holds that it is impossible to present an expression for any non - steady state chemical system based on its description under equilibrium conditions , except for some relations describing the behavior in the linear vicinity of equilibrium .",
    "the goal of this short note is to announce that , contrary to this ` dogma ' , we have obtained relations of equilibrium type for some non - steady state chemical systems . this has been achieved for all linear cases ( with a general proof ) and some non - linear ones . in a forthcoming extended paper",
    "these relationships will be explained in more detail .    based on our results ,",
    "equilibrium thermodynamic relationships can be considered not only as a description of the final point of temporal evolution , but as inherent characteristics of the dynamic picture .",
    "the following are examples to illustrate our statement ; in all of them we analyze traditional models of chemical kinetics based on the mass - action law .",
    "the processes described by these models occur in a closed non - steady - state chemical system with perfect mixing ( batch reactor ) or in an open steady - state chemical system with no radial gradient ( plug - flow reactor ) , whose description is identical to the batch reactor , replacing astronomic time by residence time .    in this short communication",
    ", we shall analyze a combination of data of different thought experiments , e.g.    * a chemical reactor is primed with a substance @xmath0 only , * it is primed with substance @xmath1 only .    in both cases , we shall monitor both concentrations @xmath0 and @xmath1 and pay special attention to the dependencies of `` @xmath1 produced from @xmath0 '' and `` @xmath0 produced from @xmath1 '' .",
    "we shall use the notation @xmath2 for the temporal concentration dependence of substance @xmath0 , given the initial condition @xmath3 , i.e. , only @xmath0 occurs , with normalized concentration @xmath4 .",
    "similarly , @xmath5 is the concentration of substance @xmath1 for the same initial condition ; @xmath6 that of @xmath0 when at @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "we found interesting relationships between these dependencies .",
    "by elementary mathematical techniques , for @xmath10 , @xmath11    comparing @xmath12 and @xmath13 , it is clear that they are constantly in a fixed proportion : @xmath14 which is the thermodynamic constant of equilibrium .",
    "it is remarkable that this ratio holds at any moment of time @xmath15 , and not merely in the limit @xmath16 .      using , e.g. , laplace domain techniques ,",
    "the following analytical solutions are obtained : if we define the expressions @xmath18 and verify that @xmath19 we can write @xmath20 again , it turns out that @xmath12 and @xmath13 are always in fixed proportion : @xmath14 and again this is the constant of equilibrium of the @xmath21 reaction .      in the laplace domain , defining the symbols @xmath23 the transformed concentrations @xmath24 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are given by @xmath25 and the ratio of the latter two , by @xmath26 where the onsager relationship @xmath27 was used in the final step .",
    "hence for all @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are in fixed proportion given by the equilibrium constant @xmath31 .",
    "since the inverse laplace transform is linear , the same proportion holds in the time domain : @xmath32 similarly , @xmath33 as an example , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the time dependence of @xmath34 , @xmath35 and the time - invariant ratio @xmath36 , for the case of isomerization of butenes in @xcite , eq .  ( 129 ) : @xmath37    this behavior is typical of the examples given here : if the system is started from the initial values @xmath38 , the ratio @xmath34 grows at first from @xmath39 , eventually reaching the equilibrium value ( note that for these parameters @xmath34 slightly overshoots the limit ) .",
    "similarly , when started from @xmath40 , the corresponding @xmath35 initially decreases from @xmath41 and eventually reaches same limit , viz the equilibrium ratio .",
    "but surprisingly the combination @xmath36 is constantly equal to the equilibrium value , for all times @xmath15 .",
    "although the expressions become more involved , it is straightforward to verify that in this case the fixed equilibrium proportions also hold , given the onsager relationship @xmath43 : @xmath32 and similarly for @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "furthermore @xmath47 with a similar relationship for @xmath48 .",
    "we use the terminology and results of @xcite .",
    "let @xmath0 and @xmath1 be substances such that a path from either to the other exists . in view of onsager relations , then there must exist a reversible path from @xmath0 to @xmath1 .",
    "the denominators of @xmath13 and @xmath12 in the laplace domain are the same , but their numerators differ . for @xmath13 ,",
    "the numerator consists of contributions from all forests where @xmath0 is the root of a tree and @xmath1 is in that tree .",
    "let @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 denote other nodes as in the denominator of the left - hand term in ( [ xform ] ) : @xmath52 reversing the @xmath53 and @xmath54 arrows amounts to multiplying the forest s term by @xmath55 . in view of the onsager relations ,",
    "this value does not depend on @xmath50 , but only on @xmath0 and @xmath1 ; in fact , it is the equilibrium constant @xmath56 .",
    "if several @xmath50 or @xmath51 or @xmath49 occur , the reasoning is the same .",
    "consequently , every term in the numerator of @xmath13 is in that proportion to the corresponding term in the numerator of @xmath12 , and the fixed proportion for all @xmath28 translates directly to the time domain : @xmath57",
    "in accordance to the mass conservation law , the balance is @xmath59 in order for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 trajectories to reach the same equilibrium , we choose to start them from @xmath60 and @xmath61 respectively .",
    "the nonlinear differential equation is @xmath62 which can be solved analytically as @xmath63 the remarkable proportion in this case differs slightly from the linear examples : @xmath64 we see that the denominator involves the @xmath0 concentrations of both trajectories , @xmath24 and @xmath13 .",
    "only this can ensure a ratio that equals the equilibrium constant at every time @xmath15 .",
    "the mass conservation law is @xmath66 which offers no difficulties for the initial values , @xmath60 and @xmath67 .",
    "the differential equation @xmath68 can be solved analytically as @xmath69 again eliminating time , the similar proportion for this case is @xmath70 where both numerator and denominator have undergone a duplication in @xmath0 and @xmath1 trajectories , still producing the equilibrium constant at all times @xmath15 .",
    "we are going to describe these results in detail in a full - length paper .",
    "then the similar approach will be applied to different systems , i.e. , cstr reactors , to reaction - diffusion tap systems , etc .",
