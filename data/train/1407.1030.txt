    "since j. bell s monumental discovary to discriminate quantum system from a local realistic model @xcite , the generalization of the theorem to an arbitrary large quantum system became quite important problem @xcite .",
    "the investigation is crucial not just because of the extension of the theorem but also because of the fundamental question whether quantum nonlocality can be an identical notion to quantum entanglement @xcite .",
    "recently , many different approaches in generalization of bell inequalities ( bi ) have been introduced .",
    "they are graph theoretical approaches @xcite , using triangle principle @xcite , and quantum correlation @xcite . even though the step toward the generalization of bell inequalities is making a big progress , there are many problems in this category still left unresolved .",
    "it is mainly because the complexity in finding the maximal bound of the bell function is quite high and the number of relevant parameters are getting to be increased exponecially as it is generalized .",
    "historically , the problem had been summaried under the name of `` all the bell inequality '' and it had been known that it is quite challengeous problem @xcite .",
    "see also e.g. @xcite    the approach using generic correlation have been introduced to identify the general type of bell function in order to obtaining the full set of bell s inequalities @xcite . in the work ,",
    "the set of bell type inequalities for the arbitrary number of high dimensional systems are derived and it is shown that generalised ghz @xcite violates the generic bell inequalities maximally .",
    "however , the optimization for the local realistic bound was limited to a specified set of correlations and the ultimate formalism for the maximal bound of general correlation is still missing .    in the following , we present aximotized formalism of deriving maximal local realistic bound for the generic bell functions .",
    "the main strategy of our optimization method is to focus on the constraint from the arguments of terms in trigonometrically represented bell function . using symmetrical structure in the arguements , one can find the maximal bound of the function by counting the number of independent terms . by applying this formalism to a variant of generic bell function ( gbf ) ,",
    "we illustrate the whole process to derive the maximal bound of the function .",
    "the generic charater of gbf itself will also be discussed in this paper .",
    "we found the form of control factors @xmath0 in gbr with which gbf reduce to ( @xmath1 , 2 ) class bell type functions derived by d mermin , g svetlichny and m ardehali @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as following . in the section",
    "ii , the derivation of maximal bound for the most basic settings of symmetrical bell inequality , named clauser - horn - shimony - holt ( chsh ) inequality @xcite , has been introduced .",
    "the derivation is presented in order to illustrate how the optimization of generalized bell function have been made . in the section iii ,",
    "we provid the definitions of the general form of the generic bell function and we present the precise form of the parameters which are appeared in the functions . in the section iv",
    ", the maximization procedure of the correlation function has been presented . in the section",
    "v , we show that the optimization of the bell function can be applied to various bell type correlations and we conclude our paper in the section vi .",
    "in order to present the basic idea of our approach for the general bell function in @xcite , we start from the most basic settings of the bell s inequality .",
    "the original chsh version of bell s inequality is defined in the situation when two parties have two choices of measurements at each site .",
    "the two choices of measurements are denoted by @xmath2 and @xmath3 where the subscript @xmath4 identifies the measuring parties . in the setting ,",
    "the bell function becomes as @xmath5 where the correlations are given as @xmath6 and so on . in this case",
    ", the local realistic bound can be found rather easily since the average for the measurments @xmath7 is obtained with the probability distribution @xmath8 of the hidden variable @xmath9 and measurement values @xmath10 .",
    "the bound becomes @xmath11 \\le 2\\ ] ] since @xmath12 makes @xmath13 and vice versa .",
    "here , we omitted the hidden variable dependence of the measurement parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 . at the same time , the violation of the local realistic bound can be observed when one evaluates the quantum mechanical average of the correlation as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the vector for the pauli spin operators and the avarage has been taken by one of the maximally entangled state .",
    "the famous cirelson bound is obtained when we consider the full terms @xmath16 and the upper bound is achieved when @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 . with the angles , the values of the correlation functions @xmath21 are @xmath22 except the last term @xmath23 which is @xmath24 .",
    "the proof that @xmath25 is the maximal value can be made through the evaluation of the norm of bell operator which had been provided by cirelson@xcite .    here , we provide the arguement that there can be simpler way to obtain the maximal value for the functional bound of the bell correlation .",
    "the method is quite efficient in general , especially when the number of particles are increased .",
    "however , to see how does the optimization works , we consider the simplest two party case which is the case of the chsh function.the chsh - bell correlation can related with the generic form of the bell function as @xmath26 which has the maximal local realistic value @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28 denotes the complex conjugate of the term in the front . after obtaining the functional form of the correlation",
    ", one can symmetrize the correlation through a proper parametrization for the measurement outcomes .",
    "the function for the measurement value can be written in a form @xmath29 and @xmath30 where @xmath31 . with the parameterization",
    ", the correlation function will be expanded by symmetertized algebric functions and the symmeterization removes the singularity in the coefficient of the correlation terms as , @xmath32.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] due to the modulo structure , the each term in the correlation function can take the value either @xmath22 or @xmath24 only .",
    "once the value @xmath22 is assigned in the first three terms ( by putting @xmath33 ) the last term becomes @xmath24 automatically .",
    "it gives maximum local realistic bound @xmath27 which is true for chsh inequality .",
    "the interesting point in the process of optimization is that the constraint equations with the parameters @xmath34 and @xmath35 does not allow all the correlation terms have maximal value @xmath22 .",
    "so , in this case , the optimization is achieved by counting the maximal number of terms whose value is assigned by largest number without contradicting the constraint equations .",
    "the quantum mechanical bound for the generic bell function can be obtained when the measuring values in the correlation function becomes measurement operators .",
    "the optimized measurement in this case can be obtained as @xmath36 so that the expection value reaches the maximal value @xmath37 where @xmath38 .",
    "the maximal value of the quantum correlation is given by the largest eignevalue and the value is achieved by one of the eigen states .",
    "thus , the optimization procedure for the local realic bound ( and the quantum bound ) is algbrically simpler than the usual optimization with the search of the polytop space , especially when the number of particles are increased and the dimensionality of the system becomes higher .",
    "it is usually simpler since it is counting problem under the constraint equations rather than numerical optimization .",
    "generic bell function is derived by the combinations of all the general correlations in the measurement outcome of multipartite system .",
    "once the combinations of the correlation have been specified , the local realistic bound can be obtained through the algebric optimization procedure . in this section",
    ", we provied the prelimiary definition of the general bell function and derive the functional form of the correlation under the situation of local realistic model .      for our formalism of bell type cirteria",
    ", we need to convert the correlation functions into algebrically analyzable form . by mapping the measurement outcomes in the @xmath39-root of unity function as @xmath40 and so on ,",
    "the correlation function can be expressed by the series of the trigonometric function .",
    "once the correlation function is obtained , inspecting the arguments of trigonometrical terms in the functions , bell functions can be simply optimized by counting the terms . as an example of our formalism",
    ", we will derive maximal bound of generic bell function ( gbf ) .",
    "the trigonometrical representation of the gbf is derived in this section . in the setting of two measurements at the @xmath39-dimensional @xmath1-partite systems ,",

    "shows that bell theorem can not be achieved by simply substituting possible maximum value for all cosine terms . ]    by mapping @xmath49 into complex plane using @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , one can have trigonometrical functional form of the gbf consists of cosine terms only , @xmath50.\\ ] ] where the definition of the combinatorics function @xmath51 in the argument will be provided in the following subsection",
